Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A woman is acquired</b> by, i.e., becomes betrothed to, a man to be his wife <b>in three ways, and she acquires herself,</b> i.e., she terminates her marriage, <b>in two ways.</b> The mishna elaborates: <b>She is acquired through money, through a document, and through sexual intercourse.</b> With regard to a betrothal <b>through money,</b> there is a dispute between <i>tanna’im</i>: <b>Beit Shammai say</b> that she can be acquired <b>with one dinar or with</b> anything that is <b>worth one dinar. And Beit Hillel say:</b> She can be acquired <b>with one <i>peruta</i>,</b> a small copper coin, <b>or with</b> anything that is <b>worth one <i>peruta</i>.</b> The mishna further clarifies: <b>And how much is</b> the value of <b>one <i>peruta</i>,</b> by the fixed value of silver? The mishna explains that it is <b>one-eighth of the Italian <i>issar</i>,</b> which is a small silver coin.
<b>And</b> a woman <b>acquires herself through a bill of divorce or through the death of the husband. A woman whose husband, who had a brother, died childless [<i>yevama</i></b>], can be <b>acquired</b> by the deceased husband’s brother, the <i>yavam</i>, only <b>through intercourse. And she acquires herself,</b> i.e., she is released from her levirate bond, <b>through <i>ḥalitza</i> or through the death of the <i>yavam</i>.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that <b>a woman</b> can be <b>acquired</b> in three ways. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different here that</b> this mishna <b>teaches: A woman is acquired,</b> using the language of acquisition, <b>and what is different there,</b> in the beginning of the next chapter (42a), <b>which teaches: A man betroths,</b> using the language of betrothal? The Gemara explains: In this mishna the <i>tanna</i> utilized the language of acquisition <b>because he wanted to teach</b> about betrothal through <b>money,</b> which is the standard means of exchange in an act of acquisition.
The Gemara continues its explanation: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that betrothal is accomplished by means of giving <b>money?</b> It is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term expressing <b>taking</b> stated with regard to betrothal and <b>from</b> the term expressing <b>taking</b> with regard to <b>the field of Ephron.</b> How so? <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to marriage: <b>“When a man takes a woman”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and it is written there,</b> concerning Abraham’s purchase of the field of the Cave of Machpelah from Ephron the Hittite: <b>“I will give money for the field; take it from me”</b> (Genesis 23:13). This verbal analogy teaches that just as Ephron’s field was acquired with money, so too, a woman can be acquired with money.
The Gemara continues: <b>And</b> the <b>taking</b> of Ephron’s field <b>is called an acquisition</b> in the Torah, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the same issue: <b>“The field which Abraham acquired”</b> (Genesis 25:10).

Daf 2b

<b>Alternatively,</b> it can be proven that purchasing a field with money is called an acquisition from the verse: <b>“They shall acquire fields with money”</b> (Jeremiah 32:44). Consequently, as the <i>tanna</i> wanted to teach that a woman can be betrothed with money, <b>he taught: A woman is acquired.</b> This explains why the terminology of acquisition is used in this mishna.
The Gemara asks: <b>But let</b> the mishna <b>teach there,</b> in the next chapter: <b>A man acquires.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Initially,</b> the mishna <b>taught</b> using <b>the language of the Torah,</b> in which betrothal is called taking. <b>And ultimately,</b> in the next chapter, <b>it taught</b> using <b>the language of the Sages. And what</b> is the reason that betrothal is called <i>kiddushin</i>, literally, consecration, in the <b>language of the Sages?</b> The reason is <b>that</b> through betrothal the husband <b>renders her forbidden to everyone like consecrated</b> property. Therefore, this act is referred to as consecration.
The Gemara asks another question with regard to the difference in wording between the two <i>mishnayot</i>: <b>And let it teach here,</b> as in the following chapter: <b>A man acquires.</b> Why does this mishna teach: The woman is acquired, with the woman as the subject of the sentence? The Gemara answers: This is <b>because</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>wanted to teach</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>And she acquires herself,</b> which is stated <b>with regard to her.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>also taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> stated <b>with regard to her</b> in <b>the first clause.</b>
The Gemara further asks: <b>But</b> if this is the reason, the mishna could have been formulated entirely differently. <b>Let it teach: The man can acquire</b> a woman <b>and transfer</b> authority, i.e., grant her the release from marriage in the form of a bill of divorce. The Gemara answers: The mishna could not use the expression: Transfer, <b>because there is</b> the case of <b>the husband’s death, in</b> which <b>it is not he who transfers</b> authority. Rather, <b>it is from Heaven that</b> her freedom <b>is transferred to her.</b> Therefore, the mishna could not issue a general statement that the man can actively transfer to the woman her release from marriage.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead another explanation. <b>If</b> the mishna had <b>taught:</b> The man <b>acquires</b> the woman, <b>I would say</b> that he can acquire her <b>even against her will,</b> as indicated by the expression: He acquires. One might have assumed that the betrothal depends on the husband, without the need for the woman’s consent. Therefore the mishna <b>taught: The woman is acquired,</b> from which it may be inferred <b>that with her consent, yes,</b> he can acquire her as a wife, but <b>when</b> he acts <b>without her consent, no,</b> she is not betrothed to him.
The Gemara continues to analyze the style of the mishna: <b>And why does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>specifically teach: Three [<i>shalosh</i>]</b> ways, formulated in the feminine? <b>Let it teach: Three [<i>shelosha</i>]</b> ways, formulated in the masculine. The Gemara explains: The mishna uses this form <b>because it wants to teach</b> the word <b>way [<i>derekh</i>], and <i>derekh</i> is formulated</b> in the <b>feminine, as it is written: “And you shall show them the way [<i>derekh</i>] in which [<i>bah</i>] they must walk”</b> (Exodus 18:20). The term <i>bah</i>, which is referring to <i>derekh</i>, is formulated in the feminine.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that which is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Nazir</i> 65b): <b>One examines a <i>zav</i> in seven [<i>shiva</i>] ways [<i>derakhim</i>],</b> where <i>shiva</i> is formulated in the masculine, <b>let it teach: Seven [<i>sheva</i>]</b> ways, formulated in the feminine. The Gemara answers: The mishna uses the masculine formulation of the term seven <b>because it wanted to teach: <i>Derekh</i>, and we find</b> that the word <b><i>derekh</i> is referred to</b> in the <b>masculine form, as it is written: “They shall come out against you one way [<i>derekh</i>], and shall flee before you seven [<i>shiva</i>] ways”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:7). The Gemara asks: <b>If so, the verses contradict each other,</b> as in one verse the term <i>derekh</i> is masculine, and in the other verse it is feminine. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>the <i>mishnayot</i> contradict each other,</b> as in one mishna <i>derekh</i> is masculine while in the other it is feminine.
The Gemara answers: <b>The verses do not contradict each other. Here,</b> that verse: “The way in which they must walk” (Exodus 18:20), <b>is referring to the Torah,</b> i.e., the way mentioned here is referring to the path of the Torah, <b>and Torah is referred to</b> in the <b>feminine form, as it is written: “The Torah of the Lord is perfect [<i>temima</i>], restoring the soul”</b> (Psalms 19:8). The word <i>temima</i> is in the feminine. Consequently, in reference to the Torah the verse <b>writes:</b> <i>Derekh</i>, <b>formulated</b> in the <b>feminine. There, that</b> verse: “Shall flee before you seven ways” (Deuteronomy 28:7), <b>is referring to war,</b> and <b>as it is the way of a man to wage war and it is not the way of a woman to wage war,</b> it is appropriate to speak in the masculine. Therefore, the verse <b>writes</b> the word <i>derekh</i> <b>formulated</b> in the <b>masculine.</b>
Likewise, the <b><i>mishnayot</i> do not contradict each other: Here, where it is referring to a woman, the mishna teaches</b> <i>derekh</i> <b>formulated</b> in the <b>feminine. There,</b> with regard to the examination of a <i>zav</i>, <b>where it is referring to a man, as</b> it is <b>common for a man to undergo an examination</b> to determine if his emission has a cause other than a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>ziva</i>] <b>but it is not common for a woman to undergo an examination, since,</b> unlike a man, <b>a woman is rendered impure even by circumstances beyond</b> her <b>control, it taught</b> and used the word <i>derekh</i> <b>formulated</b> in the <b>masculine.</b> Even if a woman has an emission of blood for a reason other than illness, she is still impure. Consequently, in her case there is no reason for an examination to see what might have caused her discharge.
The Gemara asks another question with regard to the language of the mishna: <b>What is the reason</b> that the mishna <b>teaches: Three [<i>shalosh</i>],</b> formulated in the feminine? This is <b>because</b> it wanted to teach: <b>Ways. But</b> if so, <b>let it teach</b> instead the word: <b>Matters,</b> i.e., a woman can be acquired through three matters, <b>and</b> as this term is masculine, <b>let it teach three [<i>shelosha</i>],</b> in the masculine. The Gemara answers: The mishna did do so <b>because it wanted to teach intercourse</b> as one of these ways, <b>and intercourse is called a way</b> in the Torah, <b>as it is written: “And the way of a man with a young woman, so is the way of an adulterous woman”</b> (Proverbs 30:19–20). For this reason the mishna used the term ways rather than matters.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>This works out well</b> with regard to <b>intercourse,</b> which is referred to as a way. But <b>what is there to say</b> concerning <b>money and a document?</b> The mishna could have used the word matters with regard to these modes of betrothal. The Gemara answers: <b>Because</b> it was necessary to mention <b>intercourse,</b> which is called a way, the mishna used the word way in reference to the other two modes as well.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> would the mishna <b>teach two</b> cases in a particular manner <b>due to one?</b> Since the word way suits only one of the three modes of betrothal, why didn’t the mishna use the term: Matters, on account of the other two? The Gemara answers: <b>These, too, are for the sake of sexual intercourse.</b> Since the marital relationship, in which intercourse is paramount, is the ultimate purpose of betrothal, the mishna considers this clause as the most important part of the <i>halakha</i>.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna, which teaches <i>derekh</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: For what</b> reason <b>did the Torah say: “When a man takes a woman”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:13) <b>and did not write: “When a woman is taken by a man? Because it is the way [<i>derekh</i>] of a man to pursue a woman, and it is not the way of a woman to pursue a man.</b> The Gemara cites <b>a parable of a man who lost an item. Who searches for what?</b> Certainly <b>the owner of the lost item searches for his lost item,</b> not the other way around. Since woman was created from man’s lost side, the man seeks that which he has lost. To allude to this statement of Rabbi Shimon, the mishna employs the term <i>derekh</i> in this context.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One examines a <i>zav</i> in seven ways,</b> why does it use this phraseology? <b>Let it teach</b> the word: <b>Matters.</b> The Gemara answers that the mishna <b>there teaches us this</b> <i>halakha</i>, <b>that it is the way of excessive eating to lead to <i>ziva</i>, and</b> likewise <b>it is the way of excessive drinking to lead to <i>ziva</i>.</b> Therefore, the mishna uses the phrase: Seven ways, to emphasize that there are ways of behavior that can cause the emission of a <i>zav</i>.
The Gemara further challenges: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 2:6): The <i>halakhot</i> of <b>an <i>etrog</i></b> tree <b>correspond to</b> those of <b>a tree in three ways. Let it teach</b> instead: Three <b>matters.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Because it wants to teach in</b> the <b>latter clause: And</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of an <i>etrog</i> tree correspond <b>to</b> those of <b>a vegetable in one way,</b> therefore the mishna uses the term: Ways, in the first clause as well. The Gemara asks: In the <b>latter clause too, let</b> the mishna <b>teach: Matter,</b> rather than: Way.

Daf 3a

The Gemara explains: <b>There,</b> the mishna <b>teaches us this, that</b> the <b>way an <i>etrog</i></b> grows is <b>like a vegetable: Just as it is the way of a vegetable to grow by</b> being watered by <b>all water,</b> i.e., in addition to rainwater it requires irrigation, <b>and its tithing is according to when it is harvested,</b> i.e., its tithing is based on when it is collected from the field, <b>so too, it is the way of an <i>etrog</i> to grow by</b> being watered by <b>all water,</b> as it requires more water than rain provides, <b>and its tithing is according to the time when it is harvested.</b> If, for example, a vegetable is collected during a year when poor man’s tithe is given, that tithe is separated from it, even if it formed a bud during the previous year, when second tithe was separated. The same applies to an <i>etrog</i>. Therefore, the mishna specifically uses the term: Way, to allude to this reason.
The Gemara further asks: <b>But</b> concerning <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 2:8): With regard to <b>a <i>koy</i>,</b> an animal whose classification was uncertain, as the Sages were unsure whether it is a domesticated or a non-domesticated animal, <b>there are ways,</b> i.e., <i>halakhot</i>, <b>in</b> which its <i>halakhot</i> <b>correspond to</b> those of <b>a non-domesticated animal and there are ways in</b> which its <i>halakhot</i> <b>correspond to</b> those of <b>a domesticated animal. And there are ways in</b> which its <i>halakhot</i> <b>correspond to</b> those of both <b>a non-domesticated animal and a domesticated animal, and there are ways in</b> which its <i>halakhot</i> <b>correspond to</b> those of <b>neither a non-domesticated animal nor a domesticated animal. Let</b> that mishna <b>teach</b> the term: <b>Matters. And furthermore,</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 9a): <b>This is one of the ways in which</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>bills of divorce correspond to</b> those of bills of <b>manumission, let</b> that mishna <b>teach</b> the word: <b>Matters.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects the previous explanations, as the phraseology is not dependent on the nature of the topic at hand. Instead, <b>anywhere that there is a distinction</b> with regard to an issue the mishna <b>teaches</b> the term: <b>Ways,</b> as there are different ways or possibilities available. <b>And anywhere that there is no distinction it teaches</b> the word: <b>Matters.</b> The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise</b> in this regard, <b>as it teaches in the latter clause</b> of that mishna that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The <i>halakhot</i> of <b>an <i>etrog</i></b> tree <b>correspond to</b> those of <b>a tree with regard to every matter.</b> This indicates that when no distinctions apply, the mishna will use the term matter. The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from</b> this clause in the mishna that this explanation is correct.
§ The Gemara continues to analyze the language of the mishna: With regard to <b>the number in the first clause</b> of the mishna, i.e., a woman is acquired in three ways, this serves <b>to exclude what?</b> The fact that the mishna mentions a number indicates that other modes of acquisition do not apply to betrothal. What mode is excluded? Similarly, <b>the number in the latter clause</b> of the mishna, that a woman acquires herself in two ways, serves <b>to exclude what?</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>The number in the first clause</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> a wedding <b>canopy,</b> which does not effect betrothal. The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, who said:</b> A wedding <b>canopy acquires</b> a woman, and it alone could be a mode of betrothal, as derived <b>by an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference (see 5a), this number serves <b>to exclude what?</b>
The Gemara answers: The number serves <b>to exclude</b> acquisition through symbolic <b>exchange,</b> i.e., a <i>pro forma</i> act of acquisition effecting the transfer of ownership of an article. Although a woman can be betrothed by means of money or an item of monetary value, she is not betrothed if she is given an item by symbolic exchange. The Gemara explains why this needs to be excluded: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> the Sages <b>derive</b> the acquisition of a woman by verbal analogy between the term expressing <b>taking</b> stated with regard to betrothal <b>from</b> the term expressing <b>taking</b> with regard to <b>the field of Ephron,</b> it can be suggested that <b>just as a field can be acquired through</b> symbolic <b>exchange, so too, a woman can be acquired through</b> symbolic <b>exchange.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> perhaps one should <b>say</b> that <b>so too,</b> it is possible to betroth a woman by means of symbolic exchange. The Gemara answers: This cannot be the case, as symbolic <b>exchange is</b> effective <b>using</b> an item worth <b>less than the value of one <i>peruta</i>, and with</b> an item worth <b>less than the value of one <i>peruta</i>, a woman</b>

Daf 3b

<b>does not render herself acquired</b> by a man.
The Gemara asks: <b>The number in the latter clause</b> of the mishna, that a woman acquires herself in two ways, serves <b>to exclude what?</b> The Gemara answers that it serves <b>to exclude <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> i.e., a woman is not released from marriage through <i>ḥalitza</i>. Without this exclusion it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that this <b>can be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a <i>yevama</i>,</b> as follows: <b>Just as a <i>yevama</i>, who is not released</b> from the <i>yavam</i> <b>through a bill of divorce, is</b> nevertheless <b>released</b> from him <b>through <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> with regard to <b>this</b> married woman, <b>who can be released</b> from her husband <b>through a bill of divorce, is it not logical that she can be released</b> from him <b>through <i>ḥalitza</i>?</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that a married woman cannot be released from her husband by means of <i>ḥalitza</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> perhaps one should <b>say</b> that <b>so too,</b> this is the case, i.e., a married woman can be released from marriage through <i>ḥalitza</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to divorce: <b>“A scroll of severance”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:3), which teaches: <b>A scroll,</b> i.e., a written document, <b>severs her</b> from her husband, <b>and nothing else severs her</b> from him.
§ The mishna teaches that a woman can be acquired <b>with money.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that a woman can be acquired through money? <b>And furthermore,</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 46b): <b>A father has authority</b> over <b>his daughter with regard to her betrothal,</b> whether it is <b>through money, through a document, or through sexual intercourse, from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> she <b>is acquired</b> by her husband <b>with money, and</b> that this <b>money is her father’s?</b>
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The reason is <b>that the verse states</b> with regard to a Hebrew maidservant acquiring freedom from her master: <b>“Then shall she go out for nothing, without money”</b> (Exodus 21:11). The extraneous phrase: Without money, indicates that <b>there is no money for this master,</b> i.e., in this case the master she leaves loses the money he paid for her, <b>but there is money for a different master,</b> i.e., another master receives money for her when she leaves his authority. <b>And who is</b> the other master who can transfer her to someone else and receives money for her? This is her <b>father.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that this money is given <b>to her?</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>How can</b> one suggest <b>this? Her father receives her betrothal,</b> i.e., the money or document of betrothal, when he marries her off to her husband, <b>as it is written: “I gave my daughter to this man”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:16), <b>and</b> shall <b>she take the money?</b> Since he is the one who marries her off, he is certainly entitled to the money of her betrothal.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>applies</b> only when she is <b>a minor girl, as she does not have the power to receive</b> her <b>betrothal.</b> Since she lacks the intellectual capacity, she likewise does not have the legal right to conduct this transaction. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a young woman, who does have the power to receive</b> her <b>betrothal,</b> as a female older than twelve years is considered an adult, <b>let her betroth herself and take the money.</b> The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “Being in her youth, in her father’s house”</b> (Numbers 30:17), which teaches: <b>Any profit</b> she gains in her <b>youth</b> belongs <b>to her father.</b>
The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that which Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the earnings of a daughter,</b> i.e., the profit from her labor, belongs <b>to</b> her <b>father? As it is stated: “And if a man sells his daughter as a maidservant”</b> (Exodus 21:7). This comparison between a daughter and a Hebrew maidservant teaches the following: <b>Just as</b> with regard to a Hebrew <b>maidservant, her earnings</b> belong <b>to her master, so too,</b> with regard to <b>a daughter, her earnings</b> belong <b>to her father.</b> The Gemara now asks: Why does Rav Huna need this derivation? <b>Let him derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the verse <b>“being in her youth, in her father’s house,”</b> which indicates that any profit from her earnings as a young woman belongs to her father.
<b>Rather,</b> Rav Huna maintains that <b>that</b> verse <b>is written with regard to the nullification of vows,</b> and it is not referring to the <i>halakhot</i> of acquisition. The Gemara asks: If that is so, then <b>so too,</b> with regard to her betrothal money, one can say that this verse <b>is written</b> only <b>with regard to the nullification of vows</b> and does not apply to betrothal money. <b>And if you would say: Let us derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of her betrothal money <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the nullification of vows, i.e., just as a father has the right to nullify his daughter’s vows when she is a young woman, so too, he has rights to her money, this is not possible, as there is a principle: <b>We do not derive monetary matters from ritual matters.</b>
<b>And if you would say: Let us derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> of the betrothal of a young woman <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>fines,</b> as it is stated explicitly in the Torah that a man who rapes a young woman must pay a fine to her father, there is another principle that is applicable here: <b>We do not derive monetary matters from fines,</b> as the imposition of a fine is considered a unique case from which ordinary monetary rights cannot be derived.
<b>And if you would say: Let us derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the reimbursements for the <b>humiliation and degradation</b> of a young woman who was raped, which are also given to the father, one can answer that the following distinction applies: Reimbursement for <b>humiliation and degradation</b> are <b>different, as her father has an interest in them.</b> The father has the ability to derive benefit from her humiliation and degradation in other ways, e.g., by marrying her to a man afflicted with boils, which would humiliate her and cause a reduction in her value. Therefore, one cannot derive from the fact that the father receives the reimbursements for the humiliation and degradation of a young woman who was raped that he receives other monies due to her.
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a young woman’s betrothal money belongs to her father is derived from the verse: “Then shall she go out for nothing, without money” (Exodus 21:11), as previously stated. As for the question why the money does not belong to her, the Gemara answers that <b>it is reasonable that when</b> the verse <b>excludes</b> another situation and indicates that there is no money for this master but there is money for a different master,

Daf 4a

<b>it excludes a departure</b> that is <b>like it,</b> i.e., a departure wherein the two masters are the potential recipients. Just as when no money is paid, the individual who might have received the payment is her master, so too, when money is paid, in a different set of circumstances, the money goes to the one who has authority over her, i.e., her father.
The Gemara asks: <b>But this departure is not similar to that departure,</b> as <b>there, she leaves the authority of the master entirely</b> upon being freed and she no longer retains any connection to him, <b>and here, she still lacks</b> the act of <b>passing</b> her over <b>to the</b> wedding <b>canopy.</b> Until she actually enters the wedding canopy, she has not left her father’s authority completely. The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, there is a similarity between her departures in both cases, as <b>she leaves</b> her father’s <b>authority at least as</b> far as <b>the nullification of vows</b> is concerned. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nedarim</i> 66b): With regard to <b>a betrothed young woman, her father and her husband</b> together <b>nullify her vows,</b> and her father cannot nullify them alone.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> does <b>this</b> verse: <b>“Then shall she go out for nothing”</b> (Exodus 21:11), <b>come for that</b> purpose, to teach that there is no money for this master, but there is money for a different master? <b>But it is required for that which is taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse “Then shall she go out for nothing, without money” should be understood as follows: <b>“Then shall she go out for nothing”; these</b> words <b>are</b> referring to <b>the days of adulthood,</b> i.e., a Hebrew maidservant leaves her owner’s authority once she becomes an adult. <b>“Without money [<i>ein kasef</i> ]”; these</b> words <b>are</b> referring to <b>the days of</b> her <b>youth,</b> i.e., when she becomes a young woman she leaves his authority.
<b>Ravina said: If so,</b> that the verse is to be used only for this derivation, <b>let the verse say: <i>En kasef</i>,</b> without the letter <i>yod</i>. <b>What</b> is indicated by the full spelling with a <i>yod</i>: <b><i>Ein kasef</i>?</b> This serves to teach the <i>halakha</i> stated above: <b>There is no money for this master, but there is money for a different master. And who is he?</b> He is her <b>father,</b> who has a right to receive the money when his daughter leaves his authority upon her betrothal.
The Gemara explains: <b>And from where</b> is it derived that <b>one interprets</b> the verse <b>homiletically</b> in <b>this</b> manner? How is it known that the full form of the word <i>ein</i> teaches a <i>halakha</i>? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the daughter of a priest who married a non-priest and was subsequently widowed or divorced: <b>“And she has no child,</b> and is returned to her father’s house, as in her youth, she may eat of her father’s bread” (Leviticus 22:13). This verse indicates that if she has no children from her non-priest husband she may once again partake of <i>teruma</i>.
<b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>her</b> actual <b>children. From where</b> do I derive that <b>her children’s children</b> are equivalent to children with regard to this <i>halakha</i>? <b>The verse states: “She has no [<i>ein lah</i>] child,”</b> where <i>ein</i> is spelled with a <i>yod</i> inserted in the middle. This additional letter serves to enable an alternative articulation of the term, specifically, <b>one examines her [<i>ayyein lah</i>]</b> to see if she has any descendants. <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>children</b> of <b>unflawed</b> lineage, i.e., her legitimate offspring. <b>From where</b> do I derive that <b>children</b> of <b>flawed</b> lineage, e.g., <i>mamzerim</i>, are also considered her children for the purposes of this <i>halakha</i>? <b>The verse states: “She has no child,”</b> which indicates that <b>one examines her,</b> as explained above.
With regard to the last derivation, the Gemara asks: <b>But you have</b> already <b>derived</b> one <i>halakha</i> from this word, that <b>her children’s children</b> are considered like her children in this case. The Gemara answers: In fact, <b>a verse was not necessary</b> to teach about <b>her children’s children, as</b> there is an established principle that <b>children’s children are</b> considered <b>like children.</b> And therefore, <b>when the verse was necessary,</b> it was to teach the requirement of examining her <b>for children</b> of <b>flawed</b> lineage.
The Gemara asks: <b>And the <i>tanna</i> himself, from where does he</b> know <b>that</b> one <b>can expound</b> the <i>yod</i> in <i>ein</i> in <b>this</b> manner? The Gemara answers: <b>They say</b> in explanation that it is <b>written: “Balaam refuses [<i>me’en</i>]”</b> (Numbers 22:14), <b>and</b> it is similarly written: <b>“My <i>yavam</i> refuses [<i>me’en</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:7), and <b>in neither</b> case <b>is a <i>yod</i> written. And here</b> the word <i>ein</i> <b>is written with a <i>yod</i>. Learn from it that</b> the <i>yod</i> is superfluous and <b>comes</b> for the sake of <b>an exposition.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And it was necessary to write</b> a verse that teaches that <b>her betrothal,</b> i.e., the money or document of betrothal, belongs <b>to her father, and it was necessary to write</b> another verse that teaches that <b>her earnings</b> belong <b>to her father,</b> as one could not derive one <i>halakha</i> from the other. <b>As, if the Merciful One had written</b> only that <b>her betrothal</b> money belongs <b>to her father, I would say</b> that this is <b>because she did not toil for it</b> and therefore is not entitled to this sum. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>her earnings, for which she toiled, say</b> that <b>they are hers.</b> Therefore, it is necessary to state that her earnings also belong to her father.
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if</b> the verse <b>had taught us</b> only the <i>halakha</i> of <b>her earnings,</b> one would have said <b>that</b> they belong to her father because his daughter <b>is sustained by him</b> through his property. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>her betrothal,</b> i.e., the money or document of betrothal, <b>which comes to her from an external</b> source, I would <b>say</b> that <b>it is hers.</b> Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> for the verse to teach both <i>halakhot</i>.
The Gemara returns to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself:</b> The <i>baraita</i> states with regard to a Hebrew maidservant: <b>“Then shall she go out for nothing,” these are the days of adulthood; “without money,” these are the days of</b> her <b>youth.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And let the Merciful One write</b> that she leaves her master when she reaches her <b>youth, and it would not be necessary</b> to state that she leaves upon reaching <b>adulthood.</b> If she has already left her master when she becomes a young woman, it is not necessary to state that she leaves him upon reaching adulthood.
<b>Rabba says: This</b> phrase <b>comes and teaches about that</b> phrase. In other words, since it is not explicitly stated that this particular verse is referring to her departure when she becomes a young woman, if there was only one superfluous phrase one would conclude that it is referring to adulthood, as the <i>halakha</i> that she leaves the master when she becomes an adult is a lesser novelty. Therefore, two extraneous verses are required.
Rabba cites an analogous case. This is <b>just as it is</b> with regard to <b>a tenant and a hired worker. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning <i>teruma</i>: The verse states: “A tenant of a priest or a hired worker shall not eat of the consecrated” (Leviticus 22:10). <b>“A tenant”; this</b> is referring to a Hebrew slave <b>who has been acquired as a permanent acquisition,</b> i.e., one who said he wishes to stay with his master. This Hebrew slave has his ear pierced and he remains with his master until the Jubilee Year. <b>“A hired worker”; this</b> is referring to a Hebrew slave who has been <b>acquired for an acquisition of</b> six <b>years,</b> the standard period of servitude for a Hebrew slave.
The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>Let</b> the verse <b>say “tenant” and let it not say “hired worker,” and I</b> would <b>say:</b> If one who is acquired <b>as a permanent acquisition does not partake</b> of his owner’s, i.e., the priest’s, <i>teruma</i>, as despite his status as a Hebrew slave he is not considered his owner’s property, is it <b>not all the more so</b> that <b>one who is acquired for an acquisition of</b> six <b>years</b> should not be permitted to partake of <i>teruma</i>?
The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>If so,</b> that the verse were stated in this manner, <b>I would say: “A tenant”; this is one who was acquired for an acquisition of</b> six <b>years,</b> as the term itself is ambiguous. <b>But one who was acquired as a permanent acquisition may partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>. Therefore, the term <b>“hired worker,”</b> which is certainly referring to one who is less permanent than a tenant, <b>comes and teaches about</b> the meaning of the term <b>“tenant,” that even if</b> a Hebrew slave <b>was acquired as a permanent acquisition he may not partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>. A similar line of reasoning applies in the above case of a young woman and an adult.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rabba: <b>Are</b> these cases really <b>comparable? There,</b> the tenant and the hired worker <b>are two bodies.</b> This is significant, <b>as even if the Merciful One had written</b> explicitly that <b>a pierced tenant may not partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>, from which the <i>halakha</i> of a Hebrew slave for six years could have been inferred, <b>and then</b> the Merciful One <b>wrote the other</b> case of a Hebrew slave acquired temporarily, this would not present a serious difficulty. The reason is that, although the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a hired worker is a matter</b> that could <b>be derived by</b> means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, and therefore it does not have to be stated explicitly, there is a principle: Sometimes with regard to <b>a matter that can be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, the <b>verse</b> nevertheless <b>takes the trouble and writes it</b> explicitly.
<b>But here,</b> with regard to a woman, <b>she is one body,</b> i.e., it is the same Hebrew maidservant. <b>Once she has left upon</b> the arrival of her <b>youth, what</b> is she <b>doing in his</b> authority as <b>an adult?</b> It is entirely unnecessary for the verse to teach that she leaves her master upon becoming an adult, as she has already left him.
<b>Rather, Abaye</b> rejects the previous suggestion that one verse teaches about the other, and <b>said:</b> The claim that the verse “Then shall she go out for nothing” is referring to adulthood <b>is necessary only for the adulthood of a sexually underdeveloped woman</b> who is incapable of bearing children <b>[<i>ailonit</i>].</b> An <i>ailonit</i> will never develop the physical signs of maturity, i.e., two pubic hairs. Consequently, she does not go through the halakhic stage of a young woman. Instead, she remains a minor until the age of twenty, at which point she immediately becomes an adult.
Consequently, if the Torah did not teach that a Hebrew maidservant leaves her master upon becoming an adult, it might <b>enter your mind to say: She leaves</b> only <b>when</b> entering her <b>youth,</b> but <b>when</b> entering <b>adulthood</b> directly <b>she does not leave.</b> Since an <i>ailonit</i> is never classified as a young woman, she would never leave servitude. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that a Hebrew maidservant leaves her master even if she reaches adulthood directly.
<b>Mar bar Rav Ashi objects to this: But is it not an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference? <b>And if the signs</b> indicating that a young woman has entered <b>puberty do not</b> fully <b>release</b> a young woman <b>from her father’s authority,</b> as he can still betroth her, nevertheless, <b>they do release</b> her <b>from the master’s authority; is it not logical that adulthood, which</b> completely <b>releases</b> her <b>from her father’s authority, should release</b> her <b>from</b> the <b>master’s authority?</b> If so, one can derive by this reasoning that an <i>ailonit</i> leaves her master in adulthood, which means the verse is unnecessary.
<b>Rather, Mar bar Rav Ashi says:</b> This verse <b>is necessary only with regard to the basic</b> <i>halakha</i> of the <b>sale of an <i>ailonit</i></b> as a Hebrew maidservant. As it might <b>enter your mind to say that</b> if a female <b>will show</b> the <b>signs of a young woman,</b> i.e., puberty, her sale <b>is</b> a valid <b>sale,</b> whereas in a case <b>where</b> she <b>will not show</b> the <b>signs of a young woman, her sale is not</b> a valid <b>sale.</b> The reason one might think this is the case is that if the maidservant turns out to be an <i>ailonit</i>, one cannot fulfill the requirements of the verse, as she will never become a young woman.

Daf 4b

Therefore the superfluous phrase: <b>“Then shall she go out for nothing,</b> without money” (Exodus 21:11), <b>teaches us</b> that even an <i>ailonit</i> can be sold as a Hebrew maidservant and is released upon reaching adulthood.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi, who said: But is it not an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference that adulthood releases a woman from her master’s authority, how does he respond to the fact that <b>we say</b> in general, with regard to <b>a matter that can be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, the <b>verse</b> nevertheless <b>takes the trouble and writes it</b> explicitly? The Gemara answers: <b>That matter</b> applies only where there <b>is no</b> other way <b>to resolve</b> the difficulty of why a <i>halakha</i> is written when it could be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> inference. <b>But when there is</b> another, more substantial way <b>to resolve</b> the difficulty, <b>one resolves</b> it in that manner.
§ The Gemara notes: <b>And a <i>tanna</i> cites</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a woman can be betrothed with money <b>from here,</b> a different source. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that when the verse states: <b>“When a man takes a woman and engages in sexual intercourse with her, and it comes to pass, if she finds no favor in his eyes, because he has found</b> some unseemly matter <b>in her,</b> and he writes her a scroll of severance” (Deuteronomy 24:1), in this verse, the term <b>taking is only with money. And so it says: “I will give money for the field; take it from me”</b> (Genesis 23:13).
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> is there any need for this derivation? Could this <b>not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference,</b> as follows: <b>And if</b> a Hebrew <b>maidservant, who cannot be acquired</b> as a maidservant <b>through intercourse,</b> nevertheless <b>can be acquired through money, is it not logical that this</b> woman, <b>who can be acquired through intercourse</b> for the purpose of betrothal, <b>can</b> likewise <b>be acquired through money?</b>
Nevertheless, this <i>a fortiori</i> inference can be refuted. <b>A <i>yevama</i> proves</b> otherwise, <b>as she is acquired</b> by the <i>yavam</i> <b>through intercourse, and</b> yet <b>she cannot be acquired through money.</b> The Gemara rejects this refutation: <b>What</b> is unique about <b>a <i>yevama</i></b> is <b>that</b> she <b>cannot be acquired through a document. Will you say</b> that the same applies <b>to this</b> woman, <b>who can be acquired through a document</b> for the purpose of betrothal, and consequently the acquisition of money applies to her as well?
The Gemara reiterates its question. <b>The verse states: “When a man takes</b> a woman.” <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> for <b>this</b> purpose? <b>It was</b> already <b>derived</b> through this <i>a fortiori</i> inference, as the proposed refutation of this inference was rejected. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> It is needed <b>because one can say that</b> the <b>refutation of the</b> <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference</b> is present <b>from the outset,</b> i.e., there is a difficulty with the comparison between a woman and a Hebrew maidservant.
Rav Ashi elaborates: <b>From where do you derive</b> that a woman can be betrothed with money? It is derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>from</b> the case of <b>a Hebrew maidservant.</b> This derivation can be refuted. <b>What</b> is unique <b>about a Hebrew maidservant is that</b> she can be <b>released with money,</b> i.e., she pays her master her value as a maidservant and she is then freed, and therefore she can likewise be acquired through money. <b>Will you say</b> the same with regard to <b>this</b> woman, <b>who cannot be released,</b> i.e., divorced, <b>through money?</b> Since this <i>a fortiori</i> inference is rejected, one must rely on the source cited in the <i>baraita</i>, that <b>the verse states: “When a man takes.”</b>
After mentioning an additional proof for the option of betrothal with money, the Gemara comments: <b>And it was necessary</b> for the Torah <b>to write,</b> with regard to a Hebrew maidservant: <b>“Then shall she go out for nothing,” and it was</b> also <b>necessary to write: “When a man takes</b> a woman.” <b>As, if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“When he takes,” I would say:</b> The <b>betrothal money that the husband gives her is</b> invariably <b>hers.</b> Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “Then shall she go out for nothing,”</b> to teach that when she is not an adult her father has the right to her betrothal money.
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>had the Merciful One written</b> only: <b>“Then shall she go out for nothing,” I would say</b> that in a case <b>where she gave him</b> money <b>and betrothed him, it is</b> a valid <b>betrothal,</b> as this verse does not specify who gives the money to whom. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “When he takes,” and not: When she takes,</b> to teach that only a man may betroth a woman, not vice versa.
The <i>baraita</i> continues to interpret the verse. The phrase: <b>“And engages in sexual intercourse with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>teaches that</b> a woman <b>can be acquired through intercourse.</b> Why is it necessary for the verse to state this explicitly? Could this <b>not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference: And if a <i>yevama</i>, who cannot be acquired through money, can be acquired through intercourse, is it not logical that this</b> woman, <b>who can be acquired through money,</b> as derived above, <b>can</b> also <b>be acquired through intercourse?</b>
The Gemara counters: The case of <b>a Hebrew maidservant proves</b> otherwise, <b>as she is acquired through money and</b> yet she <b>cannot be acquired through intercourse.</b> The Gemara dismisses this refutation: <b>What</b> is distinct about <b>a Hebrew maidservant</b> is <b>that her acquisition is not for the sake of marriage,</b> as she is acquired as a servant. <b>Will you say</b> the same <b>with regard to this</b> woman, <b>whose acquisition is for the sake of marriage?</b> Therefore, it is logical that a woman can be acquired through sexual intercourse.
The Gemara reiterates its question. <b>The verse states: “And engages in sexual intercourse with her.” But why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> for this purpose? <b>It was</b> already <b>derived</b> through the above <i>a fortiori</i> inference. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> It is needed <b>because it</b> is possible <b>to say that</b> the <b>refutation of the</b> <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference</b> is present <b>from the outset. From where do you derive</b> that intercourse is a mode of acquisition? <b>From</b> the case of <b>a <i>yevama</i>.</b>
One could say: <b>What</b> is unique about <b>a <i>yevama</i></b> is that she <b>is bound</b> to the <i>yavam</i> <b>and stands</b> waiting for him to act, and for this reason sexual intercourse is sufficient to render her his wife. <b>Will you say</b> the same <b>with regard to this</b> woman, <b>who is not bound and</b> is not <b>standing</b> waiting for anyone? It is therefore possible that intercourse is not enough to acquire a woman in ordinary circumstances. Consequently, the <i>a fortiori</i> inference does not bear close scrutiny. For this reason an additional proof is required, that <b>the verse states: “And engages in sexual intercourse with her.”</b>

Daf 5a

The <i>baraita</i> continues to discuss the modes of betrothal: <b>And from where</b> is it derived that a woman can be acquired <b>even by</b> means of <b>a document?</b> The Gemara answers: This <b>is a logical derivation,</b> made by an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>And if money, which does not release</b> a woman from her husband, nevertheless can <b>bring</b> her <b>into</b> a husband’s domain by betrothal, <b>is it not logical that a document, which releases</b> a woman from her husband in the form of a bill of divorce, <b>can bring</b> her <b>into</b> a husband’s domain by betrothal?
The Gemara refutes this claim: <b>What</b> is unique about <b>money</b> is that it can effect acquisition in many contexts, <b>as one can redeem with it consecrated</b> property <b>and second tithe. Will you say</b> that the same also applies to <b>a document, with which one cannot redeem consecrated</b> property <b>and second tithe?</b> The proof that one may redeem consecrated property only by means of money is <b>that it is written: “And he will give the money and it will be assured to him”</b> (see Leviticus 27:19). Consequently, this <i>halakha</i> cannot be derived by logical reasoning.
Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And she leaves</b> his house and goes <b>and becomes</b> another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2). This verse <b>juxtaposes becoming,</b> i.e., betrothal, <b>to leaving,</b> i.e., divorce. <b>Just as leaving</b> is performed <b>through a document,</b> i.e., a bill of divorce, <b>so too, becoming</b> can be performed <b>through a document.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And let one also juxtapose leaving to becoming,</b> in the opposite direction: <b>Just as becoming is</b> performed <b>through money, so too, leaving</b> can be effected <b>through money.</b>
<b>Abaye says:</b> If so, people <b>will say: Money brings in and money releases;</b> if so, can <b>an advocate [<i>saneigor</i>] become a prosecutor [<i>kateigor</i>]?</b> It is improper for the same mode that draws man and woman together to be used for the termination of their relationship. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then with regard to <b>a document too, they will say: A document brings in and a document releases;</b> if so, can <b>a prosecutor become an advocate?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>The words of this</b> betrothal <b>document are discrete,</b> i.e., distinct, <b>and the words of this</b> divorce <b>document are discrete,</b> i.e., the two documents differ in content. The Gemara asks: <b>Here too, this money is discrete and this money is discrete,</b> as one coin is for the betrothal and a different coin is used for the divorce. The Gemara answers: <b>In any event, the coin</b> itself <b>is one,</b> i.e., there is no noticeable difference between the coin used for betrothal and one that would be used for divorce. The same cannot be said with regard to documents, as particular texts serve specific purposes, and the same document could not be used for both betrothal and divorce.
<b>Rava said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> that a woman cannot be divorced by means of money is derived from a different source. <b>The verse states: “And he writes her</b> a scroll of severance” (Deuteronomy 24:3). This indicates that a woman <b>is divorced</b> only <b>through writing and she is not divorced through money.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> as this point is not stated explicitly and is inferred from the verse, one can instead <b>say</b> the following interpretation: <b>She is divorced through writing, and she is not betrothed through writing.</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion. It is <b>written: “And she leaves and becomes”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:2), which <b>juxtaposes</b> betrothal to divorce, indicating that betrothal can be effected with a document.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see</b> that you interpreted the verses in this manner? One can say the reverse, that the juxtaposition between betrothal and divorce teaches that in both cases money is effective, while the verse: “And he writes her,” means that she can be divorced but not betrothed through writing. The Gemara answers: <b>It stands to reason</b> that when the verse is <b>referring to divorce</b> it <b>excludes</b> a different mode of <b>divorce.</b> Would a verse be <b>referring to divorce and exclude</b> a mode of <b>betrothal?</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who derives a different exposition from this verse, from where does he</b> derive <b>that</b> a woman <b>cannot be divorced through money?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “A scroll of severance,”</b> which teaches: <b>A scroll,</b> i.e., a written document, <b>severs her</b> from her husband, <b>and nothing else severs her</b> from him.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, <b>what do they do with this</b> verse: “A scroll of <b>severance”?</b> How do they interpret it? The Gemara answers: They <b>require it for</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a document of divorce must be <b>a matter that</b> entirely <b>severs him from her.</b> The text of the bill of divorce must completely terminate the relationship between them.
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 5:12) that if a husband says to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce on the condition that you will not</b> ever <b>drink wine,</b> or: <b>On the condition that you will never go to your father’s house, that is not</b> an act of <b>severance,</b> as she remains restricted by him indefinitely. If he stipulates that she may not do so for <b>thirty days, that is</b> an act of <b>severance.</b> The Rabbis derive from the term severance that any indefinite condition prevents the divorce from taking effect.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yosei HaGelili,</b> from where does he derive this requirement that a bill of divorce must completely sever the ties between husband and wife? The Gemara answers that <b>he derives it from</b> the fact that the verse does not utilize the basic form of the word severance, i.e., <b><i>karet</i>,</b> but rather its conjugate, <b><i>keritut</i>.</b> This indicates an additional principle that is derived from the term. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what do <b>the other</b> Sages derive from the seemingly superfluous use of this word? The Gemara answers: <b>They do not interpret</b> the distinction between <b><i>karet</i></b> and <b><i>keritut</i>.</b>
§ The Gemara asks: It has been shown that <b>one</b> mode of betrothal <b>cannot be derived from another</b> mode of betrothal, as explained in the <i>baraita</i>, but why not <b>let one be derived from</b> the other <b>two</b> methods? The Gemara answers: This is not possible, as, <b>which</b> method <b>will be derived</b> from the others? If you say: <b>Let the Merciful One not write</b> that a woman can be betrothed <b>through a document, and</b> one can <b>derive</b> this mode of acquisition <b>from these</b> modes of acquisition, i.e., intercourse and money, this claim can be refuted. <b>What</b> is unique <b>about these</b> other modes is that <b>their benefit is great,</b> relative to a document, as a woman experiences no enjoyment upon receiving a document.
And if you say: <b>Let the Merciful One not write</b> that a woman can be acquired <b>through sexual intercourse, and</b> one can <b>derive</b> this mode <b>from these</b> modes of acquisition, i.e., money and a document, this too is not possible, as, <b>what</b> is unique <b>about these</b> modes of betrothal is that <b>their acquisition is great.</b> In other words, these modes of acquisition apply in many other situations. Therefore, one cannot derive the unusual acquisition of sexual intercourse from these methods.
If you say: <b>Let the Merciful One not write</b> that a woman can be acquired <b>through money, and</b> one can <b>derive</b> this mode <b>from these</b> other modes of acquisition, this is also not possible, as <b>what</b> is unique <b>about these</b> is that they apply <b>against her will.</b> A <i>yavam</i> acquires a <i>yevama</i> through intercourse even against her will, while a document releases a woman from marriage without her consent in the case of a bill of divorce.
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>money also</b> applies <b>against her will,</b> in the case <b>of a Hebrew maidservant,</b> whose father can sell her to a master without her consent, enabling one to therefore derive from the other two modes of acquisition, i.e., intercourse and a document, that a woman can be acquired through money, this opinion can be refuted as well: <b>In any event, with regard to marriage, we do not find</b> a case in which a woman can be acquired through money against her will. Consequently, none of these modes of acquisition can be derived from any of the others.
§ <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The ceremony of the wedding <b>canopy effects acquisition</b> of the woman, as is derived <b>through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If money, which does not enable</b> the wife <b>to partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> as the daughter of a non-priest betrothed to a priest may not yet partake of <i>teruma</i>, <b>effects acquisition</b> of a woman for betrothal, <b>is it not logical that</b> a wedding <b>canopy, which enables her to partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> as once a woman has entered the wedding canopy it is permitted for her to partake of <i>teruma</i> due to her husband the priest, <b>should</b> also <b>effect acquisition</b> of a woman by her husband?
The Gemara asks: <b>And does</b> betrothal <b>money not enable</b> a woman <b>to partake of</b> <i>teruma</i>? <b>But didn’t Ulla say: By Torah law the daughter of a non-priest</b> who is <b>betrothed</b> to a priest may <b>partake of <i>teruma</i></b> immediately upon her betrothal, <b>as it is stated: “But if a priest buy any soul, the acquisition of his money,</b> he may eat of it” (Leviticus 22:11), <b>and this</b> woman <b>is</b> considered <b>the acquisition of his money.</b>
<b>And what is the reason</b> that the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>she may not partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>? It is a rabbinic <b>decree lest they pour her a cup</b> of <i>teruma</i> wine <b>in her father’s house,</b> where she is staying before her marriage, <b>and she give to her brothers and sisters to drink,</b> as it is prohibited for them to partake of <i>teruma</i>. If so, by Torah law a woman may partake of <i>teruma</i> once she has been betrothed with money. Consequently, the above <i>a fortiori</i> inference that entering a wedding canopy can effect betrothal is invalid.
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara emends Rav Huna’s statement and says that <b>he refutes</b> the opinion that entering a wedding canopy does not effect betrothal <b>as follows: If money, which does not complete</b> the acquisition of a woman, as a young woman remains under her father’s authority with regard to certain issues, nevertheless <b>effects acquisition</b> of her for the stage of betrothal,

Daf 5b

<b>is it not logical that</b> a wedding <b>canopy, which completes</b> the marriage, since it entirely removes a young woman from her father’s authority, <b>can effect acquisition</b> for betrothal on its own? The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about money is that</b> it can effect acquisition in many contexts, <b>as one can redeem with it consecrated</b> property <b>and second tithe.</b> This is not so with regard to a wedding canopy, which is ineffective in effecting any acquisition other than marriage. Therefore, in the case of betrothal, money can effect betrothal while a wedding canopy cannot. The Gemara counters: The <i>halakha</i> of <b>sexual intercourse proves</b> otherwise, as this act serves to effect acquisition of a woman despite the fact that it is not a valid mode of acquisition in any other case.
The Gemara counters: <b>What</b> is unique about <b>sexual intercourse</b> is <b>that it effects acquisition of a <i>yevama</i>,</b> whereas a <i>yavam</i> does not acquire her via a wedding canopy. The Gemara answers: <b>Money proves</b> otherwise, as money cannot be used to acquire a <i>yevama</i>, and yet it is a valid mode for acquiring a woman. <b>And the derivation has reverted</b> to its starting point: <b>The aspect of this</b> mode, money, <b>is not like the aspect of that</b> mode, intercourse, <b>and the aspect of that</b> mode, intercourse, <b>is not like the aspect of this</b> mode, money. <b>Their common denominator is that they generally effect acquisition, and they effect acquisition here,</b> with regard to betrothal. <b>Likewise, I will bring</b> the mode of a wedding <b>canopy, which generally effects acquisition,</b> rendering a woman as married, <b>and</b> therefore it should also <b>effect acquisition here.</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>What</b> about the fact that <b>the common denominator of</b> money and intercourse is <b>that their benefit,</b> i.e., pleasure, <b>is great?</b> The Gemara says: The case of <b>a document proves</b> otherwise, as no great pleasure is derived from receiving a document, and yet it can be used to acquire a woman. The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> is unique about <b>a document is that it can release a Jewish woman</b> from her husband in the form of a bill of divorce. The Gemara answers: <b>Money and intercourse prove</b> otherwise, as they do not release a woman and yet they are valid modes of acquisition for betrothal.
<b>And</b> once again, <b>the derivation has reverted</b> to its starting point: <b>The aspect of this</b> mode <b>is not like the aspect of that</b> mode, <b>and the aspect of that</b> mode <b>is not like the aspect of this</b> mode. <b>Their common denominator is that they generally effect acquisition and they effect acquisition here,</b> with regard to betrothal. <b>Likewise, I will bring</b> the mode of a wedding <b>canopy, which generally effects acquisition, and</b> therefore it should also <b>effect acquisition here.</b>
The Gemara again rejects this claim: <b>What</b> about the fact that <b>the common denominator of</b> all three modes of acquisition is <b>that they are</b> effective in certain situations <b>against her will?</b> A bill of divorce, sexual intercourse in the case of a <i>yevama</i>, and money with regard to a Hebrew maidservant all effect acquisition of a woman against her will. Therefore, the mode of a wedding canopy cannot be derived from these methods, as a wedding canopy is effective only when the woman enters it willingly. <b>And</b> in response to this claim <b>Rav Huna</b> would answer: <b>In any event, with regard to marriage, we have not found</b> a case in which a woman can be acquired through <b>money against her will.</b> Consequently, it is possible to learn from the modes of money, a document, and intercourse that a wedding canopy likewise effects betrothal.
<b>Rava said:</b> There are <b>two refutations of</b> this <b>matter,</b> i.e., it is possible to refute Rav Huna’s opinion in two ways. <b>One</b> opinion is <b>that we learned</b> in the mishna that a woman can be acquired through <b>three</b> modes of acquisition, <b>and we did not learn</b> that there are <b>four</b> modes. This indicates that there are no other ways to acquire a woman apart from the three listed in the mishna.
<b>And furthermore,</b> Rava disagrees with the main point of the proof, which was based on the fact that a wedding canopy completes a marriage: <b>Doesn’t</b> entering a wedding <b>canopy complete</b> a marriage <b>only by</b> means of an act of <b>betrothal,</b> which precedes the wedding canopy? <b>And can one derive</b> that entering a wedding <b>canopy</b> effects acquisition <b>without betrothal from</b> the case of entering a wedding <b>canopy that</b> effects acquisition <b>by</b> means of <b>betrothal?</b> Consequently, entering a wedding canopy alone cannot effect a betrothal.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava in response to his two claims: With regard to <b>that which you said,</b> that <b>we learned</b> in the mishna <b>three</b> modes <b>and we did not learn</b> that there are <b>four</b> modes, this is no proof, as the <b><i>tanna</i> teaches</b> only <b>a matter that is explicitly written</b> in the Torah, and <b>does not teach a matter that is not explicitly written</b> in the Torah, such as a wedding canopy.
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>that which you said: Doesn’t</b> entering a wedding <b>canopy complete</b> a marriage <b>only by</b> means of an act of <b>betrothal, this is also what Rav Huna is saying,</b> i.e., Rav Huna incorporates this claim into his reasoning: <b>If money, which does not complete</b> a marriage <b>after money,</b> i.e., after a woman has been betrothed through money an additional monetary gift cannot render her a fully married woman, <b>effects acquisition</b> of the woman in the form of betrothal, <b>is it not logical that</b> entering a wedding <b>canopy,</b> which is more powerful than money in that it <b>completes</b> a marriage <b>after money, should effect acquisition</b> and be used to perform betrothal by itself?
§ After discussing the sources for the modes of acquisition listed in the mishna, the Gemara analyzes these <i>halakhot</i> in greater detail. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:1): <b>How</b> is betrothal performed <b>through money?</b> If a man <b>gave</b> a woman <b>money or</b> an item <b>worth money, and</b> he <b>said to her: You are hereby betrothed [<i>mekuddeshet</i>] to me,</b> or: <b>You are hereby betrothed [<i>me’oreset</i>] to me,</b> or: <b>You are to me as a wife,</b> then <b>she is betrothed. But</b> if <b>she</b> is the one <b>who gave</b> the money to him, <b>and she said: I am hereby betrothed [<i>mekuddeshet</i>] to you,</b> or: <b>I am hereby betrothed [<i>me’oreset</i>] to you,</b> or: <b>I am hereby to you as a wife,</b> then <b>she is not betrothed.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa objects to this:</b> This <i>baraita</i> contains an internal contradiction. The first part of the <i>baraita</i> states: If a man gave a woman money and said to her: You are hereby betrothed to me, from which it may be inferred <b>that the reason</b> the woman is betrothed is that <b>he gave</b> her money <b>and he said</b> the appropriate formula. This leads to the conclusion that if <b>he gave</b> her money <b>and she said</b> the formula, <b>she is not betrothed.</b> Now <b>say the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But</b> if <b>she</b> is the one <b>who gave</b> the money to him, <b>and she said:</b> I am hereby betrothed to you, then <b>it is not</b> a valid <b>betrothal.</b> Rav Pappa infers: <b>The reason</b> that it is not a valid betrothal is that <b>she gave</b> money to him <b>and she said</b> the appropriate formula, from which it may be inferred that if <b>he gave</b> money to her <b>and she said</b> the appropriate formula, then <b>this is</b> a valid <b>betrothal.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>The first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>exact,</b> and therefore it is correct to infer that which was not explicitly stated from this ruling. By contrast, <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> was <b>cited for no reason,</b> i.e., it was simply formulated in the opposite manner of the first clause, and the <i>baraita</i> is not exact in the wording of this case. Therefore, one should not analyze this clause too carefully and infer <i>halakhot</i> from it. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> would the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> in <b>the latter clause a matter that contradicts the first clause?</b>
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara retracts the previous explanation in favor of the following. <b>This is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If <b>he gave</b> the money <b>and he said</b> the formula, it <b>is obvious that it is</b> a valid <b>betrothal.</b> If <b>he gave</b> the money <b>and she said</b> the formula, <b>it is considered as though she gave</b> the money <b>and she said</b> the formula, <b>and</b> therefore <b>it is not</b> a valid <b>betrothal. And if you wish, say</b> a different explanation of the <i>baraita</i>: If <b>he gave</b> the money and <b>he said</b> the formula, <b>she is betrothed.</b> If <b>she gave</b> the money <b>and she said</b> the formula, <b>she is not betrothed</b> at all. If <b>he gave</b> the money <b>and she said</b> the formula, the ruling <b>is uncertain, and by rabbinic law we are concerned</b> that this might actually be a betrothal.
The Gemara continues to discuss the language of betrothal. <b>Shmuel says: With regard to betrothal,</b> if <b>he gave her money or</b> an item <b>worth money, and said to her: You are hereby betrothed [<i>mekuddeshet</i>],</b> or: <b>You are hereby betrothed [<i>me’oreset</i>],</b> or: <b>You are hereby as a wife,</b> then <b>she is betrothed.</b> If he said: <b>I am hereby your man,</b> or: <b>I am hereby your husband,</b> or: <b>I am hereby your betrothed,</b> then <b>there is no room for concern here.</b> In these cases there is no possibility that it might be a valid betrothal, as betrothal is effective only if its formulation defines the relationship in terms of the woman’s connection to the man, not the reverse.
<b>And similarly, with regard to divorce,</b> if a husband <b>gave</b> his wife a bill of divorce <b>and said to her: You are hereby sent away,</b> or: <b>You are hereby divorced,</b> or: <b>You are hereby permitted to</b> marry <b>any man,</b> then <b>she is divorced.</b> If he said: <b>I am not your man,</b> or: <b>I am not your husband,</b> or: <b>I am not your betrothed,</b> then <b>there is no room for concern,</b> as a bill of divorce is effective only if its formulation defines the relationship in terms of the woman’s connection to the man, not the reverse.
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: Is this to say that Shmuel holds</b> that <b>ambiguous intimations,</b> i.e., incomplete expressions that can be understood only from their context, <b>are</b> considered like unambiguous <b>intimations?</b> In the cases listed by Shmuel, the woman is betrothed despite the fact that the man did not say: You are hereby betrothed to me, but merely: You are hereby betrothed. The statement itself does not include the detail that the speaker intends to betroth her to himself, and yet Shmuel maintains that the betrothal is valid.
Rav Pappa asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Nazir</i> 2a) that <b>one who says: I shall be, is a nazirite? And we discussed</b> this ruling: <b>But perhaps</b> he meant <b>to say: I will be in a fast? And Shmuel said</b> that <b>this</b> mishna <b>is</b> referring to a particular set of circumstances, that he said: I shall be, <b>when a nazirite was passing before him.</b> In that context it is clear the individual meant that he too will be a nazirite. Rav Pappa analyzes this statement: <b>The reason</b> that he is a nazirite is only due to the fact <b>that a nazirite passes before him.</b> But <b>if this</b> were <b>not</b> the case, <b>no,</b> his statement would not be considered a naziriteship vow. This indicates that according to Shmuel, ambiguous intimations are not considered like unambiguous intimations.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> Shmuel is referring to a case <b>where he said</b> the formulation and added the phrase: <b>To me.</b> For example, he said to a woman: You are hereby betrothed to me. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what is</b> Shmuel <b>teaching us?</b> If the man stated the full formula it is obvious that she is betrothed, as he used the standard expression of betrothal. The Gemara answers: <b>These</b>

Daf 6a

<b>last expressions</b> are <b>what he teaches us.</b> The novelty of Shmuel’s statement is that with regard to the second set of pronouncements there is no concern at all that a valid betrothal or divorce might have been performed. The Gemara explains why according to Shmuel these pronouncements are not of concern. <b>Here,</b> in the case of betrothal, it is <b>written: “When</b> a man <b>takes</b> a woman” (Deuteronomy 24:1), which indicates that the man is acting to change the status of the woman, <b>and</b> it is <b>not</b> written <b>that he takes himself</b> or gives himself to her, as in the case of one who says: I am hereby your man. <b>And</b> likewise, it is <b>written here,</b> with regard to divorce: <b>“And sends her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and</b> it is <b>not</b> written <b>that he sends himself</b> from her, as in the case of one who says: I am not your man.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if a man says to a woman: <b>You are hereby my wife,</b> or: <b>You are hereby my betrothed,</b> or: <b>You are hereby acquired to me,</b> then <b>she is betrothed.</b> If he said to her: <b>You are hereby mine,</b> or: <b>You are hereby under my authority,</b> or: <b>You are hereby bound to me,</b> then <b>she is betrothed.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> as the <i>halakha</i> is that she is betrothed with regard to both sets of statements, <b>let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach all of them together.</b> Why does the <i>baraita</i> divide these statements into two groups? The Gemara answers: <b>The <i>tanna</i> heard them as two sets of three, and</b> consequently <b>he taught them</b> in that form. He heard each sequence of three cases as a separate <i>halakha</i> from his teachers, and therefore he preserved them as two sets of three.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If a man betrothing a woman said: You are hereby <b>unique to me, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is this woman betrothed? Similarly, if he said to her: You are hereby <b>designated to me, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he said: You are hereby <b>my helper, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he said: You are hereby <b>my counterpart, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he said: You are hereby <b>my gathered one, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he said: You are hereby <b>my rib, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he said: You are hereby <b>my closed one, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he said: You are hereby <b>beneath me, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he said: You are hereby <b>my seized one, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Finally, if he said: You are hereby <b>my taken one, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Resolve at least one</b> of these dilemmas, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who says</b> to a woman: You are hereby <b>my taken one, she is betrothed, because it is stated: “When a man takes a woman”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1).
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If a man says to a woman: You are hereby <b>my espoused one [<i>ḥarufati</i>], what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that with regard to <b>one who says:</b> You are hereby <b>my espoused one, she is betrothed, as in Judea they call a betrothed woman a <i>ḥarufa</i>, an espoused woman.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And is Judea most of the world?</b> Even if this is true in Judea, why should a <i>halakha</i> that applies in all locations be based on this local custom?
The Gemara answers that <b>this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> With regard to <b>one who says:</b> You are hereby <b>my espoused one, she is betrothed, as it is stated: “Who is a maidservant espoused [<i>neḥerefet</i>] to a man”</b> (Leviticus 19:20). This verse means that she is betrothed to a certain man. <b>And furthermore,</b> the <i>baraita</i> adds another proof for this claim: <b>In Judea they call a betrothed woman a <i>ḥarufa</i>, an espoused woman.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it reasonable to introduce the custom in <b>Judea</b> with the term: <b>And furthermore,</b> as proof <b>to</b> a <i>halakha</i> derived from <b>a verse? Rather,</b> the Gemara explains that <b>this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> With regard to <b>one who says:</b> You are hereby <b>espoused, in Judea, she is betrothed, as in Judea they call a betrothed woman a <i>ḥarufa</i>, an espoused woman.</b>
The Gemara asks a general question with regard to all the previously mentioned expressions: <b>With what are we dealing? If we say</b> that these dilemmas are referring to a case <b>where he was not speaking with her about matters of her bill of divorce or her betrothal,</b> but suddenly issued this statement to her, <b>from where does she know what he is saying to her?</b> Out of context, these statements are not necessarily referring to betrothal. <b>Rather,</b> they are referring to a case <b>where he was speaking to her about matters of her bill of divorce and her betrothal.</b>But if so, <b>even though he did not say</b> anything, she would <b>also</b> be betrothed if he gave her money for the purpose of betrothal.
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 4:7): If <b>one was speaking with a woman about matters of her bill of divorce or her betrothal, and he gave her a bill of divorce or her betrothal,</b> i.e., the money or a document of betrothal, <b>but did not clarify</b> his action, <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> This <b>is sufficient for him,</b> i.e., it is a valid divorce or betrothal because she will understand his intention from the context. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He is required to clarify</b> the meaning of his behavior. <b>And Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> If so, even if he said nothing to her she would still be betrothed, and this should certainly be the case if he says one of the statements under discussion.
The Sages <b>say</b> in explanation of this matter: <b>Actually,</b> we are dealing with cases <b>where he was speaking to her about matters of her bill of divorce and her betrothal, and if</b> it was referring to a case <b>where he</b> had <b>given her</b> the money <b>and been silent, so too</b> it would have been a valid betrothal. <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> This is a case <b>where he gave her</b> something <b>and said to her</b> one <b>of these expressions.</b>
<b>And this is the dilemma raised before</b> the Sages: <b>These expressions, did he say them to her for</b> the purpose of <b>betrothal, or perhaps he said</b> them <b>to her for</b> the purpose of <b>labor?</b> He might have intended to hire her, withdrawing his previous intention to betroth her. In other words, his statement in conjunction with his giving of an item renders the meaning of the expression less clear than if he had remained silent. The Gemara leaves most of these issues unanswered, and states that the dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself:</b> If <b>he was speaking to the woman about matters of her bill of divorce or her betrothal, and he gave her bill of divorce or her betrothal to her and did not clarify</b> his intention, <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> This <b>is sufficient for him. Rabbi Yehuda says: He is required to clarify. Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: And this</b> is the <i>halakha</i> provided <b>that they were discussing the same issue</b> and had not moved on to a different topic.
<b>And likewise, Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says: And this</b> is the <i>halakha</i> provided <b>that they were discussing the same issue.</b> The Gemara comments: This disagreement is <b>like</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> on this topic. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: And this</b> is the <i>halakha</i> provided <b>that they were discussing the same issue. Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon says:</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>despite</b> the fact <b>that they were not discussing the same issue.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And if they were not discussing the same issue, from where does she know what he is saying to her?</b> They have already changed the topic of conversation, and these expressions on their own are ambiguous. <b>Abaye said:</b> They have not changed to an entirely different topic; rather, they changed <b>from</b> discussing one <b>topic to</b> discussing another <b>topic within the same</b> general <b>topic.</b> In other words, they were no longer speaking directly about divorce or betrothal, but they were still discussing related matters. Therefore, his intention was clear to her when he made his statement.
<b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei. Rav Yeimar said to Rav Ashi: But</b> if so, with regard to <b>that</b> which <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Anyone who does not know the nature of bills of divorce and betrothals should have no dealings in them,</b> i.e., he may not serve as a judge in cases of this kind lest he permit that which is prohibited, does this principle apply <b>even</b> if that individual <b>did not hear this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>that Rav Huna</b> says that <b>Shmuel says?</b> Since this type of case is uncommon, should such an individual be considered unfamiliar with the <i>halakhot</i> of bills of divorce and betrothals? Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Yes,</b> it <b>is indeed so;</b> this person is considered to lack the requisite knowledge to deal with these cases. This ruling is an important matter with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of betrothal, and one who is unaware of it might err.
The Gemara returns to Shmuel’s statement. <b>And similarly, with regard to divorce:</b> If a husband <b>gave</b> his wife <b>her bill of divorce and said to her: You are hereby sent away,</b> or: <b>You are hereby divorced,</b> or: <b>You are hereby permitted to</b> marry <b>any man,</b> then <b>she is divorced.</b> The Gemara comments: It <b>is obvious</b> that if a husband <b>gave her a bill of divorce and said to his wife: You are hereby a free woman,</b>

Daf 6b

<b>he has said nothing,</b> as this statement is not a valid expression of divorce. Similarly, if a master <b>said to his female</b> Canaanite <b>slave</b> upon emancipating her: <b>You are hereby permitted to any man, he has not said anything.</b>
The Gemara addresses a less straightforward case: If a man <b>said to his wife: You are hereby for yourself, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>he said</b> this <b>to her only with regard to work?</b> In other words, he might have meant that she may keep her earnings. <b>Or perhaps he said to her</b> that she is on her own <b>entirely,</b> i.e., she is divorced.
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The essence of a bill of manumission</b> is the expression: <b>You are hereby a freeman,</b> or: <b>You are hereby for yourself. Now</b> consider, <b>if</b> in the case of <b>a Canaanite slave, whose body belongs to</b> the master, even so, <b>when</b> the master <b>says to him: You are hereby for yourself,</b> this is considered as though <b>he said to him</b> that he <b>is entirely</b> on his own and is freed, then <b>all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear <b>that a wife, whose body is not owned</b> by her husband, is divorced by means of this expression?
With regard to the same issue, <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi:</b> If <b>one said to his</b> Canaanite <b>slave: I have no business with you, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that when <b>he said to him: I have no business with you,</b> he meant <b>entirely,</b> and therefore the slave is freed? <b>Or</b> did he <b>perhaps say</b> this <b>to him with regard to labor?</b> In other words, it is possible that the master is relieving the slave of his obligation to perform labor without actually emancipating him from slavery.
<b>Rav Naḥman said to Rav Ashi, and some say Rav Ḥanin from Meḥoza</b> said <b>to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear:</b> With regard to <b>one who sells his</b> Canaanite <b>slave to a gentile,</b> the slave <b>is emancipated but</b> nevertheless <b>requires a bill [<i>get</i>] of manumission from his first master.</b> In this manner the Sages penalized this owner for preventing the slave from fulfilling the mitzvot in which he is obligated.
<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says</b> in addition to this: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> This is referring to a situation <b>where he did not write a document [<i>ono</i>] for</b> the slave when he sold him to the gentile. <b>But</b> if <b>he wrote a document for him, this</b> itself <b>is his emancipation.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this <b>document? Rav Sheshet said</b> that <b>he writes to him: When you escape from him I have no business with you.</b> This indicates that the formula: I have no business with you, is a valid expression of emancipation.
§ <b>Abaye says:</b> With regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with a loan,</b> i.e., he previously lent this woman money and he now says that she is betrothed to him by means of that loan, <b>she is not betrothed.</b> The reason is that a woman can be betrothed only through her acceptance of money, or an item that has monetary value, at the time of the betrothal. Although this woman owes the man money, at the time the man states that she is betrothed to him, the loan is not in fact money but an obligation. Therefore, he does not actually give her anything at the time of the betrothal. By contrast, if he betroths her <b>by</b> means of <b>the benefit of the loan, she is betrothed. But it is prohibited to do so, due to</b> the fact that betrothing a woman via the benefit of a loan is <b>an artifice</b> used to circumvent the prohibition <b>of</b> receiving <b>interest,</b> as this enables the husband to gain an additional benefit from the loan.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is meant</b> by <b>this</b> term: <b>The benefit of the loan? If we say that</b> it means that <b>he established</b> interest <b>upon it</b> when she took the loan, e.g., <b>he said to her</b> that he is lending her <b>four</b> coins <b>in</b> exchange for the repayment of <b>five,</b> and he betroths her by releasing her from the obligation to pay this additional coin, <b>this is</b> a case of <b>full-fledged interest,</b> not merely an artifice used to circumvent the prohibition of receiving interest. He is receiving full payment of the loan and an additional benefit. <b>And furthermore,</b> when he releases her from the obligation to pay this additional coin, he is simply forgoing another obligation she has toward him; he is not giving her anything. <b>This is</b> like a regular case of a betrothal with <b>a loan,</b> and therefore she should not be betrothed.
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where he extended the time</b> of the loan <b>for her.</b> When the time for her to repay the loan arrived he extended the deadline and betrothed her with the financial benefit she receives from the extra time he is giving her to use the money. In this case he does betroth her with the value he is giving her at that time, but it is similar to interest, as it is included in the prohibition of interest to pay the creditor for an extension of the time of a loan.
§ <b>Rava says:</b> With regard to one who says to another: <b>Here are one hundred dinars for you</b> that I am giving you <b>on the condition that you return them to me,</b> if he gave these one hundred dinars as part <b>of a purchase, he does not acquire</b> the item, as he has not given the seller any money. And similarly, <b>with regard to a woman,</b> if he gave her money for her betrothal on the condition that she return it, <b>she is not betrothed.</b> If one gave money in this manner <b>for</b> the <b>redemption of</b> his firstborn <b>son,</b> for which a priest must receive five <i>sela</i>, <b>his son is not redeemed.</b>
If one does this <b>with regard to <i>teruma</i>,</b> i.e., he gives produce to a priest as <i>teruma</i> on the condition that it will be returned, <b>he has</b> technically <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation of <b>giving.</b> Once he gets the <i>teruma</i> back it belongs to him, as he is the original owner, and although it is prohibited for him to partake of it, as he is a non-priest, he may sell it to a different priest. <b>But it is prohibited to do this,</b> i.e., give <i>teruma</i> in this manner, <i>ab initio</i>, <b>because</b> this priest receiving the <i>teruma</i> <b>appears like a priest who assists at the threshing floor,</b> as he presumably agrees to this arrangement in return for some gain.
The Gemara asks: <b>What does Rava maintain? If he maintains</b> that <b>a gift</b> given <b>on the condition that it is returned is called a gift,</b> this should apply not only to <i>teruma</i> but <b>even</b> to <b>all</b> the other cases, i.e., it should be considered a valid gift in all of the above cases. <b>And if he maintains</b> that a gift of this kind <b>is not called a gift,</b> then <b>even</b> with regard to <b><i>teruma</i> it</b> should <b>not</b> be considered a legitimate form of giving.
<b>And furthermore, Rava is the one who says: A gift given on the condition that it is</b> later <b>returned is called a gift. As Rava said</b> that if one says to another on the first day of the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>: <b>Take this <i>etrog</i> on the condition that you return it to me,</b> and the recipient <b>takes it,</b> recites a blessing over it, <b>and returns it, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, despite the fact that one must own the <i>etrog</i> he uses for the mitzva on the first day of <i>Sukkot</i>. <b>And if he does not</b> return it <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation, as he gave him the gift only on the condition that it would be returned. This indicates that in the opinion of Rava, a gift that is given on the condition that it is returned is considered a gift.
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi said: In all of these</b> cases the gift is <b>acquired, except for</b> the betrothal of <b>a woman, because a woman cannot be acquired by</b> means of symbolic <b>exchange. Rav Huna Mar, son of Rav Neḥemya, said to Rav Ashi: We say this in the name of Rava in accordance with your</b> opinion, not in accordance with the previous ruling.
§ <b>Rava says</b> that if a woman said to a man: <b>Give one hundred dinars to so-and-so</b>

Daf 7a

<b>and I will be betrothed to you</b> by means of these one hundred dinars that you give to that individual, <b>she is betrothed,</b> as derived <b>from</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> of <b>a guarantor.</b> How so? With regard to <b>a guarantor,</b> is it <b>not</b> the case that <b>he commits himself</b> to repaying the debt <b>even though he receives no benefit,</b> as the money from the loan is given to the debtor? And with regard to <b>this woman too, even though she receives no benefit,</b> as the one hundred dinars are given to someone else, nevertheless <b>she commits and transfers herself</b> to the man who gives the money.
The Gemara discusses a similar case: If a man gives one hundred dinars to a woman and says to her: <b>Here are one hundred dinars for you, and</b> with this money you <b>become betrothed to so-and-so, she is betrothed,</b> as derived <b>from</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> of emancipating <b>a Canaanite slave.</b> With regard to <b>a Canaanite slave,</b> is it <b>not</b> the case that <b>he acquires himself</b> and is freed when someone gives his master money to emancipate the slave, <b>even though he loses nothing</b> of his own? With regard to <b>this man too,</b> i.e., the third party, <b>even though he loses nothing</b> of his own, <b>he acquires this woman</b> by means of the other man’s payment.
The Gemara discusses a similar case: A woman says to a man: <b>Give one hundred dinars to so-and-so and I will be betrothed to him.</b> If he gives the money, <b>she is betrothed,</b> as is derived <b>from</b> a combination of the <b><i>halakha</i></b> of <b>both of</b> these cases, that of a guarantor and a Canaanite slave. How so? With regard to <b>a guarantor,</b> is it <b>not</b> the case that <b>he commits himself</b> to repaying the debt <b>even though he receives no benefit?</b> With regard to <b>this woman too, even though she receives no benefit,</b> nevertheless <b>she commits and transfers herself.</b>
This consideration alone is insufficient, as one could still ask: <b>Are</b> these cases <b>comparable?</b> In the case of <b>a guarantor, the one who acquires</b> the item in question, which in this case is the commitment of the guarantor, is the one <b>who loses money</b> when he gives the loan. By contrast, in the situation at hand, <b>this man,</b> the third party, <b>acquires the woman and loses nothing</b> of his own. Therefore, the Gemara comments: The emancipating of <b>a Canaanite slave can prove it, as he does not lose</b> his own <b>money and</b> nevertheless <b>he acquires himself.</b>
This consideration alone is insufficient, as one could still ask: <b>Are</b> these cases <b>comparable? There,</b> with regard to a slave, <b>the one who transfers</b> ownership <b>is the one who acquires</b> it, as the master transfers ownership of the slave to the slave, and he himself acquires the money from the donor. <b>Here, this woman transfers herself and she does not acquire anything.</b> Rather, in this regard the case of <b>a guarantor can prove it,</b> as <b>even though he receives no benefit</b> from the creditor, nevertheless, he <b>commits himself,</b> just like the woman in this case. In this manner one can derive that the woman is betrothed in this case from a combination of those two <i>halakhot</i>.
<b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> If a woman said to a man: <b>Here are one hundred dinars and I will be betrothed to you, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Mar Zutra said in the name of Rav Pappa: She is betrothed. Rav Ashi said to Mar Zutra: If so, this is</b> an example of a case in which <b>property that serves as a guarantee is acquired with property that is not guaranteed.</b> Land is property that serves as a guarantee, and, as derived by way of a verbal analogy, the same applies to people. Money is property that does not serve as a guarantee. Through his acquisition of the money, this man acquires the woman as well.
Rav Ashi asks: <b>But we learned the opposite</b> in a mishna (26a): <b>Property that does not serve as a guarantee can be acquired with property that serves as a guarantee through</b> giving <b>money, through</b> giving <b>a document, or through</b> taking <b>possession</b> of them. By contrast, property that serves as a guarantee cannot be acquired by means of acquiring property that does not serve as a guarantee. Mar Zutra <b>said to</b> Rav Ashi: <b>Do you maintain that she</b> wants her acquisition to be performed <b>by means of</b> money, i.e., he will acquire her as well through monetary acquisition? Not so, as <b>here we are dealing with an important man, as, due to the benefit</b> she receives from the fact <b>that he</b> consents to <b>accept a gift from her, she agrees to transfer herself</b> to him.
The Gemara reverts back to the earlier discussion with regard to the derivation from the cases of a guarantor and a Canaanite slave. <b>It was also stated in the name of Rava: And similarly, with regard to monetary matters,</b> one can conduct a valid acquisition in the modes derived from the cases of a guarantor and a Canaanite slave. The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> with regard to both betrothal and monetary acquisitions.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>As, had he taught us</b> only the case of <b>betrothal,</b> one would have said that this <i>halakha</i> applies specifically in that case, <b>because a woman is amenable</b> to be betrothed <b>with any</b> form of benefit, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Reish Lakish. As Reish Lakish said:</b> There is a popular saying among women: <b>It is better to sit</b> as <b>two bodies,</b> i.e., be married, <b>than to sit</b> alone like a <b>widow.</b> A woman prefers any type of husband to being left alone. Consequently, she would be willing to commit herself to betrothal by any form of benefit. <b>But with regard to monetary matters,</b> one might <b>say</b> that these types of unusual acquisitions are <b>not</b> effective.
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if he had taught us</b> only that this is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>monetary matters,</b> one might have said that it applies solely to a case of this kind, <b>because</b> a monetary claim <b>can be waived.</b> One can relinquish his claim to money that is in someone else’s possession without receiving anything in return. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>betrothal,</b> which does not entirely depend on the will and agreement of the woman, as she must actually receive her betrothal money, one might <b>say</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of a guarantor and a Canaanite slave are <b>not</b> comparable to this case. Therefore, <b>it is necessary</b> to state that this is the <i>halakha</i> in both cases.
§ <b>Rava says</b> that if a man says to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to half of me, she is betrothed.</b> But if he said to her: <b>Half of you is betrothed to me, she is not betrothed. Abaye said to Rava: What is different</b> between the two cases <b>that</b> if he says: <b>Half of you is betrothed to me, she is not betrothed?</b> Is it because <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “When a man takes a woman, and marries her” (Deuteronomy 24:1), indicating he must take <b>“a woman,” and not half a woman? So too, the Merciful One states: “A man,” and not half a man.</b>
Rava <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There, a woman is not eligible for two</b> men. If one attempts to betroth half a woman it means he wants to leave her other half for someone else. This is impossible, as a woman cannot be married to two men. <b>But isn’t a man eligible to</b> marry <b>two</b> women? <b>And</b> when he declares: Be betrothed to half of me, <b>this is what he is saying to her: If I wish to marry another</b> woman, <b>I will marry</b> another woman.
<b>Mar Zutra, son of Rav Mari, said to Ravina: But</b> in a case where he says to her: Half of you is betrothed to me, <b>let the betrothal spread through all of her,</b> and she will be completely betrothed. <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Temura</i> 1:5) that if <b>one says</b> about an animal: <b>The leg of this</b> animal <b>is a burnt-offering, all of it is a burnt-offering,</b> as the sanctity of the leg spreads throughout the animal’s entire body?
Mar Zutra adds: <b>And even according to the one who says</b> that <b>it is not entirely a burnt-offering, that statement</b> applies only <b>where he consecrated</b> the leg of the animal, which is <b>not a matter upon which</b> the animal’s <b>life depends.</b> It is possible for an animal to survive the removal of a leg. <b>But</b> if <b>one consecrates a matter upon which</b> the animal’s <b>life depends,</b> everyone agrees that <b>all of it is a burnt-offering.</b> Here too, as the woman cannot survive without half of her body, why doesn’t the betrothal spread throughout all of her?
The Gemara rejects this opinion: <b>Is it comparable? There,</b> in the case of the <b>animal,</b> it involves a creature without intellectual capacity. <b>Here,</b> the issue depends on <b>another mind,</b> that of the woman herself. The woman must indicate that she wants the betrothal to be effective.
<b>This</b> case <b>is comparable only to that</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>which Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>an animal</b> that <b>belongs to two partners,</b> if one of them <b>consecrated</b> the <b>half of it</b> that belonged to him, <b>and</b> he <b>goes back and acquires</b> the other half from his partner <b>and consecrates</b> the other half, it is <b>consecrated,</b> despite the fact that it was consecrated on two separate occasions. <b>But</b> although it is consecrated, <b>it may not be sacrificed,</b> because when he first sanctified it the animal was not fit to be sacrificed. The consecration does not spread throughout the entire animal without the consent of the other partner. This flaw cannot be remedied and the animal is permanently disqualified from being sacrificed as an offering.
<b>But,</b> as it is consecrated now, this is enough to <b>render</b> a non-sacred animal that is exchanged with it <b>a substitute.</b> If one exchanges this animal with another, non-consecrated, animal, the second animal becomes consecrated as well. <b>And</b> yet <b>its substitution is like it,</b> i.e., it too is consecrated but may not be sacrificed either.
The Gemara comments: One can <b>learn from</b> the statement <b>three</b> <i>halakhot</i>.

Daf 7b

<b>Conclude from it that living things can be</b> permanently <b>deferred.</b> Not only an offering that has already been slaughtered, but also a living animal that has been separated as an offering for which it is disqualified, is permanently deferred from being sacrificed on the altar. Likewise here, when he consecrated only half of it, the animal cannot be offered and is rejected. This ruling is in opposition to the claim that only slaughtered animals are permanently rejected.
<b>And</b> furthermore, <b>learn from it that deferral at the outset,</b> i.e., a condition disqualifying the animal from being sacrificed that was present when the animal was first consecrated, <b>is</b> considered a permanent <b>deferral.</b> One does not say that the <i>halakha</i> of deferral applies only to an animal that was eligible to be sacrificed at the time it was consecrated and later was deferred. <b>And learn from it</b> that <b>there is deferral</b> not only with regard to an offering itself, but also <b>with regard to monetary</b> value, i.e., deferral applies even to an animal whose value was consecrated. In this case, half of an animal is not consecrated to be sacrificed as an offering, and yet it can still be permanently deferred from the altar.
§ <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> If a man says to a woman: <b>Half of you</b> is betrothed <b>with half</b> of <b>one <i>peruta</i>, and half of you with half</b> of <b>one <i>peruta</i>, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does one say that <b>since he said to her: Half</b> of <b>one <i>peruta</i>, he has divided</b> his statement? In other words, by specifying half of one <i>peruta</i> he intended the betrothal to be performed in two stages, with one half-<i>peruta</i> for each stage, and half of one <i>peruta</i> does not effect betrothal. <b>Or perhaps he was counting</b> toward the full sum of the betrothal money, and intends for the betrothal to take effect at one time.
And <b>if you say</b> that in that case it is considered as though <b>he were counting,</b> then if he said to her: <b>Half of you</b> is betrothed <b>with one <i>peruta</i> and half of you with one <i>peruta</i>, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does one say that <b>since he said to her: With one <i>peruta</i> and one <i>peruta</i>, he divided his statement</b> and intended to betroth her two halves separately, and one cannot betroth half a woman? <b>Or perhaps anything</b> that he does <b>on</b> that <b>day is</b> considered as if <b>he were counting,</b> i.e., since he intended to complete the action that day it is as though she were betrothed with two <i>perutot</i>.
And <b>if you say</b> that <b>everything</b> he does <b>on</b> that <b>day</b> is considered as if <b>he were counting,</b> then if he said to her: <b>Half of you</b> is betrothed <b>with one <i>peruta</i> today, and half of you</b> is betrothed <b>with one <i>peruta</i> tomorrow, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does one say that <b>since he said to her: Tomorrow,</b> he has <b>divided</b> his statement, which prevents the days from being combined, <b>or perhaps this is what he is saying to her: The betrothal begins from now, and</b> it <b>will not be completed until tomorrow.</b>
Rava further inquires: If he said to her: <b>Your two halves</b> are be-trothed <b>with one <i>peruta</i>, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Here, he certainly spoke to her at one time,</b> i.e., he did not divide his statement into two, and therefore it should be a valid betrothal, <b>or perhaps a woman may not be betrothed in halves at all.</b> No resolution was found for any of these questions, and therefore the Gemara says that the dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rava raises</b> another <b>dilemma.</b> If one man said to another: Let <b>your two daughters</b> be betrothed <b>to my two sons with one <i>peruta</i>, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara explains the two sides of the dilemma: Do <b>we follow the giver and recipient, and</b> as the giver bestows one <i>peruta</i> and the recipient receives one <i>peruta</i> <b>there is money</b> here, since one <i>peruta</i> is considered money and therefore the betrothal is valid. <b>Or perhaps we follow them,</b> i.e., those affected by the issue, in this case the sons and the daughters, <b>and there is not</b> one <i>peruta</i> for each of these individuals, and therefore the betrothal is not valid? This problem is also left unanswered, and therefore the Gemara says that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma:</b> If one man said to another: I hereby acquire <b>your daughter and your cow with one <i>peruta</i>, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that he meant: <b>Your daughter</b> should be betrothed <b>with half</b> of <b>one <i>peruta</i> and your cow</b> purchased <b>with half</b> of <b>one <i>peruta</i>?</b> In that case neither the betrothal nor the acquisition take effect. <b>Or perhaps</b> he meant: <b>Your daughter</b> should be betrothed <b>with one <i>peruta</i> and your cow</b> should be acquired <b>by pulling?</b> No satisfactory answer was found in this case either, and the Gemara says that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rav Ashi raises a dilemma:</b> If he said: I hereby acquire <b>your daughter and your land with one <i>peruta</i>, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does this mean: <b>Your daughter</b> should be betrothed <b>with half</b> of <b>one <i>peruta</i> and your land</b> should be acquired <b>with half</b> of <b>one <i>peruta</i>? Or perhaps</b> it means: <b>Your daughter</b> should be betrothed <b>with one <i>peruta</i> and your land</b> should be acquired <b>through</b> the act of <b>taking possession?</b> This question is also left unanswered, and the Gemara again says that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who betrothed</b> a woman <b>with silk [<i>beshira’ei</i>]</b> garments. <b>Rabba said: An appraisal</b> of the value of the garments is <b>not necessary,</b> as they are certainly worth more than one <i>peruta</i>. <b>Rav Yosef said: An appraisal</b> of the value of the garments is <b>necessary,</b> and as the man did not determine the value of the silk garments before the betrothal, the betrothal is invalid. The Gemara comments: <b>If he said to her</b> that she should become betrothed to him <b>by any amount,</b> regardless of the value of the silk garments, <b>everyone agrees that</b> the garments do <b>not require appraisal,</b> as they are undoubtedly worth more than one <i>peruta</i>.
Conversely, <b>if he said to her</b> that they are worth <b>fifty</b> dinars, <b>and they are not worth fifty</b> dinars, then everyone agrees that the betrothal is not valid, as <b>they are not worth</b> the amount he specified. <b>They disagree when he said</b> that they are worth <b>fifty</b> dinars, <b>and</b> in actuality <b>they are worth fifty</b> dinars. <b>Rabba said: An appraisal</b> of the value of the garments is <b>not necessary</b> before the betrothal, <b>as they are worth fifty</b> dinars. <b>Rav Yosef said: An appraisal</b> of the value of the garments is <b>necessary, because the woman</b> herself <b>is not an expert in appraisal</b> and <b>she does not rely on</b> his assessment. Since she is unsure if the garments are actually worth fifty dinars as he claimed, she does not agree to be betrothed.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>even</b> in a case where he says to her: Be betrothed to me with these silk garments, <b>whatever</b> they are worth, the <i>amora’im</i> <b>disagree</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i>. The reason for the dispute in this case is as follows. <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> An item <b>worth money is like money</b> in every way. <b>Just as money is set,</b> i.e., it has a clearly defined value,

Daf 8a

<b>so too,</b> an item with an item <b>worth money</b> must be <b>set,</b> i.e., it must have a clearly defined value.
<b>Rav Yosef said: From where do I say</b> this opinion? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to redeeming a Hebrew slave: “He shall give back the price of his redemption <b>out of the money that he was bought for”</b> (Leviticus 25:51), which indicates: <b>He is acquired</b> specifically <b>through money and he is not acquired through grain or vessels.</b>
Rav Yosef explains: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>these grains and vessels? If we say that</b> a Hebrew slave <b>cannot be acquired through them at all,</b> as money alone may be used, <b>the Merciful One states: “He shall give back the price of his redemption,”</b> which serves <b>to include</b> all modes of repayment as valid equivalents of money, i.e., an item <b>worth money</b> is the same <b>as money.</b> There is no requirement to use money in particular; it is also possible to use items with monetary value.
<b>And if</b> you say <b>that they do not have the value of one <i>peruta</i>, why</b> mention <b>specifically grain and vessels? Even money</b> that is not worth one <i>peruta</i> cannot be used for acquiring a slave. <b>Rather, is it not</b> speaking here about a case <b>where</b> the grain and vessels <b>do have the value of one <i>peruta</i>, but since they lack a set</b> value, <b>no,</b> a Hebrew slave cannot be redeemed with them? The comparison with money teaches that a Hebrew slave can be redeemed only with an item that has a clearly defined value, like money.
<b>And the other</b> Sage, Rabba, who maintains that appraisal is not necessary, would respond: The <i>tanna</i> is referring to an item worth one <i>peruta</i>, but he is not teaching that one cannot redeem a slave with items whose value is not set. Rather, <b>this is what he is saying:</b> A Hebrew slave <b>is acquired through the mode of money, and he is not acquired through the mode of grain or vessels. And what is this</b> mode particular to the acquisition of grain and vessels? This is referring to symbolic <b>exchange.</b> A slave cannot be acquired through the mode of acquisition of symbolic exchange.
The Gemara notes: This explanation is valid only according to those who say that grain can be acquired through the mode of exchange; <b>but according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman, who said</b> that <b>produce cannot effect</b> symbolic <b>exchange,</b> as this mode of acquisition applies only to vessels, <b>what can be said?</b> Why does the <i>tanna</i> mention grain if grain cannot be used in symbolic exchange? <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects this explanation in favor of the following: <b>Actually,</b> this is referring to a case where the grain and utensils <b>do not have the value of one <i>peruta</i>. And as for that which you said: Why</b> mention <b>specifically grain and vessels; even money</b> that is not worth one <i>peruta</i> cannot acquire <b>either,</b> one could say that the <i>tanna</i> <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>It is not necessary</b> to state with regard to <b>money that if it has the value of one <i>peruta</i>, yes,</b> one effects acquisition with it, and <b>if not,</b> then <b>no,</b> one cannot effect acquisition with it. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>grain and vessels,</b> one might <b>say that</b> as <b>their benefit is</b> readily <b>available,</b> i.e., one can enjoy them immediately in their current state, perhaps the slave <b>decides and transfers</b> ownership of <b>himself</b> to the master by even less than the worth of one <i>peruta</i>. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that an article less than the value of one <i>peruta</i> cannot effect acquisition notwithstanding the above reasoning.
<b>Rav Yosef said: From where do I say</b> that betrothal can be effected only with an item with a clearly defined value? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bekhorot</i> 6:4), that if one says to a priest: <b>This calf</b> should be <b>for the redemption of my</b> firstborn <b>son,</b> or: <b>This cloak</b> should be <b>for the redemption of my</b> firstborn <b>son,</b> then <b>he has said nothing.</b> But if he said: <b>This calf</b> worth the value <b>of five <i>sela</i></b> should be <b>for the redemption of my</b> firstborn <b>son,</b> or: <b>This cloak</b> worth the value <b>of five <i>sela</i></b> should be <b>for the redemption of my</b> firstborn <b>son,</b> then <b>his son is redeemed.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> with regard to <b>this redemption</b> with a calf or a cloak that has no clearly defined value? <b>If we say that they are not worth</b> five <i>sela</i>, <b>is it in his</b> power to give a priest less than the established amount? Why would it even be considered that perhaps the son is redeemed? <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case where <b>even though they are worth</b> this amount, one <b>may not</b> redeem with them in the case of the first clause <b>since their value is not set?</b> This shows that there is a difference between an item that has a set value and one that does not.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No; actually,</b> this is referring to a case <b>where</b> the calf or cloak <b>is not worth</b> five <i>sela</i>, <b>and</b> the latter clause is referring to a case <b>where the priest accepted upon himself</b> to value the items as though they were worth this amount, which is why the son is redeemed. <b>This is like this</b> incident in <b>which Rav Kahana,</b> who was a priest, <b>took a cloth [<i>sudara</i>] from the house</b> of a man obligated to perform <b>the redemption of</b> his firstborn <b>son.</b> Rav Kahana <b>said to</b> the man: <b>For me, I view</b> this cloth as though it were worth <b>five <i>sela</i>.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi said: We said</b> that it is possible to redeem one’s son in this manner <b>only</b> when the priest is an individual <b>such as Rav Kahana, who is a great man and is required</b> to wear <b>a cloth on his head.</b> It was common practice for important people to wear a scarf on their heads. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>everyone</b> else, i.e., those who do not wear these cloths and cannot say it is worth that amount to them, <b>no,</b> they may not perform the redemption of the firstborn son in this manner. The Gemara cites a proof that a distinguished individual who needs a cloth will pay a large amount for one. <b>This is like this</b> incident in <b>which Mar bar Rav Ashi bought a cloth from Rabba’s mother from Kovei for thirteen</b> dinars, despite the fact that it was <b>worth ten,</b> because he needed a cloth.
§ <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> If a man said to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with one hundred dinars, and he gave her</b> one <b>dinar</b> out of the one hundred, <b>she is betrothed</b> immediately <b>and he must</b> subsequently <b>complete</b> the payment of the remainder of the amount he promised her. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Since he said to her:</b> Be betrothed to me with <b>one hundred dinars, and</b> yet <b>he gave her</b> only one <b>dinar, he is like one who said to her:</b> Be betrothed to me <b>on the condition</b> that I will give you one hundred dinars. In other words, he betroths her now with one dinar on the condition he will pay the remaining ninety-nine in the future. The betrothal therefore takes effect immediately, and he owes her the rest of the one hundred dinars.
The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> this is in accordance with the opinion that <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who states</b> a provision employing the phrase: <b>On the condition, it is</b> tantamount to his <b>stipulating</b> that the agreement take effect retroactively <b>from now.</b> An agreement stipulated by means of the phrase: On the condition, takes effect immediately. This is not like an ordinary agreement, which takes effect only after the condition has been fulfilled.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:10). If a man says to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with one hundred dinars, and</b> while <b>he was counting</b> the money, <b>one of them wanted to retract</b> the betrothal, <b>it is in the power</b> of either of them to do so <b>even when</b> only <b>the last</b> dinar remains to be given. This indicates that the betrothal does not take effect until the entire one hundred dinars has been paid.
The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> This is a case <b>where he says</b> to the woman: Be betrothed to me <b>with this one hundred dinars.</b> In this case the entire one hundred dinars, not just the first dinar, constitutes the betrothal money. The Gemara raises a difficulty with this answer: <b>From</b> the fact that <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> uses the expression: <b>With this one hundred dinars,</b> it can be inferred that <b>the first clause</b> is dealing with <b>an unspecified one hundred dinars.</b>
<b>As it is taught in the latter clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i>, if <b>he said</b> to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with this one hundred dinars, and it was found to be one hundred dinars less a dinar, or</b> if it included <b>a dinar of copper</b> instead of silver, <b>she is not betrothed.</b> If one of the dinars was found to be <b>a flawed dinar,</b> i.e., it was a silver dinar but it was so worn that it would not be universally accepted, <b>she is betrothed, and he must exchange</b> that dinar for a different one. Since the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i> emphasizes the term: This one hundred dinars, evidently the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> must be referring to an unspecified one hundred dinars.
The Gemara rejects this opinion: <b>No;</b> one can say that the <b>first clause and the latter clause</b> are both referring to a case <b>where he said: With this one hundred dinars, and</b> the latter clause <b>is explaining</b> the first clause, as follows: If <b>one of them wishes to retract the</b> betrothal, <b>it is in the power</b> of either of them to do so <b>even when</b> only <b>the last</b> dinar remains to be given. <b>How so?</b> This is referring to a case <b>where he said to her: With this one hundred dinars.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And so too, it is reasonable</b> to explain the <i>baraita</i> this way, <b>as, if it enters your mind</b> that <b>the first clause</b> is referring <b>to an unspecified one hundred dinars,</b> consider the following: <b>Now</b> if <b>it is not a betrothal in</b> a case involving <b>an unspecified one hundred dinars,</b> and she can retract her agreement to the betrothal, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to say that she can retract it when he says: <b>With this one hundred dinars?</b> If that were the correct interpretation of the first clause, the ruling in the last clause would be unnecessary.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>If it is due to that</b> reason, <b>there is no</b> conclusive <b>argument,</b> i.e., the proof of the argument is inconclusive. The reason is that one could say that the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught the latter clause to reveal</b> the meaning of <b>the first clause.</b> The function of the latter clause is not to teach a novel <i>halakha</i>, but to preempt a mistaken reading of the first clause. The latter clause was stated so <b>that you should not</b> mistakenly <b>say that the first clause</b> is referring only to a situation when he said: <b>With this one hundred dinars, but in</b> a case of <b>an unspecified one hundred dinars, it</b> would be <b>a betrothal.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in <b>the latter clause: With this one hundred dinars,</b> which teaches <b>by inference that the first clause</b> is referring <b>to an unspecified one hundred dinars, and even so it is not a betrothal.</b> Although this proof is rejected, the Gemara remains with its explanation that the first clause is referring to a case where he said to her: With this one hundred dinars.
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> It is unnecessary to explain that the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where he said: With this one hundred dinars, as a situation where he <b>was counting</b> the money <b>is different.</b> The reason is <b>that she has the entirety</b> of the one hundred dinars <b>in mind,</b> and therefore she will not be content with some of the money. His continuous action indicates that they both expect that he will give her the entire one hundred dinars, and consequently both parties can retract their agreement until he finishes counting.
The Gemara further analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What are the circumstances of this copper dinar</b> mentioned here? <b>If she knows that it</b> is a copper dinar, <b>she knew and accepted</b> this coin as a dinar. If so, she cannot later retract her betrothal. The Gemara answers: <b>No;</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where he gave her</b> this dinar <b>at night</b> and at the time she did not see that it was copper. <b>Alternatively, it was found among</b> the other <b>dinars,</b> and she did not notice that one of them one was copper.
The Gemara further asks: <b>What are the circumstances of this flawed dinar,</b> also mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>? <b>If it cannot be spent,</b> i.e., it cannot pass as a silver dinar, <b>this is</b> exactly like <b>a copper dinar,</b> as it too is not worth a full dinar. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> This is referring to a case <b>where</b> the dinar <b>can be spent with difficulty,</b> i.e., it is difficult, but not impossible, to find someone who will accept it.
§ <b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> If <b>one said to</b> a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with one hundred dinars, and</b> instead of giving it to her <b>he gave her collateral for</b> the money, <b>she is not betrothed.</b>

Daf 8b

<b>There is no one hundred dinars here,</b> as he has not yet given her one hundred dinars, and <b>there is no collateral here,</b> since this collateral is not a gift but merely a security. He has therefore not given her anything. <b>Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: If <b>he betrothed her with collateral, she is betrothed.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> it is referring <b>to collateral</b> belonging <b>to other</b> people, which was in the possession of the man who betrothed her, <b>and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak.</b>
<b>As Rabbi Yitzḥak says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a creditor acquires collateral,</b> i.e., that the individual in possession of the collateral has the actual rights to it? <b>As it is stated:</b> “You shall surely restore him the pledge when the sun goes down that he may sleep in his garment, and bless you; <b>and it shall be righteousness to you”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:13). <b>If</b> the creditor <b>does not acquire</b> the pledge or collateral, <b>from where</b> does this considering his return of the collateral as <b>righteousness</b> stem? The creditor is not giving an item belonging to him; why is this considered a righteous act? Rather, <b>from here</b> it is derived <b>that a creditor acquires collateral</b> to a certain extent.
The Gemara relates: <b>The sons of Rav Huna bar Avin bought a certain maidservant</b> on the condition that they would pay <b>with</b> copper <b><i>perutot</i>. They did not have</b> the money at the time, and therefore <b>they gave a piece of silver [<i>naskha</i>] for her</b> as collateral. <b>Ultimately,</b> the price of the <b>maidservant increased</b> and the sellers wanted to cancel the sale. <b>They came before Rabbi Ami</b> for his ruling and <b>he said to them: There are no <i>perutot</i> here,</b> and <b>there is no piece of silver here</b> either. There was no valid act of acquisition at all because they did not actually give the money, and the collateral does not transfer ownership.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:9): If a man said to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with one hundred dinars,</b> and <b>she took it</b> from his hand <b>and threw it into the sea, or into the fire, or into anything that destroys, she is not betrothed.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise at this ruling: The <i>baraita</i> indicates that she is not betrothed only if the one hundred dinars are destroyed, <b>but</b> if she <b>threw the coins before him</b> but did not destroy them, <b>that is a betrothal.</b> Why should this be? By throwing the coins at him <b>she is</b> effectively <b>saying to him: Take</b> this; <b>I do not want</b> your betrothal.
The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is speaking</b> using the style of: <b>It is not necessary,</b> as follows: <b>It is not necessary</b> to state in a case where <b>she throws</b> the money <b>before him that it is not a betrothal,</b> as her action indicates that she does not want to be betrothed. <b>But</b> when <b>she throws it into the sea or into the fire,</b> one might <b>say</b> that <b>since she is obligated</b> to pay <b>for</b> the money he gave her, perhaps <b>she betrothed herself</b> with the money she received. <b>And as</b> for the reason why <b>she did this</b> act of destroying the money, <b>she thought: I will test this man</b> to see <b>if he is</b> an individual of <b>an angry</b> temperament <b>or not.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that even in that case it is not a betrothal.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:9): If a man said to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with one hundred dinars,</b> and she said to him: <b>Give</b> the money <b>to</b> my <b>father,</b> or: Give the money <b>to your father, she is not betrothed.</b> If she said: Give the money to my father, or Give the money to your father <b>on the condition that he accepts them for me, she is betrothed.</b>
The Gemara comments: The <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> the case where she said: Give the money to my <b>father, to convey the far-reaching nature of</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the first clause.</b> If she simply said that he should give the money to anybody else, even her own father, whom it can be assumed she wants to benefit, she is still not betrothed. And the <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> the case where she said: Give the money to <b>your father, to convey the far-reaching nature of</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the latter clause.</b> If she said that someone else should receive the money on her behalf, it is a valid betrothal even if she said the money should be given to his father.
The Gemara cites a similar case. If he said to her: <b>Be betrothed to me with one hundred dinars,</b> and she said to him: <b>Give them to so-and-so, she is not betrothed.</b> But if she said to him: <b>On the condition that he accepts them for me, she is betrothed.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>It is necessary</b> to issue this ruling, despite the fact that it is apparently identical to the previous <i>halakha</i>.
The Gemara elaborates: This is <b>because if</b> the <i>tanna</i> had <b>taught us</b> only the case where she said: <b>Give</b> the money <b>to</b> my <b>father,</b> or: Give the money <b>to your father,</b> one would say that <b>it is</b> in that case <b>there, when she said: On the condition that</b> one of these relatives <b>accepts them for me,</b> that <b>it is a betrothal, as she relies on them</b> and she <b>thinks: They will do my bidding for me</b> and will hold this money on my behalf. <b>But</b> if she says: Give it to <b>so-and-so,</b> someone who is not related to either of them, <b>no,</b> the betrothal is not valid.
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if</b> the <i>tanna</i> had <b>taught us</b> only the case of <b>so-and-so,</b> one might say: <b>It is here, when she said: Give it to so-and-so,</b> that <b>it is not a betrothal,</b> as <b>she is not close to him</b> and is not interested in <b>giving him</b> this money <b>as a gift. But</b> if she said: <b>Give</b> the money <b>to</b> my <b>father,</b> or: Give the money <b>to your father, to whom she is close,</b> one might <b>say</b> that <b>she gave it to them as a gift,</b> i.e., she accepted the sum as her betrothal money and decided to give it as a gift. If so, she should be betrothed. <b>It was</b> therefore <b>necessary</b> for the <i>tanna</i> to issue both rulings and clarify that she is not betrothed in either case.
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If a man said to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with one hundred dinars,</b> and she said to him: <b>Place them on a rock, she is not betrothed. And if</b> the <b>rock was hers, she is betrothed. Rav Beivai raises a dilemma:</b> If the <b>rock was</b> the property <b>of both of them, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? No answer was found, and the Gemara states that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
The Gemara discusses a similar case. If a man said to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with a loaf</b> of bread, and she said to him: <b>Give it to a dog, she is not betrothed. And if</b> this <b>dog was hers, she is betrothed. Rav Mari raises a dilemma:</b> If <b>a dog</b> was <b>chasing her</b> to bite her, and she said to him: Give the loaf to the dog, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
The Gemara presents the two sides of the dilemma: Does one say that <b>she commits herself</b> to betrothal <b>and transfers herself</b> to him <b>through this benefit that</b> she receives <b>by being rescued</b> from the dog? <b>Or perhaps she can say to him: By Torah law you are required to rescue me,</b> due to the injunction: “Neither shall you stand idly by the blood of your neighbor” (Leviticus 19:16), and therefore she is not betrothed with the loaf because she does not owe him anything. This problem is also left unanswered, and the Gemara again states that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
If a man said to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with a loaf</b> of bread, and she said: <b>Give it to a poor person, she is not betrothed, even</b> if it was <b>a poor person who is dependent upon her,</b> i.e., a poor person who regularly receives food from that woman. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? She could <b>say to him: Just as I am required</b> to give charity to <b>him, so too you are required</b> to give charity to <b>him.</b> Therefore, this donation is not an indication that she has agreed to the betrothal.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who was selling</b>

Daf 9a

<b>beads [<i>ḥumrei</i>]of glass [<i>petakhyata</i>]. A certain woman came</b> and <b>said to him: Give me one string. He said to her: If I give you</b> this string <b>will you be betrothed to me</b> with it? <b>She said to him: Give, give. Rav Ḥama said: Any</b> use of the expression: <b>Give, give, is nothing.</b> Although she said: Give, give, she did not agree to the condition, as she was mocking him and had no intention of actually becoming betrothed.
The Gemara relates a similar incident: There was <b>a certain man who was drinking wine in a store. A woman came</b> in and <b>said to him: Give me one cup</b> of wine. <b>He said to her: If I give you</b> a cup of wine will <b>you be betrothed to me</b> with it? <b>She said to him: Give to drink, give</b> it <b>to me to drink. Rav Ḥama said</b> that <b>any</b> use of the expression: <b>Give to drink, give</b> it <b>to me to drink, is nothing,</b> i.e., she certainly did not intend to accept the condition and she is not betrothed.
The Gemara further relates: There was <b>a certain man who was picking dates from a date tree. A certain woman came</b> and <b>said to him: Throw me two. He said to her: If I throw</b> two dates <b>to you</b> will <b>you be betrothed to me</b> with them? <b>She said to him: Throw, throw. Rav Zevid said: Any use</b> of the expression: <b>Throw, throw, is nothing,</b> and she is not betrothed.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If she said: <b>Give,</b> or: <b>Give to drink,</b> or: <b>Throw,</b> without the additional emphasis of the repetition, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does this straightforward statement indicate that she actually meant him to give it to her in accordance with his stated condition, or does she not agree to betrothal even here? <b>Ravina said: She is betrothed. Rav Sama bar Rakta said</b> in the form of an oath: <b>By the king’s crown! She is not betrothed.</b> The Gemara states: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>she is not betrothed.</b>
The Gemara issues further rulings concerning the previous cases. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is: With regard to <b>silk</b> garments that are worth more than one <i>peruta</i>, <b>appraisal</b> is <b>not necessary</b> before a woman can be betrothed with them. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> that if a man promised a woman one hundred dinars as betrothal money and gave her only a dinar, she is betrothed. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rava,</b> who said that <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that if he promised one hundred dinars and gave her only collateral, this is not a valid betrothal.
§ <b>The Sages taught: How is</b> betrothal performed <b>with a document?</b> If he <b>wrote</b> the following <b>for</b> a young woman’s father <b>on paper or earthenware, despite</b> the fact <b>that</b> the paper or earthenware <b>is not worth one <i>peruta</i>: Your daughter is betrothed [<i>mekuddeshet</i>] to me,</b> or: <b>Your daughter is betrothed [<i>me’oreset</i>] to me,</b> or: <b>Your daughter is to me as a wife,</b> then <b>she is betrothed.</b> There is no requirement for the paper or earthenware to be worth one <i>peruta</i>, as she is not betrothed through the value of the paper or earthenware.
<b>Rabbi Zeira bar Memel objects to this</b> description of the writing of the document: <b>But this document is not comparable to a bill of sale. There,</b> in the case of a bill of sale, the <b>seller</b> is the one who <b>writes to</b> the buyer: <b>My field is sold to you. Here,</b> the <b>husband,</b> who is akin to a buyer, is the one who <b>writes: Your daughter is betrothed to me.</b>
<b>Rava said: There,</b> in the case of a sale, the formulation of the document is taken <b>from the context of the verse, and here,</b> in the case of betrothal, the formulation of the document is likewise taken <b>from the context of the verse.</b> Rava elaborates: <b>There,</b> with regard to a sale, <b>it is written: “And sells of his ancestral land”</b> (Leviticus 25:25), which indicates that <b>the Merciful One renders</b> the transaction <b>dependent on the seller. Here, it is written: “If</b> a man <b>takes</b> a woman” (Deuteronomy 22:13), meaning that <b>the Merciful One renders</b> the betrothal <b>dependent on the husband.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>There,</b> in the case of a sale, <b>it is also written: “Men shall buy [<i>yiknu</i>] fields for money”</b> (Jeremiah 32:44), which indicates that the matter depends upon the buyer. The Gemara answers: <b>Read into</b> the verse: Shall sell <b>[<i>yikkanu</i>].</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>you read it</b> as <b><i>yikkanu</i>; because it is written</b> in the verse in Leviticus: <b>“And sells,”</b> and there is a preference to have the verse from the Prophets accord with that of the Torah? <b>So too,</b> instead of: “If a man takes [<i>ki yikaḥ</i>]” (Deuteronomy 22:13), <b>read into</b> the verse: When he is given <b>[<i>ki yakiaḥ</i>], as it is written: “I gave my daughter to this man”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:16), so that the verses will accord with each other.
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> There is no proof from the verses for these rulings, as <b>they are a <i>halakha</i></b> received through tradition, <b>and the Sages based them on</b> the <b>verses. And if you wish, say: There too,</b> in the case in Jeremiah, <b>it is written</b> with regard to the buyer: <b>“And I took the deed of purchase”</b> (Jeremiah 32:11), thereby indicating that it is the seller who writes the document.
<b>And Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> If he <b>wrote</b> the following <b>for him on paper or earthenware, despite</b> the fact <b>that</b> the paper or earthenware <b>is not worth one <i>peruta</i>: Your daughter is betrothed [<i>mekuddeshet</i>] to me,</b> or: <b>Your daughter is betrothed [<i>me’oreset</i>] to me,</b> or: <b>Your daughter is to me as a wife, whether</b> he gave it <b>to her father or whether</b> he gave it directly <b>to her, she is betrothed with the consent</b> of her father. <b>And this</b> is the <i>halakha</i> provided <b>that she has not</b> yet <b>reached her majority,</b> before which her father alone has the authority to betroth her.
<b>If he wrote for her on paper or earthenware, despite</b> the fact <b>that</b> the paper or earthenware <b>is not worth one <i>peruta</i>: You are hereby betrothed [<i>mekuddeshet</i>] to me,</b> or: <b>You are hereby to me as a wife,</b> or: <b>You are hereby betrothed [<i>me’oreset</i>] to me,</b> then <b>she is betrothed whether</b> he gave it <b>to her father</b> or <b>to her,</b> as long as this was <b>with her consent. And this is</b> the <i>halakha</i> provided <b>that she has reached her majority</b> and is under her own authority.
§ <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a document of betrothal that was written not for her sake,</b> i.e., not for this particular woman, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do <b>we juxtapose</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the <b>modes of becoming</b> betrothed <b>to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the <b>modes of leaving</b> a marriage, i.e., divorce? If so, one should say: <b>Just as</b>

Daf 9b

<b>we require</b> that the document of <b>leaving,</b> i.e., a bill of divorce, must be written specifically <b>for her sake, so too, we require</b> that the document of <b>becoming</b> betrothed be written <b>for her sake. Or perhaps we juxtapose</b> the different <b>modes of becoming</b> betrothed <b>to each other</b> and say: <b>Just as we do not require</b> that <b>becoming</b> betrothed <b>with money</b> must be carried out with coins minted <b>for her sake, so too, we do not require</b> that <b>becoming</b> betrothed <b>with a document</b> must be with a document written <b>for her sake.</b>
<b>After he raised the dilemma,</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish <b>then resolved it. We juxtapose becoming</b> betrothed <b>to leaving</b> a marriage, <b>as the verse states: “And she departs</b> out of his house, and goes <b>and becomes”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:2). This shows that the <i>halakhot</i> of a betrothal document are derived from those of a bill of divorce, and therefore a document of betrothal must also be written for her sake.
<b>It was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to the following issue: If a man <b>wrote</b> a document of betrothal <b>for her sake but without her consent,</b> i.e., she did not know at the time that they were writing it but accepted it afterward, <b>Rava and Ravina say: She is betrothed. Rav Pappa and Rav Sherevya say: She is not betrothed. Rav Pappa said: I will say their reason and I will say my reason. I will state their reason, as it is written: “And she departs</b> out of his house, and goes <b>and becomes,”</b> by which the verse <b>juxtaposes becoming</b> betrothed <b>to leaving</b> a marriage. <b>Just as</b> a bill of divorce, written for <b>leaving</b> a marriage must be written <b>for her own sake but</b> can be written <b>without her consent, so too,</b> a document written for <b>becoming</b> betrothed must be written <b>for her own sake and</b> can even be <b>without her consent.</b>
<b>And I will say my reason:</b> The verse says: <b>“And she departs</b> out of his house, and goes <b>and becomes.”</b> The verse <b>juxtaposes becoming</b> betrothed <b>to leaving</b> a marriage. <b>Just as</b> with regard to a bill of divorce, written for <b>leaving</b> a marriage, <b>we require the consent of the one transferring</b> ownership, i.e., the man, as he divorces and transfers authority of the woman to herself, <b>so too,</b> with regard to a document written for <b>becoming</b> betrothed, <b>we require the consent of the one transferring</b> ownership, which in this case is the woman, who must agree to the marriage.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 167b) against the opinion that she is betrothed if the document was written without her consent. <b>One writes documents of betrothal and marriage only with the consent of both</b> the man and woman. <b>What, is</b> the mishna <b>not</b> referring to <b>actual documents of betrothal and marriage,</b> which indicates that the document must be written with the woman’s consent? The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No,</b> this is referring to <b>documents of stipulation,</b> which contain the details of the dowry. <b>And</b> this statement is <b>in accordance with</b> that which <b>Rav Giddel</b> says that <b>Rav says.</b>
<b>As Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If the father of one member of the couple says to the father of the other: <b>How much are you giving to your son?</b> And he answers: <b>Such and such,</b> and adds: How much are you giving <b>to your daughter?</b> And the other responds: <b>Such and such,</b> then if <b>they,</b> the couple, subsequently <b>arose and</b> became <b>betrothed, they acquire</b> everything that was promised. <b>These are the matters that are acquired through speech,</b> and they do not require an act of acquisition. The documents of betrothal mentioned here that require the woman’s consent are those which contain this type of monetary obligation, not actual documents of betrothal.
§ The mishna teaches that a woman can be betrothed <b>through sexual intercourse.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that <b>the verse states:</b> “If a man be found lying with <b>a married woman [<i>beulat ba’al</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:22). This <b>teaches that he becomes her husband [<i>ba’al</i>] by means of sexual intercourse [<i>be’ila</i>]. Rabbi Zeira said to Rabbi Abbahu, and some say</b> it was <b>Reish Lakish</b> who said this <b>to Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> Is <b>this</b> other proof, <b>taught by Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>unacceptable:</b> “When a man takes a woman <b>and engages in sexual intercourse with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1)? This verse <b>teaches</b> that <b>she can be acquired through intercourse.</b>
The Gemara answers that the verse cited by Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi is insufficient proof that a woman can be betrothed via intercourse, as, <b>if</b> this <i>halakha</i> were derived only <b>from there, I would say</b> that she is not considered his wife <b>unless he</b> first <b>betroths</b> her through money, indicated by the phrase “takes a woman,” <b>and then engages in intercourse</b> with her. This is the only valid mode of betrothal, and intercourse alone is not enough. Therefore, the verse states “a married woman [<i>beulat ba’al</i>]” and <b>teaches us</b> that intercourse by itself is a valid means of betrothal.
<b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel objects to this:</b> The above suggestion, that both money and sexual intercourse are required for betrothal, cannot be the correct interpretation of the verse: “When a man takes a woman and engages in sexual intercourse with her.” This is because, <b>if</b> it is <b>so,</b> that a woman can be acquired only through both betrothal money and intercourse, the case of one who engages in intercourse with <b>a betrothed young woman,</b> concerning which <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah that he is punished <b>by stoning</b> (see Deuteronomy 22:23–24)<b>, how can you find</b> a case where he is liable to be punished in this manner?
Rabbi Abba bar Memel elaborates: <b>If</b> this is referring to a case <b>where he betrothed</b> her with money <b>and then engaged in sexual intercourse</b> with her, <b>she is a non-virgin,</b> and the punishment of stoning applies only to one who engages in intercourse with a betrothed young virgin. <b>If</b> it is referring to a case <b>where he betrothed</b> her with money <b>and did not engage in intercourse</b> with her, this <b>is nothing,</b> as the betrothal has not been completed. <b>The Rabbis said before Abaye: You find it</b> in a case <b>where</b> he betrothed her with money and then the <b>betrothed man engaged in intercourse with her in an atypical manner,</b> i.e., anal intercourse. Despite the fact that she is still a virgin, the betrothal has taken effect by means of this type of sexual intercourse.
<b>Abaye said to</b> those Sages: The verse cannot be explained in that manner, as <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and the Rabbis disagree only with regard to another</b> man, i.e., whether a woman is considered to be a virgin after engaging in anal intercourse with another man. <b>But</b> with regard to her <b>husband, everyone agrees</b> that <b>if he engages in intercourse in an atypical manner with her he has rendered her a non-virgin.</b> If so, she is no longer considered a virgin with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of a betrothed young woman.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is</b> the dispute to which Abaye refers? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 10:4): If <b>ten men engaged in sexual intercourse with</b> a betrothed young woman, <b>and she is still a virgin,</b> as they engaged in anal intercourse with her, <b>they are all</b> punished <b>by stoning. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say</b> that <b>the first</b> one is punished <b>by stoning,</b> as he engaged in intercourse with a virgin young woman, <b>but all</b> the others are punished <b>by strangulation.</b> Once the first man engages in intercourse with her she is no longer considered a virgin, even if he engaged in anal intercourse with her.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> a different answer to Rabbi Abba bar Memel’s question: <b>You find</b> a situation where a man who engages in intercourse with a betrothed young woman is punished by stoning in a case <b>where he betrothed her with a document.</b> Everyone agrees that <b>since</b> a document, i.e., a bill of divorce, <b>completely removes</b> a woman from her husband, without the need for an additional act, it also <b>completely brings</b> her into the state of betrothal. If a young woman is betrothed by means of a document, she can be a betrothed young woman while remaining a virgin.
The Gemara returns to the different derivations of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabbi Yoḥanan. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who maintains that the mode of betrothal through intercourse is derived from the verse: “If a man be found lying with a married woman [<i>beulat ba’al</i>]” (Deuteronomy 22:22), what does he <b>do with this</b> verse: “When a man takes a woman <b>and engages in sexual intercourse with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1)? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires that</b> verse for a different <i>halakha</i>, as he maintains that it teaches that <b>this</b> woman <b>can be acquired through intercourse, but a Hebrew maidservant cannot be acquired through intercourse.</b>
As it might <b>enter your mind to say: Let</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a Hebrew maidservant <b>be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a <i>yevama</i>: Just as a <i>yevama</i>, who cannot be acquired through money</b> at all, nevertheless <b>can be acquired through intercourse,</b> which indicates that the ability of an act of sexual intercourse to effect acquisition is greater than that of money, <b>is it not logical that this</b> Hebrew maidservant, <b>who can be acquired through money, can</b> also <b>be acquired through intercourse?</b>
The Gemara rejects this opinion: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about a <i>yevama</i> is that she is bound and standing</b> waiting for the <i>yavam</i>, i.e., there is already a connection between them. Perhaps it is for this reason that intercourse enables a <i>yavam</i> to acquire a <i>yevama</i>, and the same cannot be said of a maidservant. Rather, it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> a different claim: <b>Since it is written</b> with regard to a the master of a Hebrew maidservant: <b>“If he take himself another</b> wife” (Exodus 21:10), this <b>verse juxtaposes</b> a Hebrew maidservant <b>with another</b> woman that a master marries: <b>Just as another</b> woman that a master marries <b>can be acquired through intercourse, so too, a Hebrew maidservant can be acquired through intercourse. Therefore,</b> the verse <b>teaches us,</b> with the phrase “and engages in sexual intercourse with her,” that this is not the case.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who learns that betrothal can be effected through sexual intercourse from this verse, <b>from where does he</b> derive <b>this conclusion</b> that a Hebrew maidservant cannot be acquired through intercourse? The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> that this verse is teaching only one <i>halakha</i>, <b>let the Merciful One write</b> simply: <b>And he engages in sexual intercourse. What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“And he engages in sexual intercourse with her”? Learn two</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>from it.</b> One can learn from this verse both that a woman can be acquired through intercourse, and that an ordinary woman can be betrothed through intercourse but a Hebrew maidservant cannot be acquired through intercourse.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava, who said: Bar Ahina explained this to me</b> by citing a proof from the following verse: <b>“When a man takes a woman and engages in sexual intercourse with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), which teaches that <b>betrothal that is given to consummation,</b> i.e., betrothal when it is permitted for the man and woman to engage in intercourse, <b>is a betrothal,</b> but <b>betrothal that is not given to consummation is not</b> a valid <b>betrothal, what is there to say?</b> Since he uses this verse for a different purpose, from where does Rava derive that a woman can be betrothed through intercourse and that a Hebrew maidservant cannot be acquired in this manner?
The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> that a woman cannot be betrothed through intercourse, <b>let the verse write:</b> When a man takes a woman <b>or engages in intercourse with her. What is</b> indicated by the phrase: <b>“And engages in sexual intercourse with her”?</b> One can <b>learn from</b> the verse <b>all</b> these <i>halakhot</i>, that intercourse is a valid mode of betrothing a woman but not acquiring a maidservant, and betrothal is effective only when it is given to consummation.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>what does he do with this</b> verse: “If a man be found lying with <b>a married woman [<i>beulat ba’al</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:22), from which Rabbi Yoḥanan derives that intercourse is a valid means of betrothal? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>requires this</b> verse for the <i>halakha</i> that <b>the husband renders her a non-virgin</b> even if he engages <b>in intercourse</b> with her <b>in an atypical manner, but no other</b> man <b>renders her a non-virgin</b> by engaging <b>in intercourse</b> with her <b>in an atypical manner.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>accept this opinion? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>ten men engaged in intercourse with</b> a betrothed young woman, <b>and she is still a virgin, they are all</b> punished <b>by stoning. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say</b> that <b>the first</b> one is punished <b>by stoning, but</b> the others are <b>all</b> punished <b>by strangulation.</b> This proves that in the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, even one who is not her husband can render a woman a non-virgin by engaging in anal intercourse with her.

Daf 10a

<b>Rabbi Zeira said: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>concedes with regard to</b> the <b>fine</b> of a rapist and a seducer <b>that they all pay</b> this fine, and they are not exempt merely because their acts of intercourse were with a non-virgin. The Gemara asks: In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> the <b>death</b> penalty? With respect to the death penalty they are punished as though they engaged in intercourse with a betrothed non-virgin, and yet concerning the fine, they pay as though they engaged in intercourse with a virgin. The Gemara answers: It <b>is different there,</b> with regard to capital punishment, <b>as the verse states: “Then the man only who lay with her shall die”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:25), which indicates that only one man is executed for having sexual intercourse with a virgin, and no more.
The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis, what do they do with this</b> term <b>“only”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>They require it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. The verse states: <b>“Then they shall both of them die”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:22). This indicates that this is not the case <b>unless</b> the two of them <b>are equal,</b> i.e., both deserve punishment. But if one of them cannot be punished, e.g., if he is a minor, the other is not executed either. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Oshaya. Rabbi Yonatan says</b> that the verse: <b>“Then the man only who lay with her shall die,”</b> indicates that in some cases only one of them is liable to receive the death penalty.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan, from where does he</b> derive <b>this conclusion</b> that only a woman’s husband can render her a non-virgin through intercourse in an atypical manner, if he uses this verse to derive the mode of betrothal by means of sexual intercourse? The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> that this verse is teaching only one <i>halakha</i>, <b>let the verse write:</b> If a man be found lying with <b>a <i>beulat ish</i>,</b> literally, a woman who engaged in sexual intercourse with a man. <b>What</b> is indicated by the term <b>“<i>beulat ba’al</i>,”</b> literally, who engaged in sexual intercourse with a husband? <b>Learn two</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>from it:</b> First, that one can betroth a woman through intercourse, and second, that only a woman’s husband can render her a non-virgin by intercourse in an atypical manner.
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Since intercourse is not a momentary act but has different stages, does <b>the beginning of intercourse effect acquisition or</b> does <b>the end of intercourse effect acquisition?</b> When exactly is the moment of betrothal? The Gemara comments: The <b>practical difference</b> resulting from this question is in a case <b>where</b> one <b>engaged in</b> only <b>the initial stage of intercourse with her and</b> in the meantime <b>she reached her hand out and accepted betrothal from another</b> man. If the beginning of sexual intercourse effects acquisition, the other man’s betrothal is meaningless. If the end of sexual intercourse effects acquisition, she is betrothed to the other man.
<b>Alternatively,</b> there is a difference with regard <b>to a High Priest who acquires a virgin through sexual intercourse.</b> If only the end of intercourse effects acquisition, she is no longer a virgin at the time of the betrothal, which would mean that a High Priest cannot acquire a woman through intercourse, as it is prohibited for him to marry a non-virgin (Leviticus 21:14). <b>What,</b> then, is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Ameimar said in the name of Rava: Anyone who engages in sexual intercourse has the completion of</b> the act of <b>intercourse in mind,</b> not the beginning. Therefore, the acquisition is complete only when the act has been completed.
Additionally, <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Does the <b>sexual intercourse</b> that is performed to effect betrothal <b>effect marriage</b> at the same time that it effects betrothal, <b>or</b> does it <b>effect</b> only <b>betrothal? The practical difference</b> that arises from this question concerns all cases where it matters whether a woman is betrothed or married. For example, one issue is whether the act allows him <b>to inherit</b> property from <b>her.</b> If he betroths her through intercourse, does he inherit her property when she dies as he would if they were married?
<b>And</b> if he is a priest, is he required <b>to become ritually impure to</b> bury <b>her,</b> as he must do for his wife? <b>And</b> similarly, does a betrothal through intercourse allow him <b>to nullify her vows</b> by himself, without her father’s participation? <b>If you say</b> that intercourse <b>effects marriage, he inherits</b> property from <b>her, and he becomes impure to</b> bury <b>her, and he nullifies her vows</b> alone. <b>And if you say</b> that <b>it effects</b> only <b>betrothal, he does not inherit</b> property from <b>her, and he does not become ritually impure to</b> bury <b>her, and he cannot nullify her vows</b> alone. <b>What,</b> then, is the <i>halakha</i>?
<b>Abaye said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from the following mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 46b): <b>A father has authority</b> over <b>his daughter with regard to her betrothal,</b> whether it is <b>through money, through a document, or through sexual intercourse.</b> Likewise, a father <b>has a right to items she</b> has <b>found, and to her earnings, and to</b> effect <b>the nullification of her vows,</b> i.e., a father may nullify his daughter’s vows. <b>And he accepts her bill of divorce</b> on her behalf if she is divorced from betrothal before she becomes a grown woman. <b>And</b> although he inherits her property when she dies, e.g., property she inherited from her mother’s family, <b>he does not enjoy the profits</b> of her property <b>during her lifetime.</b> If the daughter <b>married, the husband has more</b> rights and obligations <b>than</b> her father had before the marriage, <b>as he enjoys the profits</b> of her property <b>during her lifetime.</b>
The mishna <b>teaches</b> that a man has rights to his daughter’s betrothal through <b>sexual intercourse, and</b> it subsequently <b>teaches:</b> If the daughter <b>married.</b> This indicates that intercourse effects only betrothal. The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>When it teaches:</b> If the daughter <b>married,</b> that is referring <b>to the other</b> modes mentioned here, i.e., betrothal by means of money or a document. In these cases there is a difference between betrothal and marriage, while it is possible that betrothal through intercourse effects marriage as well.
<b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from a <i>baraita</i>: A girl who is <b>three years and one day old can be betrothed through intercourse, and if</b> her <b><i>yavam</i> engaged in intercourse with her, he has acquired her. And</b> if she is married, <b>one is liable</b> if he engages in intercourse <b>with her, due to</b> her status as <b>a married woman. And</b> if she is impure as a menstruating woman, <b>she renders one who engages in intercourse with her ritually impure</b> for seven days.

Daf 10b

And he <b>renders impure the object upon which he lies like the upper one.</b> One who engages in sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman renders the objects upon which he lies ritually impure even if he has no direct contact with them.
<b>And if she marries a priest she may partake of <i>teruma</i></b> from that point onward. <b>And if one of those with whom sexual relations are forbidden by the Torah</b> (see Leviticus, chapter 18) <b>engages in intercourse with her, he is put to death due to</b> his sin with <b>her, and she is exempt</b> from punishment as a minor. <b>And if someone of unfit</b> lineage, i.e., a man who would disqualify her from marrying a priest if he engaged in sexual intercourse with her, <b>engages in intercourse with her, he has disqualified her from</b> marrying into <b>the priesthood.</b> This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara analyzes this source. <b>It is taught</b> in that <i>baraita</i>: She can be betrothed through <b>sexual intercourse, and it is taught</b> separately: And if <b>she marries</b> a priest. This indicates that intercourse does not effect marriage. The Gemara rejects this: <b>This is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>said: If this</b> betrothal through intercourse <b>is a marriage to a priest, she may partake of <i>teruma</i>.</b> It is possible that there are not two separate stages here but a single action, as sexual intercourse effects marriage.
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And Yoḥanan ben Bag Bag already sent</b> a message <b>to Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira in</b> the city of <b>Netzivin: I heard about you that you say</b> that <b>the daughter of a non-priest betrothed</b> to a priest <b>may partake of <i>teruma</i>.</b> Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira <b>sent</b> back this reply <b>to him: And do you not say so? I know about you that you are an expert in</b> many <b>areas of Torah; do you not know how to teach</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>based on an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference?
The <i>a fortiori</i> inference is as follows: <b>If</b> in the case of <b>a Canaanite maidservant, whose sexual intercourse</b> with a priest <b>does not allow her to partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> as she is not betrothed to him, <b>her money,</b> i.e., if a priest acquires her through money, <b>allows her to partake of <i>teruma</i>, is it not logical</b> with regard to <b>this</b> betrothed woman, <b>whose sexual intercourse</b> with a priest <b>allows her to partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> that <b>her</b> betrothal <b>money</b> from the priest should <b>allow her to partake of <i>teruma</i>?</b> If this is indeed the case, the daughter of a non-priest betrothed to a priest should be permitted to partake of <i>teruma</i>. <b>But what can I do, as the Sages said:</b> By rabbinic law, <b>the daughter of a non-priest betrothed</b> to a priest <b>may not partake of <i>teruma</i> until she enters the</b> wedding <b>canopy.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the comparison between money and sexual intercourse? <b>If</b> it is referring to a case <b>of sexual intercourse by means of</b> a wedding <b>canopy,</b> i.e., after they are married, <b>and</b> betrothal through <b>money</b> where the marriage is then completed <b>by means of</b> a wedding <b>canopy, in both</b> cases <b>she may partake of</b> <i>teruma</i> even by rabbinic law, as she is a full-fledged married woman.
<b>Or rather</b> one could say that this comparison is referring to <b>sexual intercourse by means of</b> a wedding <b>canopy, and</b> betrothal through <b>money not by means of</b> a wedding <b>canopy.</b> If so, the <i>a fortiori</i> inference is not valid, as <b>here,</b> in the case of intercourse, there are <b>two</b> stages of acquisition, intercourse followed by the wedding canopy, <b>and here,</b> in the case of money, there is only <b>one</b> stage. <b>Rather, is it not</b> correct to say that the comparison between money and intercourse is referring <b>to sexual intercourse not by means of</b> a wedding <b>canopy and</b> also <b>money not by means of</b> a wedding <b>canopy?</b>
<b>Granted, if you say</b> that intercourse by itself <b>effects marriage,</b> it is <b>due to that</b> reason that it <b>is obvious to</b> Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira <b>that</b> the mode of <b>sexual intercourse is stronger than money,</b> and allows her to partake of <i>teruma</i>. <b>But if you say</b> that sexual intercourse <b>effects</b> only <b>betrothal, what is different here,</b> in the case of betrothal through intercourse, <b>that it is obvious to him</b> that it allows her to partake of <i>teruma</i>, <b>and what is different here,</b> in the case of betrothal through money, <b>that he is uncertain</b> and must derive the matter through an <i>a fortiori</i> inference? In both cases she is only betrothed.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Actually, I will say to you</b> that he is speaking <b>about sexual intercourse by means of</b> a wedding <b>canopy and money not by means of</b> a wedding <b>canopy. And</b> as for <b>that which you said</b> in opposition to this <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>Here</b> there are <b>two</b> stages of acquisition, <b>and here</b> there is only <b>one</b> stage. <b>In any event, there is</b> a valid <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference.
<b>And this is what</b> Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira <b>sent him,</b> i.e., his statement should be understood as follows: <b>If a Canaanite maidservant, whose intercourse</b> with a priest <b>does not allow her to partake of <i>teruma</i>, even by means of</b> a wedding <b>canopy,</b> and yet <b>her money allows her to partake</b> of <i>teruma</i> <b>without</b> the means of a wedding <b>canopy, is it not logical</b> with regard to <b>this</b> betrothed woman, <b>whose intercourse</b> with a priest <b>allows her to partake of <i>teruma</i> by means of</b> a wedding <b>canopy,</b> that <b>her</b> betrothal <b>money</b> from the priest should <b>allow her to partake of <i>teruma</i> without</b> the means of a wedding <b>canopy?</b>
<b>But what can I do, as the Sages said:</b> By rabbinic law, <b>the daughter of a non-priest betrothed</b> to a priest <b>may not partake of <i>teruma</i> until she enters the</b> wedding <b>canopy, due to</b> the reason stated <b>by Ulla.</b> According to Ulla, there is a concern that she may feed her siblings or members of her family <i>teruma</i> while she is still living in her father’s house.
<b>And ben Bag Bag</b> explains why one cannot accept this <i>a fortiori</i> inference involving a Canaanite maidservant: <b>With regard to a Canaanite maidservant</b> who is purchased with money, the buyer <b>does not leave out</b> anything <b>from her acquisition,</b> i.e., he completes the purchase in full. <b>Here,</b> in the case of betrothal, <b>he leaves out</b> part <b>of her acquisition,</b> as the stage of marriage has yet to be performed. Therefore, these two cases are dissimilar.
<b>Ravina said</b> that <b>by Torah law, it is obvious to</b> Yoḥanan ben Bag Bag <b>that</b> she <b>may partake of</b> <i>teruma</i> also when she is betrothed to a priest through money alone, as she is acquired with his money. <b>And</b> the question <b>that he sent him</b> is referring to the <i>halakha</i> <b>by rabbinic law.</b>
Ravina elaborates: <b>And this is</b> the question <b>that he sent to him: I heard about you that you say</b> that in practice <b>the daughter of a non-priest betrothed</b> to a priest <b>may partake of <i>teruma</i>, and we are not concerned about an annulling factor [<i>simfon</i>],</b> i.e., that he might find some blemish in her through which the betrothal would be considered retroactively invalid. If so, she would have eaten <i>teruma</i> when she was not permitted to do so. And it was with regard to this issue that Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira <b>sent to him: And do you not say this? I know about you that you are an expert in</b> many <b>areas of Torah; do you not know how to teach</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>based on an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference?
The <i>a fortiori</i> inference is as follows: <b>If a Canaanite maidservant, whose</b> engaging in <b>intercourse</b> with a priest <b>does not allow her to partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> and yet <b>her</b> receiving purchase <b>money allows her to partake of <i>teruma</i>, and we are not concerned about <i>simfon</i>,</b> i.e., that the Canaanite maidservant may have some physical blemish that nullifies her purchase retroactively, <b>is it not logical</b> with regard to <b>this</b> betrothed woman, <b>whose intercourse</b> with a priest <b>allows her to partake of <i>teruma</i>, that her</b> receiving betrothal <b>money</b> from the priest should <b>allow her to partake of <i>teruma</i></b> even before entering the wedding canopy, <b>and we should not be concerned about <i>simfon</i>? But what can I do, as the Sages said:</b> By rabbinic law <b>the daughter of a non-priest betrothed</b> to a priest <b>may not partake of <i>teruma</i></b>

Daf 11a

<b>until she enters the</b> wedding <b>canopy, due to</b> the reason <b>of Ulla,</b> lest she feed her non-priestly family members the <i>teruma</i> that her husband has given her.
The Gemara asks: <b>And ben Bag Bag,</b> what does he say about this <i>a fortiori</i> inference? The Gemara answers that he maintains that this <i>a fortiori</i> inference is invalid because <b>he does not accept</b> that there can be a claim of <b><i>simfon</i> with regard to</b> the acquisition <b>of slaves.</b> The reason is that <b>if it is an exposed blemish</b> that the master found on the slave, <b>he saw</b> the blemish and purchased him regardless. Therefore, he cannot later claim that the transaction was unfair. <b>If</b> it is <b>due to hidden blemishes</b> on his slave, <b>what difference does that make to him?</b> Why should it matter if a slave has hidden blemishes? <b>He needs him</b> only <b>for labor,</b> and <b>he does not care</b> if he has hidden blemishes that do not impair his ability to perform labor.
And even if this slave <b>is discovered</b> to be <b>a thief or a gambler [<i>kuvyustus</i>],</b> which are considered hidden blemishes that affect his work, <b>it has come to him,</b> i.e., the slave is acquired by the one who purchased him and the transaction is non-refundable. The reason is that the buyer should have suspected behavior of this kind, which is common among slaves, and therefore he suffers the loss. <b>What do you say?</b> Perhaps he discovered that the slave is <b>an armed bandit</b> and subject to be killed by the government for this, <b>or sentenced</b> to death <b>by the government</b> for another reason, and is sought by the authorities. This is not a valid claim, since <b>these</b> matters <b>generate publicity,</b> and therefore he is assumed to have taken the risk into consideration.
The Gemara asks: <b>Now, both according to</b> the one <b>Master,</b> Yoḥanan ben Bag Bag, <b>and according to</b> the other <b>Master,</b> Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira, the daughter of a non-priest betrothed to a priest <b>may not partake</b> of <i>teruma</i> by rabbinic decree. <b>What,</b> then, <b>is</b> the difference <b>between them?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>The</b> difference <b>between them</b> involves three cases. The Gemara elaborates: If the husband initially <b>accepted</b> her blemishes, there is no concern that an annulling factor might lead to the nullification of the betrothal, but there is still concern that she might feed <i>teruma</i> to the members of her family. If her father <b>transferred</b> her to the betrothed husband’s agents, <b>or</b> if the father’s agents <b>walked</b> with the husband’s messenger, and therefore she is no longer in her father’s house, there is no concern that she might feed her family members <i>teruma</i>, but it remains possible that the betrothal will be nullified.
§ The Gemara returns to the <i>halakhot</i> of the mishna. The mishna teaches that if one betroths a woman <b>with money, Beit Shammai say</b> he must betroth her <b>with</b> at least <b>one dinar,</b> whereas according to the opinion of Beit Hillel even one <i>peruta</i> is sufficient. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Beit Shammai? Rabbi Zeira says:</b> Their reasoning is <b>that a woman is particular about herself</b> and considers it beneath her dignity to be acquired with a paltry sum, <b>and</b> therefore she <b>will not</b> agree to <b>be betrothed with less than one dinar.</b>
<b>Abaye said to him: If that is so, with regard to Rabbi Yannai’s daughters, for example, who are</b> very <b>particular about themselves</b> and their honor, <b>and they will not</b> agree to <b>be betrothed with less than three <i>kav</i> of dinars</b> due to their status, <b>so too</b> will you say <b>that if she reaches out her hand and accepts one dinar from another</b> man, <b>so too,</b> this <b>is not a betrothal?</b>
Rabbi Zeira <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>I did not say</b> that this <i>halakha</i> includes a case where <b>she reached out her hand and accepted</b> a betrothal. She has the right to willingly relinquish her dignity. <b>When I said</b> this <i>halakha</i> I was referring to a case <b>where he betrothed her at night</b> and she did not see what she was being given. <b>Alternatively, where she appointed an agent</b> to betroth her but did not explicitly tell him how much she wished to receive for her betrothal. In these cases it is assumed that she is particular about her honor and will not agree to be betrothed for less than one dinar.
<b>Rav Yosef said</b> a different explanation: <b>The reasoning of Beit Shammai is in accordance with</b> that <b>which Rav Yehuda</b> says that <b>Rav Asi says. As Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav Asi says: Every</b> sum of <b>money mentioned in the Torah is</b> in <b>Tyrian coinage,</b> i.e., dinars from Tyre, which have a high value. <b>And</b> any amount of money set <b>by rabbinic law</b> is measured by <b>provincial coinage.</b> Local currency, i.e., that which existed at the time of the Sages of the Mishna, was worth about one-eighth of the value of Tyrian coinage. Beit Shammai follow the standard sum of the Torah, and the smallest possible amount in Tyrian currency is the silver coin, which is worth one dinar.
The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav Asi says: Every</b> sum of <b>money mentioned in the Torah is Tyrian coinage, and</b> any amount of money set <b>by rabbinic law</b> is measured by <b>provincial coinage.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And is</b> it an established <b>principle</b> that any mention of money in the Torah is referring to a silver coin worth at least one dinar?

Daf 11b

<b>But</b> with regard to <b>a claim that</b> someone has not returned a deposit or loan, when the defendant admits that only part of the claim is true, <b>it is written: “If a man deliver to his neighbor money or vessels to guard</b> and it be stolen out of the man’s house” (Exodus 22:6). The following verses teach that if the thief is not found, the case is brought to a court, where the defendant must take an oath. <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna with regard to one who admits to part of a claim (<i>Shevuot</i> 38b): <b>The oath</b> administered <b>by the judges</b> to one who admits to part of a claim is administered only when <b>the claim</b> is for at least <b>two silver</b> <i>ma’a</i>, <b>and the</b> defendant’s <b>admission</b> is to at least <b>the value of one <i>peruta</i>.</b> If every sum of money mentioned in the Torah is referring to Tyrian coinage, how did the Sages arrive at the amount of two <i>ma’a</i> in this case?
The Gemara explains: <b>There,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is derived from a juxtaposition, as the “money” mentioned in the verse is <b>similar to “vessels”: Just as</b> the word <b>“vessels”</b> indicates at least <b>two, so too “money”</b> is referring to at least <b>two</b> coins. <b>And just as money is a significant item, so too</b> the <b>vessels</b> must be <b>a significant item.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> there is the case of the redemption of second <b>tithe, as it is written: “And bind up the money in your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:25). <b>And</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 2:8): With regard to <b>one who exchanges</b> copper coins <b>of second-tithe money</b> for <b>a <i>sela</i>,</b> Beit Shammai say: He may exchange the copper coins for the entire silver <i>sela</i>. This mishna indicates that second-tithe money, mentioned in the Torah, can be in the form of copper coins, and it is not required to be in the form of silver coins. The Gemara explains that the verse does not say <b>money,</b> but <b>“the money.”</b> The addition of the article <b>serves as an amplification.</b> In other words, this addition teaches that second-tithe money can be in any coinage, including copper coins.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> there is the case of <b>consecrated</b> property, <b>as it is written: “And he will give the money and it will be assured to him”</b> (see Leviticus 27:19). <b>And Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>consecrated</b> property <b>worth one hundred dinars, which was redeemed for</b> an item <b>worth one <i>peruta</i>, it is redeemed.</b> Although the word “money” is stated in the Torah, a copper <i>peruta</i> may be used. The Gemara answers: <b>There too,</b> there is a reason for this unusual <i>halakha</i>, as <b>he derives</b> this ruling from a verbal analogy of the terms <b>“money”</b> mentioned here and <b>“money” from tithes.</b> Consequently, one may use any type of coin in this case as well.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> there is the case of <b>the betrothal of a woman, as it is written: “When a man takes a woman and engages in sexual intercourse with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and one derives</b> betrothal through money by a verbal analogy of the term <b>“taking”</b> used here and <b>“taking” from</b> the case of <b>the field of Ephron. And</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in the mishna that <b>Beit Hillel say</b> one can betroth a woman <b>with one <i>peruta</i> or with</b> any item that is <b>worth one <i>peruta</i>.</b> If so, <b>shall we say</b> that <b>Rav Asi,</b> who claims that all sums of money mentioned in the Torah are in Tyrian coinage, <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai?</b>
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara suggests an alternative explanation: <b>If</b> this <b>was stated,</b> it <b>was stated like this: Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav Asi says: Every set</b> amount of <b>money stated in the Torah,</b> i.e., when a specific amount is mentioned, is referring to <b>Tyrian coinage, and</b> any amount of money set <b>by rabbinic law</b> is in <b>provincial coinage.</b>
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>what is</b> Rav Asi <b>teaching us?</b> We have already <b>learned</b> all of these <i>halakhot</i> explicitly (<i>Bekhorot</i> 49b): The payment of <b>five <i>sela</i> for</b> the redemption of a firstborn <b>son</b> (Numbers 18:16);the payment of <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i> <b>for a slave,</b> paid by the owner of the ox that killed the slave (Exodus 21:32); the <b>fifty</b> <i>sela</i> paid <b>by a rapist and by a seducer</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29); the <b>one hundred</b> <i>sela</i> paid <b>by a defamer</b> (Deuteronomy 22:19); <b>all of these are</b> paid <b>in the sacred shekel,</b> which is <b>one hundred dinars in Tyrian</b> coinage. All of the cases in which a defined amount is mentioned by the Torah have already been taught, and it is unclear what Rav Asi adds.
The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary for</b> Rav Asi to teach: <b>And</b> any amount of money set <b>by rabbinic law</b> is in <b>provincial coinage, as we did not learn</b> that <i>halakha</i> in that mishna. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Sages established that <b>one who strikes another</b> as an act of disrespect <b>must give him one <i>sela</i></b> as a fine. <b>And</b> Rav Asi is teaching that one should <b>not say: What</b> is the meaning of <b>one <i>sela</i>?</b> It is a Tyrian <i>sela</i> worth <b>four dinar. Rather, what</b> is the meaning of <b>one <i>sela</i>?</b> This is the <i>sela</i> of provincial coinage, which is worth <b>half a dinar, as people commonly call half a dinar</b> by the name <b><i>sela</i> [<i>isteira</i>].</b>
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says</b> a different explanation: <b>The reasoning of Beit Shammai,</b> that the minimum amount with which a woman can be betrothed is one dinar, is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Ḥizkiyya. As Ḥizkiyya says</b> that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to a Hebrew maidservant: <b>“Then he shall let her be redeemed”</b> (Exodus 21:8), which <b>teaches that she can deduct</b> an amount <b>from</b> the price of <b>her redemption and leave</b> before her time of slavery is complete. If she comes into possession of money, she can pay the master for her value, less the work she has performed. Beit Shammai derive the <i>halakhot</i> of regular betrothal from the case of a Hebrew maidservant, as explained below.
<b>Granted, if you say that</b> when she was acquired <b>he gave her</b> at least <b>one dinar, this is</b> the meaning of the statement <b>that she may continually deduct</b> from that amount <b>up to one <i>peruta</i>. But if you say that</b> he <b>gave her one <i>peruta</i></b> when he purchased her as a maidservant, can <b>she deduct from one <i>peruta</i>?</b> One <i>peruta</i> is already the smallest possible sum of money. The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>But perhaps this is what the Merciful One is saying:</b> In a case <b>where he gave her one dinar, she deducts</b> from that amount <b>up to one <i>peruta</i>;</b> in <b>a case where he gave her one <i>peruta</i> she cannot deduct at all.</b> If he paid one <i>peruta</i> for her, the option of redemption does not apply.

Daf 12a

The Gemara rejects this suggestion: This <b>cannot enter your mind,</b> as the <i>halakha</i> of deduction must be <b>similar</b> to the <i>halakha</i> of <b>designation,</b> i.e., the process by which a master designates his Hebrew maidservant as a wife for him or his son (Exodus 21:8–9). <b>Just as</b> with <b>designation, although</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>if he desires, he may designate</b> her <b>and if he does not desire, he</b> is <b>not</b> required to <b>designate</b> her, nevertheless <b>anywhere that he cannot designate</b> her, e.g., in a case where they are related and she is therefore forbidden to him, <b>her sale is not</b> a valid <b>sale, so too</b> here, with regard to her redemption, <b>anywhere that she cannot deduct</b> an amount from her purchase price, <b>her sale is not</b> a valid <b>sale.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai</b> the mode of <b>betrothal of a woman</b> by money <b>is derived from</b> the case of <b>a Hebrew maidservant,</b> as follows: <b>Just as a Hebrew maidservant cannot be acquired with one <i>peruta</i>, so too a woman cannot be betrothed with one <i>peruta</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: Even if Beit Shammai derive their opinion from here, how does this prove that a woman can be betrothed only with a minimum of one dinar? <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> she can be betrothed with <b>half a dinar, or say</b> that she can be betrothed with <b>two <i>perutot</i>,</b> as it is possible to fulfill the redemption of a Hebrew maidservant if her sale was for either of these amounts? The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> this comparison <b>excludes</b> betrothal <b>with one <i>peruta</i>,</b> as it indicates that a woman can be betrothed only with money of significant value, the Sages <b>established</b> the minimum amount <b>at one dinar,</b> which is a coin of substantial value.
<b>Rava said</b> a different explanation: <b>This is the reasoning of Beit Shammai,</b> who hold that a woman can be betrothed only with a minimum of one dinar: <b>The daughters of Israel should not be</b> treated <b>like ownerless</b> property. Allowing women to be betrothed with such a small amount as one <i>peruta</i> is disrespectful to them.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And Beit Hillel say</b> that a woman can be betrothed <b>with one <i>peruta</i>,</b> or with any item that is worth one <i>peruta</i>. <b>Rav Yosef thought to say: One <i>peruta</i></b> means <b>any amount.</b> There is no defined value, as a woman may be betrothed with one <i>peruta</i> regardless of its value at the time. <b>Abaye said to him: But isn’t it taught with regard to</b> this in the mishna itself: <b>How much is one <i>peruta</i>?</b> It is <b>one-eighth of the Italian <i>issar</i>.</b> This shows there is a defined value for one <i>peruta</i>.
<b>And if you would say: This statement</b> applies <b>only to the generation of Moses,</b> i.e., this was the value of one <i>peruta</i> in the time of the Torah, <b>but now,</b> at any later time, its value is determined by <b>that which people consider</b> one <i>peruta</i>, that claim cannot be correct. <b>As when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>he said: Rabbi Simai estimated in his generation: How much is one <i>peruta</i>?</b> It is <b>one-eighth of the Italian <i>issar</i>. And when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said</b> that <b>Rabbi Dostai and Rabbi Yannai and Rabbi Oshaya estimated: How much is one <i>peruta</i>?</b> It is <b>one-sixth of the Italian <i>issar</i>.</b>
<b>Rav Yosef said to</b> Abaye: <b>If so,</b> then <b>this is</b> in conflict with that <b>which we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Go and calculate how many <i>perutot</i> there are in two <i>sela</i>: More than two thousand. Now there are not</b> even <b>two thousand, and you call them: More than two thousand?</b> Rather, the <i>peruta</i> is certainly worth less than one-eighth of the Italian <i>issar</i>. <b>A certain old man said to them: I teach this</b> <i>baraita</i> as saying: <b>Close to two thousand.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Ultimately,</b> according to the calculation of one-eighth of an <i>issar</i>, the number of <i>perutot</i> in two <i>sela</i> <b>is 1,536,</b> which is nowhere near two thousand. The Gemara answers: <b>Since it passes half</b> of the second thousand <b>it is called: Close to two thousand.</b>
The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>he said: Rabbi Simai estimated in his generation: How much is one <i>peruta</i>?</b> It is <b>one-eighth of the Italian <i>issar</i>. And when Ravin came he said</b> that <b>Rabbi Dostai and Rabbi Yannai and Rabbi Oshaya estimated: How much is one <i>peruta</i>?</b> It is <b>one-sixth of the Italian <i>issar</i>. Abaye said to Rav Dimi: Shall we say</b> that <b>you and Ravin disagree with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute between these <i>tanna’im</i>.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b><i>peruta</i> mentioned by the Sages</b> is <b>one-eighth of the Italian <i>issar</i>. Six silver <i>ma’a</i></b> are one <b>dinar,</b> and one <b><i>ma’a</i></b> is worth <b>two <i>pundeyon</i>.</b> In <b>a <i>pundeyon</i></b> there are <b>two <i>issar</i>,</b> and <b>an <i>issar</i></b> is <b>two <i>masmas</i>. A <i>masmas</i></b> is worth <b>two <i>konterank</i>,</b> and a <b><i>konterank</i></b> is <b>two <i>perutot</i>.</b> By this calculation, one <b>finds</b> that <b>one <i>peruta</i></b> is <b>one-eighth of the Italian <i>issar</i>.</b>
<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> This is not the case; rather, there are <b>three <i>hadreis</i> to a <i>ma’a</i>, two <i>henetz</i> to a <i>hadreis</i>, two <i>shamin</i> to a <i>henetz</i>,</b> and <b>two <i>perutot</i> to a <i>shamin</i>.</b> Consequently, one <b>finds</b> that one <b><i>peruta</i></b> is <b>one-sixth of the Italian <i>issar</i>. Shall we say that</b> one <b>Master agrees with the first <i>tanna</i>, and Ravin, who said</b> his ruling in the name of Rabbi Dostai and Rabbi Yannai and Rabbi Oshaya, <b>agrees with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel?</b>
Rav Dimi <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>Both my</b> statement <b>and</b> that of <b>Ravin</b> are <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>, and it</b> is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement of mine is referring to <b>when</b> the <b><i>issar</i> increased in value</b> in relation to silver coins, and <b>this</b> statement of Ravin is referring to <b>when</b> the <b><i>issar</i> decreased in value.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>When</b> the <b><i>issar</i> increased in value, twenty-four</b> <i>issar</i> <b>stood at one dinar; when</b> they <b>decreased in value, thirty-two</b> <i>issar</i> <b>stood at one dinar.</b> If so, there is a set ratio between the value of a <i>peruta</i> and the value of silver, and there are 192 <i>perutot</i> in one dinar. By contrast, the ratio between the value of a copper <i>issar</i> and silver dinars fluctuates, so that sometimes an <i>issar</i> will be worth eight <i>perutot</i> while at other times it is worth only six.
§ <b>Shmuel says:</b> If man <b>betrothed</b> a woman <b>with a date, she is betrothed even</b> if <b>a <i>kor</i> of dates is worth one dinar,</b> which would mean that one date is worth much less than one <i>peruta</i>. The reason is that although a date has little value here, <b>we are concerned that perhaps it is worth one <i>peruta</i> in Media</b> or in some other distant place where dates are expensive. Therefore, she is betrothed in this location as well.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the <b>mishna</b> that <b>Beit Hillel say: With one <i>peruta</i> or with</b> an item <b>worth one <i>peruta</i>,</b> but not less? The Gemara explains: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement in the mishna is referring <b>to betrothal</b> whose status is <b>certain.</b> Betrothal with one <i>peruta</i> or an item worth one <i>peruta</i> is certainly valid. Conversely, <b>this</b> case stated by Shmuel is referring <b>to betrothal</b> whose status is <b>uncertain.</b> Although the item is not worth one <i>peruta</i> here, there is a concern that the betrothal might nevertheless be valid.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who betrothed</b> a woman <b>with a bundle of rags [<i>zavda de’urdei</i>]. Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya sat before Rav and examined</b> the bundle to see <b>if it had the value of one <i>peruta</i>.</b> If it was worth one <i>peruta</i>, <b>yes,</b> she was betrothed, <b>and if not, no,</b> she was not betrothed. The Gemara asks: <b>And if it does not have the value of one <i>peruta</i>,</b> is she <b>not</b> betrothed? <b>But didn’t Shmuel say</b> that <b>we are concerned</b> that the item might be worth one <i>peruta</i> in Media? The Gemara explains: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> ruling of Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya is referring <b>to betrothal</b> whose status is <b>certain,</b> whereas <b>this</b> statement of Shmuel is referring <b>to betrothal</b> whose status is <b>uncertain.</b>
The Gemara further relates: There was <b>a certain man who betrothed</b> a woman <b>with a blue marble stone. Rav Ḥisda sat and estimated</b> whether <b>it</b> was worth one <i>peruta</i>. <b>If it was worth one <i>peruta</i>, yes,</b> she was betrothed, <b>and if not, no,</b> she was not betrothed. The Gemara asks: <b>And if it does not have the value of one <i>peruta</i>,</b> is she <b>not</b> betrothed? <b>But didn’t Shmuel say</b> that <b>we are concerned</b> that the item might be worth one <i>peruta</i> in Media? The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Ḥisda does not hold</b> in accordance with <b>that</b> opinion <b>of Shmuel,</b> as he holds that if the item is not worth one <i>peruta</i> in the place where the betrothal occurred, the betrothal is invalid.
<b>The mother of</b> the man who offered the betrothal <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: <b>But on that day that he betrothed her it was worth one <i>peruta</i>. He said to</b> the mother: <b>It is not in your</b> power <b>to render her forbidden to a later</b> man. If another comes and betroths her, his betrothal is not dismissed due to this earlier act. Since the marble stone is not worth one <i>peruta</i> now, the betrothal of the second man may be valid.

Daf 12b

Rav Ḥisda explained: <b>Is this not</b> similar to the case of <b>Yehudit, wife of Rabbi Ḥiyya, who would have painful childbirths</b> and therefore wished to leave Rabbi Ḥiyya? <b>She said to</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya: <b>My mother told me: When you were young your father accepted betrothal on your behalf</b> from another man, which would render Yehudit forbidden to Rabbi Ḥiyya. <b>He said to her: It is not in your mother’s</b> power <b>to render you forbidden to me,</b> as this testimony is insufficient.
Returning to the incident with the blue marble stone, the Gemara relates that <b>the Sages said to Rav Ḥisda: Why</b> do you say that she is not betrothed because the item is not worth one <i>peruta</i> in the place where the betrothal occurred? After all, <b>there are witnesses in Idit who know that on that day it had the value of one <i>peruta</i>.</b> Rav Ḥisda said to them: <b>Now, in any event, they are not here,</b> and therefore their potential testimony is disregarded.
Rav Ḥisda cites a proof for his statement: <b>Isn’t this</b> the same as the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥanina?</b> In the case of a woman who appeared before the court and said that she was taken captive but remained undefiled, if there are no witnesses that she was captured, her entire claim must be accepted, and therefore she is permitted to her husband. Although there are witnesses elsewhere who can testify that she was taken captive, and consequently, the court need not rely on her statement alone, <b>as Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> When <b>her witnesses</b> are far away <b>in the north [<i>istan</i>], will she be forbidden?</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>Abaye and Rava do not hold</b> in accordance <b>with this</b> statement <b>of Rav Ḥisda</b> with regard to betrothal. In their opinion one cannot learn the <i>halakha</i> here from Rabbi Ḥanina’s statement, as there is a difference between the cases: <b>If</b> in the case of Rabbi Ḥanina the Sages <b>were lenient with regard to a captive woman, who makes herself appear repulsive before her captor</b> so that he will not rape her, and it is therefore believable that she was not violated, <b>shall we be lenient with regard to</b> the serious prohibition of <b>a married woman?</b>
The Gemara reports: Descendants <b>of the family</b> of the woman who had been betrothed with a blue marble stone <b>remained in Sura,</b> as after Rav Ḥisda ruled that that woman’s first betrothal was invalid, she married another man and had children. <b>But the Sages avoided</b> the family and refused to marry into it due to the concern that it was founded on a possibly adulterous relationship, which would render the descendants of the family <i>mamzerim</i>. The Gemara comments: <b>And it was not because they maintained,</b> in accordance <b>with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel,</b> that there is a concern that any item might be worth one <i>peruta</i> somewhere else. <b>Rather,</b> it was <b>because they held</b> in accordance <b>with</b> the opinion of <b>Abaye and Rava,</b> who said: Since there are witnesses in a different place, one must take them into account.
§ The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who betrothed</b> a woman <b>with a myrtle branch in the marketplace. Rav Aḥa bar Huna sent</b> this dilemma <b>before Rav Yosef: In a case like this, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Rav Yosef <b>sent</b> a response <b>to him: Flog him, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, and require</b> her to receive <b>a bill of divorce, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel,</b> in case the myrtle branch is worth one <i>peruta</i> somewhere else.
The Gemara explains <b>that Rav</b> would <b>flog</b> a man <b>for betrothing</b> a woman <b>in the marketplace,</b> because this is disrespectful and crude, <b>and for betrothing</b> a woman <b>through sexual intercourse,</b> as it is unsavory to invite witnesses to observe a man and woman enter a room to engage in intercourse. <b>And</b> he would also flog a man <b>for betrothing</b> a woman <b>without an arrangement [<i>shiddukhei</i>],</b> i.e., if he did not discuss betrothal with the woman before betrothing her. Each of these acts is considered indecent behavior.
<b>And</b> likewise, Rav would flog a man <b>for nullifying a bill of divorce</b> he has already sent to his wife, <b>and for issuing a declaration</b> preemptively invalidating <b>a bill of divorce.</b> The latter case is referring to one who announces before giving a bill of divorce that he is divorcing his wife against his will, thereby rendering the document ineffective. This behavior might lead to a grave sin if the wife marries another man under the mistaken impression that she is divorced. <b>And</b> similarly, Rav would flog anyone <b>for tormenting a messenger of the Sages,</b> as this indicates a lack of regard for the Sages. <b>And</b> Rav would flog <b>one who had an excommunication take effect on him for thirty days</b> and yet does not repent or appeal to the Sages to annul his censure.
<b>And</b> Rav would flog <b>a son-in-law who lives in his father-in-law’s house,</b> as there is a concern that he might sin with his mother-in-law. The Gemara comments: This indicates that with regard to one <b>who lives</b> in his father-in-law’s house permanently, <b>yes,</b> he is flogged, whereas with regard to one who only <b>passes by</b> his father-in-law’s house, <b>no,</b> he is not flogged. <b>But</b> there was <b>a certain son-in-law who passed by the entrance of his father-in-law’s house and Rav Sheshet flogged him</b> due to licentiousness. The Gemara explains: In <b>that</b> case, <b>there were suspicions [<i>dayma</i>] about him and his mother-in-law,</b> i.e., about rumors of intimacy between them. In walking by the house he contributed to these rumors, which is why he was flogged.
The Sages <b>of Neharde’a say: Rav would not flog</b> a violator <b>in all of</b> the cases listed, <b>but</b> he would in fact flog a man <b>for betrothing</b> a woman <b>through sexual intercourse without</b> a prior <b>arrangement. And there are</b> those <b>who say: Even if</b> there was <b>an arrangement beforehand,</b> he would <b>also</b> flog a man for betrothing a woman with intercourse, <b>due to licentiousness,</b> as it is indecent to have witnesses observe a man and woman enter a room to engage in intercourse.
§ The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who betrothed</b> a woman <b>with a mat of myrtle branches.</b> People who were present <b>said to him: But it is not worth one <i>peruta</i>. He said to them:</b> If so, <b>let her be betrothed with</b> the <b>four dinars that are</b> wrapped <b>in</b> the mat. The woman <b>took</b> the mat <b>and was silent. Rava said: This is silence after</b> the <b>money is given, and any silence after</b> the <b>money is given is nothing.</b> Since it was assumed at the time that he gave her an item worth less than one <i>peruta</i>, there is no proof that she acted in accordance with his subsequent statement. It is possible that she ignored him and did not intend to become betrothed with the four dinars.
<b>Rava said: From where do I state</b> this opinion? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that in a case where a man <b>said to</b> a woman: <b>Take this <i>sela</i> as a deposit, and he</b> subsequently <b>went back and said to her: Be betrothed to me with it,</b> if he said this <b>at the time</b> the <b>money</b> was <b>given, she is betrothed.</b> In a case where he said this <b>after</b> the <b>money</b> was <b>given,</b> then if <b>she wanted</b> to be betrothed in this manner, <b>she is betrothed.</b> If <b>she did not want</b> it, <b>she is not betrothed.</b>
The Gemara inquires: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>She wanted, and what</b> is the meaning of: <b>She did not want? If we say</b> that: <b>She wanted,</b> means <b>that she said yes,</b> she wishes to be betrothed, and: <b>She did not want,</b> means that <b>she</b> explicitly <b>said no,</b> one can learn <b>by inference</b> that in <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, when he spoke as he gave her the money and no difference is suggested between her wanting or not wanting,

Daf 13a

that <b>if</b> she <b>said: No, it would also be</b> a <b>betrothal.</b> But <b>why</b> should that be the case? After all, <b>she said: No. Rather, is it not</b> to be explained in this manner, i.e., that the phrase: <b>She wanted,</b> means <b>she said yes,</b> and: <b>She did not want,</b> means <b>that she remained silent. And</b> one can <b>learn from this</b> that <b>silence after</b> the <b>money is given is nothing.</b> Her silence is not interpreted as an agreement to the betrothal.
<b>In</b> the city of <b>Pum Nahara they raised a difficulty against</b> Rava’s proof, <b>in the name of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: Is it comparable? There,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>he gave her</b> the money <b>as a deposit</b> but they are his. She therefore <b>thinks: If I throw them and they break I will be obligated</b> to pay <b>for them,</b> as would anyone who destroys another person’s property. Consequently, her silence is interpreted as consent only to continue in her role of holding it as a deposit. By contrast, <b>here he gives them to her as betrothal</b> money so that they would belong to her. <b>And if it is so, that she is not amenable</b> to being betrothed, <b>let her throw them</b> away.
<b>Rav Aḥai refutes</b> this argument: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>all women are learned</b> in <b><i>halakha</i>?</b> In this case <b>also, she thinks: If I throw them and they break I will be responsible for them.</b> Therefore, I will not throw them. One cannot deduce from the fact that she does not throw the coins that she accepted them as betrothal money. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Rav, sent</b> this question <b>to Ravina: In a case like this, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Ravina <b>sent</b> the following response <b>to him: We did not hear this statement of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua.</b> Therefore, we do not need to take it into consideration. <b>You, who heard it, should be concerned about</b> a possible betrothal.
§ The Gemara further relates: There was <b>a certain woman who was selling belts. A certain man came</b> and <b>snatched a belt [<i>varshekha</i>] from her. She said to him: Give</b> it <b>to me. He said to her: If I give</b> it <b>to you will you be betrothed to me? She took it and was silent, and Rav Naḥman said: She could say: Yes, I took</b> it, but <b>I took my</b> property. There is no proof that she agreed to accept it as a betrothal.
<b>Rava raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If a man <b>betrothed</b> a woman <b>with</b> property that was taken <b>by robbery; or</b> with property taken <b>by a forced transaction,</b> when the owner was reluctant to sell, <b>or</b> with property that was taken <b>by theft; or if he grabbed a <i>sela</i> from her hand and betrothed her</b> with it, <b>she is betrothed.</b> If so, why does Rav Naḥman say here that when he took it from her and betrothed her she is not betrothed? Rav Naḥman answered: <b>There,</b> it is referring to a case where <b>he</b> had previously <b>arranged</b> to marry her, and therefore if she remained silent she certainly agreed to the betrothal.
<b>And from where do you say that there is a difference</b> between a case <b>where he</b> had previously <b>arranged</b> to marry her <b>and where he had not arranged</b> to do so? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that with regard to a man who <b>said to</b> a woman: <b>Take this <i>sela</i> that I owe you, and he went back and said to her: Be betrothed to me with it,</b> if he said this <b>at the time the money was given</b> and <b>she wanted</b> it, <b>she is betrothed;</b> if <b>she did not want</b> it, <b>she is not betrothed.</b> If he issued his statement <b>after</b> the <b>money was given,</b> then <b>even if she wanted</b> it, <b>she is not betrothed.</b>
Rav Naḥman clarifies: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>She wanted, and what</b> is the meaning of: <b>She did not want? If we say</b> that: <b>She wanted,</b> means <b>that she said yes,</b> and: <b>She did not want,</b> means that <b>she</b> explicitly <b>said no,</b> it can be inferred that if <b>she was silent it is</b> a valid <b>betrothal. But</b> if so, <b>let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> simply that <b>she is betrothed, without specification, as</b> it did <b>there</b> in the previous case, with regard to one who said: Take this <i>sela</i> as a deposit. It is obvious that if she explicitly said no, she is not betrothed.
<b>Rather,</b> the phrase: <b>She wanted,</b> means <b>she said yes,</b> and: <b>She did not want,</b> means <b>that she remained silent. And</b> in this case of silence the <i>baraita</i> <b>taught that she is not betrothed. What is the reason</b> that she is not betrothed if she remained silent? It is that <b>she can say: Yes I took</b> it, <b>but I took my own</b> property and did not intend to become betrothed.
<b>But this</b> is <b>difficult</b> with regard to <b>that</b> which we learned, that if a man <b>betrothed her with</b> property that was taken <b>by robbery, or</b> with property taken <b>by a forced transaction, or</b> with property that was taken <b>by theft, or if he grabbed a <i>sela</i> from her hand and betrothed her</b> with it, <b>she is betrothed. Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from it</b> that <b>this</b> ruling, that she is betrothed if she was silent, is referring to a case <b>where he arranged</b> the marriage beforehand, whereas <b>this</b> ruling, that she is not betrothed when she remained silent, is referring to a situation <b>where he did not arrange</b> it beforehand?
§ The Gemara relates: <b>When Rabbi Asi died, the Sages assembled to collect his statements,</b> i.e., they wished to review his rulings of <i>halakha</i> lest they be forgotten. <b>A certain</b> member <b>of the Sages, and Rabbi Ya’akov was his name, said to them: This</b> is what <b>Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Mani said: Just as a woman cannot be acquired by less than the value of one <i>peruta</i>, so</b> too <b>land cannot be acquired by less than the value of one <i>peruta</i>. They said to him: But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Although a woman cannot be acquired by less than the value of one <i>peruta</i>, land can be acquired by less than the value of one <i>peruta</i>?</b>
Rabbi Ya’akov <b>said to them: When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught</b> to the effect that land can be acquired by less than the value of one <i>peruta</i> but a woman cannot, it was <b>with regard to</b> acquisition through symbolic <b>exchange,</b> i.e., a legal act of acquisition formalizing the transfer of ownership of an article. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One can acquire</b> land and movable items through a symbolic exchange <b>by</b> giving <b>a vessel, even though it is not worth one <i>peruta</i>.</b>
<b>They then sat and said</b> additional statements in the name of Rabbi Asi. One statement concerned <b>that which Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Anyone who does not know the nature of bills of divorce and betrothals should have no dealings in them,</b> as his ignorance might lead people to commit serious sins. In this context, <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And</b> those who deal with these issues without proper knowledge <b>are worse for the world than the generation of the flood, as it is stated: “Swearing and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery. They break all bounds, and blood touches blood”</b> (Hosea 4:2).
The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred</b> that this verse is referring to individuals of this kind and that they are worse for the world than the generation of the flood? The Gemara explains: <b>As Rav Yosef translated</b> the phrase “and committing adultery, they break all bounds, and blood touches blood,” as: <b>They give birth to children through the wives of others; they add sins upon sins.</b>
<b>And it is written</b> in the next verse: <b>“Therefore the land mourns and everyone who dwells there languishes, with the beasts of the field and the fowls of heaven, and the fishes of the sea are also taken away”</b> (Hosea 4:3). This indicates that those who cause illegitimate children to be born lead to such a great tragedy that even the fish of the sea will die, <b>whereas in the generation of the flood the decree was not imposed upon the fish in the sea, as it is stated: “Whatever was on dry land died”</b> (Genesis 7:22). The explicit mention of dry land indicates that <b>the fish in the sea did not</b> die. <b>But here,</b> in the punishment described in the verses in Hosea, <b>even the fish in the sea</b> died.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that this punishment is not administered <b>until they perform all of them,</b> i.e., only if they commit all of the sins mentioned in the verse, including taking false oaths, committing murder, and stealing. The Gemara answers: It should <b>not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written: “For because of swearing the land mourns”</b> (Jeremiah 23:10). This verse teaches that on account of taking false oaths alone the world can be destroyed, from which it may be inferred that each these acts on its own is enough to warrant destruction.
The Gemara further asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that taking a false <b>oath is distinct,</b> as it involves the desecration of God’s name, <b>and these</b> other sins <b>are distinct,</b> i.e., they are less severe offenses that entail a less serious punishment. Therefore, it is possible that this great tragedy will result only if one performs all of them.

Daf 13b

The Gemara explains: <b>Is it written: And they break all bounds,</b> with the conjunction: And, which would indicate that all the sins are included as one unit? Rather, it <b>is written: “They break all bounds,”</b> from which it may be inferred that this punishment is given separately for each one of these sins.
§ <b>They then sat and said</b> additional statements in the name of Rav Asi, one of which concerned <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kinnim</i> 2:5): With regard to <b>a woman</b> after childbirth <b>who brought her sin-offering</b> for her ritual purification <b>and died, the heirs bring her burnt-offering</b> to fulfill her remaining sacrificial obligations. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: And</b> this <b>is</b> the <i>halakha</i> only <b>when</b> the woman herself had already <b>separated,</b> i.e., designated, the animal for the burnt-offering <b>in her lifetime. But</b> if she <b>had not separated it in her lifetime, no,</b> the heirs are not required to bring a burnt-offering on her behalf.
The Gemara concludes: <b>Apparently,</b> Shmuel <b>maintains</b> that the property of a debtor is <b>not liened by Torah law.</b> In other words, one does not say that because she was required to bring a burnt-offering there is a lien on her property and the debt must be paid even if she did not set aside the animal before her death. <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though she did not separate</b> the burnt-offering <b>in her lifetime. Apparently,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>maintains</b> that the property of a debtor is <b>liened by Torah law.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> these Sages already <b>disagreed about</b> this issue <b>once;</b> why would they engage in the same dispute with regard to multiple applications? <b>As Rav and Shmuel both say:</b> With regard to <b>a loan</b> granted <b>by oral</b> agreement, i.e., without a document that places a lien on the land, if the debtor dies, the creditor <b>cannot collect</b> the loan <b>from the heirs or from those who purchased</b> the land. This is the <i>halakha</i> even if it is clear that there was a loan and the debtors do not dispute this fact. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish both say:</b> With regard to <b>a loan by oral</b> agreement, the creditor can <b>collect from the heirs and from those who purchased</b> from the debtor. This shows that those same Sages already disagreed as to whether a lien on a property exists by Torah law in the absence of a document.
The Gemara answers: It is <b>necessary</b> to teach both cases <b>as, if</b> it <b>were stated</b> only <b>about this</b> case of a loan, one might say: It is only <b>with regard to this</b> situation <b>that Shmuel says</b> there is no lien on property, <b>because it is a loan that is not written in the Torah.</b> This loan is merely a private agreement between two individuals. <b>But with regard to this</b> obligation of a woman to bring a burnt-offering, one might <b>say</b> that <b>he concedes to Rabbi Yoḥanan and to Reish Lakish.</b> Since this woman’s obligation to bring a burnt-offering is written in the Torah, perhaps it creates a lien on her property despite the fact that there is no document to that effect.
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>had</b> the <i>amora’im</i> <b>taught us about</b> their dispute only in <b>this</b> case of the burnt-offering of a woman following childbirth, one might say that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that the Torah imposes a lien only in <b>this</b> case of the burnt-offering, as <b>a loan written in the Torah is like one written in a document. But with regard to this</b> private loan, one might <b>say</b> that <b>he concedes to Shmuel</b> that the lien does not apply by Torah law. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to state the dispute in both cases.
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is as follows: With regard to <b>a loan by oral</b> agreement, the creditor can <b>collect from the heirs but he cannot collect from those who purchased</b> from the debtor. The reason <b>he can collect from the heirs</b> is that the accepted opinion is that the property of a debtor is <b>liened by Torah law. But he cannot collect from those who purchased</b> from the debtor, because a loan by oral agreement <b>does not generate publicity,</b> i.e., people will not have heard about it. Therefore, they are not careful to avoid buying property from the debtor. These purchasers should not suffer due to a lien that was not well known.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> a woman <b>acquires herself through a bill of divorce or through the death of the husband.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a bill of divorce, as it is written</b> explicitly in the Torah: <b>“And he writes for her a scroll of severance,</b> and gives it in her hand, and sends her out of his house; and she departs out of his house and she goes and becomes another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:1–2). This indicates that a bill of divorce enables a woman to marry whomever she wishes after the divorce.
<b>But from where do we</b> derive that <b>the death of the husband</b> also enables a woman to remarry? The Gemara answers: This <b>is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning: He,</b> the husband, <b>rendered her forbidden</b> to every man, <b>and he</b> has <b>permitted her.</b> Since the husband is no longer alive, there is no one who renders her forbidden.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> consider the status of <b>those with whom relations are forbidden, as he renders</b> her <b>forbidden to them, and</b> yet he <b>does not permit</b> her <b>to them</b> when he dies. For example, one may not marry one’s father’s wife even after the father dies. <b>Rather, from</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One states</b> that <b>a <i>yevama</i> who does not have children</b> from her deceased husband <b>is prohibited</b> from marrying anyone besides the <i>yavam</i>, it may be inferred that a widow <b>who has children</b> from her deceased husband <b>is permitted</b> to remarry.
The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> one should infer the following from that <i>halakha</i>: A woman who <b>does not have children</b> from her deceased husband <b>is forbidden to everyone and permitted to the <i>yavam</i>, and</b> a woman who <b>has children</b> from her deceased husband <b>is forbidden to everyone also. Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the death of the husband permits a woman to marry another man is derived <b>from</b> the fact that <b>the Merciful One states</b> that <b>a widow is forbidden to a High Priest.</b> This indicates that it is <b>permitted</b> for her <b>to</b> marry <b>a common priest,</b> and the same certainly applies to a non-priest.
The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> one can say that she is forbidden <b>to a High Priest by a prohibition,</b> whereas she is forbidden <b>to everyone else</b> only <b>by</b> dint of <b>a positive mitzva.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>This positive mitzva, what is its purpose? If the death of the husband affects</b> her status, <b>she should be entirely permitted,</b> and <b>if the death of the husband does not affect</b> her status <b>she remains in her initial state</b> when her husband was alive, and therefore those who engage in sexual intercourse with her would be liable to receive the death penalty.
The Gemara answers: And <b>why</b> is this suggestion <b>not</b> considered reasonable? One could argue that the death of the husband <b>removed her from</b> the class of people with whom one is punished with <b>death</b> for engaging in intercourse, <b>and placed her in</b> the class of people with whom one is prohibited to engage in intercourse due to <b>a positive mitzva, just as it is with consecrated</b> animals <b>that have been disqualified.</b> This is referring to animals that were designated as offerings but became invalid due to some blemish.
The Gemara explains: The <i>halakha</i> with regard to such animals is <b>that initially,</b> when they are unblemished, <b>they are subject</b> to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse,</b> i.e., if one benefited from them he has misused consecrated items. <b>And</b> likewise <b>shearing</b> them and performing <b>labor</b> with them <b>is prohibited.</b> Once these animals have developed a blemish and <b>one has redeemed them,</b> the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated items <b>does not apply to them,</b> but <b>shearing</b> them and performing <b>labor</b> with them remains <b>prohibited.</b> Based on this example, it is possible that the death of the husband does not render the woman entirely permitted. If so, one cannot derive from here that it is permitted for a wife whose husband has passed away to marry another man.
<b>Rather,</b> the source that a widow may remarry is <b>from that</b> which <b>the verse states: “Lest he die in battle and another man take her”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:7). This indicates that a man may marry a widow. <b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, objects to this:</b> One can <b>say: Who is</b> this <b>other</b> man mentioned by the verse? It is <b>a <i>yavam</i>.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> that there are <b>two refutations of</b> this <b>statement: First, a <i>yavam</i> is not called “another,”</b> as his relationship with her is not entirely separate from that of the first husband. <b>And furthermore, it is written: “And the latter husband hates her, and writes her a scroll of severance and gives it in her hand and sends her out of his house, or if the latter husband dies”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:3). In this manner the verse <b>juxtaposes death to divorce: Just as divorce permits</b> a woman to everyone <b>and completes</b> the severing of a husband from his wife, thereby allowing her to marry another man, <b>so too, death permits</b> her <b>and completes</b> the severing, allowing her to marry another man.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And a <i>yevama</i></b> can be <b>acquired</b> by the deceased husband’s brother, the <i>yavam</i>, only <b>through intercourse.</b> And she acquires herself through <i>ḥalitza</i> or through the death of the <i>yavam</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that she can be acquired <b>through intercourse? The verse states:</b>

Daf 14a

<b>“Her brother-in-law will engage in sexual intercourse with her and take her to him as a wife,</b> and perform levirate marriage with her” (Deuteronomy 25:5), which indicates that intercourse renders her his wife. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that <b>with regard to all matters</b> she is <b>like a wife,</b> and therefore she can also be acquired with money or a document like any other woman. The Gemara answers: It could <b>not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>money and a document can complete</b> the acquisition of a <i>yevama</i> and cause her to be married, <b>in the manner that intercourse completes</b> her acquisition. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And perform levirate marriage with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), which indicates that only <b>intercourse completes her</b> acquisition, <b>but money or a document do not complete her</b> acquisition.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say: What</b> is the meaning of: <b>“And perform levirate marriage with her”?</b> It teaches <b>that he can perform levirate marriage without her consent,</b> as unlike an ordinary marriage, a levirate marriage does not require the woman’s agreement. The Gemara answers: <b>If so, let the verse say: And perform levirate marriage,</b> and one would understand that the matter depends entirely on him. <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>“And perform levirate marriage with her”? Learn two</b> conclusions <b>from this:</b> First, that a levirate marriage can be performed against her will, and second, that the only way to acquire a <i>yevama</i> is through sexual intercourse.
§ The mishna teaches that the <i>yevama</i> acquires herself <b>through <i>ḥalitza</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written</b> with regard to levirate marriage, after the <i>yavam</i> has performed <i>ḥalitza</i>: <b>“And his name shall be called in Israel: The house of him who had his shoe removed”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:10). This indicates: <b>Once</b> his <b>shoe is removed by her, she is permitted to all of Israel.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> term <b>“Israel,” does it come</b> to teach <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>It is required for that which is taught</b> by <b>Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda:</b> The verse says <b>“in Israel”</b> to teach that <i>ḥalitza</i> may be performed only <b>in a Jewish court, but not in a gentile court.</b> The Gemara answers that the phrase <b>“in Israel” is written twice</b> in that chapter: “And his name shall be called in Israel” (Deuteronomy 25:10), and: “To establish a name for his brother in Israel” (Deuteronomy 25:7). A different <i>halakha</i> is derived from each of these instances.
The Gemara asks: <b>But still, we</b> also <b>require</b> the additional term “in Israel” <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: Once we were sitting before Rabbi Tarfon and a <i>yevama</i> came to perform <i>ḥalitza</i>. And</b> Rabbi Tarfon <b>said to us</b> after the <i>ḥalitza</i>: <b>All of you</b> should <b>answer and say: The one whose shoe was removed, the one whose shoe was removed.</b> This indicates that the phrase: “And his name shall be called in Israel” (Deuteronomy 25:10), teaches that the matter must be announced and publicized throughout the nation. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i> is not derived from the phrase “in Israel.” Rather, <b>it is derived from: “And his name shall be called,”</b> which indicates that it must be announced that this is his name.
§ The mishna further teaches that a <i>yevama</i> is released from levirate marriage and may remarry <b>through the death of the <i>yavam</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers that it is <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If,</b> with regard to <b>a married woman, who is</b> forbidden to other men by a prohibition punished <b>with strangulation,</b> and yet <b>the death of her husband renders her permitted,</b> is <b>it not all the more so</b> that with regard to <b>a <i>yevama</i>, who is</b> forbidden to other men while the <i>yavam</i> is alive <b>by</b> only a mere <b>prohibition,</b> that the death of the <i>yavam</i> should render her permitted?
The Gemara raises a difficulty against this <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about a married woman</b> is <b>that she can leave through a bill of divorce</b> as well. Will <b>you say</b> the same <b>with regard to this</b> <i>yevama</i>, <b>who does not leave through a bill of divorce?</b> The Gemara answers: This is an insufficient refutation of the <i>a fortiori</i> inference, as <b>this</b> <i>yevama</i> <b>also leaves through <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> which serves the same function as a bill of divorce.
<b>Rather,</b> one can challenge this <i>a fortiori</i> inference in the following manner. <b>What</b> is unique <b>about a married woman</b> is <b>that</b> the one who <b>renders her forbidden</b> to everyone else, i.e., her husband, also <b>renders her permitted</b> when he dies. This is not so with regard to a <i>yevama</i>, as she is rendered forbidden upon the death of her husband. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> With regard to <b>this</b> <i>yevama</i> <b>as well,</b> he who <b>renders her forbidden</b> is also the one who <b>renders her permitted:</b> The <b><i>yavam</i> renders her forbidden,</b> because if he was not alive she would automatically be permitted to other men. Likewise, the <b><i>yavam</i> renders her permitted</b> through <i>ḥalitza</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>And let a married woman leave</b> a marriage <b>through <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> as derived <b>by an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If a <i>yevama</i>, who cannot leave through a bill of divorce, can leave through <i>ḥalitza</i>, is it not logical</b> that <b>this</b> married woman, <b>who can leave through a bill of divorce, can</b> likewise <b>leave through <i>ḥalitza</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to a married woman: <b>“A scroll of severance”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:3), which indicates that <b>a scroll,</b> i.e., a written document, <b>severs her</b> from her husband <b>and nothing else severs her</b> from him. While the husband is alive only a bill of divorce can dissolve a marriage.
The Gemara further asks: <b>And let a <i>yevama</i> leave through a bill of divorce,</b> as derived <b>by an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If a married woman, who cannot leave through <i>ḥalitza</i>, can leave through a bill of divorce, is it not logical</b> that <b>this</b> <i>yevama</i>, <b>who can leave through <i>ḥalitza</i>, can</b> also <b>leave through a bill of divorce?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states: “So</b> shall it be done to the man” (Deuteronomy 25:9), with regard to the <i>ḥalitza</i> of a <i>yevama</i>, <b>and “so” precludes</b> another option.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it true that <b>anywhere that there is</b> a term that <b>precludes</b> another option <b>one cannot learn an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference? <b>But there is</b> the case of the designation of the goats on <b>Yom Kippur, as it is written:</b> “The goat upon which the <b>lot</b> came up for the Lord” (Leviticus 16:9), <b>and:</b> “This shall be an everlasting <b>statute</b> to you” (Leviticus 16:34), which indicates that everything stated with regard to the mitzvot of Yom Kippur is critical to the performance of the service of the day.
<b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: “Aaron shall bring forward the goat upon which the lot came up for the Lord, <b>and he shall offer it for a sin-offering”</b> (Leviticus 16:9). The verse indicates that <b>the lottery renders</b> it <b>a sin-offering,</b> but <b>a verbal designation</b> of the goat with the status of a sin-offering <b>does not render</b> it <b>a sin-offering.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: A verse is necessary to teach this <i>halakha</i>, <b>as</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that the opposite conclusion is correct: Could this <b>not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference,</b> as follows: <b>Just as in a case in which</b> the use of <b>a lottery does not effect the consecration</b> of the animals with a specific designation, e.g., with regard to a woman who has given birth and must bring two birds, one as a sin-offering and one as a burnt-offering, and nevertheless <b>a verbal designation</b> of the animals with the required status <b>does effect the consecration</b> of them, so too, in <b>a case in which</b> the use of <b>a lottery does effect the consecration</b> of the animals, <b>is it not</b> logically <b>right that a verbal designation</b> of the animals with the required status <b>should effect the consecration</b> of them?
To counter this reasoning, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the goat: <b>“He shall offer it for a sin-offering”</b> (Leviticus 16:9), to indicate that <b>the lottery renders</b> it <b>a sin-offering, but a verbal designation</b> of the goat with the status of a sin-offering <b>does not render</b> it <b>a sin-offering. And the reason</b> that a verbal designation is ineffective <b>is that the verse excluded</b> this possibility, from which it may be inferred <b>that if it were not so, one would learn an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, <b>even though it is written with regard to it “statute.”</b> The same logic should apply in the case of <i>ḥalitza</i>, i.e., the term “so” should not prevent one from learning an <i>a fortiori</i> inference, and therefore it might be argued that a <i>yevama</i> can be released through a bill of divorce.
Rather, the Gemara explains that here too, there is a limitation derived from a verse. <b>The verse states</b> with regard to a bill of divorce: “And write <b>for her</b> a scroll of severance” (Deuteronomy 24:3). <b>“For her”</b> is a limitation, which teaches: A bill of divorce is effective for a regular woman <b>but not for a <i>yevama</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that the phrase <b>“for her”</b> indicates that the bill of divorce must be written <b>for her sake.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>“For her” is written twice</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1, 3), and therefore both <i>halakhot</i> can be derived. The Gemara asks: <b>And still, one</b> instance of: <b>“For her” is required</b> to teach that the bill of divorce must be written <b>for her sake, and the other “for her”</b> is needed to teach: For her <b>and not</b> both <b>for her and for another,</b> i.e., her rival wife. One bill of divorce cannot be used for two women.
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara suggests a different explanation as to why a bill of divorce is ineffective for a <i>yevama</i>. With regard to a <i>yevama</i> <b>the verse states:</b> “The house of him who had his <b>shoe</b> removed” (Deuteronomy 25:10), which teaches: If she is released by the <i>ḥalitza</i> of the <b>shoe, yes,</b> she is released from the <i>yavam</i>, but if she was released by means of <b>something else, no,</b> she is not released.
The Gemara asks: <b>But this</b> term <b>“shoe,” does it come</b> to teach <b>this? It is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse said: “And remove <b>his shoe”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>his shoe</b> may be used. <b>From where</b> do I derive that the <b>shoe of any person</b> may also be used for <i>ḥalitza</i>?
<b>The verse states “shoe,”</b> and states again in the next verse <b>“shoe,”</b> which <b>includes</b> any other shoe. <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “his shoe,”</b> which is apparently referring to the shoe of that particular man? This teaches that it must be <b>his shoe that is fit for him, excluding</b> a shoe so <b>large that he cannot walk in it,</b> and <b>excluding</b> a shoe so <b>small that it does not cover most of his foot,</b> and <b>excluding</b>

Daf 14b

<b>sandals [<i>mesulayim</i>] that have no heels,</b> which do not qualify as shoes. The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> that the term is stated only for that purpose, <b>let the verse write “shoe.” What</b> is the meaning of <b>“the shoe”? Learn</b> the <b>two</b> previously stated conclusions <b>from it.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A Hebrew slave</b> can be <b>acquired</b> by his master <b>through money or through a document, and</b> he can <b>acquire himself,</b> i.e., he is emancipated, <b>through years,</b> i.e., when he completes his six years of labor, <b>or through the</b> advent of the <b>Jubilee</b> Year, <b>or through the deduction of money.</b> The slave can redeem himself during the six years by paying for his remaining years of slavery. <b>A Hebrew maidservant</b> has one mode of emancipation <b>more than him, as she acquires herself through signs</b> indicating puberty. A slave <b>who is pierced</b> after serving six years is <b>acquired</b> as a slave for a longer period <b>through piercing</b> his ear with an awl, <b>and</b> he <b>acquires himself through the</b> advent of the <b>Jubilee</b> Year <b>or through</b> the <b>death of the master.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that <b>a Hebrew slave</b> can be <b>acquired through money.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers that the <b>verse states: “Out of the money that he was bought for”</b> (Leviticus 25:51), which <b>teaches</b> that he can be <b>acquired through money.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> that <b>a Hebrew slave who is sold to a gentile</b> is acquired with money, which is the case discussed in that verse, but this proves nothing with regard to a Jew sold to a Jew. One could argue that <b>since all of the acquisitions</b> of a gentile are performed only <b>with money,</b> he can likewise purchase a Hebrew slave with money.
But <b>from where do we</b> derive that a Hebrew slave can be <b>sold to a Jew</b> with money? The Gemara explains that with regard to a Hebrew maidservant, the <b>verse states:</b> “Then he shall let her <b>be redeemed”</b> (Exodus 21:8), which <b>teaches</b> that if she acquires money and wishes to be emancipated before her time is complete, she <b>deducts</b> a sum <b>from her redemption.</b> The maidservant can deduct the value of time served from her purchase price and pay the remaining amount, and she then <b>is emancipated.</b> This teaches that a Hebrew maidservant is acquired through money, a <i>halakha</i> that applies to a male slave as well.
The Gemara asks: Although <b>we found</b> this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a Hebrew maidservant,</b> one cannot extrapolate from there to this case, as it is possible that it applies only to a female. The reason for this is that <b>since</b> she is ordinarily <b>betrothed through money,</b> she can also be <b>acquired</b> as a maidservant <b>through money. From where do we</b> derive that <b>a Hebrew slave</b> can likewise be acquired through money? The Gemara answers that the <b>verse states: “If your brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman is sold to you, and he shall serve you six years”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:12). This verse <b>juxtaposes a Hebrew man to a Hebrew woman,</b> indicating that the modes through which they are acquired are the same.
The Gemara further asks: <b>We found</b> a source in this verse for <b>a slave who is sold by the court.</b> This verse is referring to a thief who is unable to repay the value of his theft and is sold as a slave so that he can repay his debt. One can therefore argue that this case is unique, <b>since</b> he is <b>sold against his will. From where do we</b> derive that one who <b>sells himself</b> can be sold through money?
The Gemara answers: One <b>derives</b> this through a verbal analogy between the terms <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker.”</b> This term appears both with regard to one who sells himself: “As a hired worker and as a settler he shall be with you” (Leviticus 25:40), and with regard to one who is sold by the court: “For double of the hire of a hired worker he has served you” (Deuteronomy 15:18). The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who</b> derives this verbal analogy between the terms <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker.” But according to the one who does not derive</b> the verbal analogy between <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker,” what can be said?</b> From where does he derive that one who sells himself may be purchased with money?
The Gemara answers: The <b>verse states</b> at the start of the passage dealing with one sold to a gentile: <b>“And if</b> a stranger who is a settler with you <b>becomes rich”</b> (Leviticus 25:47). The conjunction “and” serves to <b>add to the first matter,</b> i.e., the passage discussing one who sells himself to a Jew, as it joins the two issues. And therefore <b>let the above case</b> of one who sells himself to a Jew <b>be derived from the case below</b> of one who is sold to a gentile: Just as one who is sold to a gentile can be acquired with money, so too, one who sells himself to a Jew can be acquired with money.
The Gemara comments: <b>And who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> <b>who does not derive</b> the verbal analogy between <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker”? It is this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught in</b> a <i>baraita</i>: One who <b>sells himself</b> as a slave <b>is sold for six</b> years, <b>and</b> if he wishes he can be sold for <b>more than six</b> years, whereas one who is <b>sold by the court is sold only for six</b> years, but no more.
The <i>baraita</i> adds that there are additional differences between these two slaves: <b>One who sells himself may not be pierced</b> with an awl, whereas one who is <b>sold by the court may be pierced</b> with an awl. One who <b>sells himself is not granted</b> a severance gift by his master when he is emancipated, whereas one who is <b>sold by the court is granted</b> a severance gift. With regard to <b>one who sells himself, his master may not provide him</b> with <b>a Canaanite maidservant</b> as a wife to produce slave children, whereas with regard to one <b>sold by the court, his master may provide him</b> with <b>a Canaanite maidservant.</b>
<b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that there is no difference between these two types of slaves. Rather, both <b>this</b> slave <b>and that</b> slave may be <b>sold for only six</b> years; both <b>this and that</b> one may be <b>pierced</b> with an awl, both <b>this and that</b> one <b>are granted</b> a severance gift, and in both <b>this</b> case <b>and that</b> case <b>his master may provide him</b> with <b>a Canaanite maidservant. What, is it not</b> the case that <b>they disagree with regard to this, that the first <i>tanna</i> does not derive</b> the verbal analogy between <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker,” and Rabbi Elazar derives</b> the verbal analogy between <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker”?</b> If one holds that the two cases are juxtaposed, one will equate the <i>halakhot</i> of both slaves. This is the opinion of Rabbi Elazar, in contrast to the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i>, who holds that the <i>halakhot</i> of each type of slave are discrete.
<b>Rav Tavyumei said in the name of Abaye:</b> That is not so; rather, <b>everyone derives</b> the verbal analogy between <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker,” and here,</b> in the dispute in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>they disagree about this</b> following <b>verse. What is the reasoning</b> of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>, who says</b> that one who <b>sells himself is sold for six</b> years <b>and more than six</b> years? He maintains that with regard to one <b>sold by the court, the Merciful One excludes</b> a certain case by the verse: “If your brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, is sold to you, <b>and he shall serve you six years”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:12). That teaches that only <b>this</b> type of slave serves for six years and no more, but the same does <b>not</b> apply to one who <b>sells himself.</b> If he so stipulates, he may serve for more than six years.
The Gemara explains: <b>And the other,</b> Rabbi Elazar, learns a different <i>halakha</i> from this verse. <b>“And he shall serve you”</b> means that he works <b>for you and not for an heir</b> other than a son. If a master has no sons, his slave is not transferred as an inheritance to a daughter or to a brother like his other property. If he does have sons, they inherit a Hebrew slave.
The Gemara asks: <b>And the other,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, from where does he derive that a slave is not transferred as an inheritance? The Gemara answers that the phrase, <b>“And he shall serve you,”</b> is <b>written another</b> time, and he derives this <i>halakha</i> from there. The Gemara asks: <b>And the other,</b> Rabbi Elazar, what does he do with that other verse? The Gemara answers: In his opinion <b>that</b> verse <b>comes to appease the master.</b> The verse emphasizes that the servitude is of limited duration to encourage the master to free the slave without hesitation.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of the first <i>tanna</i>, who says</b> that one who <b>sells himself is not pierced</b> with an awl? The Gemara answers: He derives this <b>from</b> the fact that <b>with regard to one sold by the court, the Merciful One excludes</b> a certain case by the verse: <b>“And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl”</b> (Exodus 21:6), which teaches: <b>His ear,</b> of this slave, <b>and not the ear of</b> a slave who <b>sells himself.</b>

Daf 15a

<b>And the other</b> Sage, Rabbi Elazar, would say: <b>That</b> term, “his ear,” <b>comes for a verbal analogy. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: From where</b> is it derived that the <b>piercing</b> of a Hebrew slave’s ear with an awl is performed <b>on the right ear? It is stated: Ear, here,</b> with regard to a Hebrew slave, <b>and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the ritual purification of a leper: “The right <b>ear</b> of he who is to be purified” (Leviticus 14:14). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to a leper, it specifies the <b>right</b> ear explicitly, <b>so too here,</b> the piercing of a slave must be performed on the <b>right</b> ear.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>the other</b> Sage, the first <i>tanna</i>, derive that this piercing can be performed only on the right ear? The Gemara answers: He would argue that <b>if it is so</b> that the word “ear” is stated only for the sake of the verbal analogy, <b>let the verse say</b> merely: <b>Ear,</b> and one would learn the <i>halakha</i> through a verbal analogy from the case of the leper’s ear. <b>What</b> is the reason that it states <b>“his ear”?</b> This serves to teach that one who sells himself may not be pierced.
<b>And the other</b> Sage, Rabbi Elazar, would answer: <b>That</b> formulation <b>is necessary</b> to teach that the mitzva of piercing applies to <b>“his ear” but not her ear.</b> He learns from the pronoun that piercing may be performed only on a male slave, not a maidservant. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> from where does <b>the other</b> Sage, the first <i>tanna</i>, derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> the verse: <b>“But if the slave shall say”</b> (Exodus 21:5). This indicates that piercing applies to <b>the slave but not</b> to <b>a maidservant.</b>
<b>And the other</b> Sage, Rabbi Elazar, who does not derive this ruling in the same manner as the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>requires</b> this verse for a different <i>halakha</i>: A slave may declare that he wishes to be pierced <b>provided that he says</b> this <b>when he is</b> still <b>a slave.</b> After he has been emancipated, he can no longer say that he wishes to remain with his master.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> from where does <b>the other</b> Sage, the first <i>tanna</i>, learn this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara responds: <b>He derives</b> it <b>from</b> the terms: <b>Slave,</b> and <b>“the slave.”</b> If the verse had stated only: Slave, one would have learned that a slave may say this only while still a slave. Since it is actually written “the slave,” this teaches the other <i>halakha</i> as well, that a slave may be pierced but a maidservant may not. The Gemara comments: <b>And the other</b> Sage, Rabbi Elazar, <b>does not learn</b> a <i>halakha</i> from this slight difference between: <b>Slave,</b> and <b>“the slave.”</b>
The Gemara clarifies additional details with regard to this dispute: <b>What is the reasoning of the first <i>tanna</i>, who says</b> that <b>one does not grant</b> a severance gift <b>to one who sells himself? With regard to one sold by the court, the Merciful One excludes</b> a certain case by the verse: <b>“You shall give a severance gift to him”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:14). <b>“To him”</b> means to one who is sold by the court, <b>but not to one who sells himself.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>the other</b> Sage, Rabbi Elazar, derive from that verse? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires that</b> verse to teach the following: <b>“To him”</b> means that one grants a severance gift only to the slave himself <b>but not to his heirs.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why not</b> give this gift <b>to his heirs?</b> After all, <b>the Merciful One calls</b> a Hebrew slave <b>“a hired worker.” Just as</b> payment for <b>the labor of a hired worker</b> is given <b>to his heirs</b> when he dies, <b>so too this</b> severance gift for <b>his labor</b> should be given <b>to his heirs</b> when he dies. <b>Rather,</b> this verse teaches <b>“to him,” but not to</b> the slave’s <b>creditor.</b> One to whom the slave owes money may not collect the slave’s severance gift as repayment of the debt.
The Gemara asks: Why is it necessary to emphasize that a creditor has no rights to the severance gift? That is necessary due to the fact <b>that we generally hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Natan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> in the case of <b>one who lends one hundred dinars to another, and the other</b> lends a similar sum <b>to</b> yet <b>another,</b> a third person, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the court <b>appropriates</b> the money <b>from this one,</b> the third person, <b>and gives</b> it <b>to that one,</b> the first creditor, without going through the second person, who owes money to the first and is owed that same amount by the third? <b>The verse states: “And he shall give it to him whom he has wronged”</b> (Numbers 5:7), which indicates that the loan should be repaid to the creditor to whom the money is ultimately owed.
Therefore, the term <b>“to him” comes to exclude</b> this possibility, as the severance gift is given to the slave and not to his creditor. <b>And</b> how does <b>the other</b> Sage, the first <i>tanna</i>, respond to this claim? He maintains that <b>we generally do not hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan.</b> Consequently, this exposition is unnecessary.
The Gemara continues to ask: <b>What is the reasoning of the first <i>tanna</i>, who says</b> that if <b>one sells himself his master does not provide him</b> with <b>a Canaanite maidservant?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>With regard to one sold by the court, the Merciful One excludes</b> a certain case by the verse: <b>“If his master give to him a wife”</b> (Exodus 21:4). This serves to emphasize <b>“to him” but not to one who sells himself. And the other</b> Sage, Rabbi Elazar, explains: <b>“To him”</b> means even <b>against his will.</b>
<b>And</b> from where does <b>the other</b> Sage, the first <i>tanna</i>, derive that the slave must remain with this maidservant against his will? <b>He derives</b> it <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“For double of the hire of a hired worker</b> he has served you” (Deuteronomy 15:18). <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that this verse: <b>“For double of the hire of a hired worker he has served you,”</b> indicates that <b>a hired worker works only during the day,</b> whereas <b>a Hebrew slave works both during the day and at night.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>And can it enter your mind that a Hebrew slave</b> actually <b>works both during the day and at night? But isn’t it already stated: “Because he fares well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:16), which teaches that he must be <b>with you in food</b> and <b>with you in drink?</b> All of the slave’s needs must be fulfilled, and his living conditions must be equal to those of the master himself. If so, he cannot be forced to work under unreasonable conditions. <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> in explanation of this <i>halakha</i>: <b>From here</b> it is derived <b>that his master may provide him</b> with <b>a Canaanite maidservant</b> against his will to produce children for the master. This is the service he performs at night.
<b>And the other</b> Sage, Rabbi Elazar, would say that this is no proof, because <b>if</b> it is derived <b>from there</b> alone <b>I would say: This matter applies</b> only <b>with his consent; but</b> as for his master forcing him to live with a maidservant <b>against his will, I would say no,</b> he cannot do this. Therefore, the term “to him” <b>teaches us</b> that the master can even provide him with a Canaanite maidservant against his will.
§ According to the above explanation, both Rabbi Elazar and the first <i>tanna</i> accept the verbal analogy between “hired worker” and “hired worker.” <b>Rather, who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who <b>does not derive</b> the verbal analogy between <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker”? It is this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> as follows with regard to the verse: “He shall labor with you until the Jubilee Year, then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him, <b>and shall return to his own family</b> and to the possession of his fathers he shall return” (Leviticus 25:40–41). <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: What is the verse speaking of</b> when it states: “And shall return to his own family”? <b>If</b> it is speaking <b>of one who sold himself</b> and the Jubilee Year arrived during his six years of slavery, this <b>is already stated:</b> “He shall labor with you until the Jubilee Year, then he shall go out from you” (Leviticus 25:40).
<b>If</b> it is speaking <b>of a pierced</b> slave, it <b>is already stated,</b> as will be explained. It must be that <b>the verse is speaking of nothing other</b> than a man <b>sold by the court two or three years before the Jubilee</b> Year, and it teaches <b>that the Jubilee</b> Year <b>releases him</b> from slavery. The Gemara analyzes this opinion: <b>And if</b> it would <b>enter your mind</b> that Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov <b>derives</b> the verbal analogy between <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker,” why do I</b> need this verse? <b>Let him derive</b> that a man sold by the court is released in the Jubilee Year by the verbal analogy between <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker,”</b> from the case of one who sold himself.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that this claim can be refuted: <b>Actually,</b> Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov <b>derives</b> the verbal analogy between <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker”</b> as well, <b>and</b> even so it <b>was necessary</b> for him to learn that <i>halakha</i> from a verse. The reason is that it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>one who sells himself, who did not commit a transgression,</b> is emancipated at the onset of the Jubilee Year even if six years have not passed, <b>but</b> with regard to <b>one sold by the court, who did commit a transgression,</b> as he was sold because he was unable to repay the value of his theft, one might <b>say</b> that <b>we should penalize him</b> and therefore he should not be emancipated in the Jubilee Year. Consequently, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that even this slave is emancipated in the Jubilee Year.
<b>The Master said</b> earlier, in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> it is speaking <b>about a pierced</b> slave, it <b>is already stated.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the verse that teaches that a pierced slave is released in the Jubilee Year? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“And you shall return, each man to his land, and</b> you shall return, <b>each man to his family”</b> (Leviticus 25:10). <b>What is the verse speaking of? If</b> it is speaking <b>of one who sells himself,</b> it <b>is already stated:</b> “He shall labor with you until the Jubilee Year” (Leviticus 25:40).
<b>If</b> it is speaking <b>of one who was sold by the court,</b> it <b>is already stated:</b> “Then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him, and shall return to his own family” (Leviticus 25:41). It must be that <b>the verse is speaking of nothing other</b> than a slave <b>who is pierced two or three years before the Jubilee</b> Year, and <b>that the Jubilee</b> Year <b>releases him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred</b> that the verse is specifically referring to a pierced slave? <b>Rava bar Sheila said</b> that <b>the verse states “man.” What matter applies to a man and does not apply to a woman? You must say</b> that <b>this is piercing</b> a Hebrew slave’s ear with an awl.
The Gemara comments: <b>And it was necessary</b> for the Torah <b>to write</b> that <b>one sold by the court</b> leaves in the Jubilee Year, <b>and it was</b> also <b>necessary to write</b> the same with regard to <b>a pierced</b> slave, as neither case can be derived from the other. The Gemara elaborates: <b>As, if</b> the Torah had <b>informed us</b> only about <b>one who was sold by the court,</b> one might say that the Jubilee Year releases him <b>because his time had not come</b> to be freed. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a pierced</b> slave, <b>whose time had come</b> but he did not wish to be freed, one might <b>say</b> that <b>we should penalize him</b> and he should remain a permanent slave.
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if</b> the Torah had <b>informed us</b> only about a <b>pierced</b> slave, one might say that the Jubilee Year releases him <b>because he has served</b> the master <b>for six</b> years, as required, <b>but</b> with regard to <b>one who was sold by the court,</b> who <b>has not</b> yet <b>served</b> his master <b>for six</b> years, one might <b>say</b> that he should <b>not</b> be freed in the Jubilee Year. Therefore, <b>it was necessary</b> for the Torah to state this <i>halakha</i> with regard to both cases.
<b>And</b> likewise, <b>it was necessary</b> for the Torah <b>to write</b> with regard to the release of a pierced slave in the Jubilee Year: <b>“And you shall return,</b> each man to his land” (Leviticus 25:10), <b>and it was necessary to write</b> as well: “And he shall serve him <b>forever”</b> (Exodus 21:6), which is interpreted by the Sages as referring to until the Jubilee Year. <b>As, if the Merciful One</b> had <b>written</b> only <b>“forever,” I would say</b> that this <b>actually</b> means <b>forever,</b> i.e., for his entire life. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “And you shall return.”</b>
<b>And if the Merciful One</b> had <b>written</b> only <b>“and you shall return,” I would say</b> that <b>this statement applies</b> only <b>where he did not serve six</b> years after being pierced; <b>but</b> in a case <b>where he did serve six</b> years after he was pierced, one might argue as follows: <b>His final</b> stage, after he is pierced, <b>should not be stricter than his initial</b> stage, when he was first sold: <b>Just as</b> after <b>his initial</b> stage he serves only <b>six</b> years, <b>so too</b> in <b>his final</b> stage he serves only <b>six</b> years and no longer. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us “forever,”</b> which means <b>forever until the Jubilee</b> Year, even if the Jubilee Year arrives many years later. In any case, with regard to the issue at hand there is no proof that Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov does not derive the verbal analogy between “hired worker” and “hired worker.”
<b>Rather, who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who <b>does not derive</b> the verbal analogy between <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker”? It is Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:

Daf 15b

A Hebrew slave sold to a gentile can be redeemed by his relatives, as it is stated: <b>“And if he is not redeemed by any of these,</b> then he shall go out in the Jubilee Year” (Leviticus 25:54). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: He can be redeemed</b> only <b>through these,</b> i.e., the assistance of his relatives, <b>and he is not redeemed after six</b> years of labor.
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi elaborates: <b>As I might have</b> argued that one sold to a gentile should be released after six years. Could this <b>not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference: If one who cannot be redeemed by these</b> relatives, i.e., a Hebrew slave who was sold to a Jew, as he cannot be redeemed by his rela-tives, nevertheless <b>is redeemed after six</b> years of labor, <b>is it not logical</b> that <b>this</b> Hebrew slave sold to a gentile, <b>who can be redeemed by these</b> relatives, <b>can</b> likewise <b>be redeemed after six</b> years of work? Therefore, <b>the verse states “by any of these,”</b> to emphasize that one sold to a gentile <b>can be redeemed</b> only <b>through these</b> relatives, <b>and he cannot be redeemed after six</b> years.
The Gemara explains the proof: <b>And if it enters your mind that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>derives</b> the verbal analogy between <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker,” why</b> does he <b>say: If one who cannot be redeemed by these,</b> with regard to one who is sold to a Jew? <b>Let him derive</b> that <i>halakha</i> from the case of one sold to a gentile, through the verbal analogy between <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker.”</b> The term “hired worker” is used in reference to one sold to a gentile as well: “As a hired worker year by year he shall be with him” (Leviticus 25:53), and accordingly one can say that even one sold to a Jew can be redeemed by his relatives. The fact that he does not accept this claim indicates that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi rejects the verbal analogy between “hired worker” and “hired worker.”
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This proof can be refuted, as one can say that <b>actually</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>does derive</b> the verbal analogy between <b>“hired worker”</b> and <b>“hired worker,” and it is different here,</b> with regard to one sold to a gentile, <b>as the verse states:</b> “Either his uncle or his uncle’s son <b>may redeem him”</b> (Leviticus 25:49). This emphasis of “him” teaches that redemption is an option only <b>for this</b> slave <b>and not for another</b> type of slave.
With regard to the dispute itself the Gemara inquires: <b>And who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who <b>disagrees with Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi with regard to this? It is <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and Rabbi Akiva. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the verse: “And if <b>he is not redeemed by any of these”</b> (Leviticus 25:54), that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says:</b> The expression <b>“by any of these”</b> indicates that redemption by one’s relatives is <b>to freedom,</b> i.e., one becomes an entirely free man. But if a slave is redeemed <b>by anyone else</b> who pays the gentile master, it is <b>to slavery.</b> The redeemed slave becomes indentured to his redeemer until he repays the cost of his redemption through his work. <b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> the opposite: <b>By these</b> relatives he is redeemed <b>to slavery,</b> whereas if he is redeemed <b>by anyone else,</b> it is <b>to freedom.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili? The verse states</b> concerning a redeemed slave who is emancipated: <b>“If he is not redeemed by any of these”</b> relatives; <b>but</b> if he is redeemed <b>by another, “then he shall go out in the Jubilee Year,”</b> not earlier, as he becomes enslaved to him. <b>And Rabbi Akiva says: “If he is not redeemed”</b> in any other manner but <b>only “by any of these,” “then he shall go out in the Jubilee Year,”</b> i.e., if he is redeemed by relatives, he is emancipated only at the close of Yom Kippur of the Jubilee Year. By contrast, if he is redeemed by others he is emancipated immediately. <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili</b> respond to this claim? He would ask: <b>Is it written: Only by any of these?</b>
<b>Rather,</b> as this suggested interpretation of the verse by Rabbi Akiva is clearly problematic, the Gemara retracts the previous explanation of the dispute and instead says that <b>they disagree with regard to</b> the precise meaning of <b>this verse:</b> “Either his uncle or his uncle’s son may redeem him, or any that is near of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he becomes rich, and he is redeemed” (Leviticus 25:49). <b>“Either his uncle or his uncle’s son may redeem him”; this is the redemption</b> performed <b>by relatives. “Or if he becomes rich”</b>; <b>this is redemption</b> by <b>himself. “And he is redeemed”; this is redemption by other</b> people.
<b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili maintains: A verse is interpreted homiletically</b> based on its juxtaposition to the verse immediately <b>preceding it.</b> Therefore, one should <b>cast,</b> i.e., compare, the case of <b>redemption</b> performed <b>by relatives to</b> the case of <b>redemption</b> performed <b>by himself: Just as redemption</b> performed <b>by himself</b> leads <b>to</b> complete <b>freedom, so too, redemption</b> performed <b>by relatives</b> leads <b>to freedom. And Rabbi Akiva maintains</b> that <b>a verse is interpreted homiletically</b> based on its juxtaposition to the verse immediately <b>after it.</b> Therefore one should <b>cast</b> the case of <b>redemption</b> performed <b>by others to</b> the case of <b>redemption</b> performed <b>by himself: Just as redemption</b> performed <b>by himself is to freedom, so too, redemption</b> performed <b>by others is to freedom,</b> whereas if he is redeemed by his relatives, he becomes enslaved to them.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that this is their dispute, <b>why do I</b> need the phrase <b>“by any of these,”</b> according to both Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and Rabbi Akiva? The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it were <b>not</b> for the phrase <b>“by any of these,” I would say</b> that <b>a verse is interpreted homiletically</b> based on its juxtaposition to the verse immediately <b>preceding it as well as</b> to the verse immediately <b>after it, and</b> therefore in <b>every</b> manner in which he is redeemed it is <b>to freedom.</b> The phrase “by any of these” limits this freedom either to relatives or other people, according to the respective opinions of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and Rabbi Akiva.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that the different opinions are based on the phrase “by any of these,” then <b>the difficulty</b> with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, that the verse does not say: If he is not redeemed in any other manner but only by any of these, <b>has returned to its place,</b> i.e., it is still valid, as this phrase indicates that Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s interpretation of the verse is correct. <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and Rabbi Akiva <b>disagree with regard to reason.</b> Their dispute is a matter of logic and does not concern textual interpretation.
The Gemara elaborates. <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili maintains: It stands to reason</b> that <b>redemption</b> performed <b>by others</b> is <b>to slavery, as, if you say</b> it is <b>to freedom, they will refrain and will not redeem him.</b> If the slave is required to serve them, and they incur no financial loss, they will redeem him. <b>And Rabbi Akiva maintains: It stands to reason</b> that <b>redemption</b> performed <b>by relatives</b> is <b>to slavery, as, if you say</b> it is <b>to freedom, each and every day he will go and sell himself</b> over and again, relying on his relatives to free him.
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This is the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and Rabbi Akiva,</b> who hold that a slave is not invariably freed whenever he is redeemed from his gentile master. <b>But the Rabbis say</b> that in <b>every</b> case, when he is emancipated it is <b>to freedom.</b>
The Gemara inquires: <b>Who</b> are these <b>Rabbis?</b> It is <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who derives another exposition from this</b> term <b>“by any of these,”</b> as stated above. <b>And</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi maintains that <b>a verse is interpreted homiletically</b> based on its juxtaposition to the verse immediately <b>preceding it as well as</b> to the verse immediately <b>after it.</b> Consequently, the Hebrew slave of a gentile is emancipated regardless of whether he is redeemed by relatives or other people.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>what does he do with</b> the verse: “And if he is not redeemed by any of these means, <b>then he shall go out in the Jubilee Year”</b> (Leviticus 25:54)? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires</b> this verse <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Then he shall go out in the Jubilee Year.”</b> If the slave is not redeemed prior to this point in time he leaves his gentile master only in the Jubilee Year.

Daf 16a

This indicates that the verse is stated <b>with regard to a gentile who is under your authority,</b> i.e., one who is subject to Jewish rule. <b>Or</b> perhaps you will say that the verse is stated <b>only with regard to a gentile who is not under your authority.</b> This is not possible, as <b>you say: But what can be done to him</b> to compel him to obey the Torah’s commands? Consequently, <b>the verse must be speaking of nothing other</b> than <b>a gentile who is under your authority.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: A Hebrew slave can be acquired by his master through money <b>or through a document.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that he can be acquired through a document? <b>Ulla said: The verse states</b> with regard to a Hebrew maidservant: <b>“If he takes himself another wife”</b> (Exodus 21:10). <b>The verse</b> thereby <b>juxtaposes</b> a Hebrew maidservant <b>to another</b> woman who is betrothed: <b>Just as another</b> woman <b>can be acquired</b> by her husband <b>through a document</b> (see 2a), <b>so too, a Hebrew maidservant can be acquired through a document.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that the <b>master writes the document</b> of a <b>Hebrew maidservant,</b> just as a betrothal document is written by the husband. <b>But according the one who says</b> that the <b>father writes it,</b> in the manner of a document of sale, <b>what can be said?</b> According to that opinion, the document of a Hebrew maidservant is not similar to a betrothal document. <b>As it was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disagreed about this matter: With regard to <b>the document</b> of <b>a Hebrew maidservant, who writes it? Rav Huna says:</b> The <b>master writes it. Rav Ḥisda says:</b> The <b>father writes it. This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, but according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda, what can be said?</b>
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived from a different source. <b>The verse states</b> with regard to a Hebrew maidservant: <b>“She shall not go out as the men slaves do”</b> (Exodus 21:7). One can infer: <b>But she can be acquired in</b> the manner of <b>the acquisition of</b> Canaanite <b>male slaves. And what is</b> this mode of acquisition? It is <b>a document.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that the inference should be a different one: <b>But she can be acquired in</b> the manner of <b>the acquisition of</b> Canaanite <b>male slaves, and what is</b> this mode of acquisition? It is <b>possession.</b> The Gemara answers that one cannot interpret that verse in this manner, as <b>the verse states</b> with regard to Canaanite slaves: <b>“And you shall bequeath them to your children after you”</b> (Leviticus 25:46), which indicates that you can acquire only <b>them,</b> i.e., Canaanite slaves, <b>through possession,</b> like an inherited tract of land, <b>but other</b> slaves <b>cannot</b> be acquired <b>through possession.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, one can equally <b>say</b> that <b>they,</b> Canaanite slaves, can be acquired <b>through a document, but others cannot</b> be acquired <b>through a document.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Isn’t it written: “She shall not go out as the men slaves do”</b> (Exodus 21:7), and this is explained to mean that she, like other slaves, can be acquired through a document. The Gemara asks: Since these two verses can be explained in either manner, <b>what did you see</b> that led you to compare a Hebrew maidservant to a Canaanite slave with regard to a document, and what led you to differentiate her from a Canaanite slave with regard to acquisition through possession? Perhaps the opposite should be the case, i.e., she is similar to a Canaanite slave with regard to possession and differs from him concerning acquisition through a document?
The Gemara answers: <b>It stands to reason</b> that <b>a document should be included</b> in the acquisition of a slave, <b>as</b> a document is powerful in that it can <b>release a Jewish woman,</b> in the form of a bill of divorce. The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>On the contrary, possession should be included, as it can effect acquisition</b> in the case <b>of the property of a convert</b> who died without leaving heirs, whereas no other mode can be used to acquire such property. The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, <b>with regard to marriage, in any event, one does not find</b> acquisition by means of possession. <b>If you wish, say</b> another answer: It is <b>to that end,</b> i.e., to determine in which way to compare a Hebrew maidservant to a Canaanite slave, that the verse <b>“if</b> he takes <b>another,” is effective,</b> as it indicates that the acquisition of a Hebrew maidservant includes a mode of acquisition used in betrothal, i.e., a document.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rav Huna, what does he learn from this</b> verse: <b>“She shall not go out as the men slaves do”</b> (Exodus 21:7)? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires that</b> verse to teach <b>that she is not released on</b> account of an injury <b>to</b> the <b>extremities like</b> a Canaanite <b>slave.</b> If a master injures one of her limbs she is not emancipated, as explained in greater detail below. The Gemara asks: <b>And Rav Ḥisda,</b> from where does he derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> that it is teaching only one <i>halakha</i>, <b>let the verse write: She shall not go out as the men slaves. What</b> is the reason for the additional term <b>“as the men slaves do”? Conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from it:</b> She is not freed due to injured limbs, and like a slave, she too can be acquired by means of a document.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> a Hebrew slave <b>can acquire himself after</b> six <b>years</b> of work. The Gemara cites the source for this <i>halakha</i>: <b>As it is written: “Six years he shall labor; and in the seventh</b> he shall go out free for nothing” (Exodus 21:2).
§ The mishna further states that a Hebrew slave is emancipated <b>in the Jubilee</b> Year. The Gemara explains that this is <b>as it is written: “He shall labor with you until the Jubilee Year”</b> (Leviticus 25:40).
§ The mishna teaches that a Hebrew slave can be freed <b>through the deduction of money. Ḥizkiyya says</b> that the reason is <b>that the verse states: “Then he shall let her be redeemed”</b> (Exodus 21:8), which <b>teaches that</b> if she acquires money and wishes to be emancipated before her time is complete, she <b>deducts</b> the value of the years that she has not yet worked from the cost of <b>her redemption, and is emancipated.</b> The same <i>halakha</i> applies to a slave. A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught: And</b> a slave <b>can acquire himself with money, with</b> an item <b>worth money, and with a document.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>Granted,</b> he can be acquired through <b>money, as it is written: “Out of the money that he was bought for”</b> (Leviticus 25:51). Likewise, it is <b>also</b> clear that he can be acquired with an item <b>worth money,</b> as <b>the Merciful One states: “He shall give back the price of his redemption”</b> (Leviticus 25:51), which serves <b>to include</b> an item of <b>monetary value,</b> which is considered <b>like money.</b> In other words, any item of value can be used to redeem a slave. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>this document</b> mentioned here, <b>what are the circumstances? If we say that</b> the slave <b>wrote</b> a promissory <b>note for his own money, that is</b> the same as <b>money.</b> What is the difference between the two cases?
<b>Rather,</b> this is referring to a document of <b>manumission</b> written by the master when the slave is emancipated. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a document</b> for this purpose? <b>Let him say in the presence of two</b> witnesses: <b>Go</b> free. <b>Alternatively,</b> let him say <b>before a court: Go</b> free. <b>Rava says: That is to say</b> that <b>the body of a Hebrew slave is owned</b> by his master, and this is not merely a monetary debt. <b>And</b> in the case of <b>a master who relinquishes his deduction,</b> i.e., the money that the slave must return for the years he has not yet served, <b>his deduction is not relinquished.</b> Although one can relinquish a monetary debt verbally, this is insufficient to release a slave whose body is owned by his master. A document is required to effect his freedom.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>a Hebrew maidservant has</b> one mode of emancipation <b>more than</b> a Hebrew slave, as she acquires herself through signs indicating puberty. <b>Reish Lakish says: A Hebrew maidservant acquires herself from the master’s authority through the death of</b> her <b>father.</b> This is derived <b>through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If signs</b> indicating puberty, <b>which do not release her from</b> her <b>father’s authority,</b> as, although she develops signs of puberty she remains under her father’s authority with regard to certain matters, nevertheless <b>release her from the master’s authority, is it not logical that death, which releases her</b> entirely <b>from</b> her <b>father’s authority,</b> should <b>release her from</b> her <b>master’s authority?</b>
<b>Rav Hoshaya raises an objection</b> from the mishna: <b>A Hebrew maidservant has</b> one mode of emancipation <b>more than</b> a Hebrew slave, <b>as she acquires herself through signs</b> indicating puberty. <b>And if it is so</b> that she also acquires herself through her father’s death, as claimed by Reish Lakish, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach also</b> that she is released through <b>the death of the father.</b> The Gemara answers: The absence of an explicit statement is not proof, as the mishna <b>taught</b> one difference between a male slave and a maidservant <b>and omitted</b> others.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> else <b>did he omit that he omitted this?</b> The <i>tanna</i> would certainly not leave out only one <i>halakha</i>. The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> <b>omitted the death of the master.</b> In the event of the master’s death, the Hebrew maidservant is emancipated and is not inherited by the master’s heirs. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>If</b> it is <b>due to the death of the master, that is not an omission.</b> The reason is <b>that since there is also</b> a similar <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a man,</b> i.e., a pierced slave, the mishna <b>does not teach</b> this case.
<b>But</b> if so, the question remains: <b>Rather, let it teach</b> that she is emancipated through the death of her father. The Gemara answers: The <b><i>tanna</i></b> in the mishna <b>teaches a matter that has a set time,</b> and <b>he does not teach a matter that does not have a set time,</b> e.g., the death of her father.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> there is the case of <b>signs</b> indicating puberty, <b>which do not have a set time,</b> as young women exhibit these signs of puberty at different ages, <b>and</b> yet <b>it teaches</b> this mode of emancipation anyway. <b>Rav Safra says:</b> Admittedly, these signs <b>have no maximum set time,</b> as once she reaches the age of twelve she is emancipated whenever she develops these signs, <b>but they do have a set time</b>

Daf 16b

with regard to the <b>minimum</b> age at which these signs are taken into consideration. In other words, there is a lower limit, as any signs of puberty before a certain age are ignored.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Everyone agrees with regard to <b>a nine-year-old</b> boy <b>who developed two</b> pubic <b>hairs</b> that this is not considered a sign of adulthood, as they are treated as hairs that grow on <b>a mole. From</b> the age of <b>nine years and one day until</b> the age of <b>twelve years and one day,</b> even if <b>they are still on him</b> and have not fallen out, this is still considered <b>a mole. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> It is <b>a sign</b> indicating puberty. If he is <b>thirteen years and one day old</b> and grows two hairs, <b>everyone agrees</b> that this is <b>a sign</b> indicating puberty.
<b>Rav Sheshet raises an objection:</b> It is taught in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> There are <b>four</b> different ways of emancipating slaves, and when they are emancipated <b>one grants them a severance gift.</b> Of these, <b>three</b> apply <b>to a man,</b> i.e., a Hebrew slave, <b>and three</b> apply <b>to a woman,</b> a Hebrew maidservant. <b>And you cannot say</b> that there are <b>four</b> ways <b>for</b> either <b>one</b> of them, <b>because there is no</b> emancipation through <b>signs</b> indicating puberty <b>for a man, and there is no</b> emancipation through <b>piercing</b> the ear <b>for a woman.</b> Consequently, there are only three modes of emancipation for each.
The Gemara clarifies the difficulty: <b>And if it is so</b> that a Hebrew maidservant acquires herself through her father’s death, as claimed by Reish Lakish, <b>let him teach also</b> that a Hebrew maidservant is emancipated at <b>the death of the father. And if you would say, here too he taught</b> some differences between a Hebrew slave and a Hebrew maidservant <b>and omitted</b> others, this cannot be the case, as <b>he teaches:</b> There are <b>four</b> ways of emancipating slaves. The mention of a number indicates that there is a set number of ways. <b>And if you would say</b> that the <b><i>tanna</i> teaches a matter that has a set time and does not teach a matter that does not have a set time, as</b> there is the <i>halakha</i> of <b>signs</b> indicating puberty, <b>which do not have a set time, and</b> nevertheless <b>he teaches</b> it.
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>here, too,</b> this is <b>in accordance</b> with the opinion of <b>Rav Safra,</b> that signs have a minimum set time, <b>there is still the death of the master,</b> which <b>does not have a set time, and</b> yet he <b>taught</b> it. The Gemara answers: <b>The death of the master is not taught either,</b> i.e., this mode of emancipation is not counted among the four modes mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if you do not count the death of the master, <b>what are these four</b> methods? The Gemara answers: A Hebrew slave or maidservant is emancipated after serving six <b>years and</b> in <b>the Jubilee</b> Year, even if it occurs within those six years. <b>And the Jubilee</b> Year also emancipates a slave, even <b>after</b> the act of <b>piercing</b> a Hebrew slave’s ear with an awl extended his term of slavery, <b>and a Hebrew maidservant</b> is emancipated <b>with signs</b> indicating puberty.
The Gemara adds: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> that this is the correct interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>as it teaches in the last clause: You cannot say</b> that there are <b>four</b> modes <b>for</b> either <b>one of them, because there is no</b> emancipation through <b>signs</b> indicating puberty <b>for a man, and there is no</b> emancipation through <b>piercing for a woman. And if it is so</b> that the death of the master is included, in the case <b>of a woman, at least, you find four</b> ways that she can be freed: Six years of service, the Jubilee Year, signs of puberty, and the death of the master. The Gemara comments: <b>Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that it is so.
<b>Rav Amram</b> also <b>raises an objection</b> against the opinion of Reish Lakish from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And these</b> are the slaves <b>to whom one grants a severance gift: One who leaves through</b> six <b>years</b> of service, <b>and</b> one who leaves <b>in the Jubilee</b> Year, <b>and</b> one who leaves <b>through the death of the master, and a Hebrew maidservant</b> who is released <b>by signs</b> indicating puberty. <b>And if it is so</b> that she is emancipated through her father’s death as well, as claimed by Reish Lakish, <b>let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>also teach</b> that she is released through <b>the death of the father. And if you would say, here too, he taught</b> some differences between a Hebrew slave and maidservant <b>and omitted</b> others, <b>he teaches: These,</b> which indicates that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to a slave freed in these ways and no others.
<b>And if you would say</b> that the <b><i>tanna</i> teaches a matter that has a set time and does not teach a matter that does not have a set time, but</b> isn’t there the case of <b>signs</b> indicating puberty, <b>which do not have a set time, and</b> nevertheless <b>he teaches</b> it. <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>here too,</b> this is <b>in accordance</b> with the opinion of <b>Rav Safra</b> that signs have a minimum set time, <b>there is the death of the master,</b> which <b>does not have a set time, and</b> yet <b>he taught</b> it. Therefore, this is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish.</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>The refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish is</b> indeed <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the ruling of <b>Reish Lakish</b> is based on <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, and nothing has been said to contradict his reasoning. The Gemara answers: <b>The <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>is refutable, because</b> it <b>can be refuted</b> in the following manner: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about signs</b> indicating puberty is that they indicate <b>that her body has changed,</b> and perhaps she is emancipated because she is now considered a different person. <b>Will you say</b> the same <b>with regard to the death of the father, as</b> her <b>body has not changed?</b>
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>The severance gift</b> bestowed upon <b>a Hebrew slave</b> when he is emancipated is given <b>to</b> the slave <b>himself, and the severance gift</b> bestowed upon <b>a Hebrew maidservant</b> is given <b>to</b> the maidservant <b>herself. And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The <b>severance gift of a Hebrew maidservant and</b> any <b>lost items</b> she finds belong <b>to her father, and her master has only</b> the <b>reimbursement for her lost time.</b> He is paid the money he would have earned if she had been working instead of carrying home the items she found.
The Gemara suggests: <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that the difference between the two <i>baraitot</i> is that <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>, which says that the severance gift is given to her father, is referring to <b>when she leaves through signs</b> indicating puberty, as she is a young woman and still under the authority of her father with regard to certain matters, <b>and this</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that the severance gift is given to her, is referring to a case <b>when she leaves through the death of the father.</b> Since she does not have a father she keeps the severance gift herself. This explanation is in accordance with the opinion of Reish Lakish, that she is emancipated through the death of her father, and it contradicts the conclusion that his ruling should be rejected.
The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>No,</b> both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are referring to a maidservant <b>who left through signs</b> indicating puberty, <b>and it</b> is <b>not difficult: This</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where there is a father</b> who can take the gift, and <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where there is no father,</b> i.e., he died before she developed the signs of puberty. In that case she receives the severance gift herself.
The Gemara comments: <b>Granted,</b> one can understand the <i>baraita</i> that taught that the <b>severance gift of a Hebrew maidservant</b> is <b>for herself,</b> as this serves <b>to exclude</b> the maidservant’s <b>brothers.</b> These brothers do not receive the gifts after her father’s death, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And you shall bequeath them to your children after you”</b> (Leviticus 25:46). This verse indicates that <b>they,</b> Canaanite slaves, are bequeathed <b>to your sons, but your daughters</b> are <b>not</b> bequeathed <b>to your sons. From here</b> it is derived <b>that a person may not bequeath</b> his <b>rights to</b> profits generated by <b>his daughter to his son.</b>
<b>But it is obvious</b> that <b>the severance gift of a Hebrew slave is for himself. Rather, to whom</b> could it be given? <b>Rav Yosef said: I see here</b> a small letter <b><i>yod</i></b> that has been made into a large <b>city.</b> In other words, although it was not necessary for the <i>tanna</i> to teach this <i>halakha</i>, he stated it out of habit despite the fact that this ruling does not teach anything novel.
<b>Abaye said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said like this:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of the Sage <b>Tutai. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Tutai says:</b> The verse: “You shall grant severance <b>to him”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:14), indicates that it is given to a Hebrew slave <b>but not to his creditor.</b> Even if the slave owes money, this gift is not given to the creditor.
The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. And these</b> are the Hebrew slaves <b>to whom one grants a severance gift: One who leaves through</b> completing six <b>years</b> of service, <b>and</b> one who leaves <b>in the Jubilee</b> Year, <b>and</b> one who leaves <b>through the death of the master, and a Hebrew maidservant</b> who is released <b>by signs</b> indicating the onset of puberty. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>one who flees</b> from his master <b>or one who is released by deducting money, one does not grant a severance gift to him. Rabbi Meir says:</b> With regard to <b>one who flees, one does not grant a severance gift to him, but</b> in the case of <b>one who is released by deducting money, one does grant a severance gift to him.</b>
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> There are <b>four</b> different ways of emancipating a Hebrew slave, and when Hebrew slaves are emancipated <b>one grants them a severance gift.</b> Of these methods, <b>three</b> apply <b>to a man and three</b> apply <b>to a woman. And you cannot say four</b> modes apply <b>for</b> either <b>one</b> of them, <b>because there is no</b> emancipation through <b>signs</b> indicating puberty <b>for a man, and there is no piercing for a woman.</b> This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara explains that this is <b>as the Sages taught:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one grants a severance gift only to</b> a Hebrew slave <b>who is released after six</b> years. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to include</b> that one grants a severance gift to one who <b>left in the Jubilee</b> Year, <b>and</b> one freed <b>through the death of the master, and a Hebrew maidservant</b> who leaves <b>through signs</b> indicating puberty? <b>The verse states:</b> “You shall not <b>send him,”</b> and: <b>“And when you send him”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:13). These phrases serve to expand the <i>halakha</i> of severance to include any Hebrew slave who is emancipated.
I <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> should <b>include</b> a Hebrew slave <b>who flees and</b> one <b>who is released through the deduction of money.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And when you send him free from you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:13), which is referring to <b>one who was sent from you</b> with your knowledge and consent. This <b>excludes</b> a Hebrew slave <b>who flees</b> from his master <b>and</b> one who <b>is released through the deduction of money, who are not sent away from you</b> with your permission. <b>Rabbi Meir says: One does not grant a severance gift to</b> a Hebrew slave <b>who flees, as he is not sent away from you,</b> because he left on his own. <b>But</b> with regard to a Hebrew slave who <b>is released through the deduction of money, who is sent from you,</b> he is granted a severance gift, as this deduction payment requires the agreement of the master.
The Gemara asks: Isn’t a Hebrew slave <b>who flees required to complete</b> the remaining years of his contract, at which point he should be entitled to receive a severance gift? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived with regard to a Hebrew slave <b>who flees</b> his master <b>that he is obligated to complete</b> his term? <b>The verse states: “Six years he shall labor”</b> (Exodus 21:2), and no less. Therefore, if a Hebrew slave runs away in the middle of this period, he is required to complete his six years of service.

Daf 17a

One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> a slave who <b>became sick</b> and is unable to work must work additional time to compensate for the time missed. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And in the seventh he shall go out”</b> (Exodus 21:2), which indicates that he leaves his master in any case, even if he has not worked the full six years.
<b>Rav Sheshet said: With what are we dealing here?</b> This concerns a case <b>where he fled and the Jubilee</b> Year <b>arrived</b> immediately afterward, and therefore he did not complete the six years of servitude. The novelty of this <i>halakha</i> is as follows. <b>Lest you say: Since the Jubilee</b> Year <b>released him, he is considered sent away by you,</b> the master, <b>and</b> therefore <b>we should not penalize him but grant him the severance gift,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that once he flees he forfeits his right to the severance gift.
<b>The Master said</b> above: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> a slave who <b>became sick</b> and was unable to work must work additional time to compensate for the time missed. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And in the seventh he shall go out”</b> (Exodus 21:2). The Gemara asks: Is he excused from working additional time <b>even</b> if <b>he was sick for all six</b> years? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>he was sick</b> for <b>three</b> years <b>and served</b> for <b>three</b> years, <b>he is not obligated to complete</b> the six years of actual labor, but if <b>he was sick</b> for <b>all six</b> years <b>he is obligated to complete</b> the six years of actual labor. <b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> This is referring to a case where he is unable to perform strenuous labor but can execute minor tasks, such <b>as performing needlework</b> or sewing clothes. Since he can perform work of some kind, this slave is not required to work additional time to compensate for the time missed, even if he was ill for all six years.
The Gemara comments: <b>This matter itself is difficult,</b> as the <i>baraita</i> is apparently self-contradictory. On the one hand, <b>you said</b> that if <b>he was sick for three</b> years <b>and he served for</b> the other <b>three</b> years <b>he is not obligated to complete</b> the six years of actual labor. <b>This</b> indicates that if he was ill for <b>four</b> years <b>he is obligated to complete</b> the six years of labor. On the other hand, <b>say the last clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: If <b>he was sick</b> for <b>all six</b> years <b>he is obligated to complete</b> the six years of actual labor. <b>That</b> indicates that if he was ill for <b>four</b> years <b>he is not obligated to complete</b> the six years of actual labor. The Gemara answers that <b>this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If <b>he was sick</b> for <b>four</b> years <b>he becomes as one who was sick for all six</b> years, <b>and</b> therefore <b>he is required to complete</b> the six years of actual labor.
§ <b>The Sages taught: How much does one grant</b> a freed slave as <b>a severance gift?</b> It is <b>five <i>sela</i></b> in value <b>of each and every type</b> mentioned in this verse: “And you shall grant severance to him out of your flock, and out of your threshing floor, and out of your winepress” (Deuteronomy 15:14), <b>which is</b> a total of <b>fifteen <i>sela</i>.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> He is given <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i> in total, <b>like the thirty</b> shekels <b>of</b> the fine that is paid for <b>a slave</b> (see Exodus 21:32). <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The master gives him <b>fifty</b> shekels, <b>like</b> the sum <b>of valuations,</b> in which fifty shekels is the largest designated amount for a man (see Leviticus 27:3).
<b>The Master said</b> above: The master gives <b>five <i>sela</i> of each and every type, which is fifteen <i>sela</i>;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does <b>Rabbi Meir come to teach us</b> to <b>count?</b> His novelty certainly cannot be that three fives equal fifteen. The Gemara answers that Rabbi Meir <b>teaches us this:</b> The master may <b>not</b> give <b>less than this</b> total <b>number, but if he gives him less of one type and more of one</b> other <b>type, we have no</b> problem <b>with it,</b> and he has fulfilled the mitzva.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Meir?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>He derives</b> a verbal analogy from <b>“empty”</b> stated with regard to the severance gift: “You shall not send him away empty” (Deuteronomy 15:13), and <b>“empty”</b> stated <b>with regard to a firstborn:</b> “All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem; and none shall appear before Me empty” (Exodus 34:20). <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of the firstborn, one must give <b>five <i>sela</i>, so too here,</b> in the case of severance gifts, one must give <b>five <i>sela</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that he is obligated to give only <b>five <i>sela</i></b> in total <b>from all of</b> the three types listed in the verse. The Gemara answers: <b>If “empty” were written at the end</b> of the verse, i.e., Deuteronomy 15:14, the <i>halakha</i> would be <b>as you said.</b> But <b>now that “empty” is written before</b> the verse, i.e., at the end of Deuteronomy 15:13, <b>apply</b> the phrase “Do not send him away <b>empty” to “flock,”</b> and apply <b>“empty” to “threshing floor,”</b> and likewise apply <b>“empty” to “winepress.”</b> Consequently, there must be five <i>sela</i> for each type.
The Gemara asks: <b>And let us derive</b> a verbal analogy between <b>“empty”</b> and <b>“empty” from</b> the case of <b>the burnt-offering of appearance</b> in the Temple brought on the pilgrimage Festivals, with regard to which it is said: “And they shall not appear before the Lord empty” (Deuteronomy 16:16). The burnt-offering of appearance has no fixed value. The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “Of that with which the Lord your God has blessed you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:14), which indicates that one must give a respectable amount as a severance gift.
The <i>baraita</i> states that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that a freed slave is given <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i> in total, <b>like the thirty</b> shekels of the fine that is paid <b>for a slave.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives</b> a verbal analogy between <b>giving,</b> as stated with regard to the severance gift, <b>from</b> the expression of <b>giving</b> stated in connection to a Canaanite <b>slave</b> gored by an ox: “He shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver” (Exodus 21:32). <b>Just as there,</b> he must pay <b>thirty</b> shekels for the slave, <b>so too here,</b> in the case of a severance gift, he must pay <b>thirty.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But let him derive</b> a similar verbal analogy between <b>“giving”</b> stated with regard to the severance gift and <b>“giving” from valuations</b> (see Leviticus 27:23): <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of valuations, it is <b>fifty</b> shekels for an adult male, <b>so too here,</b> it should be <b>fifty.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>One</b> answer is, as people say, <b>that if you grasped too much, you did not grasp anything; if you grasped a bit, you grasped</b> something. In other words, if there are two possible sources from which to derive the sum of the severance gift, then without conclusive proof one may not presume that the Torah intended to teach the larger amount. Consequently, the master should be required to give only thirty shekels, not fifty. <b>And furthermore, one should derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of a slave,</b> i.e., the severance gift, <b>from</b> another case involving <b>a slave,</b> i.e., the thirty shekels paid when a Canaanite slave is gored by an ox, rather than derive the <i>halakha</i> of the severance gift from valuations, which apply to all people.
The <i>baraita</i> further teaches that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The master gives him <b>fifty</b> shekels, <b>like the fifty</b> shekels <b>of valuations</b> for an adult male. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon? He derived</b> a verbal analogy between <b>“giving”</b> and <b>“giving” from valuations</b> (Leviticus 27:23): <b>Just as there,</b> he pays <b>fifty, so too here,</b> he pays <b>fifty.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that as this verbal analogy is referring to valuations in general, he should pay <b>the smallest of the valuations,</b> which is merely three <i>sela</i>. The Gemara answers that <b>it is written: “Of that with which the Lord your God has blessed you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:14), which indicates that one must give a respectable amount as a severance gift.
The Gemara asks: <b>But let</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>derive,</b> like Rabbi Yehuda, the verbal analogy between <b>“giving”</b> and <b>“giving” from</b> the verses discussing the goring of a Canaanite <b>slave,</b> teaching that <b>just as there</b> he pays <b>thirty, so too here,</b> he pays <b>thirty?</b> The Gemara adds that there are two reasons to prefer this derivation, as stated above: <b>One</b> reason is <b>that if you grasped too much, you did not grasp anything; if you grasped a bit, you grasped</b> something. <b>And furthermore, one should derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of a slave from</b> another case involving <b>a slave.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Shimon derives</b> a verbal analogy between <b>poverty</b> and <b>poverty.</b> With regard to valuations the Torah states: “But if he is too poor” (Leviticus 27:8), and concerning a Hebrew slave the verse says: “And if your brother grows poor” (Leviticus 25:39).
Having ascertained the source for each of the opinions in the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara analyzes their opinions. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> with regard <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, this is as it is written “flock,” “threshing floor,” and “winepress,”</b> as he derives from these three terms that the severance gift must be worth fifteen <i>sela</i>. <b>But according to</b> the opinions of <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon, why do I</b> need <b>these</b> terms <b>“flock,” “threshing floor,” and “winepress,”</b> in light of the fact that one may give his slave any product?
The Gemara answers: <b>These</b> terms <b>are necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one grants severance gifts only</b> from <b>the flock, the threshing floor, and the winepress; from where</b> is it derived <b>to include every matter? The verse states: “Of that with which the Lord your God has blessed you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:14). <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “flock,” “threshing floor,” and “winepress”?</b> This serves <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as a flock, a threshing floor, and a winepress are unique in that they are included in</b> the category of <b>blessing,</b> i.e., they grow and multiply, <b>so too all</b> items <b>that are included in</b> the category of <b>blessing</b> may be given as a severance gift. This <b>excludes money,</b> which does not increase on its own. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> This <b>excludes mules,</b> which cannot reproduce.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Shimon,</b> why does he exclude money but not mules? The Gemara answers: With regard to <b>mules, their bodies</b> grow and <b>enhance.</b> Although they do not reproduce, they still grow. <b>And Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov,</b> why doesn’t he exclude money? He maintains that <b>one can conduct business with money</b> and thereby profit from it. In this manner money can increase.
The Gemara notes: <b>And it is necessary</b> for the Torah to mention a flock, a threshing floor, and a winepress, <b>as, if the Merciful One had written</b> only <b>“flock,” I would say</b> that <b>animals, yes,</b> the master may give them to his slave upon his release, but that which <b>grows from the ground, no,</b> he may not give them. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes “threshing floor.” And if</b> the Torah <b>had written</b> only <b>“threshing floor,” I would say</b> that that which <b>grows from the ground, yes,</b> he may give them, but <b>animals, no,</b> he may not give them. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes “flock.”</b> The Gemara asks: Since threshing floor is stated, <b>why do I</b> need the mention of <b>a winepress?</b>

Daf 17b

The Gemara answers: According <b>to</b> one <b>Master,</b> Rabbi Shimon, this term serves <b>to exclude money.</b> According <b>to</b> the other <b>Master,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, it serves <b>to exclude mules.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: “And you shall grant severance to him out of your flock, and out of your threshing floor, and out of your winepress, <b>of that with which the Lord your God has blessed you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:14). One <b>might</b> have thought that if the <b>house is blessed due to him,</b> then the master <b>grants him a severance gift,</b> and if the <b>house is not blessed due to him,</b> he <b>does not grant him a severance gift.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall grant severance [<i>ha’anek ta’anik</i>],”</b> with the doubled form of the verb used for emphasis, to indicate that you must grant him a severance gift <b>in any case. If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Of that with which</b> the Lord your God <b>has blessed you”?</b> This teaches that <b>all</b> that one <b>gives him</b> as a severance gift should be <b>in accordance with the blessing</b> one possesses.
<b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says:</b> The meaning of the <b>statements</b> of the Torah is <b>as they are written,</b> i.e., as indicated by a straightforward reading of the verse. Therefore, if <b>the house was blessed due to him,</b> the master <b>grants him a severance gift,</b> and if <b>the house was not blessed due to him,</b> he <b>does not grant him a severance gift</b> at all. <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “You shall grant severance [<i>ha’anek ta’anik</i>],”</b> with the doubled form of the verb? <b>The Torah spoke in the language of people,</b> i.e., the emphasis of the doubled verb is merely stylistic, but does not serve to teach a novel <i>halakha</i>.
§ <b>The Sages taught: A Hebrew slave serves the son</b> of his deceased master <b>but does not serve the daughter. A Hebrew maidservant serves neither the son nor the daughter,</b> but only the master. <b>A pierced</b> slave <b>and</b> a Hebrew slave <b>sold to a gentile serve neither the son nor the daughter. The Master said</b> above: <b>A Hebrew slave serves the son but does not serve the daughter.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived?
<b>As the Sages taught,</b> with regard to a verse that deals with a Hebrew slave: <b>“And he shall serve you six years”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:12). This indicates that he serves <b>you and not an heir,</b> i.e., if the master dies his slave does not serve one who inherits his estate. Do <b>you say: You and not an heir, or</b> perhaps <b>is it even: You and not a son?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>When it says: “Six years he shall labor”</b> (Exodus 21:2), which does not indicate any exclusion, the inclusion of <b>a son is</b> thereby <b>stated. How</b> then <b>do I uphold</b> the other verse: <b>“And he shall serve you six years”?</b> The expression “serve you” emphasizes that he serves only <b>you but</b> he does <b>not</b> serve <b>an heir</b> other than a son.
The Gemara asks: <b>What did you see</b> that led you <b>to include the son</b> who inherits a Hebrew slave <b>and to exclude the brother</b> from inheriting his brother’s slave? The Gemara answers: <b>I include the son, as he stands in place of his father to designate her.</b> Just as a father can designate a Hebrew maidservant as a wife for himself, so too can he betroth her on behalf of his son. <b>And</b> similarly, he replaces his father with regard <b>to an ancestral field</b> (see Leviticus 27:16–21). If one redeems a field consecrated by his father, it is considered as though the father himself had redeemed it, which means that the field returns to the family in the Jubilee Year. If someone else redeems the field, including a brother, it does not return to the family.
The Gemara asks: <b>On the contrary, I</b> should <b>include the brother, as he stands in his brother’s place with regard to levirate marriage.</b> The Gemara responds: This is insufficient proof, as <b>is there levirate marriage other</b> than <b>in a case when there is no son?</b> If <b>there is a son, there is no levirate marriage.</b> This indicates that a son replaces the deceased before a brother, even with regard to levirate marriage.
The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, the reason for</b> this <i>halakha</i> is specifically that <b>there is this refutation</b> that a levirate marriage applies only when there is no son. Does that not indicate that <b>without this</b> consideration I would say that <b>a brother is preferable</b> to a son? <b>But let me derive</b> that a son has a greater claim of standing in place of his father than a brother <b>from</b> the fact that <b>here,</b> with regard to the preference of a son, there are <b>two</b> cases: Designation of a Hebrew maidservant and an ancestral field, <b>and here,</b> in the case of a brother, there is only <b>one:</b> Levirate marriage.
The Gemara answers: With regard to <b>an ancestral field too, the <i>tanna</i> derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from this</b> same <b>refutation.</b> The <i>tanna</i> learns from the case of levirate marriage that only the son, not the brother, takes the place of his father for the redemption of the field, employing the same reasoning mentioned above: <b>Is there levirate marriage other</b> than <b>in a case when there is no son?</b> Therefore, without this consideration there is only one supporting example for each claim.
§ The <i>baraita</i> taught that <b>a Hebrew maidservant serves neither the brother nor the daughter.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Padda said: As the verse states</b> with regard to a pierced Hebrew slave: <b>“And also to your maidservant you shall do likewise”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:17). <b>The verse juxtaposes</b> a Hebrew maidservant <b>to a pierced</b> slave: <b>Just as a pierced</b> slave <b>serves neither the son nor the daughter, so too a Hebrew maidservant serves neither the son nor the daughter.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does <b>this</b> verse: <b>“And also to your maidservant you shall do likewise,” come</b> to teach <b>this</b> matter? The <i>tanna</i> <b>requires it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, that the verse: <b>“And also to your maidservant you shall do likewise,”</b> is a command <b>to grant</b> her <b>a severance gift.</b>
Do <b>you say</b> that this comparison obligates one <b>to grant a severance gift</b> to a Hebrew maidservant, <b>or is it</b> teaching <b>only</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of <b>piercing</b> a Hebrew slave’s ear with an awl, which is stated immediately beforehand, applies to a Hebrew maidservant as well? The Gemara explains: <b>When it says</b> with regard to piercing: <b>“But if the slave shall say”</b> (Exodus 21:5), which indicates that a Hebrew slave can issue this declaration <b>but a Hebrew maidservant cannot,</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>piercing is</b> thereby <b>stated</b> and accounted for.
<b>How do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“And also to your maidservant you shall do likewise”?</b> This obligates a master <b>to grant a severance gift</b> to a freed Hebrew maidservant. If so, one cannot derive from this verse that a Hebrew maidservant serves neither the son nor the daughter. The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> that it comes only to compare her to a pierced Hebrew slave, <b>let the verse write</b> merely: <b>To your maidservant likewise. What</b> is the meaning of the additional phrase: <b>“You shall do”? Draw two conclusions from</b> this: A Hebrew maidservant does not serve the son, and she is granted severance gifts.
§ The <i>baraita</i> further teaches that <b>a pierced</b> Hebrew slave <b>and one sold to a gentile serve neither the son nor the daughter.</b> The Gemara explains: The <i>halakha</i> of <b>a pierced</b> slave is <b>as it is written: “And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl, and he shall serve him forever”</b> (Exodus 21:6), which indicates that he serves this master, <b>but not the son or the daughter.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it derived that the same applies to a Hebrew slave <b>sold to a gentile? Ḥizkiyya says</b> that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the emancipating of a slave who was sold to a gentile: <b>“And he shall reckon with his purchaser”</b> (Leviticus 25:50), which teaches that this applies only to his purchaser <b>but not to the heirs of his purchaser.</b>
<b>Rava says: By Torah law a gentile inherits</b> the property of <b>his father, as it is stated</b> with regard to one sold to a gentile: <b>“And he shall reckon with his purchaser,” but not with his purchaser’s heirs.</b> One can derive from here <b>by inference</b> that ordinarily a gentile <b>has heirs.</b> By contrast, <b>by Torah law a convert does not</b> inherit the property of his father or any other <b>gentile,</b> as once he converts he is considered a new person with no ties to his previous family. <b>Rather,</b> a convert inherits the property of his father <b>by rabbinic law.</b>
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 6:10): With regard to <b>a convert and a gentile who inherited</b> property <b>from their gentile father, the convert can say to the gentile: You take</b> the objects of <b>idol worship and I</b> will take <b>money; you take wine</b> used for <b>a libation</b> to idolatry <b>and I</b> will take <b>produce.</b> Provided that these objects have not entered the domain of the convert, he may divide everything with his brother so that his brother takes as an inheritance the items that the convert is prohibited from using as a Jew. But <b>once they have come into the convert’s possession,</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> for him to exchange these objects with his brother, as he would thereby be benefiting from idolatry.
<b>And if it would enter your mind</b> that a convert inherits property from his father <b>by Torah law, it</b> should be prohibited <b>when</b> these objects <b>have not</b> yet <b>come into his possession as well,</b> as <b>when he takes</b> money or produce and gives the idols to the gentile, <b>he takes</b> an item that has been <b>exchanged for</b> objects of <b>idol worship.</b> Since he receives half the inheritance at the moment when his father dies, he has a share in these items as well.
<b>Rather,</b> a convert inherits property from his father <b>by rabbinic law,</b> as this is <b>a decree that the Sages instituted lest he return to his</b> previous <b>wayward path [<i>suro</i>].</b> The Sages were concerned that due to his concern over losing his inheritance, a convert might return to his gentile lifestyle. In any event, as he does not inherit his father’s property by Torah law, the idols are not considered his property. <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> He may do this <b>when they inherited. But when</b> the convert and the gentile <b>formed a partnership, it is prohibited</b> for him to divide the property so that the gentile takes the idols, as the convert benefits from them indirectly.
With regard to the same issue it is taught: <b>By Torah law and by rabbinic law a gentile does not</b> inherit property <b>from</b> his father who is <b>a convert, nor</b> does <b>a convert</b> inherit property <b>from</b> his father who is <b>a convert. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 10:9): If one <b>borrowed money from a convert whose sons converted with him,</b> and therefore when they converted there were no longer any legal ties between the sons and the father, <b>he does not return</b> it <b>to</b> the creditor’s <b>sons,</b> as they are not considered his heirs. <b>And if he</b> does <b>return</b> it, <b>the Sages are not pleased with him.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>the Sages are pleased with him?</b> The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> it is referring to a convert <b>whose conception and birth were not in sanctity</b> of the Jewish people, i.e., his father was a gentile when he was born and afterward the son converted. In this case there are no legal ties between the father and the son, and therefore one who owes money to the father is not required to pay the son.

Daf 18a

<b>And here</b> it is referring to a case <b>where he was not conceived in sanctity,</b> i.e., his mother conceived him before she converted, <b>and</b> only <b>his birth was in sanctity,</b> as she converted when pregnant. It is appropriate to return money to this individual.
<b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin</b> says that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: By Torah law a gentile inherits</b> from <b>his father, as it is written: “Because I have given mount Seir to Esau as an inheritance”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:5). The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> it <b>is different</b> with regard to <b>an apostate Jew?</b> In other words, it is possible that Esau was not considered a gentile but rather Jewish, like the Patriarchs. Consequently, he is categorized as an apostate Jew. <b>Rather,</b> the proof is <b>from here: “Because I have given Ar to the children of Lot as an inheritance”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:9), and the descendants of Lot were certainly gentiles.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin, what is the reason</b> that he <b>did not state</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rava,</b> who derives the inheritance of gentiles from the verse: “And he shall reckon with his purchaser” (Leviticus 25:50)? The Gemara answers: <b>Is it written</b> explicitly in the Torah: <b>And he shall reckon with his purchaser and not with the heirs of his purchaser?</b> This proof is based on an exposition, not on an explicit source.
The Gemara further asks: <b>And Rava, what is the reason</b> that he <b>did not state</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin?</b> The Gemara answers: Perhaps <b>due to the honor of Abraham</b> it <b>is different.</b> It is possible that for the sake of Abraham an inheritance was given to the members of his family. The same may not apply to gentiles in general.
§ <b>The Sages taught: There are</b> details <b>of</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a Hebrew</b> slave <b>that do not</b> apply <b>to</b> the case of <b>a Hebrew</b> maidservant and <b>there are</b> details <b>of</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a Hebrew</b> maidservant <b>that do not</b> apply <b>to a Hebrew</b> slave. The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: <b>There are</b> unique details <b>in</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of emancipating <b>a Hebrew</b> slave, <b>as he leaves through</b> serving a term of six <b>years, and</b> he leaves <b>through the Jubilee</b> Year, <b>and</b> he leaves <b>through the death of the master, which is not the case for a Hebrew</b> maidservant. <b>And there are</b> unique details <b>in</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of emancipating <b>a Hebrew</b> maidservant, <b>as a Hebrew</b> maidservant <b>leaves through signs</b> indicating puberty, <b>and</b> she is <b>not sold for a second time, and one can redeem her against his will,</b> as the Gemara will explain, <b>which is not the case for a Hebrew</b> slave.
The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> above: <b>There are</b> details <b>of</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of emancipating <b>a Hebrew</b> slave <b>that do not</b> apply <b>to</b> the case of <b>a Hebrew</b> maidservant. <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from the mishna: <b>A Hebrew maidservant has</b> one mode of emancipation <b>more than him, as she acquires herself through signs</b> indicating puberty. The expression: More than him, indicates that all of the modes through which a Hebrew slave can be freed apply to a Hebrew maidservant as well. <b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> This <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the master <b>designated her</b> to marry him during the six years. Consequently, she cannot be released from his authority by all of the modes through which a Hebrew slave can be freed, as she is his wife.
The Gemara asks: If <b>he designated her, it is obvious</b> that she cannot be released in the manner of a slave, as she is his wife and therefore <b>requires a bill of divorce.</b> The Gemara says: It is necessary to state this explicitly, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>the</b> primary <b><i>halakha</i> is not nullified with regard to her,</b> i.e., even after she has been designated she can still be freed as a slave would be, without a bill of divorce. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that this is referring to a case where he designated her, <b>why does she leave through signs</b> indicating puberty? If he designated her she becomes his wife, and signs indicating the onset of puberty should not affect her status. The Gemara answers: <b>This is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: If he did not designate her, she leaves also through signs</b> indicating puberty.
§ The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>And</b> a Hebrew maidservant is <b>not sold a second time.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>From the fact</b> that the <i>baraita</i> says this about a Hebrew maidservant, it can be inferred that <b>a Hebrew slave can be sold a second time. But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse: “And he is sold <b>for his theft”</b> (Exodus 22:2), means that he can be sold to pay for the items that he has stolen <b>but not</b> to pay <b>for his double payment?</b> Although one can be sold into slavery to reimburse the owner for the principal of his theft, he cannot be sold to pay the fine. Furthermore, <b>“for his theft”</b> indicates: <b>But not</b> to pay <b>for his conspiring testimony.</b> If he is a conspiring witness, who is required to pay the value of what he testified that another had stolen but he does not have the money to do so, he is not sold as a slave. Additionally, the phrase <b>“for his theft”</b> teaches that he can be sold for stealing only once, and <b>once he has been sold one time you may not sell him again.</b>
<b>Rava said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, it is referring <b>to one theft,</b> i.e., he stole a large amount but he is not worth enough as a slave for the proceeds of his sale to repay his entire debt. In that case he cannot be sold a second time. <b>There,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, it is referring to <b>two thefts,</b> as he may be sold a second time if he stole once, was sold, and subsequently stole again.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: The expression <b>“for his theft” indicates</b> even <b>many</b> thefts. <b>Rather, Abaye said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, it is referring <b>to</b> one who stole from <b>one person.</b> This thief cannot be sold a second time even for several thefts. <b>There,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, it is referring <b>to</b> thefts from <b>two people.</b>
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If the <b>property he stole</b> was worth <b>one thousand and</b> as a slave he <b>is worth</b> only <b>five hundred, he is sold and sold again.</b> If the <b>property he stole</b> was worth <b>five hundred</b> and he <b>is worth one thousand, he is not sold at all. Rabbi Eliezer says: If</b> the <b>property he stole was</b> exactly <b>equal to</b> his value if he were <b>sold, he is sold; and if not, he is not sold.</b>
<b>Rava said: In this</b> case <b>Rabbi Eliezer triumphed over the Rabbis, as what is different</b> in a case where the <b>property he stole</b> is worth <b>five hundred and he is worth one thousand</b> that they concede <b>that he is not sold?</b> The reason is that <b>the Merciful One states that he is sold in his entirety, and not part of him. So too,</b> if he is worth less than the value of the property he stole, one can say: <b>The Merciful One states</b> that <b>he is sold for his theft, and he is not sold for part of his theft.</b>
§ The <i>baraita</i> further teaches: <b>And one can redeem</b> a Hebrew maidservant <b>against his will. Rava thought to say</b> that this means <b>against the will of the master,</b> i.e., she can be redeemed even if he refuses. <b>Abaye said to him: What is</b> the mechanism for emancipating her against the will of her master? Is it <b>that one writes a document to him for her value,</b> and when she has the money she repays this debt? <b>Why</b> should it be possible to force the master to free her in this manner? He <b>is holding a pearl [<i>marganita</i>] in his hand</b> and <b>one gives him a shard</b> instead, as this document is currently useless.
<b>Rather, Abaye said:</b> She can be redeemed <b>against the will of</b> her <b>father, due to the family flaw,</b> i.e., the harm caused to the family name by her status. The court pressures the father as much as possible to redeem her, as it is disgraceful to a family if one of its daughters is a maidservant. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, one should force the family of a Hebrew slave</b> to redeem him <b>also, due to the family flaw.</b> The Gemara answers: There is a concern that <b>he will go back and sell himself</b> and earn money in this manner at his family’s expense.
The Gemara asks: <b>Here too,</b> in the case of a Hebrew maidservant, the father <b>might go back and sell her</b> as a maidservant again and receive money for her a second time. The Gemara answers that it <b>is taught:</b> A maidservant <b>is not sold a second time. And whose</b> opinion is this? <b>It is</b> that of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One can sell,</b> i.e., transfer, <b>his</b> young <b>daughter in marriage and</b> go back and betroth her <b>again</b> if she was divorced or widowed. Likewise, he can sell her <b>into slavery and</b> transfer her <b>again,</b> this time <b>for marriage, after</b> he sold her into <b>slavery. But</b> one <b>cannot</b> sell his daughter into <b>slavery after marriage. Rabbi Shimon says: Just as a person cannot sell his daughter into slavery after marriage, so too, a person cannot sell his daughter into slavery after slavery.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this issue is taught <b>in the dispute</b> between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “He shall have no power to sell her to a foreign people, seeing that he has dealt deceitfully with her [<i>bevigdo vah</i>]” (Exodus 21:8).

Daf 18b

This verse indicates that <b>once</b> the master <b>has spread his garment over her,</b> thereby designating her as his wife, her father <b>may no longer sell her.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva,</b> who interprets <i>bevigdo</i> as related to <i>beged</i>, meaning garment. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: “<i>Bevigdo vah</i>”</b> means that <b>since</b> the father <b>dealt deceitfully [<i>bagad</i>] with her</b> and sold her once, <b>he cannot sell her again.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> they <b>disagree? Rabbi Eliezer maintains</b> that <b>the tradition</b> of the manner in which the verses in the Torah are written is <b>authoritative,</b> and one derives <i>halakhot</i> based on the spelling of the words. One relies on the way a word is written, without the traditional vocalization, and therefore it is read as though it were vocalized as <i>bevagdo</i>, which refers to betrayal, not a garment. <b>And Rabbi Akiva maintains</b> that the <b>vocalization</b> of the Torah <b>is authoritative,</b> meaning that one derives <i>halakhot</i> based on the pronunciation of the words, although it diverges from the spelling, and since one pronounces the term as <i>bevigdo</i>, it is related to the word <i>beged</i>, meaning garment. <b>And Rabbi Shimon maintains</b> that both the <b>vocalization</b> of the Torah <b>and the tradition</b> of the manner in which the verses in the Torah are written are <b>authoritative.</b> Consequently, she cannot be sold as a slave after she has been taken as a wife, nor can she be sold again after she has already been sold once.
<b>Rabba bar Avuh raises a dilemma:</b> Does <b>designation</b> of a Hebrew maidservant for betrothal by her master <b>effect marriage or</b> does it <b>effect</b> only <b>betrothal?</b> The <b>practical difference</b> of the outcome of this dilemma is <b>whether he inherits her</b> property, i.e., does her husband inherit her property if she dies as he would if she were married to him; <b>and</b> whether he is obligated to <b>become impure to</b> bury <b>her</b> when she dies, if he is a priest; <b>and</b> whether he can <b>nullify her vows</b> on his own without her father, as is the case with a married woman. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution to this dilemma. <b>“<i>Bevigdo vah</i>”</b> means: <b>Once</b> her master <b>has spread his garment over her,</b> the father <b>may no longer sell her.</b> The Gemara analyzes this statement: This indicates that her father <b>cannot sell her</b> afterward, but he <b>can designate her</b> for another man if the master dies or divorces her. <b>And if you say</b> that designation <b>effects marriage, once she is married her father no longer has authority over her. Rather,</b> is it <b>not</b> correct to <b>learn from this</b> that designation <b>effects</b> only <b>betrothal?</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that this argument can be refuted. <b>Here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is <b>dealing with</b> the <b>ordinary betrothal</b> of one’s daughter, not to one who sells his daughter as a maidservant. <b>And this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: Since her father gave her,</b> i.e., betrothed her, <b>to one who is obligated to</b> provide <b>her food, her clothing, and</b> fulfill <b>her conjugal rights, he can no longer sell her.</b> Therefore, this <i>baraita</i> proves nothing with regard to the issue of whether or not designation effects marriage.
The Gemara cites another relevant source. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear:</b> A father <b>cannot sell</b> his daughter as a maidservant <b>to relatives</b> with whom she is prohibited from engaging in sexual intercourse, as they cannot fulfill the mitzva of designation. <b>They said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: He can sell her to relatives,</b> because designation is merely an option and its inapplicability does not negate the possibility of a sale. <b>And they agree that he can sell her to a High Priest</b> if she is <b>a widow,</b> or <b>to a common priest</b> if she is <b>a divorcée or a <i>yevama</i> who performed <i>ḥalitza</i> [<i>ḥalutza</i>].</b> Although it is prohibited for her to marry these men, their betrothal is effective, and therefore designation is not entirely impossible in these cases.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances of this widow? If we say that</b> she <b>betrothed herself</b> when she was a minor and her husband died, is <b>she called a widow?</b> Since the initial betrothal was entirely ineffective, as a minor cannot accept betrothal independently, she would not be considered his wife. <b>Rather,</b> one must say <b>that her father betrothed her</b> and she was subsequently widowed. But if that is the case, <b>can he sell her? But</b> it was taught that <b>a person cannot sell his daughter into slavery after marriage.</b>
<b>And Rav Amram says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: Here,</b> it is referring <b>to</b> a woman widowed from <b>betrothal of designation, and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, who says: The original money</b> of the sale of the maidservant <b>was not given for</b> the purpose of <b>betrothal</b> but as payment for her work, and if the master wishes to designate her he must give her additional money for that purpose. The relevance of this assertion will be clarified below. The Gemara explains the proof from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>And if you say</b> that designation <b>effects marriage, once she is married her father no longer has authority over her.</b> How can he sell her a second time after the death of her first husband?
The Gemara asks from the other perspective: <b>Rather, what</b> will you say, that designation <b>effects</b> only <b>betrothal?</b> If so, why does the <i>baraita</i> state: <b>And they agree that he can sell her?</b> After all, <b>a person cannot sell his daughter into slavery after matrimony.</b> This <i>baraita</i> also refers to a case where a woman was betrothed but the marriage was not consummated. <b>Rather, what have you to say? Betrothal</b> effected <b>by her is different from betrothal</b> effected <b>by her father.</b> Since the marriage was not performed through her father but by the master giving her additional money, as held by Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, the principle that one cannot sell his daughter into slavery after betrothal does not apply. But by the same reasoning, <b>even</b> if <b>you say</b> that designation <b>effects marriage,</b> you can argue that <b>marriage</b> effected <b>by her is different from marriage</b> effected <b>by her father.</b>
This challenge is rejected: <b>What</b> is <b>this</b> comparison? <b>Granted,</b> one form of <b>betrothal is different from</b> the other <b>betrothal,</b> i.e., there is a difference between standard betrothal with the father’s consent and betrothal through designation, which is performed upon the master’s initiative. After that type of betrothal the father can, in fact, sell her a second time. <b>But</b> with regard to one mode of effecting <b>marriage</b> in relation <b>to</b> another mode of effecting <b>marriage,</b>

Daf 19a

<b>is</b> the matter <b>different?</b> In both cases she is fully released from her father’s authority by Torah law, and therefore he should not be able to sell her again afterward.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the explanation of <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak, who says</b> that <b>even</b> according <b>to Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, the original money</b> of the sale of the maidservant <b>was given for</b> the purpose of <b>betrothal, in accordance with whose</b> opinion does <b>he establish</b> the <i>baraita</i> that permits a father to sell his widowed daughter? After giving her in marriage a father may no longer sell his daughter into slavery. The Gemara explains: <b>He establishes it in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who says: It is for slavery after slavery that he is not able to sell her, but he is able to sell her into slavery after marriage.</b>
§ <b>Reish Lakish raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to the possibility <b>that a person can designate</b> a Hebrew maidservant <b>for his minor son, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara clarifies the sides of this dilemma. Does one learn from the verse: “And if he designates her for <b>his son”</b> (Exodus 21:9), that <b>the Merciful One states</b> that this applies to <b>any son,</b> even if he is too young to be married? <b>Or perhaps</b> it means <b>his son</b> who is <b>similar to him: Just as he is an adult man, so too, his son</b> must be <b>an adult man.</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution to this dilemma from the verse: “And the man who commits adultery with the wife of another man, even he that commits adultery with his neighbor’s wife, both the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death” (Leviticus 20:10). The Sages expounded that the term <b>“man”</b> serves <b>to exclude a minor</b> who commits adultery. The phrase <b>“who commits adultery with the wife of another man”</b> serves <b>to exclude the wife of a minor,</b> as the marriage of a minor is invalid. <b>And if you say</b> that a father can <b>designate</b> a wife for his minor son, and designation effects betrothal or marriage, <b>we find</b> that there is <b>marriage for a minor.</b>
The Gemara challenges this proof: <b>But rather, what</b> will you say, that a master <b>cannot designate</b> a maidservant for his son who is a minor? If so, <b>why does the verse exclude him?</b> If the marriage of a minor is never valid, why is it necessary for the verse to exclude him? On the contrary, <b>resolve from here that one can designate</b> for his minor son. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> One could say that <b>here,</b> when this verse excludes the wife of a minor, <b>we are dealing with a <i>yavam</i></b> who is <b>nine years and one day old who engaged in sexual intercourse with his <i>yevama</i>,</b> and his intercourse is considered valid.
The unique feature of this case is <b>that by Torah law</b> she <b>is fit for him.</b> The <i>halakhot</i> of levirate marriage do not stipulate the minimum age of the <i>yavam</i>. Sexual intercourse with a boy aged nine years and one day is legally considered intercourse, and therefore this verse is necessary, <b>lest you say: Since by Torah law she is fit for him, and his sexual intercourse</b> is considered proper <b>intercourse;</b> therefore, he acquires her and she is his wife in all regards. Consequently, <b>one who engages in intercourse with her becomes liable for</b> violating the prohibition against engaging in intercourse with <b>a married woman.</b> Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that despite this consideration, she is not considered a full-fledged married woman.
The Gemara asks: Ultimately, <b>what</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this matter of designation for a minor son? <b>Come</b> and <b>hear,</b> as <b>Rabbi Aivu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yannai says: Designation applies only to an adult man,</b> and <b>designation applies only with consent.</b> The Gemara asks: Why is it necessary to teach these <b>two</b> <i>halakhot</i> with regard to this matter? It can be derived from the statement that designation requires consent that it applies only to an adult, as a minor is legally incapable of consent. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yannai <b>is saying: What is the reason,</b> i.e., <b>what is the reason</b> that <b>designation applies only to an adult man?</b> It is <b>because designation applies only with consent.</b>
<b>And if you wish, say</b> an alternative explanation. <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term: <b>With consent?</b> It means <b>with her consent. As Abaye, son of Rabbi Abbahu, taught:</b> The verse <b>“who did not designate her [<i>ye’adah</i>]”</b> (Exodus 21:8), <b>teaches that he is required to inform her [<i>ya’adah</i>].</b>
<b>He teaches it and he says it:</b> This is referring <b>to betrothal through designation, and</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, who said: The original money</b> of the sale of the maidservant <b>was not given for</b> the purpose of <b>betrothal.</b> For this reason, an additional act of betrothal must be performed with her consent. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the original money <b>was given for betrothal, it is different here, as the Merciful One states “designate her [<i>ye’adah</i>].”</b> This unusual expression alludes to the <i>halakha</i> that this act must be performed with her consent.
After mentioning the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, several times, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the source in which the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> is stated? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “Who did not <b>designate her, then he shall let her be redeemed”</b> (Exodus 21:8). This juxtaposition indicates that designation applies only when she can be redeemed. Consequently, if she is at the end of her service <b>it is necessary that</b> when he designates her <b>there must be enough time</b> remaining <b>in the day for redemption.</b> There must be sufficient time for her to be redeemed, and if only a short amount of time remains, during which she would be unable to perform work worth one <i>peruta</i>, the master does not have the option of redeeming her.
<b>From here Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: If there is enough time</b> left <b>in the day for her to perform</b> work that is <b>worth one <i>peruta</i> for him, she is betrothed,</b> as he betroths her with the amount she owes him for her work, which is the value of one <i>peruta</i>. <b>And if not, she is not betrothed. Apparently, he maintains</b> that <b>the original money</b> of the sale of the maidservant <b>was not given for</b> the purpose of <b>betrothal.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the original money <b>was given for betrothal,</b> one can explain this <i>halakha</i> as follows: <b>It is different here, as the Merciful One states</b> by means of the juxtaposition: “Who did not designate her, <b>then he shall let her be redeemed,”</b> that by a Torah edict the designation must be performed at a stage when she can still be redeemed.
§ <b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says: A person</b> may <b>say to his minor daughter: Go out and accept your betrothal,</b> and when she accepts the betrothal it is as though she were appointed the father’s agent for her betrothal, despite the fact she is not halakhically competent. From where is this derived? It is derived <b>from that</b> which <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda</b> said.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Didn’t Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, say that the original money</b> of the sale of the maidservant <b>was not given for</b> the purpose of <b>betrothal, and if</b> enough time for <b>her</b> to perform work <b>worth one <i>peruta</i> remains, it is a betrothal?</b> This indicates that when the father sells his daughter he effectively appoints her as her own agent to receive her betrothal, if the master wishes to designate her for himself. At the time of the designation the father receives nothing, while the daughter accepts the value of one <i>peruta</i> for her work as betrothal. <b>Here too, it is no different,</b> and therefore a minor can accept her betrothal with the consent of her father.
<b>And Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> With regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with a loan for which there is collateral,</b> i.e., he relinquishes his claim to a loan that she owes him and he returns the collateral she gave him, <b>she is betrothed.</b> This is derived <b>from that</b> which <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> said. <b>Didn’t Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, say that the original money</b> of the sale of the maidservant <b>was not given for</b> the purpose of <b>betrothal?</b> If so, <b>this</b> daughter’s requirement to serve <b>is</b> similar to <b>a loan,</b> as there is no actual money but only an obligation, <b>and she herself is the collateral.</b> In other words, her body is the security that the loan will be repaid.

Daf 19b

<b>And</b> yet <b>if</b> time for <b>her</b> to perform work <b>worth one <i>peruta</i> remains, and he designates</b> her, <b>it is a betrothal.</b> This shows that he can betroth her with a loan, i.e., the value of the remaining time of her servitude, for which she herself is collateral. <b>Here too, it is no different,</b> and in general one may betroth a woman with a loan for which there is collateral.
§ <b>The Sages taught: How is the mitzva of designation</b> performed? The master <b>says to her before two</b> witnesses: <b>You are hereby betrothed [<i>mekuddeshet</i>] to me,</b> or: <b>You are hereby betrothed [<i>me’oreset</i>] to me.</b> The designation is effective <b>even</b> if he said this <b>at the end of six</b> years of work, <b>and even</b> if it is <b>close to sunset</b> on the last day of her term. <b>And</b> once he designates her <b>he treats her in the manner of marriage and may not treat her in the manner of slavery. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: If there is enough time</b> left <b>in that day for her to perform</b> for <b>him</b> work <b>worth one <i>peruta</i>, she is betrothed, and if not, she is not betrothed.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: This can be understood by way of <b>a parable</b> comparing this <i>halakha</i> <b>to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>one who says to a woman: Be betrothed to me from now after thirty days, and another man came and betrothed her within thirty days.</b> In this case the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that she is betrothed to the first</b> man. The Gemara inquires: <b>According to whom</b> is this <b>parable</b> suggested? Of the two opinions cited in the <i>baraita</i>, whose opinion accords with the <i>halakha</i> in the case of the parable?
<b>If we say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> in the case of the <b>parable is</b> compared <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> didn’t he say: <b>If there is enough time on that day for her to perform</b> for <b>him</b> work <b>worth one <i>peruta</i>, she is betrothed, and if not,</b> she is <b>not</b> betrothed? Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, maintains that she is not considered betrothed conditionally when she is initially acquired as a Hebrew maidservant. Rather, the betrothal takes effect only when he designates her. This is evident from the fact that enough time must remain for her to perform work worth one <i>peruta</i>, as she is betrothed with that amount. If so, one cannot compare his ruling to the case of the parable, where the betrothal of the first was given before that of the second.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> in the case of the <b>parable is</b> compared <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> i.e., the first opinion cited in the <i>baraita</i>, who say that when she was initially acquired as a Hebrew maidservant it is as though he had betrothed her on condition that she would be retroactively betrothed whenever her master desired. This indicates that retroactive betrothal is possible. The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t it obvious</b> that this comparison is correct? Why would the <i>baraita</i> need to state a parable?
The Gemara explains: The <i>baraita</i> needs to state a parable <b>lest you say</b> that the Rabbis hold she is betrothed to the master even if the master <b>did not say to</b> the father that she is betrothed to him <b>from now.</b> The parable therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the case of the master is comparable to a case where the first man said to her: From now, and if the master did not state this term when acquiring her as a Hebrew maidservant, then she is not betrothed to him.
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who</b> first <b>sells his daughter</b> as a Hebrew maidservant <b>and</b> then <b>goes and betroths her to another</b> man, he <b>mocks the master, and she is betrothed to the second</b> man. Although he sold her as a Hebrew maidservant, he can remove her from the authority of the master, and this is seen as mocking him. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Rabbis say: If</b> the master <b>wants to designate</b> her, he can <b>designate</b> her, and the second man’s betrothal is void.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: This can be understood by way of <b>a parable</b> comparing this <i>halakha</i> <b>to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>one who says to a woman: Be betrothed to me after thirty days, and another man came and betrothed her within thirty days.</b> In this case the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that she is betrothed to the second</b> man. The Gemara inquires: <b>According to whom</b> is this <b>parable</b> suggested? Of the two opinions cited in the <i>baraita</i>, whose opinion accords with the <i>halakha</i> in the case of the parable?
<b>If we say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> in the case of the <b>parable is</b> compared <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, don’t the Rabbis say</b> that <b>if</b> the master <b>wants to designate</b> her, <b>he may designate</b> her, and the second man’s betrothal does not take effect? In the case of the parable, she is betrothed to the second man, and the first cannot prevent this.
<b>Rather, Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> in the case of the <b>parable is</b> compared <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t it obvious</b> that this comparison is correct? Why would the <i>baraita</i> need to state a parable?
The Gemara explains: The <i>baraita</i> needs to state a parable <b>lest you say</b> that the case of the Hebrew maidservant is different, as <b>he did not say to her</b> when he acquired her: <b>After thirty days.</b> One might argue that the reason Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, holds that she is not betrothed to the master is that he did not state when he acquired her that she should be designated at a specific time in the future, but if he would have stated this at the time he acquired her as a Hebrew maidservant, the designation would then take effect. By comparing this case to the case of the parable, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, would hold that the designation does not take effect even if the master had said at the time of the acquisition that designation should take effect in thirty days, provided that her father betroths her to another in the interim.
§ <b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who sells his daughter and stipulates</b> with the buyer that the sale applies <b>on the condition that he does not designate</b> her, <b>the condition stands.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: If</b> the master <b>wants to designate</b> her <b>he may designate her, because</b> the father <b>stipulated counter to that which is written in the Torah,</b> as the Torah permits the designation of a Hebrew maidservant. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>anyone who stipulates counter to that which is written in the Torah, his condition is void.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> does <b>his condition stand</b> in that case? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who says to a woman: You are hereby betrothed to me on the condition that you do not have against me</b> any claims of <b>food, clothing, and conjugal rights, she is betrothed and his condition is void;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: With regard to monetary matters,</b> e.g., food and clothing, <b>his condition stands.</b> This indicates that Rabbi Meir maintains that one cannot stipulate counter to that which is written in the Torah.
<b>Ḥizkiyya said:</b> It <b>is different here, as the verse states:</b> “And if a man sells his daughter <b>as a maidservant”</b> (Exodus 21:7), from which it is derived: There are <b>times when he sells her only as a maidservant,</b> not for the sake of marriage. This indicates that the designation of a maidservant is not a Torah obligation but is optional. Therefore, one can issue a stipulation that runs counter to the master designating her.
The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis, what do they do with this</b> phrase: <b>“As a maidservant”?</b> How do they interpret it? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> expression is <b>necessary for them for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states <b>“as a maidservant.”</b> This <b>teaches that he can sell her to</b> people of <b>flawed</b> lineage, e.g., a <i>mamzer</i>, whom she is prohibited from marrying but whose betrothal is effective.
The <i>baraita</i> asks: Why is it necessary to derive that <i>halakha</i> from the verse? <b>But</b> could this <b>not</b> be derived through <b>logical inference: If</b> her father <b>can betroth her to</b> people of <b>flawed</b> lineage, can he <b>not sell her to</b> people of <b>flawed</b> lineage? The <i>baraita</i> answers: The verse is necessary, as <b>what</b> is unique about <b>betrothal to</b> people of <b>flawed</b> lineage is that <b>a person can betroth his daughter</b> even <b>when she is a young woman,</b> i.e., between the ages of twelve and twelve and a half. Therefore, one cannot learn from this that <b>he can</b> also <b>sell her to</b> people of <b>flawed</b> lineage because that case is different, <b>as a person cannot sell his daughter when she is a young woman.</b> The <i>halakha</i> that a person can betroth his daughter even when she is a young woman demonstrates that the rights that a father has with regard to his daughter’s betrothal are more extensive than his right to sell her. Therefore, <b>the verse states “as a maidservant,”</b> which <b>teaches that</b> he can, in fact, <b>sell her to disqualified people.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: If</b> that verse serves <b>to teach that he can sell her to</b> people of <b>flawed</b> lineage, it is unnecessary, <b>as it is already stated: “If she does not please her master,</b> who designated her” (Exodus 21:8). This indicates <b>that she is displeasing in her marriage,</b> i.e., marriage to him was forbidden, and yet the sale is valid. If so, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “as a maidservant”?</b> This <b>teaches that he can sell her</b>

Daf 20a

<b>to relatives,</b> e.g., his father, despite the fact that sexual intercourse between them is prohibited.
The <i>baraita</i> asks: Why is it necessary to derive that <i>halakha</i> from the verse? <b>But</b> could this <b>not</b> be derived through <b>logical inference: If he can sell her to</b> people of <b>flawed</b> lineage, can he <b>not sell her to relatives?</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: The verse is necessary, as <b>what</b> is unique <b>about selling her to</b> people of <b>flawed</b> lineage is <b>that if</b> that master <b>wants to designate</b> her, <b>he can designate</b> her. Although it is prohibited for these people to marry her, nevertheless the betrothal would take effect. Therefore, one cannot learn from this that <b>he can</b> also <b>sell her to relatives.</b> This is a situation <b>where if</b> this master <b>wants to designate</b> her, <b>he cannot designate</b> her, as betrothal is ineffective. Therefore, <b>the verse states “as a maidservant,”</b> which <b>teaches that he can sell her to relatives.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who derived from the term “as a maidservant” that one can stipulate that she cannot be designated, how does he know that one can sell her as a maidservant to people of unflawed lineage or relatives? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives</b> that she can be sold to people of <b>flawed</b> lineage <b>from</b> the verse <b>where Rabbi Eliezer derives</b> it: “If she does not please her master” (Exodus 21:8). <b>With regard to relatives, he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say</b> that <b>he cannot sell her to relatives.</b>
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One can sell</b> his daughter <b>to his father, but he cannot sell her to his son. And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>He cannot sell her to his father nor to his son.</b> The Gemara clarifies this issue: <b>Granted,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that states that <b>he cannot sell her to his father nor to his son</b> is in accordance <b>with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who say that he cannot sell her to relatives whom she cannot marry. <b>But in accordance with whose</b> opinion is the <i>baraita</i> that states that <b>he can sell her to his father but he cannot sell her to his son?</b>
<b>It is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who forbid selling her to any relative, <b>and it is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who permits selling her to all relatives. The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> it is in accordance <b>with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> Although they say he cannot sell her to relatives, <b>the Rabbis concede</b> that he is permitted to do so <b>where there is a possibility of designation.</b> In this case, although the father of the girl’s father cannot marry her, he can designate her as a wife for his other son, who is the girl’s uncle. Since this uncle can marry her, designation is a possibility, and therefore the sale is effective.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> concerning the following verse, which is referring to a Hebrew slave: <b>“If he comes in <i>begappo</i> he shall leave <i>begappo</i>”</b> (Exodus 21:3), which means that if <b>he enters with his body [<i>begufo</i>] he shall leave with his body [<i>begufo</i>]. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> If <b>he enters alone he shall leave alone.</b> The Gemara clarifies. <b>What</b> is the meaning of the ruling that if <b>he enters with his body he shall leave with his body? Rava said:</b> This means <b>to say that he is not released through</b> the loss of his <b>extremities like</b> a Canaanite <b>slave</b> (Exodus 21:26), meaning he does not leave his master because of damage done to his body. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived</b> from a different verse: <b>“She shall not go out as the men slaves do”</b> (Exodus 21:7).
Rava answers: <b>If</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>were</b> derived only <b>from there, I would say:</b> The master <b>should give him the value of the eye</b> that he took out <b>and let him be released.</b> In other words, one could say that the verse which states that a Hebrew maidservant does not leave as Canaanite slaves leave, which would serve as the source for the <i>halakha</i> of a Hebrew slave as well, does not mean that she is not released at all due to the loss of her extremities. Rather, it means that unlike Canaanite slaves, she receives compensation for the injury as well as being released. Therefore, the verse: “If he comes in with his body he shall leave with his body,” <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so. Rather, although the master must reimburse him for the loss of his eye, he is not freed as a result of the injury.
The Gemara discusses the second opinion in the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> If <b>he enters alone, he shall leave alone.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>He shall leave alone? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that <b>this is what</b> Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov <b>is saying:</b> If the Hebrew slave <b>has a wife and children</b> when he is purchased, <b>his master may provide him</b> with <b>a Canaanite maidservant.</b> But if <b>he did not have a wife and children,</b> i.e., he enters alone, <b>his master may not provide him</b> with <b>a Canaanite maidservant.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to a slave who <b>was sold for one hundred dinars and increased</b> in value during his term, <b>and</b> his value <b>stood at two hundred</b> dinars, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> if he wishes to redeem himself <b>one assesses him,</b> for the payment of the remainder of his service, based <b>only</b> on the calculation of <b>one hundred dinars,</b> his value when originally purchased? <b>As it is stated: “Out of the money that he was bought for”</b> (Leviticus 25:51).
If <b>he was sold for two hundred</b> dinars <b>and decreased</b> in value <b>and stood at one hundred dinars, from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> when he is redeemed <b>one assesses him</b> based <b>only</b> on the calculation of <b>one hundred dinars? The verse states: “According to his years</b> he shall give back the price of his redemption” (Leviticus 25:52), meaning that he pays in accordance with the value of his remaining years of service.
<b>I have</b> derived this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in the case of <b>a slave sold to a gentile, since</b> the Torah is lenient with regard to his redemption, as <b>he may be redeemed</b> even <b>by relatives</b> who pay his money and free him. Consequently, in this case the owner <b>is at a disadvantage,</b> and regardless of whether his value increased or decreased the slave always pays the lower amount.
In a case where the slave was <b>sold to a Jew, from where do we</b> derive that this <i>halakha</i> also applies to him? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to a Hebrew slave sold to a Jew: “As <b>a hired worker</b> and as a settler he shall be with you” (Leviticus 25:40), and it states with regard to one sold to a gentile: “As <b>a hired worker</b> year by year he shall be with him” (Leviticus 25:53), <b>for a verbal analogy.</b> This verbal analogy teaches that the same <i>halakha</i> applies to one sold to a gentile as to one sold to a Jew.
When he was in a good mood, <b>Abaye</b> once <b>said: Behold I am like</b> the intellectually sharp <b>ben Azzai,</b> who would regularly expound on the Torah <b>in the markets of Tiberias.</b> I too am ready to answer any question put to me. <b>One of the Sages said to Abaye: After all,</b> with regard to <b>those verses:</b> “Out of the money that he was bought for” and “according to his years,” <b>one could expound them leniently,</b> and assess the cost of redemption at the lower amount. <b>And one could,</b> in equal measure, <b>expound them stringently,</b> i.e., one could say that if a slave was worth more when he was purchased, he pays according to “the money that he was bought for,” and if he increased in value he must pay “according to his years,” i.e., by his present worth. <b>What did you see</b> to cause you to decide <b>to expound them leniently? Let us expound them stringently.</b>
Abaye answered: <b>It cannot enter your mind</b> to expound the verses stringently, as indicated <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One is lenient with regard to</b> a slave and is concerned about his well-being. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states concerning a Hebrew slave: <b>“Because he fares well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:16), which teaches that the slave should be <b>with you,</b> i.e., treated as your equal, <b>in food,</b> meaning that his food must be of the same quality as yours, and <b>with you in drink.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: This means <b>that there shall not</b> be a situation in <b>which you eat fine bread and he eats inferior bread [<i>kibbar</i>],</b> bread from coarse flour mixed with bran, which is low quality. There shall not be a situation in which <b>you drink aged wine and he drinks</b> inferior <b>new wine.</b> There shall not be a situation in which <b>you sleep</b> comfortably <b>on</b> bedding made from <b>soft sheets and he sleeps on straw. From here</b> the Sages <b>stated: Anyone who acquires a Hebrew slave</b> is considered <b>like one who acquires a master for himself,</b> because he must be careful that the slave’s living conditions are equal to his own.
That Sage asked Abaye: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that <b>this</b> leniency in the case of a Hebrew slave <b>applies</b> only <b>to the matter of eating and drinking, so</b> as <b>not to cause him suffering.</b> But with regard <b>to the matter of redemption,</b> perhaps <b>one should be stringent with him.</b> The reason to be stringent is <b>based on</b> a statement <b>of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: Come and see how harsh is</b> the violation of even <b>a hint of the Sabbatical</b> Year, i.e., how great are the punishments not just for working the land, but also for treating lightly the sanctity of Sabbatical-Year produce.
If <b>a person has commercial dealings with Sabbatical-</b>Year <b>produce,</b> which is prohibited, <b>ultimately</b> he will become so poor that <b>he will</b> have to <b>sell his movable property, as it is stated: “In</b> this <b>Jubilee Year you shall return every man to his land”</b> (Leviticus 25:13), <b>and juxtaposed to it</b> is the verse: <b>“And if you sell any item to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor’s hand”</b> (Leviticus 25:14), which is referring to <b>an item acquired</b> by passing it <b>from hand to hand.</b> This teaches that if one sins with regard to the Jubilee Year or the Sabbatical Year, which have many identical <i>halakhot</i>, he will eventually have to sell his movable property.
If one <b>does not sense</b> that he is being punished and does not repent, <b>ultimately he</b> will have to <b>sell his fields, as it is stated</b> in an adjacent verse: <b>“If your brother grows poor and sells of his ancestral land”</b> (Leviticus 25:25). If <b>no</b> move toward repentance <b>comes to his hand, he will</b> have to <b>sell his house, as it is stated:</b> “And if a man <b>sells a dwelling-house in a walled city”</b> (Leviticus 25:29).
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different there,</b> in the first sentence, <b>in</b> which the <i>tanna</i> <b>says: He does not sense, and what is different here,</b> in the continuation, <b>in</b> which he <b>says:</b> If <b>no</b> move toward repentance <b>comes to his hand?</b> The Gemara answers that this is <b>in accordance with</b> a statement <b>of Rav Huna. As Rav Huna says: Once a person commits a transgression and repeats it, it is permitted to him.</b> The Gemara is surprised at this: <b>Can it enter your mind that it is permitted to him</b> merely because he has sinned twice? <b>Rather,</b> say that <b>it becomes to him as though</b> it is <b>permitted.</b> Therefore, when he violates a prohi-bition a second time, the <i>baraita</i> takes for granted that he does not sense that he is performing a sin, and employs a different terminology.
The Gemara resumes its citation of the <i>baraita</i>: If <b>no</b> move toward repentance <b>comes to his hand,</b> his poverty will increase <b>until he sells his daughter, as it is stated: “And when a man sells his daughter as a maidservant”</b> (Exodus 21:7). The Gemara comments: <b>And even though “his daughter” is not written with regard to that matter</b> in Leviticus 25 but in Exodus, nevertheless, <b>it teaches us this</b> principle: <b>A person will sell his daughter rather than borrow with interest</b>. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>His daughter can</b> occasionally <b>deduct</b> money from her debt <b>and</b> use it to <b>leave</b> her master, <b>but this</b> interest <b>continuously increases.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues its exposition of the verses in Leviticus: If <b>no</b> move toward repentance <b>comes to his hand, he</b> will eventually need to <b>borrow with interest, as it is stated: “And if your brother grows poor and his means fails with you”</b> (Leviticus 25:35), <b>and juxtaposed to it</b> is the verse: <b>“Take no</b> usury or interest <b>from him”</b> (Leviticus 25:36). If <b>no</b> move toward repentance <b>comes to his hand, he will</b> eventually need to <b>sell himself, as it is stated: “And if your brother grows poor</b> with you <b>and sells himself to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:39).
The <i>baraita</i> further states: <b>Not</b> only will he be sold <b>to you,</b> a born Jew, <b>but</b> he will even be sold <b>to a stranger, as it is stated:</b> “And sells himself <b>to a stranger [<i>ger</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 25:47). <b>And</b> this sale to a <i>ger</i> is <b>not</b> referring to a sale <b>to a righteous convert [<i>ger tzedek</i>], but</b> even <b>to a gentile who resides in Eretz Yisrael and observes the seven Noahide mitzvot [<i>ger toshav</i>], as it is stated:</b> “And sells himself to <b>a stranger who is a settler [<i>ger toshav</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 25:47). With regard to the continuation of the verse, “or to an offshoot of a stranger’s family,” the Gemara expounds: <b>“A stranger’s family”; this is a gentile,</b> i.e., he will reach a state where he has no choice but to sell himself to a gentile. <b>When it says: “To an offshoot</b> of a stranger’s family,”

Daf 20b

<b>this is</b> referring to <b>one sold for idol worship itself,</b> i.e., he is forced to sell himself as a slave to work in a temple of idol worship. The <i>baraita</i> teaches that it is only due to a person’s sins that he reaches a point where he has to sell himself as a slave. Therefore, one should be stringent with him with regard to his redemption and not allow him to be redeemed easily.
Abaye <b>said to</b> that Sage: <b>There, the verse brings him back,</b> i.e., one must strive to redeem a Jew who has been sold as a slave. <b>As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Since this</b> person who sold himself as a slave <b>has gone and become a priest for idol worship,</b> one might <b>say: Let us throw a stone after the fallen,</b> that is, since he has reached this nadir one should abandon him. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “After he is sold he shall be redeemed; one of his brothers may redeem him”</b> (Leviticus 25:48).
The Gemara further asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> as follows: <b>“He shall be redeemed,”</b> so that <b>he will not be assimilated among the gentiles.</b> But <b>with regard to the matter of</b> his <b>redemption</b> and freedom, <b>let us act strictly with him,</b> as derived <b>from that</b> which <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> said, that one is sold as a slave due to his sins.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Two verses are written</b> with regard to the redemption of a slave sold to a gentile. <b>It is written: “If there be yet many of the years,</b> according to them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for” (Leviticus 25:51), <b>and it is written: “And if there remain but few of the years</b> until the Jubilee Year, and he shall reckon with him, according to his years” (Leviticus 25:52). <b>But</b> how can <b>there be</b> both <b>many years and few years</b> when, in any case, he will not serve for more than six years? <b>Rather,</b> this means that as the <b>money</b> of <b>his</b> value <b>increased</b> with the passage of time, he is redeemed <b>“out of the money that he was bought for,”</b> i.e., the price for which he was originally sold, which is the lower sum. And if <b>his monetary</b> value <b>decreased</b> over time, one determines his value <b>“according to his years,”</b> i.e., according to his current value.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that <b>this is what</b> the Torah <b>is saying:</b> In a case <b>where he served</b> for <b>two</b> years <b>and</b> an additional <b>four years remain for his</b> service, as indicated by the phrase “if there be yet many of the years,” <b>let him give</b> his redemption money for the <b>four</b> years he owes him <b>“out of the money that he was bought for.”</b> If <b>he served four</b> years <b>and two years remain for his</b> service, as is stated “and if there remain but few of the years,” <b>let him give</b> his redemption money the value of the <b>two</b> years, <b>“according to his years.”</b>
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>If so, let the verse write: If there be yet many years,</b> and: <b>If there remain but few years. What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“of the years”?</b> This teaches that if <b>his monetary</b> value <b>increased over the years</b> of his servitude, he is redeemed <b>“out of the money that he was bought for,”</b> which is the lower sum. And if <b>his monetary</b> value <b>decreased over the years</b> of his servitude, one determines his value <b>“according to his years.”</b> Upon hearing this statement, <b>Rav Yosef said: Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak</b> homiletically <b>interpreted these verses like Sinai.</b> His exposition reflects the truth of Torah as it was given at Mount Sinai, as every matter is fully resolved.
The Gemara records <b>a mnemonic</b> device for the upcoming discussions: <b>Slave, house, partial, house, slave,</b> and <b>relatives. Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet:</b> With regard to <b>a Hebrew slave who is sold to a gentile,</b> can he <b>be partially redeemed, or can he not be partially redeemed?</b> Does this slave have the option of paying part of his value and thereby reducing his remaining period of service?
The Gemara analyzes the sides of the dilemma: With regard to a Hebrew slave sold to a gentile, the verse states: “According to his years he shall give back the price of <b>his redemption [<i>ge’ullato</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 25:52), and the meaning of the term “<i>ge’ullato</i>” can be <b>derived from</b> the same term stated with regard to the redemption of an ancestral field: “And he becomes rich and finds sufficient means to <b>redeem it [<i>ge’ullato</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 25:26). Accordingly, <b>just as an ancestral field cannot be partially redeemed,</b> but is either fully redeemed or not at all, <b>so too, this</b> slave <b>cannot be partially redeemed. Or perhaps we say</b> that he cannot be partially redeemed only if that leads <b>to a leniency,</b> but <b>we do not say</b> that he cannot be redeemed if it leads <b>to a stringency.</b>
Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: Didn’t you say there,</b> with regard to a thief who is sold to repay what he stole, that the verse: “And he is sold” (Exodus 22:2), teaches that <b>all of him is sold but not part of him?</b> If he is worth one thousand, and he owes five hundred for theft, he cannot be sold. <b>So too,</b> in the case of one who was sold to a gentile, the phrase <b>“he is redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 25:49) means <b>all of him and not part of him.</b>
<b>Abaye said: If you say</b> that <b>he is partially redeemed, you find</b> elements <b>of leniency and stringency.</b> This ruling can lead <b>to a leniency</b> in the following case: A master <b>purchased</b> a Hebrew slave <b>for one hundred</b> and the redeemer <b>gives him fifty,</b> which is <b>half of his value, and</b> afterward the slave <b>increased</b> in value <b>and stood at two hundred. If you say</b> that <b>he can be partially redeemed</b> he is already half-redeemed. Consequently, the redeemer <b>gives him one hundred,</b> half of his current value, <b>and</b> the slave <b>goes out,</b> i.e., is redeemed. <b>And if you say</b> that <b>he cannot be partially redeemed,</b> the redeemer <b>gives</b> the owner an additional <b>one hundred and fifty and</b> the slave <b>goes out,</b> as the initial fifty serves merely as the first payment, and he is now worth two hundred.
The Gemara asks: <b>But you said</b> that if the <b>money</b> of <b>his</b> value <b>increased,</b> one always pays <b>“out of the money that he was bought for”</b> (Leviticus 25:51), i.e., one calculates the value of the slave in accordance with his value at the time when he was acquired, even if that is less than his present value. Why, then, should one have to pay the full two hundred? The Gemara answers: This is referring to a case <b>where</b> he initially, before being sold, <b>increased in value,</b> was then sold for two hundred, <b>and</b> afterward <b>decreased</b> in value to one hundred, <b>and</b> subsequently he again <b>increased in value</b> so that he was worth the same amount as he was originally. In this case, his value of two hundred remains determinative.
Abaye proceeds to describe how <b>you find</b> a case that leads <b>to a stringency.</b> A master <b>purchased</b> a Hebrew slave <b>for two hundred</b> and the redeemer <b>gave one hundred,</b> which is <b>half of his value, and</b> the slave <b>decreased</b> in value <b>and stood at</b> a value of <b>one hundred. If you say</b> that <b>he can be partially redeemed,</b> the redeemer <b>gives fifty and</b> the slave <b>goes out,</b> i.e., is redeemed. <b>And if you say</b> that <b>he cannot be partially redeemed, these one hundred are a deposit with him.</b> Therefore, the redeemer <b>gives it to him</b> at the time of the redemption <b>and</b> the slave <b>goes out.</b> There is no reason to pay him more money, as he is now worth one hundred.
<b>Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet</b> with regard to a similar topic: In the case of <b>one who sells a house from among the houses of walled cities,</b> which can be redeemed only during the first year after the sale, can it <b>be partially redeemed, or can it not be partially redeemed?</b> The Gemara explains the sides of the dilemma: Does he <b>derive</b> the verbal analogy of <b>“<i>ge’ullato</i>”</b> (Leviticus 25:29) and <b>“<i>ge’ullato</i>”</b> (Leviticus 25:26) <b>from</b> the case of <b>an ancestral field</b> and say that <b>just as ancestral land cannot be partially redeemed, so too, this</b> house <b>cannot be partially redeemed?</b>
<b>Or perhaps</b> one should say: In a case <b>where</b> the verse explicitly <b>revealed</b> that it cannot be redeemed partially, as it does in the context of an ancestral field, <b>it revealed</b> it. With regard to one who redeems an ancestral field, it is written: “And he becomes rich and finds sufficient means to redeem it” (Leviticus 25:26), indicating that he has enough money to redeem the whole field, not part of it. By contrast, in a case <b>where</b> the Torah <b>did not reveal</b> that it cannot be redeemed, <b>it did not reveal</b> it, and therefore a house from a walled city can be partially redeemed, as the verse does not state this condition in that context.
Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: From Rabbi Shimon’s interpretation one learns that</b> with regard to houses in walled cities, <b>one can borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> them, <b>and</b> similarly that one <b>can partially redeem</b> them. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a verse that describes one who consecrates his field: <b>“And if he will redeem [<i>ga’ol yigal</i>]</b> the field” (Leviticus 27:19). The repetition of the verb <b>teaches that one can borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> houses in walled cities <b>and</b> that <b>one can</b> also <b>partially redeem</b> them.
<b>Rabbi Shimon said: What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? This is <b>because we find with regard to one who sells his ancestral field that his power is enhanced, as, if the Jubilee</b> Year <b>arrives and it is not redeemed,</b> the ancestral field <b>returns to its owners in the Jubilee</b> Year without them having to pay for it. Therefore, <b>the power</b> of the seller <b>is diminished in</b> that <b>he cannot borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> the field but must have the money to do so on his own, <b>and</b> he cannot <b>partially redeem</b> it.
By contrast, if <b>one consecrates</b> his field <b>his power is diminished, as, if the Jubilee</b> Year <b>arrives and he did not redeem it</b> in the meantime, and the Temple treasurer sold it to someone else, the ancestral field <b>goes out</b> and becomes the property <b>of the priests in the Jubilee</b> Year and does not return to its original owners. Consequently, in order to offset this stringency <b>his power is enhanced</b> in <b>that he may borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> the field, <b>and partially redeem</b> it.
According to this explanation, with regard to <b>this one who sells a house from among the houses of walled cities, since his power is also diminished, as, if a full year passes and</b> the house <b>has not been redeemed</b> it remains the <b>permanent</b> property of the buyer, in order to offset this stringency, <b>his power</b> should be <b>enhanced in</b> that <b>he may borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> the house, <b>and partially redeem</b> it.
Rava bar Ḥinnana <b>raised an objection to</b> this opinion from a <i>baraita</i>. The verse states with regard to one who consecrates his field: <b>“And if he will redeem [<i>ga’ol yigal</i>]</b> the field” (Leviticus 27:19). This <b>teaches that he may borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> it, <b>and partially redeem</b> it.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>As</b> one <b>might</b> have thought: Could this <b>not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference: Just as</b> with regard to <b>one who sells an ancestral field that his power is enhanced, as if the Jubilee</b> Year <b>arrives and it is not redeemed, it returns to its owners in the Jubilee</b> Year, and yet <b>his power is diminished</b> in <b>that he cannot borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> the field <b>and</b> he cannot <b>partially redeem</b> it; with regard to <b>one who consecrates</b> a field, where <b>his power is diminished, for if the Jubilee</b> Year <b>arrives and it was not redeemed it goes out to the priests in the Jubilee</b> Year, <b>is it not logical that his power is diminished</b> in <b>that he cannot borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> the field <b>and</b> he cannot <b>partially redeem</b> it?
The <i>baraita</i> raises a difficulty against this <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about</b> one who <b>sells his ancestral field</b> is that <b>his power is diminished with regard to redeeming</b> it <b>immediately,</b> as he cannot redeem his field right away but must wait at least two years. Shall <b>you say</b> that the same <i>halakhot</i> apply <b>with regard to one who consecrates</b> his field, <b>as his power is enhanced with regard to redeeming</b> it <b>immediately?</b> One who has consecrated his field can redeem it as soon as he has the money to do so. If so, the <i>a fortiori</i> inference is not valid.
The <i>baraita</i> responds: The case of one who <b>sells a house from among</b> the <b>houses of walled cities can prove</b> otherwise, <b>as his power is enhanced with regard to redeeming</b> it <b>immediately,</b> and yet <b>he cannot borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> the house <b>and</b> he cannot <b>partially redeem</b> it. In any case, with regard to the issue at hand, the <i>baraita</i> indicates the opposite of the previous conclusion: One who sells a house in a walled city cannot partially redeem it. Rav Sheshet answers: This is <b>not difficult.</b>

Daf 21a

<b>This</b> second <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> and <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that one can borrow money and redeem the house and partially redeem it, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>
The Gemara states: It <b>is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> with regard to the houses of walled cities: <b>One can borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> it, <b>and</b> one can <b>partially redeem</b> it, <b>and</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One cannot borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> it, <b>nor</b> can one <b>partially redeem.</b> Apparently, there is a contradiction between these two <i>baraitot</i>. The Gemara answers as above: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> and <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>
The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> device for the names of the Sages who raise the dilemmas cited below and those to whom the questions are addressed: <b><i>Ḥeresh</i>, <i>ḥavash</i>, <i>zeman</i>.</b> They allude to the following interlocutors: <i>Ḥeresh</i> alludes to Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, and Rav Ashi; <i>ḥavash</i> alludes to Rav Aḥa Sava and Rav Ashi; and <i>zeman</i> alludes to Mar Zutra, son of Rav Mari, and Ravina.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi:</b> The comparison detailed earlier (20b) between one who sells a house and one who consecrates a field, <b>can be refuted</b> as follows: <b>What</b> is unique about <b>one who sells a house among the houses of walled cities</b> is that <b>his power is diminished,</b> in that he is not able <b>to redeem</b> it <b>forever,</b> since he cannot redeem it after a year has passed (see Leviticus 25:30). Shall <b>you say</b> the same <b>with regard to one who consecrates</b> his field, <b>as his power is enhanced</b> in that he is able <b>to redeem forever?</b>
<b>Rav Aḥa Sava said to Rav Ashi:</b> The comparison is valid, <b>because it can be said</b> that <b>the argument returns,</b> as one can learn in a different manner. <b>Let</b> this matter <b>be derived by</b> an analogy derived from <b>the common factor</b> of two sources: The <i>halakha</i> of <b>one who sells an ancestral field can prove it, as his power is enhanced</b> in that he is able <b>to redeem</b> the field <b>forever, and he cannot borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> it, <b>and</b> he cannot <b>partially redeem</b> it. And if you say: <b>What</b> is unique about <b>one who sells an ancestral field is that his power is diminished</b> in that he is not able <b>to redeem</b> it <b>immediately,</b> the case of <b>one who sells a house from among houses of walled cities can prove</b> otherwise. Although one can redeem the house immediately, he cannot borrow money and redeem it, nor partially redeem it.
<b>And the derivation has reverted</b> to its starting point, as one could alternate the explanations for each side with their respective refutations. Ultimately, the <b>aspect of this</b> case, an ancestral field, <b>is not like the aspect of that</b> case, a house from among houses of walled cities. <b>Their common denominator is that they can be redeemed, and one cannot borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> them, <b>and</b> likewise, one cannot <b>partially redeem</b> them. <b>I will also bring</b> the case of <b>one who consecrates</b> his field and rule <b>that it may be redeemed, but one cannot borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> it, <b>and</b> one cannot <b>partially redeem</b> it.
<b>Mar Zutra, son of Rav Mari, said to Ravina:</b> This derivation, based on the common denominator, <b>can be refuted</b> as follows: <b>What</b> is unique <b>to their common denominator is that their power is diminished</b> in that they are unable <b>to redeem</b> the respective properties <b>during the second year,</b> as in neither case can they be redeemed in the second year. One who sells a house in a walled city cannot redeem it beyond the first year, while one who sells an ancestral field cannot redeem it during the first two years. Shall <b>you say</b> the same <b>with regard to one who consecrated</b> his field, <b>as his power is enhanced</b> in that he is able <b>to redeem</b> the field <b>in the second year?</b>
<b>Ravina said to him</b> that the derivation is valid <b>because it can be said</b> that the case of <b>a Hebrew slave sold to a gentile can prove</b> otherwise, <b>as his power enhanced</b> in that he is able <b>to redeem</b> himself <b>in the second year, and</b> nevertheless <b>he cannot borrow</b> money <b>and redeem</b> himself, <b>and</b> he cannot <b>partially redeem</b> himself.
The Gemara discusses a similar matter. <b>Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet:</b> In the case of <b>one who sells a house from among the houses of walled cities, can</b> it <b>be redeemed by relatives or can</b> it <b>not be redeemed by relatives?</b> Is the ability to redeem a house limited to the seller himself? The Gemara presents the two sides of the dilemma: Does one <b>derive</b> the verbal analogy of <b>“<i>ge’ullato</i>”</b> (Leviticus 25:29) and <b>“<i>ge’ullato</i>”</b> (Leviticus 25:26) <b>from an ancestral field</b> in this manner: <b>Just as an ancestral field cannot be partially redeemed and</b> yet it <b>can be redeemed by relatives, so too, this</b> house <b>also cannot be partially redeemed and</b> yet <b>it can be redeemed by relatives?</b>
<b>Or perhaps, when</b> the word <b><i>ge’ula</i> is written</b> in the case of an ancestral field, <b>it is written with regard to partial</b> redemption; but the word redemption <b>is not written with regard to relatives.</b> If so, the verbal analogy does not apply to the <i>halakha</i> of redemption by relatives. Rav Sheshet <b>said to him:</b> The house <b>cannot be redeemed</b> by relatives.
Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana <b>raised an objection to</b> the ruling of Rav Sheshet from a <i>baraita</i> that deals with the verse: “And <b>in all</b> of your ancestral land <b>you shall grant redemption</b> for the land” (Leviticus 25:24). This verse serves <b>to include houses and a Hebrew slave. What, is it not</b> correct to say that the term houses is referring to <b>houses of walled cities,</b> indicating that they can also be redeemed by relatives? The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> this is referring to <b>houses in open areas</b> without walls.
The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>houses in open areas</b> without walls, <b>it is explicitly written: “Shall be reckoned with the field of the country”</b> (Leviticus 25:31), meaning that they are like ancestral fields. If so, there is no need for another verse to teach this <i>halakha</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse: “And in all of your ancestral land you shall grant redemption for the land” (Leviticus 25:24), serves <b>to establish</b> that redemption by relatives is <b>an obligation, and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with regard to a verse that deals with one who sells ancestral land: <b>“And he shall redeem that which his brother has sold”</b> (Leviticus 25:25), this redemption is <b>optional,</b> i.e., if he wishes to do so he may redeem the land. Do <b>you say</b> that it is <b>optional or is it nothing other</b> than <b>an obligation? The verse states</b> concerning an ancestral field that was sold: <b>“And if a man has no one to redeem it”</b> (Leviticus 25:26). This verse is puzzling: <b>But is there a man in Israel who does not have redeemers?</b> Every Jew has a relative of some sort, even if he must trace his family tree back all the way to Jacob. <b>Rather,</b> this is referring to <b>one who has</b> a relative <b>who does not want to purchase,</b> i.e., redeem, the land, <b>as he has permission</b> to refrain from doing so, since this redemption is optional. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua.</b>
<b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that when the verse states: <b>“And he shall redeem that which his brother has sold,”</b> this redemption is <b>an obligation.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that it is <b>an obligation, or is it only optional? The verse states:</b> “And <b>in all</b> of your ancestral land <b>you shall grant redemption</b> for the land” (Leviticus 25:24). Here <b>the verse established it as obligatory.</b> This is the interpretation of the verses according to Rabbi Eliezer.
<b>The Sages said to Rav Ashi, and some say Ravina</b> said this <b>to Rav Ashi: Granted, according to the one who says</b> that the verse serves <b>to include houses of walled cities, this is as it is written “in all.”</b> “In all” serves to include a case omitted by the phrase “you shall grant a redemption for the land.” <b>But according to the one who says</b> that it serves <b>to include houses in open areas</b> without walls, <b>what</b> is meant by the term <b>“in all”?</b> It was already taught that these houses are included in the category of ancestral fields, and therefore they are referred to by the expression “redemption for the land.” No answer was found to this question and the Gemara states that it is <b>a difficulty.</b>
<b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> this opinion that houses in walled cities cannot be redeemed by relatives. It is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> does it mean when <b>the verse states: “May redeem him,” “may redeem him,”</b> and <b>“may redeem him”</b> (Leviticus 25:48–49), <b>three times?</b> This serves <b>to include all redemptions,</b> and <b>that they are redeemed in this order:</b> In the case of a Hebrew slave sold to a gentile, if he does not redeem himself he can be redeemed by a brother; if he is not redeemed by a brother, then he can be redeemed by an uncle or some other relative. <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that this inclusion is referring to <b>houses of walled cities and a Hebrew slave,</b> that they too can be redeemed by relatives? The Gemara rejects this interpretation: <b>No,</b> it includes <b>houses in open areas and an ancestral field.</b>
The Gemara asks: But the cases of <b>houses in open areas and</b> the case of <b>an ancestral field</b> are <b>written explicitly: “Shall be reckoned with the field of the country”</b> (Leviticus 25:31). The Gemara answers: This is <b>as Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said,</b> that the verse detailing the redemption by relatives stated with regard to an ancestral field teaches that <b>the closer</b> of a relative one is to the seller, the <b>earlier</b> one is in the order of redeeming the ancestral field. The obligation or merit to redeem the field applies first to one who is more closely related to the seller. <b>So too,</b> with regard to houses in open areas, this verse teaches that <b>the closer</b> of a relative one is to the seller, the <b>earlier</b> one is in the order of redeeming the house.
The Gemara asks: <b>Where was</b> this opinion <b>of Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak</b> originally <b>stated?</b> The Gemara answers that it was stated <b>with regard to this</b> issue, <b>as a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Can <b>a Hebrew slave sold to a Jew be redeemed by</b> his <b>relatives or can he not be redeemed by</b> his <b>relatives?</b> The Gemara comments: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>you should not raise the dilemma, as he says: One who is not redeemed by these</b> relatives <b>is redeemed by six</b> years of service. <b>Evidently,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that a Hebrew slave sold to a gentile <b>cannot be redeemed</b> by his relatives.
<b>When you raise the dilemma,</b> it is <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Does one <b>derive</b> the verbal analogy comparing <b>“hired worker”</b> (Leviticus 25:40) and <b>“hired worker”</b> (Leviticus 25:53) from the case of a Jew sold to a gentile, and say that just as one can be redeemed by one’s relatives if sold to a gentile, so too, one can be redeemed if sold to a Jew? <b>And</b> at the same time <b>one does not interpret homiletically</b> the phrase <b>“may redeem him”</b> (Leviticus 25:48), stated with regard to one sold to a gentile, as a restricting term. <b>Or perhaps</b> the phrase <b>“may redeem him”</b> is in fact a restricting term, which indicates that this <i>halakha</i> applies only <b>to this</b> slave, i.e., only one sold to a gentile can be redeemed by relatives, <b>and</b> it does <b>not</b> apply <b>to another</b> slave, one sold to a Jew.
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: “And <b>in all</b> of your ancestral land <b>you shall grant redemption</b> for the land” (Leviticus 25:24). The inclusive expression “in all” serves <b>to include houses and a Hebrew slave. What, is it not</b> correct to say that this includes <b>houses of walled cities and a Hebrew slave sold to a Jew?</b> The Gemara rejects this interpretation: <b>No,</b> one can say that this is referring to <b>a Hebrew slave sold to a gentile.</b>
The Gemara asks: It is <b>explicitly written with regard to a Hebrew slave sold to a gentile: “Either his uncle or his uncle’s son may redeem him”</b> (Leviticus 25:49). If so, it is unnecessary to derive the option of redemption by a relative from an inclusive expression in a different verse.

Daf 21b

The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse serves <b>to establish</b> that redeeming him is <b>an obligation. And even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> who says that there is no requirement to redeem land, this case is different, as it is proper to redeem him to prevent him from being assimilated by gentiles.
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “May redeem him,” “may redeem him,”</b> and <b>“may redeem him”</b> (Leviticus 25:48–49), <b>three times?</b> This serves <b>to include all redemptions,</b> and <b>that they are redeemed in this order. What, is it not</b> correct to say that this inclusion is referring both to <b>houses of walled cities and a Hebrew slave sold to a Jew,</b> that they can be redeemed by relatives? The Gemara rejects this interpretation: <b>No,</b> it includes <b>houses in open areas and an ancestral field.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Concerning houses in open areas and an ancestral field, it is written explicitly: “Shall be reckoned with the field of the country”</b> (Leviticus 25:31). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This teaches that <b>the closer</b> of a relative one is to the seller, the <b>earlier</b> one is in the order of redeeming the house or the field. This is the context of Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak’s statement.
§ The Gemara returns to the mishna, which teaches: <b>And</b> a Hebrew slave <b>who is pierced</b> after serving six years <b>is acquired</b> as a slave for a longer period <b>through piercing his ear with an awl.</b> The Gemara explains that this is <b>as it is written: “And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl,</b> and he shall serve him forever” (Exodus 21:6).
The mishna further teaches that a pierced slave <b>acquires himself through</b> the advent of <b>the Jubilee</b> Year <b>and through the master’s death.</b> The Gemara explains that this is <b>as it is written: “And he shall serve him</b> forever” (Exodus 21:6). This term indicates that he serves only the master, <b>but not the son and not the daughter.</b> The term <b>“forever”</b> is referring <b>to</b> the <b>forever</b> represented <b>by the Jubilee</b> Year. The word “forever” does not mean for eternity, but refers to the end of the cycle of the Jubilee Year.
<b>The Sages taught:</b> From the term <b>“an awl” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a master can pierce the ear of a Hebrew slave <b>with an awl. From where</b> do I derive that <b>a sharp thorn [<i>sol</i>], a thorn [<i>sira</i>], a needle, an auger, and a stylus</b> used to engrave in wax may be used? <b>The verse states: “And you shall take</b> the awl” (Deuteronomy 15:17). This term “and you shall take” serves <b>to include any implement that can be taken in the</b> master’s <b>hand.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> Not all of these utensils may be used for piercing. <b>Just as an awl is unique</b> in that it is made <b>of metal, so too any</b> tool made <b>of metal</b> can be used; one may not pierce a slave’s ear with non-metal implements. <b>Alternatively,</b> the verse states: “And you shall take <b>the awl,” to include the large awl</b> for piercing.
<b>Rabbi Elazar said: Yudan the Distinguished would teach</b> as follows: <b>When they pierce, they pierce only the earlobe. And the Rabbis say:</b> The piercing is not performed on the earlobe, as the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>a Hebrew slave</b> who is <b>a priest is not pierced</b> at all <b>because</b> the piercing <b>renders him blemished</b> and unfit to serve in the Temple. <b>And if you say</b> that <b>they pierce</b> a slave’s <b>earlobe, how does a Hebrew slave</b> who is <b>a priest become blemished</b> through piercing? A pierced earlobe is not considered a blemish. This indicates that <b>he is pierced only on the upper part of the ear</b> through the cartilage. The Gemara inquires: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, <b>disagree?</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>expounds</b> the verses by means of the hermeneutical principle of reading the verse as consisting of <b>generalizations and details.</b> Accordingly, he maintains that the term <b>“and you shall take”</b> is <b>a generalization</b> that indicates piercing may be performed with any implement. <b>“An awl”</b> is <b>a detail,</b> and when the verse states: <b>“Through his ear and into the door”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:17), <b>it then generalized</b> again. When the verse writes <b>a generalization and a detail and a generalization, you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail: Just as the explicit detail</b> mentions an awl, which is made <b>of metal, so too, any</b> utensil used for piercing must be made <b>of metal.</b>
By contrast, <b>Rabbi Yosei expounds</b> the verses by means of the hermeneutical principle of reading the verse as consisting of <b>amplifications and restrictions.</b> Accordingly, he learns that the term <b>“and you shall take” amplifies,</b> i.e., it includes any item that can be taken in one’s hand. The term <b>“an awl” restricts.</b> When the verse states <b>“through his ear and into the door,” it then amplifies again.</b> When the verse <b>amplifies, restricts, and amplifies, it has amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i> to include <b>everything</b> except one item.
<b>What has it amplified,</b> i.e., included beyond an awl? <b>It has amplified</b> the category to include <b>everything</b> that can pierce an ear. <b>What has it restricted</b> from inclusion in the category? It excludes only the method that is most dissimilar to the use of an awl, which is <b>a corrosive substance.</b> Producing a hole in the slave’s ear with a substance of this kind is not a valid form of piercing.
<b>The Master said</b> above: <b>“The awl,”</b> this serves <b>to include the large awl</b> for piercing. The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred</b> that this expression is referring to a large awl? The Gemara answers that this is <b>as Rava said</b> with regard to the verse: “The sinew of the thigh vein which is upon the hollow of <b>the thigh”</b> (Genesis 32:33), that this is referring to <b>the most important [<i>meyummenet</i>]</b> part of <b>the thigh.</b> The definite article indicates something clear and obvious. <b>Here too,</b> the term <b>“the awl”</b> is referring to <b>a special awl.</b>
It was further stated in the above <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Yudan the Distinguished would teach: When they pierce</b> a slave <b>they pierce only the earlobe. And the Rabbis say: A Hebrew slave</b> who is <b>a priest is not pierced</b> at all, <b>because</b> piercing <b>renders him blemished.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> let him be pierced and <b>be rendered blemished</b> and disqualified for Temple service. Why is it prohibited to do this? <b>Rabba bar Rav Sheila says: The verse states</b> concerning a Hebrew slave at the end of his servitude: <b>“And he shall return to his own family”</b> (Leviticus 25:41), i.e., <b>to his status in his family.</b> He must be able to return to the position he had as a member of his family. If he was rendered a blemished priest while a slave, once he is emancipated he can no longer return to his status as a priest who can perform the Temple service.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to <b>a Hebrew slave</b> who is <b>a priest, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning the permissibility <b>for his master to provide him</b> with <b>a Canaanite maidservant</b> with whom to engage in sexual intercourse? The Gemara analyzes the two sides of the dilemma: Does one say that the <i>halakha</i> permitting a Hebrew slave to engage in intercourse with a Canaanite maidservant <b>is</b> a halakhic <b>novelty,</b> as a Jew is generally prohibited from engaging in intercourse with a gentile, and in light of this novelty, <b>it is no different</b> in the case of <b>priests and no different</b> in the case of <b>an Israelite?</b>
<b>Or perhaps</b> the case of <b>priests is different</b> from Israelites, <b>since the Torah includes additional mitzvot for them,</b> which do not apply to all Jews. Therefore, it is prohibited for a priest to engage in sexual intercourse with a Canaanite maidservant, despite the fact she is permitted to a non-priest. The <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to this issue. <b>Rav said: It is permitted</b> for the master to provide him with a Canaanite maidservant, <b>and Shmuel said it is prohibited.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman said to Rav Anan: When you were</b> studying <b>in the house of Mar Shmuel</b> did <b>you play with tokens [<i>iskumadri</i>]?</b> Didn’t you take your studies seriously? <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>you do not say</b> a proof <b>to him from that</b> which we learned: <b>And the Rabbis say: A Hebrew slave</b> who is <b>a priest is not pierced</b> at all <b>because</b> piercing <b>renders him blemished.</b>
Rav Naḥman explains the proof: <b>And if you say</b> that <b>if his master cannot provide him</b> with <b>a Canaanite maidservant,</b> it is not even relevant to suggest that a slave of priestly lineage could be pierced, as the fact that he cannot be pierced <b>could be derived</b> from another point, <b>as I require</b> the slave to say: <b>“I love my master, my wife, and my children”</b> (Exodus 21:5), <b>and</b> that declaration <b>cannot</b> be issued by a priest if his master may not provide him with a Canaanite maidservant. And <b>nothing more</b> can be answered to this proof. The reason given by the Rabbis proves that a Canaanite maidservant can be provided even to a priest.
Similarly, <b>a dilemma was raised before them: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the permissibility <b>for a priest</b> who goes to war to engage in intercourse <b>with a beautiful woman</b> captured in that war? Does one say that the case of a beautiful woman <b>is a novelty</b> in that the Torah permits a man to engage in intercourse with a gentile woman? Consequently, it <b>is no different</b> in the case of <b>a priest and no different</b> in the case of <b>an Israelite,</b> as both are permitted to engage in intercourse with this woman. <b>Or perhaps</b> the case of <b>priests is different, since</b> the Torah <b>includes additional mitzvot for them? Rav said:</b> It is <b>permitted, and Shmuel said:</b> It is <b>prohibited.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>With regard to the first act of sexual intercourse</b> between the soldier priest and the gentile woman, <b>everyone agrees that</b> it is permitted, <b>as the Torah spoke only in response to the evil inclination,</b> and the evil inclination of a priest is as strong as that of an Israelite. This passage serves to prevent intercourse performed in a prohibited manner, which is relevant to a priest as well.
<b>When they disagree</b> it is <b>with regard to the second act of sexual intercourse.</b> Is a priest permitted to bring the captive into his house, convert her, and marry her? <b>Rav said</b> it is <b>permitted, and Shmuel said</b> it is <b>prohibited.</b> Their reasoning is as follows: <b>Rav said</b> it is <b>permitted: Since</b> she was <b>permitted</b> to him once, she remains <b>permitted</b> to him. <b>And Shmuel said</b> it is <b>prohibited, as</b> ultimately <b>she is a convert, and a convert is not fit to</b> marry <b>a priest.</b>
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of this dispute. <b>With regard to the second act of intercourse everyone agrees that it is prohibited, as she is a convert,</b> and a priest may not marry a convert. <b>When they disagree</b> it is <b>with regard to the first act of intercourse. Rav said</b> it is <b>permitted, as the Torah spoke only in response to the evil inclination. And Shmuel said it is prohibited,</b> as <b>any</b> situation <b>that one can read with regard to it: “Then you shall bring her home to your house”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:12), <b>one</b> can also <b>read</b> and fulfill <b>with regard to</b> the earlier command of: <b>“And see among the captives</b> a beautiful woman, and you have a desire for her, and would take her to you as a wife” (Deuteronomy 21:11). Conversely, <b>any</b> situation <b>that one cannot read with regard to it: “Then you shall bring her home to your house,”</b> i.e., if the soldier may not marry her, <b>one does not read with regard to it: “And sees among the captives,”</b> and one may not engage in sexual intercourse with her.
<b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to a beautiful captive, the verse states: <b>“And sees among the captives,”</b> teaching that this <i>halakha</i> applies only if he notices her <b>when she is a captive.</b> The expression <b>“a woman”</b> teaches that she is permitted <b>even</b> if she is <b>a married woman.</b> The phrase <b>“a beautiful woman”</b> indicates that <b>the Torah</b> here <b>spoke only in response to the evil inclination,</b> as it is due to her beauty that he desired her. And why does the Torah permit this? <b>It is preferable for Jews to eat the meat</b>

Daf 22a

<b>of dying animals</b> that were <b>slaughtered, and let them not eat the meat of dying animals</b> that were not slaughtered but which will become <b>carcasses.</b> In other words, it is preferable for this act to be performed in a somewhat permitted way rather than in a manner that is entirely prohibited. The expression: <b>“And you have a desire</b> for her and would take her to you as a wife” (Deuteronomy 21:11), teaches that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>even if she is not pretty,</b> as this is a subjective judgment dependent on one’s desire. The term <b>“for her”</b> indicates that he may take her, <b>but not her and another</b> woman. A soldier is allowed to take only one captive in this manner.
The phrase <b>“and would take her”</b> teaches: <b>You have</b> the ability to <b>take her,</b> i.e., to marry her. <b>“To you as a wife”</b> teaches <b>that he may not take two women, one for him and one for his father,</b> or <b>one for him and one for his son.</b> The verse: <b>“Then you shall bring her</b> home into your house” (Deuteronomy 21:12), <b>teaches that he should not pressure her</b> to engage in sexual intercourse <b>during the war,</b> but he should first take her into his home.
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> It is stated with regard to a pierced slave: <b>“But if</b> the slave <b>shall say [<i>amor yomar</i>]:</b> I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go out free” (Exodus 21:5). The repeated verb teaches that he is not pierced <b>unless he says</b> this statement <b>and repeats</b> it. If <b>he said at the beginning</b> of his <b>six</b> years of service that he wants to be pierced, <b>but he did not say</b> it <b>at the end of six</b> years, <b>he is not pierced, as it is stated: “I will not go out free,”</b> i.e., he is not pierced <b>unless he says</b> it <b>when he leaves.</b>
If <b>he said</b> this statement <b>at the end of six</b> years <b>but did not say</b> it <b>at the beginning of</b> his <b>six</b> years, he is likewise <b>not pierced, as it is stated: “If the slave shall say [<i>amor yomar</i>],”</b> which indicates that he is not pierced <b>unless he states</b> it <b>while he is</b> still <b>a slave.</b> This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> above: If <b>he said</b> it <b>at the beginning of</b> his <b>six</b> years <b>and he did not say</b> it <b>at the end of six</b> years, <b>he is not pierced, as it is stated: “I will not go out free.”</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> does the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> learn this <i>halakha</i> <b>specifically from</b> the phrase <b>“I will not go out free”? Let him derive</b> it from the fact <b>that we require</b> another condition. He has to be able to say: <b>“I love my master, my wife, and my children”</b> (Exodus 21:5) in order to become a pierced slave, <b>and</b> he <b>cannot</b> say this, as at the start of the six years he does not yet have children from the Canaanite maidservant his master provided for him.
<b>And furthermore,</b> the <i>baraita</i> states that if <b>he said</b> this statement <b>at the end of six</b> years <b>but did not say</b> it <b>at the beginning of</b> his <b>six</b> years, he is likewise <b>not pierced, as it is stated “the slave.” Is that to say</b> that <b>he is not a slave at the end of six</b> years? <b>Rava said: What</b> is the meaning of: <b>At the beginning of six?</b> This is not referring to the actual beginning of his six years of service, but <b>to the beginning of</b> the <b>last <i>peruta</i>,</b> i.e., when he reaches the start of his final stage of work worth one <i>peruta</i>, when he is still a slave. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of the term: <b>At the end of six? At the end of</b> the <b>last <i>peruta</i>.</b>
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If the slave <b>has a wife and children and his master does not have a wife and children, he is not pierced, as it is stated: “Because he loves you and your house”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:16). The word “house” is referring to a wife and children, and therefore if the master does not have a wife and children the verse cannot be fulfilled, and the slave is not pierced. Similarly, if <b>his master has a wife and children and he does not have a wife and children, he is not pierced, as it is stated: “I love my master, my wife, and my children”</b> (Exodus 21:5).
Furthermore, if <b>he loves his master but his master does not love him, he is not pierced, as it is stated: “Because he fares well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:16), which indicates that it is good for both of them to be with each other. If <b>his master loves him but he does not love his master, he is not pierced, as it is stated: “Because he loves you.”</b> If <b>he is ill and his master is not ill, he is not pierced, as it is stated: “Because he fares well with you,”</b> which excludes a sick person. Similarly, if <b>his master is ill and he is not ill, he is not pierced, as it is stated “with you,”</b> which equates the well-being of the pair.
<b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye raised a dilemma:</b> If <b>both of them are ill, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we require</b> only that the slave be <b>“with you,”</b> i.e., in the same condition as the master, <b>and that is</b> the case <b>here,</b> as they are both ill, and the slave can be pierced? <b>Or perhaps we require “because he fares well with you,”</b> i.e., it must be good for both of them, <b>and that is not</b> the case <b>here,</b> as they are both ill. If so, he cannot be pierced. No answer was found, and therefore the Gemara says that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states concerning a Hebrew slave: <b>“Because he fares well with you,”</b> which teaches that the slave should be <b>with you,</b> i.e., treated as your equal, <b>in food,</b> meaning that his food must be of the same quality as yours, and <b>with you in drink.</b> This means <b>that there shall not</b> be a situation in <b>which you eat fine bread and he eats inferior bread,</b> bread from coarse flour mixed with bran, which is low quality. There shall not be a situation in which <b>you drink aged wine and he drinks</b> inferior <b>new wine.</b> There shall not be a situation in which <b>you sleep</b> comfortably <b>on</b> bedding made from <b>soft sheets and he sleeps on straw. From here</b> the Sages <b>stated: Anyone who acquires a Hebrew slave</b> is considered <b>like one who acquires a master for himself,</b> because he must be careful that the slave’s living conditions are equal to his own.
<b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to a verse that deals with the emancipation of a slave: <b>“Then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him”</b> (Leviticus 25:41). <b>Rabbi Shimon said:</b> This verse is puzzling, as, <b>if he is sold, are his sons and daughters sold?</b> Rather, <b>from here</b> it is derived that <b>his master is obligated to</b> provide <b>sustenance for his children,</b> and when the slave is emancipated his sons are released as well. <b>You say something similar</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“If he is married then his wife shall go out with him”</b> (Exodus 21:3). <b>Rabbi Shimon said: If he is sold, is his wife sold?</b> Rather, <b>from here</b> it is derived <b>that his master is obligated to</b> provide <b>sustenance for his wife.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And it is necessary</b> for the <i>baraita</i> to mention both cases, <b>as if it</b> had <b>taught us</b> only that the master is required to provide sustenance for the slave’s <b>children,</b> one might say that this is <b>because they are not fit to work and eat.</b> Since they are unable to support themselves, the master is required to support them. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>his wife, who can eat and work,</b> one might <b>say</b> that <b>she should work and eat</b> in payment for her work, and the master is not required to support her for free.
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if</b> the <i>baraita</i> had <b>taught us</b> only about <b>his wife,</b> one might say that the master is required to support her <b>since it is not her manner to circulate</b> and collect charity, as she is too embarrassed to do this. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>his children, since it is their manner to circulate</b> and beg, i.e., this is not beneath their dignity, one might <b>say no,</b> he is not required to support them. Therefore it is <b>necessary</b> to issue both rulings.
<b>The Sages taught:</b>

Daf 22b

<b>Had</b> the verse <b>stated: His ear to the door, I would say: He should pierce, opposite his ear, into the door</b> alone. In other words, with regard to <b>the door, yes,</b> it should be pierced, but <b>his ear</b> itself, <b>no,</b> it should not be pierced. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> how could it even be suggested that <b>his ear</b> should <b>not</b> be pierced? <b>But isn’t it written: “And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl”</b> (Exodus 21:6)?
<b>Rather, I would say</b> that the master <b>should pierce his ear outside,</b> i.e., not at the door, <b>and he should place it</b> afterward <b>on the door, and</b> then <b>he should pierce opposite his ear on the door.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And you shall take the awl and place it <b>through his ear and into the door”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:17). <b>How so? He bores through</b> his ear <b>until he reaches the door.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> adds: Since the verse states <b>“door,” I</b> would <b>derive</b> that this applies to any door, regardless of <b>whether</b> it is <b>detached</b> from its doorpost or <b>whether it is not detached.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Then his master shall bring him to the court, and shall bring him to the door, or to the <b>doorpost”</b> (Exodus 21:6): <b>Just as a doorpost is upright</b> and attached, <b>so too, a door</b> must be <b>upright</b> and attached to the doorpost.
<b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai would expound this verse as a type of decorative wreath [<i>ḥomer</i>],</b> i.e., as an allegory: <b>Why is the ear different from all the other limbs in the body,</b> as the ear alone is pierced? <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said:</b> This <b>ear heard My voice on Mount Sinai when I said: “For to Me the children of Israel are slaves”</b> (Leviticus 25:55), which indicates: <b>And</b> they should <b>not</b> be <b>slaves to slaves. And</b> yet <b>this</b> man <b>went and</b> willingly <b>acquired a master for himself.</b> Therefore, <b>let</b> this ear <b>be pierced.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Shimon bar Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>would</b> likewise <b>expound this verse as a type of decorative wreath: Why are the door and a doorpost different from all other objects in the house,</b> that the piercing is performed with them? <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: The door and the doorpost were witnesses in Egypt when I passed over the lintel and</b> when I passed <b>over the two doorposts</b> of houses in which there were Jews (Exodus, chapter 12), <b>and I said: “For to Me the children of Israel are slaves,” and</b> they should <b>not</b> be <b>slaves to slaves. And I delivered them</b> at that time <b>from slavery to freedom, and</b> yet <b>this</b> man <b>went and acquired a master for himself.</b> Therefore, <b>let him be pierced before them,</b> as they are witnesses that he violated God’s will.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A Canaanite slave is acquired by</b> means of <b>money, by</b> means of <b>a document, or by</b> means of the master <b>taking possession</b> of him. <b>And he can acquire himself,</b> i.e., his freedom, <b>by</b> means of <b>money</b> given <b>by others,</b> i.e., other people can give money to his master, <b>and by</b> means of <b>a bill</b> of manumission if he accepts it <b>by himself.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> The slave can be freed <b>by</b> means of <b>money</b> given <b>by himself, and by</b> means of <b>a bill</b> of manumission if it is accepted <b>by others, provided that the money</b> he gives <b>belongs to others,</b> not to him. This is because the slave cannot possess property, as anything owned by a slave is considered his master’s.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that these are the modes by which a slave can be acquired? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written</b> with regard to Canaanite slaves: <b>“And you shall bequeath them to your children as an ancestral inheritance”</b> (Leviticus 25:46). <b>The verse juxtaposes</b> Canaanite slaves <b>to an ancestral field: Just as an ancestral field can be acquired by</b> means of <b>money, by</b> means of <b>a document, or by</b> means of the owner <b>taking possession</b> of it, <b>so too, a Canaanite slave can be acquired by</b> means of <b>money, by</b> means of <b>a document, or by</b> means of the master <b>taking possession</b> of him.
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> so, perhaps one can interpret this juxtaposition differently: <b>Just as an ancestral field returns to its owners in the Jubilee</b> Year, <b>so too a Canaanite slave returns to his</b> prior <b>owners in the Jubilee</b> Year. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Of them you may take your slaves forever”</b> (Leviticus 25:46), which indicates that the sale is permanent.
A Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that a Canaanite slave can <b>also</b> be acquired <b>by</b> means of symbolic <b>exchange,</b> i.e., a <i>pro forma</i> act of acquisition performed by the giving of an item, usually a kerchief, effecting the transfer of ownership of an article. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why doesn’t <b>the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna mention acquisition through symbolic exchange? The Gemara answers: He <b>teaches</b> only the effectiveness of <b>modes</b> of acquisition <b>which are not</b> effective in transferring the ownership <b>of movable property,</b> as it is a novelty that these are effective, as one may have thought that a slave can be acquired only in the same manner as movable property is acquired. He does <b>not teach</b> the effectiveness of <b>modes</b> of acquisition <b>which are</b> effective in transferring the ownership <b>of movable property,</b> as it is not a novelty that a slave can be acquired in that manner.
<b>Shmuel says: A Canaanite slave can be acquired by</b> means of <b>pulling,</b> as can movable property. <b>How</b> is pulling performed in the case of a slave? If the master <b>took him by force and</b> the slave <b>came to him, he has</b> thereby <b>acquired him.</b> But if the master <b>called him and he came to him</b> willingly, <b>he has not acquired him.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna, it is clear why he did not list pulling as a mode of acquisition, as <b>he</b> does <b>not teach</b> the effectiveness of <b>modes</b> of acquisition <b>that are</b> effective in transferring the ownership <b>of movable property;</b> he <b>teaches</b> only the effectiveness of <b>modes</b> of acquisition <b>that are not</b> effective in transferring the ownership <b>of movable property.</b> Pulling is effective with movable property. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i>,</b> who taught the mode of symbolic exchange, <b>let him teach pulling</b> as well. The Gemara answers: <b>When he teaches</b> his <i>baraita</i>, which includes acquisition through symbolic exchange, he teaches the effectiveness of <b>modes</b> of acquisition <b>that are</b> effective in transferring the ownership of <b>both land and movable property. He does not teach</b> the effectiveness of <b>pulling, which is</b> effective in transferring the ownership <b>of movable property</b> but <b>is not</b> effective in transferring the ownership <b>of land.</b>
The Gemara returns to analyze Shmuel’s statement: <b>How</b> does one acquire a slave through pulling? If the master <b>took him by force and he came to him,</b> he has <b>acquired him.</b> If <b>he called him and he came to him,</b> he has <b>not acquired him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> has he <b>not</b> acquired him if <b>he called him? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How</b> is an animal acquired <b>through passing?</b> If <b>he grabbed it by its hoof,</b> or <b>by its hair,</b> or <b>by the saddle on it,</b> or <b>by the load [<i>shalif</i> ] on it,</b> or <b>by the bit [<i>bifrumbiya</i>] in its mouth,</b> or <b>by the bell on its neck, he has acquired it.</b>
<b>How</b> is an animal acquired <b>by pulling?</b> If <b>he calls it and it comes, or he</b> if <b>hits it with a stick and it runs before him, once it lifts a foreleg and a hind leg</b> from where it was standing, he <b>acquires it. Rabbi Asi, and some say Rabbi Aḥa, says:</b> It is not enough if the animal lifts its feet. Rather, one does not acquire it <b>until it walks</b> the distance of <b>its full height in the presence of</b> the one acquiring it. In any event, this indicates that calling is an effective use of the mode of pulling.
The Sages <b>say</b> in response that there is a difference between the acquisition of a slave and that of an animal. <b>An animal walks by the will of its owner,</b> as it is domesticated and follows the orders of its master. Consequently, if it comes when called it is as though it was pulled. By contrast, <b>a slave walks by his own will.</b> Consequently, even if a slave comes when called, this cannot be considered acquisition through pulling, as the master has performed no act of acquisition. <b>Rav Ashi said: A slave who is a minor is considered like an animal.</b> Since he has no will of his own, he can be acquired through calling, like an animal.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:5): <b>How</b> does one acquire a slave <b>though possession?</b> If the slave <b>removes</b> the master’s <b>shoe,</b> or <b>carries his garments after him to the bathhouse,</b> or <b>undresses him,</b> or <b>bathes him,</b> or <b>anoints him,</b> or <b>scrubs</b> the oil off him, or <b>dresses him,</b> or <b>puts on his shoes, or lifts him,</b> the master <b>acquires him. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> Acquisition through the mode of <b>possession should not be considered greater than</b> acquisition using the mode of <b>lifting, as lifting acquires</b> property <b>in any situation.</b> With regard to this last statement the Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>saying</b> here? The first <i>tanna</i> also said that a slave can be acquired by lifting.
<b>Rav Ashi says</b> that one can infer from the statement of the first <i>tanna</i>: If a slave <b>lifts his master,</b> the master <b>acquires him,</b> as he is performing labor for the master. But if <b>his master lifts</b> the slave, the master <b>does not acquire him,</b> as the slave has not performed labor for his master. With regard to this <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> Acquisition through <b>possession should not be greater than</b> acquisition through <b>lifting, as lifting acquires</b> property <b>in any situation.</b> Consequently, one can acquire a slave even by lifting him.
The Gemara asks: <b>Now that you said</b> that if a slave <b>lifts his master,</b> the master <b>acquires him,</b> consider the following ramification of this ruling: <b>If that is so, let a Canaanite maidservant be acquired by</b> means of <b>sexual intercourse</b> with the master, as it is possible to claim she lifts him during the act of intercourse. The Gemara answers: <b>When we say</b> that one acquires a slave through the labor the slave performs for him, that applies to a situation where <b>this</b> master <b>benefits and that</b> slave <b>suffers.</b> In this manner the master exercises his authority over the slave. <b>Here,</b> with regard to sexual intercourse, <b>it is</b> a case where <b>this</b> master <b>benefits and this</b> Canaanite maidservant likewise <b>benefits.</b> Since both sides derive benefit, it cannot be seen as an act of acquisition.
The Gemara asks: If he engages in intercourse <b>in an atypical manner,</b> i.e., anal intercourse, with her, <b>what can be said?</b> In that case the woman does not benefit from the intercourse. <b>Rav Aḥai bar Adda of</b> the place called <b>Aḥa said: Who will tell us,</b> i.e., it is not obvious, <b>that there is no benefit for both of them,</b> i.e., there is benefit only for the man, when they engage in intercourse in an atypical manner? <b>And furthermore, it is written: “Lyings with a woman”</b> (Leviticus 18:22). The plural form indicates that there are two ways of engaging in sexual intercourse with a woman: In this manner <b>the verse compares typical</b> sexual intercourse <b>to</b> intercourse in <b>an atypical manner.</b>
§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Yehuda from India was a convert who had no heirs.</b> When <b>he became ill Mar Zutra entered to ask</b> about his health. When he <b>saw that his condition intensified,</b> i.e., that he was about to die, Mar Zutra <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda’s <b>slave: Remove my shoes and take them to my house.</b> He wanted to acquire the slave upon the death of his master, as when a convert without heirs dies, the first person to claim his property acquires it. The Gemara comments: <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that this slave <b>was an adult man,</b>

Daf 23a

and <b>this</b> person, Rabbi Yehuda from India, <b>departed to death, and that</b> individual, Mar Zutra, <b>departed to life</b> by receiving a slave.
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that this slave <b>was a minor, and</b> Mar Zutra did <b>not</b> act <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a convert who dies</b> without heirs <b>and Jews plundered his property,</b> as it is considered ownerless, <b>and among</b> his possessions <b>were slaves,</b> then, <b>whether</b> the slaves were <b>adults or minors, they acquire</b> ownership of <b>themselves</b> and become <b>freemen,</b> as they can acquire themselves from the ownerless property. <b>Abba Shaul says: Adult</b> slaves <b>acquire</b> ownership of <b>themselves</b> and become <b>freemen.</b> But with regard to <b>minor</b> slaves, <b>anyone who takes possession of them acquires them.</b> According to the opinion of Abba Shaul, Mar Zutra did not have to hasten to acquire the slave during Rabbi Yehuda’s lifetime before the slave would acquire himself. He could have waited until Rabbi Yehuda died before acquiring the slave.
§ The mishna teaches that a slave can acquire himself <b>by</b> means of <b>money,</b> and Rabbi Meir rules that this money must be given by others. The Gemara comments: This ruling indicates that <b>with money</b> given <b>by others, yes,</b> the slave can be freed in this manner, <b>but not by</b> giving money <b>himself.</b> The Gemara inquires: <b>With what are we dealing? If we say</b> that this is referring to emancipating the Canaanite slave <b>without his consent,</b> that creates a difficulty. <b>After all, we have heard</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir</b> is the one <b>who says: It is against the slave’s interest to leave his master’s authority for freedom,</b> as he thereby loses out on certain benefits; <b>and we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One can act in a person’s interest in his absence, but one can act against a person’s interest only in his presence.</b> How can one act against the slave’s interest and free him without his consent?
<b>Rather,</b> it <b>is obvious</b> that this slave was freed <b>with his consent, and</b> the mishna <b>teaches us this:</b> With money given <b>by others, yes,</b> the slave can be freed in this manner, but <b>by</b> giving money <b>himself, no,</b> he cannot be freed in this manner, despite his consent. <b>Evidently, a slave has no acquisition without his master.</b> It is impossible for a slave to perform an independent act of acquisition, as everything acquired by him immediately belongs to his master. Consequently, he cannot be in possession of money with which he can acquire himself. Instead, the money must be given to his owner by somebody else.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: He can be freed <b>by</b> means of <b>a bill</b> of manumission if he accepts it <b>by himself.</b> The Gemara analyzes this ruling: If he accepts it <b>by himself, yes,</b> but if it is accepted <b>by others, no,</b> he cannot acquire his freedom in this manner. <b>And if</b> this document is produced <b>with</b> the slave’s <b>consent,</b> as claimed above, <b>why</b> is it <b>not</b> effective if it is accepted <b>by others?</b>
The Gemara adds: <b>And if you would say</b> in response: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: If he accepts it <b>by himself?</b> This means that in addition to being freed if the bill of manumission is accepted by others, <b>he can also</b> be freed if he accepts it <b>by himself, and</b> according to <b>this</b> interpretation the mishna <b>teaches us this,</b> that <b>his bill</b> of manumission <b>and his ability</b> to acquire himself <b>come simultaneously.</b> In other words, although he did not have the legal power to acquire himself while he was still a slave, when he receives his bill of manumission he attains this ability at that same moment. The Gemara explains why this interpretation of the mishna is problematic: <b>But</b> Rabbi Meir <b>did not teach this</b> ruling, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A slave can be freed <b>by</b> means of <b>a bill</b> of manumission if he accepts it <b>by himself, but not</b> if it is accepted <b>by others;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>Abaye said: Actually,</b> according to Rabbi Meir the mishna is referring to a case where the master received money <b>without</b> the slave’s <b>consent, and</b> acquisition effected with the giving of <b>money is different: Since it acquires him against his will</b> from another master, as the slave’s consent is not necessary in that case, it likewise <b>acquires him for himself against his will.</b> His consent is not required, despite the fact that it is against his interest to be freed.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that a slave can be freed with the giving of money without his consent is predicated on the <i>halakha</i> that he can be acquired by means of the giving of money to his previous master without his consent, he should <b>also</b> be freed with <b>a document</b> if it is accepted by others without his consent. The Gemara answers: <b>This document is discrete, and this document is discrete,</b> i.e., the comparison between the acquisition of a slave and his emancipation is invalid in the case of a document, as a document of sale is not similar to a bill of manumission.
The Gemara asks: <b>Here too, this money is discrete and this money is discrete,</b> as the money is given for a different purpose in the cases of acquisition and manumission. The Gemara answers: <b>In any event, the coin</b> itself <b>is one,</b> i.e., there is no noticeable difference between the coin used for acquisition of a slave and one that would be used for emancipating him. The same cannot be said with regard to documents, as particular texts serve specific purposes, and the same document could not be used for both acquiring a slave and emancipating him.
<b>Rava said</b> the following distinction: With regard to emancipation by means of <b>money, his master’s receipt</b> of the money <b>causes him</b> to be freed, not the giving of the money by others. Therefore, they are not considered to have harmed the slave without his consent. By contrast, in the case of <b>a document,</b> the <b>receipt</b> of the document <b>by others</b> on behalf of the slave <b>causes him</b> to be freed, and one can incur liability for another person only in his presence.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The slave can be freed <b>by</b> means of <b>money</b> given <b>by himself.</b> The Gemara analyzes this ruling: <b>By</b> means of <b>money</b> given <b>by himself, yes,</b> he can be emancipated in this manner, but with money given <b>by others, no,</b> he cannot be emancipated in this manner. The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> not? <b>Although</b> this was <b>indeed</b> performed <b>without</b> the slave’s <b>consent, after all, we heard that the Rabbis say: It is in</b> a slave’s <b>interest to go out from the master’s authority to freedom. And we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One can act in a person’s interest in his absence, but one can act against a person’s interest only in his presence.</b> Why, then, isn’t he freed when others give the money, considering that this change of status is to his advantage?
<b>And if you would say: What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>By</b> means of <b>money</b> given <b>by himself?</b> This means that not only can he be redeemed by means of money given to others but he can be redeemed <b>even by</b> means of money given to <b>himself, and it teaches us that a slave has</b> the ability to receive <b>an acquisition without his master. If so, say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: He can be freed <b>by</b> means of <b>a bill</b> of manumission if it is accepted <b>by others.</b> This indicates: If it is accepted by others <b>but not</b> if he accepts it <b>by himself. And</b> yet <b>we maintain</b> that according to the Rabbis <b>his bill</b> of manumission <b>and his ability to acquire</b> his freedom <b>come simultaneously.</b> If so, why can’t he be freed through a document he accepts by himself?
<b>And if you would say: What</b> is the meaning of: If it is accepted <b>by others?</b> This means that not only can he be emancipated if he accepts the bill of manumission by himself, but he can <b>even</b> be freed if it is accepted <b>by others, and</b> the mishna <b>teaches us this:</b> That <b>it is in a slave’s interest to go out from the master’s authority to freedom. If so,</b> there is no difference between emancipation by means of money and emancipation by means of a document, and therefore <b>let us combine them and teach them</b> together and say: A slave can be freed <b>by</b> means of <b>money and by</b> means of <b>a bill</b> of manumission, <b>whether by others</b> or <b>whether by himself.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> it is clear that there is a difference between money and a document. When he is emancipated <b>by</b> means of <b>money,</b> a slave can be freed <b>whether</b> by means of money given <b>by others</b> or <b>whether</b> by means of money given <b>by himself.</b> In the case <b>of a bill</b> of manumission, he can be emancipated if it is accepted <b>by others but not</b> if he accepts it <b>by himself. And</b> this latter clause <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> A slave can <b>also</b> be freed <b>with a bill</b> of manumission if it is accepted <b>by others but not</b> if he accepts it <b>by himself. And</b> there are <b>three disputes with regard to the matter.</b> There are the opinions of Rabbi Meir, the Rabbis, and Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar.
<b>Rabba said: What is the reason of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar? He derives</b> this by means of a verbal analogy, understanding the meaning of <b>“to her [<i>lah</i>],”</b> written with regard to a maidservant in the verse: “Nor was freedom given to her” (Leviticus 19:20), <b>from</b> the meaning of <b>“for her [<i>lah</i>],”</b> written with regard to <b>a wife:</b> “And he writes for her a bill of divorce” (Deuteronomy 24:3). <b>Just as a woman</b> is not divorced <b>until</b> the husband <b>moves</b> the <b>bill of divorce</b> from his domain <b>to a domain that is not his,</b> and the bill of divorce is ineffective as long as it remains in his domain; <b>so too, a slave</b> is not freed <b>unless</b> the master <b>moves</b> the <b>bill</b> of manumission <b>to a domain that is not his.</b> Since the slave belongs to him, the document will remain the master’s even if he gives it to the slave. Therefore, he can be freed by means of a document only through other people who receive the document on his behalf.
<b>Rabba raises a dilemma:</b>

Daf 23b

<b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar,</b> in the case of <b>a Canaanite slave, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the possibility <b>that</b> a slave <b>can appoint an agent to accept his bill</b> of manumission <b>from the hand of his master?</b> Does one say that <b>since</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar <b>derives</b> the verbal analogy of <b>“<i>lah</i>”</b> and <b>“<i>lah</i>” from a woman,</b> which teaches that a slave can be freed with a document, therefore, a slave is also <b>like a woman</b> in that he too can appoint an agent?
<b>Or perhaps,</b> in the case of <b>a woman, as she can accept her bill of divorce</b> herself, <b>she can also appoint an agent,</b> whereas <b>a slave</b> is different, <b>as he cannot accept his bill</b> of manumission himself, and consequently <b>he cannot appoint an agent either. After raising the dilemma,</b> Rabba <b>subsequently resolved it:</b> Since Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar derives the verbal analogy of <b>“<i>lah</i>”</b> and <b>“<i>lah</i>” from a woman,</b> a slave is also treated <b>like a woman</b> with regard to his ability to appoint an agent.
The Gemara comments: <b>But</b> consider <b>that which Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says</b> with regard to the service in the Temple: <b>These priests are the agents of the Merciful One,</b> i.e., they perform the Temple service as the emissaries of God. <b>As if it enters your mind</b> that <b>they are our agents, is there anything that we cannot do but</b> agents <b>can do</b> on our behalf? Since it is prohibited for non-priests to serve in the Temple, priests cannot be considered the agents of the Jewish people.
This statement leads to the following question: <b>But</b> is it <b>not</b> true that an agent can be appointed to perform a task that cannot be done by the one who sent him? <b>But</b> according to Rava’s conclusion there is the case of <b>a slave, who is unable to accept his bill</b> of manumission <b>himself, and</b> yet <b>he can appoint an agent</b> to receive it for him.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>And</b> that <b>is not so.</b> The difference between the cases is that <b>an Israelite is not involved in the <i>halakhot</i> of offerings at all,</b> as a non-priest is never permitted to sacrifice offerings. By contrast, <b>a slave is</b> somewhat <b>involved in bills</b> of manumission, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>It seems that a slave can accept the bill</b> of manumission <b>of another</b> slave <b>from the hand of the master of</b> that <b>other</b> slave. <b>But</b> he <b>cannot</b> accept a bill of manumission <b>from the hand of his own master,</b> who wishes to free another of his slaves. In this case there is no acquisition, as the document has not left the master’s property, as anything given to a slave is considered the property of his master. With regard to the issue at hand, since a slave can accept a bill of manumission, at least on behalf of another slave, the <i>halakhot</i> of these documents are relevant to him, and therefore he can appoint an agent to receive his bill of manumission.
§ The mishna teaches that according to Rabbi Meir the slave can be freed by means of money given by others, while the Rabbis hold that he can be freed by means of money given by himself, <b>provided that the money</b> he gives <b>belongs to others.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>they disagree with regard to this</b> principle, and <b>that Rabbi Meir maintains: There is no acquisition for a slave without his master,</b> i.e., a slave has no personal property and therefore his master immediately owns whatever the slave acquires, which means a slave cannot receive his redemption money himself. <b>And</b> similarly <b>there is no acquisition for a woman without her husband. And the Rabbis maintain: There is acquisition for a slave without his master, and there is acquisition for a woman without her husband.</b>
<b>Rabba said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said: Everyone agrees</b> that <b>there is no acquisition for a slave without his master, and there is no acquisition for a woman without her husband, and</b> so, <b>with what are we dealing here?</b> This is a unique case in <b>which another</b> individual <b>transferred one hundred dinars to</b> a slave <b>and said to him:</b> I am giving this to you <b>on the condition that your master has no rights to it.</b>
The Gemara clarifies the two opinions according to this explanation. <b>Rabbi Meir maintains</b> that <b>when</b> this third party <b>said to</b> the Canaanite slave: <b>Acquire</b> the money, the <b>slave acquires</b> it and <b>his master</b> immediately <b>acquires</b> it. <b>And when he said to him: On the condition</b> that your master has no rights to it, <b>he has said nothing to him,</b> i.e., his condition is ineffective. <b>And the Rabbis maintain</b> that <b>since he said to him: On the condition, his condition is effective</b> and the master does not acquire the money. Therefore, the slave owns this money, with which he can redeem himself.
<b>And Rabbi Elazar said:</b> In <b>a case like this, everyone agrees that</b> the <b>slave acquires</b> the money, <b>and his master</b> automatically <b>acquires</b> that which was acquired by the slave. <b>And with what are we dealing here,</b> in the dispute between the Sages and Rabbi Meir? This is referring to a case <b>where another</b> person <b>transferred one hundred dinars to him and said to him: On the condition that you are emancipated with it.</b>
The Gemara explains the dispute according to this interpretation. <b>Rabbi Meir maintains</b> that <b>when he said to him: Acquire</b> the money, the <b>slave acquires</b> it, <b>and his master</b> immediately <b>acquires</b> the one hundred dinars from him. <b>And when he said to him: On the condition, he has said nothing to him. And the Rabbis maintain: He</b> does <b>not transfer</b> the money <b>to</b> the slave himself, <b>as he said to him only: On the condition that you are emancipated with it.</b> In other words, he gave it to the slave only for him to hand over the money to his master for his emancipation. His condition is valid and the slave is emancipated.
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> between one statement <b>of Rabbi Meir and</b> a second statement <b>of Rabbi Meir, and</b> it <b>raises a contradiction between</b> one statement of <b>the Rabbis</b> and a second statement of <b>the Rabbis. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:

Daf 24a

<b>A woman may not redeem</b> her husband’s <b>second tithe without</b> adding <b>one-fifth</b> of its value to the redemption money, as is required from all those who redeem their own second tithe. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Meir: A woman may redeem second tithe without</b> adding <b>one-fifth.</b> The Gemara inquires: <b>What are the circumstances? If we say</b> that she redeems second tithe <b>with</b> her <b>husband’s money,</b> which he gave her for this purpose, <b>and the tithe</b> belongs <b>to</b> her <b>husband,</b> in this case <b>she acts</b> with <b>the agency of</b> her <b>husband.</b> Just as he is required to add one-fifth when he redeems his own second tithe, it is clear that she too must add one-fifth.
<b>But rather,</b> one might say that this is referring <b>to</b> a case where she uses <b>her money and</b> it is <b>his tithe.</b> This is also difficult, as in this case the Rabbis would agree that she is exempt from paying the additional fifth, as <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And if <b>a man</b> shall redeem any of his tithe” (Leviticus 27:31). The emphasis of the term “man” teaches: This applies to a man, <b>but</b> this does <b>not</b> apply to <b>a woman</b> who redeems her husband’s tithe.
<b>Rather, is it not</b> correct to say that we are dealing with <b>a case like this</b> following one: <b>Where another</b> person <b>transferred one hundred dinars to her, and said to her:</b> I am giving this to you <b>on the condition that you redeem</b> your husband’s <b>tithe with it? And</b> if so, <b>we heard them</b> say the <b>opposite</b> with regard to the issue of whether such a condition is effective. According to Rabbi Meir’s reasoning presented in the case of a slave, anything a woman acquires should be acquired by her husband, which would mean that it is as though her husband himself redeemed it. How, then, could Rabbi Meir rule that a woman redeems second tithe with adding one-fifth? Additionally, the Rabbis said that the money received by the slave is not immediately acquired by his master, and yet here they consider the money received by the wife as belonging to her husband.
<b>Abaye said: Reverse</b> the opinions in the case of redemption of tithes. <b>Rava said: Actually do not reverse</b> them, <b>and here, with regard to tithes, we are dealing with tithe she received from her father’s house</b> as an inheritance. <b>And Rabbi Meir</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he says: Tithe is property</b> that belongs to the <b>Temple</b> treasury, <b>and</b> therefore <b>the husband does not acquire it,</b> unlike the regular property a woman brings to her marriage. Consequently, a woman can redeem it with her husband’s money without adding one-fifth, as the husband is not the owner of the tithe.
<b>And the Rabbis</b> conform <b>to their</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as they say: Tithe is common,</b> i.e., non-sacred, <b>property.</b> It is not owned by the Temple treasury. <b>And</b> consequently, the <b>husband acquires it</b> like other property of his wife, to whose profits he is entitled. <b>Therefore, she performs</b> with <b>the agency of</b> her <b>husband</b> and must add the fifth.
§ A Sage <b>taught:</b> A Canaanite slave <b>is emancipated through a tooth and an eye and</b> through permanent damage to other <b>extremities that do not regenerate</b> if they are severed. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, a tooth and an eye,</b> these body parts are explicitly <b>written,</b> as the Torah states clearly that if a master damages a tooth or blinds an eye the slave is emancipated (Exodus 21:26–27). <b>But from where do we</b> derive that if the master permanently damages other <b>extremities</b> the slave is likewise emancipated? The Gemara answers: These extremities are <b>similar to a tooth and an eye: Just as</b> the removal of <b>a tooth and an eye</b> leads to <b>exposed,</b> i.e., external, <b>blemishes that do not regenerate, so too,</b> the same applies to <b>all blemishes</b> caused by the slave’s master that are <b>exposed and that do not regenerate.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that the examples of <b>a tooth and an eye are like two verses that come as one,</b> i.e., they teach the same matter, <b>and</b> there is a principle that <b>any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> their <i>halakha</i> so that it can be applied to other cases. If so, a slave should be emancipated only for an injury to a tooth or an eye. The Gemara answers: It is <b>necessary</b> to mention both a tooth and an eye, as neither <i>halakha</i> could not be derived from the other. Consequently, they are not considered to be like two verses that come as one. The Gemara elaborates: <b>As, if the Merciful One had written</b> only <b>tooth, I would say</b> that <b>even</b>

Daf 24b

<b>a milk tooth,</b> a child’s tooth that will eventually fall out to be replaced by another, is included in this <i>halakha</i>. Therefore <b>the Merciful One writes “eye,”</b> to teach that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to a body part that does not regenerate, like an eye. <b>And if the Merciful One had written</b> only <b>“eye,” I would say</b> that <b>just as an eye was created with him</b> in the womb, <b>so too,</b> this <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>anything that was created with him</b> in the womb. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a tooth,</b> which grows later, perhaps he would <b>not</b> be emancipated if his master knocked it out. Therefore, <b>it is necessary</b> to mention both cases.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> the following argument: <b>“If</b> a man <b>smites”</b> (Exodus 21:26), is <b>a generalization; “a tooth” and “an eye”</b> are each <b>a detail.</b> If so, this should be read as <b>a generalization and a detail,</b> and the hermeneutical principle in a case of this kind is that <b>the generalization includes only what is</b> mentioned explicitly <b>in the detail.</b> Consequently, <b>a tooth and an eye are</b> included, but <b>not other matters.</b>
The Gemara answers that when each verse states: <b>“To freedom shall he send him”</b> (Exodus 21:26, 27), <b>it then generalized</b> again. Consequently, this should be read as <b>a generalization and a detail and a generalization.</b> In this case, the hermeneutical principle is that <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail: Just as the explicit detail</b> is <b>an exposed blemish</b> that <b>does not regenerate</b> itself, <b>so too, any</b> body parts that are <b>exposed blemishes and that do not regenerate</b> themselves are included in this <i>halakha</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> so, one can limit this category even further: <b>Just as with the explicit details,</b> they are referring to <b>exposed blemishes and</b> the body part <b>is prevented from</b> performing <b>its</b> regular <b>function and does not regenerate, so too,</b> a slave should be emancipated as a result of an injury to <b>all exposed blemishes that do not regenerate and</b> where the body part <b>is prevented from</b> performing <b>its</b> regular <b>function. Why,</b> then, <b>is it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the master <b>pulled out his beard and dislocated a bone in</b> the slave’s jaw, <b>the slave is emancipated by means of</b> this injury. In this case there is no loss of function. The Gemara answers: <b>“To freedom shall he send him”</b> (Exodus 21:26–27), <b>is an amplification,</b> which includes an injury that is not exactly the same as the detail.
The Gemara asks: <b>But if it is an amplification,</b> which includes additional injuries, the slave should <b>also</b> be emancipated <b>even if he struck him on his hand and it withered,</b> i.e., became temporarily paralyzed, <b>but would eventually</b> be expected to <b>regenerate. Why,</b> then, <b>is it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>he struck him on his hand and</b> the hand <b>withered but</b> it <b>will eventually regenerate, the slave is not emancipated by means of</b> this injury? The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> that even limbs that will eventually regain their function are included in this <i>halakha</i>, <b>what</b> purpose do the examples of <b>tooth and eye serve?</b> These two items that are explicitly stated in the verse would not exclude anything. Rather, only injuries similar to the details of an tooth and an eye are included, but not temporary injuries.
<b>The Sages taught: With regard to any of</b> the twenty-four extremities, if a master strikes his slave and injures him there, <b>the slave is emancipated by means of</b> these injuries, <b>and</b> he <b>requires a bill of manumission</b> from his master. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Meir says: He does not require</b> a bill of manumission. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: He requires</b> one. <b>Rabbi Tarfon says: He does not require</b> one. <b>Rabbi Akiva says: He requires</b> one.
<b>Those who</b> discuss matters and <b>decide before the Sages say</b> the following compromise: <b>Rabbi Tarfon’s statement appears</b> correct <b>with regard to a tooth and an eye, since</b> in these cases <b>the Torah</b> explicitly <b>benefitted him.</b> Because his right to emancipation is stated explicitly in the verse, the slave does not require a bill of manumission. <b>And Rabbi Akiva’s statement</b> is reasonable <b>with regard to other limbs, since it is a rabbinic penalty.</b> The Gemara is puzzled by this claim: <b>Is it</b> a rabbinic <b>penalty? We interpret</b> the <b>verses,</b> and therefore this <i>halakha</i> applies to the other limbs by Torah law. <b>Rather,</b> these Sages meant that is necessary to give a bill of manumission <b>since it is a rabbinic interpretation</b> and is not written explicitly in the Torah.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Shimon? He derives</b> a verbal analogy between: <b>Sending away,</b> “to freedom shall he send him” (Exodus 21:26, 27), and: <b>Sending away,</b> “and sends her out of his house” (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>from</b> the case of <b>a woman. Just as a woman</b> can be released from her husband only <b>by</b> means of <b>a document, so too, a slave</b> can <b>also</b> be released from his master only <b>by</b> means of <b>a document. And Rabbi Meir</b> would say that <b>if</b> the term <b>“freedom” was written at the end</b> of the phrase, i.e., if the verse had stated: He shall send him away to freedom, it would be <b>as you said,</b> that he must be given a bill of manumission before he can be emancipated. <b>Now that it is written “to freedom shall he send him,”</b> this indicates that <b>he is free from the beginning,</b> i.e., no additional act of emancipation is required.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Kamma</i> 9:26): If a slave owner <b>struck</b> his slave <b>on his eye and blinded him,</b> or <b>on his ear and deafened him, the slave is emancipated by means of these</b> injuries. If he struck <b>near his eye and</b> as a result <b>he does not see,</b> or <b>near his ear and he does not hear, the slave is not emancipated by means of these</b> injuries. <b>Rav Shemen said to Rav Ashi: Is this to say that a sound</b> that causes damage <b>is nothing?</b>
<b>But didn’t Rami bar Yeḥezkel teach</b> a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a rooster that stuck its head into the airspace of a glass vessel and crowed into it and</b> the noise <b>broke it,</b> its owner <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage</b> like a regular case of damage. <b>And Rav Yosef said</b> that the Sages of <b>Rav’s study hall say:</b> With regard to <b>a horse that neighed or a donkey that brayed and they</b> thereby <b>broke vessels in the house,</b> their owners must <b>pay</b> for <b>half</b> of <b>the damage.</b> Although these two examples are different, as one results in full payment and the other in half payment, it is clear that sound can be a source of liability for damages.
Rav Ashi <b>said to him: A person is different, as, since he is</b> mentally <b>competent it is he who frightened himself.</b> It was not the physical sound that caused the damage but the slave’s subjective fear, which is not a direct result of the action. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Kamma</i> 6:16) that injury can result from being frightened: <b>One who frightens another</b> and causes him injury is <b>exempt according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven. How so?</b> If <b>one shouted into</b> another’s <b>ear and deafened him,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> But if <b>he held him and shouted into his ear and deafened him,</b> he is <b>liable</b> according to human laws as well, as he took physical hold of him. Once he physically took hold of him, he is liable for all the resultant damage.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Kamma</i> 9:9): In a case where the master <b>struck him on his eye and weakened</b> his vision without blinding him, or he struck him <b>on his tooth and loosened it, if he can use</b> the eye or the tooth <b>now,</b> the <b>slave is not emancipated by means of them. And if</b> he can <b>no</b> longer use them at all, then the <b>slave is emancipated by means of them. It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> clause in that <i>baraita</i>: In a case <b>where</b> the slave’s <b>eye was weak</b> prior to this incident, <b>and</b> the master <b>blinded it</b> entirely, or if the slave’s <b>tooth was loose and</b> his master <b>knocked it out, if he</b> was <b>able to use them before</b> the master struck him, the <b>slave is emancipated by means of them, and if not,</b> then the <b>slave is not emancipated by means of them.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state both <i>halakhot</i>, despite the fact that they apparently teach the same <i>halakha</i> that a weakened eye is not considered a significant injury, <b>as, if</b> the <i>tanna</i> had <b>taught us</b> only <b>this first</b> <i>halakha</i>, I would say that he is emancipated, <b>because at the outset</b> his <b>vision was strong and now</b> his <b>vision is weak. But here,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, <b>where his vision was also weak at the outset,</b> I would <b>say</b> he is <b>not</b> emancipated if the master blinded him entirely, as his eye did not function properly even beforehand.
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if</b> the <i>tanna</i> had <b>taught us</b> only <b>this</b> second <i>halakha</i>, I would say that he is emancipated <b>because he blinded</b> him <b>entirely. But there,</b> where <b>he did not blind</b> him <b>entirely</b> I would <b>say no,</b> he is not emancipated, despite the fact that he weakened his vision. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to state both <i>halakhot</i>.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Kamma</i> 9:9): In a case <b>where his master was a doctor and</b> the slave <b>said to him to paint his eye</b> with a medicament, <b>and</b> the master <b>blinded it</b> in the process, or he asked him <b>to drill his</b> aching <b>tooth, and</b> the master <b>knocked it out,</b> the slave <b>laughs at the master and is emancipated. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says</b> that the verse: “And if a man smites the eye of his slave, or the eye of his maidservant, <b>and destroys it,</b> to freedom shall he send him for his eye’s sake” (Exodus 21:26), means that the slave is not emancipated <b>unless</b> the master <b>intends to destroy it.</b> If he intended to heal him, the slave is not freed, even if the master did, in fact, injure him.
The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis, what do they do with this</b> verse <b>“and destroys it”?</b> What do they derive from this phrase? The Gemara answers: <b>They require</b> it <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that in a case <b>where</b> the master <b>stuck his hand into the womb of his maidservant</b> to assist her in giving birth <b>and he blinded the fetus in her womb, he is exempt</b> and the fetus is not emancipated when born. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>As the verse states “and destroys it,”</b> meaning <b>unless he intends to destroy</b> it, and in this case he did not mean to touch the fetus’s eye.
<b>And the other</b> Sage, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, would say that that <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived from</b> the fact that the verse could have said: <b>And destroys,</b> and instead said <b>“destroys it.” And the other</b> Sage, i.e., the Rabbis, how do they respond to this argument? <b>They do not expound</b> the difference between <b>“destroys”</b> and <b>“destroys it,”</b> i.e., they maintain that this is not a significant deviation from which one can derive a <i>halakha</i>.
<b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> In a case <b>where</b> the slave’s <b>eye was blind and</b> the master <b>removed it</b> entirely, the <b>slave is emancipated by means of</b> this injury. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>He is</b> now <b>lacking a limb,</b> which is worse than a mere blemish.
<b>And the <i>tanna</i></b> of a <i>baraita</i> also <b>taught:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of <b>unblemished status,</b> i.e., that an offering must not contain a blemish, <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>male status</b> apply <b>to animal</b> offerings, <b>but</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>unblemished status and</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>male status</b> do <b>not</b> apply <b>to bird</b> offerings.
The Gemara comments: One <b>might</b> have thought that if one brings a bird <b>whose wing is dried,</b> or whose <b>leg is severed,</b> or whose <b>eye was removed,</b> that it too is acceptable as an offering. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And if his offering to the Lord is a burnt-offering <b>from birds”</b> (Leviticus 1:14). This phrase indicates that only some birds can be sacrificed as offerings, <b>but not all birds.</b> This teaches that a bird can be disqualified due to a blemish. For example, if a significant part of the bird is missing, e.g., a limb, the bird is not acceptable as an offering. This indicates that the actual loss of an eye is considered a greater blemish than blindness. Consequently, if his master takes out the slave’s blind eye, he is emancipated.
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ashi says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If the slave <b>had</b>

Daf 25a

<b>an extra</b> finger, i.e., six fingers on his hand, <b>and</b> the master <b>severed it,</b> the <b>slave is emancipated by means of</b> this injury. <b>Rav Huna says: And this</b> <i>halakha</i> applies <b>when</b> the finger <b>can be counted along the back of the hand,</b> i.e., the extra finger is on the same line as the others. If it protrudes from another spot, then it is not classified as a finger but a mere growth, and destroying it is not considered the removal of a limb.
§ The Gemara relates: <b>The Elders of</b> the city of <b>Nezonya did not come to Rav Ḥisda’s lecture.</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>said to Rav Hamnuna: Go</b> and <b>ostracize them [<i>tzaninhu</i>]</b> because they act disrespectfully toward the Sages. Rav Hamnuna <b>went</b> and <b>said to</b> the Elders of Nezonya: <b>What is the reason that the rabbis did not come to the lecture? They said to him: Why should we come, as we asked him</b> about <b>a matter and he did not resolve it for us.</b> We have nothing to learn from him. Rav Hamnuna <b>said to them: Have you asked me anything that I did not resolve for you?</b> Ask me your question.
<b>They raised</b> the following <b>dilemma before him:</b> With regard to <b>a slave whose master castrates his testicles, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Is that considered an exposed blemish</b> that is sufficient to emancipate him <b>or not?</b> An answer to their dilemma <b>was not available to</b> Rav Hamnuna. <b>They said to him: What is your name? He said to them: Hamnuna. They said to him</b> in jest: You should <b>not</b> be called <b>Hamnuna,</b> a good hot fish; <b>rather,</b> your name should be <b>Karnuna,</b> a cold fish that is no longer tasty.
After this encounter Rav Hamnuna <b>came before Rav Ḥisda</b> and told him what had happened. Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: They raised before you a dilemma</b> that can be resolved from <b>a <i>baraita</i>,</b> which was cited in connection to a mishna, and you did not know how to answer them. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 6:7): There are <b>twenty-four extremities in a person, none of which can become ritually impure due to unaffected skin.</b> The Torah states that if a leprous spot contains some healthy flesh, the person is immediately rendered impure (Leviticus 13:14). The <i>halakha</i> of unaffected skin does not apply to the extremities because the priest must be able to see the entirety of the untainted area at once. Due to the shape of the twenty-four extremities, it is impossible to see the entirety of the area from a single vantage point. Consequently, the <i>halakha</i> of unaffected skin does not apply to them.
<b>And these are</b> the twenty-four extremities: <b>The extremities of the fingers and toes,</b> twenty in total, <b>and the extremities of the ears, and the extremity of the nose, and the extremity of the penis, and the extremities of the nipples of a woman. Rabbi Yehuda says: Even</b> the nipples <b>of a man</b> are included. <b>And it is taught in that regard</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A slave is emancipated for</b> injuries to <b>all of them.</b> The body parts listed with regard to leprosy are the same ones that, when injured, lead to the emancipation of a slave. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Also, the castration</b> of a slave by his master entails his freedom. <b>Ben Azzai says: The tongue</b> is <b>also</b> considered an exposed body part, as it is exposed when one speaks. Consequently, if the master severs his slave’s tongue, the slave goes free.
<b>The Master said</b> above that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Also castration.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Castration of what? If we say</b> that it is referring to <b>castration of</b> the <b>penis,</b> i.e., that the master severed the slave’s penis, <b>this is</b> the same as the mishna that already mentioned <b>a penis.</b> What, then, does Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi add? <b>Rather, is it not</b> correct to say that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi is referring to <b>castration of the testicles?</b> If so, this <i>baraita</i> resolves the dilemma raised by the Elders of Nezonya.
The Gemara further analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Also castration,</b> but he does not include the tongue, unlike ben Azzai. The Gemara inquires: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, is the <b>tongue not</b> considered exposed? <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from the following: In a case <b>where one was sprinkling</b> the purification water of the red heifer on another person in order to purify him from ritual impurity imparted by a corpse, <b>and a sprinkling</b> of water <b>landed on his mouth, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: He has sprinkled,</b> i.e., this is a valid form of sprinkling and the impure person is purified. <b>And the Rabbis say: He has not sprinkled,</b> i.e., this is an invalid form of sprinkling because water of purification must be sprinkled on exposed limbs.
The Gemara clarifies the difficulty from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>What, is it not</b> the case that this is referring to a situation where water was sprinkled <b>on his tongue,</b> which would indicate that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi maintains that the tongue is an exposed limb? The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> this is referring to one who had water sprinkled <b>on his lips.</b> The Gemara asks: If it was sprinkled <b>on his lips, isn’t it obvious</b> that he is ritually pure, as the lips are exposed? The Gemara answers: It is necessary to state this, <b>lest you say</b> that at <b>times, he closes his lips</b> tightly, and consequently they should be considered an unexposed part of the body. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi one’s lips are considered exposed.
The Gemara further asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i> that if one had water sprinkled <b>on his tongue</b> he is ritually pure according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi? <b>And it is further taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> dealing with the blemishes of priests and offerings <b>that</b> if <b>most of his tongue was removed,</b> this is a blemish; and <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> This is referring to a case where the part removed was <b>most of the part of his tongue</b> that <b>he uses for speaking</b> and pronouncing words, which is the tip of the tongue, not most of its length. This indicates that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi maintains that if the tongue is removed, that is considered a blemish.
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> should be explained as follows. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Castration</b> is included, <b>and it is not necessary</b> to say that if the slave’s <b>tongue</b> is removed he is emancipated, as the tongue is exposed. <b>Ben Azzai says:</b> The loss of his <b>tongue</b> emancipates him, <b>but castration</b> does <b>not. And what</b> is the meaning of the term: <b>Also,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, which indicates that ben Azzai is adding to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement? He is adding <b>to the first</b> statement of the first <i>tanna</i>, not to the immediately preceding ruling of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> the statement <b>of ben Azzai should be first,</b> as he adds one item, i.e., the tongue, to the ruling of the first <i>tanna</i>, while Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi further adds the case of castration to ben Azzai’s opinion.
The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> should have been formulated in this manner, but the <b><i>tanna</i></b> first <b>heard</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and set it</b> in his version of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>and</b> afterward <b>he heard</b> the opinion of <b>ben Azzai and taught</b> it at the end. <b>And</b> although it would be appropriate to change the order of the statements, he did not do so because <b>a mishna does not move from its place.</b> Once it has been taught in a certain manner, the <i>tanna</i> will not change the text of a mishna, in order to avoid confusion.
<b>Ulla says: All concede with regard to a tongue</b> that <b>in the matter of ritual impurity it is</b> considered <b>exposed with respect to a dead creeping animal</b> and other items that impart impurity. In other words, if an individual comes into contact with a source of ritual impurity with his tongue, he is rendered impure. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The Merciful One states: “Whom he touches”</b> (Leviticus 15:11), <b>and this</b> tongue <b>can also touch.</b> It is possible for one to touch objects with his tongue.
Similarly, all agree about a tongue with regard <b>to the matter of immersion</b> that the tongue <b>is considered concealed,</b> and therefore one need not open his mouth so that the water touches his tongue. For an immersion to be valid, the water must come into contact with the entire outside of one’s body. Ulla teaches that this does not include the tongue. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The Merciful One states: “And he shall immerse his flesh in water”</b> (Leviticus 15:13). <b>Just as his flesh is on the outside, so too everything</b> that requires immersion is <b>on the outside,</b> and this does not include what is ordinarily on the inside.
<b>They disagreed only</b> with regard <b>to</b> whether the tongue is considered exposed or concealed in <b>the matter of sprinkling. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>compares</b> sprinkling <b>to impurity,</b> where the tongue is considered exposed, <b>and the Rabbis compare it to immersion,</b> where the tongue is considered concealed.
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> the <b>two of them disagree with regard to</b> the meaning of <b>this verse: “And the pure person shall sprinkle upon the impure person</b> on the third day and on the seventh day, and he shall purify him on the seventh day and he shall wash his clothes and immerse in water and he shall become pure in the evening” (Numbers 19:19). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>maintains</b> that the verse should be read as: <b>“And the pure person shall sprinkle upon the impure person on the third day and on the seventh day, and he shall purify him.”</b> This indicates that sprinkling is compared to ritual impurity, which means that it is effective if the water lands on any part of the body that can become impure.
Conversely, <b>the Rabbis maintain</b> that one should read the phrase “and he shall purify him” with the last part of the verse, as follows: <b>“And he shall purify him on the seventh day and he shall wash his clothes and immerse in water.”</b> According to this reading, sprinkling is compared to immersion, which means that the water must be sprinkled on part of the body that requires immersion.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to the opinion of <b>the Rabbis as well, let us compare</b> sprinkling <b>to impurity.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>One should derive purification from purification.</b> Just as immersion is a method of purification, so too sprinkling is a method of purification, and therefore it is appropriate to compare these two cases. The Gemara asks from the other perspective: <b>And</b> with regard to the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>let us compare</b> sprinkling <b>to immersion.</b> The Gemara answers that the phrase <b>“and he shall wash his clothes” concludes</b> the discussion of <b>that matter,</b> i.e., this expression indicates that a new clause begins from here, and therefore sprinkling should not be compared to immersion but to impurity, which is mentioned prior to it.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> does <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>maintain</b> with regard <b>to the matter of immersion</b> that the tongue <b>is considered concealed? But doesn’t Ravin say</b> that <b>Rav Adda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> There was <b>an incident involving a maidservant of the household of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>who immersed</b> herself, <b>and she ascended</b> from her immersion <b>and a bone was found between her teeth, and Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>required her</b> to perform <b>another immersion?</b> This indicates that according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi one may not have a foreign object even inside one’s mouth during immersion. If so, the tongue should require immersion as well.
The Gemara answers: That is no proof, as it is <b>granted that we do not require immersion in water,</b> i.e., the water need not actually enter one’s mouth. But <b>we require</b> that the mouth be <b>a place</b> that is <b>fit for water to enter.</b> If there is a foreign object, the water cannot enter that spot.
This is <b>in accordance with that</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Zeira. As Rabbi Zeira says</b> with regard to meal-offerings: For <b>any</b> amount of flour <b>suitable for mingling</b> with oil in a meal-offering, <b>mingling is not indispensable for it.</b> Although it is a mitzva to mingle the flour and oil <i>ab initio</i>, if they were not mingled the meal-offering is still valid. <b>But</b> for <b>any</b> amount of flour <b>not suitable for mingling, mingling is indispensable for it,</b> and such a meal-offering is invalid. The principle is: <i>Ab initio</i> requirements prevent the fulfillment of a mitzva in situations where they are not merely absent but impossible. Here too, although there is no need for the water to actually enter the concealed spaces of the body, it is still necessary that these places be fit for immersion without the interposition of a foreign object.

Daf 25b

The Gemara comments that the first question with regard to castration of the testicles is <b>like</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> It is stated with regard to animals that cannot be used as offerings due to blemishes: <b>“That whose stones are bruised, or crushed, or torn, or cut</b> you shall not sacrifice to the Lord” (Leviticus 22:24). <b>All</b> of these blemishes <b>are</b> referring <b>to</b> the animal’s <b>testicles;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
The Gemara asks: Could Rabbi Yehuda possibly mean that these blemishes apply only <b>to the testicles and not to the penis?</b> Certainly these should also be considered blemishes if they affect the penis, which is more exposed than the testicles. <b>Rather,</b> this is what the <i>baraita</i> is saying: <b>All of</b> these blemishes apply <b>to the testicles also;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: All of them</b> apply only <b>to the penis. Rabbi Yosei states</b> the following distinction: <b>“Bruised or crushed”</b> applies <b>to the testicles also.</b> Conversely, when there are areas that are <b>“broken or cut” on the penis, yes,</b> these are considered a blemish, but <b>on the testicles, no,</b> they are not a blemish.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A large domesticated animal is acquired by passing,</b> when its current owner transfers it to a buyer by giving him the reins or the bit. <b>And a small</b> domesticated animal is acquired <b>by lifting.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Eliezer. And the Rabbis say: A small domesticated animal can be acquired by pulling</b> also, and there is no need to lift it.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav taught in</b> the town of <b>Kimḥonya: A large domesticated animal is acquired by pulling. Shmuel found Rav’s students</b> and <b>said to them: Did Rav</b> actually <b>say that a large domesticated animal is acquired by pulling? But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that it is acquired <b>by passing? And</b> several times I <b>also</b> heard <b>Rav say</b> that it is acquired <b>by passing.</b> Did <b>he retract that</b> ruling? Rav’s students replied: In fact, Rav retracted that ruling and <b>he states</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that <i>tanna</i>,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And the Rabbis say: Both</b> small and large domesticated animals <b>are acquired by pulling. Rabbi Shimon says: Both</b> are acquired <b>by lifting.</b>
<b>Rav Yosef objects to</b> this: <b>If that is so, by what</b> mode of acqui-sition <b>can an elephant be acquired, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon?</b> It is impossible to lift an elephant. <b>Abaye said to him:</b> It is possible to acquire it <b>by the</b> mode of acquisition of symbolic <b>exchange,</b> a legal act of acquisition formalizing the transfer of ownership of an article. <b>Alternatively,</b> one can acquire an elephant <b>by renting its place</b> temporarily and acquiring the elephant by means of the ground upon which it is standing.
<b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that there is another method: One <b>brings four vessels and places them under</b> the elephant’s <b>feet,</b> and he thereby acquires it like any other item that is inside the buyer’s vessels. The Gemara asks: Can <b>you learn from</b> Rabbi Zeira’s statement that if the <b>buyer’s vessels,</b> being used to acquire an item from the seller, <b>are in the seller’s domain, the buyer acquires</b> the item? The Gemara rejects this: This is no proof, as <b>with what are we dealing here?</b> The case in question is one where the vessels are not in the seller’s domain but <b>in an alley [<i>simta</i>],</b> which is neither a public nor a private domain. In a place of this kind the buyer’s vessels certainly effect acquisition for him.

Daf 26a

<b>Alternatively,</b> the buyer can lift an elephant <b>by</b> using <b>bundles of vines.</b> He leads the elephant to them, and when the elephant stands on the bundles of vines this is considered lifting the elephant.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Property that serves as a guarantee,</b> i.e., land or other items that are fixed in the earth, <b>can be acquired by</b> means of giving <b>money, by</b> means of giving <b>a document, or by</b> means of taking <b>possession</b> of it. Property <b>that does not serve as a guarantee,</b> i.e., movable property, <b>can be acquired only by pulling. Property that does not serve as a guarantee can be acquired</b> along <b>with property that serves as a guarantee by</b> means of giving <b>money, by</b> means of giving <b>a document, or by</b> means of taking <b>possession</b> of them. The movable property is transferred to the buyer’s possession when it is purchased together with the land, by means of an act of acquisition performed on the land.
Generally, one is not obligated to take an oath concerning the denial of a claim with regard to land. The mishna continues: <b>And</b> in a legal dispute involving both land and movable property, if the defendant makes a partial admission of the claim with regard to the movable property, thereby rendering himself obligated to take an oath denying any responsibility for the remaining property, the movable property <b>binds the property that serves as a guarantee,</b> i.e., the land, so that he is forced <b>to take an oath concerning</b> the land as well, despite the fact that one is generally not obligated to take an oath for a claim involving land.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara inquires: <b>From where do we</b> derive that land can be acquired <b>by</b> means of <b>money? Ḥizkiyya said</b> that <b>the verse states: “They shall acquire fields with money”</b> (Jeremiah 32:44). The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the proof is from that verse, one can <b>say</b> that the acquisition is not valid <b>unless there is a document</b> as well, <b>as it is written</b> in the same verse: <b>“And write a document and sign”</b> (Jeremiah 32:44). The Gemara answers: <b>If it were written: They shall acquire</b> fields with money, <b>at the end</b> of the verse, it would be <b>as you said,</b> that one must also write a document so that he can acquire the land with money. <b>Now that it is written “they shall acquire” at the beginning</b> of the verse, this teaches that the <b>money</b> itself <b>effects acquisition</b> of the land, and the <b>document is merely a proof.</b>
<b>Rav says: They taught</b> that land can be acquired by means of money alone, i.e., without a document, <b>only in a place where</b> the custom is that <b>they do not write documents; but in a place where</b> the custom is that <b>they write documents one does not acquire</b> land until a document is given to him. <b>And if he specified</b> that he wishes to acquire the land from the time of the money transfer, then <b>he has specified</b> his wishes, and the land is acquired once the money is given.
The Gemara comments: This is <b>like that which Rav Idi bar Avin</b> would do. <b>When purchasing land,</b> Rav Idi bar Avin <b>would say: If I wish</b> to acquire it <b>by</b> means of <b>money, I will acquire</b> it in that manner, and <b>if I wish</b> to acquire it <b>by</b> means of <b>a document, I will acquire</b> it by that method. He would stipulate at the outset that he reserves the right to choose how the transaction will be finalized. The Gemara elaborates: <b>If I wish</b> to acquire it <b>by</b> means of <b>money, I will acquire</b> it in that way, <b>as, if you wish to retract</b> your participation in the sale <b>you cannot retract</b> it, because the money has already changed hands. <b>And if I wish</b> to acquire the land <b>by</b> means of <b>a document, I will acquire</b> it in that way, <b>as, if I wish to retract</b> my participation in the sale <b>I can retract</b> it provided that I have not received a document of purchase.
§ The mishna teaches that land can be purchased <b>by</b> means of <b>a document.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>because it is written: “And write in a document and sign, and witnesses shall testify”</b> (Jeremiah 32:44), <b>but didn’t you say</b> that the document mentioned in the verse <b>is merely a document of proof? Rather,</b> it is derived <b>from here: “And I took the deed of purchase”</b> (Jeremiah 32:11), an expression that indicates that the document itself effects the acquisition. <b>Shmuel said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that the document itself effects acquisition <b>only</b> in the case <b>of a deed of a gift. But with regard to a sale, it does not effect acquisition until</b> the buyer <b>gives</b> the seller <b>money.</b> The document itself does not effect the acquisition.
<b>Rav Hamnuna raises an objection</b> to this from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How</b> is acquisition performed <b>by</b> means of <b>a document?</b> If he <b>wrote for him on paper or earthenware, even though</b> the paper or the earthenware <b>is not worth one <i>peruta</i>: My field is sold to you,</b> or: <b>My field is given to you</b> as a gift, <b>it is thereby sold or given.</b> This indicates that a document is sufficient to effect acquisition both in the case of a sale and in the case of a gift. Rav Hamnuna <b>raised the objection and he resolved it:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to one <b>who sells his field due to its poor</b> quality. The seller wants to be rid of his field due to its decreasing value and would like to transfer ownership of it as quickly as possible. In this case writing a document is enough to complete the acquisition.
<b>Rav Ashi says:</b> It can be claimed that the entire <i>baraita</i> is referring to one case, that <b>of a gift</b> one <b>wished to give</b> another. The <i>baraita</i> does not deal with a sale at all. <b>And why does he write for him</b> a deed for a gift containing the <b>language of a sale? He does it in order to enhance his power.</b> If it turns out that there was a lien on this land, the beneficiary can collect the value of the field from the giver’s other property, as though this land had been sold to him. In other words, by writing that it is a sale, the giver grants the beneficiary the acquisition power of a buyer, but since the transaction is actually a gift, the document itself completes the acquisition.
§ The mishna further teaches that land can be acquired <b>by</b> means of taking <b>possession</b> of it. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Ḥizkiyya said</b> that <b>the verse states: “And dwell in your cities that you have taken”</b> (Jeremiah 40:10). <b>In what</b> manner <b>have you taken</b> these cities? They are taken <b>by dwelling,</b> which indicates that taking possession of a plot of land and dwelling there is an act demonstrating ownership, and it is itself a valid act of acquisition. A Sage from <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> a different proof: <b>“And you shall possess it and dwell there”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:31). <b>How have you possessed</b> it? You have done so <b>by dwelling</b> there. This teaches that land can be acquired through an act that demonstrates ownership.
§ The mishna teaches that property <b>that does not serve as a guarantee can be acquired only by pulling.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written: “And if you sell any item to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor’s hand”</b> (Leviticus 25:14). This verse speaks of <b>an item that is acquired from hand to hand,</b> i.e., by pulling.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who says</b> that <b>by Torah law</b> giving <b>money effects acquisition</b> but pulling does not, <b>what can be said?</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that acquisition through pulling is a rabbinic decree, and by Torah law movable property can be acquired only by means of giving money. Why does the mishna not mention this mode of acquisition? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoḥanan could answer that the <b><i>tanna</i> teaches a rabbinic ordinance,</b> which reflects the accepted practice, but he does not find it necessary to mention a mode of acquisition that applies by Torah law.
§ The mishna further states that <b>property that does not serve as a guarantee,</b> i.e., movable property, can be acquired along with property that serves as a guarantee, i.e., land. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Ḥizkiyya said</b> that <b>the verse states: “And their father gave them</b> great <b>gifts,</b> of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, <b>with fortified cities in Judah”</b> (II Chronicles 21:3). This indicates that he gave them movable items together with the cities. He did not need to give the items to them directly, as he was able to transfer these gifts by means of the cities he gave them.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages with regard to this matter of acquisition of movable property by way of land: Do <b>we require</b> that this movable property be actually <b>piled</b> on the land that is sold <b>or not? Rav Yosef said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the following mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 3:6). <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The owner of <b>any amount of land is obligated in <i>pe’a</i> and in first fruits,</b>

Daf 26b

<b>and</b> if the debtor possesses land of any area the creditor <b>can write a document that prevents the Sabbatical Year from abrogating an outstanding debt [<i>prosbol</i>] for it</b> so that his loans will not be canceled in the seventh year, <b>and</b> he <b>can acquire property that does not serve as a guarantee</b> along <b>with it. And if you say</b> that <b>we require</b> the movable property to be <b>piled</b> on the land, <b>for what is</b> land <b>of any size fit?</b> What can be piled on a tiny spot of land?
<b>Rav Shmuel bar Bisna interpreted it before Rav Yosef</b> as follows: <b>For example, if one stuck a needle</b> into a tiny patch of land, which he sold by means of the land, the needle is acquired. <b>Rav Yosef said to him: You disgust me [<i>kevastan</i>]. Did the <i>tanna</i> go to all that trouble just to teach us</b> that <b>a needle</b> can be acquired by means of land? <b>Rav Ashi said: Who shall say to us</b> that <b>he did not hang a pearl worth one thousand dinars on</b> the needle? One can acquire an item of high value through land of this size. In any event, the question of whether or not the movable property must be piled onto the land has not been resolved.
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear,</b> as <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> There was <b>an incident involving a certain Madonite</b> [<b><i>Madoni</i>] who was in Jerusalem, as he had a great deal</b> of <b>movable property and wished to give it as a gift.</b> He was ill and did not have time for the recipient to acquire the property by pulling. The Sages <b>said to him:</b> One in this situation <b>has no remedy but to transfer them by means of land. What did he do? He went and acquired a <i>beit sela</i>,</b> apparently meaning land the size of a <i>sela</i> coin, <b>near Jerusalem and said: This northern</b> portion of the <i>beit sela</i> is given <b>to so-and-so, and with it one hundred sheep and one hundred barrels. And</b> the Madonite <b>died, and</b> the Sages <b>fulfilled his statement</b> and gave the gifts.
<b>And if you say</b> that to acquire movable property by way of land <b>we require</b> that the property be actually <b>piled upon it, for what is a <i>beit sela</i> fit?</b> It is impossible to pile one hundred sheep and one hundred barrels on top of such a small plot of land. The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Do you maintain</b> that <b>a <i>beit sela</i></b> is referring to a place that is <b>actually</b> the size of <b>a <i>sela</i></b> coin? No; rather <b>what</b> is the meaning of the term <b><i>sela</i>?</b> It is referring to a place <b>that</b> is <b>very large</b> and that could hold the many gifts. If that is true, <b>why did they call it <i>sela</i>?</b> This name indicates <b>that</b> it was <b>hard as rock [<i>sela</i>].</b>
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a different source, <b>as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> There was <b>an incident involving a certain person who became sick in Jerusalem,</b> and the assumption that he became sick is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who says that a person on his deathbed can transfer property only by means of an accepted standard act of acquisition. <b>And some say he was healthy,</b> and that assumption is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> that a person on his deathbed can transfer property by means of speech alone, whereas a healthy person requires an accepted act of acquisition.
The incident happened as follows: This man <b>had a great deal</b> of <b>movable property and he wished to give it</b> away <b>as a gift.</b> The Sages <b>said to him:</b> In this situation one <b>has no remedy but to transfer</b> movable property <b>by means of land. What did he do? He went and acquired</b> land the size of <b>a <i>beit rova</i> near Jerusalem and said: This square handbreadth</b> is given <b>to so-and-so, and with it one hundred sheep and one hundred barrels. And he died, and the Sages fulfilled his statement. And if you say</b> that <b>we require</b> that the property be <b>piled</b> on the land, <b>for what is a square handbreadth fit?</b> Is it possible to place all of these items in such a limited space?
The Gemara rejects this: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> It is <b>with money,</b> i.e., he sought to give the value of the barrels and sheep, and money of this amount can be placed on a small plot of land. The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> that this incident involved money. <b>As, if it enters your mind</b> to say that it involved <b>an actual</b> group of <b>one hundred sheep and one hundred barrels, let him transfer them to</b> the recipient <b>through</b> an act of symbolic <b>exchange.</b> If the incident involved money, which cannot be transferred by symbolic exchange, he had no recourse but to acquire the land.
The Gemara raises a difficulty against this argument: <b>Rather, what</b> will you say, that this is referring <b>to money,</b> which cannot be acquired through symbolic exchange? Even so, he still could have acted differently: <b>Let him transfer it</b> to the recipient <b>through pulling. Rather,</b> you are forced to say <b>that the recipient of this gift was not</b> present, and the man wanted to grant him possession of it without the recipient having to perform a physical act of acquisition. <b>So too,</b> it is possible <b>that the recipient of the gift was not</b> present, and he was unable to transfer it to him through symbolic exchange. Consequently, there is no proof that the incident involved money.
The Gemara asks: Is there no other way to perform this acquisition? <b>But let him transfer it to him by means of another</b> person, i.e., another can pull the property on behalf of the recipient. The Gemara answers: The giver <b>did not rely</b> on that option, as he <b>feared</b> that the third party might <b>seize it and consume it</b> or use the property in some other manner. The giver wanted to be sure that the acquisition would be completed in full.
<b>Rather, what</b> then is the meaning of the statement: <b>He has no remedy?</b> Even if he did not want to use the option of a third party, it was certainly available to him. The Gemara explains that <b>this is what</b> Rav was <b>saying</b> and meant in his description of this incident: In accordance <b>with</b> his decision <b>that he does not rely</b> on another person and does not want to transfer property by means of anyone else, in this situation one <b>has no remedy but to transfer</b> movable property <b>by means of land.</b> In summary, no decisive proof has been cited as to whether or not it is possible to acquire movable property by means of land when the items are not piled upon the land.
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the following mishna (<i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 5:9): There was <b>an incident involving Rabban Gamliel and</b> other <b>Elders who were traveling on a ship. Rabban Gamliel said to the Elders: One-tenth</b> of produce <b>that I will measure out</b> and separate <b>in the future</b> from the produce of my fields

Daf 27a

<b>is given</b> as first tithe <b>to Yehoshua</b> ben Ḥananya, who was a Levite, <b>and the place</b> of the tithe <b>is rented to him</b> so that he can acquire the tithe by means of the land. <b>And another tenth that I will measure out in the future</b> as the poor man’s tithe <b>is given to Akiva ben Yosef so that he will acquire it on behalf of the poor, and its place is rented to him.</b> One can <b>learn from here</b> that <b>we require</b> the movable property to be <b>piled on</b> the land, as Rabban Gamliel emphasized: Its place. The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>It is different there,</b> as Rabban Gamliel did this <b>so as not to trouble</b> the Sages to whom he was giving the tithes by forcing them to transport the tithes to a different location. For reasons of convenience he transferred to the other Sages ownership of the land where the tithes were already situated.
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution for this dilemma, <b>as Rava bar Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rav says: There are two</b> types of <b>documents.</b> If one says: <b>Acquire this field for so-and-so and write the document for him</b> as proof of the sale of the field, <b>he can retract</b> his agreement <b>with regard to the document.</b> He can change his mind and tell them not to write the document. <b>But he cannot retract</b> his agreement <b>with regard to the field,</b> as the buyer has already acquired it. By contrast, if he said: Acquire this field for so-and-so <b>on the condition that you write him a document,</b> if the document has not yet been given <b>he can retract</b> his agreement <b>both with regard to the document and with regard to the field,</b> as he transfers the field to him only on the condition that he writes a document.
<b>And Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin said</b> that <b>Rav Huna</b> said: <b>There are</b> actually <b>three</b> types of <b>documents. Two</b> types are <b>those that we said,</b> and <b>the other</b> type is as follows. <b>If the seller first wrote him the document,</b> as a seller can write a bill of sale before the transaction and give it when he receives payment. This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 167b): A scribe may <b>write a deed</b> of sale <b>for the seller</b> of property who requests one, <b>even if the purchaser is not with him</b> when he presents his request. In a case of this kind, <b>once</b> the buyer <b>takes possession of the land from him, the document is acquired</b> by the buyer <b>wherever it is,</b> i.e., even if it is not in the possession of the buyer.
One can <b>learn from</b> here that <b>we do not require</b> that the property be <b>piled on it,</b> as in this case the document is acquired by means of the land wherever the document is located. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>A document is different, as it is the bridle of the land.</b> Since the document that refers to the land is the means by which one takes possession of the land, it is considered as though the document is part of the land. Therefore, one can take possession of the document by means of the land without it actually having to be placed there. The same does not necessarily apply to other movable property, which does not refer specifically to the land.
The Gemara asks: <b>But it was taught concerning this</b> <i>halakha</i> that a document can effect acquisition wherever it is located: <b>This is what we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>Property that does not serve as a guarantee can be acquired</b> along <b>with property that serves as a guarantee by</b> means of giving <b>money, by</b> means of giving <b>a document, or by</b> means of taking <b>possession</b> of them. This indicates that there is no difference between a document and other types of movable property. Consequently, one can <b>learn from</b> here that <b>we do not require</b> that the property be <b>piled on</b> the land. The Gemara affirms: One can <b>learn from</b> here that this is the case.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Do we require</b> that one who sells movable property <b>by means of</b> land state explicitly that this is his intention, <b>or not?</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as</b> those aforementioned <i>baraitot</i> <b>teach all these</b> <i>halakhot</i> of acquiring movable property through land, <b>and</b> they <b>do not teach</b> the expression: <b>By means of.</b> This indicates that it is not necessary to specify this aspect of the acquisition. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>And according to your reasoning, is it taught</b> that he must say to him: <b>Acquire</b> it? The <i>baraitot</i> do not state this, and yet everyone agrees that the seller must say to him that he should acquire the land.
<b>Rather,</b> one must say that the acquisition is not effective <b>unless he says: Acquire</b> it, and yet the <i>tanna</i> did not deem it necessary to mention this requirement. <b>Here too,</b> the acquisition is not effective <b>unless he says: By means of.</b> This requirement is not mentioned because these <i>baraitot</i> do not discuss the type of statements he must issue, but simply are referring to the basic legal issues involved. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>we do not require</b> that the property be <b>piled</b> on the land, but <b>we require</b> that the seller say that he is transferring the movable property <b>by means of</b> the land, <b>and</b> he must say: <b>Acquire</b> it.
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If a seller wishes to give <b>a field in</b> the form of <b>a sale and</b> with it <b>movable property as a gift, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Can he transfer them together by means of a transaction performed with the land? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof for this dilemma from the incident involving Rabban Gamliel, as he said: <b>One-tenth</b> of produce <b>that I will measure out in the future is given to Yehoshua, and its place is rented to him. Learn from this</b> that even if the field is rented, which is equivalent to a sale, and the tithe is given as a gift, one can transfer the two together.
Another <b>dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If one wishes to give <b>a field to one</b> person <b>and movable property to another, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Can one transfer movable property to one person by means of land that is going to be gifted to another? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which Rabban Gamliel stated: <b>One-tenth</b> of <b>that</b> which <b>I will measure out in the future is given to Akiva ben Yosef so that he will acquire it on behalf of the poor, and its place is rented to him.</b> Although the gift is for the poor and the place is rented to Rabbi Akiva, the acquisition is effective.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>Rented,</b> in this case? It means <b>rented for tithe.</b> This land was not rented to Rabbi Akiva for his own use, but only so that he could receive the tithe. Therefore, the land was also given to the poor. <b>And if you wish, say</b> a different refutation: <b>Rabbi Akiva is different,</b> as he was a charity collector, and therefore <b>he was</b> considered <b>like the hand of the poor.</b> Since a charity collector collects charity on behalf of the poor, he has the status of the poor himself. If so, this cannot be compared to a case in which one transfers a certain item to one person and land to someone else.
§ <b>Rava says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that one can acquire movable property by way of land <b>only when he gives all the money</b> for the land and the movable property. <b>But</b> if <b>he did not give the money</b> for <b>all</b> the property, even if they were transferred to him <b>he acquires only</b> the movable property <b>corresponding to the money</b> that he paid.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ketubot</i> 2:3) <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava: The power of money is greater than the power of a document</b> in one way, <b>and the power of a document</b> is greater <b>than the power of money</b> in a different way. The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: <b>The power of money is greater</b> in <b>that money</b> can be used to <b>redeem consecrated property and second tithe, which is not</b> the case <b>with a document. And the power of a document is greater</b> than the power of money, <b>as a document releases a Jewish woman,</b> i.e., a man can divorce his wife with a bill of divorce, <b>which is not</b> the case <b>with money.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>the power of each,</b> money and a document, as a means to transfer ownership <b>is greater than</b> the power of acquisition by means of <b>taking possession, and the power of taking possession is greater than</b> the power of acquisition of <b>each of them.</b> How so? The <b>power of each of them is greater</b> than the power of acquisition of taking possession, <b>as each of them effects acquisition</b> in the case <b>of a Hebrew slave, which is not</b> the case <b>for taking possession</b> (see 14b). <b>The power of taking possession is greater</b> than the power of acquisition of each of them, <b>as</b> with regard to <b>taking possession,</b> if one <b>sold</b> another <b>ten fields in ten countries, once</b> the buyer <b>takes possession one of</b> the fields <b>he acquires all of them.</b>

Daf 27b

<b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said in a case <b>when he gave him money for all</b> of the land. <b>But</b> if <b>he did not give him money for all of it, he acquires only</b> the land <b>corresponding to</b> the <b>money</b> that <b>he</b> paid, in accordance with the opinion of Rava. The Gemara comments: The <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, as Shmuel says:</b> If <b>one sold</b> another <b>ten fields in ten countries, once he takes possession of one of them he acquires all of them.</b>
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: Know</b> that this is true, <b>as, if he handed him ten animals with one bridle [<i>afsar</i>] and said to him: Acquire</b> them, <b>doesn’t he acquire</b> all of them? In this case, too, they are considered like one field. A Sage <b>said to</b> Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika: <b>Is it comparable? There, its bond,</b> i.e., the bridle that joins the animals, <b>is in his hand. Here,</b> in the case of ten fields, <b>its bond is not in his hand.</b>
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: Know that he does not acquire</b> all of the fields by taking possession of only one field, as, <b>if one passed to him ten animals with one bridle and said to him: Acquire this one, does he acquire</b> all of them? The same applies here when he takes possession of only one field; it is as though he said to him: Acquire this one, and therefore he does not acquire the other fields in this manner.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Is it comparable? There,</b> the animals are <b>separate entities,</b> and therefore when he says to him: Acquire this one, there is no reason that the other animals should be acquired as well. <b>Here, the mass of the earth is one.</b> Consequently, if he acquires one plot of land, he acquires the other plots along with it.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> in a legal dispute involving both land and movable property, if the defendant makes a partial admission of the claim with regard to the movable property, thereby rendering himself obligated to take an oath denying any responsibility for the remaining property, the movable property <b>binds the property</b> that serves as a guarantee, i.e., the land, so that he is forced to take an oath concerning the land as well, despite the fact that one is generally not obligated to take an oath for a claim involving land. <b>Ulla says: From where</b> is it derived <b>from the Torah that</b> one can impose <b>the extension of an oath,</b> i.e., if one is required to take an oath for one claim, the other party can obligate him to take an oath with regard to other claims which on their own would not lead to the imposition of an oath?
<b>As it is stated</b> with regard to a <i>sota</i>: <b>“And the woman shall say: Amen, amen”</b> (Numbers 5:22), <b>and we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sota</i> 18a): <b>Concerning what does she say</b> the double expression of: <b>Amen, amen?</b> She says <b>amen on the curse,</b> as she accepts the curse upon herself if she is guilty, and <b>amen on the oath,</b> as she declares that she is not defiled. She states: <b>Amen</b> if I committed adultery <b>with this man</b> about whom I was warned, <b>amen</b> if I committed adultery <b>with another man. Amen that I did not stray</b> when I was <b>betrothed nor</b> after I was <b>married, nor as a widow waiting for my <i>yavam</i></b> to perform levirate marriage, since a woman at that stage is prohibited from engaging in sexual intercourse with any men, <b>nor</b> when <b>married</b> through levirate marriage to the <i>yavam</i>.
The Gemara analyzes this <i>halakha</i>: <b>What are the circumstances</b> with regard to <b>this betrothed woman? If we say that he warned her</b> not to seclude herself with a particular man <b>when she was betrothed, and he gives her</b> the bitter water of a <i>sota</i> <b>to drink when she is betrothed, but didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Sota</i> 23b): With regard to <b>a betrothed woman</b> who secluded herself with another man after being warned by her betrothed, <b>and a widow waiting for her <i>yavam</i></b> to perform levirate marriage who secluded herself with another man after being warned by her <i>yavam</i>, <b>they neither drink</b> the bitter water <b>nor collect</b> payment of their <b>marriage contracts. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The Merciful One states</b> as part of her oath: “But if you have gone aside, being <b>under your husband”</b> (Numbers 5:20), <b>and</b> that does <b>not</b> apply here, as these women are not yet under their husband’s authority.
<b>Rather,</b> one must say <b>that he warned her when she was betrothed,</b> i.e., he warned her when she was betrothed not to seclude herself with a particular man, <b>and she secluded herself</b> with that man <b>when she was betrothed, and he gave her</b> the water <b>to drink when she was married.</b>
The Gemara asks: But in this case, <b>does the water</b> she is given to drink <b>examine her</b> and cause her death? Doesn’t <b>the Merciful One state: “And the man shall be clear from iniquity”</b> (Numbers 5:31)? This verse indicates: <b>When the man is clear from iniquity, the water examines his wife;</b> but if <b>the man is not clear from iniquity</b> with regard to the matter of illicit sexual intercourse, <b>the water does not examine his wife.</b> Since he suspected her of impropriety when she was betrothed and warned her about a particular man, and she secluded herself with that man regardless of his warning, he was not allowed to engage in intercourse with her. If he did so, he is a sinner himself, and therefore the water will not affect his wife. If so, it is impossible for a betrothed woman to be examined as a <i>sota</i>.
<b>Rather,</b> it is clear that this oath is administered <b>by means of an extension.</b> Although the husband cannot force her to take an oath only with regard to her behavior before they were married, since she must take an oath with regard to her behavior during her marriage, he can extend the oath to include incidents that occurred while she was betrothed.
The Gemara comments: <b>We found</b> a source for the extension of an oath in the case of <b>a <i>sota</i>, which</b> is a <i>halakha</i> involving <b>a prohibition. From where do we</b> derive that an oath can be extended with regard to <b>monetary</b> matters as well? <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> that this can be derived through an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And just as</b> in the case of <b>a <i>sota</i>,</b>

Daf 28a

<b>where</b> an oath <b>cannot be imposed by one witness,</b> as two witnesses must testify that the wife secluded herself with the man concerning whom she was warned in order for her to be obligated to take the oath of a <i>sota</i>, and yet <b>one can extend</b> her oath, <b>is it not logical</b> that with regard to a claim involving <b>money, where</b> an oath <b>can be imposed by</b> the testimony of <b>one witness,</b> that <b>one can extend</b> the oath?
The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for the extension of an oath <b>in</b> the case of <b>a definite</b> claim, i.e., when the plaintiff is certain of his claim. <b>From where do we</b> derive that this <i>halakha</i> of the extension of an oath applies also to <b>uncertain</b> claims, when the plaintiff is not sure the defendant owes him money but merely suspects this to be the case?
The Gemara answers: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: The Torah states an external oath,</b> i.e., an oath administered outside of the Temple, <b>and it states an internal oath,</b> an oath administered inside the Temple courtyard, i.e., the oath of a <i>sota</i>. <b>Just as with regard to an oath stated</b> in the Torah that is taken <b>inside</b> the Temple, the Torah <b>rendered uncertainty like certainty,</b> as in the case of a <i>sota</i> the husband’s claim is based on suspicion and yet he can extend that oath; <b>so too, with regard to an oath stated</b> in the Torah that is taken <b>outside</b> the Temple, the Torah <b>rendered uncertainty</b> to be <b>like certainty,</b> i.e., all oaths can be extended to include even uncertain claims.
§ The Gemara asks: <b>Until where</b> does the <b>extension of an oath</b> reach? It has been established that a plaintiff can attach other claims to the oath that the defendant is required to take, even if they do not relate to the current claim submitted in court. To what extent can the plaintiff impose additional oaths? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is <b>that</b> a plaintiff <b>can</b> even <b>say to</b> a defendant: <b>Take an oath to me that you are not my</b> Canaanite <b>slave.</b> If the defendant is required to take an oath, e.g., concerning denial of a debt, he can be forced to take an oath about this matter as well.
The Gemara asks: But the court <b>ostracizes one</b> who says this to another, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who calls another a slave shall be ostracized.</b> One who calls another <b>a <i>mamzer</i> incurs the</b> punishment of <b>forty</b> lashes. If one calls another <b>a wicked person</b> then the insulted person may <b>harass him</b> in all aspects of <b>his life.</b> In light of this <i>halakha</i>, it is clear that the court will not force the accused to respond to this insult by taking an oath.
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that the plaintiff can extend an oath by stating: <b>Take an oath to me that you were not sold to me as a Hebrew slave.</b> In this case the plaintiff is not questioning the man’s lineage, as he is simply claiming that he was sold to him as a slave and must work for him. The Gemara asks: But there is nothing novel about this <i>halakha</i>, as this <b>is a proper claim</b> that <b>there is money</b> owed <b>to him</b> by the accused. The sale and service of a Hebrew slave can be assessed in monetary terms, and is analogous to all claims of debt, which can be imposed by extension of an oath. The Gemara answers: <b>Rava</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as Rava says: The Hebrew slave himself is acquired</b> by his master. Consequently, this claim involves not just money but ownership over his person as well.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, this is</b> similar to a claim concerning ownership of <b>land,</b> and the mishna already taught that an oath can be extended to include a claim concerning land. The Gemara answers: This ruling is necessary <b>lest you say: It is land that people are likely to sell privately,</b> and <b>if it is so that</b> the plaintiff had <b>sold</b> it to him, the sale would <b>not</b> have generated <b>publicity,</b> and the public would not know about it. Therefore, the plaintiff’s claim that the defendant sold land to him is reasonable.
By contrast, in <b>this</b> case, where the plaintiff claims that he purchased the defendant as a Hebrew slave, <b>if it is so that he purchased</b> him as a slave, the sale would have generated <b>publicity.</b> Since this supposed sale is not common knowledge, one might have thought that the defendant cannot be forced to take an oath to deny this claim. Therefore, Rava <b>teaches us</b> that despite the absence of public knowledge, one can extend an oath to this claim as well.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna discusses a transaction involving the barter of two items. With regard to <b>all</b> items <b>used as monetary</b> value <b>for another</b> item, i.e., instead of a buyer paying money to the seller, they exchange items of value with each other, <b>once one</b> party in the transaction <b>acquires</b> the item he is receiving, <b>this</b> party <b>is obligated</b> with regard to the item being <b>exchanged for it.</b> Therefore, if it is destroyed or lost, he incurs the loss. <b>How so?</b> If <b>one exchanges an ox for a cow, or a donkey for an ox, once this</b> party <b>acquires</b> the animal that he is receiving, this party <b>is obligated</b> with regard to the item being <b>exchanged for it.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the item given in <b>exchange</b> mentioned in the mishna? If it is referring to <b>a coin,</b> for which property is usually exchanged, can one <b>learn from</b> the mishna that <b>a coin can effect exchange,</b> i.e., it is possible to perform the act of acquisition of exchange, either a standard exchange or a symbolic exchange, using coins? This is problematic, as the <i>halakha</i> is that coins cannot be used for this act of acquisition. <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> The phrase: All items used as monetary value for another item, is not referring to a coin. Rather, <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying:</b> With regard to <b>all</b> items <b>that</b> can be <b>appraised</b> when used <b>as monetary</b> value <b>for another</b> item, i.e., that their value can be appraised relative to the value of another item, excluding a coin, whose value is apparent,

Daf 28b

<b>once one</b> party in the transaction <b>acquires</b> the item he is receiving, <b>this</b> party <b>is obligated</b> with regard to the item being <b>exchanged for it.</b> The novelty of the mishna is that all items, not only vessels, can be used to perform the act of acquisition of exchange. Therefore, one should not infer that the same is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to coins. The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as it teaches</b> afterward: <b>How so?</b> If <b>one exchanges an ox for a cow, or a donkey for an ox,</b> once this party acquires the animal that he is receiving, this party is obligated with regard to the item being exchanged for it. This clause apparently explains the previous clause, and employs the example of animals, not coins. The Gemara summarizes: <b>Learn from</b> this clause that the mishna is referring to acquisition through the exchange of items, not money.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard <b>to what entered our minds initially, that a coin effects</b> symbolic <b>exchange, what</b> is the meaning of the clause: <b>How so,</b> if one exchanged an ox for a cow, once this party acquires the animal that he is receiving, this party is obligated with regard to the item being exchanged for it. This example does not involve a coin. The Gemara explains that it was assumed that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying:</b> Not only can a coin be used in for the act of acquisition of exchange, but <b>produce can also effect exchange. How so?</b> If <b>one exchanged meat of an ox for a cow, or</b> the <b>meat of a donkey for an ox, once this</b> party <b>acquires</b> the item that he is receiving, this party <b>is obligated</b> with regard to the item being <b>exchanged</b> for it.
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Sheshet, who says: Produce effects exchange,</b> i.e., the mode of acquisition of exchange applies not only to vessels but also to produce and animals. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman, who says: Produce does not effect exchange, what can be said?</b>
The Gemara answers: According to this opinion, the mishna is dealing with money alone, and <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying: There is</b> a transaction involving <b>money that is like an exchange. How so?</b> If <b>one exchanged the monetary</b> value <b>of an ox for a cow, or the monetary</b> value <b>of a donkey for an ox,</b> the transaction is effective. In this case, one sold his ox to another for an agreed sum of money, and after the buyer acquired the ox by pulling it, he then offered to give the seller his cow in exchange for the money that he owes him. In this case the cow is acquired without the seller having to pull it. Although this acquisition initially was to be an exchange, it is ultimately a purchase for money, as the second animal is acquired as a result of the forgiving of the monetary debt.
<b>What is the reason</b> for this ruling in light of the <i>halakha</i> that one cannot acquire movable property by means of money alone? The Gemara explains that Rav Naḥman <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said: By Torah law money effects acquisition,</b> i.e., when one pays money he acquires the item, even if he has not yet performed another act of acquisition. <b>And what is</b> the <b>reason</b> that the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>pulling acquires</b> an item and money does not? This is a rabbinic <b>decree lest</b> the seller <b>say to</b> the buyer after receiving the money: <b>Your wheat was burned in the loft.</b> If a fire breaks out or some other mishap occurs after a seller receives the money, he will not bother to save the goods in his house because they no longer belong to him, and the buyer may incur a loss.
The Sages therefore decreed that acquisition takes effect only when a buyer pulls the item. The reason that the mishna allows a transaction that indicates that one can effect acquisition using only money is because that case of the mishna as explained by Rav Naḥman is an uncommon occurrence. It is rare for one who has sold his animal in exchange for money to change his mind and request an animal from the purchaser instead. With regard to <b>a common occurrence, the Sages issued a decree,</b> whereas in the case of <b>an uncommon occurrence, the Sages did not issue a decree.</b> Consequently, the Sages did not apply their decree to this situation.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how is the mishna explained <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish, who</b> disagrees with Rabbi Yoḥanan and <b>says</b> that <b>pulling</b> is <b>explicitly</b> stated <b>in the Torah?</b> Reish Lakish maintains that the acquisition of movable property cannot be performed with money by Torah law, and therefore there can be no distinction between common and uncommon cases. <b>This works out well if</b> Reish Lakish <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Sheshet, who says</b> that <b>produce effects exchange.</b> If so, he can <b>explain</b> the mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Sheshet.</b>
<b>But if he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman, who says</b> that <b>produce does not effect exchange and a coin does not effect acquisition</b> by Torah law or by rabbinic law, <b>in what</b> manner <b>does he establish</b> the mishna? The Gemara answers: <b>Perforce</b> Reish Lakish <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Sheshet.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The authority of the Temple</b> treasury effects acquisition <b>by</b> means of <b>money</b> to the seller. <b>And the authority,</b> i.e., the mode of acquisition, <b>of a commoner</b> [<b><i>hedyot</i></b>] <b>is by possession.</b> Furthermore, <b>one’s declaration to the Most High,</b> i.e., when one consecrates an item through speech, <b>is equivalent to transferring</b> an item <b>to a common person,</b> and the item is acquired by the Temple treasury through his mere speech.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:6): <b>How does the authority of the Temple</b> treasury effect acquisition <b>by</b> means of <b>money?</b> With regard to the Temple <b>treasurer who gives coins for an animal, even</b> if the <b>animal is at the</b> other <b>end of the world, he acquires it</b> immediately. <b>And with regard to a commoner, he does not acquire</b> the animal <b>until he pulls</b> it.
<b>How is one’s declaration to the Most High equivalent to transferring</b> an item <b>to a common person?</b> With regard to <b>one who says: This ox is a burnt-offering,</b> or: <b>This house is consecrated</b> property, the Temple treasury <b>acquires</b> these <b>even</b> if they are <b>at the</b> other <b>end of the world.</b> There is no need for a further act of acquisition, as that statement alone is sufficient. Whereas <b>with regard to a commoner, he does not acquire</b> property in this manner

Daf 29a

<b>until he pulls or takes possession</b> of it. Additionally, the Temple treasury has the following advantage: If a commoner <b>pulled</b> a consecrated item for the purpose of acquiring it <b>with one hundred dinars, and he did not manage to redeem it</b> by paying the one hundred dinars to the Temple treasurer <b>before</b> the item’s price <b>stood at two hundred</b> dinars, he <b>gives two hundred</b> dinars. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It states: <b>He will give the money and it will be assured to him</b> (see Leviticus 27:19). This indicates that one can acquire an item from the Temple treasury only by the actual transfer of money.
By contrast, in the reverse case, when the commoner <b>pulled</b> an item when it was worth <b>two hundred</b> dinars, <b>and he did not manage to redeem it before</b> the value of the item <b>stood at one hundred dinars,</b> he <b>gives two hundred</b> dinars. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The power of a commoner should not be greater than</b> that of the Temple treasury of <b>consecrated</b> property. Since a commoner completes his acquisition by pulling, the item is acquired by him at that price, and the Temple treasury should not suffer a loss in a case where the commoner could not have reneged on his commitment had he been dealing with another commoner.
Similarly, if the commoner <b>redeemed it</b> at <b>two hundred</b> dinars, <b>but he did not manage to pull it before</b> its value <b>stood at one hundred dinars, he gives two hundred</b> dinars. <b>What is the reason?</b> It states: <b>He will give the money and it will be assured to him,</b> which indicates that the redemption of consecrated property is effected with money. By contrast, if <b>he redeemed it at one hundred dinars and did not manage to pull it before it stood at two hundred</b> dinars, <b>what he redeemed is redeemed, and he gives only one hundred dinars.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is this the <i>halakha</i>? <b>So too, let us say: The power of a commoner should not be greater than</b> that of the Temple treasury of <b>consecrated</b> property, and if this occurred in a case where he was dealing with another commoner he would need to pay the full two hundred dinars, which was the value of the item when he pulled it. Shouldn’t the Temple treasury have as much power as a common person?
The Gemara answers: There is an additional impediment to reneging on an agreement with another commoner. <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>a commoner</b> who gave a seller money and changed his mind before acquiring the item is <b>not</b> forced to accept upon himself the curse <b>of: He Who exacted payment</b> from the generation of the flood (see Genesis, chapter 7) and the generation of the dispersion (see Genesis, chapter 11) will punish one who does not keep his word? Although a commoner can legally renege on his agreement at this stage, the Sages disapproved of such dishonest conduct, and one who did so would be cursed in this manner. Consequently, the power of a commoner is not greater than that of the Temple treasury, as it is not a simple matter to renege on an agreement with another commoner.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>all mitzvot of a son with regard to</b> his <b>father, men are obligated</b> to perform them <b>and women are exempt. And</b> with regard to <b>all mitzvot of a father with regard to his son, both men and women are obligated</b> to perform them. The mishna notes an additional difference between the obligations of men and women in the performance of mitzvot: With regard to <b>all positive, time-bound mitzvot,</b> i.e., those which must be performed at specific times, <b>men are obligated</b> to perform them <b>and women are exempt. And</b> with regard to <b>all positive mitzvot that are not time bound, both men and women are obligated</b> to perform them.
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>all prohibitions, whether</b> they are <b>time-bound</b> or <b>whether</b> they are <b>not time-bound, both men and women are obligated</b> to observe them, <b>except for</b> the prohibitions of: <b>Do not round</b> the corners of your head, <b>and: Do not destroy</b> the corners of your beard, which are derived from the verse: “You shall not round the corners of your head and you shall not destroy the corners of your beard” (Leviticus 19:27), <b>and</b> a prohibition that concerns only priests: <b>Do not contract ritual impurity from a corpse</b> (see Leviticus 21:1). These mitzvot apply only to men, not women, despite the fact that they are prohibitions.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>All mitzvot of a son with regard to</b> his <b>father? If we say</b> that it is referring to <b>all mitzvot that the son is obligated to perform with regard to</b> his <b>father,</b> are <b>women exempt</b> from obligations of this kind? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning a verse that deals with the mitzva of honoring one’s father and mother: <b>“A man</b> shall fear [<i>tira’u</i>] his mother and his father” (Leviticus 19:3)? <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a man</b> is obligated in this mitzva. <b>From where</b> do I derive that <b>a woman</b> is also obligated? <b>When it says</b> in the same verse: <b>“A man shall fear [<i>tira’u</i>] his mother and his father”</b> (Leviticus 19:3), employing the plural form of the verb, this indicates that <b>there are two</b> that are obligated <b>here,</b> both a man and a woman.
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying:</b> With regard to <b>all mitzvot of a son that are incumbent upon</b> his <b>father to perform for his son, men are obligated</b> in them <b>and women are exempt.</b>
The Gemara comments: According to this interpretation, <b>we learn</b> in this mishna <b>that which the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A father is obligated with regard to his son to circumcise him, and to redeem him</b> if he is a firstborn son who must be redeemed by payment to a priest, <b>and to teach him Torah, and to marry him to a woman, and to teach him a trade. And some say:</b> A father is <b>also</b> obligated <b>to teach</b> his son <b>to swim. Rabbi Yehuda says: Any</b> father <b>who does not teach his son a trade teaches him banditry [<i>listut</i>].</b> The Gemara expresses surprise at this statement: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that he actually teaches him <b>banditry? Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means that it is <b>as though he teaches him banditry.</b> Since the son has no profession with which to support himself, he is likely to turn to theft for a livelihood. This <i>baraita</i> accords with Rav Yehuda’s interpretation of the mishna.
§ The <i>baraita</i> teaches that a father is obligated <b>to circumcise</b> his son. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? The Gemara answers that this is <b>as it is written: “And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac”</b> (Genesis 21:4). The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> in a case <b>where one’s father did not circumcise him the court is obligated to circumcise him,</b> i.e., if this obligation is not fulfilled by the father it applies to the community as a whole, <b>as it is written: “Every male among you shall be circumcised”</b> (Genesis 17:10), in the form of a general mitzva that does not apply only to the father. <b>And</b> in a case <b>where the court did not circumcise him</b> the son <b>is obligated to circumcise himself</b> when he reaches adulthood, <b>as it is written: “And the uncircumcised male, who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin,</b> that soul <b>shall be cut off</b> from his people” (Genesis 17:14).
<b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> his mother <b>is not obligated</b> to circumcise her son? <b>As it is written:</b> “And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, <b>as God commanded him”</b> (Genesis 21:4). The verse emphasizes that God commanded <b>him, and not her.</b>
<b>We found</b> a source for this mitzva <b>immediately,</b> i.e., when it was given to Abraham; <b>from where do we</b> derive that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>for</b> the men of all <b>generations? The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> that <b>any place where it is stated: “Command,” it is nothing other</b> than an expression of <b>galvanization</b> both <b>immediately and for generations.</b> The mitzva of circumcision is presented by means of this term.
The Gemara elaborates: From where is it derived that the term “command” indicates <b>a galvanization? As it is written: “And command Joshua, and encourage him and strengthen him”</b> (Deuteronomy 3:28). In this context, the term “command” is not referring to a specific command but is a general expression of galvanization. From where is it derived that this applies <b>immediately and for generations? As it is written: “From the day that the Lord commanded and onward throughout your generations”</b> (Numbers 15:23). This shows that whenever the word “command” is used it is referring to that day onward for all generations.
§ The <i>baraita</i> teaches that a father is obligated <b>to redeem</b> his son. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? The Gemara answers that this is <b>as it is written: “All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem”</b> (Exodus 34:20). <b>And</b> in a case <b>where</b> one’s <b>father does not redeem him he is obligated to redeem</b> himself, <b>as it is written: “You shall redeem [<i>pado tifde</i>]”</b> (Numbers 18:15). The repetition of the verb indicates that a firstborn is required to be redeemed in any case, even if his father neglects to do so.
<b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> a mother <b>is not commanded</b> to redeem her son? <b>As it is written: “You shall redeem [<i>tifde</i>]”</b> which can be read as: <b>You shall be redeemed [<i>tippadeh</i>].</b> This indicates that <b>whoever is commanded to redeem himself is commanded to redeem others, and whoever is not commanded to redeem himself is not commanded to redeem others.</b> Since a woman is not commanded to redeem herself, she is not commanded to redeem her son either.
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that she is not obligated to redeem herself?</b> The Gemara answers that this is <b>as it is written: “You shall redeem [<i>tifde</i>],”</b> which can be read as: <b>You shall be redeemed [<i>tippadeh</i>].</b> This indicates that <b>any</b> person <b>whom others are commanded to redeem is commanded to redeem himself, and any</b> person <b>whom others are not commanded to redeem is not commanded to redeem himself.</b> Since there is no mitzva for a parent to redeem his daughter, there is similarly no mitzva for a daughter to redeem herself. <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that others are not commanded to redeem</b> a daughter? <b>As the verse states: “All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem”</b> (Exodus 34:20), i.e., <b>your sons and not your daughters.</b>
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If a firstborn has not yet been redeemed and he himself has a firstborn son, he is obligated <b>to redeem himself and</b> he is also obligated <b>to redeem his</b> firstborn <b>son,</b> and <b>he takes precedence over his son.</b> If he does not have enough money to redeem both of them, he redeems himself. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: His son takes precedence over him.</b> Rabbi Yehuda’s reasoning is <b>that</b> with regard to <b>this</b> one, the father, the <b>mitzva</b> of <b>his</b> redemption was <b>upon his father,</b> and only when his father did not observe the mitzva did it apply to the adult son. <b>And that mitzva of</b> the redemption of <b>his</b> firstborn <b>son applies to him</b> directly. Consequently, he should first fulfill the mitzva that applies to him by redeeming his son.
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya says: Everyone agrees</b>

Daf 29b

that <b>anywhere that there are only five <i>sela</i></b> available, i.e., enough to redeem only one man, and one is obligated to redeem both himself and his son, <b>he,</b> the father, <b>takes precedence over his son. What is the reason?</b> It is that <b>his own mitzva is preferable</b> to one that he performs on behalf of others. <b>When they disagree</b> is in a case <b>where there is</b> land worth <b>five</b> <i>sela</i> that is <b>liened</b> property that has been sold, i.e., he sold this land to other people but it can be reclaimed by his prior creditor, <b>and five</b> <i>sela</i> which is entirely <b>unsold</b> property.
And the reasoning behind the dispute is as follows: <b>Rabbi Yehuda maintains</b> that <b>a loan that is written in the Torah,</b> i.e., any financial obligation that applies by Torah law, is <b>considered as though it is written in a document,</b> and therefore it can be collected from liened property, like any loan recorded in a document. This means that the liened property worth five <i>sela</i> is available for one’s own redemption, but not for that of his son, as the sale of the property occurred before the birth of his firstborn. Consequently, <b>with these five</b> <i>sela</i> upon which there is no lien <b>he redeems his son, and</b> the <b>priest goes and repossesses</b> the land worth <b>five</b> <i>sela</i> that is <b>liened</b> property <b>for his</b> own redemption. In this manner one can fulfill both mitzvot.
<b>And the Rabbis maintain: A loan that is written in the Torah is not considered as though it is written in a document,</b> since buyers will not be aware of this obligation, so that they should be aware that the land may be repossessed. <b>And therefore</b> there is no advantage for this man to redeem his son with the five <i>sela</i> upon which there is no lien, and <b>his own mitzva is preferable,</b> which means he redeems himself with the free land. With the liened property that is left he cannot redeem his son, as the land was sold before the birth of his firstborn.
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If one has money <b>to redeem his son and to ascend to</b> Jerusalem on <b>the pilgrimage Festival, he redeems his son and then ascends</b> to Jerusalem <b>on the pilgrimage Festival. Rabbi Yehuda says: He ascends</b> to Jerusalem <b>on the pilgrimage Festival and then redeems his son.</b> His reasoning is <b>that this</b> trip to Jerusalem for the pilgrimage Festival is <b>a mitzva</b> whose time soon <b>passes, and this,</b> the redemption of the firstborn son, is <b>a mitzva</b> whose time does <b>not</b> soon <b>pass,</b> as it can be fulfilled later.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> it is <b>as he stated</b> in <b>his reasoning,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda provided the rationale for his opinion. <b>But what is the reasoning of the Rabbis,</b> who say that he should first redeem his son? The Gemara answers that the reason is <b>that the verse states: “All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem”</b> (Exodus 34:20), <b>and</b> it <b>then</b> states, in the same verse: <b>“And none shall appear before me empty,”</b> referring to the pilgrimage Festival in Jerusalem. The order of the verse indicates that one should redeem his firstborn son before traveling to Jerusalem on the pilgrimage Festival.
<b>The Sages taught: From where</b> is it derived <b>that if one had five</b> firstborn <b>sons, from five</b> different <b>women, he is obligated to redeem them all? The verse states: “All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem”</b> (Exodus 34:20), and the emphasis of “all” includes any of one’s firstborn sons. The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> it <b>obvious</b> this is the case? After all, <b>the Merciful One made</b> this mitzva <b>dependent upon the opening of the womb,</b> as it states: “Sanctify to Me all the firstborn, whoever opens the womb” (Exodus 13:2). Since each of these sons is the firstborn of his mother, it is clear that the father is required to redeem each of them.
The Gemara answers that this ruling is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that <b>we should derive</b> a verbal analogy between <b>“firstborn”</b> stated here and <b>“firstborn” from</b> the verses dealing with <b>inheritance: Just as there,</b> the verse describes a firstborn who receives a double portion of the inheritance as: <b>“The first fruit of his strength”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17), i.e., he is the firstborn son to his father, and not the first child born to his mother; <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the redemption of the firstborn son, it is referring to the <b>first fruit of his strength,</b> which would mean that the father need redeem only his oldest child. Therefore, this <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case. Rather, every firstborn son to his mother must be redeemed.
§ The <i>baraita</i> teaches that a father is obligated <b>to teach</b> his son <b>Torah.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this requirement? <b>As it is written: “And you shall teach them [<i>velimadtem</i>] to your sons”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:19). <b>And</b> in a case <b>where his father did not teach him he is obligated to teach himself, as it is written,</b> i.e., the verse can be read with a different vocalization: <b>And you shall study [<i>ulmadtem</i>].</b>
<b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> a woman <b>is not obligated</b> to teach her son Torah? <b>As it is written: “And you shall teach [<i>velimadtem</i>],”</b> which can be read as: <b>And you shall study [<i>ulmadtem</i>].</b> This indicates that <b>whoever is commanded to study</b> Torah <b>is commanded to teach, and whoever is not commanded to study is not commanded to teach.</b> Since a woman is not obligated to learn Torah, she is likewise not obligated to teach it.
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that she is not obligated to teach herself?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And you shall teach [<i>velimadtem</i>],”</b> which can be read as: <b>And you shall study [<i>ulmadtem</i>],</b> which indicates that <b>whoever others are commanded to teach is commanded to teach himself, and whoever others are not commanded to teach is not commanded to teach himself. And from where</b> is it derived <b>that others are not commanded to teach</b> a woman? <b>As the verse states: “And you shall teach them to your sons”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:19), which emphasizes: <b>Your sons and not your daughters.</b>
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If <b>one</b> wishes <b>to study</b> Torah himself <b>and his son</b> also wants <b>to study, he takes precedence over his son. Rabbi Yehuda says: If his son is diligent and sharp, and his study will endure, his son takes precedence over him.</b> This is <b>like that</b> anecdote <b>which</b> is told about <b>Rav Ya’akov, son of Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov, whose father sent him to Abaye</b> to study Torah. <b>When</b> the son <b>came</b> home, his father <b>saw that his studies were not sharp,</b> as he was insufficiently bright. Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov <b>said to</b> his son: <b>I am preferable to you,</b> and it is better that I go and study. Therefore, <b>you sit</b> and handle the affairs of the house <b>so that I can go</b> and study.
<b>Abaye heard</b> that Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov <b>was coming. There was a certain demon in the study hall of Abaye,</b> which was so powerful <b>that when two</b> people would <b>enter they would be harmed, even during the day.</b> Abaye <b>said to</b> the people of the town: <b>Do not give</b> Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov <b>lodging [<i>ushpiza</i>]</b> so that he will be forced to spend the night in the study hall. Since Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov is a righteous man, <b>perhaps a miracle will occur</b> on his behalf and he will kill the demon.
Rav Aḥa found no place to spend the night, and <b>he entered and spent the night in that study hall</b> of <b>the Sages.</b> The demon <b>appeared to him like a serpent</b> with <b>seven heads.</b> Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov began to pray, and with <b>every bow</b> that <b>he bowed one</b> of the demon’s <b>heads fell off,</b> until it eventually died. The <b>next day</b> Rav Aḥa <b>said to</b> the townspeople: <b>If a miracle had not occurred, you would have placed me in danger.</b>
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If one has to decide whether <b>to study Torah or to marry a woman,</b> which should he do first? <b>He should study Torah and afterward marry a woman. And if it is impossible for him</b> to be <b>without a wife, he should marry a woman and then study Torah. Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that one should <b>marry a woman and afterward study Torah.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> How can one do this? With <b>a millstone</b> hanging <b>from his neck,</b> i.e., with the responsibility of providing for his family weighing upon him, can <b>he engage in Torah</b> study? The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> the <i>amora’im</i> <b>do not disagree; this is for us and that is for them.</b> In other words, one statement applies to the residents of Babylonia, whereas the other is referring to those living in Eretz Yisrael.
§ With regard to marriage, the Gemara relates: <b>Rav Ḥisda would praise Rav Hamnuna to Rav Huna</b> by saying <b>that he is a great man.</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him: When he comes to you, send him to me. When</b> Rav Hamnuna <b>came</b> before him, Rav Huna <b>saw that he did not cover</b> his head with <b>a cloth,</b> as Torah scholars did. Rav Huna <b>said to him: What is the reason</b> that <b>you do not cover</b> your head <b>with a cloth?</b> Rav Hamnuna <b>said to him:</b> The reason is <b>that I am not married,</b> and it was not customary for unmarried men to cover their heads with a cloth. Rav Huna <b>turned his face away from him</b> in rebuke, and <b>he said to him: See</b> to it <b>that you do not see my face until you marry.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>Rav Huna</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he says:</b> If one is <b>twenty years old and has not</b> yet <b>married a woman, all of his days</b> will be <b>in</b> a state of <b>sin</b> concerning sexual matters. The Gemara asks: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that he will be <b>in</b> a state of <b>sin</b> all of his days? <b>Rather, say</b> that this means the following: <b>All of his days</b> will be <b>in</b> a state of <b>thoughts of sin,</b> i.e., sexual thoughts. One who does not marry in his youth will become accustomed to thoughts of sexual matters, and the habit will remain with him the rest of his life.
<b>Rava said, and similarly, the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Until</b> one reaches the age of <b>twenty years the Holy One, Blessed be He, sits and waits for a man,</b> saying: <b>When will he marry a woman? Once he reaches</b> the age of <b>twenty and has not married, He says: Let his bones swell,</b> i.e., he is cursed and God is no longer concerned about him.
<b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The fact <b>that I am superior to my colleagues</b> is <b>because I married</b> at the age of <b>sixteen, and if I would have married at</b> the age of <b>fourteen,</b>

Daf 30a

<b>I would say to the Satan: An arrow in your eye,</b> i.e., I would not be afraid of the evil inclination at all. <b>Rava said to Rabbi Natan bar Ami: While your hand is still on your son’s neck,</b> i.e., while you still have authority and control over him, find him a wife. What is the appropriate age? <b>From sixteen until twenty-two, and some say from eighteen until twenty-four.</b>
The Gemara notes that this is <b>like</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> based on the verse: <b>“Train a child in the way that he should go”</b> (Proverbs 22:6). <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya</b> disagreed about the age in which the verse instructs the parent to educate his child: <b>One said</b> that the verse is referring to the ages <b>from sixteen until twenty-two, and one said</b> it is referring to the ages <b>from eighteen until twenty-four.</b> The dispute concerning the correct age for marriage and the dispute about educating a child are the same, as while a father still has a large measure of influence over his son, he must both teach him and find him a wife.
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of a father’s obligation to teach his son Torah. <b>To what</b> extent <b>is a person obligated to teach his son Torah? Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> One should emulate the education of, <b>for example, Zevulun ben Dan,</b> a contemporary of Shmuel, <b>whose father’s father taught him Bible, Mishna, Talmud, <i>halakhot</i>, and <i>aggadot</i>. The Gemara raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If a father <b>taught</b> his son <b>Bible,</b> he is <b>not</b> required to <b>teach him Mishna. And Rava said</b> in explanation of this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Bible is</b> the <b>Torah,</b> not the Prophets or Writings, i.e., he is not required to teach him anything else, including Mishna.
The Gemara answers that Shmuel’s statement should be understood as follows: One should teach his son <b>like Zevulun ben Dan was taught</b> in certain aspects, <b>but not like Zevulun ben Dan</b> in other respects. One should teach his son <b>like Zevulun ben Dan</b> in <b>that his father’s father taught him; but not like Zevulun ben Dan, as there</b> he was taught <b>Bible, Mishna, Talmud, <i>halakhot</i>, and <i>aggadot</i>, while here,</b> in this <i>baraita</i>, one is required to teach his son <b>Bible alone.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But is one’s father’s father obligated</b> to teach him Torah? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, that the verse: <b>“And you shall teach them to your sons”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:19), indicates: <b>But not your sons’ sons? And how do I realize,</b> i.e., understand, the meaning of the verse: <b>“But make them known to your sons and to your sons’ sons”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:9)? This serves <b>to say to you</b> that <b>whoever teaches his son Torah, the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as though he taught him, and his son, and his son’s son, until the end of all generations.</b>
The Gemara answers that the <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i> <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: From the verse <b>“And you shall teach them to your sons” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that you must teach <b>your sons. From where do</b> I derive that there is an obligation to teach <b>your sons’ sons? The verse states: “But make them known to your sons and to your sons’ sons.” If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Your sons”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:19), which implies only sons? This limitation teaches: <b>Your sons, but not your daughters.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Anyone who teaches his son’s son Torah, the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as though he received it from Mount Sinai, as it is stated: “But make them known to your sons and to your sons’ sons,” and juxtaposed to it</b> is the phrase in the verse: <b>“The day when you stood before the Lord your God in Horeb”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:10), as Horeb is Mount Sinai.
The Gemara relates: Once <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba encountered Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi,</b> and saw <b>that he had placed</b> an inexpensive <b>covering on his head and brought</b> his <b>child to the synagogue</b> to study. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <b>said to him: What</b> is the reason for <b>all this</b> fuss, as you are in such a hurry that you do not have time to dress yourself properly? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said to him: Is it insignificant, that which is written: “But make them known to your sons,” and juxtaposed to it</b> is the phrase in the verse that states: <b>“The day when you stood before the Lord your God in Horeb”?</b> The Gemara comments: <b>From this</b> moment <b>onward, Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba would not taste meat [<i>umtza</i>],</b> meaning he would not eat breakfast, <b>before he had read to</b> his <b>child and added to</b> the child’s studies from the day before. Similarly, <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna would not taste meat before he had brought</b> his <b>child to the study hall.</b>
§ <b>Rav Safra says in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And you shall teach them diligently [<i>veshinnantam</i>] to your sons”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:7)? <b>Do not read</b> this as <b>“<i>veshinnantam</i>,”</b> with the root <i>shin</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>nun</i>, which indicates a repetition. <b>Rather,</b> read it as <b><i>veshillashtam</i>,</b> with the root <i>shin</i>, <i>lamed</i>, <i>shin</i>, related to the word three, <i>shalosh</i>. This means that one must study, review, and study again, thereby dividing one’s studies into three parts.
In light of this statement, the Sages said that <b>a person should always divide his years into three</b> parts, as follows: <b>A third for Bible, a third for Mishna, and a third for Talmud.</b> The Gemara asks: How can a person divide his life this way? <b>Who knows the length of his life,</b> so that he can calculate how long a third will be? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary for</b> one’s <b>days,</b> i.e., one should divide each day of his life in this manner.
<b>Therefore,</b> because they devoted so much time to the Bible, the <b>first</b> Sages <b>were called: Those who count [<i>soferim</i>],</b> because <b>they would count all the letters in the Torah, as they would say</b> that the letter <b><i>vav</i></b> in the word <b>“belly [<i>gaḥon</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 11:42) <b>is the midpoint of the letters in a Torah scroll.</b> The words: <b>“Diligently inquired [<i>darosh darash</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 10:16), <b>are the midpoint of the words</b> in a Torah scroll. And the verse that begins with: <b>“Then he shall be shaven”</b> (Leviticus 13:33), is the midpoint <b>of</b> the <b>verses.</b> Similarly, in the expression: <b>“The boar out of the wood [<i>miya’ar</i>] ravages it”</b> (Psalms 80:14), <b>the <i>ayin</i> in</b> the word wood <b>[<i>ya’ar</i>]</b> is the <b>midpoint of Psalms,</b> with regard to its number of letters. The verse: <b>“But He, being full of compassion, forgives iniquity”</b> (Psalms 78:38), <b>is the midpoint</b> of <b>verses</b> in the book of Psalms.
<b>Rav Yosef raises a dilemma:</b> Does the <b><i>vav</i> of</b> the word <b>“belly [<i>gaḥon</i>]”</b> belong <b>to this side or to this side?</b> Is it part of the first or second half of the Torah? The Sages <b>said to him: Let us bring a Torah scroll and count</b> the letters. <b>Didn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say</b> with regard to a different issue: <b>They did not move from there until they brought a Torah scroll and counted</b> the letters? Therefore we can do the same. Rav Yosef <b>said to them: They</b> were <b>experts</b> in the <b>deficient and plene</b> forms of words and therefore could count the letters precisely. <b>We are not experts</b> in this regard, and therefore we would be unable to resolve the question even if we were to count the letters.
Similarly, <b>Rav Yosef raises a dilemma:</b> Does the midpoint of the verses in the Torah, which is <b>“then he shall be shaven,”</b> belong <b>to this side or to this side? Abaye said to him:</b> Even if we cannot count the letters, <b>we can at least bring</b> a Torah scroll <b>to count the verses.</b> Rav Yosef explained: <b>We are not experts about verses either, as when Rav Aḥa bar Adda came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said: In the West,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael, <b>they divide this</b> following <b>verse into three</b> separate <b>verses: “And the Lord said to Moses, behold I come to you in a thick cloud,</b> that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever; And Moses told the words of the people to the Lord” (Exodus 19:9). Perhaps there are other verses that we do not know how to divide properly.
<b>The Sages taught: Five thousand eight hundred and eighty-eight verses are the verses in a Torah scroll. Psalms has eight more</b> verses <b>than that,</b> and <b>Chronicles</b> has <b>eight fewer</b> verses <b>than that.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“And you shall teach them diligently [<i>veshinnantam</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:7). The root <i>shin</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>nun</i>, of <i>veshinnantam</i> should be understood as meaning sharp, i.e., <b>that matters of Torah should be sharp</b> and clear <b>in your mouth,</b> so <b>that if a person asks you something, do not stutter</b> in uncertainty <b>and say</b> an uncertain response <b>to him. Rather, answer him immediately, as it is stated:</b>

Daf 30b

<b>“Say to wisdom: You are my sister,</b> and call understanding your kinswoman” (Proverbs 7:4), which indicates that one should be as knowledgeable in the Torah as in the identity of his sister. <b>And it states: “Bind them upon your fingers, you shall write them upon the tablet of your heart”</b> (Proverbs 7:3). <b>And it states: “As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of one’s youth”</b> (Psalms 127:4). <b>And it states: “Sharp arrows of the mighty”</b> (Psalms 120:4). <b>And it states: “Your arrows are sharp, the peoples fall under you”</b> (Psalms 45:6). <b>And it states: “Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them; they shall not be put to shame when they speak with their enemies in the gate”</b> (Psalms 127:5).
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“enemies in the gate”</b> with regard to Torah study? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says: Even a father and his son,</b> or <b>a rabbi and his student, who are engaged in Torah</b> together <b>in one gate become enemies with each other</b> due to the intensity of their studies. <b>But they do not leave there until they love each other, as it is stated</b> in the verse discussing the places the Jewish people engaged in battle in the wilderness: “Therefore it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord, <b>Vahev in Suphah [<i>beSufa</i>],</b> and the valleys of Arnon” (Numbers 21:14). The word “<i>vahev</i>” is interpreted as related to the word for love, <i>ahava</i>. Additionally, <b>do not read</b> this as <b>“in Suphah [<i>beSufa</i>]”; rather,</b> read it as <b>“at its end [<i>besofa</i>],”</b> i.e., at the conclusion of their dispute they are beloved to each other.
<b>The Sages taught: “And you shall place [<i>vesamtem</i>]</b> these words of Mine in your hearts” (Deuteronomy 11:18). Read this as though it stated <b><i>sam tam</i>, a perfect elixir. The Torah is compared to an elixir of life.</b> There is <b>a parable that</b> illustrates this: <b>A person hit his son with a strong blow and placed a bandage on his wound. And he said to him: My son, as long as this bandage is on your wound</b> and is healing you, <b>eat what you enjoy and drink what you enjoy, and bathe in either hot water or cold water, and you do not need to be afraid,</b> as it will heal your wound. <b>But if you take it off,</b> the wound <b>will become gangrenous.</b>
<b>So</b> too <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Israel: My children, I created an evil inclination,</b> which is the wound, <b>and I created Torah as its antidote. If you are engaged in Torah</b> study <b>you will not be given over into the hand</b> of the evil inclination, <b>as it is stated: “If you do well, shall it not be lifted up?”</b> (Genesis 4:7). One who engages in Torah study lifts himself above the evil inclination.
<b>And if you do not engage in Torah</b> study, <b>you are given over to its power, as it is stated: “Sin crouches at the door”</b> (Genesis 4:7). <b>Moreover, all</b> of the evil inclination’s <b>deliberations</b> will be <b>concerning you, as it is stated</b> in the same verse: <b>“And to you is its desire.” And if you wish you shall rule over it, as it is stated</b> in the conclusion of the verse: <b>“But you may rule over it”</b> (Genesis 4:7).
<b>The Sages taught:</b> So <b>difficult is the evil inclination that even its Creator calls it evil, as it is stated: “For the inclination of a man’s heart is evil from his youth”</b> (Genesis 8:21). <b>Rav Yitzḥak says: A person’s</b> evil <b>inclination renews itself to him every day, as it is stated:</b> “And that every inclination of the thoughts in his heart was <b>only evil all day [<i>kol hayyom</i>]”</b> (Genesis 6:5). “<i>Kol hayyom</i>” can also be understood as: Every day.
<b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Levi says: A person’s inclination overpowers him every day, and seeks to kill him, as it is stated: “The wicked watches the righteous and seeks to slay him”</b> (Psalms 37:32). <b>And if not</b> for the fact that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, assists</b> each person in battling his evil inclination, <b>he could not</b> overcome <b>it, as it is stated: “The Lord will not leave him in his hand”</b> (Psalms 37:33).
A Sage from <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: My son, if this wretched one,</b> the evil inclination, <b>encounters you, pull it into the study hall,</b> i.e., go and study Torah. <b>If it is a stone</b> it will <b>melt, and if it is iron</b> it will <b>break, as it is stated</b> with regard to the Torah: <b>“Is not My word like fire, says the Lord, and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?”</b> (Jeremiah 23:29). Just as a stone shatters a hammer, so too one can overcome his evil inclination, which is as strong as iron, through Torah study. With regard to the second part of the statement: <b>If it is a stone</b> it will <b>melt,</b> this is <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the Torah: <b>“Ho, everyone who thirsts, come for water”</b> (Isaiah 55:1), <b>and it states: “The water wears the stones”</b> (Job 14:19), indicating that water is stronger than stone.
§ The <i>baraita</i> (29a) teaches that a father is commanded <b>to marry</b> his son to <b>a woman.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this matter? <b>As it is written: “Take wives and bear sons and daughters, and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to men”</b> (Jeremiah 29:6).
The Gemara analyzes this verse: <b>Granted</b> with regard to <b>his son,</b> this is <b>in his power,</b> i.e., he can instruct him to marry a woman, as a man is the active agent in a marriage. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>his daughter, is</b> this <b>in his power?</b> She must wait for a man to marry her. The Gemara answers: <b>This is what</b> Jeremiah was <b>saying to them</b> in the aforementioned verse: Her father should <b>give her something</b> for her dowry, <b>and he should dress and cover her</b> with suitable clothing <b>so that men will leap to</b> marry <b>her.</b>
§ The <i>baraita</i> further states that a father is commanded <b>to teach</b> his son <b>a trade.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Ḥizkiyya said: As the verse states: “Enjoy life with the wife whom you love”</b> (Ecclesiastes 9:9). <b>If</b> this verse is interpreted literally, and <b>it</b> is referring to <b>an actual woman,</b> then one can derive as follows: <b>Just as</b> a father <b>is obligated to marry</b> his son <b>to a woman, so too, he is obligated to teach him a trade,</b> as indicated by the term: Life. <b>And if</b> the wife mentioned in this verse is allegorical, and <b>it is the Torah,</b> then one should explain the verse in the following manner: <b>Just as he is obligated to teach him Torah, so too, he is obligated to teach him a trade.</b>
§ The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And some say</b> that a father is <b>also</b> obligated <b>to teach</b> his son <b>to swim in a river.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>It is</b> necessary for <b>his life,</b> i.e., this is potentially a lifesaving skill.
§ The <i>baraita</i> further teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Any</b> father <b>who does not teach</b> his son <b>a trade teaches him banditry.</b> The Gemara asks: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that he actually teaches him <b>banditry? Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means that it is <b>as though he taught him banditry.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between</b> the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> and that of Rabbi Yehuda? Both state that a father must teach his son a trade. The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a difference <b>between them</b> in a case <b>where</b> the father <b>teaches him</b> to engage in <b>business.</b> According to the first <i>tanna</i> this is sufficient, whereas Rabbi Yehuda maintains that he must teach him an actual trade.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>all mitzvot of a father with regard to his son,</b> both men and women are obligated to perform them. The Gemara inquires: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the expression: <b>All mitzvot of a father with regard to his son? If we say</b> that this is referring to <b>all of the mitzvot that a father is required to perform for his son,</b> are <b>women obligated</b> in these? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A father is obligated with regard to his son to circumcise him, and to redeem him?</b> This indicates that <b>his father, yes,</b> he is obligated to do these, but <b>his mother, no,</b> she is not obligated to perform these mitzvot for her son.
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying:</b> With regard to <b>each mitzva</b> for <b>the father that is incumbent upon the son to perform for his father, both men and women are obligated</b> in them. The Gemara comments: <b>We</b> already <b>learned this, as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with regard to the verse: <b>“A man</b> shall fear [<i>tira’u</i>] his mother and his father” (Leviticus 19:3). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a man</b> is obligated in this mitzva; <b>from where</b> do I derive that <b>a woman</b> is also obligated? <b>When it says</b> in the same verse: <b>“A man shall fear [<i>tira’u</i>] his mother and his father”</b> (Leviticus 19:3), employing the plural form of the verb, this indicates that <b>there are two</b> that are obligated <b>here,</b> both a man and a woman.
<b>If so,</b> that both of them are obligated, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Man”?</b> In the case of <b>a man,</b> it is <b>in his power to perform</b> this mitzva; whereas with regard to <b>a woman,</b> it is <b>not</b> always <b>in her power to perform</b> this mitzva, <b>because she is under the authority of another</b> person, i.e., her husband. As she is obligated to her husband to maintain her household, she is not always able to find time for her parents. <b>Rav Idi bar Avin says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> Consequently, if a woman <b>is divorced,</b> then <b>both of them,</b> a daughter and a son, are <b>equal</b> with regard to honoring and fearing their father and mother.
<b>The Sages taught</b> that <b>it is stated: “Honor your father and your mother”</b> (Exodus 20:11), <b>and it is stated: “Honor the Lord with your wealth”</b> (Proverbs 3:9). In this manner, <b>the verse equates the honor of one’s father and mother to the honor of the Omnipresent,</b> as the term “honor” is used in both cases.
Similarly, <b>it is stated: “A man shall fear his mother and his father”</b> (Leviticus 19:3), <b>and it is stated: “You shall fear the Lord your God and Him you shall serve”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:13). <b>The verse equates the fear of one’s father and mother to the fear of the Omnipresent.</b>
Likewise, <b>it is stated: “He who curses his father or his mother shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 21:17), <b>and it is stated: “Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin”</b> (Leviticus 24:15). <b>The verse equates the blessing,</b> a euphemism for cursing, <b>of</b> one’s <b>father and mother to the blessing of the Omnipresent. But with regard to striking,</b> i.e., with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that one who strikes his father or mother is liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment, <b>it is certainly not possible</b> to say the same concerning the Holy One, Blessed be He.
<b>And so</b> too, the equating of one’s attitude toward his parents to his attitude toward God is <b>a logical derivation, as the three of them are partners in his</b> creation. As <b>the Sages taught: There are three partners in</b> the forming of <b>a person: The Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> who provides the soul, <b>and his father and his mother. When a person honors his father and mother, the Holy One, Blessed be He, says: I ascribe</b> credit <b>to them as if I dwelt between them and they honor Me</b> as well.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: It is revealed and known before the One Who spoke and the world came into being that a son honors his mother more than</b> he honors <b>his father, because</b>

Daf 31a

<b>she persuades him with</b> many <b>statements</b> of encouragement and does not treat him harshly. <b>Therefore,</b> in the mitzva of: “Honor your father and your mother” (Exodus 20:11), <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, preceded</b> the mention of <b>the honor</b> due one’s <b>father before</b> mentioning the <b>honor</b> due one’s <b>mother.</b> The verse emphasizes the duty that does not come naturally. Similarly, <b>it is revealed and known before the One Who spoke and the world came into being that a son fears his father more than his mother, because</b> his father <b>teaches him Torah,</b> and consequently he is strict with him. <b>Therefore,</b> in the verse: “A man shall fear his mother and his father” (Leviticus 19:3), <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, preceded</b> the mention of <b>fear of the mother before</b> the mention of <b>fear of the father.</b>
<b>A <i>tanna</i> taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Naḥman: When a person causes his father and mother suffering, the Holy One, Blessed be He, says: I did well in not dwelling among them, for if I had dwelled among them they would have caused Me suffering</b> as well, as it were. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: Anyone who transgresses in private, it is</b> considered <b>as though he is pushing away the feet of the Divine Presence,</b> i.e., he distances God from him, so to speak. <b>As it is stated: “So says the Lord: The heaven is My throne and the earth is My footstool”</b> (Isaiah 66:1). When someone sins in secret, he demonstrates that he thinks God is absent from that place, and it is as though he pushes His feet away from the earth.
With regard to the same issue, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> It is <b>prohibited for a person to walk</b> even <b>four cubits with an upright posture,</b> which is considered an arrogant manner, <b>as it is stated: “The entire world is full of His glory”</b> (Isaiah 6:3). One who walks in an arrogant manner indicates a lack of regard for the glory and honor of God that is surrounding him, and thereby chases God from that place, as it were. The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, would not walk four cubits with an uncovered head. He said: The Divine Presence is above my head,</b> and I must act respectfully.
<b>The son of one widow asked Rabbi Eliezer:</b> If my <b>father says</b> to me: <b>Give me water to drink, and</b> my <b>mother</b> also <b>says</b> to me: <b>Give me water to drink, which of them</b> should I honor <b>first?</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to him: Set</b> aside <b>the honor of your mother, and perform the honor of your father, as you and your mother are</b> both <b>obligated in the honor of your father. He came before Rabbi Yehoshua and</b> asked him the same question, and Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said this</b> same answer <b>to him.</b>
The man <b>said to him: My teacher,</b> if one’s mother <b>is divorced, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: From your eyelashes,</b> which are filled with tears, <b>it is evident that you are the son of a widow,</b> and you have no father. Why, then, are you asking this question as though it were relevant for you? Consequently, Rabbi Yehoshua answered him sarcastically: <b>Pour water for them into a pitcher and squawk at them as</b> one does to summon <b>chickens.</b> In other words, if one’s mother is divorced, the same honor is due to both parents, and neither takes precedence.
§ <b>Ulla the Great interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically at the entrance to the house of the <i>Nasi</i>. What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “All the kings of the earth shall give You thanks, O Lord, for they have heard the words of Your mouth”</b> (Psalms 138:4)? It <b>is not stated: The word of Your mouth,</b> in the singular. <b>Rather,</b> the verse uses the expression: <b>“The words of Your mouth,”</b> in the plural. To what is this phrase referring? <b>When the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: “I am</b> the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2), <b>and,</b> in the same verse: <b>“You shall have no</b> other gods before Me,” <b>the nations of the world said: He teaches</b> this <b>for His own honor,</b> as both statements entail respect for God.
<b>Once He said: “Honor your father and your mother”</b> (Exodus 20:11), <b>they returned and conceded</b> the truth <b>of the first statements,</b> which is why the verse uses the plural expression: “Words of Your mouth,” i.e., all the words of God’s mouth. <b>Rava said:</b> This can be derived <b>from here: “The beginning of Your word is truth”</b> (Psalms 119:160). Is <b>the beginning of Your word</b> truth <b>but not the end of Your word? Rather, from the end of Your word it is apparent</b> to everyone <b>that the beginning of Your word is truth.</b>
The Sages <b>raised a dilemma before Rav Ulla: How far</b> must one go to fulfill the mitzva of <b>honoring one’s father and mother?</b> Rav Ulla <b>said to them: Go and see what one gentile did in Ashkelon, and his name was Dama ben Netina. Once the Sages sought</b> to purchase <b>merchandise [<i>perakmatya</i>]</b> from him <b>for six hundred thousand</b> gold dinars’ <b>profit, but the key</b> for the container in which the merchandise was kept <b>was placed under his father’s head,</b> and he was sleeping at the time. <b>And</b> Dama ben Netina would <b>not disturb</b> his father by waking him, although he could have made a substantial profit.
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: They asked Rabbi Eliezer: How far</b> must one go to fulfill the mitzva <b>of honoring one’s father and mother?</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to them: Go and see what one gentile did for his father in Ashkelon, and</b> the <b>name</b> of the son <b>was Dama ben Netina.</b> Once <b>the Sages wished</b> to purchase precious <b>stones from him for the ephod</b> of the High Priest <b>for six hundred thousand</b> gold dinars’ <b>profit, and Rav Kahana taught</b> that it was <b>eight hundred thousand</b> gold dinars’ profit. <b>And the key</b> to the chest holding the jewels <b>was placed under his father’s head, and he</b> would <b>not disturb him.</b>
<b>The next year the Holy One, Blessed be He, gave</b> Dama ben Netina <b>his reward, as a red heifer was born in his herd,</b> and the Jews needed it. When <b>the Sages of Israel came to him he said to them: I know,</b> concerning <b>you, that if I</b> were to <b>ask for all the money in the world you</b> would <b>give</b> it <b>to me. But I ask only that money that I lost due to</b> the <b>honor of Father.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Ḥanina says: And if</b> this is related about <b>one who is not commanded</b> by the Torah to honor his father, as Dama was a gentile, <b>and</b> nevertheless when <b>he performs</b> the mitzva he is given <b>this</b> great reward, <b>all the more so</b> is one rewarded who is <b>commanded</b> to fulfill a mitzva <b>and performs</b> it. <b>As Rabbi Ḥanina says: Greater</b> is one who <b>is commanded</b> to do a mitzva <b>and performs</b> it <b>than one who is not commanded</b> to do a mitzva <b>and performs</b> it.
<b>Rav Yosef,</b> who was blind, <b>said: At first I would say:</b> If <b>someone would tell me</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says: A blind person is exempt from</b> fulfilling <b>the mitzvot, I would make a festive day for the rabbis, as I am not commanded and yet I perform</b> the mitzvot. This means my reward is very great. <b>Now that I have heard that which Rabbi Ḥanina says: Greater</b> is one who <b>is commanded</b> to do a mitzva <b>and performs</b> it <b>than one who is not commanded</b> to do a mitzva <b>and performs</b> it, <b>on the contrary:</b> If <b>someone would tell me</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> and a blind person is obligated in mitzvot, <b>I would make a festive day for the rabbis.</b>
<b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said: Once</b> Dama ben Netina <b>was wearing a fine cloak [<i>sirkon</i>] of gold, and was sitting among the nobles</b> of <b>Rome. And his mother came to him and tore</b> his garment <b>from him and smacked him on the head and spat in his face, and</b> yet <b>he did not embarrass her.</b>
<b>Avimi, son of Rabbi Abbahu, taught: There is</b> a type of son <b>who feeds his father pheasant [<i>pasyonei</i>] and</b> yet this behavior <b>causes him to be removed from the World,</b> i.e., the World-to-Come; <b>and there is</b> one <b>who makes him grind with a millstone,</b> which is difficult work,

Daf 31b

and this action <b>brings him to the life of the World-to-Come.</b>
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> One <b>such as Avimi, my son,</b> properly <b>fulfilled the mitzva of honoring</b> his parents. The Gemara relates: <b>Avimi had five sons during his father’s lifetime</b> who were <b>ordained</b> to issue halakhic rulings, and he too was ordained. <b>And</b> yet <b>when Rabbi Abbahu,</b> his father, <b>came and called at the gate</b> to enter, Avimi <b>would</b> himself <b>run and go to open</b> the door <b>for him. And before he arrived there, he</b> would already <b>say: Yes, yes,</b> so that his father would not think that he was being ignored.
<b>One day</b> Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to</b> Avimi his son: <b>Give me water to drink. Before he brought him</b> the water, Rabbi Abbahu <b>dozed off.</b> Avimi <b>bent over</b> and <b>stood over him until</b> his father <b>awoke.</b> The performance of this mitzva <b>aided him,</b> i.e., as a reward God helped him in his studies, <b>and</b> Avimi succeeded in homiletically <b>interpreting</b> the psalm: <b>“A song to Asaph”</b> (Psalms 79).
<b>Rav Ya’akov bar Avuh said to Abaye:</b> With regard to one <b>such as I,</b> so beloved by my parents that <b>before I return from the study hall my father brings me a cup and my mother pours for me, how should I act?</b> Is it disrespectful to accept this honor from them? Abaye <b>said to him: Accept</b> it <b>from your mother, but do not accept it from your father, as, since he is a Torah scholar he will be disheartened</b> if his son does not show him the proper level of respect.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Tarfon had a certain</b> manner of treating his <b>mother, that whenever she wished to ascend into</b> her <b>bed he would bend over and</b> help <b>her to ascend, and whenever she wished to descend</b> from the bed, <b>she would descend onto him. He came and praised</b> himself in the <b>study hall</b> for performing the mitzva of honoring one’s father and mother so thoroughly. <b>They said to him: You still have not reached even half of</b> the <b>honor</b> due to her. <b>Has</b> it ever happened that <b>she threw a purse into the sea in front of you, and you did not embarrass her?</b>
<b>When Rav Yosef heard his mother’s footsteps, he</b> would <b>say: I will stand before the arriving Divine Presence. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Fortunate is one who never saw</b> his father and mother, as it is so difficult to honor them appropriately. The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> himself never saw his parents. <b>When his mother was pregnant with him, his father died;</b> and when <b>she gave birth to him, his mother died. And the same</b> is true of <b>Abaye.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so,</b> that Abaye never saw his mother? <b>But didn’t Abaye say</b> on many occasions: <b>My mother told me?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> mother <b>was</b> actually <b>his foster mother,</b> not his birth mother.
<b>Rav Asi had an elderly mother. She said to him: I want jewelry,</b> and <b>he made</b> jewelry <b>for her.</b> She said to him: <b>I want a man</b> whom I can marry, and he said to her: <b>I will seek</b> one <b>for you.</b> She said to him: <b>I want a husband who is as handsome as you.</b> At this point, he realized that she was senile, and that he would be unable to fulfill all her requests. Therefore, <b>he left her and went to Eretz Yisrael.</b>
Rav Asi <b>heard that she was following him</b> to Eretz Yisrael. <b>He came before Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> and <b>said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>leaving Eretz</b> Yisrael to go <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> It is <b>prohibited.</b> Rav Asi further asked: If one is going <b>to greet</b> his <b>mother, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: I do not know.</b> Rav Asi <b>waited a little</b> while, and <b>then came</b> back to him. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: Asi, you are</b> evidently <b>determined to leave.</b> May <b>the Omnipresent return you in peace,</b> and he said no more.
Rav Asi <b>came before Rabbi Elazar,</b> because he did not know how to interpret Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement. <b>He said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: <b>God forbid, perhaps</b> he <b>is angry</b> with me that I wished to leave? Rabbi Elazar <b>said to him: What</b> exactly <b>did he say to you?</b> Rav Asi <b>said to him:</b> May <b>the Omnipresent return you in peace.</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>said to him: If it is so that he was angry, he would not have blessed you.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan certainly gave you permission to leave. <b>In the meantime,</b> while he was traveling to meet her, Rav Asi <b>heard that her coffin was coming,</b> i.e., his mother had died and her coffin was being brought to Eretz Yisrael. <b>He said: Had I known I would not have left,</b> as after his mother’s death he was not obligated to leave Eretz Yisrael to honor her.
<b>The Sages taught: One honors</b> his father <b>in his life and honors him in his death. How</b> does he honor him <b>in his life? One who goes to a place on the command of his father should not say</b> to the people to whom he has been sent, to hurry them along: <b>Send me</b> on my journey <b>on my own behalf,</b> or: <b>Hurry up on my own behalf,</b> or: <b>Allow me</b> to <b>take leave</b> of this business <b>on my own behalf. Rather,</b> he should say <b>all</b> of the above in the following manner: Act in this manner <b>on Father’s behalf,</b> as a mark of respect for his father.
<b>How</b> does he honor him <b>in his death?</b> If <b>he says a matter he heard from his</b> father’s <b>mouth, he should not say: So said Father. Rather,</b> he should say: <b>So said Father, my teacher, may I be an atonement for his resting</b> soul. <b>And this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>applies within twelve months</b> of his death. <b>From this</b> time <b>onward he says: May his memory be for a blessing, for the life of the World-to-Come.</b>
<b>The Sages taught: A Sage</b> who lectures in public must <b>change the name of his father,</b> i.e., when he quotes his father he should not mention him by name. <b>And</b> similarly, he changes the <b>name of his teacher. The disseminator,</b> who explains the statements of a Sage to the audience, <b>changes neither the name of his father nor the name of his teacher.</b> The Gemara asks: To <b>whose father</b> is this referring? <b>If we say</b> it is referring to <b>the father of the disseminator,</b> whom the Sage mentioned in his lecture, <b>is that to say</b> that <b>the disseminator is not obligated</b> to observe the mitzva of honoring one’s father? How can a disseminator mention his own father by name?
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> This is referring to the <b>name of the Sage’s father and the name of the Sage’s teacher.</b> This is <b>like that which Mar bar Rav Ashi</b> would do, as <b>when he would teach</b> Torah <b>at his regular lecture</b> and would mention a <i>halakha</i> in the name of his father, Rav Ashi, <b>he would say:</b> So said <b>my father, my teacher; and his disseminator</b> would <b>say: So said Rav Ashi.</b> Although a son may not mention his father’s name, the disseminator of his lecture may do so.
<b>The Sages taught: What is fear and what is honor? Fear</b> of one’s father includes the following: <b>One may not stand in his</b> father’s fixed <b>place, and may not sit in his place, and may not contradict his statements</b> by expressing an opinion contrary to that of his father, <b>and he may not choose sides</b> when his father argues with someone else. What is considered <b>honor? He gives</b> his father <b>food and drink, dresses and covers</b> him, and <b>brings</b> him <b>in and takes</b> him <b>out</b> for all his household needs.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages:

Daf 32a

<b>From whose</b> funds must one give his father food and drink? <b>Rav Yehuda says: From</b> the money <b>of the son. Rav Natan bar Oshaya said: From</b> the money <b>of the father. The Sages gave</b> this following <b>ruling to Rav Yirmeya, and some say</b> they gave this following ruling <b>to the son of Rav Yirmeya:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is <b>like the one who says</b> it must be paid <b>from</b> the money <b>of the father.</b>
<b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>It is stated: “Honor your father and your mother”</b> (Exodus 20:11), <b>and it is stated: “Honor the Lord with your wealth”</b> (Proverbs 3:9), which teaches the following verbal analogy: <b>Just as there</b> one honors God “with your wealth,” i.e., <b>through monetary loss, so too here</b> one must honor his father <b>through monetary loss. And if you say</b> that one honors him <b>from</b> the money of <b>the father, what difference</b> does it make <b>to</b> the son, i.e., what monetary loss does he suffer? The Gemara answers: It makes a difference to him with regard <b>to</b> the <b>neglect of</b> his <b>work.</b> Although he is not required to spend his own money, the son must leave aside his work to honor his father, which will cause him some financial loss.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Two brothers,</b> or <b>two partners</b> in the ownership of produce, or <b>a father and son,</b> or <b>a rabbi and his student, may redeem</b> the <b>second tithe for each other</b> without adding one-fifth, as one who redeems the tithe of another, including these individuals, is not required to add one-fifth. <b>And they may feed each other</b> the <b>poor man’s tithe.</b> If one of them is poor, the other may give him the poor man’s tithe that he separated from his produce, and it is not considered as though the pauper ate the poor man’s tithe from his own produce.
The Gemara explains the proof from this <i>baraita</i>. <b>And if you say</b> that the obligation to honor one’s father is <b>from</b> the money <b>of the son,</b> one <b>finds</b> that <b>this</b> son <b>repays his obligation from</b> the produce <b>of the poor,</b> as he is taking care of his father with produce that should go to the poor. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary to</b> state this <i>halakha</i> in a case where he has covered all of his father’s basic needs with his own money. At this stage, if his father needs <b>surplus</b> money, he may give it to him from the poor man’s tithe.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> consider <b>that which is taught with regard to</b> this <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: May a curse come upon one who feeds his father</b> the <b>poor man’s tithe. And if</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that one may feed his father the poor man’s tithe, was said <b>with regard to a surplus, what difference is there?</b> Since the son has fulfilled his obligation and simply adds something so that his father will have more, why is this person cursed? The Gemara answers: <b>Even so, it is a disrespectful matter</b> for one to feed his father with money that has been designated as charity for the poor.
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: They asked Rabbi Eliezer how far</b> one must go in <b>honoring</b> his <b>father and mother.</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to them: Such that</b> the father <b>takes a purse and throw it into the sea in front of</b> his son, <b>and</b> the son <b>does not embarrass him. And if you say</b> that the son honors him <b>from</b> the money <b>of the father, what difference</b> does it make <b>to</b> the son? Why would the son care if his father throws away his own purse? The Gemara answers: This is referring <b>to</b> a son who is <b>fit to inherit</b> from <b>him.</b> Since the son thinks that the money will eventually belong to him, he has cause for anger.
<b>And this is as</b> reflected in an incident involving <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna, when Rav Huna tore silk garments in front of his son Rabba.</b> Rav Huna had <b>said</b> to himself: <b>I will go</b> and <b>see if he becomes angry or does not become angry,</b> i.e., he wanted to test him and see whether his son Rabba would honor him. The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> his son <b>would become angry</b> and Rav Huna would thereby <b>violate</b> the prohibition of: <b>“Nor put a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14), as by testing his son Rav Huna would have caused him to sin. The Gemara answers: It was a case <b>where</b> the father had <b>forgone his honor</b> from the outset. Consequently, even if the son grew angry with him, he would not have violated the mitzva.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> by tearing his clothes, <b>he violates the prohibition: Do not destroy</b> (see Deuteronomy 20:19). The Gemara answers <b>that</b> Rav Huna <b>made</b> a tear <b>at the seam,</b> so that the garment could be repaired. The Gemara asks: <b>Perhaps</b> it was <b>due to that</b> reason that <b>the son did not become angry,</b> because he saw that his father caused no actual damage? The Gemara answers: <b>He did this when</b> the son was already <b>angry</b> for some other reason, so that he would not notice this detail.
The Gemara cites another story involving the mitzva of honoring one’s father and mother. <b>Rav Yeḥezkel taught his son Rami:</b> If people sentenced to be <b>burned</b> became mingled <b>with</b> those sentenced to be <b>stoned Rabbi Shimon says:</b> All of them <b>are judged with</b> the punishment of <b>stoning, as the</b> punishment of <b>burning is more severe.</b> Since the death penalty of each is uncertain, all of them are treated leniently.
<b>Rav Yehuda,</b> who was also Rav Yeḥezkel’s <b>son, said to him: Father, do not teach</b> the mishna <b>this way,</b> as, according to this version, <b>why</b> is this the <i>halakha</i> <b>specifically</b> because <b>burning is more severe</b> than stoning? <b>Let him derive</b> it from the fact <b>that the majority are</b> sentenced to be <b>stoned.</b> The wording of the <i>baraita</i>, which states that those who were supposed to be burned became mixed up with those who were to be stoned, indicates that the people sentenced to stoning are the majority. If so, one should simply follow the majority. <b>Rather, I will teach it this</b> way: If those <b>who are</b> sentenced to be <b>stoned</b> became mixed up <b>with</b> those <b>who are</b> sentenced to be <b>burned,</b> they are all judged with the punishment of stoning even though this is the minority, as they are all treated leniently.
Rav Yeḥezkel <b>said to him: If so, say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>And the Rabbis say</b> that <b>they should be judged with</b> the punishment of <b>burning, as the</b> punishment of <b>stoning is more severe.</b> According to your version, <b>why</b> is this the <i>halakha</i> <b>specifically</b> because <b>stoning is more severe? Let him derive</b> it due to the fact <b>that the majority</b> of people <b>are</b> sentenced to be <b>burned,</b> and one follows the majority.
His son Rav Yehuda <b>said to him:</b> The statement of the Rabbis is not difficult, as <b>there the Rabbis are saying to Rabbi Shimon</b> as follows: <b>That which you said,</b> that <b>burning is more severe,</b> is <b>not</b> the case; rather, <b>stoning is more severe.</b> In other words, the Rabbis were specifically responding to Rabbi Shimon’s reasoning, and therefore they stated the opposite claim and ignored the issue of which group is in the majority.
Later, <b>Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda: Big-toothed</b> one, <b>do not speak to your father like that,</b> as it is disrespectful. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one’s father was transgressing a Torah matter, he should not say to him</b> explicitly: <b>Father, you transgressed a Torah matter. Rather, he should say to him: Father, so it is written in the Torah.</b> The Gemara asks: If he says to him directly: <b>This is</b> what is <b>written in the Torah, he will cause him suffering. Rather,</b> he should <b>say to him: Father, this verse is written in the Torah,</b> and he should proceed to quote the verse, from which his father will understand on his own that he has acted improperly.
§ <b>Elazar ben Matya says:</b> If my <b>father says: Give me water, and</b> there is <b>a mitzva</b> for me <b>to perform</b> at the same time, <b>I set aside the honor of my father and perform the mitzva, as my father and I are</b> both <b>obligated in the mitzva. Isi ben Yehuda says: If it is possible for</b> this <b>mitzva to be performed by others, let it be performed by others, and he should go</b> and attend <b>to the honor</b> due to <b>his father,</b> as the honor of his father is his obligation alone. <b>Rav Mattana says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> with regard to this matter <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Isi ben Yehuda.</b>
<b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Sheila says</b> that <b>Rav Mattana says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> With regard to <b>a father who forgoes his honor, his honor is forgone,</b> and his son does not transgress if he does not treat him in the proper manner. By contrast, with regard to <b>a rabbi who forgoes his honor, his honor is not forgone.</b>
<b>And Rav Yosef says: Even</b> with regard to <b>a rabbi who forgoes his honor, his honor is forgone, as it is stated: “And the Lord went before them by day”</b> (Exodus 13:21). God Himself, the Teacher of the Jewish people, had forgone the honor due Him and took the trouble to guide the people. <b>Rava said: How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> with regard to <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, the world is His and the Torah is His,</b> and therefore He can <b>forgo His honor.</b>

Daf 32b

By contrast, <b>here, is it his Torah,</b> that the teacher can forgo its honor? <b>Rava then said: Yes,</b> if he studies, <b>it is his Torah, as it is written:</b> “For his delight is the Torah of the Lord, <b>and in his Torah he meditates day and night”</b> (Psalms 1:2). This indicates that at first it is “the Torah of the Lord,” but after he studies, it becomes “his Torah.”
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But Rava served drinks</b> to the guests <b>at his son’s wedding celebration, and he poured a cup for Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, and they stood before him</b> when he approached them. When he poured a cup <b>for Rav Mari and</b> for <b>Rav Pineḥas, son of Rav Ḥisda, they did not stand before him.</b> Rava <b>became angry and said:</b> Are <b>these Sages,</b> i.e., Rav Mari and Rav Pineḥas, <b>Sages, and</b> are <b>those Sages,</b> who stood to honor me, <b>not Sages?</b> Do you think you are so great that you are not required to honor a Sage?
<b>And furthermore,</b> it happened that <b>Rav Pappa was serving drinks</b> to the guests <b>at the wedding celebration [<i>hillula</i>] of Abba Mar, his son, and he poured a cup for Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, and he did not stand before him, and</b> Rav Pappa <b>became angry.</b> These anecdotes indicate that even when a rabbi forgoes the honor due to him by serving drinks to his guests, his honor is not forgone. The Gemara answers: A rabbi can forgo the full measure of honor due to him, but <b>even so,</b> others are <b>required to perform</b> some act of <b>reverence,</b> such as preparing to stand before him.
<b>Rav Ashi said: Even according to the one who says</b> that if <b>a rabbi forgoes</b> the <b>honor</b> due <b>him, his honor is forgone,</b> if <b>a <i>Nasi</i> forgoes</b> the <b>honor</b> due <b>him, his honor is not forgone. The Gemara raises an objection:</b> There was <b>an incident involving Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Tzadok, who were reclining at the wedding of Rabban Gamliel’s son. And Rabban Gamliel,</b> who was <i>Nasi</i> of the Sanhedrin at the time, <b>was standing over them and serving them drinks. He gave the cup to Rabbi Eliezer and he would not accept it; he gave it to Rabbi Yehoshua and he accepted it. Rabbi Eliezer said to him: What is this, Yehoshua? We sit and the esteemed Rabban Gamliel stands over us and serves us drinks?</b>
Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: We found</b> one <b>greater than him who served</b> his guests, as our forefather <b>Abraham</b> was <b>greater than him and he served</b> his guests. <b>Abraham was the greatest</b> man <b>of</b> his <b>generation and it is written about him: “And he stood over them</b> under the tree, and they ate” (Genesis 18:8). <b>And lest you say:</b> His guests <b>appeared to him as ministering angels,</b> and that is why he honored them, in fact <b>they appeared to him only as Arabs. And</b> if so, <b>should not the esteemed Rabban Gamliel stand over us and serve us drinks?</b>
<b>Rabbi Tzadok said to them: For how long will you ignore the honor</b> due <b>to the Omnipresent, and deal with the honor of people?</b> You could cite a proof from God Himself. After all, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, makes</b> the <b>winds blow, and raises</b> the <b>clouds, and brings</b> the <b>rain, and causes</b> the <b>earth to sprout, and sets a table before each and every</b> creature. <b>And should not the esteemed Rabban Gamliel stand over us and serve us drinks?</b> This discussion indicates that even a <i>Nasi</i> may forgo the honor due him.
<b>Rather, if it was stated, it was stated as follows: Rav Ashi said: Even according to the one who says</b> that if <b>a <i>Nasi</i> forgoes</b> the <b>honor</b> due <b>him, his honor is forgone,</b> if <b>a king forgoes</b> the <b>honor</b> due <b>him, his honor is not forgone. As it is stated: “You shall set a king over you”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:15), which indicates <b>that his fear should be upon you.</b> The people are commanded to fear a king, and therefore it is not permitted for him to forgo the honor due to him.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“Before the hoary head you shall stand</b> and you shall revere the face of an elder, and you shall fear your God” (Leviticus 19:32): One <b>might</b> have thought that it is obligatory to stand <b>before a simple [<i>ashmai</i>] elder.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “elder,” and an “elder”</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>a wise man, as it is stated: “Gather unto Me seventy men of the Elders of Israel,</b> whom you know to be the Elders of the people” (Numbers 11:16). <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: An “elder [<i>zaken</i>]”</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>one who has acquired wisdom.</b> He interprets the word <i>zaken</i> as a contraction of the phrase <i>zeh kanna</i>, meaning: This one has acquired. Elsewhere the word <i>kanna</i> is used in reference to wisdom, <b>as it is stated</b> that wisdom says: <b>“The Lord acquired me [<i>kanani</i>] at the beginning of His way”</b> (Proverbs 8:22).
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one must stand before</b> an elder as soon as he sees him, even <b>from a distance.</b> Therefore <b>the verse states: “You shall stand and you shall revere”</b> (Leviticus 19:32), which teaches: <b>I said</b> that one is obligated to <b>stand only in a place where there is reverence.</b> If he stands while the elder is still far away, it is not clear that he is doing so in his honor.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he should revere him through money,</b> i.e., that one is required to give an elder money in his honor. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall stand and you shall revere.” Just as standing includes no monetary loss, so too, reverence</b> is referring to an action <b>that includes no monetary loss.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one should</b> also <b>stand before him in the lavatory or in the bathhouse.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall stand and you shall revere,”</b> which indicates: <b>I said</b> the mitzva of <b>standing only in a place where there is reverence.</b> It is inappropriate to show respect for someone in places of this kind.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one may close his eyes like one who does not see</b> the elder. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Before the hoary head <b>you shall stand</b> and you shall revere the face of an elder, <b>and you shall fear</b> your God” (Leviticus 19:32). <b>With regard to</b> any <b>matter given over to the heart, it is stated: “And you shall fear your God.”</b> This phrase is referring to a situation where it is impossible to prove whether one purposefully made it appear as if he were not aware that he was obligated to perform a mitzva, as only that individual and God know the truth.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: From where</b> is it derived that <b>an elder should not trouble</b> others to honor him? <b>The verse states:</b> “And you shall revere the face of <b>an elder, and you shall fear</b> your God.” The phrase “an elder, and you shall fear,” read by itself, without the rest of the verse, indicates that an elder is also commanded to fear God, and not purposefully act in a manner to cause others to have to honor him. In conclusion, the <i>baraita</i> cites another opinion. <b>Isi ben Yehuda says</b> that the verse: <b>“Before the hoary head you shall stand,”</b> indicates that <b>even any</b> person of <b>hoary head is included</b> in this mitzva, not only a Sage.
The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>. Apparently the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili is</b> the same as that of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> as they both say that an elder is a Torah scholar. What does Rabbi Yosei HaGelili add? The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a difference <b>between them</b> with regard to one who is <b>young and wise. The first <i>tanna</i> maintains:</b> One who is <b>young and wise</b> is <b>not</b> considered an elder, as the mitzva applies only to one who is both elderly and wise. <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili maintains:</b> It is <b>even</b> a mitzva to honor one who is <b>young and wise.</b> According to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, the mitzva is not referring to old age at all, but only to wisdom.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili? He</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>if enters your mind</b> to explain <b>as the first <i>tanna</i> says,</b> that for the obligation to honor another be in effect that person must be both elderly and wise, <b>if so, let the Merciful One write: Before the hoary head of an elder you shall stand and you shall revere. What is the difference</b> between the two terms “hoary head” and “elder,” <b>that the Merciful One separates them?</b> This serves <b>to say that this</b> term <b>is not</b> the same as <b>that</b> one, <b>and that</b> term <b>is not</b> the same as <b>this</b> one, i.e., an elder is not required to have a hoary head. <b>Learn from</b> the verse that <b>even</b> one who is <b>young and wise</b> is called an elder.
<b>And the first <i>tanna</i></b> would say that the verse is written this way <b>because</b> the Torah <b>wants to juxtapose “elder”</b> with <b>“and you shall fear,”</b> in accordance with Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar’s statement above that an elder should not trouble others to honor him. The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reasoning of the first <i>tanna</i>?</b> Why does he maintain that one is obligated to stand only before an elder, wise man? The Gemara answers: The first <i>tanna</i> maintains that <b>if it enters your mind</b> to explain <b>as Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says, let the Merciful One write:</b>

Daf 33a

<b>Before the hoary head of an elder you shall stand and revere; you shall stand and revere the face of an elder. From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the Merciful One <b>did not write this</b> and thereby divide the two concepts, <b>learn from it</b> that “elder” and “hoary head” are together referring to <b>one</b> type of person.
<b>The Master said</b> previously in the <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he should revere him through money,</b> i.e., he is required to give him money in his honor; therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall stand and you shall revere”</b> (Leviticus 19:32). <b>Just as standing includes no monetary loss, so too, reverence</b> is referring to an action <b>that includes no monetary loss.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does <b>standing include no monetary loss</b> at all? <b>Are we not dealing</b> with a case <b>where he was piercing pearls,</b> a highly remunerative task, <b>and in the meantime he must stand</b> for the elder <b>and</b> thereby <b>neglect his work,</b> which causes him a loss?
<b>Rather,</b> the verse <b>juxtaposes standing to reverence: Just as reverence does not include neglect</b> of work, <b>so too, standing does not include neglect</b> of work; therefore, one who is engaged in work is not obligated to stand before an elder. <b>And</b> the verse <b>also juxtaposes reverence to standing: Just as standing includes no monetary loss,</b> as standing applies only when it does not entail neglect of work, as explained previously, <b>so too, reverence</b> is referring to an action <b>that includes no monetary loss. From here</b> the Sages <b>stated: Craftsmen are not permitted to stand before Torah scholars when they are engaged in their work.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> are craftsmen <b>not</b> required to stand before Torah scholars? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 3:3): When farmers bring their first fruits to Jerusalem, <b>all craftsmen stand before them, and greet them, and say to them: Our brothers from such and such a place, welcome!</b> Since craftsmen would stand even for those engaged in a mitzva, all the more so should they stand for Torah scholars. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> There is no difficulty here, as indeed <b>they stood before</b> those bringing first fruits, and yet <b>they would not stand before Torah scholars.</b>
Based on this <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Avin says: Come and see how beloved is a mitzva</b> performed <b>in its</b> proper <b>time, as</b> the craftsmen <b>stood before those</b> who were fulfilling a mitzva, whereas <b>they did not stand before Torah scholars.</b> The Gemara responds: This does not prove that the same applies to all mitzvot performed in their proper times, as <b>perhaps it is different there,</b> with regard to the bringing of the first fruits; for <b>if so,</b> i.e., if one does not treat those who bring first fruits with such honor, they will not want to come at all, <b>and you will cause them to stumble</b> and sin <b>in the future.</b> Consequently, the Sages instituted that those bringing first fruits should be treated with special honor. This reasoning does not apply to people performing other mitzvot.
<b>The Master said</b> previously: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one should</b> also <b>stand before</b> an Elder <b>in the lavatory or in the bathhouse;</b> therefore, the verse said: “You shall stand and you shall revere,” which indicates that the mitzva of standing applies only in a place where there is reverence. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does one <b>not</b> show honor in a lavatory? <b>But Rabbi Ḥiyya was sitting</b> in <b>a bathhouse and Rabbi Shimon bar Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>passed by, and he did not stand before him. And</b> Rabbi Shimon bar Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>became angry and went and said to his father,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>I taught</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>two</b> of the <b>five</b> parts <b>of the book of Psalms, and</b> yet <b>he did not stand before me.</b> This indicates that a display of honor is appropriate even in a bathhouse.
<b>And furthermore, bar Kappara, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rabbi Yosei, was sitting in a bathhouse. Rabbi Shimon bar Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>entered and passed by, and he did not stand before him.</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>became angry and went and said to his father: I taught him two</b> of the <b>nine</b> parts <b>of <i>Torat Kohanim</i>,</b> the halakhic midrash on Leviticus, <b>and</b> yet <b>he did not stand before me. And</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Shimon: <b>Perhaps he was sitting and contemplating</b> what you taught him and did not see you come in.
The Gemara explains the proof: The fact that <b>the reason</b> he might have been exempt was <b>that he was sitting and pondering</b> the lessons indicates that <b>if that were not so,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi would <b>not</b> have justified such behavior. One must stand before a Sage even in a bathhouse.
The Gemara answers that this is <b>not difficult: This</b> <i>halakha</i>, that one is not required to stand in a bathhouse, applies <b>to the inner rooms,</b> where everyone is naked; standing in a place of this kind certainly does not bestow honor. <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i>, that one is obligated to stand in a bathhouse, applies <b>to the outer rooms,</b> where people are still dressed. Standing is a sign of respect in these rooms.
The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> that this is the correct explanation, <b>as Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: One is permitted to contemplate</b> matters of Torah <b>everywhere, except for the bathhouse and the lavatory.</b> Since Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi suggested that the student might have been sitting and pondering his studies, it can be assumed that the episode occurred in a location where only some of the <i>halakhot</i> governing one’s behavior in a bathhouse apply, i.e., the outer rooms. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Perhaps one</b> whose studies are <b>beyond his control is different;</b> it is possible he was so absorbed in Torah study that he forgot that he was in a place where it is prohibited to think about sacred matters.
It is taught in the same <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one may close his eyes like one who does not see</b> the elder; therefore, the verse states: “Before the hoary head you shall stand, and you shall revere the face of an elder, and you shall fear your God” (Leviticus 19:32). The Gemara expresses surprise at this statement: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>we are dealing with wicked people</b> who would intentionally act this way to avoid fulfilling a mitzva?
<b>Rather,</b> this means: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one may close his eyes before the obligation</b> to stand <b>arrives,</b> i.e., when the elder is still far off. This would mean <b>that when the obligation</b> does <b>arrive he will not see him,</b> such <b>that</b> he would be required <b>to stand before him.</b> In this manner he thinks that he can avoid the obligation altogether. Therefore <b>the verse states: “You shall stand…and you shall fear,”</b> i.e., one should fear He who knows the secrets of one’s heart.
§ A Sage <b>taught: What is</b> the type of <b>standing that indicates reverence? You must say</b> that this applies when it is clear that one is standing in the elder’s honor, which is within <b>four cubits</b> of him. <b>Abaye said: We said</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that one must stand within four cubits of the elder, <b>only with regard to</b> one <b>who is not his primary teacher; but for his primary teacher</b> he must stand when he is <b>within his range of vision,</b> i.e., as soon as he sees him, even if he is more than four cubits away.
The Gemara likewise reports that <b>Abaye would stand as soon as he saw the ear of Rav Yosef’s donkey coming</b> toward him. The Gemara relates: <b>Abaye was riding a donkey along the bank of the Sagya River. Rav Mesharshiyya and</b> other <b>rabbis were sitting on the other bank</b> of the river, <b>and they did not stand before him.</b> Abaye <b>said to them: Am I not</b> your <b>primary teacher?</b> You are therefore required to stand before me, despite the fact that I am far away. <b>They said to him: That</b> did <b>not</b> enter <b>our minds,</b> i.e., we did not see you at all.
§ It was further stated in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: From where</b> is it derived that <b>an elder should not trouble</b> others to honor him? <b>The verse states:</b> “And you shall revere the face of <b>an elder, and you shall fear</b> your God.” <b>Abaye said: We have a tradition that if</b> a Sage <b>circumnavigates</b> an area so that people will not have to stand before him, he <b>will live</b> a long life. The Gemara relates that <b>Abaye</b> would <b>circumnavigate</b> an area, and likewise <b>Rabbi Zeira</b> would <b>circumnavigate</b> an area.
The Gemara cites another incident involving honor one demonstrates for his teacher. Once, when <b>Ravina was sitting before Rabbi Yirmeya of Difti, a certain man passed before him and did not cover his head.</b> Ravina <b>said: How rude is this man,</b> who does not show respect by covering his head in honor of a rabbi. Rabbi Yirmeya of Difti <b>said to him: Perhaps he is from</b> the city of <b>Mata Meḥasya, where rabbis are common</b> and the people living there are consequently not as careful to display honor as those in other places.
§ It was stated previously that <b>Isi ben Yehuda says</b> that as the verse states: <b>“Before the hoary head you shall stand,”</b> it indicates that <b>even anyone of hoary head is included,</b> not only a Torah scholar. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Isi ben Yehuda.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> himself <b>would stand before Aramean,</b> i.e., gentile, <b>elders. He said: How many experiences [<i>harpatkei</i>] have occurred to these</b> individuals. It is appropriate to honor them, due to the wisdom they have garnered from their long lives. <b>Rava would not stand before them,</b> but <b>he displayed reverence to them.</b>
<b>Abaye would extend a hand to elders</b> so that they could lean on him. <b>Rava would send his agent</b> to help them. <b>Rav Naḥman would send officers [<i>goza’ei</i>],</b> his servants, to assist elders. <b>He said: If not for the Torah, how many</b> people named <b>Naḥman bar Abba would there be in the marketplace?</b> In other words, I am not permitted to treat my Torah study lightly by assisting them myself, as I can perform this mitzva through others.
<b>Rabbi Aivu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yannai says:</b>

Daf 33b

<b>A Torah scholar is permitted to stand before his teacher only</b> once <b>in the morning and</b> once in the <b>evening, so that</b> the teacher’s <b>honor should not be greater than the honor of Heaven,</b> as one recites the <i>Shema</i>, which is tantamount to greeting God, once in the morning and once in the evening. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from an aforementioned opinion. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: From where</b> is it derived that <b>an elder should not trouble</b> others to honor him? <b>The verse states: “An elder, and you shall fear”</b> (Leviticus 19:32). The collocation of these words comes to teach that the elder, too, must fear God.
The Gemara explains the objection: <b>And if you say</b> one may stand <b>only</b> in the <b>morning and evening, why</b> does the <i>baraita</i> say an elder <b>should not trouble</b> others? Standing for an elder only twice a day <b>is an obligation</b> for the people, not an imposition. <b>Rather,</b> is it <b>not</b> correct to say <b>that</b> one is obligated to stand before one’s teacher at <b>any</b> point <b>during the day?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No; actually</b> one is obligated to stand <b>only</b> in <b>the morning and evening, and even so, as much as it is possible for</b> the elder, <b>he should not trouble</b> the people to stand.
§ <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Any Torah scholar who does not stand before his teacher is called wicked, and he will not live a long life, and his studies will be forgotten, as it is stated: “But it shall not be well for the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow, because he does not fear before [<i>millifnei</i>] God”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:13). <b>This fear</b> mentioned in the verse, <b>I do not know what it is. When</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “And you shall revere the face [<i>penei</i>] of an elder, <b>and you shall fear your God”</b> (Leviticus 19:32), one can deduce <b>that this fear</b> mentioned in the verse <b>is</b> referring to <b>standing.</b> Consequently, this verse teaches with regard to one who does not stand that he is called wicked, he will not live a long life, and his studies will be forgotten, as indicated by the phrase: “It shall not be well.”
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that this is referring to <b>fear of</b> God stated with regard to <b>interest</b> (Leviticus 25:36), <b>or</b> the <b>fear of</b> God stated with regard to <b>weights</b> (Deuteronomy 25:13–16), as the fear of God is mentioned with regard to these prohibitions as well. The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Elazar derives</b> this <i>halakha</i> through a verbal analogy of <b>“<i>penei</i>” and “<i>penei</i>,”</b> as explained previously, not from a verbal analogy of the term “fear.”
<b>A dilemma was raised before them:</b> With regard to one who is both a man’s <b>son and his teacher, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> as to whether that son must <b>stand before his father?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda: Big-toothed</b> one, <b>stand before your father.</b> Although Rav Yehuda was a great Torah scholar and taught his father, he was still required to stand before him. The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Yeḥezkel,</b> Rav Yehuda’s father, <b>is different, as he was a man of</b> good <b>deeds,</b> and <b>even Mar Shmuel</b> himself <b>would stand before him.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, what is</b> Shmuel <b>saying</b> to Rav Yehuda? If he is not teaching him that one who is his father’s teacher must stand before his father, why did Shmuel say this to Rav Yehuda? The Gemara answers that <b>this is what</b> Shmuel <b>said to him: Sometimes</b> your father <b>comes from behind me</b> and I do not see him or stand before him. Nevertheless, <b>you should stand before him and do not be concerned about my honor.</b>
Another <b>dilemma was raised before them,</b> with regard to one who is both a man’s <b>son and his teacher, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> as <b>to</b> whether <b>the father</b> must <b>stand before</b> his son? The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: It is not appropriate for me to stand before my son</b> solely due to his greatness in Torah, as I am greater than him. <b>But due to the honor of the household of the <i>Nasi</i></b> I do stand before him, as his son was a son-in-law of the <i>Nasi</i>.
It may be inferred from here that if his son were not in the household of the <i>Nasi</i> he would not stand for him, and <b>the reason</b> was <b>that</b> he could claim: <b>I am his teacher</b> and therefore I am not obligated to stand before him. Accordingly, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi is indicating that if <b>he were my teacher I would stand before him.</b> The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>This is what</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>is saying: It is not appropriate for me to stand before my son, even</b> if <b>he</b> were <b>my teacher, as I am his father. But due to the honor of the household of the <i>Nasi</i></b> I do stand before him.
<b>A dilemma was raised before them:</b> If one’s teacher is <b>riding</b> on an animal, is that considered <b>like walking,</b> and therefore one must stand before him, <b>or</b> is he <b>not</b> obligated to stand before him, since he is stationary relative to the animal? <b>Abaye said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from a different issue (<i>Nega’im</i> 13:7): If a leper, who is <b>ritually impure</b> and transfers impurity through a tent, i.e., anyone who enters the location of the leper is rendered impure, <b>is sitting under</b> the branches of <b>a tree,</b> which form a tent over him, <b>and a pure</b> person <b>is standing</b> under that tree, the pure person is rendered <b>impure.</b>
If the <b>impure</b> person <b>is standing under the tree and the pure</b> person <b>is sitting</b> there, he remains <b>pure.</b> In this case, as the impure person is not settled there, he does not impart ritual impurity in a tent. <b>But if the impure</b> person <b>sat</b> and established his place there, <b>the pure</b> individual is rendered <b>impure.</b>
That mishna adds: <b>And the same</b> <i>halakha</i> applies <b>with regard to a stone afflicted</b> with a leprous <b>sore</b> (see Leviticus, chapter 14), which also imparts impurity of a tent. If one carrying a stone of this kind sits under a tree, a pure person standing under the tree is rendered impure, whereas if the person carrying the stone stands, he does not render the other individual impure. <b>And Rav Naḥman bar Kohen says: That is to say</b> that <b>riding is</b> considered <b>like walking,</b> as although the stone is stationary relative to the person, it is considered to be moving. <b>Conclude from it</b> that in all cases riding is like walking.
<b>A dilemma was raised before them: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> as <b>to</b> whether one should <b>stand before a Torah scroll? Rabbi Ḥilkiya and Rabbi Simon and Rabbi Elazar say</b> that this dilemma can be resolved by <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: If <b>one stands before those who study</b> the Torah, is it <b>not all the more so</b> true that one should stand <b>before</b> the Torah itself?
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Elai and Rabbi Ya’akov bar Zavdi were sitting</b> and studying Torah. <b>Rabbi Shimon bar Abba passed before them and they stood before him.</b> Rabbi Shimon bar Abba <b>said to them:</b> You are not obligated to do this, for two reasons. <b>One</b> reason is <b>that that you are</b> ordained <b>scholars and I</b> am only <b>an associate,</b> i.e., he had not been ordained. <b>And furthermore, does the Torah stand before those who study it?</b> Since you are engaged in Torah study at the present moment you are not required to stand before a Torah scholar.
The Gemara comments: Rabbi Shimon bar Abba <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar says: A Torah scholar may not stand before his teacher when he is studying Torah,</b> because he is engaged in honoring the Torah itself. The Gemara adds: Even so, <b>Abaye cursed</b> anyone who acted in accordance with this ruling, as he would give the appearance of one who disrespected his teacher.
§ The Gemara continues to discuss the mitzva of standing before a Torah scholar. With regard to the verse: <b>“And they looked after Moses until he was gone into the tent”</b> (Exodus 33:8), <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa</b> disputed its correct interpretation. <b>One said</b> that this is stated <b>unfavorably, and one said</b> that it is meant <b>favorably. The one who said</b> it was stated <b>unfavorably</b> explains the verse <b>as it is</b> interpreted in the midrash. <b>The one who said</b> it was stated <b>favorably</b> interprets the verse in accordance with that which <b>Ḥizkiyya says.</b>
As Ḥizkiyya says: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina, son of Rabbi Abbahu, said to me</b> that <b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Avdimi of Haifa says:</b> If a Torah <b>scholar</b> is <b>passing, one stands before him</b> if he passes within <b>four cubits</b> of him, <b>and once he passes four cubits</b> from him <b>he sits.</b> If the <b>president of the court</b> is <b>passing, one stands before him</b> as soon as he comes <b>within his range of vision. And once he passes four cubits</b> from him, <b>he sits.</b> If the <b><i>Nasi</i></b> is <b>passing, one stands before him</b> as soon as he comes <b>within his range of vision, and he does not sit until</b> the <i>Nasi</i> <b>sits in his place, as it is stated: “And they looked after Moses until he was gone into the tent,”</b> and only afterward did they sit. According to this interpretation, the verse is praising the behavior of the Jews.
§ The mishna teaches that women are exempt from <b>all positive, time-bound mitzvot. The Sages taught: What is a positive, time-bound mitzva?</b> Examples include residing in <b>a <i>sukka</i>, and</b> taking the <b><i>lulav</i>,</b> and blowing the <b>shofar</b> on Rosh HaShana, all of which can be performed only at specific times of the year. <b>And</b> another example is donning <b>ritual fringes,</b> as the mitzva applies only during the daytime due to the verse which states: “Fringes, that you may look upon them” (Numbers 15:39), indicating that the fringes should be seen.

Daf 34a

<b>And</b> the donning of <b>phylacteries</b> (Deuteronomy 6:8), which are not worn at night or on Shabbat and Festivals, is also a positive, time-bound mitzva.
<b>And what is a positive mitzva that is not time bound?</b> Examples include the affixing of <b>a <i>mezuza</i></b> (Deuteronomy 11:20), the construction of <b>a parapet</b> on a roof (Deuteronomy 22:8), returning <b>a lost item</b> (Deuteronomy 22:1–3), <b>and the release</b> of the mother bird from <b>the nest,</b> i.e., the mitzva of sending away a mother bird when one finds it sitting on chicks or eggs (Deuteronomy 22:6–7).
The Gemara asks: <b>But is</b> this an established <b>principle?</b> But <b>there are</b> the mitzvot of eating <b><i>matza</i></b> on the first night of Passover (Exodus 23:15), of <b>rejoicing</b> on a Festival (Deuteronomy 16:9–11), and <b>assembly</b> on <i>Sukkot</i> following the Sabbatical Year (Deuteronomy 31:10–13). <b>And</b> each of these is <b>a positive, time-bound mitzva, and</b> yet <b>women are obligated</b> in them. <b>And furthermore,</b> one can raise a difficulty as follows: <b>But there are</b> the mitzvot of <b>Torah study</b> (Deuteronomy 6:7), <b>procreation</b> (Genesis 1:28), <b>and redemption of the firstborn</b> (Exodus 13:12–13), each of which <b>is not a positive, time-bound mitzva, and</b> yet <b>women are exempt</b> from them.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: One does not learn</b> practical <i>halakhot</i> <b>from general statements,</b> i.e., when a general statement appears in a mishna and uses the term: All, it is not to be understood as an all-inclusive statement without exceptions. This is the case <b>even in a place where it says: Except,</b> to exclude a specific matter.
A proof for this is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Eiruvin</i> 26b): <b>One can establish a joining</b> of houses in courtyards [<i>eiruv ḥatzerot</i>] and a joining of Shabbat boundaries [<i>eiruv teḥumin</i>], <b>and</b> similarly, <b>one can merge</b> courtyards to permit carrying in a joint alleyway on Shabbat. This can be done <b>with all</b> types of food <b>except for water and salt.</b> This is stated as a <i>halakha</i> with specific exceptions, <b>and</b> yet one can ask: <b>Is there nothing else</b> that cannot be used for an <i>eiruv</i>? <b>But there are truffles and mushrooms,</b> which also cannot be used for an <i>eiruv</i>, because they do not offer nourishment. <b>Rather, conclude from this</b> that <b>one may not learn from general statements, even in a place where it says: Except.</b>
§ The Gemara turns to the sources of this principle. <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>women are exempt from positive, time-bound mitzvot?</b> It is <b>derived</b> by juxtaposition <b>from</b> the mitzva of <b>phylacteries: Just as women are exempt from</b> donning <b>phylacteries, so too, women are exempt from all positive, time-bound mitzvot. And</b> the exemption of women from donning <b>phylacteries is derived from</b> their exemption from <b>Torah study: Just as women are exempt from Torah study,</b> as derived from Deuteronomy 11:19, <b>so too women are exempt from</b> donning <b>phylacteries,</b> as the two issues are juxtaposed in the Torah (Deuteronomy 6:7–8).
The Gemara asks: <b>And let us</b> say the opposite <b>and juxtapose phylacteries to <i>mezuza</i>,</b> which is also mentioned in that passage. <i>Mezuza</i> is a mitzva in which women are also obligated. Based on this comparison, women would be obligated in phylacteries as well. The Gemara answers: <b>Phylacteries are juxtaposed to Torah study</b> in <b>both the first paragraph and in the second paragraph</b> of <i>Shema</i>, whereas <b>phylacteries are not juxtaposed to <i>mezuza</i> in the second paragraph.</b> It is therefore preferable to compare phylacteries to Torah study.
The Gemara says: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let us juxtapose <i>mezuza</i> to Torah study</b> and say that women are also exempt from the obligation of a <i>mezuza</i>. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: This <b>could not enter your mind, as it is written</b> with regard to the mitzva of <i>mezuza</i>: <b>“That your days may be multiplied”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:21). Can it be said that <b>men need life</b> but <b>women do not need life?</b> Since the reward for the performance of the mitzva of <i>mezuza</i> is extended life, this mitzva applies to women as well.
The Gemara further asks: <b>But there is</b> the mitzva of residing in <b>a <i>sukka</i>, which is a positive, time-bound mitzva, as it is written: “In <i>sukkot</i> you shall reside seven days”</b> (Leviticus 23:42), referring to seven specific days of the year. Nevertheless, <b>the reason</b> women are exempt from this mitzva is <b>that the Merciful One writes</b> in the continuation of the verse: “All <b>the homeborn</b> in Israel shall reside in <i>sukkot</i>.” The definite article “the” is an exclusion, and serves <b>to exclude the women</b> from the obligation to reside in a <i>sukka</i>. It may be derived from here that <b>if that was not so, women</b> would be <b>obligated.</b> This indicates that women do not receive a blanket exemption from every positive, time-bound mitzva.
<b>Abaye said:</b> In the case of residing in a <i>sukka</i> a special verse <b>was necessary</b> to exempt women, as otherwise <b>it might enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written:</b> “In <i>sukkot</i> you shall reside,” this means that you should <b>reside as you dwell</b> in your permanent home: <b>Just as a man and his wife</b> live together in <b>a residence, so too, a man and his wife</b> are obligated to reside together in a <b><i>sukka</i>.</b>
<b>And Rava said:</b>

Daf 34b

It is <b>necessary</b> to state this verse for another reason, as <b>it might enter your mind to say: Derive</b> a verbal analogy with regard to <i>Sukkot</i>, where the verse states: “On the <b>fifteenth</b> day of this seventh month is the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>” (Leviticus 23:34), <b>from</b> Passover, where the verse states: “And on the <b>fifteenth</b> day of the same month is the <b>festival of Passover”</b> (Leviticus 23:6). One would then say that <b>just as there women are obligated</b> to eat <i>matza</i> on the first night of Passover, despite the fact that it is a time-bound mitzva, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the mitzva of residing in the <i>sukka</i>, <b>women are obligated.</b> Therefore it <b>was necessary</b> for the verse to use the term “the homeborn” to exclude women from the obligation to reside in a <i>sukka</i>.
The Gemara further asks: <b>But there is</b> the mitzva of <b>appearance,</b> i.e., the obligation to bring a burnt-offering on pilgrimage Festivals, <b>which is a positive, time-bound mitzva. And the reason</b> women are exempt from this obligation is <b>that the Merciful One writes,</b> with regard to this mitzva: “Three times in the year all of <b>your males</b> shall appear before the Lord God” (Exodus 23:17), which serves <b>to exclude women.</b> It may be derived from here that <b>if that were not so, women</b> would be <b>obligated.</b> This indicates that women are not necessarily exempt from every positive, time-bound mitzva.
The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary</b> for the verse to teach the <i>halakha</i> in this case as well, as <b>it might enter your mind to say: Derive</b> a verbal analogy with regard to <b>appearance,</b> where the verse states: Three times in the year all of your males shall appear,” <b>from</b> the <b>appearance</b> stated with regard to the mitzva of <b>assembly,</b> about which the verse states: “When all of Israel come to appear before the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 31:11). One would then say that just as women are obligated in the mitzva of assembly, so too they should be obligated to appear on a pilgrimage Festival. It is therefore necessary for the Torah to state explicitly that women are exempt from the mitzva of appearance on a pilgrimage Festival.
With regard to the primary proof for the principle that women are exempt from positive, time-bound mitzvot, the Gemara asks: <b>But before deriving</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from phylacteries, to exempt</b> women from all positive, time-bound mitzvot, <b>derive</b> it <b>from</b> the mitzva of <b>rejoicing</b> on a Festival, in which women are obligated, <b>to obligate</b> women in all these mitzvot. <b>Abaye said:</b> The mitzva of rejoicing does not apply directly to women. Rather, <b>a woman is rendered joyful by her husband,</b> i.e., the mitzva is for him to gladden her on a Festival.
The Gemara asks: <b>What can be said</b> with regard to <b>a widow,</b> who no longer has a husband but is nevertheless obligated to be joyful on a Festival, as it is written: “And you shall rejoice before the Lord your God, you…and the widow” (Deuteronomy 16:11)? The Gemara answers that the mitzva does not apply directly to a widow; rather, it applies <b>to</b> the men <b>with whom she is present,</b> i.e., they have an obligation to ensure that widows rejoice on the Festivals.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>derive</b> that women are obligated in all positive, time-bound mitzvot <b>from</b> the mitzva of <b>assembly,</b> in which women are explicitly obligated despite the fact that it is a time-bound mitzva. The Gemara answers: One cannot derive in this manner, <b>because</b> the verses concerning <b><i>matza</i> and assembly are two verses that come as one,</b> i.e., to teach the same matter, that women are obligated in these mitzvot despite the fact that these are positive, time-bound mitzvot. <b>And</b> there is a principle that <b>any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> a precedent that applies to other cases. Rather, the two instances are considered exceptions.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> the verses concerning <b>phylacteries and appearance</b> are <b>also two verses that come as one,</b> as they both indicate that women are exempt from positive, time-bound mitzvot, <b>and</b> therefore the verses do <b>not teach</b> a precedent. The Gemara answers: These are not considered as two verses that come as one, as both <b>are necessary,</b> each for its own reason. <b>As, if the Merciful One had written</b> that women are exempt from donning <b>phylacteries and had not written</b> that they are exempt from the mitzva of <b>appearance, I would say: Derive</b> a verbal analogy to obligate women from the verse stated with regard to <b>appearance from</b> the <b>appearance</b> stated with regard to the mitzva of <b>assembly.</b> Therefore, it is necessary for the Torah to teach that women are exempt from the mitzva of appearance.
<b>And if the Merciful One had written</b> that women are exempt from <b>appearance, and had not written</b> that they are exempt from donning <b>phylacteries, I would say: I will compare phylacteries to <i>mezuza</i>,</b> which would mean that women are obligated in the mitzva of phylacteries. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> for both phylacteries and appearance, and they are not two verses that come as one.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> the verses concerning <b><i>matza</i> and assembly</b> are <b>also necessary,</b> each for its own reason, and they are not two verses that come as one either. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>For what</b> purpose are both of them <b>necessary? Granted, if the Merciful One had written</b> that women are obligated in the mitzva of <b>assembly but had not written</b> that they are obligated in eating <b><i>matza</i>, I would say: Derive</b> a verbal analogy with regard to Passover, where the verse states: “And on the <b>fifteenth</b> day of the same month is the festival of Passover” (Leviticus 23:6), from <i>Sukkot</i>, where the verse states: “On the <b>fifteenth</b> day of this seventh month is the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>” (Leviticus 23:34), teaching that women are exempt from eating <i>matza</i>, just as they are exempt from residing in a <i>sukka</i>. Therefore, it is necessary for a verse to teach that women are obligated in eating <i>matza</i>.
<b>But let the Merciful One write</b> that women are obligated in eating <b><i>matza</i>, and it</b> would <b>not</b> be <b>necessary</b> to state the same <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>assembly, and I</b> would <b>say</b> on my own: If <b>children are obligated</b> in assembly, as is stated explicitly in the verse “Assemble the people, the men and the women and the children” (Deuteronomy 31:12), are <b>women not all the more so</b> obligated? <b>Therefore,</b> as it is explicitly stated that women are obligated in assembly, the verses concerning <i>matza</i> and assembly are <b>two verses that come as one, and</b> consequently do <b>not teach</b> a precedent.
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> as a principle that two verses that come as one <b>do not teach</b> a precedent. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that two verses that come as one <b>do teach</b> a precedent, <b>what can be said?</b>
<b>And furthermore,</b> one can ask: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>women are obligated in positive mitzvot that are not time bound?</b> The Gemara answers <b>that</b> one <b>derives</b> this <b>from</b> the mitzva of <b>fearing</b> one’s mother and father: <b>Just as women are obligated</b> in the mitzva of <b>fear</b> (Leviticus 19:3), <b>so too, women are obligated in every positive mitzva that is not time bound.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>derive</b> the opposite <b>from Torah study:</b> Just as women are exempt from Torah study, so too they should be exempt from all positive mitzvot that are not time bound. The Gemara answers: One cannot derive an exemption for women from their exemption from Torah study, <b>because Torah study and procreation are two verses that come as one,</b> as in both cases women are exempt, despite the fact that these are not time-bound mitzvot. <b>And any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> a precedent.

Daf 35a

The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, who says</b> that <b>with regard to both of them,</b> men and women, the verse <b>states: “And God blessed them,</b> and God said to them: <b>Be fruitful and multiply,</b> replenish the earth and conquer it” (Genesis 1:28), <b>what can be said?</b> According to his opinion, women are exempt from only one positive mitzva that is not time bound, Torah study; why not derive other mitzvot from this case? The Gemara answers: The reason this is not a difficulty is <b>because Torah study and the redemption of the firstborn son,</b> from which women are also exempt, <b>are two verses that come as one, and any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> a precedent.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka as well, let procreation,</b> which he maintains applies to women, <b>and fear</b> of one’s mother and father <b>be</b> considered <b>two verses that come as one and</b> they should <b>not teach</b> a precedent. The Gemara answers: Both cases <b>are necessary. As, if the Merciful One had written</b> only that women are obligated in <b>fear</b> of their parents, <b>and had not written</b> that they are obligated in <b>procreation, I would say</b> that as <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “Be fruitful and multiply, replenish the earth <b>and conquer it”</b> (Genesis 1:28), this leads to the conclusion that women are exempt from procreation, by the following reasoning: <b>As</b> it is <b>the manner of a man</b> to go to war and <b>to conquer, yes,</b> he is obligated in procreation, but <b>as it is not the manner of a woman to conquer,</b> she is <b>not</b> obligated in procreation.
<b>And if</b> the Merciful One <b>had written</b> only that women are obligated in the mitzva of <b>procreation, and had not written</b> that they are obligated to <b>fear</b> their parents, <b>I would say:</b> With regard to <b>a man, as</b> it is <b>in his power to perform</b> this mitzva, <b>yes,</b> he is obligated to fear his mother and father, but with regard to <b>a woman, as</b> it is <b>not in her power to perform</b> this mitzva when she is married, since her obligations to her husband may prevent her from doing so, she is <b>not</b> obligated. <b>And as</b> it is <b>not in her power to perform</b> this mitzva when she is married, perhaps women <b>should not be obligated at all</b> and there should be no difference between a married and an unmarried woman. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> for the Torah to state that women are obligated in both procreation and the fear of parents, and these are not considered two verses that come as one.
The Gemara notes that the earlier question remains difficult: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that <b>two verses that come as one do not teach</b> a precedent. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that two verses that come as one <b>do teach</b> a precedent, <b>what can be said?</b> According to this opinion it can be derived that women are obligated in positive, time-bound mitzvot from <i>matza</i> and assembly, and that they are exempt from positive mitzvot that are not time bound, from Torah study and the redemption of the firstborn son. <b>Rava said:</b> The Sages <b>of Pafunya know the reason for this matter.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And who is</b> the scholar called by the nickname: The Sages of Paphunya? It is <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov,</b> who said as follows: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to phylacteries: <b>“And it shall be a sign for you on your arm and for a memorial between your eyes, that the Torah of the Lord may be in your mouth”</b> (Exodus 13:9). In this manner <b>the entire Torah is juxtaposed to phylacteries: Just as</b> donning <b>phylacteries is a positive, time-bound mitzva and women are exempt</b> from it, <b>so too are women exempt</b> from <b>every positive, time-bound mitzva</b> in the Torah. <b>And from the fact</b> that <b>women are exempt from</b> every <b>positive, time-bound mitzva,</b> one can learn <b>by inference</b> that <b>women are obligated in</b> every <b>positive mitzva that is not time bound.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that the mitzva of donning <b>phylacteries</b> is <b>a positive, time-bound mitzva. But according to the one who says</b> that donning <b>phylacteries</b> is <b>a positive mitzva that is not time bound,</b> as it is applicable the entire year, day and night, <b>what can be said?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Who did you hear who said</b> that donning <b>phylacteries</b> is <b>a positive mitzva that is not time bound?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Meir, and he holds</b> that <i>matza</i> and assembly are <b>verses that come as one, and</b> he further maintains that <b>any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> a precedent.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that <b>two verses that come as one do teach</b> a precedent, <b>and</b> who also says that donning <b>phylacteries is a positive mitzva that is not time bound, what can be said?</b> The Gemara answers: It is not derived from here that women are obligated in positive, time-bound mitzvot <b>because</b> the verses that mention <b><i>matza</i>, rejoicing, and assembly are three verses that come as one, and</b> everyone agrees <b>three verses that come as one do not teach</b> a precedent.
§ The mishna further teaches: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all prohibitions,</b> whether or not they are time bound, both men and women are obligated to observe them. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says, and likewise the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: The verse states</b> with regard to a guilt-offering: <b>“When a man or woman shall commit any sin that a person commits”</b> (Numbers 5:6). <b>The verse equates a woman to a man with regard to all punishments in the Torah,</b> as a woman is also required to bring an offering for atonement.
<b>The school of Rabbi Eliezer taught</b> as follows. <b>The verse states:</b> “Now these are the ordinances <b>which you shall set before them”</b> (Exodus 21:1), stating “them” in the plural. This <b>verse equates a woman to a man</b> with regard <b>to all judgments in the Torah,</b> i.e., monetary cases and damages. <b>The school of Ḥizkiyya taught: The verse states,</b> with regard to the ransom one pays if his animal killed a person: <b>“And killed a man or woman”</b> (Exodus 21:29). Here too, <b>the verse equates a woman to a man,</b> with regard <b>to all deaths in the Torah,</b> i.e., the same <i>halakha</i> applies to an animal that kills either a man or a woman.
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state all three of these verses. <b>As, if</b> the Torah <b>had taught us</b> only <b>this first</b> case, with regard to a woman’s obligation to sacrifice guilt-offerings, I would say that <b>the Merciful One has pity on her due to atonement,</b> i.e., God gave her the possibility to atone for her sin through an offering. <b>But</b> with regard to monetary <b>judgments, I</b> would <b>say</b> that with regard to <b>a man, who</b> generally <b>conducts</b> business <b>negotiations, yes,</b> these <i>halakhot</i> apply to him, but in the case of <b>a woman,</b> who generally does not conduct business negotiations, <b>no,</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of monetary judgments do not apply to her.
<b>And</b> similarly <b>if</b> the Torah <b>had taught us</b> only <b>this</b> case of monetary judgments, I would say that these judgments apply to a woman, <b>because</b> there are circumstances where engaging in business <b>is her livelihood. But</b> with regard to the <b>ransom</b> that is paid when one’s animal killed someone, <b>I</b> would <b>say:</b>

Daf 35b

If the animal killed <b>a man, who is commanded in</b> all <b>mitzvot, yes,</b> its owner should have to pay the ransom, but if the animal killed <b>a woman,</b> who is obligated in only some mitzvot, <b>no,</b> he is exempt from the ransom. <b>And</b> conversely: <b>If</b> the Torah had <b>taught us</b> that men and women are equated only in <b>this</b> case of the ransom, one might say that <b>because there is the loss of life the Merciful One has pity on her</b> and therefore the owner of the animal is always obligated to pay the ransom. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>those two</b> other categories, <b>I</b> might <b>say no,</b> a woman is not equated to a man. Therefore it was <b>necessary</b> to mention them all.
§ The mishna teaches that women are obligated in all prohibitions <b>except for</b> the prohibitions of: <b>Do not round</b> the corners of one’s head, <b>and: Do not destroy</b> the corners of your beard, and: Do not contract ritual impurity from a corpse. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> a woman of priestly lineage is not obligated in the mitzva of: <b>Do not contract ritual impurity from a corpse, as it is written: “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron,</b> and say to them: None shall become impure for the dead among his people” (Leviticus 21:1). This verse teaches that the prohibition applies to <b>the sons of Aaron, but not the daughters of Aaron. But from where do we</b> derive the prohibitions of: <b>Do not round</b> the corners of one’s head, <b>and: Do not destroy</b> the corners of your beard?
The Gemara answers that this is <b>as it is written: “You shall not round the corners of your head and you shall not destroy the corners of your beard”</b> (Leviticus 19:27). The juxtaposition of the two prohibitions teaches that <b>anyone who is</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition against <b>destroying</b> the beard <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition against <b>rounding</b> the head. <b>And since these women are not</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition against <b>destroying, they are</b> also <b>not</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition against <b>rounding</b> the head.
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> women <b>are not</b> obligated <b>in</b> the prohibition against <b>destroying</b> the corners of one’s beard? The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, propose</b> a logical <b>reason, as</b> ordinarily women <b>do not have a beard. And if you wish, cite a verse</b> that teaches this point, <b>as the verse states: “You shall not round the corners of your head [<i>roshekhem</i>] and you shall not destroy the corners of your beard [<i>zekanekha</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 19:27).
The Gemara explains: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that the verse changed its language,</b> as the term “your head [<i>roshekhem</i>]” is in the plural while “your beard [<i>zekanekha</i>]” is in the singular, it can be inferred that <b>if so,</b> if the prohibition against destroying one’s beard applied to everyone, <b>let the Merciful One write:</b> And you shall not destroy the <b>corners of your beards [<i>zekanekhem</i>],</b> in the plural, so that the end of the verse parallels the beginning. <b>What</b> is indicated by the fact that the verse states: “And you shall not destroy the corners of <b>your beard [<i>zekanekha</i>],”</b> in the singular? This serves to teach: <b>Your beard</b> is included, <b>but not your wife’s beard.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is a woman <b>not</b> included in this prohibition? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Nega’im</i> 4:8): <b>The beard of a woman and</b> that of <b>a eunuch, if they grow</b> facial <b>hair, are considered like a beard for all matters. What, is it not</b> the case that this statement is referring <b>to</b> the prohibition against <b>destroying?</b>
<b>Abaye said: You cannot say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to destroying, as it is derived</b> that a woman is exempt through the verbal analogy of <b>“the corners</b> of your beard” (Leviticus 19:27) here and <b>“the corners</b> of their beard” (Leviticus 21:5) <b>from the sons of Aaron: Just as there,</b> in the case of priests, <b>women are</b> certainly <b>exempt</b> from the mitzva, as the verse is referring to the male descendants of Aaron who perform the Temple service and not to women, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the prohibition against destroying one’s beard, which is stated to all Jews, <b>women are exempt.</b> At this stage the Gemara assumes that the exclusion of women denoted by the verse: “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron” (Leviticus 21:1), which excludes women, is applied to all the mitzvot stated in that chapter, including destroying the corners of one’s beard.
The Gemara asks: <b>But if we maintain that when</b> the Merciful One <b>writes: “The sons of Aaron”</b> (Leviticus 21:1), it <b>is written with regard to the entire manner</b> of that chapter, including the prohibition against destroying one’s beard, <b>let the verse,</b> i.e., the Torah, <b>be silent</b> and not state <b>about</b> this prohibition concerning all Jews. <b>And</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>could be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, as <b>I</b> could <b>say</b> the following: <b>And if</b> with regard to <b>priests, for whom the verse includes additional mitzvot,</b> this prohibition applies only to <b>the sons of Aaron and not the daughters of Aaron,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> the case with regard to <b>Israelites,</b> who have fewer mitzvot, that only men should be obligated and not women?
The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, the verbal analogy is necessary. <b>Were it not for</b> the <b>verbal analogy, I would say</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity <b>concluded</b> discussion of <b>that matter.</b> In other words, the exclusion of women denoted by the phrase “the sons of Aaron” applies only to the <i>halakhot</i> of impurity, which appear immediately after that phrase. Conversely, the other <i>halakhot</i> mentioned in this chapter, including the prohibition against destroying the beard, apply to women as well.
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>now too, let us say</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity <b>concluded</b> discussion of <b>that matter,</b> and the daughters of Aaron are also prohibited to destroy their beards. <b>And if</b> you maintain that the reason the prohibition stated with regard to priests does not apply to women is <b>due to</b> the <b>verbal analogy</b> employing the term “the corners of,” which serves to connect the <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to priests with the <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to all Jews, that verbal analogy <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to priests: <b>“Neither shall they shave off</b> the corners of their beard” (Leviticus 21:5). One <b>might</b> have thought that a priest <b>would be liable</b> even if <b>he shaved his</b> beard <b>with scissors.</b> Therefore <b>the verse states,</b> in a command issued to all Jews: <b>“And you shall not destroy</b> the corners of your beard” (Leviticus 19:27). This teaches that one is liable only for destroying the beard to the root, which is not achieved with scissors.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>if he extracted</b> his hairs <b>with tweezers,</b> which uproot hairs, <b>or</b> small <b>planes [<i>uvirhitni</i>], he should</b> likewise <b>be liable</b> for destroying his hair. <b>The verse</b> therefore <b>states: “Neither shall they shave off</b> the corners of their beard,” to teach that shaving alone is prohibited and these actions are not considered shaving. <b>How</b> can both <b>these</b> requirements for the prohibition be met? The verse is referring to a type of <b>shaving that involves destruction. You must say</b> this <b>is</b> shaving with <b>a razor.</b> According to this <i>baraita</i>, the verbal analogy is necessary to define the action included in the prohibition against destroying, not to teach who is included in the prohibition.
The Gemara explains: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that the verbal analogy teaches only which action is included in the prohibition against destroying, <b>let the verse write: That which is of your beard. What</b> is added by the expression <b>“the corners of your beard”? Conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from it,</b> both the definition of the prohibition against shaving and the exemption of women.
The Gemara returns to its question. <b>But that which is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The beard of a woman and</b> that of <b>a eunuch, if they grew</b> facial <b>hair, are considered like a beard for all matters, with regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is this stated? <b>Mar Zutra says:</b> It is stated <b>with regard to ritual impurity from leprosy.</b> A leprous sore in the beard of a woman or a eunuch is treated like an affliction of the beard, not like an affliction on the skin. Different <i>halakhot</i> apply to leprous sores that develop on various parts of the body.
The Gemara objects: Concerning <b>ritual impurity from leprosy, it is written explicitly: “And when a man or woman has a plague upon the head or upon the beard”</b> (Leviticus 13:29). This indicates that there is no difference between a man and woman with regard to the beard in the case of leprosy. The <i>baraita</i> would not state a <i>halakha</i> that is explicit in the verse. <b>Rather, Mar Zutra says:</b> This <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to ritual purification from leprosy,</b> i.e., women can also be purified from leprosy of the beard.
The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>ritual purification from leprosy it is also obvious: Since impurity applies to</b> a woman, <b>purity</b> likewise <b>applies to her.</b> The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary</b> to state this with regard to the impurity of afflictions of the beard, as <b>it might enter your mind to say</b> that this verse <b>is written disjunctively,</b> i.e., that the phrase: <b>“And when a man or woman has a plague upon the head,”</b> applies to both a man or a woman; whereas when it states: <b>“Or upon the beard,” we have come back to</b> the case of <b>a man</b> alone. Therefore the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this phrase is not referring solely to a man, as there is no difference between a man and a woman with regard to leprosy.
<b>Isi taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Women are also exempt</b> from the prohibition: <b>Do not make baldness</b> upon your heads, a prohibition against tearing out one’s hair in grief over someone’s death. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of Isi?</b> The Gemara explains <b>that he teaches as follows:</b> The verse states: <b>“You are the sons of the Lord your God; you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead. For you are a holy people to the Lord your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:1–2). This verse, which applies to <b>sons and not daughters,</b> is referring <b>to</b> causing <b>baldness,</b> and therefore this prohibition includes only men.
The Gemara asks: Do <b>you say</b> that this is referring <b>to</b> causing <b>baldness, or is it</b> perhaps referring <b>only to</b> the prohibition against <b>cutting,</b> which appears first? The Gemara answers that <b>when it states: “For you are a holy people to the Lord your God,”</b> it <b>is stated</b> with regard to the prohibition against <b>cutting,</b> and this verse applies to both men and women, as they are all members of God’s people. <b>How</b> then <b>do I realize</b> and explain the emphasis on <b>sons and not daughters?</b> This is referring <b>to</b> the prohibition against causing <b>baldness.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see to include cutting and to exclude</b> causing <b>baldness?</b> Perhaps the opposite is true, and causing baldness applies to men and women whereas cutting applies only to men. The Gemara answers: <b>I include cutting,</b> whose prohibition is broader, <b>as it is</b> applicable both <b>in a place of hair and not in a place of hair; and I exclude</b> causing <b>baldness,</b> which is more limited, <b>as it</b> applies <b>only in a place of hair.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that the limitation of <b>sons and not daughters</b> applies <b>both to</b> causing <b>baldness and to cutting, and when</b> the verse <b>writes: “For you are a holy people to the Lord your God,” that is written with regard to scoring</b> oneself. The prohibition against scoring oneself is derived from a verbal analogy from a verse stated with regard to priests (see Leviticus 21:5), which applies to both men and women. The Gemara answers: <b>Isi maintains</b> that <b>scoring</b> oneself <b>and cutting</b>

Daf 36a

<b>are one</b> prohibition.
<b>Abaye said</b> that <b>this is the reason of Isi</b> for exempting women from the prohibition against baldness: <b>As he learns</b> the prohibition against causing <b>baldness</b> in grief over someone who is dead through a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the prohibition against causing <b>baldness</b> stated with regard to <b>the sons of Aaron.</b> The verse states with regard to priests: “They shall not make baldness upon their head” (Leviticus 21:5). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to priests, <b>women are exempt,</b> as the expression “the sons of Aaron” serves to exclude the daughters of Aaron, <b>so too here, women are exempt.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But if we maintain that when</b> the Merciful One <b>writes:</b> “The sons of Aaron” (Leviticus 21:1), it <b>is written with regard to the entire matter</b> of that chapter, including the prohibition against causing baldness, <b>let the verse be silent about</b> this prohibition concerning all Jews. <b>And</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>could be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, as <b>I</b> could <b>say</b> the following: <b>If</b> in the case of <b>priests, for whom the verse includes additional mitzvot,</b> the prohibition against causing baldness applies only to <b>the sons of Aaron and not the daughters of Aaron,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> the case with regard to <b>Israelites,</b> who have fewer mitzvot, that only the men should be obligated and not the women?
The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, the verbal analogy is necessary. As, <b>were it not for</b> the <b>verbal analogy I would say</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity <b>concluded</b> discussion of <b>that matter,</b> and the prohibition against causing baldness applies to all the descendants of Aaron, including women.
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>now too, let us say</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity <b>concluded</b> discussion of <b>that matter,</b> and it is prohibited for the daughters of Aaron as well to cause baldness. <b>And if</b> you maintain that the reason the prohibition stated with regard to priests does not apply to women is <b>due to</b> the <b>verbal analogy</b> employing the term “make baldness,” which serves to connect the <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to priests with the <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to all Jews, this verbal analogy <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“They shall not make baldness [<i>yikreḥu</i></b> <i>korḥa</i>]” (Leviticus 21:5). If the verse had stated only “<i>yikreḥu</i>,” one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> if <b>one made four or five</b> patches of <b>baldness he would be obligated</b> for <b>only one</b> violation, as there is only one prohibition against making a bald spot. Therefore <b>the verse also states “<i>korḥa</i>,” to render him liable for each and every one</b> of the bald spots.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Upon their head”</b> (Leviticus 21:5), with regard to the prohibition against a priest causing baldness? <b>Because it is stated: “You shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:1), one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he is obligated only for</b> removing the hair <b>between the eyes. From where</b> is it derived <b>to include the entire head</b> in this prohibition? When <b>the verse states “upon their head,”</b> it serves <b>to render</b> a priest <b>liable</b> for removing hair <b>on</b> his entire <b>head like</b> the spot <b>between the eyes.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>priests, for whom the verse includes additional mitzvot; from where do we</b> derive that it applies to every <b>Israelite,</b> i.e., all Jews are liable for each and every bald spot and for the entire head? <b>It is stated here,</b> with regard to priests, <b>“baldness,” and it is stated there,</b> with regard to non-priests, <b>“baldness.” Just as here,</b> with regard to priests, <b>one is obligated for each and every bald spot, and one is obligated for the entire head like</b> the spot <b>between the eyes, so too there,</b> with regard to all Jews, <b>one is obligated for each and every bald spot, and one is obligated for the entire head like</b> the spot <b>between the eyes.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> conversely, <b>just as there,</b> in the case of Israelites, it is referring specifically to causing baldness <b>over</b> someone who is <b>dead, so too here,</b> with regard to priests, it is prohibited to cause baldness only <b>over</b> someone who is <b>dead,</b> not in other circumstances. This <i>baraita</i> shows that the verbal analogy is required for the <i>halakhot</i> of bald spots. How, then, can it teach the exemption of women? The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that it may be used only for one purpose, <b>let the verse be written</b> merely <b>bald [<i>keraḥ</i>]. What</b> is meant by the term <b>“baldness [<i>korḥa</i>]”? Conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from it,</b> both the verbal analogy that exempts women and the <i>halakha</i> that each bald spot constitutes a separate violation.
<b>Rava said</b> that <b>this is Isi’s reason, as he derives</b> the verbal analogy of <b>“between your eyes”</b> with regard to baldness <b>from phylacteries,</b> concerning which it says: “And they shall be for frontlets between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 11:18): <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to phylacteries, <b>women are exempt, so too here,</b> in the case of baldness, <b>women are exempt.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Rava did not state</b> the same reason <b>as Abaye?</b> The Gemara answers: Rava <b>does not learn</b> anything from the distinction between <b><i>keraḥ</i></b> and <b><i>korḥa</i>,</b> as he maintains that no <i>halakha</i> can be derived from this slight difference in language.
The Gemara further asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Abaye did not state</b> the same reason <b>as Rava?</b> The Gemara answers that Abaye could have <b>said to you: Phylacteries themselves are derived from here,</b> i.e., the meaning of the phrase “between your eyes” stated with regard to phylacteries is understood from the case of baldness: <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to a bald spot, “between your eyes” is referring to <b>a place where baldness is formed,</b> a spot where there is hair, which is <b>on the upper part of the head</b> but not actually between the eyes, <b>so too, the place</b> where phylacteries are <b>donned is on the upper part of the head.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And both Abaye and Rava, what do they derive from this</b> verse: <b>“You are the sons</b> to the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 14:1)? According to the first explanation of Isi’s opinion, the exclusion of women is derived from this phrase, whereas they derive that <i>halakha</i> from a different source. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> verse <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: <b>“You are the sons to the Lord your God,”</b> indicates that <b>when you act like sons</b> and cleave to the Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>you are called sons,</b> but when <b>you do not act like sons you are not called sons.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Meir says: Either way you are</b> still <b>called sons, as it is stated: “They are foolish sons”</b> (Jeremiah 4:22). <b>And it</b> also <b>states: “Sons in whom there is no faithfulness”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:20). <b>And it states: “A seed of evildoers, sons who deal corruptly”</b> (Isaiah 1:4). <b>And it states: “And it shall come to pass that, instead of what was said to them: You are not My people, it shall be said to them: Sons of the living God”</b> (Hosea 2:1).
The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is it necessary to cite these additional proofs introduced by the phrase: <b>And it states?</b> All these verses apparently make the same point. The Gemara explains why all the quotes are necessary. <b>And if you would say:</b> Granted, when they are <b>foolish they are</b> still <b>called sons,</b> as the verse states: “Foolish sons,” but <b>when they do not have faithfulness they are not called sons;</b> therefore, <b>come</b> and <b>hear</b> another verse. <b>And</b> that verse <b>states: “Sons in whom there is no faithfulness.”</b>
<b>And if you would say: It is when they do not have faithfulness that they are called sons,</b> as stated, but <b>when</b> they <b>worship idols they are not called sons</b> anymore; therefore, <b>come</b> and <b>hear: And</b> the verse <b>states: “A seed of evildoers, sons who deal corruptly,”</b> which alludes to the corruption of idol worship. <b>And if you would say</b> that although <b>they are called “sons who deal corruptly,” they are no</b> longer <b>called full-fledged sons</b> of God once they have sinned, <b>come</b> and <b>hear: And</b> the <b>verse states: “And it shall come to pass that, instead of what was said to them: You are not My people, it shall be said to them: Sons of the living God.”</b> This verse indicates that when the Jews repent they are again called full-fledged sons of God.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>the placing</b> of <b>hands</b> on the head of an offering, <b>and the waving</b> of certain offerings, <b>and the bringing near</b> of meal-offerings to the corner of the altar, <b>and the removal of a handful</b> from meal-offerings, <b>and the burning</b> of sacrificial parts on the altar, <b>and the pinching</b> of bird-offerings, <b>and the collecting</b> of blood of offerings in a vessel, <b>and the sprinkling</b> of blood, these <b>apply to men and not to women.</b> All these mitzvot apply specifically to men and not to women, <b>except for the meal-offering of a <i>sota</i>, and</b> the meal-offering of <b>a nazirite woman, which</b> these women <b>wave.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> From where is it derived that <b>placing</b> of <b>hands</b> on the head of an offering applies only to men? <b>As it is written: “Speak to the sons of Israel…and he shall place</b> his hand” (Leviticus 1:2–4), which indicates that <b>the sons of Israel place hands</b> on offerings, <b>but the daughters of Israel do not place hands.</b>
The Gemara explains that the <i>halakha</i> of <b>waving</b> is derived from the following verse: <b>“Speak to the sons of Israel…and he shall wave”</b> (see Leviticus 7:29–30), which likewise teaches that <b>the sons of Israel wave, but the daughters of Israel do not wave.</b>
§ With regard to <b>bringing near,</b> this is <b>as it is written: “And this is the law of the meal-offering: The sons of Aaron shall bring it near”</b> (Leviticus 6:7). This teaches that <b>the sons of Aaron</b> bring the meal-offering near, <b>but not the daughters of Aaron.</b>
With regard to <b>the removal of a handful,</b> this is <b>as it is written: “And he shall bring it to the sons of Aaron,</b> the priests, <b>and he shall remove a handful”</b> (Leviticus 2:2). This teaches that <b>the sons of Aaron</b> take a handful, <b>but not the daughters of Aaron.</b>
With regard to the <b>burning</b> of sacrificial parts, this is <b>as it is written: “And the sons of Aaron shall burn it”</b> (Leviticus 3:5). This teaches that it is <b>the sons of Aaron</b> who burn the parts, <b>but not the daughters of Aaron.</b>
With regard to <b>pinching,</b> this is <b>as it is written: “And he shall pinch…and he shall burn”</b> (Leviticus 1:15). The verse <b>juxtaposes killing to burning,</b> and just as the burning of an offering must be performed by men, so too pinching may be performed only by men.
With regard to <b>receiving,</b> this is <b>as it is written: “And the sons of Aaron shall present</b> the blood” (Leviticus 1:5). <b>And the Master said</b> in explanation of this verse:

Daf 36b

<b>“And</b> the sons of Aaron <b>shall present,” this is collecting the blood.</b>
The Gemara discusses the mishna’s ruling that women do not perform <b>sprinkling: To which sprinkling</b> is this referring? <b>If</b> this is the sprinkling of the ashes <b>of</b> the red <b>heifer, “Elazar” is written with regard to that</b> action (Numbers 19:4), i.e., this sprinkling is performed by the deputy High Priest. If even other priests cannot perform it, certainly women cannot. <b>If</b> this is referring <b>to</b> the sprinkling performed <b>inside</b> the Holy of Holies, the phrase: <b>“The anointed priest”</b> (Leviticus 4:16), <b>is written with regard to that</b> rite, and consequently there is no question that women are ineligible. <b>Rather,</b> it is referring to <b>sprinkling</b> the blood <b>of a bird</b>-offering.
The Gemara explains <b>that this is derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from a sheep</b> offering: <b>If</b> with regard to <b>a sheep</b> offering, concerning <b>which</b> the Torah <b>did not establish a priest for its slaughter,</b> since it may be slaughtered by anybody, the Torah nevertheless <b>established a priest for its sprinkling,</b> as the verse states: “And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall sprinkle its blood” (Leviticus 1:11), <b>is it not logical</b> that with regard to <b>a bird</b>-offering, concerning <b>which</b> the Torah <b>established a priest for its pinching,</b> an act parallel to slaughtering a sheep, the Torah likewise <b>established a priest for its sprinkling?</b> This proves that the sprinkling of the blood of a bird-offering can be performed only by priests, not by women.
§ The mishna teaches that these mitzvot apply specifically to men but not to women, <b>except for the meal-offering of a <i>sota</i> and a nazirite woman,</b> which these women wave. <b>Rabbi Elazar said to Rabbi Yoshiya of his generation,</b> i.e., the <i>amora</i> who was his contemporary, not the <i>tanna</i> with the same name who lived earlier: <b>Do not sit down until you explain this statement to me; from where</b> is it derived <b>that the meal-offering of a <i>sota</i> requires waving?</b> The Gemara expresses surprise: What is the meaning of the question: <b>From where do we</b> derive it? <b>It is written in</b> the chapter dealing with a <i>sota</i> <b>itself: “And he shall wave the meal-offering”</b> (Numbers 5:25). <b>Rather,</b> the question is as follows: <b>From where do we</b> derive that the <b>waving</b> is performed <b>by the owners?</b> Perhaps only the priest waves it?
Rabbi Yoshiya responded: This <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived</b> through the verbal analogy of the term <b>“hand”</b> stated with regard to a <i>sota</i> <b>from</b> the term <b>“hand”</b> stated with regard to <b>a peace-offering. It is written here,</b> with regard to the meal-offering of a <i>sota</i>: <b>“And the priest shall take</b> the meal-offering of jealousy <b>from the woman’s hand</b> and he shall wave the meal-offering” (Numbers 5:25), <b>and it is written there: “His own hands shall bring</b> the offerings of the Lord made by fire; the fat with the breast shall he bring, that the breast may be waved before the Lord” (Leviticus 7:30).
<b>Just as here,</b> with regard to a <i>sota</i>, <b>a priest</b> performs the waving, <b>so too there,</b> with regard to a peace-offering, <b>a priest</b> performs the waving. And <b>just as there,</b> with regard to a peace-offering, the <b>owner</b> performs the waving, as indicated by the verse, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to a <i>sota</i>, the <b>owner</b> performs the waving. <b>How so?</b> How can both the priest and the owner perform the waving? The owner places his hands beneath the peace-offering, and the <b>priest places his hand under the hand of the owner and waves</b> it together with him.
The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for the meal-offering of <b>a <i>sota</i>; from where do we</b> derive that <b>a nazirite woman</b> also waves her meal-offering? The Gemara answers: <b>It is derived</b> through a verbal analogy of the term <b>“palm”</b> stated with regard to naziriteship <b>from</b> the term <b>“palm”</b> stated with regard to <b>a <i>sota</i>.</b> The verse concerning naziriteship states: “And he shall place them upon the palms of the nazirite” (Numbers 6:19), and the verse concerning a <i>sota</i> states: “And he shall place it on her palms” (Numbers 5:18). Just as a <i>sota</i> waves her meal-offering, so too, a nazirite woman waves hers.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Any mitzva that is dependent on the land [<i>aretz</i>] applies only in Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>and</b> any mitzva <b>that is not dependent on the land applies both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.

Daf 37a

This is <b>apart from</b> the mitzvot of <b><i>orla</i> and diverse kinds,</b> which apply even outside of Eretz Yisrael. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> with regard to the prohibition to eat from the <b>new crop</b> before the <i>omer</i> offering has been brought on the sixteenth of Nisan.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by mitzvot that are <b>dependent</b> on the land, <b>and what</b> is meant by mitzvot <b>that are not dependent</b> on the land? <b>If we say</b> that a mitzva is called <b>dependent</b> in a case <b>where it is written</b> in a verse <b>with regard to it: Coming</b> to Eretz Yisrael, <b>and</b> a mitzva <b>that is not dependent</b> on the land is one concerning <b>which</b> the verb: <b>Coming,</b> or the verb: Bringing, <b>is not written</b> in a verse <b>with regard to it,</b> that would lead to a difficulty: <b>But aren’t there</b> the mitzvot of donning <b>phylacteries and the</b> redemption of the <b>firstborn donkey, in which</b> the verse <b>states: Bringing,</b> in the passage: “And it shall be when the Lord shall bring you to the land of the Canaanite…And every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb…And it shall be for a sign upon your hand, and for frontlets between your eyes” (Exodus 13:11–16), <b>and</b> yet those mitzvot <b>apply both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying: Any mitzva that is an obligation of the body,</b> i.e., an obligation upon the person, <b>applies both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. Conversely, <b>an obligation of the land,</b> that is, a mitzva that applies specifically to the earth and its growths, <b>applies only in Eretz</b> Yisrael.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: This is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “These are the statutes and the ordinances that you shall observe to do in the land that the Lord, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess it, all the days that you live upon the earth” (Deuteronomy 12:1). This verse is interpreted as follows: The phrase <b>“these are the statutes”</b> means that <b>these are the expositions</b> that the Sages learn from verses. With regard to the phrase <b>“and the ordinances,” these are</b> monetary <b>laws.</b> With regard to <b>“that you shall observe,” this is</b> referring to the <b>study</b> of matters that must be observed for one to perform them. And as for the phrase <b>“to do,” this is</b> referring to <b>action,</b> the actual performance of mitzvot.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: From the phrase <b>“in the land [<i>ba’aretz</i>],”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>all mitzvot apply only in Eretz</b> Yisrael. Therefore, <b>the verse</b> also <b>states “all the days that you live upon the earth,”</b> i.e., wherever you live. Furthermore, <b>if</b> the Merciful One had written only the phrase <b>“all the days,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that all mitzvot <b>should apply both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. Therefore, <b>the verse</b> also <b>states “in the land.”</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Once the verse includes</b> areas outside of Eretz Yisrael <b>and</b> also <b>excludes</b> areas outside of Eretz Yisrael, how is it determined which mitzvot apply outside the land and which do not? The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>Go and learn from what is stated with regard to</b> a different <b>issue</b> that appears in the next verse: <b>“You shall destroy all the places where</b> the nations that you are to dispossess <b>served</b> their gods” (Deuteronomy 12:2). <b>Just as</b> the prohibition of <b>idol worship is distinct</b> in <b>that it is an obligation of the body, and it applies both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>so too, any</b> mitzva <b>that is an obligation of the body applies both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. Conversely, mitzvot that are an obligation connected to the land apply only in Eretz Yisrael.
§ The mishna teaches that all mitzvot that are dependent on the land apply only in Eretz Yisrael, <b>apart from <i>orla</i> and</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds.</b> Rabbi Eliezer says: This is the <i>halakha</i> even with regard to the prohibition to eat from the new crop. <b>A dilemma was raised before them:</b> Does <b>Rabbi Eliezer disagree</b> with the first <i>tanna</i> with the intent to rule more <b>leniently or</b> does <b>he disagree</b> with the first <i>tanna</i> with the intent to rule more <b>stringently?</b>
The Gemara elaborates: It is possible that Rabbi Eliezer <b>disagrees</b> with the first <i>tanna</i> with the intent to rule more <b>stringently, and this is what the first <i>tanna</i> is saying:</b> All mitzvot that are dependent on the land apply only in Eretz Yisrael, <b>apart from <i>orla</i> and diverse kinds, as we learned this <i>halakha</i> through a tradition</b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai. <b>Although one could say</b> that each of them <b>is an obligation of the land</b> and should apply only in Eretz Yisrael, nevertheless they are obligatory outside of Eretz Yisrael as well. <b>But</b> the prohibition of the <b>new crop,</b> which is an obligation of the land, <b>yes,</b> it applies <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael, but <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>no,</b> it does not apply.
<b>What is the reason</b> of the first <i>tanna</i>? In the verse that states with regard to the new crop: “In all your dwellings” (Leviticus 23:14), the term <b>dwelling</b> does not mean that this <i>halakha</i> applies wherever Jews live. Rather, it means that the mitzva is applicable only in Eretz Yisrael, as this phrase <b>indicates</b> a time <b>after inheritance and settlement</b> of Eretz Yisrael by the Jewish people, when they are actually dwelling in the land, not when they are in the process of conquering it. This is the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i>.
<b>And Rabbi Eliezer comes to say: Even</b> the prohibition with regard to the <b>new crop applies both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. <b>What is the reason</b> for his opinion? He explains that the term <b>dwelling</b> means <b>wherever you dwell.</b> This is one possible way to understand the dispute, according to which the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer is more stringent than that of the first <i>tanna</i>.
<b>Or perhaps</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>disagrees</b> with the first <i>tanna</i> with the intent to rule more <b>leniently, and this is what the first <i>tanna</i> is saying:</b> All mitzvot that are dependent on the land apply only in Eretz Yisrael, <b>apart from <i>orla</i> and diverse kinds, as we learned this <i>halakha</i> through tradition, and all the more so</b> apart from the <b>new crop,</b> which applies outside of Eretz Yisrael, <b>as</b> the term <b>dwelling indicates wherever you dwell.</b> This is the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i>.
<b>And Rabbi Eliezer comes to say:</b> The prohibition of the <b>new crop applies only in Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>as</b> the term <b>dwelling indicates</b> a time <b>after inheritance and settlement</b> of Eretz Yisrael by the Jewish people. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> accordingly, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the word: <b>Even,</b> with which Rabbi Eliezer begins his statement? It is not referring to <i>orla</i> and diverse kinds, which apply outside of Eretz Yisrael, but <b>to the first</b> clause, which states that a mitzva that is dependent on the land applies only in Eretz Yisrael. Rabbi Eliezer adds that this principle includes the new crop as well.
Having presented the two ways in which one can explain the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, the Gemara attempts to prove which is correct and suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from that <b>which Abaye said: Who</b> is the <b><i>tanna</i> who disagrees with Rabbi Eliezer? It is Rabbi Yishmael. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the mitzva of bringing libations with offerings: This serves <b>to teach you that wherever</b> the term <b>dwelling is stated,</b> the mitzva in question applies <b>only after</b> the <b>inheritance and settlement</b> of Eretz Yisrael. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b>
<b>Rabbi Akiva said to him:</b> But there is the case of <b>Shabbat, in which it is stated:</b> “It is a Shabbat to the Lord in all your <b>dwellings”</b> (Leviticus 23:3), <b>and</b> this mitzva <b>applies both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to</b> Rabbi Akiva: <b>Shabbat is derived through</b> the following <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If less stringent mitzvot apply both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, is it <b>not all the more so</b> reasonable that <b>Shabbat,</b> which is <b>a stringent</b> mitzva, should apply everywhere?
The Gemara explains the proof. <b>From</b> the fact <b>that Abaye said: Who is the <i>tanna</i> who disagrees with Rabbi Eliezer,</b> it is <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> and Rabbi Yishmael says that the term dwelling means that the mitzva applies after Eretz Yisrael has been entirely settled, one can <b>conclude from</b> it that <b>Rabbi Eliezer disagrees</b> with the first <i>tanna</i> with the intent to rule more <b>stringently,</b> as he evidently maintains that the term dwelling means wherever Jews are located. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> that <i>baraita</i> that it is so.
The Gemara asks an incidental question with regard to Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion. <b>Now, where does Rabbi Yishmael stand,</b> i.e., to which specific mitzva is he referring? He is referring <b>to</b> the obligation to bring <b>libations,</b> from which he learns that all mitzvot that feature the term dwelling apply only after Eretz Yisrael had been conquered and settled. <b>With regard to libations</b>

Daf 37b

both the term: <b>Coming, and</b> the term: <b>Dwelling, are written:</b> “When you come into the land of your dwellings” (Numbers 15:2). How, then, can Rabbi Yishmael cite this example to teach about cases where only the term dwelling is written? The Gemara answers that <b>this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: This teaches that wherever</b> both <b>coming and dwelling are stated,</b> it applies <b>only after inheritance and settlement</b> of Eretz Yisrael; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> consider that <b>Rabbi Akiva said to him:</b> But there is the verse stated with regard to <b>Shabbat</b> (Leviticus 23:3), <b>in which it is stated “dwellings,” and</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to him: Shabbat is derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference. But <b>let</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>say to</b> Rabbi Akiva instead: <b>I say</b> my principle only when <b>coming and dwelling</b> are both written, and in the case of Shabbat the verse states only the term dwelling. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yishmael <b>states one</b> reason <b>and</b> adds <b>another</b> reason. <b>One</b> reason is <b>that I say</b> my principle only when <b>coming and dwelling</b> are written together. <b>And another</b> reason: With regard to <b>that which you say</b> that there is the case of <b>Shabbat, in which it is stated “dwellings,” Shabbat is derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference.
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do</b> Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>They disagree</b> with regard to whether the Jews <b>sacrificed libations in the wilderness. Rabbi Yishmael maintains: They did not sacrifice libations in the wilderness,</b> as the obligation to sacrifice libations came into effect only once they were living in Eretz Yisrael. <b>And Rabbi Akiva maintains: They did sacrifice libations in the wilderness.</b> Rabbi Akiva derives a different <i>halakha</i> from the term dwelling.
<b>Abaye said: This</b> statement of the <b><i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael,</b> that only when the terms coming and dwelling are both written does the mitzva takes effect after settling Eretz Yisrael, <b>diverges from another</b> statement of the <b><i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael.</b>
This is <b>as</b> the <b><i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Since</b> instances of <b>coming</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>are mentioned in the Torah</b> in connection to several mitzvot, <b>without specifying</b> precisely when the Jewish people are considered to have arrived there, <b>and the verse specified in one of</b> its references that it applies only <b>after inheritance and settlement</b> of Eretz Yisrael, in the mitzva of appointing a king: “When you come to the land…and you inherit it and settle it” (Deuteronomy 17:14), <b>so too, wherever</b> coming to the land is mentioned without qualification, it means <b>after inheritance and settlement.</b> According to this opinion, there is no need for the verse to also mention the term dwelling.
<b>And</b> the <b>other</b> <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael, cited in the dispute with Rabbi Akiva, would say that this is no proof, <b>because there is</b> not only the case of <b>a king</b> but also the mitzva of <b>first fruits,</b> where the verse also uses the terms of coming, inheriting, and dwelling (see Deuteronomy 26:1). Consequently, these are <b>two verses that come as one,</b> i.e., to teach the same matter. <b>And any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> a precedent that applies to other cases.
<b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, i.e., the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael cited by Abaye, would answer: Both these cases <b>are necessary,</b> as one cannot be derived from the other. <b>As, if the Merciful One</b> had <b>written</b> this matter only with regard to <b>a king, and had not written</b> it concerning <b>first fruits, I would say:</b> This delay applies only to the mitzva of appointing a king, whereas with regard to the mitzva of <b>first fruits, since one benefits</b> from eating the fruit he should have to bring it <b>immediately</b> and not wait until the land has been inherited and settled. <b>And</b> conversely, <b>had</b> the Merciful One <b>written</b> this matter only with regard to <b>first fruits and had not written</b> it in the case of <b>a king, I would say</b> that as it is <b>the manner of a king to conquer,</b> one must be appointed <b>immediately,</b> even before entering Eretz Yisrael.
<b>And the other,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael, cited in the dispute with Rabbi Akiva, would respond: <b>Let the Merciful One write</b> this with regard to <b>a king, and it would not be required</b> to write it in the case of <b>first fruits,</b> as <b>I would say: And if a king, whose</b> task is <b>to conquer</b> Eretz Yisrael, nevertheless is appointed only <b>after inheritance and settlement,</b> with regard to <b>first fruits</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> reasonable that a similar <i>halakha</i> apply to them? If so, these are two verses that come as one, which do not teach a precedent.
<b>And the other,</b> i.e., the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael cited by Abaye, would say: <b>If</b> the Merciful One had <b>written this</b> only with regard to a king, <b>I would say</b> that the Jews should be obligated in the mitzva of first fruits immediately upon entering Eretz Yisrael, and I would not derive the <i>halakha</i> of first fruits from that of appointing a king, <b>just as it is with regard to</b> the separation of <b><i>ḥalla</i>,</b> another priestly gift from one’s produce, which applied immediately upon the entrance to Eretz Yisrael. Therefore the verse is necessary, as it <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so.
§ The Gemara asks: <b>And now that you said</b> that <b>an obligation of the body applies both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>why do I</b> need the term <b>“dwelling” that the Merciful One writes with regard to Shabbat</b> (Leviticus 23:3)? The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to say this, as <b>it might enter your mind to say: Since</b> the mitzva of Shabbat <b>was written in the context of the Festivals, it should require sanctification</b> by the court, <b>like the Festivals,</b> which rely on the sanctification of the New Moon by the court. Therefore the verse <b>teaches us</b> that this is not required.
The Gemara further asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the term <b>dwelling, which the Merciful One writes with regard to</b> the consumption of forbidden <b>fat and blood</b> in the verse: “A perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that you shall eat neither forbidden fat nor blood” (Leviticus 3:17)? The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to state this, as <b>it might enter your mind to say: Since</b> these prohibitions <b>are written in the context of the offerings,</b> then <b>when there is an offering</b> and the priests sacrifice fat and blood upon the altar, i.e., when the Temple is standing, that is when forbidden <b>fat and blood are forbidden</b> for consumption. But <b>when there is no offering,</b> forbidden fat and blood are <b>not</b> forbidden. The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that they are always forbidden.
Additionally, the Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the term <b>dwelling, which the Merciful One writes with regard to <i>matza</i> and bitter herbs,</b> in the verse: “In all your dwellings you shall eat <i>matza</i>” (Exodus 12:20)? The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to state this, as <b>it might enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written: “They shall eat</b> the Paschal offering <b>with <i>matza</i> and bitter herbs”</b> (Numbers 9:11), <b>when there is a Paschal offering, yes,</b> one must eat it with <i>matza</i> and bitter herbs, but <b>when there is no Paschal offering,</b> i.e., when the Temple is not standing, there is <b>no</b> obligation to eat <i>matza</i> and bitter herbs. The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that these mitzvot apply every Passover, whether or not the Temple is standing.
The Gemara further asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the term <b>coming, which the Merciful One writes with regard to phylacteries and the firstborn donkey,</b> at the start of the Torah passage which discusses these mitzvot: “And it shall be when the Lord will bring you into the land of the Canaanite” (Exodus 13:11)? The Gemara answers: <b>That verse is necessary for that which</b> the <i>tanna</i> of <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Perform this mitzva</b> of donning phylacteries, <b>on account of which</b> you shall be rewarded and <b>enter Eretz</b> Yisrael.
The Gemara asks about the term dwelling, written in connection to the prohibition of the new crop. <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that the term <b>dwelling indicates wherever you dwell, this</b> explains the fact <b>that it is written</b> with regard to the Jewish people immediately after they entered Eretz Yisrael: <b>“And they ate the produce of the land on the morrow after the Passover”</b> (Joshua 5:11). This means that <b>on the day after the Passover</b> they <b>ate</b> the produce of Eretz Yisrael, but <b>initially,</b> before that date, they <b>did not eat</b> it. <b>Apparently,</b>

Daf 38a

<b>they sacrificed the <i>omer</i> and</b> only <b>afterward</b> did they <b>eat.</b>
<b>But according to the one who says</b> that the term dwelling indicates that the prohibition of the new crop applies only <b>after inheritance and settlement</b> of Eretz Yisrael, <b>let</b> the Jews <b>eat</b> the produce of the land <b>immediately.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>They did not need</b> to eat the new produce, as they still had manna. Although they did not eat the new crop of Eretz Yisrael, the reason was not that it was prohibited.
This is <b>as it is written: “And the children of Israel ate the manna forty years until they came to a settled land; they ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan”</b> (Exodus 16:35). The Gemara analyzes this verse: <b>One cannot say</b> they ate <b>“until they came to a settled land,”</b> i.e., that they were still eating the manna when they entered Eretz Yisrael, <b>as it is already stated: “To the borders of the land of Canaan,”</b> which indicates that they stopped eating manna before entering Eretz Yisrael, on the plains of Moab. <b>And one cannot say</b> that they ate manna only until they reached <b>“to the borders of the land of Canaan,” as it is already stated: “Until they came to a settled land.” How</b> can <b>these</b> clauses be reconciled? <b>Moses died on the seventh of Adar and the manna ceased falling, and they ate the manna that was</b> left <b>in their vessels until the sixteenth of Nisan,</b> even after they entered Eretz Yisrael.
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“And the children of Israel ate the manna forty years”</b> (Exodus 16:35). <b>But did they</b> really <b>eat</b> it for <b>forty years? But didn’t they eat</b> it for <b>forty years less thirty days?</b> The manna began to fall on the sixteenth of Iyyar in the first year in the wilderness, and they stopped eating it on the sixteenth of Nisan in the fortieth year. <b>Rather, this</b> verse comes <b>to tell you</b> that <b>they tasted the taste of manna</b> in the unleavened <b>cakes that they took out from Egypt</b> on the fifteenth of Nisan in their first year, and this sustained them until the manna fell.
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>Moses died on the seventh of Adar, and he was</b> likewise <b>born on the seventh of Adar. From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> Moses <b>died on the seventh of Adar? As it is stated: “So Moses, the servant of the Lord, died there”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:5), <b>and it is written: “And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:8). <b>And it is written: “Now it came to pass after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord”</b> (Joshua 1:1), <b>and it is written: “Moses, My servant, is dead; now arise, cross</b> this Jordan” (Joshua 1:2).
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And it is written: “Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people, saying: Prepare your victuals, for within three days you are to cross the Jordan”</b> (Joshua 1:11). <b>And it is written: “And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month”</b> (Joshua 4:19). <b>Subtract retroactively from</b> that date, the tenth of Nisan, <b>the last thirty-three days,</b> i.e., the thirty days of mourning for Moses and the three days of preparation before crossing the Jordan, and you <b>learn</b> from here <b>that Moses died on the seventh of Adar.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And from where</b> is it derived that <b>Moses was born on the seventh of Adar?</b> It is <b>as it is stated: “And he said to them, I am one hundred and twenty years old today; I can no more go out and come in”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:2). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state “today,”</b> since Moses could have said simply: I am one hundred and twenty years old. <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “today”?</b> One can learn from it that Moses was born on that date, i.e., he was exactly one hundred and twenty years old. <b>This teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, sits and completes the years of the righteous from day to day and from month to month, as it is stated: “The number of your days I will fulfill”</b> (Exodus 23:26).
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: The Jewish people were commanded</b> to perform <b>three mitzvot</b> immediately <b>upon entering Eretz</b> Yisrael: The new crop, diverse kinds, and <i>orla</i>, <b>and</b> these <b>apply both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.
<b>And it is logical,</b> i.e., one can derive through an <i>a fortiori</i> argument <b>that</b> each of these mitzvot <b>should apply</b> everywhere. <b>If</b> the prohibition of the <b>new crop, whose prohibition is not a permanent prohibition,</b> as it does not apply to grain that grows after the <i>omer</i> has been sacrificed on the sixteenth of Nisan, <b>and whose prohibition is not a prohibition against</b> deriving <b>benefit,</b> since usages other than eating are permitted, <b>and there is dissolution for its prohibition,</b> i.e., grain that grew before the sixteenth of Nisan becomes permitted after the <i>omer</i> offering has been brought, <b>applies both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, the same <i>halakha</i> should certainly apply to diverse kinds.
Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai elaborates: With regard to <b>diverse kinds, whose prohibition is a permanent prohibition,</b> as it never expires, <b>and whose prohibition is a prohibition against</b> deriving <b>benefit,</b> since one may not benefit in any manner from diverse kinds of the vine, <b>and there is no dissolution for its prohibition, is it not logical that it should apply both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael? <b>And the same is true of <i>orla</i> with regard to two</b> of those points. <i>Orla</i> is not a permanent prohibition, as it applies only for the first three years that a tree produces fruit, but one may not derive benefit from it, and produce from the first three years never becomes permitted.
<b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says:</b>

Daf 38b

<b>Any mitzva that the Jewish people were commanded</b> to perform <b>before entering Eretz</b> Yisrael, i.e., it was not linked to entry into the land, <b>applies both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. Conversely, any mitzva that they were commanded to perform <b>after they entered Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>applies only in Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>except for</b> the <b>abrogation of monetary</b> debts in the Sabbatical Year (see Deuteronomy 15:1–2), <b>and</b> the <b>emancipation of slaves</b> in the Jubilee Year (see Leviticus 25:39–41). <b>Even though</b> the Jews <b>were commanded with regard to these</b> mitzvot that they were to perform them only <b>after their entry into Eretz</b> Yisrael, these mitzvot <b>apply both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.
The Gemara questions the need for this ruling: <b>The abrogation of monetary</b> debts <b>is an obligation of the body.</b> Since this mitzva is not referring to the land, what is the novelty of the ruling that it applies even outside of Eretz Yisrael?
The Gemara answers: <b>It is necessary</b> to mention the cancellation of debts <b>only for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The verse states in the context of the cancellation of debts: <b>“And this is the manner of the abrogation: He shall abrogate”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:2). <b>The verse speaks of two</b> types of <b>abrogation: One</b> is <b>the release of land and one</b> is the <b>abrogation of monetary</b> debts. Since the two are juxtaposed, one can learn the following: <b>At a time when you release land,</b> when the Jubilee Year is practiced, <b>you abrogate monetary</b> debts; <b>at a time when you do not release land,</b> such as the present time, when the Jubilee Year is no longer practiced, <b>you</b> also <b>do not abrogate monetary</b> debts.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that one can learn the following from this juxtaposition: <b>In a place</b> where <b>you release land,</b> i.e., in Eretz Yisrael, <b>you abrogate monetary</b> debts, <b>and in a place</b> where <b>you do not release land, you do not abrogate monetary</b> debts. If so, the abrogation of debts would apply only in Eretz Yisrael, despite the fact that this obligation is not related to the land. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Because the Lord’s abrogation has been proclaimed”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:2), to indicate that this obligation applies <b>in any case,</b> even outside of Eretz Yisrael. This is the novelty of the statement of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon.
The Gemara questions the need for second ruling of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon: <b>The emancipation of slaves is</b> also <b>an obligation of the body,</b> not one that applies to the land. What is novel about this ruling? The Gemara answers that <b>it might enter your mind to say: Since it is written: “And proclaim liberty throughout the land</b> unto all the inhabitants thereof” (Leviticus 25:10), one could say: <b>“Throughout the land,” yes,</b> this mitzva applies, but <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>no,</b> the emancipation does not take effect. Therefore <b>the</b> same <b>verse</b> also <b>states</b> the seemingly superfluous phrase: <b>“It shall be a Jubilee”</b> (Leviticus 25:10), to indicate that it applies <b>in any case,</b> in all places.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Throughout the land”?</b> The Gemara answers that this phrase teaches: <b>When the liberty</b> of slaves <b>applies in Eretz</b> Yisrael, it also <b>applies outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, and when <b>the liberty</b> of slaves <b>does not apply in Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>it does not apply outside</b> of <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael. The mitzva depends on whether the Jubilee Year is in effect, not on the place in question.
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Orla</i> 3:9): <b>The new crop is forbidden by Torah law everywhere; <i>orla</i></b> is forbidden outside of Eretz Yisrael according to <b>a <i>halakha</i>,</b> as the Gemara will immediately explain; <b>and diverse kinds</b> are forbidden outside the land <b>by rabbinic law.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is this <b><i>halakha</i>,</b> mentioned with regard to <i>orla</i>? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> It is the <b>local <i>halakha</i>,</b> i.e., this was the practice of Jews in places where they settled. <b>Ulla</b> says that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai.</b>
<b>Ulla said to Rav Yehuda: Granted, according to my</b> opinion, <b>as I say</b> in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan that the mishna means that this is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai, this is</b> the reason <b>why we distinguish between</b> fruit whose status as <b><i>orla</i></b> is <b>uncertain,</b> which is forbidden outside of Eretz Yisrael according to the <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, <b>and</b> produce whose status as <b>diverse kinds</b> is <b>uncertain,</b> which is permitted outside of Eretz Yisrael, as the prohibition of diverse kinds applies outside of Eretz Yisrael only by rabbinic law.
This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 3:9): Fruit whose status as <b><i>orla</i></b> is <b>uncertain is forbidden in Eretz</b> Yisrael, and <b>it is permitted in Syria</b> with no concern about its uncertain status. <b>Outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, a Jew may <b>go down</b> into the gentile’s field <b>and purchase</b> fruit that is <i>orla</i> from the gentile, <b>provided that</b> the Jew <b>does not see him gather</b> it.
<b>Nevertheless, we learned</b> in a mishna <b>with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>diverse kinds</b> (<i>Orla</i> 3:9): If <b>a vineyard has vegetables planted in it, and</b> there are <b>vegetables being sold outside</b> the vineyard, but there is no proof that these vegetables came from the vineyard, <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael they are <b>forbidden.</b> The reason is that as it is possible that the vegetables came from the vineyard, the <i>halakha</i> is stringent in a case involving a prohibition by Torah law. <b>In Syria</b> these vegetables are <b>permitted.</b>
<b>Outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, if the gentile owner of a field containing diverse kinds <b>goes down</b> into his field <b>and gathers</b> produce, then, <b>provided that</b> the Jew <b>does not gather</b> it <b>by hand,</b> he may purchase the produce from the gentile. This indicates that outside of Eretz Yisrael there is a difference between <i>orla</i> of uncertain status and diverse kinds of uncertain status. This is understandable if <i>orla</i> is forbidden by a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, while diverse kinds are forbidden by rabbinic law.
<b>But according to your</b> opinion, that neither <i>orla</i> nor diverse kinds is forbidden by Torah law,

Daf 39a

<b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> in the same manner in both cases, <b>either</b> by stating in <b>both this</b> case <b>and that</b> case that <b>one may go down and purchase</b> the produce, <b>or</b> by stating in <b>both this</b> case <b>and that</b> case that <b>one may go down and gather</b> the produce. The Gemara answers: <b>Didn’t Shmuel say to Rav Anan</b> that one should <b>teach it either</b> as stating in <b>both this</b> case <b>and that</b> case that <b>one may go down and purchase</b> the produce, <b>or</b> in <b>both this</b> case <b>and that</b> case that <b>one may go down and gather</b> the produce? <b>Mar, son of Rabbana, taught this</b> mishna according to the following <b>lenient</b> version: In <b>both this</b> case <b>and that</b> case <b>one may go down and gather</b> the produce, <b>provided that he does not gather</b> it <b>with</b> his own <b>hand.</b>
§ With regard to the prohibition of <i>orla</i> outside of Eretz Yisrael, the Gemara relates that <b>Levi said to Shmuel: Aryokh,</b> Shmuel’s nickname, <b>supply me</b> with such food, as I will not pick it on my own, <b>and</b> if you do so <b>I will eat</b> it. There is no reason for concern with regard to <i>orla</i> outside of Eretz Yisrael. <b>Rav Avya and Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan would supply</b> produce whose <i>orla</i> status was uncertain <b>for each other,</b> as it is forbidden only if one takes the <i>orla</i> on his own. <b>The sharp</b> Sages <b>of Pumbedita said:</b> The prohibition of <b><i>orla</i> does not</b> apply at all <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.
<b>Rav Yehuda sent</b> a question <b>to Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> concerning the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <i>orla</i> outside of Eretz Yisrael. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan sent him</b> the following response: <b>Conceal,</b> i.e., do not publicize, the <i>halakha</i> that produce whose <i>orla</i> status is <b>uncertain</b> is permitted; <b>and destroy,</b> i.e., prohibit entirely, produce whose <i>orla</i> status is <b>certain; and with regard to</b> the <b>produce of</b> those who are lenient in this <i>halakha</i>, <b>declare that it requires interment,</b> as it is prohibited to derive benefit from such produce. <b>And whoever says</b> that there is <b>no</b> prohibition of <b><i>orla</i> outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>will have neither a child nor a grandchild “who shall cast the line by lot in the congregation of the Lord”</b> (Micah 2:5).
The Gemara asks: <b>And in accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>do</b> the sharp Sages of Pumbedita <b>hold</b> when they state this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: They hold <b>in accordance with that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, says in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Durmaska, who said in the name of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, who said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer the Great:</b> The prohibition of <b><i>orla</i></b> does <b>not</b> apply <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.
The Gemara expresses surprise at this ruling: <b>But</b> does it <b>not</b> apply? Does Rabbi Eliezer maintain that the prohibition of <i>orla</i> does not apply outside of Eretz Yisrael? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Even</b> the <b>new crop,</b> which indicates that he agrees that <i>orla</i> and diverse kinds are forbidden outside of Eretz Yisrael? The Gemara answers that one should not <b>teach</b> that Rabbi Eliezer said: Even the new crop, but rather teach only the words: The <b>new crop,</b> i.e., Rabbi Eliezer maintains that only this prohibition applies outside of Eretz Yisrael.
<b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: <i>Orla</i></b> is forbidden <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael by <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai. Rabbi Zeira said to Rabbi Asi: But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to produce whose status concerning <b><i>orla</i></b> is <b>uncertain, in Eretz</b> Yisrael it is <b>forbidden, in Syria</b> it is <b>permitted,</b> and <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>one goes down and gathers</b> it? And if <i>orla</i> is forbidden outside of Eretz Yisrael by a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, why is produce whose status concerning <i>orla</i> is uncertain permitted in Syria? Rabbi Zeira <b>“was dismayed for a while”</b> (Daniel 4:16), and then Rabbi Asi <b>said to him: Say</b> that <b>it is stated like this,</b> i.e., explain that the <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai was that outside of Eretz Yisrael produce whose status concerning <i>orla</i> is <b>uncertain</b> is <b>permitted, and</b> produce whose status concerning <i>orla</i> is <b>certain</b> is <b>forbidden.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Offenders <b>are flogged for</b> transgressing the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds</b> outside of Eretz Yisrael <b>by Torah law. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, said to him: But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna (<i>Orla</i> 3:9) that the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds</b> applies <b>by rabbinic law</b> outside of Eretz Yisrael? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult.</b> The mishna <b>here</b> is referring <b>to diverse kinds in a vineyard,</b> which is prohibited outside of Eretz Yisrael by rabbinic law, whereas <b>there,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement is referring <b>to</b> the <b>grafting of a tree</b> onto a different species.
The Gemara adds that this <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel. As Shmuel says:</b> The verse states: <b>“You shall keep My statutes”</b> (Leviticus 19:19), which means that one must keep even the <b>statutes that I have already instituted for you</b> when you were merely descendants of Noah, before the giving of the Torah. Shmuel elaborates: This is referring to the prohibitions stated in that same verse: <b>“You shall not let your cattle gender with a diverse kind; you shall not sow your field</b> with two kinds of seed” (Leviticus 19:19).
Additionally, the juxtaposition of these prohibitions teaches that <b>just as</b> the prohibition of diverse kinds stated with regard to <b>your animal</b> applies only <b>to mating</b> one species with another, <b>so too,</b> the prohibition of diverse kinds with regard to <b>your field</b> is referring only <b>to grafting</b> one type of tree to another type, and it does not apply to planting two species together. Furthermore, <b>just as</b> the prohibition of diverse kinds with regard to <b>your animal applies both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, as this prohibition does not relate to the land, <b>so too,</b> the prohibition against grafting <b>your field applies both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “Your field,”</b> which indicates that the field belongs to you in your portion of Eretz Yisrael? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse serves <b>to exclude</b> the prohibition of diverse kinds of <b>seeds,</b> which does not apply <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. Planting different types of seeds together is prohibited only in Eretz Yisrael.
§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Ḥanan and Rav Anan were</b> once <b>going</b> together <b>on a road</b> outside of Eretz Yisrael and <b>they saw a certain man planting seeds</b> of diverse kinds <b>together.</b> One of them <b>said to</b> the other: <b>Let the Master come</b> and <b>ostracize him,</b> as he is performing a prohibited act. The other <b>said to him:</b> These <i>halakhot</i> <b>are not understood by you.</b>
<b>And furthermore, they</b> also <b>saw a certain man who was planting wheat and barley between grapevines.</b> One of them <b>said to</b> the other: <b>Let the Master come</b> and <b>ostracize him. He</b> again <b>said to him:</b> These <i>halakhot</i> are <b>not clear to you.</b> He explained: <b>Don’t we hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoshiya, who says:</b> One who sows diverse kinds is not liable by Torah law <b>until he sows wheat, and barley, and</b> a grape <b>seed with a single hand motion,</b> i.e., by sowing in the vineyard he violates the prohibition of diverse kinds that applies to seeds and to the vineyard simultaneously. Since this man was not planting in that manner, he should not be ostracized.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Yosef</b> was <b>mixing</b> diverse <b>seeds and planting</b> them. <b>Abaye said to him: But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that mixing <b>diverse kinds</b> is prohibited outside of Eretz Yisrael <b>by rabbinic law?</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to him:</b> This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>here,</b> the mishna is referring <b>to diverse kinds in a vineyard,</b> and <b>there,</b> I am planting legally because I am planting only <b>diverse kinds of seeds.</b> The reason for the difference between these two cases is as follows: With regard to planting <b>diverse kinds in a vineyard, which in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>is prohibited</b> even <b>with regard to</b> deriving <b>benefit, the Sages issued a decree</b> prohibiting this mixture <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael as well. Conversely, with regard to planting <b>diverse kinds of seeds, which in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>is not prohibited with regard to</b> deriving <b>benefit, the Sages did not issue a decree</b> prohibiting <b>them outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.
<b>Rav Yosef then said: The matter that I said,</b> i.e., that diverse kinds of seeds are entirely permitted outside of Eretz Yisrael, <b>is not</b> so. The proof is that <b>Rav planted the garden</b> around <b>the study hall in rows [<i>mesharei</i>]</b> of different species. <b>What is the reason</b> that he did that rather than plant different species together? Is it <b>not because</b> he was concerned about <b>mixtures of diverse kinds? Abaye said to him:</b> That is not proof. <b>Granted, if he taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> through his actions,

Daf 39b

and he was careful to plant <b>four</b> different species <b>along the four sides of the garden bed and one in the middle,</b> so that there would be space between them, it works out <b>well.</b> This would show that Rav was cautious not to plant diverse kinds together. <b>But here,</b> where Rav actually planted each species in its own bed, he did so <b>due to beautification,</b> i.e., to improve the appearance of the garden in front of the study hall. <b>Alternatively,</b> the reason Rav planted this way <b>is due to the trouble</b> that would be caused to <b>the attendant.</b> When his attendant would be sent to fetch a certain type of vegetable from the garden he would not need to search for it, but would know where the different vegetables were planted. Therefore, this does not prove that Rav was concerned about diverse kinds outside of Eretz Yisrael.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Anyone who performs one mitzva has goodness bestowed upon him, his life is lengthened, and he inherits the land,</b> i.e., life in the World-to-Come. <b>And anyone who does not perform one mitzva does not have goodness bestowed upon him, his life is not lengthened, and he does not inherit the land</b> of the World-to-Come.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 1:1): <b>These</b> are the <b>matters that a person</b> engages in and <b>enjoys their profits in this world, and the principal</b> reward <b>remains for him for the World-to-Come,</b> and <b>they are: Honoring one’s father and mother, acts of loving kindness, hospitality</b> toward <b>guests, and bringing peace between one person and another; and Torah study is equal to all of them.</b> This indicates that one is rewarded in this world only for fulfilling these mitzvot, but not for fulfilling all mitzvot.
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying: Anyone who performs one mitzva in addition to his</b> other <b>merits,</b> and thereby tips the scale of all his deeds to the side of righteousness, <b>has goodness bestowed upon him and is compared to one who fulfills the entire Torah.</b> The Gemara asks: One can learn <b>by inference</b> from here <b>that</b> with regard to <b>those</b> mitzvot listed in the mishna in <i>Pe’a</i> one is rewarded <b>even for one</b> of them, notwithstanding the fact that overall his sins are more numerous. <b>Rav Shemaya said:</b> The other mishna serves <b>to say that if</b> one’s sins and merits <b>were</b> of <b>equal</b> balance, i.e., he has accrued an equal amount of merit and sin, one of these mitzvot <b>tilts</b> the scale in his favor.
The Gemara further asks: <b>And</b> does <b>anyone who performs one mitzva in addition to his</b> other <b>merits have goodness bestowed upon him</b> in this world? The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Anyone whose merits are greater than his sins is punished with suffering</b> in order to cleanse his sins in this world and enable him to merit full reward for his mitzvot in the World-to-Come. <b>And</b> due to this punishment <b>he appears</b> to observers <b>like one who burned the entire Torah without leaving even one letter remaining of it.</b> Conversely, <b>anyone whose sins are greater than his merits has goodness bestowed upon him</b> in this world, <b>and he appears like one who has fulfilled the entire Torah without lacking</b> the fulfillment of <b>even one letter of it.</b>
<b>Abaye said:</b> When <b>the mishna</b> said that he is rewarded, it means <b>that he has one good day and one bad day.</b> He is rewarded for the mitzvot he performs; nevertheless, occasionally he also has bad days which cleanse him of his sins, and the <i>baraita</i> is referring to those days. <b>Rava said</b> that the mishna and this <i>baraita</i> represent two different opinions. In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov, who says: There is no reward</b> for performance of <b>a mitzva in this world,</b> as one is rewarded for mitzvot only World-to-Come.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Ya’akov says: There is not a single mitzva written in the Torah whose reward</b> is stated <b>alongside it, which is not dependent on the resurrection of the dead,</b> i.e., the reward is actually bestowed in the World-to-Come, after the resurrection of the dead. How so? <b>With regard to honoring one’s father and mother it is written: “That your days may be long, and that it may go well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:16). <b>With regard to</b> the <b>dispatch</b> of the mother bird from <b>the nest it is written: “That it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:7).
Despite this, it occurred that <b>there was</b> one <b>whose father said to him: Climb to</b> the top of <b>the building and fetch me chicks. And he climbed to</b> the top of <b>the building and dispatched the mother</b> bird <b>and took the young,</b> thereby simultaneously fulfilling the mitzva to dispatch the mother bird from the nest and the mitzva to honor one’s parents, <b>but upon his return he fell and died. Where is the goodness of the days of this one, and where is the length of days of this one? Rather,</b> the verse <b>“that it may be well with you”</b> means <b>in the world where all is well, and “that your days may be long”</b> is referring <b>to the world that is entirely long.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps this</b> incident <b>never occurred?</b> It is possible that everyone who performs these mitzvot is rewarded in this world, and the situation described by Rabbi Ya’akov never happened. The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Ya’akov</b> himself <b>saw an incident</b> of this kind. The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> that man <b>was contemplating sin</b> at the time, and he was punished for his thoughts? The Gemara answers that there is a principle that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not link a bad thought to an action,</b> i.e., one is not punished for thoughts alone.
The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps he was contemplating idol worship</b> at the time, <b>and it is written</b> with regard to idol worship: <b>“So I may take the house of Israel in their own heart”</b> (Ezekiel 14:5), which indicates that one is punished for idolatrous thoughts. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Ya’akov <b>was saying this as well: If it enters your mind</b> that there is <b>reward for</b> performing <b>a mitzva in this world, why didn’t</b> these <b>mitzvot protect him so that he should not come to contemplate</b> idol worship? Since that man was not protected from thoughts of idol worship at the time, this indicates that the performance of mitzvot does not entitle one to merit reward in this world.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Elazar say</b> that <b>those on the path to perform a mitzva are not</b> susceptible to <b>harm?</b> How is it possible that this individual, who was sent by his father to perform a mitzva, could have died? The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> Rabbi Elazar is referring those <b>on their way</b> to perform a mitzva, which <b>is different,</b> as one is not susceptible to harm when he is on his way to fulfill a mitzva. In this case the individual was harmed on his return, and one is not afforded protection after having performed a mitzva.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Elazar say</b> that <b>those on the path to perform a mitzva are not</b> susceptible to <b>harm, neither</b> when they are <b>on their way</b> to perform the mitzva <b>nor when they are returning</b> from performing the mitzva? The Gemara answers: In that case it <b>was a rickety ladder,</b> and therefore <b>the danger was established; and anywhere that the danger is established one may not rely on a miracle, as it is written</b> with regard to God’s command to Samuel to anoint David as king in place of Saul: <b>“And Samuel said: How will I go, and Saul will hear and kill me;</b> and God said: Take in your hand a calf and say: I have come to sacrifice an offering to God” (I Samuel 16:2). Although God Himself issued the command, there was concern with regard to the established dangers.
<b>Rav Yosef said: Had Aḥer,</b> literally Other, the appellation of the former Sage Elisha ben Avuya, <b>interpreted this</b> aforementioned <b>verse:</b> “That it may go well with you” (Deuteronomy 5:16), <b>homiletically,</b> as referring to the World-to-Come, <b>as</b> did <b>Rabbi Ya’akov, son of his daughter,</b> he would <b>not have sinned.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> caused <b>Aḥer</b> to sin? <b>There are</b> those <b>who say he saw a case like this,</b> where a son went up to the roof on his father’s command, dispatched the mother bird, and then died. It was witnessing this episode that led Elisha ben Avuya astray.
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>he saw the tongue of Ḥutzpit the disseminator</b> after the latter was executed by the government, thrown in the street, and <b>dragged</b> along <b>by something else,</b> a euphemism for a pig. <b>He said: Shall a mouth that produced pearls lap</b> up <b>dirt?</b> For this reason <b>he went out</b> and <b>sinned.</b>
§ <b>Rav Tuvi bar Rav Kisna raises a contradiction to Rava</b> and asked: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that <b>anyone who performs one mitzva has goodness bestowed upon him.</b> This indicates that if one actually <b>performed</b> the <b>mitzva, yes,</b> he is rewarded, but if he <b>did not perform</b> the mitzva, <b>no,</b> he does not receive a reward. He <b>raises a contradiction</b> based on the following statement: If <b>one sits and does not transgress, he receives a reward as one who performs a mitzva,</b> despite the fact that he does not actually perform a mitzva. Rava <b>said to him: There,</b> when it is referring to one who sits and does not transgress, it does not mean that he was merely sitting; rather, it is speaking of a case <b>where</b> an opportunity to commit <b>a sinful act presents itself</b> to him <b>and he is saved from it.</b>
This is <b>like</b> an incident involving <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappi, who was enticed by a certain noblewoman [<i>matronita</i>]</b> to engage in sexual intercourse with her. <b>He said a formula</b> of an incantation <b>and was covered with boils and scabs</b> so as to render himself unattractive to her. <b>She performed an act</b> of magic <b>and he was healed. He fled and hid in a bathhouse</b> that was so dangerous, due to the demons that frequented the place, <b>that when two people entered</b> together <b>even during the day they would be harmed. The next day the Sages said to him: Who protected you</b> in that dangerous place? Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappi <b>said to them:</b> There were angels who appeared like <b>two</b>

Daf 40a

<b>soldiers [<i>nosei keisar</i>]</b> who <b>guarded me all night. They said to him: Perhaps a matter of forbidden intercourse presented itself to you and you were saved from it,</b> which is why a miracle occurred for you. <b>As we learned:</b> With regard to <b>anyone</b> to <b>whom a matter of forbidden intercourse presented itself to him and he was saved from it, a miracle is performed for him.</b> As it says: <b>“Mighty in strength who fulfill His word, hearkening to the voice of His word”</b> (Psalms 103:20). This is referring to one <b>such as Rabbi Tzadok and his colleagues.</b>
To what is this referring? <b>Rabbi Tzadok was enticed by a certain noblewoman</b> to engage in sexual intercourse with her. <b>He said to her: My heart is weak and I am incapable</b> at present; is <b>there something to eat</b> that can strengthen me? <b>She said to him: There is something non-kosher. He said to her: What difference is there?</b> One <b>who performs such</b> an act <b>eats such</b> food as well. <b>She lit the oven</b> and <b>placed</b> the non-kosher food <b>in it</b> to roast. <b>He climbed and sat in</b> the oven. <b>She said to him: What</b> is the meaning of <b>this? He said to her:</b> One who <b>performs this</b> act <b>falls into this,</b> i.e., the fires of Gehenna. <b>She said to him: If I had known</b> that the matter was <b>so</b> serious for you, <b>I would not have</b> caused <b>you</b> such <b>anguish.</b>
The Gemara further relates: <b>Rav Kahana would sell</b> baskets woven from <b>palm leaves</b> to women. <b>He was enticed by a certain noblewoman</b> to engage in intercourse with her. <b>He said to her:</b> Let me <b>go and adorn myself</b> beforehand. <b>He ascended</b> to the roof <b>and fell from the roof toward the ground. Elijah</b> the prophet <b>came</b> and <b>caught him.</b> Elijah the prophet <b>said to</b> Rav Kahana: <b>You have troubled me</b> to travel <b>four hundred parasangs [<i>parsei</i>]</b> to save you. Rav Kahana <b>said to him: What caused me</b> to be in this situation of temptation? Was it <b>not poverty,</b> as I am forced to engage in a trade that leads me to come into contact with women? Elijah <b>gave him a basket [<i>shifa</i>]</b> full <b>of dinars,</b> to spare him from having to work as a salesman.
§ <b>Rava raises a contradiction to Rav Naḥman</b> and asks: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 1:1): <b>These</b> are the <b>matters that a person engages in and enjoys their profits in this world, and the principal</b> reward <b>remains for him for the World-to-Come,</b> and <b>they are: Honoring one’s father and mother, acts of loving kindness, and bringing peace between one person and another; and Torah study is equal to all of them.</b>
Rava cites the source for each of these assertions. <b>With regard to honoring one’s father and mother, it is written: “That your days may be long, and that it may go well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:16), which indicates that one is rewarded in this world. <b>With regard to acts of loving kindness it is written: “He who pursues righteousness and kindness shall find life, prosperity, and honor”</b> (Proverbs 21:21), all of which apply in this world.
<b>And with regard to bringing peace it is written: “Seek peace and pursue it”</b> (Psalms 34:15). <b>And Rabbi Abbahu says:</b> This <b>is derived</b> through a verbal analogy between the term <b>pursuing</b> written with regard to pursuing peace and the term <b>pursuing</b> written in another verse. <b>It is written here: “Seek peace and pursue it,” and it is written there,</b> with regard to acts of kindness: <b>“Pursues righteousness and kindness.”</b> This teaches that one who pursues peace will also merit life, prosperity, and honor. <b>With regard to Torah study it is written: “For that is your life and the length of your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:20).
Rava asked: <b>With regard to</b> the <b>dispatch</b> of the mother bird from <b>the nest it is also written: “That it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:7), so <b>let him also teach this</b> mitzva. Rav Naḥman answered: He <b>taught</b> some cases <b>and omitted</b> others, i.e., the <i>tanna</i> did not list everything. Rava said to him: <b>The <i>tanna</i> taught: These</b> are the <b>matters,</b> which indicates that only these mitzvot are included, <b>and</b> yet <b>you say</b> that <b>he taught</b> some <b>and omitted</b> others?
Rather, <b>Rava said: Rav Idi explained</b> the matter <b>to me.</b> The verse states: <b>“Say you of the righteous who is good, that they shall eat the fruit of their actions”</b> (Isaiah 3:10). <b>And</b> this verse is difficult, as <b>is there a righteous person who is good and is there a righteous person who is not good? Rather,</b> this verse should be understood as follows: One who is <b>good</b> both <b>toward Heaven and toward people is a good righteous person;</b> one who is <b>good toward Heaven but bad toward people is a righteous person who is not good.</b>
Rava continues: <b>On a similar note,</b> it is written: <b>“Woe to the evil wicked one, for the work of his hands shall be done to him”</b> (Isaiah 3:11). <b>And is there a wicked man</b> who is <b>evil and is there</b> one <b>who is not evil? Rather,</b> one who is <b>evil toward Heaven and evil toward people is an evil wicked person;</b> and one who is <b>evil toward Heaven and not evil toward people is a wicked person who is not evil.</b> With regard to the issue at hand, only one who performs mitzvot that benefit others receives the profits of his mitzvot in this world. This does not apply to dispatching the mother bird, which is an act that does not benefit other people.
§ With regard to the mishna in <i>Pe’a</i>, the Gemara states: An act of <b>merit has a principal</b> reward <b>and it has profits,</b> i.e., one receives additional reward beyond that which is granted for the mitzva itself, parallel to a principal sum and profits, <b>as it is stated: “Say you of the righteous who is good,</b> that they shall eat the fruit of their actions” (Isaiah 3:10). <b>A sin has a principal</b> penalty <b>but it has no profits,</b> i.e., no punishment beyond that, <b>as it is stated: “Woe to the evil wicked one,</b> for the work of his hands shall be done to him” (Isaiah 3:11), but no more than the work of his hands.
<b>But how do I realize</b> the meaning of the following verse that deals with sinners: <b>“Therefore they shall eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices”</b> (Proverbs 1:31)? This verse indicates that the penalty for sin goes beyond its principal, and the wicked receive additional punishments. The Gemara answers that this applies to <b>a sin that produces profits,</b> i.e., a case where there are practical consequences to one’s sin. For example, if others learn to act in a similar manner, one’s actions <b>have profits</b> with regard to punishment as well. Conversely, a sin <b>that does not produce profits does not have profits</b> as a punishment either.
The Gemara further teaches: The Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>links a good thought to an action, as it is stated: “Then they that feared the Lord spoke one with the other, and the Lord listened, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before Him, for them that fear the Lord, and that think upon His name”</b> (Malachi 3:16). The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“and that think upon His name”? Rav Asi said: Even</b> if <b>a person intended to perform a mitzva but due to</b> circumstances <b>beyond</b> his <b>control he did not perform it, the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as if he performed</b> the mitzva, as he is among those that think upon His name.
But <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not link an evil thought to an action, as it is stated: “If I had regarded iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not hear”</b> (Psalms 66:18). <b>But how do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“Behold I will bring upon these people evil, even the fruit of their thoughts”</b> (Jeremiah 6:19)? In the case of an evil <b>thought that produces fruit,</b> i.e., that leads to an action, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, links it to</b> the <b>action</b> and one is punished for the thought as well. If it is <b>a thought that does not produce fruit, the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not link it to</b> the <b>action.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that which is written: “So I may take the house of Israel in their own heart”</b> (Ezekiel 14:5), which indicates that one can be punished for thoughts alone, to what is this verse referring? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: That is written with regard to idol worship, as the Master says: Idol worship is</b> very <b>severe, as anyone who denies it is like one who admits</b> the truth of <b>the entire Torah.</b> Conversely, one who embraces idolatry is considered to have rejected the entire Torah. Due to the severity of idol worship, one is punished even for contemplating this transgression.
<b>Ulla said:</b> This should be explained <b>in accordance with</b> a statement <b>of Rav Huna, as Rav Huna says: When a person transgresses and repeats</b> his transgression, <b>it is permitted to him.</b> The Gemara questions this statement: <b>Can it enter your mind that</b> the transgression <b>is permitted to him</b> because he has sinned twice? <b>Rather, it becomes as if</b> it were <b>permitted to him,</b> as he becomes accustomed to this behavior and no longer senses that it is a sin.
<b>Rabbi Abbahu says in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina: It is preferable for a person to transgress in secret and not to desecrate the name of Heaven in public [<i>befarhesya</i>], as it is stated: “As for you, house of Israel, so says the Lord</b> God: <b>Go you, serve everyone his idols, even because you will not hearken to Me, but My sacred name you shall not profane”</b> (Ezekiel 20:39).
<b>Rabbi Ilai the Elder says: If a person sees that his</b> evil <b>inclination is overcoming him, he should go to a place where he is not known, and wear black</b> clothes, <b>and he should cover himself in</b> simple <b>black</b> garments, <b>and he should do as his heart desires, but he should not desecrate the name of Heaven in public.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>anyone who does not care about his Creator’s honor, it is fitting for him not to have come into the world. What is this?</b> Who is considered to be one who does not care about his Creator’s honor? <b>Rabba says: This is one who gazes at a rainbow,</b> which is described as: “The likeness of the glory of the Lord” (Ezekiel 1:28). <b>Rav Yosef says: This is one who transgresses in secret,</b> which shows that he fears other people but does not care about the honor of his Creator.
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> source, which says that one who transgresses in secret does not care about his Creator’s honor, is referring <b>to one who can overcome his</b> evil <b>inclination</b> but nevertheless chooses to transgress in secret. <b>And that</b> source, which states that it is preferable for him to transgress in secret, is referring <b>to one who cannot overcome his</b> evil <b>inclination.</b>
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (see <i>Avot</i> 4:5): <b>Credit is not given with regard to the desecration of</b> God’s <b>name, whether</b> one sinned <b>unintentionally or intentionally.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>Credit is not given [<i>makkifin</i>]? Mar Zutra says:</b> This means <b>that</b> God <b>does not act like a storekeeper</b> and provide credit. Rather, one is punished without delay. <b>Mar, son of Rabbana, says:</b> This means <b>to say that if</b> one’s merit and sins <b>were equal,</b> the sin of the desecration of God’s name <b>tilts</b> the balance of the scales toward the side of his sins. In other words, if his sins include the transgression of desecrating God’s name, God does not wait for this individual to perform a mitzva to balance out the sin.
<b>The Sages taught: Always</b>

Daf 40b

<b>a person should view himself as though he were</b> exactly <b>half-liable and half-meritorious.</b> In other words he should act as though the plates of his scale are balanced, so that if <b>he performs one mitzva he is fortunate, as he tilts his</b> balance <b>to the scale of merit.</b> If <b>he transgresses one prohibition, woe to him, as he tilts his</b> balance <b>to the scale of liability, as it is stated: “But one sin destroys much good”</b> (Ecclesiastes 9:18), which means that <b>due to one sin that</b> a person <b>transgresses he squanders much good.</b>
<b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: Since the world is judged by its majority,</b> i.e., depending on whether people have performed a majority of mitzvot or a majority of sins, <b>and an individual is</b> likewise <b>judged by his majority,</b> each person must consider that if <b>he performs one mitzva he is praiseworthy, as he tilts</b> the balance of <b>himself and the entire world to the scale of merit.</b> Conversely, if <b>he transgresses one prohibition, woe to him, as he tilts</b> the balance <b>for himself and the entire world to the scale of liability, as it is stated: “But one sin</b> destroys much good,” i.e., <b>due to one sin that this</b> individual <b>commits, he squanders much goodness from himself and from the entire world.</b>
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: Even</b> if one was <b>completely righteous all his life and he rebelled</b> by sinning <b>at the end</b> of his life, <b>he loses</b> his <b>early</b> merit, <b>as it is stated: “The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him on the day of his transgression”</b> (Ezekiel 33:12). <b>And</b> similarly, <b>even</b> if one was <b>completely wicked all his life and repented in the end, he is no longer reminded of his wickedness, as it is stated</b> in the continuation of the verse: <b>“And as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not stumble over it on the day that he turns from his wickedness.”</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> an individual who performed mitzvot all of his life and then sins <b>should</b> at least <b>be like</b> one whose acts have been <b>half sins and half merits,</b> i.e., each should be of equal weight. Why, then, is he pronounced guilty? <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> This is not referring to an individual who has merely sinned but <b>to</b> one who <b>regrets all</b> the <b>initial</b> mitzvot he performed in the past. In this case the mitzvot he performed are not taken into account.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Anyone who is engaged in</b> the study of <b>Bible, and in</b> the study of <b>Mishna, and in</b> the <b>desired mode of behavior,</b> i.e., he performs labor and generally acts in an appropriate manner, <b>will not be quick to sin, as it is stated: “And a threefold cord is not quickly broken”</b> (Ecclesiastes 4:12). One who is involved in all three of these activities will not sin easily. <b>And anyone who does not engage in</b> the study of <b>Bible, nor</b> the study of <b>Mishna, nor</b> the <b>desired mode of behavior, is not part of society,</b> i.e., he is not considered a civilized person at all.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: To what are the righteous in this world compared? To a tree that is standing entirely in a pure place and its branches hang over an impure place.</b> If <b>its branches are cut, it will stand entirely in a pure place. So too, the Holy One, Blessed be He, brings afflictions upon the righteous in this world</b> to cleanse them of their few sins. He makes them suffer <b>so that they will inherit the World-to-Come</b> entirely, <b>as it is stated: “And your beginning was in pain, your end shall greatly increase”</b> (Job 8:7).
<b>And to what are the wicked in this world compared? To a tree that stands entirely in an impure place and whose branches hang over a pure place.</b> If <b>its branches are cut off, it stands entirely in an impure place. So too, the Holy One, Blessed be He, bestows good upon the wicked in this world</b> for the few mitzvot they have performed, <b>in order to expel them and banish them to the lowest level</b> of Gehenna in the future, <b>as it is stated: “There is a way which seems right to a man, but its end are the ways of death”</b> (Proverbs 14:12).
In connection to the mishna’s statement about the importance of Torah study, the Gemara relates the following incident: <b>And</b> there <b>already was</b> an incident in which <b>Rabbi Tarfon and the Elders were reclining in the loft of the house of Nit’za in Lod,</b> when <b>this question was asked of them:</b> Is <b>study greater or is action greater? Rabbi Tarfon answered and said: Action is greater. Rabbi Akiva answered and said: Study is greater. Everyone answered and said: Study is greater,</b> but not as an independent value; rather, it is greater <b>as study leads to action.</b>
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> Torah <b>study is greater, as it preceded</b> the mitzva of separating <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> by <b>forty years.</b> The Torah was given to the Jewish people soon after they left Egypt, whereas the mitzva of separating <i>ḥalla</i> came into effect only after they entered Eretz Yisrael. And it preceded the mitzva of <b><i>terumot</i> and tithes</b> by <b>fifty-four</b> years, as the Jews become obligated in these mitzvot only fourteen years after they entered Eretz Yisrael, once they had conquered and divided the land. Furthermore, the Torah preceded the observance of <b>Sabbatical</b> Years by <b>sixty-one</b> years, as they began to count the seven-year cycle only once they had divided the land. Finally, it preceded the <b>Jubilee</b> Years by <b>103</b> years, as the fifty-year count to the first Jubilee Year began only after they had divided Eretz Yisrael.
The Gemara asks: Why does the <i>baraita</i> state <b>103</b> years? <b>It was</b> actually <b>104</b> years. If one adds fifty to the fifty-four years that passed before the Jews began fulfilling the mitzvot dependent on the land, one arrives at a total of 104. The Gemara answers: This <i>tanna</i> <b>maintains</b> that <b>the Jubilee</b> Year <b>releases</b> slaves and returns fields to their original owners <b>from</b> the <b>start</b> of the year. Therefore, 103 years passed before the mitzva of the Jubilee Year took effect.
<b>And just as study</b> comes <b>before action,</b> i.e., the mitzva of Torah study takes precedence over other mitzvot, <b>so too,</b> the <b>judgment</b> concerning Torah study <b>precedes</b> the judgment for <b>an action</b> of the performance of a mitzva. This is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rav Hamnuna, as Rav Hamnuna says: The beginning of a person’s judgment is only concerning matters of Torah, as it is stated: “The beginning of judgment is as one lets out water”</b> (Proverbs 17:14). This is understood to refer to the sin of neglecting Torah, as the Torah is compared to water, which brings life to the world.
<b>And just as</b> the <b>judgment</b> concerning Torah study <b>precedes</b> the judgment for <b>an action</b> of the performance of a mitzva, <b>so too does</b> the <b>reward</b> for Torah study <b>precede</b> the reward for <b>an action</b> of the performance of a mitzva, <b>as it is stated: “And He gave them the lands of nations, and they took the labor of peoples in possession, that they might observe His statutes and protect His laws”</b> (Psalms 105:44–45). The first reward is for observing the statutes, and as explained on 37a, this is a reference to Torah study.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>anyone who does not engage in</b> the study of <b>Bible, nor</b> the study of <b>Mishna,</b> nor the desired mode of behavior, is not part of society. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And he is disqualified from bearing witness,</b> as this individual cannot be trusted. <b>The Sages taught: One who eats in the marketplace is comparable to a dog,</b> as he disrespects himself through his lack of embarrassment over eating in public. <b>And some say he is</b> even <b>disqualified from bearing witness. Rabbi Idi bar Avin said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion cited in the name of: <b>Some say.</b>
Similarly, <b>bar Kappara taught: An angry person</b>

Daf 41a

<b>has managed</b> to acquire <b>only anger [<i>ragzanuta</i>],</b> i.e., nothing beneficial comes through anger; in the end he is left with nothing but the anger itself. <b>And a good person is given the fruit of his actions to taste. And</b> with regard to <b>any</b> person <b>who does not engage in</b> the study of <b>Bible, nor</b> the study of <b>Mishna, nor</b> the <b>desired mode of behavior,</b> one should <b>vow to not</b> derive <b>benefit from him,</b> and one should have no contact with him, <b>as it is stated: “Nor sat in the seat of the scornful”</b> (Psalms 1:1). The <b>seat</b> of this person is certainly the <b>seat of the scornful,</b> as he is engaged in nothing but idle matters.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A man can betroth</b> a woman <b>by himself or by</b> means of <b>his agent.</b> Similarly, <b>a woman can become betrothed by herself or by</b> means of <b>her agent. A man can betroth his daughter</b> to a man <b>when she is a young woman,</b> either <b>by himself or by</b> means of <b>his agent.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara starts by questioning the need for the seemingly extraneous <i>halakha</i> stated in the mishna: <b>Now</b> that the mishna stated that <b>one can betroth</b> a woman <b>by</b> means of <b>his agent, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state that a man can betroth a woman <b>by himself? Rav Yosef says:</b> The mishna writes both <i>halakhot</i> to teach that although the betrothal is valid either way, it is <b>more</b> fitting that the <b>mitzva</b> be performed <b>by</b> the man <b>himself than by</b> means of <b>his agent.</b> This is <b>like that</b> story <b>of Rav Safra,</b> who <b>would</b> himself <b>singe the head</b> of an animal on Shabbat eve to prepare it to be eaten on Shabbat, and <b>Rava,</b> who <b>would salt a turbot fish</b> himself, to fulfill the mitzva to prepare for Shabbat, although this could have been done by others.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say: With regard to this</b> particular mitzva of betrothal, <b>it also involves a prohibition, in accordance with that</b> which <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says, as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: It is forbidden for a man to betroth a woman until he sees her, lest he see something repulsive in her</b> after the betrothal, <b>and she will become repugnant to him,</b> which will cause him to hate her. <b>And</b> to prevent this violation of what <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And you shall love your neighbor as yourself”</b> (Leviticus 19:18), the Sages ruled that a man must betroth a woman in person, to ensure that he approves of her.
<b>And</b> if there is a prohibition against a man betrothing a women by means of an agent, then <b>when</b> the statement of <b>Rav Yosef was stated,</b> that it is merely preferable that the betrothal be performed without an agent, <b>it was stated with regard to the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>A woman can become betrothed by herself or by</b> means of <b>her agent. Now</b> that the mishna stated that <b>she can become betrothed by</b> means of <b>her agent, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state that she can become betrothed <b>by herself?</b> It was in response to this that <b>Rav Yosef says:</b> It is <b>more</b> fitting that the <b>mitzva</b> be performed <b>by</b> the woman <b>herself than by</b> means of <b>her agent.</b> This is <b>like that</b> story <b>of Rav Safra,</b> who <b>would</b> himself <b>singe the head</b> of an animal on Shabbat eve to prepare it to be eaten on Shabbat, and <b>Rava,</b> who <b>would</b> himself <b>salt a turbot fish.</b>
<b>But in this</b> case of a woman who appoints an agent, <b>there is no prohibition, as that</b> which <b>Reish Lakish</b> said. <b>As Reish Lakish said:</b> Women have a saying: <b>It is better to sit</b> as <b>two bodies,</b> i.e., be married, <b>than to sit</b> lonely like <b>a widow.</b> Once a woman has decided to marry, she will accept any husband whose betrothal her agent accepts on her behalf, and there is no concern that she will find her betrothed repulsive and violate the mitzva of loving one’s neighbor like oneself.
The mishna teaches: <b>A man can betroth his daughter</b> to a man <b>when she is a young woman.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>When she is a young woman, yes,</b> he can betroth her; <b>when she is a minor, no,</b> he cannot betroth her. This statement <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say</b> it was said by <b>Rabbi Elazar: It is prohibited for a person to betroth his daughter</b> to a man <b>when she is a minor, until</b> such time <b>that she grows up and says: I want</b> to marry <b>so-and-so.</b> If a father betroths his daughter when she is a minor and incapable of forming an opinion of the husband, she may later find herself married to someone she does not like.
§ The mishna states that an agent has the power to effect betrothal. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that there is halakhic <b>agency?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states with regard to one who divorces his wife: “That he writes her a bill of divorce, and gives it in her hand, and sends her [<i>veshilleḥah</i>] out of his house” (Deuteronomy 24:1). The verse employs the verb: <b>And he sends [<i>veshillaḥ</i>].</b> The fact that the verse employs the term <i>veshillaḥ</i>, as opposed to another verb denoting divorce, <i>vegereshah</i>, <b>teaches that he can appoint an agent [<i>shaliaḥ</i>],</b> as both words share the root <i>shin</i>, <i>lamed</i>, <i>ḥet</i>. The husband does not have to personally give his wife the bill of divorce.
Additionally, the fact that the term <b>“and he sends her [<i>veshilleḥah</i>]”</b> can also be read as: And she sends [<i>veshalleḥa</i>], <b>teaches that she</b> too <b>can appoint an agent</b> to accept her bill of divorce. Furthermore, in this same passage the verb is repeated in the phrases <b>“and he sends,” “and he sends her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1–3), which serves to <b>teach that an agent can appoint another agent.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for agency <b>with regard to divorce; from where do we</b> derive that there is agency <b>with regard to betrothal? And if you would say that</b> it <b>is derived from divorce,</b> i.e., just as a wife can be divorced from her husband by means of an agent, she can become betrothed to him in the same way, the two cases are not similar: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about divorce is that it</b> can be effected <b>against her will,</b> while betrothal cannot. Therefore, a means of effecting divorce cannot necessarily be used to effect betrothal. The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states: “And she departs</b> out of his house, and goes <b>and becomes</b> another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2). Because the verse <b>juxtaposes becoming</b> married <b>to leaving</b> a marriage, <b>just as</b> a husband can <b>appoint an agent</b> for the purpose of <b>leaving</b> a marriage, <b>so too he</b> can <b>appoint an agent</b> for the purpose of <b>becoming</b> married.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> there is <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 4:4): In the case of <b>one who says to his agent: Go out</b> and <b>separate <i>teruma</i></b> from my field’s produce for me, the agent <b>must separate</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>in accordance with the mindset of the owner.</b> He must separate the amount that he assumes the owner would want to give, as there is no fixed measure for the amount that one must set aside as <i>teruma</i>. A generous person would give as much as one-fortieth of the produce as <i>teruma</i>, while a stingy person would give one-sixtieth. <b>And if he does not know the mindset of the owner, he separates an intermediate</b> measure, which is <b>one-fiftieth</b> of the produce.

Daf 41b

<b>If</b> the agent <b>subtracted ten</b> from the denominator and separated one-fortieth <b>or added ten</b> to the denominator and separated one-sixtieth, thereby giving more or less than the owner intended, <b>his <i>teruma</i> is <i>teruma</i>. From where do we</b> derive that one can appoint an agent to separate <i>teruma</i>? <b>And if you would say that</b> it <b>is derived from divorce,</b> one could argue: <b>What</b> is an aspect unique <b>to divorce is that it is</b> considered <b>a non-sacred</b> matter in relation to <i>teruma</i> and will have different <i>halakhot</i>, so one cannot learn from divorce that one can appoint an agent to separate <i>teruma</i>. The Gemara answers: The verse states with regard to <i>teruma</i>: “So you also shall set apart a gift unto the Lord of all your tithes” (Numbers 18:28). Once the <b>verse states “you,”</b> the addition of the word “also” in the term <b>“you also”</b> serves <b>to include an agent.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And let the Merciful One write in</b> the passage concerning <b><i>teruma</i></b> that one can appoint an agent, <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> that one can appoint an agent to act on his behalf in <b>these</b> other areas matters, i.e., divorce and betrothal, <b>can come and be derived from it.</b> The Gemara answers: Agency in these matters cannot be derived in this manner <b>because</b> the derivation <b>can be refuted:</b> Separating <i>teruma</i> is different, in <b>that it is</b> able to be separated <b>by</b> mere <b>thought.</b> It is enough for one to decide that a certain portion of his produce shall be <i>teruma</i> to have that status take effect. Just as there is this leniency unique to separating <i>teruma</i>, perhaps the leniency that enables one to appoint an agent is also unique to separating <i>teruma</i>.
The Gemara further clarifies the source for agency: Generally, the Paschal offering was brought by a group of people together. <b>But</b> there is <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 98b): In the case of <b>a group whose Paschal offering was lost</b> before it was sacrificed, <b>and they said to one</b> member of the group: <b>Go and search</b> for our Paschal offering, <b>and</b> when you find it, <b>slaughter</b> it <b>on our</b> behalf; <b>and</b> this person <b>went and found</b> the lost animal <b>and slaughtered</b> it on behalf of the entire group, <b>but</b> meanwhile, despairing of his return, <b>they took</b> a different animal <b>and slaughtered</b> it as a Paschal offering, the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: <b>If his</b> Paschal offering <b>was slaughtered first, he eats from his</b> offering, <b>and they eat and drink with him.</b> This demonstrates that one can act as an agent to slaughter the Paschal offering.
<b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>, that one can appoint an agent to slaughter an offering? <b>And if you would say that</b> it <b>is derived from these</b> other instances of agency, i.e., divorce and <i>teruma</i>, one could refute this derivation by saying: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about these is that they are</b> considered <b>non-sacred</b> matters <b>relative to offerings,</b> and perhaps offerings have their own set of <i>halakhot</i>.
The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> that <b>which Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa</b> says, <b>as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the legal status of <b>a person’s agent is like</b> that of <b>himself? As it is stated</b> with regard to the Paschal offering: <b>“And the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall slaughter it in the afternoon”</b> (Exodus 12:6). <b>Is it so</b> that <b>the whole assembly slaughters</b> the offering? <b>But only one</b> person from each group <b>slaughters</b> it. <b>Rather,</b> it can be derived <b>from here that</b> the legal status of <b>a person’s agent is like</b> that of <b>himself.</b>
In light of that exposition, the Gemara asks: <b>Let the Merciful One write</b> in the Torah the <i>halakha</i> of an agent <b>with regard to offerings, and these,</b> i.e., agency in the cases of betrothal, divorce, and <i>teruma</i>, <b>can come and be derived from it.</b> The Gemara answers: Agency in these matters cannot be derived in this manner <b>because</b> the derivation <b>can be refuted: What</b> is unique <b>about offerings</b> is that the <b>majority of their actions</b> are performed <b>by</b> means of <b>an agent.</b> Since most of the sacrificial service is performed by priests, who serve as the agents of those bringing the offerings, the general <i>halakha</i> of agency cannot be derived from there.
The Gemara continues to ask: For the reasons stated, the <i>halakha</i> of agency <b>cannot be derived</b> for any <b>one</b> of these <b>from</b> any other <b>one</b> of them. Still, <b>derive one</b> of these <b>from</b> the other <b>two.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>Which</b> of them will be <b>derived</b> from the others?
If you say: <b>Let the Merciful One not write</b> the <i>halakha</i> of agency <b>with regard to offerings and derive</b> agency with regard to offerings <b>from these,</b> i.e., divorce and <i>teruma</i>, that derivation can be refuted: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about these is that they are</b> considered <b>non-sacred</b> matters <b>relative to offerings,</b> as even <i>teruma</i> is not sacred compared to offerings, and sacred procedures such as offerings may have their own <i>halakhot</i>. If you say: <b>Let the Merciful One not write</b> the <i>halakha</i> of agency <b>with regard to divorce, and derive</b> agency with regard to divorce <b>from these,</b> i.e., <i>teruma</i> and offerings, this too can be refuted: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about these is they can be</b> designated <b>by means of thought,</b> and therefore may be easier to effect than divorce.
<b>Rather,</b> it is the third derivation that is possible: <b>Let the Merciful One not write</b> the <i>halakha</i> of agency <b>with regard to <i>teruma</i>, and derive</b> agency <b>from these,</b> i.e., offerings and divorce. Although <i>teruma</i> is sacred, offerings are more sacred, and yet the <i>halakha</i> of agency applies to them. Although the separating of <i>teruma</i> can be accomplished by means of thought, as opposed to divorce, offerings can also be designated by means of thought. The Gemara answers: It is <b>indeed</b> so; this is the derivation for the applicability of agency to <i>teruma</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> then <b>why do I</b> need the derivation that once the verse states <b>“you,”</b> the addition of the word “also” in the term <b>“you also”</b> serves to include an agent? The Gemara answers: It <b>is necessary to</b> function as the source of <b>the</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Yannai, as Rabbi Yannai says</b> that from the term <b>“you also,”</b> the following is derived: <b>Just as you,</b> those who appoint agents, <b>are members of the covenant,</b> i.e., Jews, <b>so too, your agents</b> must be <b>members of the covenant.</b> A gentile cannot separate <i>teruma</i> even if appointed as an agent by a Jew.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> to teach <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>It</b> is <b>derived from that</b> which <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> says that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says, as Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: A slave cannot become an agent to receive a bill of divorce from the hand of a woman’s husband</b> on her behalf <b>because he is not</b> included <b>in the laws of bills of divorce and betrothal.</b> This indicates that there is a principle that if certain matters do not apply to a person, he cannot act as an agent with regard to those matters. Therefore, since gentiles are not commanded to separate <i>teruma</i>, they cannot be agents for its separation.
The Gemara answers: It <b>was</b> nevertheless <b>necessary</b> to derive this <i>halakha</i> for the case of <i>teruma</i>, because it cannot be derived from the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan. This is as it might <b>enter your mind to say:</b> It is <b>a slave</b> who cannot serve as an agent to receive a bill of divorce, <b>since he cannot release</b> a woman by divorce <b>at all; but a gentile, since he is included in his own <i>teruma</i>, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 3:9): <b>A gentile or a Samaritan who separated <i>teruma</i></b> from their own produce, <b>their <i>teruma</i> is considered <i>teruma</i>,</b> despite the fact that they are not obligated to do so, <b>I will say</b> that he can <b>also be</b> appointed as an <b>agent.</b> To counter this argument, the term “you also” <b>teaches us</b> that only members of the covenant can act as agents for separating <i>teruma</i>; gentiles cannot.
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to Rabbi Shimon, who exempts</b> one from paying an additional penalty for the <i>teruma</i> of a gentile, this explanation cannot be stated. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 3:9): If <b>the <i>teruma</i> of a gentile</b> gets mixed with regular produce, it is considered to be <b>a mixture of</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>and non-sacred</b> produce, <b>and</b> if a non-priest eats this mixture unwittingly <b>he is liable</b> to pay <b>for it</b> an additional <b>one-fifth</b> beyond its value, just as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to one who unwittingly eats <i>teruma</i>. <b>But Rabbi Shimon exempts</b> him from paying the additional one-fifth, as he holds that the <i>teruma</i> of a gentile possesses no sanctity and is considered a mere gift to a priest. If so, if there is no need to learn the additional <i>halakha</i> that a gentile cannot act as an agent with regard to the separating of <i>teruma</i>, <b>why do I</b> need the derivation from <b>“you”</b> and <b>“you also”?</b>
The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary</b> to state this additional term, as it might <b>enter your mind to say: Since the Master says</b> that the word “you” is interpreted as a limitation, it means that <b>“you,” but not sharecroppers,</b> can separate <i>teruma</i>, as a sharecropper cannot separate <i>teruma</i> from the produce of the owner of the field; <b>“you”</b> can separate <i>teruma</i> <b>but not partners</b> from shared property without the consent of the other; <b>“you”</b> can separate <i>teruma</i> <b>but not a steward [<i>apotropos</i>]</b> from the estate that he is administering; and <b>“you”</b> can separate <i>teruma</i> <b>but not one who separates</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>from</b> produce <b>that is not his,</b> you might <b>also say: “You”</b> can separate <i>teruma</i> <b>and not your agents.</b> The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that “you also” indicates that one can appoint an agent to separate <i>teruma</i>.
The Gemara poses a question with regard to the basic derivation of the <i>halakha</i> of agency: <b>This works out well</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa,</b> who explains that the verse: “And the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall slaughter it in the afternoon” (Exodus 12:6), teaches the <i>halakha</i> of agency with regard to offerings. <b>But</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yonatan, who derives a different exposition from this verse, from where do we</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> of agency with regard to offerings? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: From where do we</b> derive that <b>all of the Jews can fulfill</b> their obligations

Daf 42a

<b>with one Paschal offering?</b> Although it is impossible for all of the Jewish people to each eat an olive-bulk from one offering, they nevertheless fulfill their obligation to sacrifice the Paschal offering by sacrificing one animal, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the Paschal offering: <b>“And the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall slaughter it in the afternoon”</b> (Exodus 12:6). <b>Is it so that the whole assembly slaughters</b> it? <b>But only one</b> person from each group <b>slaughters. Rather,</b> it can be derived <b>from here that all of the Jews can fulfill</b> their obligations <b>with one Paschal</b> offering, despite the fact that not everyone will be able to eat from it. Since Rabbi Yonatan derives from this verse that one offering suffices, <b>from where does he</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> of <b>agency with regard to offerings?</b>
The Gemara answers: He derives it <b>from that</b> very same verse, as it can be seen that one person slaughters the animal on behalf of the rest of the assembly. The Gemara rejects this: <b>But perhaps it is different there, since</b> the one slaughtering the animal <b>has partnership with them</b> in the offering. This does not prove that there is agency when the agent has no share in the offering.
<b>Rather,</b> he derives agency with regard to offerings <b>from here: “And they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers’ houses, a lamb for a household”</b> (Exodus 12:3). This demonstrates that one person takes a lamb and slaughters it on behalf of the entire family. The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps there too</b> there is agency <b>since</b> the one slaughtering the animal <b>has partnership with them?</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>If so, why do I</b> need <b>two verses</b> to teach the same <i>halakha</i>? <b>If</b> the <i>halakha</i> stated in this verse <b>is not applicable for where it belongs,</b> i.e., with regard to an agent who is a partner in the offering, <b>apply it to where it does not belong,</b> so that even one who does not have a share in the offering can act as an agent.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>This</b> verse <b>is required for him to</b> teach another <i>halakha</i>, <b>that of Rabbi Yitzḥak, as Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> This verse is the source for the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a man,</b> i.e., an adult, <b>can acquire</b> an item on behalf of others, <b>but</b> that <b>a minor cannot acquire</b> an item on behalf of others. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i>, that only an adult can acquire an item on behalf of others, <b>is derived from</b> the verse: <b>“According to every man’s eating</b> you shall make your count for the lamb” (Exodus 12:4). By employing the term “man,” which indicates an adult, the verse teaches that only an adult can acquire an item on behalf of others.
The Gemara asks another question: <b>And still</b> the verse “according to every man’s eating” <b>is required for him</b> to teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>that one may slaughter a Paschal offering for an individual.</b> It does not have to be “a lamb, according to their fathers’ houses,” as implied by the previous verse. A lamb may be slaughtered even by one person, i.e., “every man” for himself. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yonatan <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says</b> that <b>one may not slaughter a Paschal offering for an individual.</b>
The Gemara asks a question from a different source: <b>But</b> consider <b>that</b> which <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the legal status of <b>a person’s agent is like</b> that of <b>himself?</b> It is <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the division of Eretz Yisrael among the Jewish people: <b>“And you shall take one prince of every tribe,</b> to take possession of the land” (Numbers 34:18). This indicates that the prince of each tribe acted as the agent to claim the land for each member of his tribe. <b>Let</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>agency be derived from here;</b> why is there a need to have the sources quoted above? The Gemara answers: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand that this</b> process of the princes claiming the land <b>was</b> due to <b>agency? But minors cannot be</b> involved in <b>agency,</b> and the princes claimed the land for all members of their tribe, adults and minors alike.
<b>Rather,</b> the distribution of the land by the princes follows a different principle, <b>like that</b> statement <b>of Rava bar Rav Huna, as Rava bar Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one can act in a person’s interest in his absence?</b> It is <b>as</b> it <b>is stated: “And</b> you shall take <b>one prince.”</b> The princes were not appointed as agents and could act for the benefit of the minors. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> that <b>it is a benefit? But it was also</b> to their <b>disadvantage, as there is</b> one person <b>for whom it is preferable to him</b> to receive a portion <b>on a hill and it is not preferable to him</b> to receive a portion <b>in a valley, and there is</b> one person <b>for whom it is preferable to him</b> to receive a portion <b>in a valley and it is not preferable to him</b> to receive a portion <b>on a hill.</b> The prince might claim land for members of his tribe that they do not want, and one cannot act to another’s disadvantage in his absence.
<b>Rather,</b> the verse is required to teach a different <i>halakha</i>, <b>like that</b> statement <b>of Rava bar Rav Huna, as Rava bar Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> if <b>orphans came to divide their father’s property, that the court appoints a steward for them,</b> both <b>to</b> their <b>disadvantage and to</b> their <b>benefit?</b> Before the Gemara completes the quote, it analyzes the statement: <b>Why</b> would the court appoint a steward <b>to</b> their <b>disadvantage? Rather,</b> it means <b>to</b> their <b>disadvantage in order to</b> achieve their eventual <b>benefit.</b> Once a steward has been appointed to control the orphans’ estate, he has the authority to act to their temporary disadvantage if they are ultimately likely to benefit from the action. And the source of this <i>halakha</i> is as <b>the verse states: “And you shall take one prince of every tribe”</b> (Numbers 34:18).
§ With regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of stewardship, <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If <b>orphans came to divide their father’s property, the court appoints</b> a steward <b>for them, and they select for them,</b> i.e., for each of the orphans, <b>a fine portion. And when they have grown up,</b> the orphans <b>can protest</b> the division and demand redistribution of the property. <b>And Rav Naḥman said his own</b> statement: <b>When they have grown up, they cannot protest, as if so, what advantage</b> is there to <b>the power of the court</b> over an ordinary person? In other words, to strengthen the authority of the court, it is required that its decisions not be questioned later on.
The Gemara asks: <b>And is Rav Naḥman of</b> the opinion that there is a consideration of: <b>If so, what advantage</b> does <b>the court have</b> over an ordinary person? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 99b): The <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the appraisal by the judges</b> of the value of a piece of property in order to sell it is as follows: <b>Where they decreased</b> the price by <b>one-sixth</b> of its market value <b>or added one-sixth</b> to its market value, <b>their sale is void. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Their sale is valid. And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: If so,</b> if the sale is void, then <b>what advantage</b> is there to <b>the power of the court</b> over an ordinary person? <b>And Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with the statement of the Rabbis.</b> This indicates that Rav Naḥman does not accept the consideration of: What advantage is there to the power of the court over an ordinary person?
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult.</b>

Daf 42b

In <b>this</b> case, where Rav Naḥman ruled that their transaction is void, in accordance with the Rabbis, the court <b>erred</b> by one-sixth. But in <b>that</b> case, where Rav Naḥman ruled that the orphans cannot protest when they grow up, <b>they did not err</b> by one-sixth. The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> Rav Naḥman’s ruling that the orphans cannot protest is referring to a case <b>where they did not err</b> by one-sixth, <b>why</b> did Shmuel say that <b>they can</b> later <b>protest;</b> what is the nature of their protest? The Gemara answers: <b>They can protest with regard to</b> the <b>locations.</b> One of the orphans can contend that he prefers property in a different location than he was given.
§ <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> With regard to <b>brothers who divided</b> property received as an inheritance, <b>they are</b> considered <b>like</b> they are <b>purchasers</b> from each other, and the <i>halakhot</i> of fraud are like those for regular transactions: If there was an error of <b>less than one-sixth</b> in the distribution, the <b>transaction is acquired,</b> i.e., valid. If it was <b>more than one-sixth,</b> the <b>transaction is void.</b> If the error was precisely <b>one-sixth,</b> it is <b>acquired, and</b> the one who received more than his fair share <b>must return</b> the amount of the <b>fraud.</b>
<b>Rava says: That which we said,</b> that with regard to <b>less than one-sixth</b> the <b>transaction</b> is valid and the item <b>is acquired, we said only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the brother receiving a smaller share <b>did not appoint an agent</b> to deal with the distribution on his behalf. <b>But if</b> the brother receiving a smaller share <b>appointed an agent,</b> this <i>halakha</i> does not apply, as the one who appointed the agent can <b>say: I sent you to</b> act for <b>my benefit and not to my detriment.</b> The agent’s right to act in this capacity did not extend to a case where it was to the detriment of the one who appointed him.
Rava continues: <b>And that which we said,</b> that if the brothers erred by <b>more than one-sixth</b> the <b>transaction is void, we said only when</b> the brother receiving a smaller share <b>did not say: Let us divide</b> the estate <b>by an appraisal of the court. But</b> if <b>he said: Let us divide</b> it <b>by an appraisal of the court, the transaction is valid, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 99b): This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the appraisal</b> of an article’s value in order to sell it, as done by <b>the judges:</b> In a case <b>where they decreased</b> the price by <b>one-sixth</b> of its market value <b>or added one-sixth</b> to its market value, <b>their sale is void. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Their sale is valid.</b>
Rava continues: <b>And that which we said,</b> that if the brothers erred by <b>one-sixth</b> the one receiving a larger share <b>acquired</b> it <b>and he must return</b> the amount of the <b>fraud, we said only with regard to movable property. But with regard to land,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>there is no fraud with regard to land. And with regard to land, we said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of fraud does not apply <b>only when they divided</b> it <b>according to the value</b> of the land. <b>But</b> if <b>they divided</b> it <b>by measure</b> and erred in the measurement, we do <b>not</b> say that there is no fraud. This is in accordance <b>with</b> the statement <b>of Rabba, as Rabba said: Any matter that is according to measure, or according to weight, or according to number,</b> if it turned out to be in error, <b>even</b> if the error was <b>less than the amount</b> that constitutes <b>fraud,</b> it <b>is also returned.</b>
§ The Gemara returns to discuss various aspects of agency. <b>And</b> there is a difficulty from <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 59b): In the case of <b>one who sends</b> an item that causes <b>a fire in the hands of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor,</b> the one who sent it <b>is exempt according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven.</b> If <b>he sent</b> it <b>in the hands of</b> a halakhically <b>competent person,</b> only <b>the</b> halakhically <b>competent person is liable.</b>
<b>But why</b> is the halakhically competent person liable? <b>Let us say</b> that the legal status of <b>a person’s agent is like</b> that of <b>himself.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There</b> it <b>is different, as there is no agency for transgression, as we say:</b> When there is a conflict between <b>the words of the Master,</b> i.e., God, <b>and the words of</b> the <b>student,</b> i.e., a human being, <b>whose words</b> should be <b>listened to?</b> Consequently, the agent is considered to have acted of his own accord, and the one who sent him bears no responsibility.
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> there is a difficulty from <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse of consecrated property: In the case of <b>an agent who did not perform his agency</b> but deviated from the instructions of the one who appointed him and made use of consecrated property, the <b>agent has misused</b> consecrated property and is liable to bring the guilt-offering for that sin. In the case of an agent who <b>performed his agency, the owner has misused</b> consecrated property and is liable to bring the offering. The Gemara asks: The <i>baraita</i> states that <b>when</b> the agent <b>performed the agency of the owner, the owner</b> has <b>in any event misused</b> consecrated property. <b>Why? Let us say</b> that <b>there is no agency for transgression.</b>
The Gemara answers: The case of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>is different, as</b> it <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy of <b>“sin”</b> in this case and <b>“sin” from <i>teruma</i>,</b> as the verse states: “And sin through error” (Leviticus 5:15), with regard to misuse of consecrated property, and it states: “Lest they bear sin for it” (Leviticus 22:9) with regard to <i>teruma</i>: <b>Just as</b> with <b><i>teruma</i></b> one can <b>appoint an agent, so too</b> with <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property one can <b>appoint an agent,</b> although the latter is a transgression.
The Gemara suggests: <b>And let us derive</b> a principle <b>from</b> misuse of consecrated property, that one can appoint an agent even to perform a transgression. The Gemara explains: This is not done <b>because misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>and misappropriation</b> of a deposit, i.e., a bailee using an item that was deposited with him, <b>are two verses that come as one,</b> i.e., they teach the same matter, that an agent can be appointed to perform a transgression. <b>And any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> their common aspect to apply to other cases. The Gemara clarifies this statement: The verse pertaining to <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>is that which we said,</b> but <b>what is</b> the verse pertaining to <b>misappropriation?</b>
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah uses the inclusive term “every” with regard to one suspected of misappropriating a deposit: <b>“For every matter of trespass”</b> (Exodus 22:8). <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> This inclusive term “every” serves <b>to render</b> one <b>liable for</b> speech and <b>thought,</b> i.e., intent to misappropriate, <b>like action. And Beit Hillel say: One is liable only if he</b> actually <b>misappropriates it, as</b> it <b>is stated: “Whether he has not put his hand</b> unto his neighbor’s goods” (Exodus 22:7).
<b>Beit Shammai said to Beit Hillel: But isn’t it stated: “For every matter of trespass,”</b> which indicates that one is liable without actually misappropriating the deposit? <b>Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai: But isn’t it stated: “Whether he has not put his hand unto his neighbor’s goods”? Beit Shammai said to Beit Hillel: If so,</b> if one is liable only for actual misappropriation, <b>why do I</b> need: <b>“For every matter of trespass”?</b> Beit Hillel replied: It is necessary, <b>as</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>I have</b> derived liability <b>only</b> if <b>he</b> himself misappropriated it; <b>from where</b> do I derive that he is liable also if he <b>told his slave or his agent</b> to do so? <b>The verse states: “For every matter of trespass,”</b> to teach that the bailee is liable if one acting on his behalf misappropriates the deposit.
The Gemara explains further: <b>This</b> answer, that misuse of consecrated property and misappropriation are two verses that come to teach the same matter, <b>works out well</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel. But</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, who establish this verse</b> as rendering one liable <b>for thought like action</b> and do not learn from here that the bailee is liable if one acting on his behalf misappropriates the deposit,

Daf 43a

<b>let us derive</b> a principle from misuse of consecrated property, that an agent can be appointed to perform a transgression. The Gemara answers: This is not done, <b>because misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>and</b> the <b>slaughter or sale</b> of a stolen cow or sheep <b>are two verses that come as one, and any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> their common aspect to apply to other cases. The Gemara clarifies: The verse pertaining to <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property is <b>that which we said,</b> but <b>what is</b> the verse with regard to <b>slaughter or sale? The verse states: “And he slaughters it or sells it”</b> (Exodus 21:37), juxtaposing selling to slaughtering: <b>Just as a sale</b> is necessarily performed <b>by means of another,</b> since every transaction involves two parties, <b>so too slaughter</b> can likewise be performed <b>by means of another,</b> and the thief is liable even if the act of slaughtering is performed by his agent.
The Gemara quotes two other explanations. <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> that the word <b>“or”</b> in the verse “and he slaughters it or sells it,” serves <b>to include an agent. The school of Ḥizkiyya taught:</b> When the verse states with regard to sale or slaughter: “He shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep” (Exodus 21:37), repetition of the word <b>“for”</b> is superfluous and serves <b>to include an agent.</b> It teaches that the one who appointed the agent is liable for the action of the agent.
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who said</b> that <b>two verses that come as one do not teach</b> a precedent that applies to other cases, <b>but according to the one who said</b> that two verses do <b>teach</b> a precedent, <b>what can be said?</b> Why not derive from the case of misuse of consecrated property and that of slaughter or sale that an agent can be appointed to perform a transgression? The Gemara answers: <b>The Merciful One reveals</b> in the Torah that an agent cannot be appointed to perform a transgression <b>in</b> the case of an offering <b>slaughtered outside</b> the Temple, as it states: <b>“It shall be considered blood for that [<i>hahu</i>] man; he has spilled blood”</b> (Leviticus 17:4). The emphasis of “that man” teaches that <b>he</b> is liable for his actions, <b>but</b> he is <b>not</b> liable for the actions of <b>his agent.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that an agent cannot be appointed to perform a transgression <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition of offerings <b>slaughtered outside. From where do we</b> derive that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>to the entire Torah?</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>derived</b> as a principle <b>from</b> the case of offerings <b>slaughtered outside,</b> by means of analogy.
The Gemara asks: But <b>before deriving</b> that an agent cannot be appointed to perform a transgression <b>from</b> the case of offerings <b>slaughtered outside, let us derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from these</b> other cases, i.e., misuse of consecrated property and slaughter or sale, where the <i>halakha</i> is that an agent can be appointed to perform a transgression. The Gemara answers: <b>The Merciful One again writes</b> in that same verse in connection to the prohibition of slaughtering offerings outside the Temple: <b>“And that [<i>hahu</i>] man shall be cut off</b> from among his people” (Leviticus 17:4). <b>If</b> the <i>halakha</i> derived from the emphasis of the word <i>hahu</i> written in this part of the verse <b>is not needed for</b> this <b>matter itself,</b> since the verse already taught that he is liable only for his own act and not for that of his agent, <b>apply it to the matter of the entire Torah,</b> so that one is held liable only for one’s own actions and not for those of an agent.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that <b>two verses that come as one do not teach</b> a precedent, and there is no reason to learn from the misuse of consecrated property and slaughter or sale that one can appoint an agent to perform a transgression, <b>what does he interpret those</b> terms: <b>“That</b> man” and: <b>“That</b> man” to be teaching? Since he does not need to counter a derivation from the two verses, he should not require them to teach that one cannot appoint an agent to perform a transgression. The Gemara answers: <b>One</b> of them serves <b>to exclude</b> from liability the case of <b>two who hold a knife and slaughter</b> an offering outside together. <b>And</b> the other <b>one</b> emphasizes: <b>“That</b> man” is liable, <b>but not one</b> who is <b>compelled</b> to slaughter the animal; <b>“that</b> man” is liable, <b>but not</b> one who does so <b>unwittingly;</b> and <b>“that</b> man” is liable, <b>and not</b> one who <b>was mistaken,</b> e.g., one who did not know that the animal was an offering. In order to be liable one must have acted with full awareness and completely willingly.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>the other</b> opinion, i.e., the one who holds that two verses that come as one do teach a precedent, which derives from the word “that [<i>hahu</i>]” that an agent cannot be appointed to perform a transgression, derive these <i>halakhot</i>? The Gemara answers: He derives them from the fact that the pronoun “<i>hahu</i>” is composed of two parts, the article <i>ha</i>, meaning: The, and the pronoun <i>hu</i>, meaning: He. He derives <i>halakhot</i> both <b>from “<i>hu</i>”</b> and from the additional article in <b>“<i>hahu</i>.”</b> Therefore, he is able to derive both the principle that an agent cannot be appointed to perform a transgression and the <i>halakhot</i> of two that slaughter and one who acts without full awareness. <b>And the other</b> opinion, i.e., the one who holds that two verses that come as one do not teach a precedent, which derives these <i>halakhot</i> from the entire word “<i>hahu</i>,” <b>does not interpret</b> the variation from <b>“<i>hu</i>”</b> to <b>“<i>hahu</i>.”</b> He holds that one cannot derive separate <i>halakhot</i> from each part of this word.
The Gemara questions the statement that there is no agency for transgressions: <b>But</b> there is <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who says to his agent: Go kill a person, he,</b> the killer, <b>is liable</b> if he kills, <b>and the one who appointed him is exempt. Shammai the Elder says in the name of Haggai the prophet: The one who appointed him is liable, as it stated</b> with regard to David, who directed Joab to kill Uriah: <b>“Him you have slain with the sword of the children of Ammon”</b> (II Samuel 12:9). David was held responsible for the death of Uriah.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of Shammai the Elder?</b> How can he say that there is agency for transgression? The Gemara answers: <b>He holds</b> that <b>two verses that come as one do teach</b> a precedent, and therefore he learns from the two cases of misuse of consecrated property and slaughter or sale that there is agency for transgression. <b>And</b> as for the derivation from one who slaughters an offering outside the Temple, which teaches that there is no agent for transgression, Shammai <b>does not interpret</b> the variation from <b>“<i>hu</i>”</b> to <b>“<i>hahu</i>.” And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually</b> it is possible that he does <b>interpret</b> the variation, and he agrees that there is no agent for transgression. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of Shammai’s statement that the one who appoints him is <b>liable?</b> It means he is <b>liable according to the laws of Heaven,</b> although he cannot be punished by a human court.
The Gemara asks: <b>By inference,</b> does this mean <b>that the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>he is exempt even according to the laws of Heaven?</b> The one who appointed him must bear some responsibility. <b>Rather,</b> the first <i>tanna</i> also agrees that the one who appointed the killer is liable according to the laws of Heaven, and <b>the</b> difference <b>between them</b> pertains to <b>a great judgment and a small judgment.</b> According to Shammai, his liability is great, to the extent that Heaven considers him fully responsible, whereas the first <i>tanna</i> holds that his liability is of a lesser degree.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: Everyone agrees that there is no agent for transgression. Nevertheless, Shammai holds that <b>there,</b> with regard to killing, it <b>is different, since the Merciful One reveals: “Him you have slain with the sword of the children of Ammon,”</b> explicitly rendering David accountable for this transgression and indicating that killing is different from all other transgressions.
<b>And the other</b> opinion, i.e., the first <i>tanna</i>, who holds that the one who appoints the killer is exempt, explains the verse as follows: <b>Behold</b> this killing is <b>for you like the sword of Ammon. Just as you are not punished</b> for those killed by <b>the sword of Ammon</b> in the course of the war, <b>so too you are not punished for</b> the death of <b>Uriah the Hittite,</b> not even according to the laws of Heaven. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? Uriah <b>was a rebel against the monarchy</b> and was consequently liable to the death penalty, <b>as he said to</b> King David: <b>“And my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field”</b> (II Samuel 11:11). By referring to Joab as his lord in front of the king, he indicated that he answered to Joab rather than to the king, which is tantamount to rebellion.
<b>Rava said: If you say</b> that <b>Shammai holds</b> that <b>two verses that come as one do teach</b> a precedent, <b>and he does not interpret</b> the variation from <b>“<i>hu</i>”</b> to <b>“<i>hahu</i>,”</b> the combination of which would result in him holding that there is agency for transgression in all cases, even he <b>concedes with regard to one who says to his agent: Go and engage in sexual intercourse with a forbidden relative,</b> or: Go <b>and eat</b> forbidden <b>fat, that</b> the agent <b>is liable and the one who appointed him is exempt, as we have not found in the entire Torah</b> a case where <b>this</b> person physically <b>benefits</b> from the transgression <b>but that</b> one <b>becomes liable.</b>
§ <b>It was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> engaged in a dispute concerning the following issue: <b>Rav says: An agent can become a witness.</b> If one was appointed as an agent to perform a certain task, he can then serve as a witness that the action was performed. <b>In the school of Rabbi Sheila they say: An agent cannot become a witness.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of the school of Rabbi Sheila? If we say</b> it is <b>because</b> the one who appointed him <b>did not say to</b> the agent: <b>Be a witness for me,</b> and appointed him only as an agent; <b>if that is so,</b> if one <b>betrothed a woman in the presence of two</b> people <b>and did not say to them: You are my witnesses, so too</b> would they hold <b>that it is not a betrothal?</b> It is not necessary to explicitly appoint witnesses.
<b>Rather,</b> the dispute is as follows. <b>Rav says: An agent can become a witness,</b> since <b>we strengthen his words</b> of testimony because he attests to a matter of which he is certain, as he is the one that performed the action. <b>In the school of Rabbi Sheila they say: An agent cannot become a witness. Since the Master said</b> that the legal status of <b>a person’s agent is like</b> that of <b>himself,</b> the agent <b>is considered like</b> the one who appointed him <b>himself.</b> Just as one cannot testify with regard to a matter that concerns himself, the same applies to one’s agent.
<b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> to the statement of Rav: If one <b>said to three</b> people: <b>Go out and betroth the woman for me,</b> then <b>one</b> of them is the <b>agent</b> for the betrothal <b>and two</b> of them serve as <b>witnesses;</b> this is <b>the statement of Beit Shammai. And Beit Hillel say: They are all</b> potential <b>agents, and</b> as <b>an agent cannot become a witness</b> none of them can be witnesses. Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>disagree only with regard to</b> a case where one said this to <b>three</b> people. <b>But with regard to two</b> people, <b>all agree</b> that agents are <b>not</b> able to serve as witnesses.
The Gemara answers: It was <b>he,</b> Rav, <b>who said</b> his ruling <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that <i>tanna</i>,</b> i.e., the version of Beit Shammai as presented by Rabbi Natan. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Natan says: Beit Shammai say</b> that <b>the agent and one witness</b> are sufficient to carry out the agency and testify, <b>and Beit Hillel say: The agent and two witnesses</b> are needed. The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>And</b> would <b>Rav</b> rule <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Reverse</b> the opinions, so that it is Beit Hillel who said that the agent and one witness suffice. <b>And Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, taught</b> the dispute of the <i>amora’im</i> in the <b>opposite</b> manner. <b>Rav says: An agent cannot become a witness,</b> and <b>in the school of Rabbi Sheila they say: An agent can become a witness.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>an agent can become a witness.</b>
<b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> It follows that if one <b>said to two</b> people: <b>Go and betroth the woman for me, the very same</b> people who are <b>his agents</b> for the betrothal <b>are his witnesses. And a similar</b> <i>halakha</i> is true <b>with regard to divorce:</b> If a man sent a bill of divorce to his wife with two people, they serve both as agents of delivery and as witnesses to the divorce.

Daf 43b

<b>And a similar</b> <i>halakha</i> applies <b>with regard to</b> cases of <b>monetary law.</b> If one appoints agents to perform a transaction for him, e.g., paying a debt to his creditor, they can testify that he has paid.
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for Rav Naḥman to teach this <i>halakha</i> in each of these legal domains, <b>as had he taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only in</b> the case of <b>betrothal</b> one could say that the agents can serve as witnesses <b>because</b> they <b>are coming to render her forbidden</b> to everyone else, and therefore there is no reason to suspect them of lying, as their testimony renders her forbidden to them as well. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>divorce, we should be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the agent <b>cast his eyes upon her</b> and is testifying falsely so that he can marry her.
<b>And had</b> Rav Naḥman <b>taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> only in the case of <b>divorce,</b> it could have been said that the agents are not suspected of lying <b>because a woman is not fit for</b> marrying <b>two</b> people, and since they testify as a pair there is no concern that they both might have designs upon her. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>money,</b> one might <b>say</b> that <b>these</b> two can <b>divide</b> it between them, and perhaps they never paid the debt but kept the money themselves. Therefore, all the examples <b>are necessary.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What does</b> Rav Naḥman <b>hold? If he holds</b> that in the case of <b>one who lends</b> money to <b>another in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> the debtor <b>must repay him in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> then <b>these</b> agents <b>are affected by their testimony. As, if they say: We did not repay him</b> but returned the money to the one who appointed us, then the one who appointed them will <b>say to them: Pay me</b> back the money I gave you to repay the debt. The agents are considered as the debtors of the one who appointed them, as they took money from him. They would not be deemed credible to state that they returned the money to the one who appointed them, as they do not have witnesses that they did so. Consequently, they have a financial incentive to testify falsely that they fulfilled their agency and repaid the debt.
<b>Rather,</b> Rav Naḥman <b>actually holds</b> that in the case of <b>one who lends</b> money to <b>another in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> the debtor <b>does not need to repay him in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses. And since</b> the agents <b>are able to say: We returned</b> the money <b>to the debtor,</b> even without there being witnesses to substantiate their claim, <b>they can</b> also be deemed credible <b>to say: We repaid the creditor,</b> as they have no financial incentive to lie.
The Gemara comments: <b>And now,</b> since the time of Rav Naḥman, <b>when the Sages instituted an oath of inducement,</b> an oath instituted by the Sages in a case where a defendant completely denies a claim, these witnesses are affected by their testimony. If they were to claim that they returned the money to the one who appointed them, they would be required to take an oath of inducement to that effect. Consequently, they have an incentive to lie and claim that they fulfilled their agency and repaid the loan. Therefore, their testimony that they fulfilled their agency is not deemed credible. Instead, <b>these witnesses take an oath</b> in court <b>that they gave</b> the money <b>to him,</b> i.e., the lender, <b>and</b> the <b>lender</b> in turn <b>takes an oath that he did not take</b> the money owed to him, <b>and</b> then <b>the debtor pays the lender</b> his debt a second time, as the Sages ruled in similar cases.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>a man can betroth his daughter</b> to a man when she is a young woman. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Gittin</i> 64b): With regard to <b>a betrothed young woman, she and her father</b> are each eligible to <b>receive her bill of divorce. Rabbi Yehuda said: Two hands do not</b> have the right to <b>acquire</b> an item on behalf of one person <b>as one.</b> If the young woman is able to acquire an item on her own, her father cannot receive her bill of divorce. Conversely, if she is not able to acquire an item on her own, only her father can receive the bill of divorce. <b>Rather, her father</b> alone <b>receives her bill of divorce</b> on her behalf. The mishna states another principle: <b>And any</b> female <b>who is unable to safeguard her bill of divorce,</b> either due to her young age or mental incompetence, <b>is unable to be divorced,</b> since a bill of divorce is effective only for one who understands the severing of ties that a divorce engenders.
<b>Reish Lakish says: Just as</b> there is <b>a dispute with regard to divorce,</b> as to whether both a young woman and her father can accept her bill of divorce or only the father can do so, <b>so too</b> there is <b>a dispute with regard to betrothal. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The dispute is with regard to divorce, but</b> with regard to <b>betrothal everyone agrees</b> that <b>her father</b> has the right to accept it <b>but not her.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: What is the reason of Rabbi Yoḥanan, in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> that there is a distinction between divorce and betrothal? In the case of <b>divorce, when she brings herself</b> back <b>into her father’s authority</b> by means of the bill of divorce, it is considered as though the father has obtained the bill of divorce via his daughter, and therefore <b>either she or her father</b> can receive it. In the case of <b>betrothal, where she removes herself from her father’s authority,</b> she cannot do this by herself. Consequently, only <b>her father</b> can accept the betrothal, <b>but not her.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> the case of <b>levirate betrothal,</b> where the <i>yevama</i> <b>removes herself from her father’s authority, and</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:

Daf 44a

If <b>a minor girl</b> was widowed <b>after</b> her <b>betrothal,</b> a surviving brother of her betrothed <b>can perform levirate betrothal only with the consent of her father. And</b> in the case of <b>a young woman,</b> he can do so <b>either with her consent [<i>mida’at atzmah</i>] or with the consent of her father, unlike</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> standard <b>betrothal.</b> This indicates that a young woman can accept levirate betrothal on her own, despite the fact that it removes her from her father’s authority.
<b>Rather, if</b> it <b>was stated, it was stated like this: Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: What is</b> the <b>reason of Rabbi Yoḥanan, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis?</b> With regard to <b>betrothal, which</b> takes effect only <b>with</b> the <b>consent</b> of the one who accepts the betrothal, <b>her father</b> can accept it <b>but not her,</b> since betrothal requires his approval. With regard to a bill of <b>divorce,</b> which can be given <b>without her consent, either she or her father</b> can receive it.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t levirate betrothal</b> valid only <b>with her consent,</b> like other betrothals, <b>and</b> yet <b>it teaches</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>either she or her father</b> can accept it? The Gemara answers: <b>There</b> it is referring <b>to levirate betrothal that is</b> performed <b>against her will, and it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a <i>yavam</i> <b>performs levirate betrothal with his <i>yevama</i> without her consent, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The <i>yavam</i> <b>acquires</b> her. <b>And the Rabbis say: He does not acquire</b> her.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>He derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> of levirate betrothal <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>sexual intercourse that</b> a <i>yavam</i> engages in with <b>a <i>yevama</i>: Just as intercourse with</b> the <b><i>yevama</i></b> renders her acquired even if it is done <b>against her will, so too here,</b> in the case of levirate betrothal, the <i>yavam</i> can betroth her <b>against her will. And the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>we derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of levirate betrothal <b>from</b> standard <b>betrothal: Just as betrothal</b> can be performed only <b>with her consent, so too here,</b> levirate betrothal can be performed only <b>with her consent.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>With regard to what do they disagree? Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that <b>one should derive matters</b> involving <b>a <i>yevama</i> from</b> other matters involving <b>a <i>yevama</i>,</b> and the marriage between a <i>yevama</i> and a <i>yavam</i> can be formalized against her will. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>one should derive</b> matters involving <b>betrothal from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>betrothal,</b> as levirate betrothal is structured like standard betrothal in other respects.
The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to rule with regard to betrothal <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan explains,</b> that only the father can accept betrothal, <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it teaches</b> in the <b>latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> that with regard to levirate betrothal, in the case of <b>a young woman,</b> the <i>yavam</i> can perform it either with her consent or with the consent of her father, <b>unlike</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> standard <b>betrothal.</b> This indicates that she can be betrothed in standard betrothal only with her father’s agreement. The Gemara asks: <b>Then shall we say</b> that <b>this should be a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish,</b> who holds that according to the Rabbis a young woman can also accept her own betrothal? The Gemara answers: <b>Reish Lakish</b> could have <b>said to you:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says: Two hands do not acquire</b> an item <b>as one.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> why does the <i>baraita</i> state: <b>Unlike</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> standard <b>betrothal? It should</b> have stated: <b>Unlike</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to divorce,</b> as Rabbi Yehuda stated his opinion in the mishna with regard to divorce, not betrothal. The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so,</b> it should have referred to divorce, but <b>since it taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>levirate betrothal, which</b> is <b>similar to betrothal, it also taught: Unlike</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> standard <b>betrothal.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is levirate betrothal different from</b> divorce? Why can a young woman accept the former but not receive a bill of divorce, when both levirate betrothal and divorce can be performed without her consent? The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> of levirate betrothal is different. <b>Since she is bonded</b> to the <i>yavam</i> <b>and standing</b> in wait for him, acceptance of the betrothal money by the <i>yevama</i> suffices to effect the levirate betrothal. The Gemara comments: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> explanation, the statement of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan also should not pose a difficulty for you from the outset.</b> One cannot question his statement with regard to the Rabbis’ opinion in the case of betrothal. <b>Levirate betrothal is different, since</b> the <i>yevama</i> <b>is bonded</b> to the <i>yavam</i> <b>and standing</b> in wait for him.
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna that <b>a man can betroth his daughter</b> to a man <b>when she is a young woman, by himself or by</b> means of <b>his agent.</b> The Gemara analyzes this: <b>Yes,</b> he can betroth her <b>by himself or by</b> means of <b>his agent, but no,</b> she cannot become betrothed <b>by herself or by</b> means of <b>her agent.</b> This is <b>a conclusive refutation of Reish Lakish,</b> who holds that according to the opinion of the Rabbis a young woman can accept her own betrothal. The Gemara answers: <b>Reish Lakish</b> could have <b>said to you: This</b> mishna <b>too is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But can you establish this</b> mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda? But the last clause,</b> in the following mishna (46b), <b>teaches:</b> In the case of <b>one who says to a woman: Be betrothed to me with this date</b> and adds: <b>Be betrothed to me with that</b> date, she is betrothed only if one of them is worth one <i>peruta</i> on its own. <b>And we say: Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> that the two dates are valued separately only if he said: <b>Become betrothed</b> and: <b>Become betrothed,</b> in a separate statement when giving each date, but that if he said: Become betrothed, only once, the value of the two dates are added together?
<b>And Rabba said: It is Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> that one is not liable to bring multiple offerings for taking false oaths to multiple people in the same utterance. For example, if one says: I take an oath that I do not have your item, nor yours, nor yours, he brings a single offering. This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>unless one states</b> an expression of <b>an oath to each and every one</b> of the plaintiffs, by stating: I take an oath I do not have yours; I take an oath I do not have yours, in which case he brings multiple offerings. Consequently, the <i>tanna</i> of this mishna is Rabbi Shimon, not Rabbi Yehuda.
<b>And if you would say</b> that the <i>tanna</i> of the <b>entire</b> mishna concerning betrothal is <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and</b> that <b>with regard to the specification</b> of separate oaths <b>he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> this cannot be. <b>But does he</b> in fact <b>hold in accordance</b> with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon with regard to the specification of separate oaths?
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>This is the principle</b> with regard to one’s liability to bring offerings for a false oath: If he <b>included</b> all the statements in one oath <b>he is liable</b> for <b>only one</b> oath, but if he <b>specified</b> them, <b>he is liable for each and every one;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If one said: I take <b>an oath</b> that I do not have your deposit, <b>nor yours, nor yours, nor yours,</b> and he was found to have taken a false oath, <b>he is liable</b> to bring an offering <b>for each and every one. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> If he said: I do <b>not</b> have <b>yours, nor yours, nor yours, and nor yours,</b> I take <b>an oath,</b> then <b>he is liable for each and every one.</b> Since he stated the oath at the end, it refers back to each element of his statement. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: He is liable</b> to bring more than one offering <b>only if</b> he <b>states</b> an expression of <b>an oath for each and every one.</b> This indicates that Rabbi Yehuda disagrees with Rabbi Shimon with regard to the question of when oaths are considered distinct.
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara explains in the opposite manner: The <i>tanna</i> of the <b>entire</b> mishna concerning betrothal is <b>Rabbi Shimon, and with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>agency he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> that only the father of a young woman can appoint an agent to accept her betrothal or receive her bill of divorce.
The Gemara relates: One day <b>Rabbi Asi did not go to the study hall. He found Rabbi Zeira</b> and <b>said to him: What was said today in the study hall?</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: I too did not go,</b> but <b>Rabbi Avin is the one who went, and he said: The entire coterie</b> sided <b>with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that there is a difference between betrothal and divorce in the case of a young woman. <b>And Reish Lakish screamed</b> at them <b>like a crane:</b> Doesn’t the verse state: <b>“And she departs</b> out of his house <b>and</b> goes and <b>becomes</b> another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2), juxtaposing the <i>halakhot</i> of divorce and betrothal? <b>But no one paid any attention to him.</b> Rabbi Asi <b>said to him:</b> Is <b>Rabbi Avin reliable?</b> Can one be sure that he transmitted an accurate report? Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: Yes,</b> in this case he can be trusted, since the elapsed time <b>was</b> only <b>like</b> the interval between catching a fish <b>from the sea</b> and bringing it <b>to a frying pan [<i>tignei</i>].</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says:</b> When <b>I</b> quote this statement, I do <b>not</b> state it in the name of <b>Rabbi Avin, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, nor Rabbi Avin bar Kahana, but</b> in the name of <b>Rabbi Avin, without specification.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What difference is there?</b> Why does it matter which Rabbi Avin is cited as the source of this statement? The Gemara answers: It would matter if one were <b>to raise a contradiction between</b> one of <b>his</b> rulings and another one of <b>his</b> rulings. If there were to be a conflicting opinion attributed to a specific Rabbi Avin, e.g., Rabbi Avin, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, it would not be a true contradiction, as this statement might have been issued by a different Rabbi Avin.
<b>Rava asked Rav Naḥman:</b>

Daf 44b

According to the Rabbis, who hold that a young woman can accept her own bill of divorce, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the ability of <b>a young woman to appoint an agent to receive her bill of divorce from the hand of her husband?</b> The Gemara explains the two sides of this question: Since a young woman is under her father’s jurisdiction, is she, with regard to acquisitions, <b>considered like</b> an extension of <b>her father’s hand, or</b> is she <b>considered like her father’s courtyard?</b> The Gemara clarifies: She might be <b>considered like her father’s hand,</b> and <b>just as her father can appoint an agent, so too she can appoint an agent. Or perhaps</b> she is <b>considered like her father’s courtyard, and</b> therefore <b>she is not divorced until the bill of divorce</b> actually <b>reaches her possession,</b> as a courtyard cannot appoint an agent, but it can receive a bill of divorce, in the sense that a bill of divorce thrown in his courtyard is considered to be in his possession.
The Gemara asks: <b>And is Rava uncertain</b> about <b>this</b> matter? <b>But doesn’t Rava say:</b> If one <b>wrote a bill of divorce and placed it in the hand of</b> his wife’s <b>slave,</b> who is <b>sleeping, but</b> she <b>is guarding him,</b> then <b>it is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b> If the slave was <b>awake,</b> then <b>it is not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce. Why is it not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce</b> if he is <b>awake?</b> It is because the slave is <b>for her a courtyard that is not consciously secured by her,</b> i.e., when the slave is awake, he is not fully controlled by her. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that a young woman is <b>considered like her father’s courtyard,</b> then <b>even when the bill of divorce reaches her possession she should not be divorced, since she is</b> like <b>a courtyard that is not consciously secured by her father.</b>
<b>Rather, it is actually obvious to</b> Rava <b>that</b> a young woman <b>is considered like her father’s hand</b> and not like his courtyard, <b>and this is what he was asking: Is</b> she just <b>as strong as her father’s hand,</b> to the extent <b>that she can appoint an agent, or not?</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: She cannot appoint an agent.</b>
Rava <b>raised an objection to him</b> from a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 65a): In the case of <b>a minor girl who said</b> to an agent: <b>Receive my bill of divorce for me, it is not</b> a <b>valid bill of divorce until the bill of divorce reaches her possession,</b> since a minor is not considered halakhically competent and cannot appoint an agent. Rava inferred from this: <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a young woman, it is a bill of divorce,</b> which indicates that a young woman can appoint an agent. The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> With a situation <b>where she does not have a father,</b> and she can appoint an agent since she is of age and is under her own authority. But a betrothed young woman whose father is still alive is under his authority and cannot appoint an agent.
The Gemara asks: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that the latter</b> clause of that same mishna <b>teaches: If her father said</b> to an agent: <b>Go out and receive a bill of divorce for my daughter,</b> then <b>if the husband seeks to retract</b> his decision after he has given the bill of divorce to the agent <b>he cannot retract</b> it, since it is as though the bill of divorce reached her possession, <b>by inference,</b> one can say <b>that</b> in <b>the first</b> clause <b>we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where she has a father.</b> The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>is incomplete and this is what it is teaching:</b> In the case of <b>a minor girl who said: Receive my bill of divorce for me, it is not a bill of divorce until the bill of divorce reaches her possession. But</b> in the case of <b>a young woman, it is a bill of divorce</b> as soon as it reaches her agent’s possession. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said <b>when she does not have a father. But</b> if <b>she has a father, and her father said</b> to an agent: <b>Go out and receive my daughter’s bill of divorce on</b> her behalf, <b>and the husband seeks to retract</b> his decision, <b>he cannot retract</b> it.
§ <b>It was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disagreed in the case of <b>a minor who became betrothed without her father’s consent. Shmuel says:</b> If her husband seeks to divorce her <b>she requires a bill of divorce</b> to sever the marriage, <b>and she</b> also <b>requires refusal,</b> which annuls a betrothal that is valid by rabbinic law but not by Torah law. <b>Karna says:</b> There are puzzling <b>matters</b> included <b>within</b> this statement, since it is self-contradictory: <b>If</b> she needs <b>a bill of divorce,</b> and the betrothal is evidently treated as a proper betrothal, <b>why</b> does she require <b>refusal?</b> Conversely, <b>if</b> she requires <b>refusal,</b> indicating that her betrothal was of no consequence by Torah law, <b>why</b> does she require <b>a bill of divorce?</b>
The Sages <b>said to him: Now</b> that <b>Mar Ukva and his court are in</b> the town of <b>Kafrei,</b> let us pose the question to them. Furthermore, <b>they reversed</b> the names of the respective opinions of Shmuel and Karna and <b>sent</b> the question <b>before Rav.</b> He <b>said to</b> the messengers in the form of an oath: <b>By God! She requires a bill of divorce and she requires refusal. And</b> God <b>forbid that the seed of Abba bar Abba,</b> i.e., Shmuel, should <b>say such</b> a thing, that she does not require both.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that there is a need for both a bill of divorce and refusal? <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: She requires a bill of divorce</b> because <b>perhaps the father desired the betrothal,</b> which would mean it would take effect retroactively. <b>She</b> also <b>requires refusal</b> because <b>perhaps the father did not desire the betrothal,</b> and it did not take effect. If she receives only a bill of divorce, <b>and</b> her former husband proceeds to betroth her sister, people <b>will say</b> that the <b>betrothal does not take effect with her sister.</b> The <i>halakha</i> is that betrothal can take effect with the sister of one’s wife or former wife only after the first wife has died. She is therefore required to perform refusal, to indicate that the validity of her betrothal was uncertain. If he later betroths her sister, he would be required to divorce her due to the uncertainty if this second betrothal took effect.
<b>Rav Naḥman said: And this</b> concern that the father of a minor might later state that he desired her betrothal is relevant only <b>when they arranged</b> the match before she betrothed herself, as in that case it is likely that the father desired the betrothal.
The Gemara quotes another opinion. <b>Ulla said:</b> If a minor accepted betrothal without her father’s consent, her betrothal does not take effect, and <b>she does not even require refusal.</b> The Gemara asks: Does Ulla’s statement apply <b>even though they arranged</b> the match? The Gemara answers: <b>He who teaches this does not teach that.</b> The one who cited Ulla’s statement does not hold that Shmuel’s ruling applies only in the case of an arranged match, rather it applies in all cases. According to this opinion, Ulla stated his <i>halakha</i> only in a case where the match was not arranged. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Ulla says:</b> If <b>a minor became betrothed without her father’s consent, she does not even require refusal,</b> including a case where the match was arranged.
<b>Rav Kahana raises an objection:</b> The mishna in <i>Yevamot</i> (2a) teaches that if a potential <i>yevama</i> is in one of the fifteen categories of women forbidden to the <i>yavam</i> as a relative, not only is she forbidden to him, but he also may not perform levirate marriage with any of her rival wives. The Sages then clarified this <i>halakha</i>: <b>And if,</b> before the husband had died, <b>any of</b> those forbidden women <b>had died, or had performed refusal; or had been divorced; or had been found</b> to be <b>a sexually underdeveloped woman [<i>ailonit</i>],</b> who is incapable of bearing children, then <b>her rival wives are permitted</b> to the <i>yavam</i>.
Rav Kahana focuses on the case of one who performed refusal: With regard to this refusal that she performed, what type of betrothal did it follow? <b>When she was betrothed by whom? If we say</b> that <b>her father betrothed her</b> to the brother who died, is <b>refusal</b> alone <b>enough for her</b> to dissolve the marriage? Doesn’t she <b>require a proper bill of divorce? Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where she betrothed herself</b> when she was a minor, <b>and</b> the mishna nevertheless <b>teaches that she requires refusal.</b> This presents a difficulty for Ulla, who holds that she does not need even refusal.
The Gemara comments: Rav Kahana <b>raised the objection and he resolved it:</b> The mishna refers to a case <b>where she became</b> like <b>an orphan in her father’s lifetime,</b> i.e., her father betrothed her to a man, and she was subsequently widowed or divorced while still a minor. In that case, the same <i>halakha</i> as that of an orphan applies to her, in that her father does not have the right to betroth her again, although he is still alive. If she then would betroth herself, her betrothal is not effective by Torah law, because she is still a minor. It does take effect by rabbinic law, and she can annul that marriage by performing refusal. This would not be a question for Ulla, as he stated his ruling in a case where it was the first betrothal of the minor.
<b>Rav Hamnuna raises an objection:</b> It is taught in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a Hebrew maidservant: A father <b>cannot sell</b> his minor daughter as a Hebrew maidservant <b>to</b> her <b>relatives</b> because the Torah requires that the one who purchases a maidservant be able to marry her. The Sages <b>said in the name of Rabbi Elazar:</b> He can <b>sell her</b> even <b>to</b> her <b>relatives,</b> as sometimes a Hebrew maidservant serves only in that capacity, without marrying the master.

Daf 45a

<b>And they agree that he can sell her to a High Priest</b> even if she is <b>a widow,</b> or <b>to a common priest</b> even if she is <b>a divorcée or</b> is <b>a <i>yevama</i> who performed <i>ḥalitza</i> [<i>ḥalutza</i>].</b> Although such marriages are prohibited, they do take effect. The Gemara analyzes this: <b>What are the circumstances of this widow</b> who can be sold as a maidservant by her father? <b>If we say</b> that <b>her father betrothed her</b> and her husband subsequently died while she was still a minor, <b>is he able to sell her</b> after her betrothal? <b>A person cannot sell his daughter into servitude after</b> he has <b>betrothed</b> her. <b>Rather, isn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> referring to a case <b>when she betrothed herself</b> as a minor, <b>and</b> yet it <b>calls her a widow,</b> indicating that such a betrothal is effective, contrary to the opinion of Ulla.
<b>Rav Amram said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Here</b> it deals with a minor girl widowed <b>from a betrothal of designation,</b> i.e., her father sold her as a Hebrew maidservant, and the master designated her as his wife but died before he married her. <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, who says: The original money</b> of the sale of the maidservant <b>was not given for</b> the purpose of <b>betrothal.</b> Rather, her betrothal goes into effect when her master relinquishes his rights to have her serve as a Hebrew maidservant. Since this betrothal was not accepted by the father, he is later permitted to sell her as a maidservant again.
§ <b>It was stated:</b> If a man who betrothed a minor without her father’s consent <b>died, and she happened before his brothers for levirate marriage, Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> She <b>performs refusal for his levirate betrothal,</b> i.e., if the <i>yavam</i> performed levirate betrothal with her, divorce is effected only by means of refusal in addition to a bill of divorce, <b>but she</b> does not <b>perform refusal for his</b> levirate <b>bond</b> to her. If he did not perform levirate betrothal, she does not require refusal as well as <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>How so?</b> If <b>he performed levirate betrothal with her, she requires a bill of divorce, and she requires <i>ḥalitza</i>, and she requires refusal.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>She requires a bill of divorce,</b> as <b>perhaps the father desired the betrothal of</b> only <b>the second</b> man. Levirate betrothal is performed in the same manner as standard betrothal, i.e., by giving money. If the father did not desire the first betrothal she is not a <i>yevama</i>, and the second betrothal goes into effect, requiring a bill of divorce to end the betrothal. She <b>requires <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> as <b>perhaps the father desired the betrothal of the first</b> man, in which case she is a regular <i>yevama</i>, who requires <i>ḥalitza</i> to be released from the <i>yavam</i>. <b>She requires refusal,</b> as <b>perhaps the father did not desire either the betrothal of the first</b> man <b>or the betrothal of the second</b> man. If she receives a bill of divorce and performs <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>and</b> the second man proceeds to betroth her sister, people <b>will say</b> that the <b>betrothal does not take effect with her sister,</b> as they will think that the first betrothal was fully valid.
If <b>he did not perform levirate betrothal with her, she requires only <i>ḥalitza</i>.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>If you say</b> that <b>she should require refusal as well, lest</b> people <b>say</b> that <b>betrothal does not take effect with her sister,</b> that is unnecessary. <b>Everyone knows</b> that <b>a sister of</b> one’s <b><i>ḥalutza</i></b> is forbidden <b>by rabbinic law</b> only; therefore, they also know that betrothal with the sister would be effective, and they would not permit the sister to marry others without receiving a bill of divorce. This is <b>as Reish Lakish said</b> with regard to the wording of a mishna (<i>Yevamot</i> 41a): <b>Here Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi incidentally <b>taught</b> that <b>a sister of</b> one’s <b>divorcée</b> is forbidden to him <b>by Torah law,</b> whereas <b>a sister of</b> one’s <b><i>ḥalutza</i></b> is forbidden to him <b>by rabbinic law.</b>
§ The Gemara relates: There were <b>these two</b> people <b>that were</b> sitting and <b>drinking wine under poplar trees [<i>tzifei</i>] in Babylonia. One of them took a cup of wine</b> and <b>gave it to his friend. He said: Betroth for me your daughter to my son</b> by receiving this cup of wine. <b>Ravina says: Even according to the one who says</b> that in the case of a minor girl who became betrothed without her father’s consent, <b>we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps the father desired</b> the betrothal,

Daf 45b

and <b>we do not say</b> that <b>perhaps the son desired</b> the betrothal. <b>The Sages said to Ravina: But perhaps</b> the son <b>appointed</b> his father as <b>an agent</b> to betroth her, and the betrothal should take effect. He replied: <b>A person is not</b> so <b>brazen</b> as <b>to appoint his father</b> as his <b>agent</b> and thereby treat him as an assistant of sorts. They further inquired: <b>But perhaps</b> the son <b>made his desire</b> known <b>to</b> his father by speaking of his desire to marry the woman, and the father acted of his own accord upon his son’s wishes and betrothed her to him. <b>Rabba bar Shimi said to</b> Ravina: This is not a concern, <b>since the Master,</b> i.e., Ravina, <b>explicitly said that he does not agree with this</b> opinion <b>of Rav and Shmuel</b> that when a minor girl accepts betrothal there is a concern that perhaps the father desired it. So too, there is no concern that a father can act for the son without his awareness.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who betrothed</b> a minor girl without her father’s consent <b>with a bundle of vegetables in the marketplace. Ravina says: Even according to the one who says</b> that when a minor becomes betrothed without her father’s consent <b>we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps the father desired</b> the betrothal, <b>this matter applies</b> only if the man betrothed her <b>in a dignified manner. But</b> as the betrothal in this case was done <b>in a degrading manner,</b> there is <b>no</b> concern.
<b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: What</b> was the <b>degradation</b> in this manner of betrothal? <b>Was</b> the <b>degradation</b> from the fact <b>that</b> he used <b>vegetables,</b> or <b>was</b> the <b>degradation</b> due to the betrothal having been performed <b>in the marketplace?</b> The <b>practical difference</b> concerns cases <b>where one betrothed</b> a minor girl <b>with money in the marketplace, or</b> where one betrothed a minor girl <b>with a bundle of vegetables in a house. What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Ravina <b>said to him:</b> Both <b>this and that,</b> i.e., each of them <b>is</b> considered <b>a degrading manner.</b>
The Gemara further relates: A couple wanted to marry off their minor daughter. <b>That</b> one, the father, <b>said:</b> I want to marry her off <b>to my relative, while she,</b> the mother, <b>said</b> she wanted to marry the daughter off <b>to her relative.</b> His wife pressured him and <b>forced him until he said to</b> her: <b>Let</b> the girl <b>be</b> married <b>to her,</b> i.e., the mother’s, <b>relative. While they were eating and drinking</b> the festive meal before the betrothal, <b>his relative came to the roof and betrothed her</b> to himself.
The Gemara assumes that the father did not desire this betrothal. Why? <b>Abaye said: It is written: “The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies”</b> (Zephaniah 3:13). The father had agreed that she would marry his wife’s relative, and he would stand by his word. Since the betrothal of his minor daughter is dependent on his desire, there is no concern that the father desired his relative’s betrothal. <b>Rava said</b> a different reason: There is <b>a presumption that a person does not take the trouble of</b> preparing <b>a meal and</b> then <b>cause it to be lost.</b> Since he prepared a festive meal in honor of his daughter’s betrothal to his wife’s relative, he would not desire a betrothal that would render his efforts for naught.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between</b> these two explanations? The Gemara answers: <b>The</b> difference <b>between them</b> concerns a case <b>where he did not take the trouble</b> of preparing a meal. According to Rava, since he had not gone to any effort, there should be concern that the betrothal is valid. Abaye would hold that since he would not go back on his word, they are not betrothed.
§ If a minor <b>became betrothed with her father’s consent, and her father left for overseas, and she went ahead and got married</b> of her own accord in her father’s absence, <b>Rav says:</b> If she is an Israelite who married a priest, <b>she may partake of <i>teruma</i> until her father comes and protests,</b> explicitly stating that he does not agree to the marriage. <b>Rav Asi said: She may not partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>. <b>Perhaps her father will come and protest, and it will be found retroactively that a non-priest has partaken of <i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>There was an incident</b> of this kind, <b>and Rav was concerned</b> for this opinion <b>of Rav Asi</b> and did not allow a girl in this situation to partake of <i>teruma</i>.
<b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says: And Rav concedes that if</b> the minor girl <b>dies,</b> the husband <b>does not inherit</b> from <b>her,</b> because of the principle: <b>Establish money in the possession of its owner.</b> Since the validity of her marriage is a matter of uncertainty, as the father might protest it, the money remains with her previous inheritors.
The Gemara cites another dispute between the Sages: If a minor <b>became betrothed with</b> her father’s <b>consent, and she married without</b> his <b>consent, and her father is here,</b> i.e., present, <b>Rav Huna said: She may not partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>. <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said: She may partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>.
The Gemara explains the two opinions: <b>Rav Huna said she may not partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>, <b>and even according to Rav, who said</b> that if her father is overseas <b>she may partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>, this is so only <b>there,</b> in the case <b>where the father is not present. But here, where the father is present,</b> he does not consent to the marriage; the reason <b>that he was silent</b> in <b>this</b> situation and refrained from protesting is that he was <b>so angry</b> that he did not wish even to speak to her. Conversely, <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said: She may partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>, <b>and even according to Rav Asi, who said</b> that <b>she may not partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>, it is <b>there</b> that there is a concern <b>that perhaps her father will come and protest. But here, from</b> the fact <b>that he was silent</b> the assumption is that <b>he is comfortable</b> with the marriage.
The Gemara cites another case: If a minor <b>became betrothed without the consent of her father, and married without</b> his <b>consent, and her father is here, Rav Huna said: She may partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>. <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said: She may not partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>. <b>Ulla said: This</b> opinion <b>of Rav Huna,</b> that in this case she may partake of <i>teruma</i>, is irritating <b>“as vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes”</b> (Proverbs 10:26), as it contradicts his earlier ruling. <b>Now</b> consider: <b>And what</b> about <b>there,</b> i.e., in a case where her betrothal was with her father’s consent, <b>when</b> there is at least <b>betrothal by Torah law, you said she may not partake</b> of <i>teruma</i> in case he did not consent to the marriage. Is it <b>not all the more so</b> the case that <b>here,</b> i.e., where even the betrothal was performed without her father’s consent, she should not be permitted to partake of <i>teruma</i>?

Daf 46a

Rather, <b>the statement of</b> the <b>student seems</b> reasonable. Although Rav Yirmeya bar Abba was like a student compared with Rav Huna, his opinion makes more sense. <b>Rava said: What is the reason of Rav Huna? Since an action was done with her</b> that renders her like <b>an orphan in the lifetime of her father,</b> she is considered married and may partake of <i>teruma</i>. The fact that her father ignored both her betrothal and her marriage indicates that he has waived his rights to control whom she marries. She is therefore considered like an orphan, whose marriage is valid with her own consent.
§ <b>It was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disputed the following issue: In the case of <b>a minor girl who became betrothed without her father’s consent, Rav says: Either she or her father is able to prevent</b> the betrothal from taking effect. <b>And Rav Asi says: Her father</b> can prevent it <b>but not she,</b> since she initially agreed. <b>Rav Huna raised an objection to Rav Asi, and some say</b> it was <b>Ḥiyya bar Rav</b> who raised an objection <b>to Rav Asi:</b> The <i>baraita</i> states in the case of a seduced woman: <b>“If her father refuses</b> to give her to him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins” (Exodus 22:16). The Sages expounded: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>her father</b> can refuse to give her to the seducer in marriage; <b>from where</b> do I derive that <b>she herself</b> can also refuse? <b>The verse states: “If he refuses [<i>ma’en yema’en</i>].”</b> The repetition of the verb indicates that the right of refusal exists <b>in any case.</b> Despite the fact that she was seduced, she can change her mind and say that she does not want to marry him.
<b>Rav said to those</b> who tried to offer support for his opinion: <b>Do not go after the opposite,</b> i.e., do not cite a proof from a source that could be understood in the opposite manner. Rav Asi <b>can answer your</b> argument by claiming that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where he</b> initially <b>seduced her not for the sake of marriage.</b> Their initial act of intercourse was not performed in order to effect betrothal, so they are not betrothed. The Gemara questions this: In the case of <b>a seduction</b> that is <b>not for the sake of marriage,</b> is <b>a verse required</b> to teach that she can refuse to marry him? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says:</b> It serves <b>to say that</b> if she refuses to marry him despite her father’s consent to the match, the seducer nevertheless <b>pays the fine like</b> a standard case of <b>a seduced woman.</b> The obligation to pay the fine is not only for a case where her father refuses to let her marry the seducer.
<b>Rav Yosef said to him: If so,</b> if the <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case where intercourse was not performed to effect betrothal, <b>this is what we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a seduced woman: <b>“He shall pay a dowry for her to be his wife”</b> (Exodus 22:15). This teaches <b>that she requires betrothal from him. And if</b> the verse is speaking of one who <b>seduced her for the sake of marriage, why do I</b> need <b>betrothal?</b> The act of intercourse can serve as the betrothal. Rather, the <i>baraita</i> must be referring to a case where he seduced her not for the sake of marriage. <b>Abaye said to him:</b> Even if he seduced her for the sake of marriage, <b>she requires</b> an additional <b>betrothal with her father’s consent,</b> since she is a minor and became betrothed without it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who says to a woman: Be betrothed to me with this date,</b> and adds: <b>Be betrothed to me with that</b> one, then <b>if one of</b> the dates <b>is worth one <i>peruta</i> she is betrothed, but if not, she is not betrothed,</b> since he mentioned betrothal in connection with each date. But if he said: Be betrothed to me <b>with this</b> one, <b>and with this</b> one, <b>and with this</b> one, then even <b>if all of them</b> together <b>are worth one <i>peruta</i> she is betrothed, but if not, she is not betrothed.</b> If he gave her dates with the intention of betrothing her with them, and <b>she was eating</b> them <b>one by one</b> as she received them, <b>she is not betrothed unless one of them is worth one <i>peruta</i>.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> that it is only if he says: <b>Be betrothed to me, be betrothed to me,</b> in connection with each date that each act of betrothal is considered distinct? <b>Rabba says: It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who said</b> in the context of the laws of deposit oaths: He is never liable to bring more than one offering <b>unless he will state</b> an expression of <b>an oath to each and every one.</b>
The mishna teaches: If one said: <b>With this</b> one, <b>and with this</b> one, <b>and with this</b> one, she is betrothed even <b>if all of them</b> together <b>are worth one <i>peruta</i>.</b> The mishna subsequently states that if she was eating the dates one by one, she is betrothed only if one of them is worth one <i>peruta</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>To which</b> clause of the mishna is the case of the woman eating the dates one by one referring? <b>If we say</b> it <b>is referring to the first clause</b> of the mishna, when he betrothed her separately with each date, <b>why</b> would the mishna <b>specifically</b> state that <b>she ate</b> them? <b>Even</b> if <b>she placed</b> them down without eating them the same <i>halakha</i> would <b>also</b> apply, <b>as he said: Be betrothed to me with this</b> date, so each date must be worth one <i>peruta</i>. <b>Rather,</b> it must be referring <b>to the latter clause,</b> when he said that he is betrothing her with all the dates. In such a situation, if she ate them one by one, she is betrothed only if one of them is worth one <i>peruta</i>.
The Gemara proceeds to ask: <b>And</b> is she betrothed <b>even</b> if <b>the first</b> date is worth one <i>peruta</i>? <b>But</b> until he has given her all the dates for the betrothal, each individual date <b>is</b> considered to be <b>a loan,</b> because if he were to retract his betrothal before giving her all of the dates she would have to return them to him, and one cannot betroth a woman by giving her a loan. By the time he finishes giving her the dates, the first one has already been eaten, so it is not able to effect the betrothal. With regard to this difficulty <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: There is a table, and there is meat, and there is a knife, and we have nothing to eat.</b> In other words, everything in the mishna is explicit yet we cannot explain it.
<b>Rav and Shmuel both said: Actually,</b> the case of the woman eating the dates one by one <b>is referring to the first clause</b> of the mishna, where one betrothed the woman with each date separately, <b>and it is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary.</b> The mishna stated, for stylistic reasons, a <i>halakha</i> that it did not need to state, and should be understood as follows: <b>It is not necessary</b> to state the <i>halakha</i> in the case of a woman who <b>placed</b> the dates down, <b>that if</b> one of them <b>is worth one <i>peruta</i>, yes,</b> she is betrothed, and <b>if not,</b> she is <b>not</b> betrothed. <b>But</b> in a case where she was <b>eating</b> them, one might think that <b>since her benefit is immediate, say that she has decided to transfer herself</b> to him by means of that date, although it is worth less than one <i>peruta</i>. The mishna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that she is nevertheless not betrothed.
<b>Rabbi Ami said</b> a different explanation: <b>Actually,</b> the case of the woman eating the dates one by one <b>is referring to the latter clause</b> of the mishna, where he betrothed her by giving her all of the dates. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of: <b>Unless one of them is worth one <i>peruta</i>?</b> It means: <b>Unless the last</b> of them <b>is worth one <i>peruta</i>.</b> But if one of the other dates is worth one <i>peruta</i> she is not betrothed, since they are considered a loan until all the dates have been given.
<b>Rava says: Conclude three</b> conclusions <b>from</b> this statement <b>of Rabbi Ami: Conclude from it</b> that in the case of <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with a loan, she is not betrothed,</b> since she is not betrothed with a date that she has already eaten. <b>And conclude from it</b> that in the case of <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>by</b> forgiving <b>a loan and</b> giving her <b>one <i>peruta</i>, her mind</b> is focused <b>on the <i>peruta</i></b> although the debt is far larger, and she will be betrothed. In the latter case, although the value of the dates she ate was more than the value of the last date, which was merely worth one <i>peruta</i>, she is nevertheless betrothed.

Daf 46b

<b>And conclude from it</b> that <b>generally, money</b> that was given for a betrothal that did not take effect is <b>returned.</b> It is not viewed as a gift, but as a loan that must be repaid. This is evident from the fact that all the dates except the last one are considered a loan that must be repaid.
§ <b>It was stated:</b> In the case of <b>one who betroths his sister</b> by giving her money, <b>Rav says: The money</b> of the betrothal must be <b>returned</b> by his sister, as this betrothal does not take effect. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> This <b>money</b> is considered to be <b>a gift</b> that she may keep. The Gemara clarifies their respective opinions. <b>Rav says: The money</b> must be <b>returned,</b> since <b>a person knows that betrothal does not take effect with his sister, and he decided to give</b> the money to her <b>for the sake of a deposit.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>And let him</b> explicitly <b>say to her</b> that he is giving her the money <b>for the sake of a deposit.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He thought she would not accept</b> it from him.
<b>And Shmuel maintains:</b> The <b>money</b> is considered to be <b>a gift,</b> because <b>a person knows that betrothal does not take effect with his sister, and he decided to give</b> the money to her <b>for the sake of a gift.</b> The Gemara again raises a difficulty: <b>And let him</b> explicitly <b>say to her</b> that he is giving it to her <b>for the sake of a gift.</b> The Gemara answers: He <b>thought it would be embarrassing to her</b> and she would refuse to accept the money. He therefore attempted to give it her by an alternative method.
<b>Ravina raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Ḥalla</i> 2:5): In the case of <b>one who separates his <i>ḥalla</i>,</b> the portion of dough that must be given to a priest, from <b>flour,</b> before it has been made into dough, the portion he has separated <b>is not <i>ḥalla</i>.</b> Since the Torah states: “Of the first of your dough you shall set apart” (Numbers 15:20), <i>ḥalla</i> can be separated only from dough. <b>And</b> if the priest fails to return the flour it is considered <b>stolen property in the priest’s possession.</b> Ravina asks: <b>And why</b> is it <b>stolen property in the priest’s possession?</b> In this case too, <b>let us say</b> as Shmuel does: <b>A person knows that one cannot separate <i>ḥalla</i></b> from <b>flour, and he gave</b> the flour <b>for the sake of a gift.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>There it is different.</b> The priest must return the flour <b>because</b> otherwise a <b>ruinous</b> situation may <b>emerge from it.</b> How so? <b>Sometimes the priest has,</b> on his own, <b>less than five-fourths</b> of a <i>kav</i> of <b>flour,</b> i.e., he has less than the amount necessitating the separation of <i>ḥalla</i>, <b>and</b> he also has <b>this</b> flour, which gives him a total of more than five-fourths of a <i>kav</i>, the amount necessitating the separation of <i>ḥalla</i>. <b>He will knead</b> all <b>this</b> flour <b>together and</b> will <b>think his dough has been made ready</b> with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>, since he did not have enough of his own flour to require the separation of <i>ḥalla</i> and he had added flour that had been separated as <i>ḥalla</i> to it. <b>And he will</b> then <b>come to eat it in its untithed</b> state, as the flour he received was not in fact <i>ḥalla</i>. Therefore, the Sages required him to return the flour.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t you say</b> that <b>a person knows that one may not separate <i>ḥalla</i></b> from <b>flour?</b> How can the priest make such an error? The Gemara answers: <b>He knows</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>but he does not know</b> the reason for the <i>halakha</i>. <b>He knows that one cannot separate <i>ḥalla</i></b> from <b>flour, but he does not know</b> the reason, <b>as he thinks: What</b> is <b>the reason</b> one may not separate <i>ḥalla</i> from flour? <b>Due to the labor of the priest,</b> i.e., to prevent the priest from having to knead it himself. And as far as <b>the labor of the priest</b> goes, he thinks: <b>I have relinquished</b> the right to have the non-priest knead it for me.
The Gemara asks a question based on a comparison to a similar case: <b>But</b> why must the priest go to the effort of returning the flour to its owner? <b>Let</b> the separated flour <b>be</b> considered <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> i.e., <i>ḥalla</i>, by rabbinic law, <b>and it should not be eaten</b> by the priest <b>until he removes <i>ḥalla</i> for it from somewhere else,</b> in order to make it ready to be eaten. <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 5:10): If one separated <i>teruma</i> <b>from</b> produce grown in <b>a perforated</b> pot, which is obligated in <i>terumot</i> and tithes by Torah law, <b>for</b> produce that had grown in <b>a non-perforated</b> pot, which is not obligated in <i>terumot</i> and tithes according to Torah law; although the separating of <i>teruma</i> did not take effect, and the putative <i>teruma</i> is still untithed produce, it is considered to be <b><i>teruma</i></b> and remains in the possession of the priest, <b>and it may not be eaten until he removes <i>teruma</i> and tithes for it from somewhere else.</b> The same <i>halakha</i> should apply in the case of the <i>ḥalla</i>.
The Gemara answers: With regard to things that are <b>in two</b> separate <b>containers,</b> the priest <b>will listen.</b> Since the priest is well aware of the difference between a perforated and a non-perforated pot, he will accept the ruling of the Sages to separate <i>teruma</i> an additional time. With regard to something that is <b>in one container, he will not listen.</b> He does not see any difference between receiving flour or dough, and he will not accept the ruling of the Sages to separate <i>ḥalla</i> an additional time. Consequently, they required him to return the flour.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> that the <i>tanna</i> has a different concern: <b>Actually, a priest will listen</b> even with regard to something in a single container, <b>and</b> the concern is that the prior <b>owner</b> of the flour <b>will think</b> that <b>his dough has been made ready</b> to eat <b>and</b> he <b>will come to eat</b> it <b>in</b> its <b>untithed</b> state.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t you say</b> that <b>a person knows that one may not separate <i>ḥalla</i></b> from <b>flour?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He knows</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>but he does not know</b> the reason for the <i>halakha</i>. <b>He knows that one cannot separate <i>ḥalla</i></b> from <b>flour, but he does not know</b> the reason, <b>as he thinks: What</b> is <b>the reason</b> one may not separate <i>ḥalla</i> from flour? It is <b>due to the labor of the priest.</b> And as far as <b>the labor of the priest</b> goes, he thinks: The priest <b>has accepted</b> that task upon <b>himself.</b>
The Gemara makes a suggestion based on a comparison to a similar case: <b>But let it be <i>teruma</i>,</b> i.e., <i>ḥalla</i>, <b>and he should separate <i>teruma</i> again. Didn’t we learn</b> a similar idea in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 5:10): If one separated <i>teruma</i> <b>from</b> produce grown in <b>a non-perforated</b> pot <b>for</b> the produce of <b>a perforated</b> pot, it is <b><i>teruma</i></b> by rabbinic law, <b>but he must separate <i>teruma</i> again</b> to render the produce grown in the perforated pot ready to eat. The Gemara answers: <b>We have</b> already <b>established</b> that with regard to things that are <b>in two</b> separate <b>containers,</b> one <b>will listen,</b> but with regard to something that is <b>in one container, one will not listen.</b>
The Gemara questions this assumption: <b>And will</b> one <b>not listen</b> to a ruling to separate <i>teruma</i> a second time from a single container? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 3:1): In the case of <b>one who separated a cucumber</b> as <b><i>teruma</i></b> to give to a priest, <b>and</b> that cucumber <b>was found</b> to be so <b>bitter</b> that it was inedible, or if he separated <b>a melon and it was found</b> to be <b>spoiled,</b> his separation is still <b><i>teruma</i>, but he must separate <i>teruma</i> again?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There it is different, as it is full-fledged <i>teruma</i> by Torah law,</b> and even if he does not listen and separate <i>teruma</i> again, no Torah law will be violated.
What is the source from which it is extrapolated that it is full-fledged <i>teruma</i> by Torah law? It is <b>from</b> a statement <b>of Rabbi Ilai, for Rabbi Ilai says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one who separates <i>teruma</i> from poor-quality</b> produce <b>for superior-quality</b> produce, i.e., in order to fulfill the obligation of separating <i>teruma</i> from the high-quality produce, <b>that his <i>teruma</i> is <i>teruma</i>? As it is stated</b> with regard to <i>teruma</i>: <b>“And you shall bear no sin by reason of it, seeing that you have set apart from it the best thereof”</b> (Numbers 18:32). The verse is saying to give the best part as <i>teruma</i>, and one who gives a bad portion has committed a transgression. Nevertheless, the verse indicates that the separated produce is <i>teruma</i>; <b>if it were not sacred</b> as <i>teruma</i> <b>why</b> would one <b>bear a sin?</b> If one’s action were to no effect, he has not sinned. <b>From here</b> it is derived <b>that</b> if <b>one separates <i>teruma</i> from poor-quality</b> produce <b>for superior-quality</b> produce, <b>his <i>teruma</i> is <i>teruma</i>.</b>
<b>Rava said:</b>

Daf 47a

The mishna <b>taught</b> that if she ate the dates one by one their value is not added together <b>only if he said to her</b> that she is betrothed: <b>With this</b> one, <b>and with this</b> one, <b>and with this</b> one, which indicates that she is not betrothed until she has received them all. <b>But</b> if <b>he said to her</b> that he is betrothing her: <b>With these,</b> i.e., with all of them together, <b>even</b> if she <b>is eating</b> them one by one she is <b>also betrothed</b> if their combined value is one <i>peruta</i>. The reason is that <b>when she eats, she eats of her own</b> food. Once she has accepted the dates as money for betrothal, they become her own property and she is betrothed.
The Gemara comments: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava:</b> If one said to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with</b> the fruit of <b>an oak tree,</b> i.e., an acorn, <b>with a pomegranate, and with a nut, or if he said to her: Be betrothed to me with these, if combined they are worth one <i>peruta</i>, she is betrothed. But if not, she is not betrothed.</b> If he said to her: Be betrothed to me <b>with this</b> one, <b>and with this</b> one, <b>and with this</b> one, <b>if combined they are worth one <i>peruta</i>, she is betrothed. But if not, she is not betrothed.</b> If he said to her: Be betrothed to me <b>with this</b> one, and <b>she took it and ate it; with this</b> one, and <b>she took it and ate it; and also with this</b> one <b>and also with this</b> one, <b>she is not betrothed unless one of them is worth one <i>peruta</i>.</b> This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara proceeds to prove Rava’s ruling from the <i>baraita</i>. <b>What are the circumstances</b> in <b>this</b> first case, where he said: <b>With</b> the fruit of <b>an oak tree, with a pomegranate, with a nut? If we say that he said to her: Either with</b> the fruit of <b>an oak tree, or with a pomegranate, or with a nut,</b> why is the <i>halakha</i> that <b>if combined they are worth one <i>peruta</i> she is betrothed? But didn’t he say: Or,</b> which indicates that she is betrothed with only one of them, and that one item should need to be worth one <i>peruta</i>? <b>But rather,</b> if we say that he said to her: <b>With</b> the fruit of <b>an oak tree, and with a pomegranate, and with a nut</b> together, <b>that is</b> the same as saying: <b>With this</b> one, <b>and with this</b> one, <b>and with this</b> one. That <i>halakha</i> is stated in the subsequent clause of the <i>baraita</i>, and would be redundant. <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where he said to her:</b> Be betrothed to me <b>with these? But from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause teaches: Or if he said to her: Be betrothed to me with these, it may be inferred that</b> in <b>the first clause we are not dealing with</b> a situation where he said: <b>These.</b>
The Gemara continues with the explication of the <i>baraita</i>: Rather, it is to be understood as an initial, general statement, which the <i>tanna</i> <b>is</b> then <b>explaining,</b> as follows: If one says to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with</b> the fruit of <b>an oak tree, with a pomegranate, with a nut;</b> the <i>baraita</i> pauses and explains the circumstances of the case: <b>How so? For example, when he</b> gave her these three items and <b>said to her: Be betrothed to me with these.</b>
The Gemara continues with its proof: <b>And the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> a second possibility: If he said to her that she is betrothed: <b>With this</b> one, and she <b>took it and ate it,</b> then <b>if one of them is worth one <i>peruta</i>, she is betrothed. And if not, she is not betrothed.</b>
<b>While</b> in contrast to this, <b>in the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> the <i>tanna</i> <b>does not distinguish between</b> a woman who <b>is eating</b> the items <b>and one who is placing</b> them in her possession. In either case, she is betrothed. You can <b>conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that <b>any</b> case <b>where he said to her: With these,</b> if they were worth one <i>peruta</i> combined, then <b>when she is eating</b> them <b>she is eating of her own</b> food. It is not considered a loan. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that Rava’s statement is correct.
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one,</b> i.e., Rabbi Ami, <b>who says</b> that the case of the woman eating the dates one by one <b>is referring to the latter clause</b> of the mishna, where he said: Be betrothed to me with this and with that, <b>and</b> who explained: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: She is not betrothed <b>unless one of them is worth one <i>peruta</i>? Unless the last one is worth one <i>peruta</i>. So too,</b> the <i>baraita</i> can be explained: <b>Unless the last one is worth one <i>peruta</i>.</b>
<b>But according to Rav and Shmuel, who both say</b> that the case of the woman eating the dates one by one <b>is referring to the first clause</b> of the mishna, how would they explain the statement of the <i>baraita</i>? In the first clause of the mishna, one said: Be betrothed to me with this, be betrothed to me with that, and if one of them is worth one <i>peruta</i> she is betrothed. <b>And</b> Rav and Shmuel explained that <b>it was necessary for</b> the <i>tanna</i> to mention the case of a woman who <b>is eating</b> to teach that despite her immediate benefit, one of the dates must be worth one <i>peruta</i> for her to be betrothed. The phrase: Unless one of them is worth one <i>peruta</i>, indicates that one alone must be worth one <i>peruta</i>. But <b>here</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>lists</b> only <b>groupings;</b> it <b>does not list individual</b> items. The <i>baraita</i> states a case where he said to her: Be betrothed to me, only once, followed by a statement that the three items should serve as the betrothal money. Why, then, does one of them need to be worth one <i>peruta</i>?
The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i> taught? <b>It is</b> that of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who says</b> with regard to the laws of <i>piggul</i>, which is an offering that was sacrificed with the intent to consume an olive-bulk of it after its appointed time or outside the boundaries of where it must be consumed: There is <b>no difference</b> whether he says that he intends to consume: <b>An olive-bulk</b> after its time, <b>an olive-bulk</b> outside its boundaries, i.e., without employing the word: And; <b>or</b> whether he said that he intends to consume <b>an olive-bulk</b> after its time <b>and an olive-bulk</b> outside its boundaries, i.e., employing the word: And. Both expressions <b>are</b> considered <b>individual</b> statements, since he is treating each statement separately, and in neither case does he intend to combine the two amounts. According to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, when one says: With this and with this, each statement is distinct. Consequently, although she derives immediate benefit by eating the dates she receives, she is betrothed only if one of them is worth one <i>peruta</i> on its own.
§ <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with a loan, she is not betrothed,</b> since <b>a loan is given to be spent.</b> Consequently, from the moment the money is lent it no longer belongs to the lender, and he cannot betroth a woman with it. The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that this is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with a loan, she is not betrothed, and some say she is betrothed. What, is it not</b> that they <b>disagree with regard to this:</b> One <b>Sage holds</b> that <b>a loan is given to be spent, and</b> one <b>Sage holds</b> that <b>a loan is not given to be spent?</b>
The Gemara questions this suggestion: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> it that way? <b>Say the latter clause</b> of that same <i>baraita</i>: <b>And they agree with regard to</b> the case of <b>a sale that he acquires</b> it. Although they disagree as to whether one can betroth a woman with a loan he has given her, they agree that a lender can purchase an item from the debtor in exchange for forgiving the money he has lent him. <b>If you say</b> that <b>a loan is given to be spent, with what has he acquired</b> it? There is no money with which to effect an acquisition. No proof can be derived from this <i>baraita</i>, which cannot be understood as stated.
<b>Rav Naḥman says: Our colleague</b> Rav <b>Huna interprets</b> the <i>baraita</i> as referring <b>to other matters</b> and not as referring to a straightforward case of a loan. <b>And with what are we dealing here?</b> A case <b>where he said to her: Be betrothed to me with one hundred dinars, and it was found</b> to be <b>one hundred dinars less</b> one <b>dinar,</b> the missing dinar is considered to be a loan that he has taken from her. One <b>Sage,</b> who said the woman is not betrothed, <b>holds</b> that <b>the matter is embarrassing for her,</b> preventing her <b>from claiming</b> the final dinar from him, and since he has failed to fulfill his statement she is not betrothed. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> who said that she is betrothed, <b>holds</b> that <b>the matter is not embarrassing for her</b> and is not preventing her <b>from claiming</b> the final dinar. He is therefore considered to have fulfilled his statement and borrowed one dinar from her, which he will repay in due course, but she is nevertheless betrothed.
The Gemara asks: <b>But rather,</b> with regard to <b>that which Rabbi Elazar says:</b> If one said to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with one hundred dinars, and he gave her</b> one <b>dinar, she is betrothed and he must</b> later <b>finish</b> giving the full sum; <b>let us say</b> that <b>his statement</b> is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> The Sages <b>say</b> to distinguish between the cases: Where he gave her <b>one hundred dinars less a dinar, the matter is embarrassing for her,</b> preventing her <b>from claiming</b> the final dinar from him, since he has given her almost the entire sum. But if he gave her <b>one hundred dinars less ninety-nine, the matter is not embarrassing for her</b> and is not preventing her <b>from claiming</b> the rest of the dinars. Therefore, all would agree that she is betrothed in the latter case.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the statement of Rav from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who says to a woman: Be betrothed to me with the deposit that I have in your possession, and she went and found that</b> the deposit had been <b>stolen or that</b> it had been <b>lost, if</b> the <b>value of one <i>peruta</i> of it remains</b> she is <b>betrothed</b> with that amount. <b>And if not, she is not betrothed,</b> since there is nothing to effect the betrothal. <b>But</b> if he said to her that he is betrothing her <b>with a loan</b> that he had given her, <b>she is betrothed, even though</b> the <b>value of one <i>peruta</i> of it does not remain. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of Rabbi Meir: A loan</b>

Daf 47b

<b>is like a deposit.</b> The Gemara analyzes this: <b>They disagree only with regard to</b> this: There is one <b>Sage who holds</b> that one can betroth a woman with <b>a loan, even though</b> the <b>value of one <i>peruta</i> does not remain of it. And</b> one <b>Sage holds</b> that if the <b>value of one <i>peruta</i> remains from it, yes,</b> he can betroth her with it, <b>but if</b> the <b>value of one <i>peruta</i> does not remain of it,</b> he <b>cannot. But everyone agrees</b> that if <b>one betroths</b> a woman <b>with a loan, she is betrothed.</b> This presents a difficulty for Rav, who stated that one cannot betroth a woman with a loan.
<b>Rava said to him: And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> it that way? Is <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> fully <b>explainable? It is corrupted</b> and cannot be cited as a proof.
He explains why the <i>baraita</i> must be corrupted: <b>What are the circumstances of this deposit</b> discussed in the <i>baraita</i>? <b>If she assumed</b> financial <b>responsibility</b> to repay the owner <b>for it</b> if it is stolen or lost, it <b>is</b> the same as <b>a loan,</b> as even if it is entirely lost she must still repay its value. <b>If she did not assume</b> financial <b>responsibility for it,</b> then <b>if so, rather than teaching in the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But</b> if he betroths her <b>with a loan</b> that he had given her, <b>she is betrothed despite</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <b>value of one <i>peruta</i> of it does not remain; let him distinguish and teach</b> the distinction <b>within the</b> case <b>itself,</b> as follows: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said,</b> that she is not betrothed if less than the value of one <i>peruta</i> remains from the deposit? <b>If she did not assume</b> financial <b>responsibility upon herself</b> for it. <b>But</b> if <b>she assumed</b> financial <b>responsibility upon herself, even though</b> the <b>value of one <i>peruta</i> did not remain from it, she is betrothed.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> since the wording of the <i>baraita</i> cannot remain as is, <b>answer this</b> way: <b>But</b> if he betroths her <b>with a loan</b> that he had given her, <b>she is not betrothed, despite</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <b>value of one <i>peruta</i> of it remains.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> stated that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of Rabbi Meir: A loan is like a deposit.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree? Rabba said: I found the scholars in the study hall of Rav who were sitting and saying: They disagree with regard to</b> the issue of whether <b>a loan</b> the debtor had not yet begun to spend is <b>in the possession of</b> the <b>owner with regard to</b> the possibility of <b>retraction</b> of the loan by the lender. <b>And the same is true,</b> i.e., they also disagree, <b>with regard to</b> who bears responsibility for <b>accidents.</b>
<b>As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds: A loan stands in the possession of the debtor,</b> i.e., even if it has not been spent, the lender cannot demand the return of the money. <b>And the same is true with regard to</b> responsibility for <b>accidents,</b> i.e., if the money is lost, it is considered lost from the debtor’s possession and he bears responsibility for it. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, <b>holds: A loan</b> that the debtor has not yet begun to spend <b>stands in the possession of the owner, and the same is true with regard to</b> responsibility for <b>accidents.</b> He can therefore betroth a woman with the money he has already lent her, provided that she has not yet begun to spend it.
Rabba continues: <b>And I said to them: With regard to accidents, everyone agrees</b> that it <b>stands in the possession of the debtor</b> and he is responsible for the money. <b>What is the reason?</b> A loan of money is <b>no worse than borrowing</b> an item. <b>Just as</b> in the case of <b>borrowing</b> an item, <b>whereby</b> the item is <b>returned</b> to its owner <b>intact</b> and yet the debtor <b>is liable for accidents,</b> as explicitly stated in the Torah, is it <b>not all the more so</b> that with regard to <b>a loan,</b> which the debtor spends and repays with other money, it should be considered in the debtor’s possession and he should bear responsibility for it? <b>Rather, here</b> the practical difference <b>between them</b> concerns the question of <b>a loan in the possession of the owner with regard to</b> the possibility of <b>retraction</b> of the loan. The first <i>tanna</i> is of the opinion that he cannot retract the loan, whereas Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar holds that he can do so.
The Gemara asks: <b>But rather,</b> with regard to <b>that which Rav Huna says:</b> In the case of <b>one who borrows an ax from his friend</b> for a certain period of time, if <b>he chops</b> wood <b>with it he has acquired it</b> in the sense that the lender cannot demand its immediate return. If <b>he has not chopped</b> wood <b>with it he has not acquired it. Let us say</b> that <b>this <i>halakha</i></b> that Rav Huna <b>stated</b> is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> According to the explanation of Rabba, it would be a dispute between the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No, they disagree only with regard to a loan, which is not returned intact.</b> Since there is no need for the debtor to return the same money to the lender, this means that the money has been transferred to the debtor’s domain, and the first <i>tanna</i> holds that the lender may not retract the loan. <b>But with regard to</b> the <b>borrowing</b> of an item, for example the ax, <b>which is returned intact, everyone agrees</b> that if <b>one chopped with it, yes,</b> he has acquired it and is responsible for it. If <b>he has not chopped with it, he has not acquired it.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that Rav’s statement that one cannot betroth a woman with a loan <b>is subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> The <i>baraita</i> teaches: If one says to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with a promissory note, or if he had a loan in the possession of others and he authorized her to</b> collect the money for herself, <b>Rabbi Meir says she is betrothed and the Rabbis say she is not betrothed.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>this promissory note? If we say</b> it is <b>a promissory note of others</b> who owe him money, <b>this is</b> the same as <b>a loan in the possession of others,</b> and why would the <i>baraita</i> state it twice? <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to <b>her promissory note,</b> i.e., a loan she has taken from him, and <b>they disagree with regard to one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with a loan,</b> whether forgiving the debt by returning the promissory note counts as betrothal money?
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>a promissory note of others, and here</b> they <b>disagree</b> in two cases: <b>In</b> the case of <b>a loan with</b> a promissory <b>note and in</b> the case of <b>a loan by oral</b> agreement.
The Gemara explains: <b>With regard to a loan with</b> a promissory <b>note, concerning what</b> matter <b>do they disagree? They disagree concerning the dispute between Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and the Rabbis, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Letters,</b> i.e., the content of a promissory note, <b>are acquired by</b> merely <b>transferring</b> the document. If the lender hands over a promissory note to a third party, the latter can collect the debt. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And the Rabbis say: Whether one wrote</b> a document of sale for the promissory note <b>but did not transfer</b> the promissory note itself, or <b>whether he transferred</b> the promissory note <b>but did not write</b> a document of sale for it, the recipient <b>has not acquired</b> the promissory note. The recipient acquires it only <b>once</b> the other <b>writes</b> a document of sale <b>and transfers</b> the promissory note.
The suggestion is that one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>is of</b> the opinion that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, and therefore one can betroth a woman by giving her a promissory note even without writing a document of sale for it. <b>And one Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>is not of</b> the opinion that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, and she is not betrothed because she has not received anything.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead the following answer: <b>No one is of</b> the opinion that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and here</b> they <b>disagree with regard to</b> the statement <b>of Rav Pappa, as Rav Pappa says: This one who sells</b> a promissory <b>note to his friend must write</b> the following formula <b>for him: Let it be acquired by you, it and all its liens.</b> Otherwise, the debt discussed in the promissory note is not transferred. One <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>is of</b> the opinion that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rav Pappa. And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>is not of</b> the opinion that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rav Pappa.</b> He holds that the debt is acquired even if one did not write this phrase, and a man can betroth a woman by giving a promissory note to her.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Everyone is of</b> the opinion that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rav Pappa,</b> and even Rabbi Meir agrees that she is betrothed only if he wrote in the document: Let it be acquired by you, it and all its liens. <b>And here</b> they <b>disagree with regard to</b> the statement <b>of Shmuel, as Shmuel says:</b>

Daf 48a

In the case of <b>one who sells a promissory note to another, and</b> he, the seller, <b>went back and forgave</b> the debtor his debt, <b>it is forgiven,</b> since the debtor essentially had a non-transferable obligation to the creditor alone. <b>And even</b> the creditor’s <b>inheritor can forgive</b> the debt. It can be explained <b>that</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Shmuel.</b> Since the man can forgive the debt, the woman will not rely on her ability to collect using the promissory note she has received for her betrothal. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>is not of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Shmuel;</b> the woman relies on her ability to collect using the promissory note and is betrothed.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that everyone is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Shmuel, and here</b> they <b>disagree with regard to a woman</b> who is becoming betrothed. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that <b>a woman relies</b> on a promissory note she receives, since <b>she says</b> to herself: <b>He would not leave</b> aside <b>my</b> benefit <b>and forgive</b> the debt <b>of others. And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>even a woman</b> who received the promissory note for betrothal <b>does not rely</b> on being able to collect the debt, since she is concerned he might forgive it.
Having enumerated several possibilities for the dispute in the case of a loan with a promissory note, the Gemara explains the dispute in the case of a loan by oral agreement: In the case of one who betroths a woman <b>with a loan</b> by <b>oral</b> agreement, <b>with regard to what do they disagree?</b> They disagree <b>with regard to</b> the statement <b>of Rav Huna,</b> who quoted a statement that <b>Rav says, as Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If one said to another: <b>I have one hundred dinars in your possession, give it to so-and-so,</b> if he stated this <b>in the presence of</b> all <b>three</b> parties, i.e., the one who had the money, the one who was the owner of the money, and the intended recipient, the intended recipient <b>has acquired</b> it.
One <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>when Rav said</b> that it can be acquired in the presence of all three parties, <b>this applies in</b> the case of <b>a deposit,</b> since the item is intact. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a loan,</b> which is meant to be spent, he did <b>not</b> rule that it can be transferred this way, since there is no actual money but merely a debt. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds:</b> There <b>is no difference</b> whether it is <b>a loan or a deposit.</b> The third party acquires it in both cases. A woman is therefore betrothed if he gave her a loan in the above manner.
The Gemara again suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that Rav’s statement that one cannot betroth a woman with a loan is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> A <i>baraita</i> teaches: If one says to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with a document, Rabbi Meir says she is not betrothed, and Rabbi Elazar says she is betrothed, and the Rabbis say</b> the court <b>appraises the paper</b> the document is written on: <b>If</b> the paper itself <b>has the value of one <i>peruta</i>, she is betrothed. But if not, she is not betrothed.</b>
The Gemara clarifies the case of this <i>baraita</i>: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>this document? If we say</b> it is <b>a promissory note</b> of a debt owed him <b>by others,</b> then the statement <b>of Rabbi Meir</b> is <b>difficult</b> in light of another statement <b>of Rabbi Meir,</b> as he stated in the previous <i>baraita</i> that a woman can be betrothed by giving her a promissory note. <b>Rather,</b> this <i>baraita</i> must be referring <b>to a promissory note of</b> a debt owed him by <b>her, and they disagree with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with a loan.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says</b> that this is not necessarily so. <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> With a case <b>where he betrothed her with a document</b> of betrothal <b>that had no witnesses to it.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Meir</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he says</b> with regard to a bill of divorce: <b>Signatory witnesses</b> on the bill of divorce <b>effect</b> the divorce, and the same applies to a document of betrothal. Since no witnesses signed the document, it cannot be used for betrothal. <b>And Rabbi Elazar</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he says: Witnesses to the transmission</b> of the bill of divorce <b>effect</b> the divorce, and she is betrothed if the document was handed over in the presence of witnesses. <b>And the Rabbis are uncertain if</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> or <b>if</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar. Therefore,</b> they rule that the betrothal is not effected by means of the document, but it is betrothal effected by means of giving an item worth money. The court <b>appraises the paper: If it has the value of one <i>peruta</i>, she is betrothed. But if not, she is not betrothed.</b>
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that this <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where he wrote</b> the document of betrothal <b>not for her sake,</b> i.e., not for this particular woman’s sake. <b>And they disagree with regard to</b> a statement <b>of Reish Lakish, as Reish Lakish asks: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a document of betrothal that</b> the scribe <b>wrote not for her sake?</b> The Gemara clarifies the question: Do <b>we juxtapose becoming</b> a wife through betrothal <b>to leaving</b> a marriage through divorce and say: <b>Just as</b> in the document that causes her to <b>leave</b> the marriage <b>we require</b> that it be written <b>for her sake, so too,</b> in the document that causes her to <b>become</b> betrothed <b>we require</b> that it be written <b>for her sake as well. Or perhaps we juxtapose</b> different ways of <b>becoming</b> betrothed <b>to each other: Just as</b> in the act of <b>becoming</b> betrothed by means <b>of money we do not require</b> that money be minted <b>for her sake</b> and he can use any money, <b>so too,</b> with regard to the act of <b>becoming</b> betrothed by means <b>of a document, we do not require</b> that it be written <b>for her sake.</b>
<b>After</b> Reish Lakish <b>raised the dilemma,</b> he <b>then resolved it:</b> The verse states: <b>“And she departs</b> out of his house and goes <b>and becomes</b> another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2). The verse thereby <b>juxtaposes</b> the verb <b>becoming to</b> the verb <b>leaving,</b> so a bill of divorce and a document of betrothal must be written for her sake to be valid. <b>One Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>is of</b> the opinion that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish,</b> and maintains that she is not betrothed if the document was not written for her sake. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Elazar, <b>is not of</b> the opinion that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish.</b> The Rabbis remain uncertain, and therefore view the case as betrothal by means of giving an item worth money.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that everyone is of</b> the opinion that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish, and with what are we dealing here?</b> With a case <b>where he wrote</b> the document <b>for her sake but unbeknownst to her. And</b> they <b>disagree concerning the dispute between Rava and Ravina, and Rav Pappa and Rav Sherevya, as it was stated</b> that these <i>amora’im</i> engaged in a dispute with regard to the following issue: If <b>he wrote</b> a document of betrothal <b>for her sake but unbeknownst to her</b> and gave it to her for betrothal, <b>Rava and Ravina say she is betrothed; Rav Pappa and Rav Sherevya say she is not betrothed.</b>
The Gemara again suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that Rav’s statement that one cannot betroth a woman with a loan is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman gave gold to a goldsmith, instructing him: <b>Make bracelets, earrings, and rings for me, and I will be betrothed to you</b> as payment for your work, <b>once he has made them she is betrothed;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: She is not betrothed until money enters her possession.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>this money</b> mentioned by the Rabbis? <b>If we say</b> it means <b>that</b> very <b>money,</b> i.e., the jewelry she requested, then <b>by inference the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that <b>even that</b> same <b>money is also not</b> required to be given for her to be betrothed, but she is betrothed as soon as he made the jewelry. <b>But with what</b> does he betroth her? It is only <b>with</b> the jewelry that she <b>is betrothed,</b> since he has given her nothing but the jewelry. <b>Rather, is</b> the statement of the Rabbis <b>not</b> referring to when he betroths her <b>with</b> the <b>other money,</b> i.e., the payment she owes him for his service, and they hold that she is not betrothed? <b>And conclude from it</b> that Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis <b>disagree with regard to one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with a loan,</b> since the payment she owes him for making the rings is like a loan.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>And</b> it must be <b>they hold that everyone agrees</b> that the obligation to pay <b>a wage is</b> incurred continuously <b>from the beginning</b> of the period he was hired <b>to</b> its <b>end,</b> i.e., the obligation to pay for a service begins when the hired party starts to work, and the sum owed increases as he proceeds. <b>And it is</b> therefore <b>a loan,</b> as when he gives her the finished article she was already obligated to pay for the work he had performed earlier. <b>What, is it not</b> the case that they <b>disagree with regard to this,</b> i.e., <b>that</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that in the case of <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with a loan, she is betrothed, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that in the case of <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with a loan, she is not betrothed?</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> it is possible that <b>everyone</b> agrees that in the case of <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with a loan, she is not betrothed, and here</b> they in fact <b>disagree</b> over the question of whether or not the obligation to pay <b>a wage is</b> incurred continuously <b>from the beginning</b> of the period he was hired <b>to</b> its <b>end.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds:</b>

Daf 48b

The obligation to pay <b>a wage is</b> incurred <b>only at the end</b> of the labor, when he returns the item to her. Since it is at this stage that he forgives the money due him and converts it to money for betrothal, it was never considered to be a loan. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds:</b> The obligation to pay <b>a wage is</b> incurred continuously <b>from the beginning</b> of the period he was hired <b>to</b> its <b>end,</b> at which point the debt is viewed as a loan that has accumulated throughout the period of hire.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that everyone agrees</b> that the obligation to pay <b>a wage is</b> incurred continuously <b>from the beginning</b> of the period he was hired <b>to</b> its <b>end. And</b> they also agree that in the case of <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with a loan, she is not betrothed. And here</b> the case is not discussing a hired worker but a contractor, who is entitled to payment only upon completion of the job, and they <b>disagree with regard to</b> the question of whether or not <b>a craftsman acquires</b> ownership rights through <b>enhancement of the vessel.</b> Is it viewed that the contractor has acquired the item by improving it, and he is then selling it back to the one who hired him? Or is he merely being paid for his labor? One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds: A craftsman acquires</b> ownership rights <b>through enhancement of the vessel,</b> and since he partly owns the jewelry he can betroth a woman with it. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds: A craftsman does not acquire</b> ownership rights <b>through enhancement of the vessel.</b>
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that everyone agrees</b> that <b>a craftsman does not acquire</b> ownership rights <b>through enhancement of the vessel, and</b> also that the obligation to pay <b>a wage is</b> incurred continuously <b>from the beginning</b> of the period he was hired <b>to</b> its <b>end. And</b> everyone also agrees that in the case of <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with a loan, she is not betrothed. And with what are we dealing here?</b> A case <b>where he added a jewel [<i>nofekh</i>] of his own for her, as</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that if a man betroths a woman with <b>a loan and one <i>peruta</i>, his mind</b> is focused <b>on the <i>peruta</i>. And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>his mind</b> is focused <b>on the loan.</b> Here too, the question is whether her intention is to become betrothed with the payment for the work, which is a loan, or with the jewel he added.
<b>And</b> they disagree <b>in the dispute</b> between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i>. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:4): If one says to a woman: Be betrothed to me <b>with the payment</b> for that <b>which I have worked for you, she is not betrothed</b> because it is a loan, since she already owes him the money. But if he said: Be betrothed to me <b>with the payment</b> for that <b>which I will work for you, she is betrothed,</b> as at the moment he becomes entitled to the money it is considered as though he gives it to her for her betrothal. <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> If he says: <b>With the payment</b> for that <b>which I will work for you, she is not betrothed,</b> as Rabbi Natan holds that the obligation to pay a wage is incurred continuously from the beginning of the period he was hired to its end, which means that by the end of the job it is a loan. <b>And</b> this is <b>all the more so</b> if he says: <b>With the payment</b> for that <b>which I have worked for you.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> cites a third opinion: <b>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says: Actually, they said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>whether</b> he said: <b>With the payment</b> for that <b>which I have worked for you, or: With the payment</b> for that <b>which I will work for you, she is not betrothed. But if he added a <i>nofekh</i> of his own for her, she is betrothed.</b>
The Gemara clarifies the dispute: The difference <b>between the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Natan</b> concerns <b>a wage:</b> Is the obligation incurred continuously or only at the end? The difference <b>between Rabbi Natan and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi</b> is the issue of <b>a loan and one <i>peruta</i>.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Natan, <b>holds</b> that if a man betroths a woman with <b>a loan and one <i>peruta</i> his mind</b> is focused <b>on the loan,</b> and his jewel is disregarded. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds</b> that <b>his mind</b> is focused <b>on the <i>peruta</i>,</b> and she is betrothed with the jewel.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a man said to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with this cup of wine, and it was found</b> to be a cup <b>of honey;</b> or if he said: With this cup <b>of honey, and it was found</b> to be a cup <b>of wine;</b> or if he said: <b>With this dinar</b> made <b>of silver, and it was found</b> to be made <b>of gold;</b> or if he said: With this dinar made <b>of gold, and it was found</b> to be made <b>of silver;</b> or if he said: <b>On the condition that I am wealthy, and he was found</b> to be <b>poor;</b> or if he said: On the condition that I am <b>poor, and he was found</b> to be <b>wealthy, she is not betrothed</b> in any of these cases. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: If he misled her to</b> her <b>advantage</b> by giving her something better than what he stated, or if his status was greater than he claimed, she is <b>betrothed.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to one who says to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with this cup,</b> without further specification, it <b>is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:3) that the betrothal is effected <b>with</b> the cup <b>and</b> also <b>with its contents. And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that the betrothal is effected <b>with</b> the cup <b>but not with its contents. And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in yet <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that the betrothal is effected <b>with its contents but not with it.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this is <b>not difficult:</b> The <i>baraitot</i> do not contradict one another since <b>this</b> one is stated <b>with regard to</b> a cup of <b>water, this</b> one is stated <b>with regard to</b> a cup of <b>wine,</b> and <b>this</b> one is stated <b>with regard to</b> a cup of <b>oil.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that Rabbi Shimon says: <b>If he misled her to</b> her <b>advantage,</b> she is <b>betrothed.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Shimon accept</b> the statement of the mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 83a) that if one sells <b>wine and it was found</b> to be <b>vinegar,</b> or if he sold <b>vinegar and it was found</b> to be <b>wine, both</b> the buyer and the seller <b>can retract from</b> the sale? Although wine is more valuable than vinegar, the seller is not considered to have defrauded the buyer, in which case only the buyer could retract. <b>Apparently,</b> this is because <b>there is</b> one <b>for whom</b> it is <b>preferable</b> to have <b>vinegar and there is</b> one <b>for whom</b> it is <b>preferable</b> to have <b>wine.</b> Consequently, receiving wine instead of vinegar is not objectively better. If so, <b>here too, there is</b> one <b>for whom</b> it is <b>preferable</b> to have <b>silver and</b> it is <b>not preferable for him</b> to have <b>gold.</b> Why does Rabbi Shimon say that she is betrothed if he gave her gold instead of silver?
<b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi says: I found Abaye sitting and explaining</b> this mishna <b>to his son: With what are we dealing here?</b> With a case <b>where one said to his agent: Lend me a dinar</b> made <b>of silver and go and betroth for me such and such a woman</b> with it, <b>and he went and lent</b> him a dinar made <b>of gold</b> and betrothed her with that. One <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that he is <b>particular</b> in his requirement that a silver dinar be used, and consequently she is not betrothed. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds</b> that <b>he is</b> merely <b>indicating</b> his position <b>to him.</b> He stated silver only as a guideline, but does not care if it is gold.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so,</b> if the case involves an agent, why does the mishna state: <b>Be betrothed to me?</b> The mishna <b>should have</b> stated: <b>Be betrothed to him.</b> Furthermore, why does it say: <b>He misled her to</b> her <b>advantage?</b> The mishna <b>should have</b> stated: <b>He misled him to</b> his <b>advantage,</b> as the agent did not mislead the woman but the one who designated him. Similarly, there is a difficulty with regard to the wording: If it was <b>found</b> to be made of gold, as according to this explanation, <b>from the outset,</b> when the agent gave it to the woman, <b>it was also</b> known to be made <b>of gold.</b> This fact was not discovered later.
<b>Rather, Rava says: I and the lion of the group explained it,</b> and the Gemara interjects: <b>And who is</b> the lion of the group? It is <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin: With what are we dealing here?</b> With a case <b>where she said to her agent: Go and accept my betrothal for me from so-and-so, who said to me: Be betrothed to me with a dinar</b> made <b>of silver, and</b> the prospective husband <b>went and gave</b> the agent <b>a dinar</b> made <b>of gold.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that she is <b>particular</b> about becoming betrothed with a silver dinar rather than a gold one. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds</b> that <b>she is</b> merely <b>indicating</b> her position <b>to him</b> but does not care what the agent receives from the man. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of: It was <b>found,</b> as it was evident from the outset that it was gold? The mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the coin <b>was wrapped in a cloth,</b> and the agent was unaware that he was receiving a different dinar from what she had requested.
<b>Abaye said:</b> With regard to <b>Rabbi Shimon, and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, and Rabbi Elazar, they all hold</b> that when one instructs an agent in such a manner <b>he is</b> merely <b>indicating</b> his position <b>to him,</b> as opposed to expressing an insistence on certain details. If the agent makes insignificant changes to the instructions the agency is still fulfilled. <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> holds this, as seen in <b>this</b> mishna <b>that we</b> just <b>said. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> holds this, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 160a):

Daf 49a

In <b>an ordinary document, its witnesses</b> are to sign <b>inside it,</b> i.e., on the written side of the paper. In a folded and <b>tied</b> document, <b>its witnesses</b> are to sign <b>on the back of it.</b> With regard to <b>an ordinary</b> document <b>whose witnesses wrote</b> their signatures <b>on the back of it, or a tied</b> document <b>whose witnesses wrote</b> their signatures <b>inside of it, both of these</b> are <b>not valid. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel says: A tied</b> document <b>whose witnesses wrote</b> their signatures <b>inside of it</b> is <b>valid, because one can transform it into an ordinary</b> document by untying it. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Everything</b> is <b>in accordance with regional custom.</b> If an ordinary document is generally used and one wrote a bound one, or vice versa, the document is invalid.
<b>And we discussed it: And does the first <i>tanna</i> not accept</b> that one should follow the <b>regional custom?</b> It is not reasonable that he should take issue with such a basic concept. <b>And Rav Ashi says</b> that they have a dispute in a case where one instructed a scribe to write a document for him: If they are <b>in a place where the custom is</b> to write <b>an ordinary</b> document, <b>and he made a tied one for him; alternatively,</b> if they are <b>in a place where the custom is</b> to write <b>a tied</b> document, <b>and he made an ordinary</b> one <b>for him;</b> in both of these cases, <b>everyone agrees that</b> he was <b>certainly particular</b> in his instructions to the agent that he should follow the regional custom, and if the latter deviated from the custom the document is invalid.
The situation <b>in which they disagree</b> is where they are <b>in a place where the custom is</b> to use <b>either an ordinary</b> document <b>or a tied</b> one, <b>and</b> the one requesting the document <b>said to</b> the scribe: <b>Make an ordinary</b> document <b>for me, and</b> the scribe <b>went and made a tied</b> document <b>for him.</b> In such a case, one <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that the one requesting the document was <b>particular</b> about wanting an ordinary document, and since the scribe wrote a tied document, it is considered to have been written without his consent. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <b>holds</b> that the one requesting the document merely <b>indicating</b> his <b>position to</b> the scribe, stating that if the scribe wanted to save himself the trouble of writing a tied document there would no objection.
<b>Rabbi Elazar</b> also holds that when one instructs an agent in such a manner he is merely indicating his position to him, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 65a): If there was <b>a woman who said</b> to her agent: <b>Receive my bill of divorce for me</b> from my husband <b>in such and such a place, and he received her bill of divorce for her elsewhere, it is invalid. And Rabbi Elazar deems it valid. Apparently, he holds</b> that <b>she is</b> merely <b>indicating a place to him</b> where he can receive the bill of divorce, but she does not insist that he accept it in that particular spot.
§ <b>Ulla says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> in the mishna between the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Shimon is only where he misled her <b>with enhanced monetary</b> value, i.e., he gave her something worth more than the item he had stipulated. <b>But</b> where he misled her <b>with enhanced lineage,</b> so that she was under the impression that his genealogy was less impressive than it in fact is, <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>she is not betrothed. What is the reason</b> for this? A woman says: <b>I do not desire a shoe that is larger than my foot.</b> She does not wish to marry a man whose social standing is far greater than her own. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:6): <b>Rabbi Shimon concedes</b> that <b>if he misled her with enhanced lineage, she is not betrothed.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi says:</b> The wording of <b>the mishna is also precise, as</b> the following mishna (49b) <b>teaches:</b> If one betroths a woman and states that the betrothal is: <b>On the condition that I am a priest, and he was found</b> to be <b>a Levite;</b> or: On the condition that I am <b>a Levite, and he was found</b> to be <b>a priest;</b> or: On the condition that I am <b>a Gibeonite,</b> a people prohibited by rabbinic law from marrying into the congregation, i.e., from marrying a Jew of fit lineage, <b>and he was found</b> to be <b>a <i>mamzer</i>,</b> who is prohibited by Torah law from marrying into the congregation; or: On the condition that I am <b>a <i>mamzer</i>, and he was found</b> to be <b>a Gibeonite,</b> in all of these cases she is not betrothed. <b>And Rabbi Shimon does not disagree</b> with these rulings. This indicates that if one misled a woman with regard to his lineage, Rabbi Shimon concedes that she is not betrothed.
<b>Mar bar Rav Ashi objects to this</b> inference: <b>But</b> what about <b>that</b> which <b>is taught</b> in the same mishna: If one betroths a woman and states that the betrothal is: <b>On the condition that I have a grown daughter or maidservant, and he does not have</b> one; or if one betroths a woman <b>on the condition that he does not have</b> a grown daughter or maidservant <b>and he does have</b> one, the latter of <b>which is</b> an issue of <b>enhanced monetary</b> value, as the difference between one who has a maidservant and one who does not impacts how hard the woman will have to work in the home; in these cases will you <b>also</b> say <b>that</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>does not disagree</b> simply because the mishna does not mention his opinion in that case?
<b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>he disagrees in the first clause</b> of the mishna with regard to enhanced monetary value, <b>and the same is true with regard to the latter clause,</b> i.e., he also disagrees in that clause, and it was not necessary to state his dispute another time. <b>Here too,</b> with regard to lineage, <b>he disagrees in the first clause, and the same is true with regard to the latter clause.</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> where <b>both this</b> case <b>and that</b> case involve an inaccuracy <b>of enhanced monetary</b> value, it is possible that <b>he disagreed in the first clause and the same is true in the last clause,</b> and the mishna did not need to restate his opinion. But <b>here,</b> where it <b>is</b> a case <b>of enhanced lineage,</b> which is a different issue, <b>if it is so that</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>disagrees, let him teach</b> that explicitly. The fact that no dispute is recorded in the case of enhanced lineage is proof that he concedes in that case.
<b>If you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Here too,</b> the issue of a daughter or maidservant involves <b>enhanced lineage,</b> not enhanced monetary value. His statement should be understood differently. <b>Do you maintain</b> that <b>what</b> is the meaning of his statement that he has <b>a grown</b> daughter or maidservant; that she is <b>actually grown</b> up, so that she can be of help to his wife? That is not the meaning of his statement. Rather, <b>what</b> is the meaning of: <b>Grown?</b> That she <b>grows</b> and plaits hair, i.e., he has a daughter or maidservant who is a hairdresser. Why might the potential bride view this as a drawback? <b>Because she</b> can <b>say:</b> It is <b>not satisfactory for me</b> to live in the house with a hairdresser, <b>as she will take words</b> she hears <b>from me and will go pass</b> them <b>before my neighbors,</b> meaning she will gossip about me to others. This concern is more akin to a matter of lineage than a matter of monetary value.
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> If one said to a woman: Be betrothed to me <b>on the condition that I am literate</b> with regard to the Torah, <b>once he has read three verses in the synagogue she is betrothed. Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that she is not betrothed <b>until he reads and translates</b> the verses. The Gemara asks: Does Rabbi Yehuda mean that <b>one translates</b> according to <b>his own understanding? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Megilla</i> 3:21) that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One who translates a verse literally is a liar,</b> since he distorts the meaning of the text, <b>and</b> conversely, <b>one who adds</b> his own translation <b>is</b> tantamount to one who <b>curses and blasphemes</b> God? <b>Rather,</b> to <b>which translation</b> is Rabbi Yehuda referring? He is referring to <b>our</b> accepted <b>translation.</b>
<b>And this statement applies</b> only <b>if he said to her: I am literate, but</b> if <b>he said to her: I am a reader,</b> this indicates that he is an expert in the reading of the Torah, and she is not betrothed <b>unless</b> he knows how <b>to read the Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings with precision.</b>
The Gemara discusses a similar case: If one said to a woman: Be betrothed to me <b>on the condition that I study [<i>shoneh</i>], Ḥizkiyya says</b> it means that he studies <b><i>halakhot</i>, and Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> it means that he studies <b>Torah,</b> i.e., the written Torah.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rabbi Yoḥanan from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>Mishna? Rabbi Meir says <i>halakhot</i>, Rabbi Yehuda says homiletics.</b> Neither of them, however, says that it refers to the written Torah.

Daf 49b

<b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>Torah,</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan said? It is <b>homiletic</b> interpretation <b>of the Torah. And this statement applies</b> only <b>if he said to her: I study [<i>taneina</i>]. But</b> if <b>he says to her: I am a <i>tanna</i> [<i>tanna ana</i>],</b> she is not betrothed <b>unless he studies <i>halakha</i>,</b> i.e., Mishna, <b><i>Sifra</i> and <i>Sifrei</i>, and <i>Tosefta</i>.</b>
If a man says to a woman: Be betrothed to me <b>on the condition that I am a student</b> of Torah, <b>one does not say</b> that he must be a student who is scholarly <b>like Shimon ben Azzai or like Shimon ben Zoma,</b> who were called students despite their great knowledge, as they were never ordained. <b>Rather,</b> it means <b>anyone who,</b> when <b>he is asked one matter in any topic of his studies,</b> responds appropriately <b>and can say</b> what he has learned, <b>and</b> this suffices <b>even</b> if his statement was <b>in</b> the <b>tractate of <i>Kalla</i>.</b> Similarly, if a man says to a woman: Be betrothed to me <b>on the condition that I am a scholar, one does not say</b> that he must be <b>like the scholars of Yavne, like Rabbi Akiva and his colleagues. Rather,</b> it is referring to <b>anyone who,</b> when <b>he is asked</b> about <b>a matter of wisdom on any topic</b> related to the Torah, responds appropriately <b>and can say</b> what he has learned.
If a man says to a woman: Be betrothed to me <b>on the condition that I am strong, one does not say</b> that he must be as strong <b>as Abner ben Ner,</b> King Saul’s cousin and general, <b>or</b> as strong <b>as Joab ben Zeruiah,</b> King David’s nephew and general. <b>Rather,</b> it means <b>anyone of whom others are afraid due to his strength.</b> If a man says to a woman: Be betrothed to me <b>on the condition that I am wealthy, one does not say</b> he must be as wealthy <b>as Rabbi Elazar ben Ḥarsom or</b> as wealthy <b>as Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, but</b> rather it can refer to <b>anyone who is honored by the members of his town due to his wealth.</b>
If one says to a woman: Be betrothed to me <b>on the condition that I am</b> a <b>righteous man,</b> then <b>even if</b> he was <b>a completely wicked man she is betrothed,</b> as <b>perhaps</b> in the meantime <b>he had thoughts of repentance in his mind</b> and is now righteous. Similarly, if one says to a woman: Be betrothed to me <b>on the condition that I am a wicked man,</b> then <b>even</b> if he was <b>a completely righteous man she is betrothed,</b> as <b>perhaps he had thoughts of idol worship in his mind,</b> a serious sin that would earn him the label of wicked.
§ Apropos the discussion with regard to various attributes, the Gemara cites a related statement: <b>Ten <i>kav</i></b> of <b>wisdom descended to the world; Eretz Yisrael took nine</b> of them <b>and all</b> the rest of <b>the world</b> took <b>one. Ten <i>kav</i></b> of <b>beauty descended to the world; Jerusalem took nine and all</b> the rest of <b>the world in its entirety</b> took <b>one. Ten <i>kav</i></b> of <b>wealth descended to the world; Rome took nine and all</b> the rest of <b>the world in its entirety</b> took <b>one. Ten <i>kav</i></b> of <b>poverty descended to the world; Babylonia took nine and all</b> the rest of <b>the world in its entirety</b> took <b>one. Ten <i>kav</i></b> of <b>arrogance descended to the world; Eilam took nine and all</b> the rest of <b>the world in its entirety</b> took <b>one.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But did arrogance not descend to Babylonia? But isn’t it written: “Then I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold there came forth two women, and the wind was in their wings, for they had wings like the wings of a stork. And they lifted up the measure between the earth and the heaven. Then I said to the angel that spoke with me: ‘To where do they take the measure?’ And he said to me: ‘To build her a house in the land of Shinar’”</b> (Zechariah 5:9–11). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This</b> refers to <b>flattery and arrogance that descended to Babylonia,</b> i.e., Shinar. This indicates that arrogance reached Babylonia as well.
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it descended to here,</b> to Babylonia, <b>and it made its way to there,</b> to Eilam. The language of the verse <b>is also precise, as it teaches: “To build her a house,”</b> which indicates that the original intention was to build a house in Babylonia, but it was not built there. The Gemara comments: <b>Conclude from it</b> that arrogance did not remain in Babylonia.
The Gemara further asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t the Master say: A sign of arrogance</b> is <b>poverty, and there is poverty in Babylonia,</b> and not in Eilam. The Gemara answers: To <b>what</b> kind of <b>poverty</b> is this referring? It is <b>poverty with regard to Torah,</b> which was characteristic of Eilam. <b>As it is written: “We have a little sister, and she has no breasts”</b> (Song of Songs 8:8), <b>and Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This</b> refers to <b>Eilam, whose</b> inhabitants <b>merited to learn but did not merit to teach.</b> They did not produce Torah scholars capable of imparting their wisdom to others.
The Gemara returns to its list of endowments of various groups: <b>Ten <i>kav</i></b> of <b>strength descended to the world; the Persians took nine</b> and the rest of the world took one. <b>Ten <i>kav</i></b> of <b>lice descended to the world; Media took nine</b> and the rest of the world took one. <b>Ten <i>kav</i></b> of <b>witchcraft descended to the world; Egypt took nine</b> and the rest of the world took one. <b>Ten <i>kav</i></b> of <b>plagues descended to the world; pigs,</b> which carry disease, <b>took nine</b> and the rest of the world took one. <b>Ten <i>kav</i></b> of <b>licentiousness descended to the world; Arabia took nine</b> and the rest of the world took one.
<b>Ten <i>kav</i></b> of <b>brazenness descended to the world; Meishan,</b> near Babylonia, <b>took nine</b> and the rest of the world took one. <b>Ten <i>kav</i></b> of <b>conversation descended to the world; women took nine</b> and the rest of the world took one. <b>Ten <i>kav</i></b> of <b>drunkenness descended to the world; the Kushites took nine</b> and the rest of the world took one. <b>Ten <i>kav</i></b> of <b>sleep descended to the world; slaves took nine and all</b> the rest of <b>the world in its entirety took one.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one said to a woman: Be betrothed to me <b>on the condition that I am a priest, and he was found</b> to be <b>a Levite;</b> or if he said: <b>A Levite, and he was found</b> to be <b>a priest;</b> or if he said: Be betrothed to me on the condition that I am <b>a Gibeonite,</b> a people prohibited by rabbinic law from marrying into the congregation, i.e., from marrying a Jew of fit lineage, <b>and he was found</b> to be <b>a <i>mamzer</i>,</b> who is prohibited by Torah law to marry into the congregation; or he said: <b>A <i>mamzer</i>, and he was found</b> to be <b>a Gibeonite;</b> or if he said: Be betrothed to me on the condition that I am <b>a resident of</b> a small <b>town, and he was found</b> to be <b>a resident of</b> a large <b>city;</b> or he said: <b>A resident of a city, and he was found</b> to be <b>a resident of a town;</b> or if he said: Be betrothed to me <b>on the condition that my house is close to the bathhouse, and it was found</b> to be <b>far;</b> or he said: <b>Far</b> from the bathhouse, <b>and it was found</b> to be <b>close,</b> she is not betrothed.
Or if he said that she is betrothed to him <b>on the condition that he has a grown daughter or a maidservant, and he does not have</b> one, <b>or on the condition that he does not have</b> one <b>and he has</b> one; or <b>on the condition that he has no sons, and he has</b> sons, <b>or on the condition that he has</b> sons <b>and he does not have</b> sons, then she is not betrothed. <b>And in all these</b> cases, <b>despite</b> the fact <b>that she</b> later <b>stated: I intended to become betrothed to him nevertheless,</b> whether or not he fulfilled the condition, <b>she is not betrothed. And similarly,</b> if it was <b>she who misled him</b> by making the betrothal conditional upon a statement of hers that turned out to be incorrect, the betrothal will not take effect.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who sold his property with the intention of ascending to Eretz Yisrael, but at the time that he sold</b> the property <b>he did not say anything</b> with regard to his intention. Ultimately, he did not ascend to Eretz Yisrael, and he wished to renege on the sale. <b>Rava said:</b> Since he did not explicitly state that he was selling his property on the condition that he ascend to Eretz Yisrael, <b>that is</b> an unspoken <b>matter that</b> remained <b>in the heart, and</b> unspoken <b>matters that</b> remain <b>in the heart are not</b> significant <b>matters.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where does Rava</b> learn <b>this</b> principle? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>from that which we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:

Daf 50a

With regard to one who pledges to bring a burnt-offering, the verse states: “If his offering be a burnt-offering of the herd, he shall offer it a male without blemish; he shall bring it to the door of the Tent of Meeting, according to his will, before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:3). The seemingly superfluous words <b>“he shall offer it” teaches that they coerce him</b> to bring the offering. I <b>might</b> have thought that it can be offered entirely <b>against his will,</b> by taking it from his possession and sacrificing it; therefore, <b>the verse states: “According to his will.”</b>
<b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? <b>They coerce him until he says: I want</b> to bring the offering. The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> should this be effective; <b>but in his heart it is not satisfactory for him</b> to bring the offering, and it is not according to his will. <b>Rather, is it not because we say:</b> Unspoken <b>matters that</b> remain <b>in the heart are not</b> significant <b>matters,</b> and his intention is rendered irrelevant by his explicit statement? The Gemara rejects this: <b>But perhaps there it is different, since</b> it <b>is clear to us that it is satisfactory for him to</b> achieve <b>atonement,</b> despite his earlier statement to the contrary.
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara derives a proof <b>from the latter clause</b> of that same <i>baraita</i>: <b>And similarly, you find with bills of divorce of women and</b> bills <b>of manumission of slaves</b> that when the court rules that a man must divorce his wife or free his slave and he does not want to, <b>they coerce him until he says: I want</b> to divorce my wife, or: I want to free my slave. <b>But why</b> should this be effective; <b>but in his heart it is not satisfactory for him</b> to divorce her or to free him. <b>Rather, is it not because we say</b> that unspoken <b>matters that</b> remain <b>in the heart are not</b> significant <b>matters?</b> The Gemara rejects this proof as well: <b>But perhaps there it is different, because it is a mitzva to listen</b> to the <b>statements of the Sages,</b> and the assumption is that when he is required to divorce his wife or free his slave, his true desire is to perform the mitzva.
<b>Rather, Rav Yosef says:</b> The proof is <b>from here</b> (64a): In the case of <b>one who betroths a woman and he said: I thought that she was</b> the daughter of <b>a priest, and she is</b> in fact the daughter of <b>a Levite;</b> or I thought <b>she</b> was the daughter of <b>a Levite, and she is found</b> to be the daughter of <b>a priest;</b> I thought <b>she</b> was <b>poor, and she is wealthy;</b> or I thought <b>she</b> was <b>wealthy, and she is poor, she is betrothed</b> despite his mistaken assumption, <b>because she did not mislead him. But why</b> is she betrothed; <b>but he said: I thought</b> that she had a different characteristic, and he betrothed her with that in mind? <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>because we say</b> that unspoken <b>matters that</b> remain <b>in the heart are not</b> significant <b>matters. Abaye said to him: Perhaps it is different there, since</b> the ruling there is that she requires a bill of divorce only <b>as a stringency,</b> and they are not definitively betrothed.
<b>Rather, Abaye said</b> that the proof is <b>from here,</b> from the mishna: <b>And in all these</b> cases, <b>despite</b> the fact <b>that she</b> later <b>stated: I intended to become betrothed to him nevertheless, she is not betrothed. But why</b> should her betrothal not take effect at all; <b>but she said: I intended</b> to become betrothed? This clause of the mishna teaches that unspoken matters that remain in the heart are not significant. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>But perhaps it is different there, as, since he stipulated</b> explicitly that a certain condition was true, <b>it is not in her power to uproot his condition</b> through thoughts alone.
<b>Rather, Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin says: There was an incident</b> of this kind in <b>Rav Ḥisda’s study hall, and Rav Ḥisda</b> brought the case to <b>Rav Huna’s study hall, and they resolved it from this</b> mishna (<i>Me’ila</i> 21a): In the case of <b>one who says to his agent: Bring me</b> such and such an item <b>from the window</b> ledge <b>or from the box [<i>hadeluskema</i>],</b> forgetting that the item in question was consecrated property and any use of it would constitute misuse of consecrated property, <b>and</b> the agent <b>brought it to him,</b> then <b>although</b> at that point <b>the owner said: My intention was</b> that you bring the item <b>only from this</b> other place, <b>once he brought</b> the item <b>to him from that</b> place that he had mentioned, once the agent uses it <b>the owner</b> is liable for <b>having misused</b> consecrated property. <b>But why</b> should he be responsible; <b>but he said: My intention</b> was for the other place, so the agent did not fulfill his mission. <b>Rather, is it not because we say</b> that unspoken <b>matters that</b> remain <b>in the heart are not</b> significant <b>matters?</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>But perhaps it is different there,</b> since it is suspected <b>that he is coming to exempt himself from</b> bringing <b>an offering</b> for his misuse by claiming that he intended a different item. Since there is cause to question the truth of his statement that he had intended that the agent bring the item from the other place, his claim is not accepted. This cannot serve as a proof that in general, unspoken matters that remain in the heart are not significant.
The Gemara responds: If all he wanted to do was exempt himself from the obligation to bring an offering, <b>he could have said</b> that the misuse <b>was intentional,</b> as one who misuses consecrated property intentionally is not obligated to bring an offering. Therefore, there is no cause to question the truth of his statement that he had intended that the agent bring the item from the other place. The Gemara counters: <b>It is not common</b> for <b>a person to place himself</b> in the category of <b>a wicked person</b> by claiming to have committed a transgression intentionally. Therefore, once again, there is cause to question the truth of his statement that he had intended that the agent bring the item from the other place.
The Gemara continues to ask: To exempt himself from the obligation to bring an offering, <b>he could have said:</b> After the agent left <b>I remembered</b> that it was consecrated property. Such a claim would also have rendered him exempt, <b>as we learned</b> in that same mishna (<i>Me’ila</i> 21a): If one sent an agent to bring a particular item, and <b>the owner remembered</b> that it was consecrated <b>and the agent did not remember</b> but proceeded to fulfill his agency, it is <b>the agent</b> who has <b>misused</b> consecrated property and is liable to bring an offering, not the one who designated him, since the latter remembered and canceled the agency. There is no cause to question the truth of his statement that he had intended that the agent bring the item from the other place. Therefore, the fact that this state-ment is not accepted can serve as a proof that in general, unspoken matters that remain in the heart are not significant.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who sold his property with the intention of ascending to Eretz Yisrael</b> and explicitly stated this intention to the buyer. <b>He ascended</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>but he was not able to settle</b> there. Upon his return to Babylonia, he sought to nullify the sale. <b>Rava said: Whoever ascends</b> to Eretz Yisrael does so <b>with the intention of settling</b> there, <b>and</b> as <b>he was not able to settle</b> there he can nullify the sale. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version, that Rava said the opposite: <b>He intended to ascend</b> to Eretz Yisrael, <b>and he ascended,</b> so he cannot nullify the sale.
The Gemara relates a similar incident: There was <b>a certain man who sold his property with the intention of ascending to Eretz Yisrael,</b> but <b>ultimately he did not ascend</b> there. <b>Rav Ashi said: If he</b> had <b>wanted</b> to do so, <b>he could have ascended.</b> Since the matter depended upon him, there are no grounds for nullifying the sale. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> Rav Ashi said as follows: <b>If he</b> had <b>wanted</b> to do so, <b>couldn’t he have ascended?</b> Since nothing prevented him from leaving, the sale is not nullified. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between</b> the two versions of Rav Ashi’s statement? The Gemara answers: <b>There is a</b> difference <b>between them</b> in a case <b>when circumstances beyond his control</b> occurred <b>along the way,</b> preventing him from going. According to the first version of the statement of Rav Ashi, the sale is upheld; but according to the second version, where Rav Ashi responded in the form of a question, the implication is that if there actually had been something that prevented him from ascending, the sale would be nullified.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who says to his agent: Go and betroth for me so-and-so in such and such a place, and</b> the agent <b>went and betrothed her in a different place, she is not betrothed,</b> since he instructed that the betrothal take place in a particular location. But if he said: Go and betroth the woman for me, <b>she is in such and such a place; and</b> the agent <b>betrothed her in a different place, she is betrothed,</b> since he did not mean that the agent should betroth her specifically there, but was merely telling him where to find her.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: <b>And we also learned</b> in a mishna <b>with regard to bills of divorce</b> (<i>Gittin</i> 65a): With regard to <b>one who says</b> to his agents: <b>Give this bill of divorce to my wife in such and such a place, and they gave</b> it <b>to her in another place,</b> the divorce is <b>invalid.</b> If he said to them: <b>She is in such and such a place, and they gave</b> it <b>to her in another place,</b> it is <b>valid.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> with regard to both betrothal and divorce, <b>because had</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught us</b> only <b>with regard to betrothal,</b> you might say: <b>In a case when he is coming to draw her near</b> to him through betrothal, he thinks: <b>They love me in this place and will not say</b> negative <b>remarks about me,</b> but <b>they hate me in that place and will say</b> negative <b>remarks about me.</b> Therefore, he told the agent to perform the betrothal in a certain place and is particular that it take place only there. <b>But with regard to bills of divorce, when he is coming to distance her</b> from him, you might <b>say he does not care</b> where the divorce itself is performed. The <i>tanna</i> therefore informs us that this is not the case.
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>had taught us</b> only <b>with regard to divorce,</b> I would have said that he is particular only in the case of divorce, because <b>in this place</b> it is <b>acceptable for him to degrade himself</b> through divorce, whereas <b>in that place</b> it is <b>not acceptable for him</b> to do so; <b>but with regard to betrothal,</b> which involves no degradation, you might <b>say he does not care</b> where he betroths her. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to state the <i>halakha</i> in both cases.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who betroths a woman on the condition that there are no vows</b> incumbent <b>upon her</b> to fulfill, <b>and it was found that there were vows</b> incumbent <b>upon her</b> to fulfill, <b>she is not betrothed,</b> since his condition was not fulfilled. If he <b>married her without specification, and it was found that there were vows</b> incumbent <b>upon her</b> to fulfill, the marriage takes effect. Nevertheless, he has the right to divorce her, and <b>she is divorced without</b> receiving payment of her <b>marriage contract,</b> as it is assumed that he would not have married her had he known that she was limited by her vows.
Similarly, if he betrothed her <b>on the condition that there are no blemishes upon her, and she was discovered to have blemishes, she is not betrothed.</b> In a case where he <b>married her without specification and she was discovered to have blemishes,</b> he has the right to divorce her, and <b>she is divorced without</b> receiving payment of her <b>marriage contract.</b> As to what is defined as a blemish, the rule is <b>that all the blemishes that disqualify priests</b> from performing the Temple service, as detailed in tractate <i>Bekhorot</i>, also <b>disqualify women</b> from receiving their marriage contract in case of divorce.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: <b>And we also learned</b> a mishna <b>like this with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>marriage contracts,</b> as the same mishna appears in tractate <i>Ketubot</i> (72b). The Gemara explains: <b>Here</b> it <b>was necessary for</b> the <i>tanna</i> to mention this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>betrothal,</b> and <b>he taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>marriage contracts due to</b> teaching the <i>halakha</i> of <b>betrothal; there</b> it <b>was necessary for</b> the <i>tanna</i> to mention this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>marriage contracts,</b> and <b>he taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>betrothal due to</b> teaching the <i>halakha</i> of <b>marriage contracts.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who betroths two women</b> together <b>with</b> an item <b>worth one <i>peruta</i>,</b> so that the value of each woman’s share was not worth one <i>peruta</i>, <b>or</b> who betroths <b>one woman with</b> an item <b>worth less than one <i>peruta</i>, despite</b> the fact <b>that he later sent</b> the traditional <b>gifts [<i>sivlonot</i>]</b> of a groom to the bride,

Daf 50b

<b>she is not betrothed, because he sent</b> the gifts <b>on account of the first betrothal,</b> i.e., the item whose value to the woman was less than one <i>peruta</i>, and not to effect betrothal. <b>And similarly,</b> if there was <b>a minor who betrothed</b> a woman, and he sent her gifts after he became an adult, the assumption is that he sent them on account of his betrothal when he was still a minor, and since betrothal performed by a minor is of no account, she is not betrothed.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for all these cases to be stated in the mishna, despite their apparent similarity. <b>As, had</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught us</b> only the case of one who betroths two women with an item <b>worth one <i>peruta</i>,</b> we would have said: <b>Since</b> enough <b>of his money</b> for betrothal <b>goes out,</b> i.e., is spent, <b>he errs</b> and thinks that he can betroth two women with one <i>peruta</i>, and the gifts he later sends are not for the sake of betrothal. <b>But</b> if he betrothed a woman with an item <b>worth less than one <i>peruta</i>,</b> you might <b>say: He knows that betrothal does not take effect with</b> an item <b>worth less than one <i>peruta</i>, and when he</b> later <b>sends gifts he sends</b> them <b>with the intention of betrothal,</b> and she should consequently become betrothed with them. The mishna therefore teaches us that she is not betrothed even in that case.
<b>And had he taught us</b> only <b>these two</b> cases, we would have said that they were necessary <b>because</b> the difference in <i>halakha</i> <b>between</b> betrothal performed with an item worth <b>one <i>peruta</i> and</b> betrothal performed with an item <b>worth less than one <i>peruta</i> is not established</b> or clear <b>to people,</b> and as he might have thought in those cases that his initial betrothal was valid despite each woman receiving less than one <i>peruta</i>, the gifts he sent later were not sent for the sake of betrothal. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a minor who betroths</b> a woman, <b>everyone knows that the betrothal of a minor is nothing,</b> and you might <b>say</b> that <b>when he</b> later <b>sends gifts, he sends</b> them <b>for the sake of betrothal,</b> and she is betrothed. The mishna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the same <i>halakha</i> applies in this case as well.
It <b>was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> discussed the following matter. <b>Rav Huna says: One</b> must be <b>concerned about gifts.</b> If a woman agreed to a betrothal and the prospective husband sent her gifts in the presence of witnesses, one must be concerned about the possibility that he sent them for the sake of betrothal. Therefore, the woman may not become betrothed to another man without first receiving a bill of divorce from this one. <b>And Rabba similarly says</b> that <b>one</b> must be <b>concerned about gifts. Rabba says: And we raised an objection against</b> this <b><i>halakha</i> of ours,</b> as the mishna teaches: <b>Even if he sent gifts later, she is not betrothed. Abaye said to him: There,</b> in the mishna, the <b>reason</b> is <b>as it teaches: Because he sent</b> the gifts <b>on account of the first betrothal.</b> Therefore, there is no concern that he might have sent them for the sake of betrothal. But in this case, where he had not betrothed her beforehand, he might have intended to betroth her by sending her gifts.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of this discussion. <b>Rabba says: From where do I say</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that one must be concerned about gifts? I have learned it from <b>the reason</b> she is not betrothed, <b>as</b> the mishna <b>teaches: Because he sent</b> the gifts <b>on account of the first betrothal.</b> This indicates that <b>it is here</b> that there is no concern for that he betrothed her, <b>since he erred</b> and thinks she is already betrothed to him by the first act of betrothal, and that there is no need to betroth her again. <b>But generally,</b> where this type of mistake is not possible, the sending of gifts <b>does</b> effect <b>betrothal.</b>
<b>And Abaye</b> rejects this proof, as perhaps the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary.</b> The mishna stated, for stylistic reasons, a <i>halakha</i> that it did not need to state, and it should be understood as follows: <b>It is not necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> <b>in general,</b> in a case that does not involve a prior act of betrothal, <b>when he had not entered the laws,</b> i.e., begun the process, <b>of betrothal at all,</b> and it would never have entered his mind that the gifts should be considered to be for betrothal. <b>Rather, even here</b> in the case of the mishna, <b>when he has</b> already <b>entered the laws of betrothal</b> by attempting to betroth this woman with less than one <i>peruta</i>, one might <b>say</b> that the gifts <b>should be</b> considered given for the sake of <b>betrothal.</b> The <i>tanna</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that there is no concern for betrothal even in that case. It is thereby possible to object to this inference of Rabba.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about it;</b> must one be concerned that the gifts might have been given for the sake of betrothal or not? The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Pappa says: In a place where</b> the custom is that men first <b>betroth</b> women <b>and afterward send gifts we are concerned</b> that he might already have betrothed her or is sending the gifts for the sake of betrothal, since that is the only situation in which gifts are typically sent. But in a place where men first <b>send gifts and afterward betroth</b> women <b>we are not concerned</b> that the gifts are for betrothal.
The Gemara questions this: In a place where <b>they betroth</b> women <b>and afterward send gifts,</b> it <b>is obvious</b> that if a man sends a woman gifts he must already have betrothed her. The Gemara clarifies: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> due to a place <b>where most</b> men <b>betroth</b> women <b>and afterward send gifts, and a minority</b> of men <b>send gifts and afterward betroth</b> women. <b>Lest you say we should be concerned about the minority</b> and say she is not betrothed, Rav Pappa therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the behavior of the minority is not taken into account.
The Gemara discusses a related topic: <b>Rav Aḥa bar Rav Huna inquired of Rava:</b> If a woman’s <b>marriage contract was established,</b> i.e., seen, by people <b>in the marketplace, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>; is she assumed to be married? Rava <b>said to him: And should we establish her as a married woman because a marriage contract was established in the marketplace?</b> Since a marriage contract can be written by a man even before betrothal and without the woman’s consent, its existence does not prove that she is married. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about it?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Ashi says: In a place where</b> men first <b>betroth</b> women <b>and afterward write a marriage contract, we are concerned</b> that he had betrothed her; but in a place where <b>they write</b> the marriage contract first <b>and afterward betroth</b> women, <b>we are not concerned.</b>
The Gemara questions this: In a place where men first <b>betroth</b> women <b>and afterward write</b> the marriage contract it <b>is obvious</b> that there should be a concern that he has betrothed her. The Gemara clarifies: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> due to a place <b>where a scribe is not commonly available. Lest you say</b> that he wrote the marriage contract early because there was <b>a scribe who happened</b> to be there, and the prospective husband took the opportunity to avail himself of the scribe’s services while intending to perform the betrothal later, Rav Ashi therefore <b>teaches us</b> that there is no concern that he might have done so since the custom is to first betroth the woman.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who betroths a woman and her daughter or a woman and her sister in one</b> act of betrothal, by saying: You are both betrothed to me, <b>neither</b> of them <b>is betrothed. And an incident</b> occurred <b>involving five women, and among them</b> were <b>two sisters, and one person gathered a basket of figs that were from their</b> field, <b>and</b> the fruit <b>was of</b> the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>and he said: You are hereby all betrothed to me with this basket, and one of them accepted</b> it <b>on behalf of all of them. And the Sages said: The sisters are not betrothed.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the <i>halakha</i> that betrothal does not take effect if one betroths these two women simultaneously, the Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rami bar Ḥama said:</b> It is <b>as the verse states: “And you shall not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival to her”</b> (Leviticus 18:18). <b>The Torah states: When</b> he betroths them together so <b>that they</b> would <b>become rival wives to one another, he will not be able to take,</b> i.e., betroth, <b>even one of them. Rava said to him: If so,</b> how would you explain <b>this, that it is written</b> at the end of the passage: “Whoever shall do any of these abominations, <b>even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people”</b> (Leviticus 18:29); <b>if betrothal does not take effect with her,</b> what <b>renders</b> him <b>liable to receive excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>]?</b> If he is not betrothed to either woman, and he engages in intercourse with either one, he is not liable for <i>karet</i>, as this punishment is incurred for this sin only if he engaged in intercourse with the sister of his wife.
<b>Rather, Rava says: The verse</b> is discussing a case where he betrothed them <b>consecutively.</b> He first betrothed one sister and then engaged in intercourse with the other, which accounts for the punishment of <i>karet</i>. <b>And the mishna</b> is to be explained <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabba, as Rabba says: Any</b> matters <b>that cannot</b> be accomplished <b>sequentially cannot be</b> accomplished <b>even</b> if one performs them <b>simultaneously.</b> Here too, since he is unable to betroth the mother and daughter or the two sisters sequentially, his betrothal of both of them simultaneously does not take effect.
The Gemara analyzes <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rabba says: Any</b> matters <b>that cannot</b> be accomplished <b>sequentially cannot be</b> accomplished <b>even</b> if one performs them <b>simultaneously. Abaye raised an objection to his</b> opinion from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Demai</i> 8:10):

Daf 51a

In the case of <b>one who increases tithes,</b> i.e., he tithes two-tenths instead of one-tenth of his produce, the remainder of <b>his produce is rendered fit</b> for consumption, as he tithed it properly, <b>but the tithes are ruined,</b> as the additional tithe is neither a tithe nor tithed produce. Since it is unclear which of the two-tenths is the actual tithe and which is not, the entire two-tenths may be treated neither as a tithe nor as tithed produce. <b>But</b> according to Rabba’s opinion, <b>why</b> is this produce rendered fit for consumption? <b>Let us say</b> that <b>any</b> matters <b>that cannot</b> be accomplished <b>sequentially cannot be</b> accomplished <b>even</b> if one performs them <b>simultaneously.</b> Since one cannot designate a tithe of two-tenths sequentially, one-tenth followed by a second tenth, he should be precluded from simultaneously designating two-tenths of his produce as a tithe. Accordingly, it should be considered as though he had not designated any tithe at all, and his produce should not be regarded as tithed.
Rabba <b>said to him:</b> The case of <b>tithe is different, as</b> tithe status <b>takes effect partially,</b> i.e., on less than a unit of produce. <b>As, if one said: Let half</b> of each grain <b>of wheat be designated</b> as tithe, he has <b>designated it.</b> Just as one can designate an entire grain of wheat as a tithe, he can likewise designate a half a grain. In this case too, when one tithes two-tenths of the produce, the ruling is not that one-tenth is the actual tithe and the other tenth is untithed produce. Instead, half of each grain of the designated portion is tithe, while the other half of each grain is not. Accordingly, the remainder of the produce is tithed, as one-tenth of the total has been designated as first tithe. The portion designated as the tithe is ruined, because it is impossible to identify which part of each grain is designated.
The Gemara raises another objection to Rabba’s opinion: <b>But isn’t there</b> the case of <b>animal tithe, which does not take effect partially,</b> as one cannot consecrate half an animal for his tithe. <b>And</b> likewise there is <b>no</b> possibility to separate animals <b>sequentially,</b> as once one has designated one animal as animal tithe he cannot designate another animal for the same purpose. <b>And Rava says:</b> If <b>two</b> animals <b>emerged</b> from the enclosure together <b>as the tenth, and he called them</b> both the <b>tenth,</b> the <b>tenth and eleventh</b> animals <b>are intermingled with each other.</b> One is consecrated with the sanctity of animal tithe while the other remains a peace-offering, but there is no way to determine which is which. The question arises: If the principle that any matters that cannot be accomplished sequentially cannot be accomplished even if one performs them simultaneously is correct, neither animal is consecrated, as one cannot designate both the tenth and the eleventh animals as animal tithe, one after the other.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Animal tithe is different, as</b> two animals <b>can be</b> designated as animal tithe one after the other <b>in</b> the case of <b>an error.</b> Although one cannot designate the tenth and eleventh animals as the animal tithe <i>ab initio</i>, if he did so in error they are both consecrated. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 60a): If one erred and <b>called the ninth</b> animal the <b>tenth,</b> and erred again <b>and</b> called <b>the tenth</b> animal the <b>ninth and the eleventh</b> animal the <b>tenth,</b> all <b>three</b> animals <b>are consecrated.</b> The first is consecrated because it was designated as the tenth, the second because it actually is the tenth, and the third because it was designated as the tenth. Apparently, more than one animal can be consecrated as the animal tithe, if designated in error. In Rava’s example as well, a modicum of sanctity applies to the two animals that emerged together and were together designated as the tenth.
The Gemara raises another objection to Rabba’s principle. <b>There is</b> the case of the forty loaves that accompany <b>a thanks-offering, which are not</b> consecrated if they were designated <b>in error, and are also not</b> consecrated if two sets of loaves were designated for the same offering <b>sequentially. And</b> yet <b>it was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to <b>a thanks-offering that was slaughtered</b> accompanied <b>by eighty loaves,</b> twice the required amount. <b>Ḥizkiyya said: Forty of the eighty</b> loaves <b>are consecrated,</b> even though their identity cannot be determined. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Not</b> even <b>forty of the eighty</b> loaves <b>are consecrated.</b> It would appear that these <i>amora’im</i> disagree with regard to whether or not sanctity that cannot take effect in sequence can take effect simultaneously.
The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>Wasn’t it stated with regard to this</b> dispute that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: All,</b> both Ḥizkiyya and Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>concede</b> that <b>anywhere that</b> the one bringing the thanks-offering <b>said:</b> Let <b>forty of the eighty</b> loaves <b>be consecrated,</b> the forty <b>are consecrated;</b> and in a case where he said: <b>Forty</b> loaves <b>should not be consecrated unless</b> all <b>eighty are consecrated,</b> everyone agrees that <b>they are not consecrated.</b>
<b>They disagree only with regard to</b> a case where the one bringing the thanks-offering designates eighty loaves <b>without specification</b> of how many loaves he wants consecrated. One <b>Sage,</b> Ḥizkiyya, <b>holds:</b> Although he designated eighty loaves, he wants to consecrate only forty, and when he sets aside eighty loaves, <b>he</b> merely <b>intends to ensure</b> that he will have forty. He therefore brought the extra loaves so that if the first forty loaves are lost or become ritually impure the second forty will be consecrated in their place. Consequently, the first forty loaves are consecrated. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds:</b> He <b>intends</b> to bring <b>a large offering</b> of eighty loaves, and therefore none of the loaves are consecrated. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi’s explanation of the dispute accords with Rabba’s opinion.
The Gemara turns from its analysis of Rabba’s opinion to the original issue: <b>And why does Rava explain</b> the mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba? Let him derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with a principle of his own, as elsewhere (9a) he establishes that <b>betrothal that is not given to consummation</b> is not betrothal at all, and all of <b>these</b> cases <b>are</b> in this category. Any betrothal in which it is prohibited for the couple to engage in sexual intercourse is not considered betrothal at all. Following this principle, the ruling of the mishna can be explained as follows: Since both women would be forbidden to the man in the event that they were both betrothed to him, as each would be the relative of his betrothed, the betrothals are not given to consummation. Therefore, they do not take effect at all.
The Gemara answers: Rava could have explained the mishna this way, but <b>he stated</b> his explanation <b>in accordance with the statement of Rami bar Ḥama.</b> Rava should be understood as saying: Your opinion that the ruling of the mishna is derived from a verse is incorrect, as the verse is referring only to one who betroths the two sisters or the mother and daughter sequentially. Instead, you should explain the mishna as referring to one who betroths them at the same time, with the reason being that any matters that cannot be accomplished sequentially cannot be accomplished even if one performs them simultaneously.
§ <b>It was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> had a dispute: With regard to <b>betrothal that is not given to consummation, Abaye says it is betrothal,</b> since the prohibition against engaging in sexual intercourse does not affect the betrothal itself. <b>Rava says: It is not betrothal. Rava says:</b> The Sage <b>bar Ahina explained to me</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived from the verse: <b>“When a man takes a woman and engages in sexual intercourse with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), as it indicates that <b>betrothal that is given to</b> permitted <b>consummation is betrothal,</b> whereas <b>betrothal that is not given to consummation is not betrothal.</b>
The Gemara proceeds to analyze these two opinions. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: In the case of <b>one who betroths a woman and her daughter or a woman and her sister in one</b> act of betrothal <b>neither</b> of them <b>is betrothed.</b> The Gemara analyzes this: <b>But</b> if he said he is betrothing only <b>one of</b> this pair, i.e., <b>the woman or her daughter, or</b> one <b>of</b> that pair, i.e., <b>the woman or her sister,</b> without specifying which of them, <b>she is betrothed.</b> Nevertheless, in practice it is prohibited for him to engage in intercourse with either of them, as it cannot be determined which woman he betrothed and which woman is the relative of his betrothed. <b>But why</b> should the betrothal take effect? <b>These are</b> each <b>a betrothal that is not given to consummation,</b> and should not be valid according to Rava. Shall we say this is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> to the opinion <b>of Rava?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Rava</b> could have <b>said to you</b> in response: <b>And according to your reasoning</b> that a betrothal that is not given to consummation is still betrothal, <b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>An incident</b> occurred <b>involving five women, and among them</b> were <b>two sisters. And one</b> man <b>gathered a basket of figs that were from their</b> field, <b>and</b> the fruit <b>was of the Sabbatical</b> Year. <b>And he said: You are hereby all betrothed to me with this basket,</b> and one of them accepted it on behalf of all of them. <b>And the Sages said: The sisters are not betrothed.</b> This indicates that <b>it is the sisters who are not betrothed, but the unrelated women,</b> the other three women who are not related to each other, <b>are betrothed.</b>
The Gemara continues to explain what Rava could have said. <b>What are the circumstances? If we say that he said: You are all</b> betrothed to me, this <b>is</b> comparable to one who gives something to another and says: <b>Let you and the donkey acquire</b> this item. <b>And</b> in a situation where someone would say: Let <b>you and the donkey</b> acquire it, the recipient has <b>not acquired</b> the item. Since the donkey cannot acquire items the person does not acquire it either, because the owner linked the two acquisitions. Here too, since he tried to give the item of the betrothal to all of the women, some of whom, the sisters, he cannot betroth together, the betrothal should not take effect even with the other women despite the fact that they are suitable for him.

Daf 51b

<b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where he said to them: One of you</b> is betrothed, <b>and it teaches</b> that <b>the sisters are not betrothed,</b> because with regard to the sisters the betrothal is not given to consummation? The Gemara comments: If so, the <b>first clause</b> of the mishna <b>is difficult for Rava,</b> while the <b>last clause is difficult for Abaye.</b> The Gemara presents a resolution: <b>Abaye explains</b> the last clause according <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning,</b> and <b>Rava explains</b> the first clause according <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning.</b>
<b>Abaye explains</b> it according <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning,</b> as follows: In the case of <b>one who betroths a woman and her daughter or a woman and her sister in one</b> act of betrothal <b>neither</b> of them <b>is betrothed. But</b> if he betrothed <b>one of</b> a pair consisting of <b>a woman and her daughter</b> or <b>a woman and her sister</b> by saying: One of you is betrothed to me, each of them is <b>betrothed</b> as a matter of uncertainty and requires a bill of divorce, despite the fact that the betrothal is not given to consummation, in case he is in fact betrothed to the other one.
The Gemara continues Abaye’s explanation: <b>And if he</b> explicitly <b>said: The one</b> of you <b>fit for sexual intercourse shall be betrothed to me, neither</b> of them <b>is betrothed,</b> as he cannot engage in intercourse with either, not knowing which of them is his betrothed and which is his betrothed’s relative. <b>And an incident also</b> occurred <b>involving five women, and among them</b> were <b>two sisters. And one</b> man <b>gathered a basket of figs and said: The one</b> among you <b>fit</b> for intercourse <b>with me shall be betrothed to me</b> with this basket, <b>and the Sages said: The sisters are not betrothed.</b>
<b>And Rava explains</b> according <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning:</b> In the case of <b>one who betroths one of</b> a pair consisting of <b>a woman and her daughter or one of</b> a pair consisting of <b>a woman and her sister it becomes as one who simultaneously betrothed a woman and her daughter or a woman and her sister, and they are not betrothed,</b> since betrothal that is not given to consummation is not considered betrothal. <b>And an incident also</b> occurred <b>involving five women, and among them</b> were <b>two sisters. And one</b> man <b>gathered a basket of figs and said: All of you, and one of</b> the <b>two sisters, are hereby betrothed to me with this basket. And the Sages said: The sisters are not betrothed.</b> Since the mishna can be read in either of these two ways, nothing can be proven from it with regard to the issue of betrothal that is not given to consummation.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (64b): In the case of <b>one who betroths his daughter</b> to a man <b>without specification,</b> i.e., without specifying which daughter he meant, <b>the grown women are not included</b> among those who might be betrothed, since he does not have the right to betroth them. The Gemara analyzes this: One can infer that the <b>minor daughters are included,</b> and each is betrothed as a matter of uncertainty. <b>But why</b> are the minor daughters betrothed? Each of <b>these</b> betrothals is a <b>betrothal that is not given to consummation,</b> since he did not specify which of his minor daughters he had in mind. Therefore, according to Rava betrothal should not take effect with regard to any of them, <b>and</b> this is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rava.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Rava</b> could have <b>said to you: With what are we dealing here?</b> It is <b>when there is only</b> one <b>adult</b> daughter <b>and</b> one <b>minor</b> daughter. Consequently, once the adult daughter is removed from consideration, it is clear that the father has betrothed the minor daughter, and the betrothal is given to consummation.
The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>But</b> that mishna <b>teaches: Grown women,</b> in the plural. The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>grown women? Grown women in general.</b> In other words, whenever people betroth their daughters without further specification, only the minor daughters, and not the adult daughters, are included. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that there are only two daughters, <b>what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this; what novel <i>halakha</i> does it teach?
The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> It is a situation <b>where</b> his adult daughter <b>designated him</b> as her <b>agent</b> to betroth her. <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>when</b> he <b>accepts betrothal</b> from someone on behalf of his daughter without further specification he <b>accepts it with her in mind,</b> and he intended to betroth her rather than his minor daughter, the mishna therefore <b>teaches us that a person does not set aside something from which he has benefit,</b> e.g., the betrothal of his minor daughter, where he keeps the betrothal money, in favor of something from which he has no benefit, e.g., the betrothal of his adult daughter, where she keeps the betrothal money.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Aren’t we</b> also <b>dealing</b> with a case <b>where</b> the adult daughter <b>said to him:</b> When you betroth me, <b>my betrothal</b> money <b>is for you?</b> Accordingly, he derives benefit from her betrothal as well. The Gemara explains: <b>Even so,</b> the father would not have intended to betroth his adult daughter, since <b>a person does not set aside a mitzva that is incumbent upon him,</b> e.g., the betrothal of his minor daughter, <b>and perform a mitzva that is not incumbent upon him,</b> e.g., the betrothal of his adult daughter.
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (64b): With regard to <b>one who has two groups of daughters from two women,</b> e.g., he has multiple daughters from his first wife, and after his first wife died he remarried and had multiple daughters with his second wife, <b>and he said: I betrothed my elder daughter</b> to someone, <b>but I do not know if</b> it was the <b>eldest of the older</b> group of daughters <b>or if</b> it was <b>the eldest of the younger</b> group of daughters, or <b>if</b> it was the <b>youngest of the older</b> group, <b>who is</b> nevertheless <b>older than the eldest of the younger</b> group; <b>all</b> the daughters <b>are prohibited</b> from marrying someone else without first receiving a bill of divorce, <b>except for the youngest of the younger</b> group, who is certainly not betrothed. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> This betrothal is not given to consummation, since each daughter could be the sister of his actual betrothed, and yet the betrothal is considered valid, as otherwise they would all be permitted to marry without requiring a bill of divorce.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> It is a situation <b>where they were identified and later intermingled.</b> In other words, this mishna is not dealing with one who betrothed a daughter without specifying which one; rather, he initially stated which daughter he intended to betroth but subsequently forgot. The actual betrothal is given to consummation, so the daughters are betrothed due to the uncertainty. The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as it teaches</b> that he said: <b>I do not know,</b> in the first person and in the present tense, indicating that he did know who it was at one point but does not know now, <b>and it does not teach</b> that he said: <b>It is not known.</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>Learn from</b> the language of the mishna that we are indeed dealing with a case where the daughters were intermingled after they were identified.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this; what novel <i>halakha</i> does it teach? The Gemara answers: The mishna serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei, who says: A person does not place himself</b> into a situation <b>of uncertainty,</b> and when he said elder daughter he must have meant the eldest of the older group, who is the absolute eldest. Rabbi Meir <b>teaches us that a person does place himself</b> into a situation <b>of uncertainty,</b> and the uncertainty applies to each of his daughters, except for the youngest of the younger group.
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (<i>Yevamot</i> 23b): In the case of <b>one who betrothed one of two sisters and he does not know which</b> one <b>he betrothed,</b> he must <b>give a bill of divorce to this</b> one <b>and a bill of divorce to that</b> one, due to the uncertainty. This betrothal is not given to consummation, so why do they require bills of divorce? The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> It is <b>when they were identified and later intermingled.</b> The actual betrothal was given to consummation, so the sisters are betrothed due to the uncertainty. The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as it teaches</b> the phrase: <b>He does not know,</b> indicating that he did know who it was at one point but now does not know, <b>and it does not teach</b> the phrase: <b>It is not known.</b>
The Gemara poses a question: <b>If so, what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this; what novel <i>halakha</i> does it teach? The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to teach <b>the latter clause</b> of that mishna: If this man <b>died and he had one brother,</b> the brother <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with both of</b> the sisters, but he cannot perform levirate marriage with either because one of them is the sister of his <i>yevama</i>, who is forbidden to him by rabbinic law. If <b>he had two</b> brothers, <b>one</b> of them <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i></b> with one of the sisters but may not take her in levirate marriage, due to the possibility that she is the sister of a woman with whom he has a levirate bond. <b>And</b> then <b>one takes</b> the other <b>in levirate marriage</b> if he so desires. If both brothers <b>married</b> the sisters <b>before</b> consulting the court, the court does <b>not remove them from</b> their marriage and they are permitted to remain married. Although the first couple should have performed <i>ḥalitza</i>, the court does not force them to divorce.
The Gemara explains the novelty of the latter clause: This is effective <b>specifically</b> if one brother first <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i> and afterward</b> the second brother <b>performs levirate marriage, but</b> if one brother first <b>performs levirate marriage and afterward</b> the other brother <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> the levirate marriage would <b>not</b> take effect, <b>as he</b> is possibly <b>encountering the sister of</b> the woman <b>bound to him</b> by ties of levirate marriage. Until the <i>yevama</i> is released through <i>ḥalitza</i>, her sister is considered, to a certain extent, the sister of his wife, due to the ties of levirate marriage. The one who performs levirate marriage might have chosen the sister of the woman betrothed by the dead brother.
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the continuation of that mishna: In the case of <b>two</b> unrelated men <b>who betrothed two sisters,</b> where <b>this</b> one <b>does not know which</b> sister <b>he betrothed and that</b> one <b>does not know which</b> sister <b>he betrothed, this</b> one <b>gives two bills of divorce,</b> one to each of the women, <b>and that</b> one <b>gives two bills of divorce.</b> Their betrothal is not given to consummation, so according to Rava why do they require a bill of divorce? The Gemara answers: <b>Here too,</b> it is discussing a case <b>where they were identified and later intermingled.</b> The actual betrothal was given to consummation, so the sisters are betrothed due to the uncertainty. The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as it teaches</b> using the phrase: <b>Does not know,</b> indicating that at one point he did know who it was but now does not know, <b>and it does not teach: It is not known.</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>Learn from it</b> that we are indeed dealing with a case where the sisters were identified and later intermingled.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this; what novel <i>halakha</i> does it teach? The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to teach <b>the latter clause</b> of that mishna: If each man <b>died</b> before he divorced, <b>and this</b> one <b>had a brother and that</b> one <b>had a brother,</b> then <b>this</b> brother <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with both of them, and that</b> brother <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with both of them.</b> Neither man may perform levirate marriage, lest he perform levirate marriage with the sister of his <i>yevama</i>. If <b>this</b> one <b>had one</b> brother <b>and that</b> one <b>had two</b> brothers,

Daf 52a

<b>the one</b> brother <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with both of them, and</b> of <b>the two</b> brothers, <b>one performs <i>ḥalitza</i></b> with one of the sisters <b>and one,</b> if he so desires, <b>performs levirate marriage</b> with the other sister. <b>If they married</b> the widows <b>before</b> consulting the court, the court <b>does not remove them from</b> the marriage, and they are permitted to remain married.
The Gemara explains the novelty of the latter clause: This is effective <b>specifically</b> if one of the two brothers first <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i> and afterward</b> the other brother <b>performs levirate marriage, but</b> if one of the two brothers first <b>performs levirate marriage and afterward</b> the other brother <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> the levirate marriage would <b>not</b> take effect, <b>as he</b> is possibly <b>encountering a <i>yevama</i></b> getting married <b>to</b> a member of the <b>public.</b> This is because it is possible that the woman he married was not his <i>yevama</i> but someone else’s <i>yevama</i>, and until the other man’s brother performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with her it is still prohibited for her to marry other men.
The Gemara derives a proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as</b> the Sage <b>Tavyumei taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: If <b>this</b> man <b>had five sons and that</b> man <b>had five daughters, and</b> the first man <b>said: One of your daughters is betrothed to one of my sons, each and every one</b> of the daughters <b>requires five bills of divorce,</b> one from each of the sons, due to the uncertainty of who is betrothed to whom. If <b>one of the</b> sons <b>died</b> before giving his bill of divorce, <b>each and every one</b> of the daughters <b>requires four bills of divorce,</b> one from each of the surviving brothers, <b>and <i>ḥalitza</i> from one of them,</b> in case she was betrothed to the deceased son. The <i>ḥalitza</i> of one of the brothers suffices to release her from her levirate bond. According to Rava this betrothal should not be valid, as it is not given to consummation. Why, then, do they each require bills of divorce?
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>here too</b> it is referring to a case <b>where they were identified and later intermingled,</b> that cannot be. This is as the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: One of your daughters to one of my sons,</b> indicating that the betrothal could never have been given to consummation, and yet it is a valid betrothal. The Gemara concludes: <b>The refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rava is a conclusive refutation.</b> The Gemara further notes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Abaye</b> when he has a dispute with Rava <b>with regard to</b> six <i>halakhot</i>, as represented by the mnemonic <b><i>yod</i>, <i>ayin</i>, <i>lamed</i>, <i>kuf</i>, <i>gimmel</i>, <i>mem</i>:</b> Despair that is not conscious [<i>yeush shelo mida’at</i>], conspiring witnesses [<i>eidim</i>] who are disqualified retroactively, a side post [<i>leḥi</i>] standing alone, betrothal [<i>kiddushin</i>] that is not given to consummation, revealing intent with a bill of divorce [<i>get</i>], and an apostate [<i>mumar</i>] who sins rebelliously. Although the <i>halakha</i> generally is in accordance with the opinion of Rava in his disputes with Abaye, in these six cases the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Abaye.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>An incident</b> occurred <b>involving five women,</b> and among them were two sisters. And one person gathered a basket of figs that were from their field, and the fruit was of the Sabbatical Year. And he said: You are hereby all betrothed to me with this basket, and one of them accepted it on behalf of all of them. And the Sages said: The sisters are not betrothed. <b>Rav says:</b> One can <b>learn four</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>from the mishna.</b> The Gemara adds: <b>And Rav held three</b> of them <b>in his hand,</b> i.e., knew what they were, but he was uncertain about the fourth.
Rav clarifies: <b>Learn from it</b> that with regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with produce of</b> the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>she is betrothed,</b> and you do not say that this produce can be used only for eating and not for any other purpose. <b>And learn from it</b> that if one <b>betroths</b> a woman <b>with a stolen item, even</b> if it was <b>her stolen item, she is not betrothed.</b> You do not say that her accepting from him an item that he stole from her indicates that she released him from his obligation to return it, rendering it his to use in order to betroth her. <b>From where</b> can these two <i>halakhot</i> be deduced? It is <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it teaches</b> that the produce <b>was from their</b> field, <b>and was of</b> the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, which indicates: <b>The reason</b> it could be used for betrothal is that the produce was <b>of</b> the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>which</b> causes the figs to be <b>ownerless</b> property. <b>But</b> if it was one <b>of the other years of the seven-</b>year Sabbatical cycle, the betrothal would <b>not</b> take effect with stolen property, even if she accepted it for her betrothal.
<b>And learn from it: A woman can become an agent</b> to accept a betrothal <b>for another</b> woman, <b>and</b> this is so <b>even in a situation where she</b> thereby <b>becomes</b> the <b>rival wife of</b> the other, as in the case of the mishna.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the other</b> <i>halakha</i>, the fourth one mentioned by Rav? It is the <i>halakha</i> of <b>betrothal that is not given to consummation.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>And let</b> Rav also <b>count this</b> <i>halakha</i>. The Gemara explains: He does not do so, <b>because he is uncertain whether</b> the correct interpretation of the mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Abaye,</b> who maintains that such a betrothal is valid, or <b>whether</b> the correct interpretation of the mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rava,</b> which would mean it is not betrothal.
The Gemara relates: <b>When Rabbi Zeira ascended</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>he stated this <i>halakha</i> before Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who <b>said to him: Did Rav</b> actually <b>say so?</b> This indicates that Rabbi Yoḥanan disagreed with the statement of Rav that these <i>halakhot</i> can be learned from the mishna, which leads the Gemara to ask: <b>But didn’t he</b> himself <b>say</b> so? <b>And didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say:</b> If one <b>robbed</b> another of an item <b>and</b> its <b>owner has not despaired</b> of recovering it, <b>neither of them can consecrate</b> the stolen item? <b>This</b> one, the robber, cannot consecrate it <b>because it is not his, and that</b> one, the owner, cannot consecrate it <b>because it is not in his possession.</b> By the same logic, one should not be able to betroth a woman with stolen property, as it is not his. The Gemara answers that Rabbi Yoḥanan was not objecting to Rav’s opinion, but <b>this is</b> what <b>he said to him: Did Rav</b> actually <b>say in accordance with my</b> opinion?
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against Rav’s opinion that one cannot betroth a woman with stolen property, from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 4:5): If one <b>betrothed her with</b> an item taken <b>in robbery, in a forced transaction, or in theft, or if he grabbed a <i>sela</i> from her hand and betrothed her</b> with it, <b>she is betrothed.</b> This indicates that one can betroth a woman with stolen property. The Gemara answers: <b>There</b> it is referring to <b>her stolen</b> property, and by accepting it from him as betrothal, she indicates that she has released him from his obligation to return it.
The Gemara asks: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that the last clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: Or if he grabbed a <i>sela</i> of hers, it may be inferred that</b> in <b>the first clause we are dealing with</b> property <b>stolen from others.</b> The Gemara explains: These are not two separate cases. Instead, the <i>tanna</i> <b>is explaining</b> his earlier statement: If one <b>betrothed</b> a woman <b>with</b> an item taken <b>in robbery, in a forced transaction, or in theft; how so? For example, if he grabbed a <i>sela</i> from her hand and betrothed her with it.</b>

Daf 52b

The Gemara questions this analysis: <b>But</b> doesn’t <b>the mishna</b> deal <b>with</b> a case where the <b>stolen item</b> is <b>hers, and</b> yet <b>Rav says she is not betrothed.</b> The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult; this</b> case, in the <i>baraita</i>, is referring to a situation <b>where he had arranged</b> to betroth her beforehand, which indicates that she has released him from his obligation to return it, but <b>that</b> case, in the mishna, is referring to a situation <b>where he had not arranged</b> his marriage with her, so it is stolen property and she is not betrothed.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain woman who was washing her feet in a vessel of water. A certain man came</b> along, <b>grabbed</b> a few <b>dinars from another</b> person, <b>and threw</b> them <b>to her,</b> and <b>said to her: You are betrothed to me. That man</b> subsequently <b>came before Rava,</b> to inquire as to the status of the woman. Rava <b>said: There is not</b> anyone <b>who is concerned for this</b> opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon, who said:</b> In <b>an ordinary</b> case of <b>robbery</b> the <b>owner has despaired</b> of recovering the stolen item, and it belongs to the robber. Rather, the assumption is that the owner has not despaired of recovering the stolen item. In this case, since the stolen dinars do not belong to the man, his betrothal is of no effect.
The Gemara relates another incident: The was <b>a certain sharecropper who betrothed</b> a woman <b>with a handful [<i>bemoza</i>] of onions [<i>deshamkhei</i>]</b> taken from the field where he worked. <b>He came before Rava</b> to ask about the status of the woman. Rava <b>said to him: Who relinquished</b> these onions <b>to you?</b> Since the owner did not allow you to take them, they are stolen property, and the woman is not betrothed. The Gemara comments: <b>And this matter applies</b> only <b>to a handful, but</b> if he took <b>a bundle</b> of onions and betrothed a woman with them, the sharecropper <b>can say to</b> the owner: <b>I took a bundle, you take a bundle; one bundle for</b> another <b>bundle.</b> Since in any case they divide the crop between them, it is not considered theft.
The Gemara relates another incident: There was <b>a certain brewer [<i>sarseya</i>]</b> who was making date beer for someone, <b>who betrothed</b> a woman <b>with sediment [<i>bifruma</i>] from the beer. The owner of the beer came</b> and <b>found him.</b> The owner <b>said to him: Why don’t you give</b> her the betrothal <b>from this,</b> the <b>sharp</b> sediments that are of better quality than the kind you chose? The brewer <b>came before Rava</b> to ask whether the owner’s comment indicated that he had relinquished his rights to the sediment, which would mean the woman is betrothed. Rava <b>said</b> to him: The Sages <b>said</b> that if the owner discovers that someone has taken something of his without permission and says: <b>Go to</b> and take <b>the</b> item of <b>better</b> quality, that it is a sign he agrees with the man’s action <b>only with regard to <i>teruma</i> alone,</b> and you did not have the right to use the sediment.
The Gemara explains the previous statement: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Terumot</i> 1:5): <b>When did they say</b> that in the case where <b>one separates <i>teruma</i> without</b> the owner’s <b>consent, his <i>teruma</i> is</b> considered <b><i>teruma</i>?</b> The <i>baraita</i> clarifies: In a case where <b>there was</b> someone <b>who entered another’s field and gathered</b> produce from it, <b>and separated <i>teruma</i> without</b> the owner’s <b>permission, if</b> the owner is <b>concerned about</b> his actions and view it <b>as robbery, his <i>teruma</i> is not <i>teruma</i>, but if</b> he is <b>not</b> concerned, <b>his <i>teruma</i> is <i>teruma</i>.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And from where would</b> the gatherer <b>know whether</b> he should be <b>concerned</b> that the owner objects and views it <b>as robbery or not?</b> If <b>the owner came and found him</b> separating <i>teruma</i> <b>and said to him: Go to</b> take <b>the</b> produce of <b>better</b> quality and separate <i>teruma</i> from that, then <b>if</b> produce of <b>better</b> quality <b>than</b> the produce he had separated <b>is found, his <i>teruma</i> is</b> considered <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> since the owner is assumed to have been sincere and pleased that the other has separated <i>teruma</i> from his produce. <b>But if not, his <i>teruma</i> is not <i>teruma</i>,</b> as it may be assumed that the owner was angry at him and was speaking sarcastically. The <i>baraita</i> adds: If <b>the owners were gathering and adding</b> to the <i>teruma</i> he had separated, indicating that they agree to his act of separation, <b>either way,</b> whether or not better-quality produce was found, <b>his <i>teruma</i> is</b> considered <b><i>teruma</i>.</b>
Rava concludes the explanation of his ruling: This <i>halakha</i> applies only to <i>teruma</i>, which is a mitzva that the owner must in any case perform. <b>But here,</b> in the case of the brewer who betrothed a woman with sediment from the beer, the owner <b>acts because of embarrassment,</b> and while he does not feel comfortable protesting, he did not in fact relinquish his rights to the sediment, <b>and she is not betrothed.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to a priest <b>who betroths</b> a woman <b>with his portion</b> of offerings, <b>whether</b> he did so with <b>offerings of the most sacred order</b> or <b>whether</b> he did so with <b>offerings of lesser sanctity, she is not betrothed.</b> One who betroths a woman <b>with second tithe, whether unwittingly</b> or <b>intentionally, has not betrothed</b> her; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If he did so <b>unwittingly he has not betrothed</b> her, but if he did so <b>intentionally he has betrothed</b> her.
<b>And</b> with regard to one who betroths a woman <b>with consecrated</b> property belonging to the Temple treasury, if he does so <b>intentionally he has betrothed</b> her, <b>and</b> if he does so <b>unwittingly he has not betrothed</b> her; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says</b> the opposite: If he does so <b>unwittingly he has betrothed</b> her, but if he does so <b>intentionally he has not betrothed</b> her.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states with regard to the obligation to bring an offering for taking a false oath concerning unlawful possession of the property of another: “If any one sin, <b>and he commits a trespass against the Lord,</b> and deal falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit, or of pledge, or of robbery, or have oppressed his neighbor” (Leviticus 5:21). As the verse is discussing property belonging to another, the phrase “a trespass against the Lord” serves <b>to include</b> in the obligation of an offering a false oath with regard to possession of <b>offerings of lesser sanctity</b> of another person, <b>which are the property</b> of the owner; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b> According to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, the portion of an offering of lesser sanctity that the priest receives belongs to him, so he should be able to betroth a woman with it.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>You</b> can <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, as Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says</b> that an offering of lesser sanctity belongs to its owner only <b>while</b> the animal is still <b>alive, but after</b> its <b>slaughter</b> it does <b>not</b> belong to the priest who receives portions from it. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>When</b> the priests <b>receive</b> their portion after the animal has been slaughtered <b>they receive</b> their portion <b>from the table of the Most High,</b> and do not own the portion itself.
The Gemara adds: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as it teaches:</b> With regard to a priest <b>who betroths</b> a woman <b>with his portion</b> of offerings, <b>whether</b> he did so with <b>offerings of the most sacred order or whether</b> he used <b>offerings of lesser sanctity, has not betrothed</b> her. The mishna does not speak of a priest who betroths a woman with a living offering of lesser sanctity but of one who betroths with the portion of the slaughtered animal he has received. The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from it</b> that it is only in this case that she is not betrothed.
<b>The Sages taught: After the death of Rabbi Meir, Rabbi Yehuda said to his students: Do not let the students of Rabbi Meir enter here</b> into our house of study, <b>because they are vexatious [<i>kanteranim</i>]. And they do not come to study Torah,</b> but <b>rather they come to overwhelm me with <i>halakhot</i>. Sumakhos,</b> a student of Rabbi Meir, <b>pushed and entered</b> anyway. <b>He said to them: This</b> is what <b>Rabbi Meir taught me:</b> With regard to a priest <b>who betroths</b> a woman <b>with his portion</b> of the offerings, <b>whether</b> he did so with <b>offerings of the most sacred order or whether</b> he used <b>offerings of lesser sanctity, he has not betrothed</b> her.
Upon hearing this, <b>Rabbi Yehuda became angry with</b> his students. <b>He said to them: Didn’t I say this to you: Do not let the students of Rabbi Meir enter here</b> into our house of study, <b>because they are vexatious? And they do not come to study Torah,</b> but <b>rather they come to overwhelm me with <i>halakhot</i>.</b> Rabbi Yehuda explained his objection to the statement of Rabbi Meir: This <i>halakha</i> is not relevant, <b>as from where</b> would <b>a woman</b> appear <b>in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard?</b> Women may not enter the area of the Temple courtyard where the priests eat the offerings of the most sacred order, so there is no reason to address an impossible scenario.
<b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who was present, <b>said: They will say: Meir died, Yehuda grew angry,</b> and <b>Yosei remained silent; what will become of the words of Torah?</b> He said: In fact, this <i>halakha</i> is relevant; <b>but isn’t it common</b> for <b>a man to accept betrothal for his daughter in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard?</b> There is no need to give the betrothal item directly to the woman; it can be given to her father. <b>And</b> additionally, <b>isn’t it common</b> for <b>a woman to designate an agent for herself to accept her betrothal in the courtyard? And furthermore: What</b> would be the <i>halakha</i> if the woman <b>pushed and entered?</b> Since it is possible for her to do so, the <i>halakha</i> in such a case must be determined.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the Sages discussed the issue of a priest who betroths a woman with his portion of offerings of the most sacred order: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says she is betrothed,</b> and <b>Rabbi Yosei says she is not betrothed. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Both of them derived</b> their opinions from <b>one verse,</b> which states that the priests have a right to a portion of offerings of the most sacred order, but they explained it in different ways. The verse states: <b>“This shall be yours of the most holy things, reserved from the fire”</b> (Numbers 18:9). <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that the term <b>“yours”</b> indicates that the portion the priest receives is intended for you, i.e., a priest, <b>and for all your needs,</b> including betrothing a woman. <b>And Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that the verse compares the priest’s portion <b>to the fire</b> on the altar: <b>Just as</b> the portion burned on the <b>fire</b> is <b>for</b> the fire’s <b>consumption, so too,</b> the priest’s portion <b>is also for consumption</b> alone, and not for any other purpose.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b>

Daf 53a

<b>They counted</b> the opinions among the Sages, <b>and they concluded:</b> With regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with his portion</b> of the offerings, <b>whether</b> he did so with <b>offerings of the most sacred order or whether</b> he used the <b>offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> he <b>has not betrothed</b> her, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei. <b>And Rav says: It is still a</b> matter of <b>dispute</b> and they did not reach that conclusion. <b>Abaye said: It is reasonable</b> to rule <b>in accordance with</b> the report <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who says that the <i>halakha</i> was decided in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei.
Abaye quotes an extended <i>baraita</i> indicating that even Rabbi Yehuda accepted that the <i>halakha</i> was decided in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> priests <b>may not receive a share</b> of <b>meal-offerings in exchange for</b> portions of animal <b>offerings,</b> i.e., they may not exchange their portion of a meal-offering for the meat of an animal sacrifice of which they did not receive a portion? <b>The verse states: “And every meal-offering that is baked in the oven…shall all the sons of Aaron have”</b> (Leviticus 7:9–10). This verse emphasizes that the sons of Aaron must divide the meal-offering equally among themselves, without exchanging it for a portion of any other offering.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they may not receive a share</b> of <b>meal-offerings in exchange for</b> portions of animal <b>offerings since they do not substitute for them in</b> the case of <b>poverty.</b> Even one who is too poor to afford to bring an animal offering, e.g., in the case of a sin-offering determined on a sliding scale, does not bring a meal-offering in its stead. Since meal-offerings can never be brought in place of animal offerings, there is clearly no connection between them. <b>But</b> perhaps <b>they may receive a share</b> of <b>meal-offerings in exchange for</b> portions of <b>bird</b>-offerings, <b>since they do substitute for them in</b> the case of <b>poverty.</b> If one is so destitute that he cannot afford to bring a bird-offering he brings a meal-offering. Therefore, <b>the</b> same <b>verse states: “And all that is prepared in the deep pan…shall all the sons of Aaron have,”</b> again stressing that all must have an equal share in that meal-offering.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they may not receive a share</b> of <b>meal-offerings in exchange for</b> portions of <b>bird</b>-offerings <b>since these,</b> bird-offerings, <b>are types of</b> offer-ings that involve <b>blood</b> sprinkled on the altar, <b>and those,</b> meal-offerings, <b>are types</b> of offerings made <b>of flour. But</b> perhaps <b>they may receive a share</b> of portions of <b>bird</b>-offerings <b>in exchange for</b> portions of animal <b>offerings, since both</b> categories are <b>types of</b> offerings that involve <b>blood</b> sprinkled on the altar. Therefore, <b>the</b> same <b>verse states: “And on a griddle,”</b> a seemingly superfluous phrase, which teaches that one may not receive a share even of bird-offerings in exchange for portions of animal offerings.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they may not receive a share</b> of <b>bird</b>-offerings <b>in exchange for</b> portions of animal <b>offerings because the actions,</b> i.e., killing, of <b>these</b> birds is <b>by hand,</b> by pinching the neck, <b>and the actions,</b> i.e., killing, of <b>those</b> animals is <b>with a utensil,</b> by slaughtering with a knife. <b>But</b> perhaps <b>they may receive a share</b> of <b>meal-offerings in exchange for</b> portions of other <b>meal-offerings, since the actions with</b> both <b>these and those</b> are <b>by hand.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> next <b>verse states: “And every meal-offering mingled with oil…shall all the sons of Aaron</b> have” (Leviticus 7:10).
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they may not receive a share</b> of a meal-offering prepared on <b>a griddle in exchange for</b> portions of a meal<b>-</b>offering prepared in <b>a deep pan, or</b> portions of a meal-offering prepared in <b>a deep pan in exchange for</b> portions of a meal<b>-</b>offering prepared on <b>a griddle, since the actions</b> with <b>this</b> deep pan result in <b>a soft</b> product, <b>and the actions</b> with <b>that</b> griddle result in <b>a hard</b> product. <b>But</b> perhaps <b>they may receive a share</b> of a meal-offering prepared on <b>a griddle in exchange for</b> the portions of a meal-offering prepared on <b>a griddle, or</b> a share of a meal-offering prepared in <b>a deep pan in exchange for</b> portions of a meal-offering prepared in <b>a deep pan, since the actions</b> with both <b>these and those</b> result in <b>a hard</b> product, in the case of a griddle, or <b>alternatively,</b> with regard to a deep pan, <b>the actions</b> result in <b>a soft</b> product. Therefore, <b>the</b> same <b>verse states: “Or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have”</b> (Leviticus 7:10).
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that they <b>may not receive a share of offerings of the most sacred order,</b> e.g., meal-offerings, in exchange for a portion of another similar offering, <b>but they may receive a share of offerings of lesser sanctity</b> in exchange for a portion of another similar offering. Therefore, <b>the</b> same <b>verse states</b> with regard to meal-offerings: “Shall all the sons of Aaron have, <b>one as well as another”</b> (Leviticus 7:10), <b>and near it</b> appears the verse: <b>“If</b> he offers it <b>for a thanks-offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:12), from which is derived: <b>Just as one may not receive a share</b> of one offering in exchange for a portion of another similar offering in the case <b>of offerings of the most sacred order, so too, one may not receive a share</b> of one offering in exchange for a portion of another similar offering in the case <b>of offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> e.g., a thanks-offering.
The <i>baraita</i> expounds this verse further: It states: <b>“One</b> as well as another [<b><i>ish</i></b> <i>ke’aḥiv</i>],” which teaches that with regard to priests, <b>a man [<i>ish</i>]</b> who is an adult <b>receives a share even</b> if he is <b>blemished, but</b> a priest who is <b>a minor may not receive a share even</b> if he is <b>unblemished.</b> This <i>baraita</i> is found in the <i>Sifra</i>, a collection of halakhic <i>midrashim</i> on the book of Leviticus. And <b>who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> to whom <b>unattributed</b> statements in the <b><i>Sifra</i></b> are assigned? It is <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and</b> here <b>he says that no law of receiving a share</b> applies <b>to it at all,</b> which means that priests cannot exchange one portion of any type of offering for another portion, so they cannot use it to betroth a woman. <b>Conclude from it</b> that Rabbi Yehuda retracted his opinion and subscribes to the opinion that a priest does not own the portion of the offerings he receives.
<b>Rava said: But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Sota</i> 13:7): When the priests receive their portion of the shewbread each week, <b>the modest ones withdraw their hands</b> and do not take it, <b>and the gluttons receive</b> all the <b>shares</b> of the bread. This indicates that offerings may be apportioned according to the priests’ wishes. The Gemara rejects this: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>receive</b> the <b>shares?</b> It does not mean that they exchange one portion for another with halakhic sanction; it means that <b>they</b> would <b>snatch</b> their colleagues’ portions, <b>as it teaches</b> in the <b>latter clause</b> of that same <i>baraita</i>: <b>An incident</b> occurred <b>involving one who snatched his share and his colleague’s share, and they called him ben Ḥamtzan,</b> son of the snatcher, <b>until the day he died.</b>
<b>Rabba bar Rav Sheila said: What is the verse</b> from which is derived that <i>ḥamtzan</i> means one who snatches? The verse states: <b>“My God, rescue me out of the hand of the wicked, out of the grasp of the unrighteous and grasping man [<i>ḥometz</i>]”</b> (Psalms 71:4). <b>Rabba said:</b> It is derived <b>from here: “Learn to do well; seek justice, relieve the oppressed [<i>ḥamotz</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 1:17), i.e., restore property stolen from victims of theft.
§ The mishna teaches: One who betroths a woman with <b>second tithe, whether unwittingly</b> or <b>intentionally, has not betrothed</b> her; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If he did so <b>unwittingly he has not betrothed</b> her, but if he did so <b>intentionally he has betrothed</b> her. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? From where does Rabbi Meir derive that second tithe cannot be used for betrothal? <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, says in the name of tradition:</b> The verse states: <b>“And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord’s; it is holy to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 27:30). This verse indicates that <b>it is for the Lord, but not for betrothing a woman with it.</b>
The Gemara questions this derivation from several instances where similar wording is employed in a different verse, yet one may use those items for betrothal. But <b>there is <i>teruma</i> of the tithe,</b> about <b>which it is written: “So you also shall set apart a gift of the Lord</b> of all your tithes” (Numbers 18:28)? <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (58a): With regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with <i>teruma</i>, she is betrothed.</b> The Gemara answers: <i>Teruma</i> of the tithe is different, <b>as “to the Lord” is not written with regard to it,</b> indicating that it can be used for betrothal.
The Gemara asks: <b>But there is <i>ḥalla</i>,</b> the portion of dough that one must separate and give to a priest, <b>about which it is written:</b> “Of the first of your dough <b>you shall give to the Lord”</b> (Numbers 15:21)? <b>And we</b> also <b>learned</b> in that same mishna: With regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with <i>terumot</i>,</b> of which <i>ḥalla</i> is one type, <b>she is betrothed.</b> The Gemara answers: Although the verse does write “to the Lord,” <i>ḥalla</i> is different, <b>as</b> the word <b>“holy” was not written with regard to it.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But there is</b> produce of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>about which it is written: “It is a Jubilee, it shall be holy to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:12)? <b>And we learned</b> by inferring from a mishna (50b) that in the case of <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with produce of the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>she is betrothed.</b> The Gemara answers: With regard to produce of the Sabbatical Year, the verse writes “holy,” <b>but “to the Lord” is not written with regard to it.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But there is <i>teruma</i>,</b> about <b>which it is written: “The Jewish people are the Lord’s holy portion, His first fruits of the increase”</b> (Jeremiah 2:3)? <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (58a) that in the case of <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with <i>teruma</i>, she is betrothed.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>was written with regard to the Jewish people,</b> who are called the Lord’s holy portion, but not with regard to <i>teruma</i> itself.

Daf 53b

The Gemara asks: <b>But don’t you understand it by itself</b> from this verse? Since the verse compares the Jewish people to <i>teruma</i>, the categorization of “holy” evidently applies to <i>teruma</i> as well. <b>Ravin the Elder interpreted it before Rav:</b> The difference is that with regard to tithe <b>the verse states: “It is</b> for the Lord,” which indicates: <b>As it is, it should be,</b> as consecrated.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> if he betrothed a woman <b>with consecrated</b> property belonging to the Temple treasury, if he does so <b>intentionally he has betrothed</b> her, and if he does so <b>unwittingly he has not betrothed</b> her; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says</b> the opposite: If he did so <b>unwittingly he has betrothed</b> her, but if he does so <b>intentionally he has not betrothed</b> her. <b>Rabbi Ya’akov said: I learned two</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>from Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>an unwitting</b> error involving <b>tithe</b> according to the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> and the <i>halakha</i> of <b>an unwitting</b> error involving <b>consecrated</b> items according to the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir. In both of these</b> cases <b>the woman is not betrothed with</b> the items.
He proceeds to explain. <b>One</b> of these <i>halakhot</i> is <b>because the woman does not want</b> to become betrothed with the item, <b>and</b> the reason for the <b>other</b> is <b>because neither</b> the man nor the woman <b>wants</b> it. He adds: <b>And I do not know which of them</b> is due to the woman alone, and which is due to both parties. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said: Let us see</b> which reason is applicable to which case. It must be that with regard to second <b>tithe,</b> which may be eaten only in Jerusalem, it is <b>not satisfactory for her</b> to be betrothed with it <b>due to the trouble of</b> transporting it all <b>the way</b> to Jerusalem to enjoy it, whereas it is <b>satisfactory for him</b> to betroth her with it, <b>since he acquires a woman by itself,</b> i.e., by the tithe alone, without having to spend additional money of his own. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>consecrated</b> items, it is <b>not satisfactory for the two of them that consecrated</b> property <b>be desacralized by their</b> using it for betrothal.
<b>And Rabbi Ya’akov said the opposite is</b> more <b>reasonable. Couldn’t it be said</b> that in the case of second <b>tithe</b> it is <b>not satisfactory for her</b> to be betrothed with it <b>due to the trouble of</b> transporting it all <b>the way,</b> and it is <b>not satisfactory for him</b> to betroth her with it <b>due to the</b> danger of an <b>accident along the way.</b> If the second tithe gets lost on the way to Jerusalem, she will not have derived any benefit from it. It will cause her distress to think she received nothing for her betrothal, and he does not want cause her distress. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>consecrated</b> items, <b>granted</b> that with regard to <b>her,</b> it is <b>not satisfactory for her that consecrated</b> property <b>be desacralized through her, but why wouldn’t</b> it be <b>satisfactory for him to acquire a woman by itself,</b> without the expenditure of redeeming a consecrated item? Therefore, the reasons for Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement cannot be determined by logic alone.
<b>Rava inquired of Rav Ḥisda:</b> According to Rabbi Meir, <b>a woman cannot be betrothed</b> by receiving consecrated money, but <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the money he gives her for betrothal: Does the <b>money become desacralized</b> as a result of the act of betrothal, as is usually the case when one uses a consecrated item for his own benefit? Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him:</b> If the <b>woman is not betrothed, how can the money become desacralized?</b> Since the money has not actually been used, nothing has changed with regard to its status.
<b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin inquired of Rav Ḥisda: What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to a sale:</b> If one unwittingly uses consecrated money to purchase an item, does the sale take effect? Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: Even with regard to a sale he does not acquire</b> the item.
Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin <b>raised an objection to him:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is that if a man deposited a bundle of money with a money changer, the latter may not use the money. If the money changer untied the bundle and used the money, and it turned out that it was consecrated, the money changer is liable to bring an offering for the misuse of consecrated property, since he acted without the permission of the depositor. If the money was not in a bundle, the money changer has the right to use it, since the depositor knows that a money changer frequently distributes money. Consequently, in this case, if the money was consecrated, it is the depositor who is liable to bring an offering for the misuse of consecrated property, since the money changer is considered to have acted with his awareness. If one deposited the money with a homeowner, i.e., not a money changer, the latter may not use it in either case, and he is liable to bring an offering for the misuse of consecrated property if he does. With regard to a storekeeper, the <i>tanna’im</i> disagree: The same <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>a storekeeper as</b> to <b>a homeowner;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> But <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The same <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>a storekeeper as</b> to <b>a money changer.</b>
The Gemara analyzes this: <b>They disagree only with regard to</b> that issue: <b>As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that the same <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>a storekeeper as</b> to <b>a money changer, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that the same <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>a storekeeper as</b> to <b>a homeowner. But everyone</b> agrees that <b>if</b> the storekeeper did <b>spend</b> the money, <b>he has misused</b> consecrated property. This indicates that even according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir, whatever transaction he performed did take effect. The Gemara rejects this: <b>Rabbi Meir stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as follows: <b>According to me, if he spent</b> the money <b>he has also not misused</b> consecrated property, <b>but according to you, at least concede to me that</b> the same <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>a storekeeper as to a homeowner. And</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to him: No,</b> I do not concede to you even with regard to this point, as I hold that the same <i>halakha</i> applies to a storekeeper <b>as</b> to <b>a money changer.</b>
The Gemara records a discussion as to the reasons for the rulings of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda. <b>Rav says:</b>

Daf 54a

<b>We reviewed all angles</b> of the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir,</b> i.e., we have examined all of Rabbi Meir’s statements with regard to consecrated property, <b>and we did not find</b> that he holds that <b>consecrated</b> property <b>is not desacralized</b> if it is misused <b>unwittingly</b> but it <b>is desacralized</b> if misused <b>intentionally.</b>
<b>And</b> as for <b>our mishna,</b> which indicates that this is Rabbi Meir’s opinion, it should not be understood as Rabbi Meir’s opinion with regard to consecrated property in general, but <b>with regard to</b> a case where a priest betrothed a woman using <b>priestly tunics that have not worn out</b> and that can still be worn during the Temple service. If a priest betrothed a woman with such garments, Rabbi Meir holds that if he did so unwittingly she is not betrothed, since clothes of this kind are not desacralized, and do not become hers. This is <b>because they were</b> initially <b>given</b> on the condition that the priests may <b>benefit from them</b> even when not performing the Temple service, <b>since the Torah was not given to the ministering angels.</b> It is impossible for a priest to wear the garments only at the moment he is performing the service and at no other time. Therefore, these garments are desacralized only if he intended to desacralize them.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with Rav’s statement. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear:</b> With regard to <b>priestly tunics that have worn out,</b> one <b>misuses</b> property consecrated to the Temple <b>by</b> using <b>them;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. What, is it not</b> so that this <i>halakha</i> would apply <b>even</b> if <b>they had not worn out,</b> and the <i>tanna</i> wanted to teach the additional <i>halakha</i> that it is still a transgression even after they are no longer fit for use? The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>specifically</b> to garments that <b>have worn out.</b> Since these cannot be used by priests, the permission to use them for non-sacred purposes lapses, and they are like other consecrated property that is subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with the explanation of Rabbi Meir’s statement. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: One</b> is liable for <b>misuse</b> of property consecrated to the Temple <b>by</b> using <b>new</b> shekels, i.e., those given this year, which are used to purchase animals for this year’s offerings, <b>but one</b> is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misuse</b> of property consecrated to the Temple <b>by</b> using <b>old</b> shekels, given by those who failed to give the previous year’s half-shekel, since these old shekels are used not to purchase offerings but for Temple maintenance; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says: One</b> is liable for <b>misuse</b> of property consecrated to the Temple <b>even by</b> using <b>old</b> shekels, <b>as Rabbi Meir would say: One</b> is liable for <b>misuse</b> of property consecrated to the Temple not only <b>by</b> using money designated to purchase offerings, but even with <b>the remainder of the chamber,</b> i.e., the money that remained in the chamber after money was taken to purchase the animals used in communal offerings.
The Gemara continues the question: <b>But why</b> should one be liable for using the old shekels? <b>Let us say</b> the same logic: One is not liable, <b>because they were</b> initially <b>given</b> on the condition that people may <b>benefit</b> from them, <b>since the Torah was not given to</b> the <b>ministering angels</b> and people could not help but benefit from them. This is <b>as</b> the money to repair <b>the wall of the city and its towers comes from the remainder of the chamber, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 4:2): <b>The wall of the city, its towers, and all</b> of the <b>requirements of the city</b> of Jerusalem <b>come from the remainder of the chamber.</b> It is not possible for passersby to avoid benefiting from the shade provided by the walls of the city. The Gemara answers: <b>Do not say</b> that the opinion that one is liable for misuse of property consecrated to the Temple by using money from the remainder of the chamber is that of <b>Rabbi Meir. Rather,</b> emend the mishna and <b>say</b> that it is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yishmael bar Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> With regard to <b>stones</b> of the walls and towers <b>of Jerusalem that fell, one</b> is liable for <b>misuse</b> of property consecrated to the Temple <b>by</b> using <b>them;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> This indicates that according to Rabbi Meir, the use of even such stones renders one liable, despite the fact that it is not possible for people to avoid benefiting from them. The Gemara again answers: <b>Do not say</b> that this <i>baraita</i> is recording the statement of <b>Rabbi Meir. Rather,</b> emend the <i>baraita</i> and <b>say</b> that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>If</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, is Jerusalem consecrated</b> at all? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Nedarim</i> 10b): If one says that an item shall be considered <b>like the lamb</b> of the daily offering, <b>like the</b> animals designated as offerings and kept in special <b>enclosures, like the wood</b> of the altar, <b>like the fires</b> on the altar, <b>like the Sanctuary, like the altar,</b> or <b>like Jerusalem,</b> it is a vow and he is prohibited to derive benefit from the item, as he has compared it to something consecrated. The essence of a vow creating a prohibition is the statement that a certain item shall be like a consecrated item. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Anyone who says</b> that an item shall be considered <b>Jerusalem has not said anything,</b> indicating that Rabbi Yehuda holds that Jerusalem is not consecrated.
<b>And if you would say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda’s reason is not that he holds that Jerusalem is not consecrated, but <b>because</b> the one stating the vow <b>did not say: Like Jerusalem,</b> but stated only that the item shall be considered Jerusalem, which is not a clear expression of a vow, <b>but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Nedarim</i> 1:6) that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Anyone who says</b> that an item shall be considered <b>like Jerusalem has not said anything, until he vows by</b> comparing the item to <b>an item that is sacrificed in Jerusalem.</b> This indicates that he holds that Jerusalem itself is not consecrated.

Daf 54b

The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> and the mishna in tractate <i>Nedarim</i> <b>are two <i>tanna’im</i> and</b> they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> concerning whether or not he holds that Jerusalem itself was sanctified.
<b>Ulla said</b> a different opinion <b>in the name of bar Padda: Rabbi Meir would say: Consecrated</b> property <b>is desacralized</b> if misused <b>intentionally;</b> it <b>is not desacralized</b> if misused <b>unwittingly. And they said</b> that consecrated property that is misused <b>unwittingly is desacralized only with regard to an offering,</b> i.e., the one who misused it is liable to bring a guilt-offering for his action, but the property remains consecrated. The Gemara asks: <b>But since it is not desacralized</b> when misused unwittingly, <b>for what</b> reason is he <b>rendered liable</b> to bring <b>an offering,</b> as the action had no effect?
<b>Rather, when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>he explained</b> it this way <b>in the name of bar Padda: Rabbi Meir would say: Consecrated</b> property <b>is desacralized</b> if misused <b>intentionally;</b> it <b>is not desacralized</b> if misused <b>unwittingly. And they said</b> that consecrated property that is misused <b>unwittingly is desacralized only with regard to eating.</b> If one ate consecrated food, thereby consuming it completely, he is liable to bring an offering. If he merely misused consecrated money it retains its sanctity and is not desacralized, and he is not liable to bring an offering.
§ <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir with regard to</b> second <b>tithe</b> in that it is considered consecrated, <b>as</b> the <b><i>tanna</i> taught us an unattributed</b> mishna <b>in accordance with his</b> opinion. <b>And</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda with regard to consecrated</b> property, <b>as</b> the <b><i>tanna</i> taught us an unattributed</b> mishna <b>in accordance with his</b> opinion.
The Gemara clarifies this statement: <b>What is</b> the unattributed mishna that is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir with regard to</b> second <b>tithe?</b> It is <b>as we learned</b> (<i>Pe’a</i> 7:6): It is prohibited to eat or derive benefit from fruit during the first three years after the tree is planted. The fruit of the fourth year is to be taken to Jerusalem and eaten there. With regard to <b>a vineyard</b> in its <b>fourth year, Beit Shammai say: It does not have</b> the <i>halakha</i> of adding <b>one-fifth,</b> i.e., if the owner himself redeems the fruit to bring money to Jerusalem to spend on food there, as one may also do with second tithe, he does not add one-fifth to its value but redeems it for its true value. <b>And it</b> also <b>does not have</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>disposal,</b> i.e., there is no obligation to dispose of it on the eve of Passover of the fourth year of the Sabbatical cycle, when all tithes that have not yet been separated must be disposed of. <b>And Beit Hillel say: It does have</b> the <i>halakha</i> of adding one-fifth and the <i>halakha</i> of disposal.
That mishna continues: Furthermore, <b>Beit Shammai say: It has</b> the mitzva requiring the owner of the vineyard to leave <b>individual fallen grapes</b> for the poor <b>[<i>peret</i>], and it has</b> the mitzva requiring the owner to leave <b>incompletely formed clusters</b> of grapes for the poor <b>[<i>olelot</i>].</b> Since the vineyard is considered the owner’s property during this year, he must leave these gifts for the poor. <b>And Beit Hillel say: All of it</b> goes <b>to the winepress</b> to make wine. Since the grapes have sanctity, he is not obligated to leave these gifts for the poor.
The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Beit Hillel? They derive</b> a verbal analogy from the word <b>“holy”</b> stated with regard to a fourth-year vineyard, as the verse states: “Holy, for giving praise to the Lord” (Leviticus 19:24), <b>from “holy”</b> stated with regard to second <b>tithe,</b> as the verse states: “Holy to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:30). This verbal analogy teaches the following: <b>Just as</b> second <b>tithe has</b> the <i>halakha</i> of adding <b>one-fifth and it has</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>disposal, so too,</b> the <b>fourth-year vineyard has</b> the <i>halakha</i> of adding <b>one-fifth and it has</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>disposal. And Beit Shammai do not derive</b> the verbal analogy of <b>“holy”</b> with regard to a fourth-year vineyard and <b>“holy” from</b> second <b>tithe.</b>
The Gemara proceeds to clarify the opinions of Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai with regard to the obligation to leave <i>peret</i> and <i>olelot</i> from a fourth-year vineyard. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Beit Hillel,</b> who <b>say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of fourth-year produce is <b>like</b> the <i>halakha</i> of second <b>tithe, in accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>do they hold</b> with regard to second tithe? <b>If</b> they hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, why</b> does <b>all of it</b> go <b>to the winepress? Didn’t</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>say</b> that second <b>tithe is</b> itself <b>common,</b> i.e., non-sacred, <b>property,</b> and the owner must therefore leave <i>peret</i> and <i>olelot</i>? <b>Rather, is it not</b> the case that they hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who says that second tithe is consecrated property? The mishna aligning the opinion of Beit Hillel with that of Rabbi Meir is tantamount to there being an unattributed mishna in accordance with Rabbi Meir’s opinion, as the <i>halakha</i> is generally in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel.
The Gemara continues with the explanation of Rav Naḥman’s statement: <b>What is</b> the unattributed mishna that is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda with regard to consecrated</b> property? <b>As we learned</b> (<i>Me’ila</i> 21a): In a case where one sent an agent to buy something on his behalf and unwittingly gave him consecrated money to use, if he <b>sent</b> it <b>in the possession of</b> a halakhically <b>competent</b> person <b>and remembered</b> that it was consecrated money <b>before</b> the agent <b>reached the storekeeper, the storekeeper</b> will have <b>misused consecrated</b> property <b>when he will</b> later <b>spend</b> the money. This indicates that one is liable for misuse of consecrated property even when one acts unwittingly, as the storekeeper did.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> an unattributed mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda with regard to</b> second <b>tithe? But didn’t we learn</b> (<i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 4:3): With regard to <b>one who redeems his</b> own <b>second tithe, he adds to it its one-fifth, whether</b> the tithe was <b>from his</b> crop or <b>given to him as a gift.</b> The Gemara clarifies: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this mishna? <b>If we say it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, can one give</b> second tithe <b>to</b> another <b>as a gift? But didn’t he say</b> that second <b>tithe is property</b> belonging to the <b>Most High,</b> which means it is not one’s own to give to another as a gift? <b>Rather, is it not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that second tithe is common property, and consequently this unattributed mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda with regard to second tithe?
The Gemara answers: <b>No, actually</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and with what are we dealing here?</b> It is not a situation where one gave second tithe itself as a gift, but <b>where he gave him</b> his entire crop <b>in its</b> state of being <b>untithed produce.</b> Consequently, the portion he gave him included tithes that had not yet been separated, <b>and he holds</b> that <b>gifts that have not been separated are not considered as though they have been separated.</b> One does not categorize the untithed produce as a mixture of regular produce and tithes, but as a non-sacred category in and of itself. Since the second tithe has not yet been separated, the produce has no sanctity, and he can give it as a gift.
The Gemara continues its line of inquiry: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another unattributed mishna in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda (<i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 4:6): With regard to <b>one who redeems his</b> own <b>fourth-year produce, he adds to it its one-fifth, whether</b> the produce was <b>from his</b> crop or was <b>given to him as a gift.</b> The Gemara inquires: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this mishna? <b>If we say</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, can one give</b> produce of the fourth year <b>to</b> another as a gift? <b>But didn’t he derive</b> that one must add one-fifth from the verbal analogy of <b>“holy”</b> for fourth-year fruit from <b>“holy” from</b> second <b>tithe?</b> This would mean that fourth-year fruit, like second tithe, is property of the Most High and cannot be given as a gift. <b>Rather, is it not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and with what are we dealing here?</b> It is not a situation where one gave fully grown fourth-year fruit but <b>where he gave him</b> the fruit <b>when it was a bud. And this is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, who says: A bud</b> of a fruit <b>is forbidden</b> as <i>orla</i>, <b>because it is</b> already considered <b>a fruit.</b> Rabbi Meir, by contrast, holds that a fruit bud is not considered fruit. Therefore, the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>orla</i> and fourth-year fruit apply only to fruit that has grown, whereas beforehand it can be given as a gift.
The Gemara continues its line of inquiry: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another unattributed mishna in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda (<i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 4:6): If one was selling second-tithe produce, and the buyer <b>pulled tithe worth a <i>sela</i> from him,</b> thereby acquiring it, <b>and did not manage to redeem it until</b> its value <b>stood at two</b> <i>sela</i>, and he had not yet paid the seller, the buyer <b>gives a <i>sela</i></b> to the seller, <b>and he</b> thereby <b>gains a <i>sela</i> and the second tithe is his,</b> since he acquired it when he pulled it and the price was fixed at that point. The Gemara inquires: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this mishna? <b>If we say</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, why does</b> the buyer <b>gain a <i>sela</i>? The Merciful One states</b> in the Torah with regard to the redemption of consecrated property: <b>And he will give the money and it will be assured to him</b> (see Leviticus 27:19), from which it is derived that one acquires consecrated property only after paying money. This means that the value of the second tithe increased before he acquired it. <b>Rather, is it not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that second tithe is common property, and it is acquired from the moment he pulled it?
The Gemara confirms: <b>Actually,</b> this mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> Nevertheless, Rav Naḥman’s statement that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to second tithe is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir is still correct, <b>as here</b> there is <b>one unattributed</b> mishna that is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, while <b>here</b> there are <b>two unattributed</b> <i>mishnayot</i> that indicate that Beit Hillel’s opinion is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, the one in tractate <i>Ma’aser Sheni</i>, and one in tractate <i>Eduyyot</i> (4:2).
The Gemara asks: <b>But if an unattributed</b> mishna is stated that way <b>specifically</b> to teach the <i>halakha</i>, <b>what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> if it is <b>one unattributed</b> mishna or <b>two unattributed</b> <i>mishnayot</i>? The Gemara suggests an alternate reasoning. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, since we learned</b> in a mishna in the <b>preferred</b> tractate, <i>Eduyyot</i>, <b>in accordance with his</b> opinion. Since the <i>halakha</i> is ruled in accordance with all of the <i>mishnayot</i> in <i>Eduyyot</i>, the fact that the opinion of Beit Hillel in that tractate is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir means that the <i>halakha</i> should be decided accordingly.

Daf 55a

The Gemara continues its discussion of the desacralizing of consecrated property. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Shekalim</i> 20a): If there was <b>an animal</b> fit for the altar <b>that was found</b> straying, <b>from Jerusalem</b> and as far <b>as Migdal Eder, and</b> similarly if it was found <b>within that distance</b> from Jerusalem <b>in any</b> other <b>direction,</b> it is presumed that the animal came from Jerusalem. Most of the animals in Jerusalem were designated for offerings, and presumably this one was as well. <b>Males</b> are presumed to be <b>burnt-offerings,</b> as only males can be brought as burnt-offerings. <b>Females</b> are presumed to be <b>peace-offerings,</b> as it is permitted to bring a female peace-offering.
The Gemara questions this: <b>But are males</b> only <b>burnt-offerings and not</b> also <b>peace-offerings?</b> As peace-offerings can be male or female, a male animal that was found might have been designated as a peace-offering. <b>Rabbi Oshaya said:</b> We are not speaking <b>here</b> of bringing the animals themselves as offerings. Rather, <b>we are dealing with one who comes to obligate</b> himself to consecrate <b>their value.</b> The finder wants to consecrate the value of the animal in case it had been designated as an offering, thereby redeeming the animal and desacralizing it, <b>and this is</b> what the mishna is <b>saying:</b> In the case of males <b>we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> they are <b>burnt-offerings,</b> so the money must be consecrated for the purpose of burnt-offerings as well as peace-offerings. <b>And this is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says: Consecrated</b> property <b>is desacralized</b> if it is misused <b>intentionally.</b> Therefore, he may redeem the animal and must use the money to purchase both a peace-offering and a burnt-offering, thereby avoiding all uncertainty.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> can something that has <b>inherent sanctity,</b> such as an animal that has been designated as an offering, <b>be desacralized? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Me’ila</i> 19b): <b>There is no misuse after misuse with regard to consecrated</b> property? This means that if one misuses consecrated property, the item is immediately desacralized and the prohibition of misuse no longer applies to it. This is so <b>apart from</b> the case of the misuse of <b>an animal</b> designated as an offering <b>and</b> apart <b>from</b> the case of the misuse of <b>service vessels alone.</b> These do not become desacralized when misused, because they have inherent sanctity.
That mishna continues: <b>How</b> so? If someone <b>was riding on</b> a consecrated <b>animal,</b> and <b>another came</b> after him <b>and</b> also <b>rode</b> on it, and yet <b>another came and rode</b> on it, <b>they have all misused</b> consecrated property. Similarly, if one <b>was drinking from a golden cup</b> used in the Temple service, and <b>another came and drank</b> from it, and yet <b>another came and drank</b> from it, <b>they have all misused</b> consecrated property. The Gemara asks: As this indicates that an item that has inherent sanctity is never desacralized, how can it be redeemed? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> mishna, from tractate <i>Me’ila</i>, <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> whereas <b>this</b> mishna, from tractate <i>Shekalim</i>, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Let us hear,</b> i.e., infer, <b>from</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir: Didn’t Rabbi Yehuda say</b> that <b>consecrated</b> property <b>is desacralized</b> if used <b>unwittingly, and</b> yet those items that have <b>inherent sanctity are not desacralized.</b> According <b>to Rabbi Meir as well, although consecrated</b> property <b>is desacralized</b> if used <b>intentionally,</b> items that have <b>inherent sanctity</b> should <b>not be desacralized.</b> The Gemara answers that there is a difference between the two opinions. <b>There,</b> in the case underlying Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion, the one who misuses the consecrated item unwittingly <b>does not intend to withdraw it to a non-sacred</b> state but merely to use it, which is why an item that has inherent sanctity is not desacralized; whereas <b>here,</b> in the case underlying Rabbi Meir’s opinion, one who acts intentionally <b>does intend to withdraw it to a non-sacred</b> state, so even an item that has inherent sanctity can be desacralized.
The Gemara questions Rav Oshaya’s explanation of the mishna: <b>Say that you have heard Rabbi Meir</b> express the opinion that one can desacralize a consecrated item <b>in</b> the case of <b>offerings of the most sacred order,</b> but <b>did you hear him</b> express this opinion <b>in</b> the case of <b>offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> e.g., a peace-offering? If Rabbi Meir holds that offerings of lesser sanctity cannot be desacralized, the explanation of Rabbi Oshaya would be insufficient, as it does not account for the possibility that the animal is a peace-offering. <b>One of the Sages, and his name was Rabbi Ya’akov, said to him:</b> This is learned by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: If <b>offerings of the most sacred order</b> can <b>be desacralized,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> the case that this <i>halakha</i> would apply to <b>offerings of lesser sanctity?</b>
<b>It was also stated: Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Akiva, says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: Consecrated</b> property <b>is desacralized</b> when misused <b>intentionally,</b> but it <b>is not desacralized</b> when misused <b>unwittingly.</b> This applies <b>both</b> to <b>offerings of the most sacred order and</b> to <b>offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: If <b>offerings of the most sacred order</b> can <b>be desacralized,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> the case that this <i>halakha</i> would apply to <b>offerings of lesser sanctity?</b>

Daf 55b

<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan wondered about</b> Rabbi Oshaya’s explanation of the mishna: <b>And does one say to a person: Arise and sin in order that you may gain?</b> Even if consecrated property can be desacralized intentionally, one is not allowed to redeem an animal designated to be an offering. <b>Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The mishna does not refer to redeeming an unblemished animal but to a case where the one who found the animal <b>waits for it until it develops a blemish.</b> At that point it would no longer have inherent sanctity but merely sanctity that inheres in its value, so the animal may be redeemed. <b>And he brings two</b> unblemished <b>animals</b> of the same value, <b>and stipulates</b> that if the animal he found was a burnt-offering, the first animal should be a burnt-offering in its stead while the other should be a voluntary peace-offering. And if the animal he found was a peace-offering, the second animal should be a peace-offering in its stead and the first should be a voluntary burnt-offering. After doing so he may eat the animal he found.
The Gemara continues to clarify the mishna. <b>The Master says</b> (55a): <b>Males</b> are presumed to be <b>burnt-offerings,</b> as only males may be brought as burnt-offerings. The Gemara asks: Why should a male necessarily be a burnt-offering; <b>perhaps it is a thanks-offering,</b> which can also be brought from a male animal? The Gemara answers: The mishna means <b>that</b> he must <b>also bring</b> a third animal and make a similar stipulation, that it should be either <b>a thanks-offering</b> in its stead or a voluntary one. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if he brings a third animal as a thanks-offering, doesn’t a thanks-offering <b>require</b> the bringing of <b>bread</b> as well? The Gemara answers: <b>He brings bread as well.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps it is a guilt-offering,</b> which is also brought only from male animals? The Gemara answers: The animal for <b>a guilt-offering</b> is <b>in its second year, and</b> the mishna is referring to a case where <b>an</b> animal <b>in its first year was found.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps it is the guilt-offering of a leper</b> or <b>the guilt-offering of a nazirite,</b> which are brought from animals in their first year? The Gemara answers: Lepers and nazirites are <b>not common,</b> and there is no need to be concerned about that possibility.
The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps it is a Paschal offering,</b> which is also brought from male animals? The Gemara answers: That is not likely, because with regard to <b>a Paschal offering,</b> if it is up to or <b>in its time</b> to be slaughtered, the owners <b>carefully guard it</b> to prevent it from going missing. <b>And</b> if it is a Paschal offering <b>that</b> is <b>not</b> offered <b>in its</b> proper <b>time,</b> but was left over and is offered later, <b>it</b> has the same <i>halakha</i> <b>as a peace-offering.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And perhaps</b> the animal he found <b>is a firstborn</b> animal, which can only be brought from male animals, <b>or</b> animal <b>tithe,</b> which can brought from male animals? The Gemara answers: <b>With regard to which <i>halakha</i></b> would the possibility that it is a firstborn or animal tithe need to be taken into account? It is with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that one is permitted <b>to eat them in their blemished</b> state, as firstborns and animal tithes do not need to be redeemed if they develop a blemish, but are eaten as such. <b>These</b> found animals <b>as well are eaten</b> only <b>in their blemished</b> state, as one may not redeem and eat them until they develop a blemish, as explained previously.
<b>The Master says</b> above: <b>Females</b> are presumed to be <b>peace-offerings,</b> as it is permitted to bring a female peace-offering. The Gemara asks: <b>Perhaps it is a thanks-offering,</b> which can also be brought from female animals? The Gemara answers: The mishna means <b>that</b> he must also <b>bring</b> a third animal and make a similar stipulation, that it is either a <b>thanks-offering</b> in the stead of the found animal, or a gift offering. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if he brings a third animal as a thanks-offering, doesn’t a thanks-offering <b>require</b> the bringing of <b>bread</b> as well? The Gemara answers: <b>He brings bread as well.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps it is a sin-offering,</b> as it is permitted to bring a female sin-offering? The Gemara answers: The animal for <b>a sin-offering</b> is always <b>in its first year, and</b> the mishna is referring to a case where <b>an</b> animal <b>in its second year was found.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> it was <b>a sin-offering whose year had passed</b> without having been sacrificed? The <i>halakha</i> in such a case is that the animal is left to die. The Gemara answers: Such a case is <b>not common,</b> and there is no need to be concerned about such a possibility.
The Gemara asks: This is the case if the animal was in its second year, but <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> if it <b>was found</b> when it was <b>in its first year?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Ḥananya ben Ḥakhinai says:</b> If one found <b>a goat in its first year,</b> it is brought <b>as a sin-offering.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Can it enter your mind</b> that it is brought <b>as a sin</b>-<b>offering?</b> How can he sacrifice the animal as a sin-offering due to a mere possibility that it had been designated as a sin-offering? One cannot bring a voluntary sin-offering. <b>Rather, Abaye says:</b> He treats it <b>as</b> though it were <b>a sin-offering,</b> i.e., he <b>conveys it into a cell and it dies on its own.</b> Since it might be a lost sin-offering, it must be left to die.
<b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 1:15): <b>One may not purchase an animal with second-tithe money</b> outside of Jerusalem,

Daf 56a

<b>and if one purchased</b> an animal <b>unwittingly,</b> without realizing he was using second tithe money, <b>the money returns to its place,</b> meaning that it is considered to be an erroneous transaction and is void, because the purchaser would prefer to bring the second tithe money to Jerusalem rather than to travel with an animal to bring as an offering. If he purchased it <b>intentionally,</b> the animal <b>is brought up and eaten in</b> its proper <b>place,</b> i.e., in Jerusalem. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to</b> one who acted <b>with intent, and purchased</b> the animal from <b>the outset for the sake of a peace-offering,</b> and in any case had to bring the animal to Jerusalem. <b>But with regard to</b> one who acted <b>with intent to withdraw the second-tithe money</b> from its consecrated state <b>to a desacralized</b> state, <b>whether</b> his act was <b>unwitting,</b> in which case it is an erroneous transaction, or <b>intentional, the money returns to its place.</b>
The Gemara questions this statement: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If the second tithe was used <b>intentionally, he has betrothed</b> the woman with it, and the betrothal, which is a type of acquisition, is effective? <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> in the mishna is based upon the assumption that <b>a woman knows that second-tithe money is not desacralized by her</b> acceptance of the betrothal, <b>and</b> it is as though she has agreed that <b>she</b> would <b>ascend and eat it in Jerusalem.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya objects to this: But</b> there are cases of <b>a non-kosher animal, slaves, or land,</b> with regard to which <b>a person knows that second-tithe money is not desacralized by</b> being used to purchase <b>them, and we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 1:7): <b>One may not purchase a non-kosher animal, slaves, or land with second-tithe money, even in Jerusalem. And if one did purchase</b> them, <b>he must eat</b> other food <b>corresponding to their</b> value. He must take an equivalent sum of money and use it to desacralize the money in the seller’s possession, after which he proceeds to bring this money to Jerusalem and use it to buy food, which he will then consume. In this case, the seller is also presumably aware that the money is second tithe and that he himself will need to take it to Jerusalem, as was presumed in the case of the betrothed woman, so why is the <i>halakha</i> not the same?
<b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>here,</b> in the case of the mishna, <b>we are dealing with a woman devoted to the meticulous observance of mitzvot, especially the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual purity, <i>teruma</i>, and tithes [<i>ḥavera</i>], who knows</b> the laws of tithes, and accepts it for betrothal with the awareness that she must take it to Jerusalem. An ordinary person, however, is not well-versed in these <i>halakhot</i>, so in the case of the purchase of an animal the seller thinks that the second-tithe money has been desacralized through the purchase of the non-kosher animal.
<b>The Master said: If one did purchase</b> them, <b>he must eat</b> other food <b>corresponding to their</b> value. The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> should he do so? Why not say that <b>the money must return to its place,</b> just <b>as</b> was the ruling <b>there,</b> as Rabbi Yehuda said with regard to one who acted with intent to desacralize the second tithe, where the seller was penalized for acquiescing to the sale?
<b>Shmuel says:</b>

Daf 56b

The case here is <b>where</b> the seller <b>fled</b> with the money, and there is no way of voiding the sale and returning the money to the purchaser. The Gemara comments: <b>And the reason is that he fled, but had he not fled, we would penalize the seller</b> by requiring him to return the money. The Gemara asks: <b>And let us penalize the buyer</b> and require him to take an equivalent sum of money to Jerusalem. The Gemara answers: It is <b>not the mouse</b> that <b>steals, but the hole</b> that <b>steals.</b> In other words, a mouse cannot steal an item unless he has a hole in which to hide it. Here too, the money would not have been desacralized without the help of the seller.
The Gemara questions this logic: <b>But if not</b> for the <b>mouse, what has the hole done?</b> Since they both are integral to the prohibited act, each of them is deserving of a penalty. The Gemara answers: <b>It stands to reason</b> that <b>anywhere that the forbidden</b> item <b>is,</b> i.e., anywhere that the money is, and in this case it is with the seller, <b>there we</b> should <b>penalize.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with <i>orla</i>,</b> i.e., fruit grown during a tree’s first three years, or <b>with diverse kinds in a vineyard,</b> i.e., grain and grapes planted together, or <b>with an ox that is</b> sentenced to be <b>stoned, or with a heifer whose neck is broken,</b> or <b>with</b> the <b>leper’s birds</b> which are designated for his offering, <b>or with a nazirite’s hair, or</b> with <b>a firstborn donkey, or</b> with <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk, or</b> with <b>non-sacred</b> animals <b>that were slaughtered in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard,</b> if he betroths her with any of these items, the woman <b>is not betrothed,</b> since it is prohibited to derive benefit from any of these items. By contrast, if <b>one sold them and betrothed</b> a woman <b>with</b> the <b>money</b> received from <b>their</b> sale, <b>she is betrothed,</b> as in these cases one may derive benefit from the money he receives in exchange for the forbidden item.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara explains the source of the <i>halakha</i> that it is prohibited to derive benefit from the items mentioned in the mishna. <b>With <i>orla</i>: From where do we</b> derive that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from <i>orla</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “And shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then you shall count the fruit thereof as forbidden; three years shall it be as <b>forbidden [<i>arelim</i>]</b> to you; <b>it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 19:23). From this verse, <b>I have</b> derived <b>only a prohibition</b> against <b>eating</b> it. <b>From where</b> do I derive that one may not even derive <b>benefit</b> from it? From where do we derive <b>that one may not</b> derive <b>benefit from it</b> in another manner, <b>and one may not paint with</b> the dye that can be extracted from the fruit, <b>and one may not light a lamp with</b> its oil? <b>The verse states: “Then you shall count the fruit thereof [<i>orlato</i>] as forbidden [<i>araltem</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 19:23), <b>to include all these</b> types of benefit in the prohibition.
The mishna stated that one may not betroth a woman <b>with diverse kinds in a vineyard. From where do we</b> derive that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from diverse kinds in a vineyard? <b>Ḥizkiyya said: The verse states:</b> “You shall not sow your vineyard with diverse kinds; lest the growth of the seed that you have sown be forbidden [<i>pen tikdash</i>], together with the yield of the vineyard” (Deuteronomy 22:9). Ḥizkiyya expounds <b>“lest</b> the growth of the seed that you have sown <b>be forbidden [<i>pen tikdash</i>]”</b> as: <b>Lest it be burned [<i>pen tukad esh</i>],</b> indicating that the seed of diverse kinds must be destroyed by fire, so that no benefit is derived from it.
<b>Rav Ashi says</b> that the phrase “<i>pen tikdash</i>” indicates that it is comparable to consecrated property, as if it said: <b>Lest it become consecrated [<i>kodesh</i>],</b> and one is therefore prohibited from deriving benefit from it, just as one may not derive benefit from consecrated property. The Gemara questions Rav Ashi’s interpretation: <b>If</b> diverse kinds in a vineyard is compared to consecrated property, then <b>just as consecrated</b> property <b>transfers</b> its sanctity to the <b>money</b> with which <b>it</b> is redeemed <b>and becomes desacralized, so too, diverse kinds in a vineyard</b> should <b>transfer</b> their sanctity to the <b>money</b> with which <b>they</b> are redeemed <b>and become desacralized.</b> Contrary to this logic, the mishna taught that if one sells diverse kinds in a vineyard, the proceeds can be used for betrothal, indicating that it is not forbidden to derive benefit from this money. <b>Rather, it is clear</b> that the correct derivation is <b>as</b> that <b>of Ḥizkiyya.</b>
The Gemara continues its analysis of the mishna: <b>From where</b> is it derived that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from <b>an ox that is</b> sentenced to be <b>stoned?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is taught <b>by inference from</b> that <b>which is stated</b> with regard to an ox that killed a person: “And if an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die, <b>the ox shall be stoned,</b> and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be clear” (Exodus 21:28). <b>Don’t I know</b> from this verse <b>that</b> the stoning makes it an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass, and it is prohibited to eat</b> an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass? What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Its flesh shall not be eaten”?</b> The verse <b>is telling you that</b> even <b>if one slaughtered</b> the ox <b>after its verdict had been reached</b> but before it was stoned, it is still <b>prohibited to eat</b> it.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>From where</b> is it derived that one is prohibited <b>from</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from the ox as well? <b>The verse states: “But the owner of the ox shall be clear.”</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred</b> that one may not derive benefit from this ox? <b>Shimon ben Zoma says:</b> This is <b>like a person who says to another: So-and-so was left clear [<i>naki</i>] of his property, and he has no benefit from it at all.</b> Similarly, “But the owner of the ox shall be clear” means that he may not derive any benefit from the ox.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it known <b>that this</b> phrase: <b>“Its flesh shall not be eaten,” comes</b> to teach a <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to</b> a case <b>where he slaughtered</b> the ox <b>after its verdict was reached,</b> but before it was stoned? <b>Perhaps it is permitted</b> to eat the ox <b>if he slaughtered</b> it <b>after its verdict had been reached. And this</b> phrase: <b>“Shall not be eaten,” comes</b> to teach a <i>halakha</i> with regard to a case <b>where they</b> had already <b>stoned it,</b> but not to teach a prohibition against eating it, as that is already known due to the fact that it was stoned. Rather, it comes to prohibit deriving benefit from the ox, <b>and</b> that would be <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Abbahu</b> who <b>says</b> the following, citing <b>Rabbi Elazar.</b>
The Gemara continues the question: <b>As Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>wherever it is stated: “It shall not be eaten”;</b> or <b>“you,”</b> singular, <b>“shall not eat”; or “you,”</b> plural, <b>“shall not eat”; both a prohibition</b> against <b>eating and a prohibition</b> against deriving <b>benefit</b> are indicated. This is so <b>unless the verse specifies for you</b> that one may derive benefit, <b>in the manner that it specified for you with regard to an animal carcass,</b> from which the verse explicitly permits one to derive benefit, as it states: “You may sell it to a foreigner” (Deuteronomy 14:21). Here, too, with regard to the ox that is stoned, the phrase: “Its flesh shall not be eaten,” may serve to teach that one may not derive benefit from the stoned ox.
The Gemara answers: <b>This statement</b> of Rabbi Abbahu <b>applies only</b> to a case <b>where we derive the prohibition</b> against <b>eating from the words: “It may not be eaten,”</b> which is interpreted to include any manner of consumption. But <b>here, the prohibition</b> against <b>eating is derived from: “It shall be stoned,”</b> from which it is understood that since the ox becomes an unslaughtered animal carcass, it may not be eaten. <b>As if it enters your mind that</b> the phrase: “Its flesh may not be eaten,” <b>is written to prohibit</b> one from deriving <b>benefit, let the verse state: “One may not derive benefit.”</b> Why does it refer to eating if that prohibition has already been derived?
<b>Alternatively,</b> even if one would say that the phrase: <b>“It shall not be eaten,”</b> can be used to indicate that it is prohibited to derive benefit from the ox, <b>why do I</b> need the additional words <b>“its flesh”?</b> These words must teach that <b>although he slaughtered</b> the ox <b>like</b> one does with kosher <b>meat,</b> after it was condemned to be stoned, it remains <b>forbidden</b> and cannot be eaten.
<b>Mar Zutra objects to this: But say</b> that <b>this</b> prohibition against eating the ox <b>applies</b> only <b>where he examined</b> a sharp <b>stone</b> to ensure that it had no nicks, <b>and slaughtered with it</b> in a halakhically acceptable manner. That action could <b>be considered like stoning,</b> since in any event the ox was killed by a stone. The Torah teaches that even if it was killed in this manner, one is prohibited from eating it. <b>But</b> if <b>he slaughtered it with a knife,</b> he should <b>not</b> be prohibited from eating it. The Gemara expresses surprise at this reasoning: <b>Was a knife written in the Torah?</b> If one slaughters the animal in a halakhically acceptable manner, this is called slaughtering, not stoning. <b>And moreover, it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ḥullin</i> 1:2): One may <b>slaughter with anything</b> that cuts cleanly, <b>whether with a stone, whether with glass, whether with the stalk of a reed.</b> Consequently, there is no difference in the <i>halakha</i> with regard to using a knife or a sharp stone.
The Gemara asks: <b>And now that we have derived</b> both <b>the prohibition</b> against <b>eating and the prohibition</b> against <b>benefiting</b> from an ox sentenced to be stoned <b>from: “It shall not be eaten,” what</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>does that</b> other phrase: <b>“But the owner of the ox shall be clear,” come</b> to teach? The Gemara answers: It comes <b>to</b> teach the prohibition against deriving <b>benefit</b> from <b>its hide</b> after it has been killed. Were it not for this phrase, it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that since <b>it is written: “Its flesh shall not be eaten,”</b> only <b>its flesh is forbidden, but its hide is permitted.</b> Therefore, the words “and the owner of the ox is clean” teach that its hide is forbidden as well.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according <b>to those <i>tanna’im</i> who expound this</b> phrase: <b>“The owner of the ox shall be clear,” to</b> teach that the owner of an innocuous ox, i.e., one that is not known to cause damage with the intent to injure, is exempt from the payment of <b>half</b> of the <b>indemnity</b> incurred if that ox killed a person, or that he is exempt from <b>payment</b> of damages <b>for</b> miscarried <b>offspring</b> if his ox gores a pregnant woman and causes her to miscarry; <b>from where do they</b> derive this prohibition against <b>benefiting from</b> the ox’s <b>hide?</b>
The Gemara answers: They derive it <b>from</b> the wording: <b>“Its flesh</b> may not be eaten [<i>velo ye’akhel <b>et besaro</b></i><b>].”</b> The verse could have been formulated: <i>Velo ye’akhel besaro</i>, which already means: And its flesh shall not be eaten. The addition of the word “<i>et</i>” teaches that the prohibition applies also to <b>that which is secondary to the flesh,</b> i.e., the hide. The Gemara asks: <b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, who derives the prohibition against benefiting from the hide from the verse: “But the owner of the ox shall be clear,” what does he learn from the additional word “<i>et</i>”?

Daf 57a

The Gemara answers: This Sage <b>does not interpret</b> the word <b>“<i>et</i>”</b> as a means to derive new <i>halakhot</i>. He considers the word “<i>et</i>” to be an ordinary part of the sentence structure and not a source for exegetical exposition. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Shimon HaAmasoni, and some say</b> that it was <b>Neḥemya HaAmasoni, would interpret all</b> occurrences of the word <b>“<i>et</i>” in the Torah,</b> deriving additional <i>halakhot</i> with regard to the particular subject matter. <b>Once he reached</b> the verse: <b>“You shall fear the Lord your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:13), which is written with the added word “<i>et</i>,” <b>he withdrew</b> from this method of exposition, as whose fear could be an extension of the fear of God?
<b>His students said to him: Our teacher, what will be with all</b> the occurrences of the word <b>“<i>et</i>” that you interpreted</b> until now? <b>He said to them: Just as I received reward for the exposition, so I received reward for</b> my <b>withdrawal</b> from using this method of exposition. The word “<i>et</i>” in this verse was not explained <b>until Rabbi Akiva came and expounded: “You shall fear the Lord your God”:</b> The word “<i>et</i>” serves <b>to include Torah scholars,</b> i.e., that one is commanded to fear them just as one fears God. In any event, Shimon HaAmasoni no longer derived additional <i>halakhot</i> from the word <i>et</i>.
§ The mishna teaches that if a man betroths a woman <b>with a heifer whose neck is broken,</b> she is not betrothed. The Gemara clarifies: <b>From where do we</b> derive that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from a heifer whose neck is broken? <b>The school of Rabbi Yannai said:</b> An expression of <b>atonement was written with regard to it.</b> The verse: “Atone for Your people Israel” (Deuteronomy 21:8), was written with regard to a heifer whose neck was broken, <b>as</b> was also written with regard to <b>sacrificial animals.</b> Therefore, one is prohibited from deriving benefit from it, just as one may not benefit from an offering.
§ The mishna teaches that if a man betroths a woman <b>with the leper’s birds,</b> she is not betrothed. The Gemara clarifies: <b>From where do we</b> derive that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from a leper’s birds? <b>As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> A mitzva that <b>enables is stated</b> in the verses with regard to a leper, <b>and</b> the Torah also discusses a mitzva that <b>atones,</b> both of which are performed <b>inside</b> the Temple. Here, a mitzva that enables is a reference to the leper’s guilt-offering, which enables him to partake of offerings; and a mitzva that atones is a reference to all other offerings. <b>And</b> mitzva that <b>enables is stated</b> in the verses with regard to a leper, <b>and</b> the Torah also discusses a mitzva that <b>atones,</b> both of which are performed <b>outside</b> the Temple. Here, a mitzva that enables is a reference to the leper’s birds, which permit him to reenter the camp; and a mitzva that atones is a reference to the heifer whose neck is broken, which atones for the inhabitants of the city nearest to an unsolved murder.
<b>Just as</b> in the case of the <b>enabling and atoning</b> rites <b>stated</b> in the Torah that are performed <b>inside</b> the Temple the Torah <b>made</b> the item of <b>the enabling</b> rite, i.e., the leper’s guilt-offering, from which one is prohibited from deriving benefit, <b>like</b> the item of <b>the atoning</b> rite, i.e., offerings in general, <b>so too,</b> in the case of the <b>enabling and atoning</b> rites <b>stated</b> in the Torah that are performed <b>outside</b> the Temple the Torah <b>made</b> the item of <b>the enabling</b> rite, i.e., the leper’s birds, from which one is prohibited from deriving benefit, <b>like</b> the item of <b>the atoning</b> rite, i.e., the heifer whose neck is broken.
<b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disputed the following issue: <b>From when</b> is one <b>prohibited</b> from deriving benefit from <b>the leper’s birds? Rabbi Yoḥanan says: From the moment of</b> their <b>slaughter; and Reish Lakish says: From the moment</b> they are <b>taken</b> and designated to be a leper’s birds. The Gemara explains their respective opinions: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: From the moment of</b> their <b>slaughter,</b> because <b>it is the slaughter that prohibits them,</b> since they are not consecrated beforehand. <b>Reish Lakish says: From the moment</b> they are <b>taken,</b> since this <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived from the heifer whose neck is broken. Just as</b> one is prohibited from deriving benefit from <b>a heifer whose neck is broken during</b> its <b>lifetime, so too,</b> one is prohibited from deriving benefit from the <b>leper’s birds during</b> their <b>lifetime.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to it, <b>the heifer whose neck is broken, itself, from when</b> is it a forbidden item? <b>Rabbi Yannai said: I heard</b> the <b>boundary,</b> i.e., stage, beyond which <b>it</b> is forbidden, <b>but I have forgotten</b> what it is. <b>But the group</b> of scholars <b>were inclined to say</b> that <b>its descent to a hard valley,</b> where its neck is broken, <b>is</b> the action that <b>renders it forbidden.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> so, <b>just as</b> with <b>a heifer whose neck is broken, it is not forbidden from the moment</b> it is <b>taken</b> but only afterward, <b>so too, the leper’s birds should also not be forbidden from the moment</b> they are <b>taken.</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in the case of the heifer, <b>it has another boundary</b> that can render it forbidden, namely its descent to the valley; <b>here,</b> in the case of the leper’s birds, <b>does it have another boundary?</b> It is taken and immediately slaughtered.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Of all clean birds you may eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:11). The superfluous word “all” is stated <b>to include</b> one of the leper’s birds, which is <b>sent away</b> to freedom, while the words: <b>“But these are they of which you shall not eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:12), are stated <b>to include</b> in the prohibition the other, <b>slaughtered</b> bird. Rabbi Yoḥanan asks: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that the bird <b>is forbidden from</b> when it is <b>alive, is</b> a verse <b>necessary</b> to teach that it is forbidden <b>after</b> its <b>slaughter?</b> The Gemara answers: The verse is necessary, <b>lest you say: Just as it is in</b> the case <b>of sacrificial animals, where</b> one is <b>prohibited</b> from deriving benefit from <b>them when</b> they are <b>alive, and</b> the act of <b>slaughter comes and renders them fit</b> to be eaten, so too with regard to the bird. The verse <b>teaches us</b> that with regard to the leper’s bird this is not the case, and it remains forbidden even after it has been slaughtered.
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raised</b> another <b>objection to</b> Reish Lakish: The mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 14:5) teaches that if one <b>slaughtered</b> one of the leper’s birds <b>and it was found</b> to be <b>a bird with a condition that would have caused it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>], a partner is taken for the second,</b> i.e., remaining, bird, <b>while</b> with regard to <b>the first</b> bird, i.e., the <i>tereifa</i>, one <b>is permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that the bird <b>is forbidden from</b> when it is <b>alive, why is</b> one <b>permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit from the first one,</b> if the prohibition took effect before it was slaughtered? Reish Lakish <b>said to him: With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the slaughtered bird <b>was found</b> to be <b>a <i>tereifa</i> in its inner organs,</b> so <b>that</b> the <b>consecration did not take effect at all,</b> as the bird was not fit to be used for this purpose.
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raised</b> another <b>objection to</b> Reish Lakish from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Nega’im</i> 8:8): If he <b>slaughtered</b> the bird <b>without</b> bringing <b>a hyssop, or without</b> bringing <b>cedar wood, or without</b> bringing <b>a scarlet thread,</b> which were all used in the rite, <b>Rabbi Ya’akov says: Since</b> the bird <b>was set aside for its mitzva,</b> it is <b>forbidden</b> anyway. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Since it was not slaughtered in accordance with its mitzva,</b> it is <b>permitted.</b>
Rabbi Yoḥanan infers from this: <b>They disagree only with regard to</b> this issue, that one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Ya’akov, <b>holds</b> that an act of <b>slaughter that is not fit</b> for accomplishing its full ritual purpose <b>is</b> nevertheless <b>considered</b> an act of <b>slaughter,</b> and the bird is therefore forbidden; <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds</b> that an act of <b>slaughter that is not fit</b> for accomplishing its full ritual purpose <b>is not considered</b> an act of <b>slaughter</b> at all, and therefore one is permitted to derive benefit from the bird. <b>But everyone agrees at least</b> that one <b>is not prohibited from</b> deriving <b>benefit from it</b> when it is <b>alive,</b> but only after it has been slaughtered.
Reish Lakish replied: I concede that this <i>baraita</i> does not accord with my opinion, but this issue <b>is</b> a dispute between the <b><i>tanna’im</i>. As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> A mitzva that <b>enables is stated</b> in the verses with regard to a leper, <b>and</b> the Torah also discusses a mitzva that <b>atones,</b> both of which are performed <b>inside</b> the Temple. <b>And</b> a mitzva that <b>enables is stated</b> in the verses with regard to a leper, <b>and</b> the Torah also discusses a mitzva that <b>atones,</b> both of which are performed <b>outside</b> the Temple.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Just as</b> in the case of the <b>enabling and atoning</b> rites <b>stated</b> in the Torah that are performed <b>inside</b> the Temple the Torah <b>made</b> the item of <b>the enabling</b> rite <b>like</b> the item of <b>the atoning</b> rite, <b>so too,</b> in the case of the <b>enabling and atoning</b> rites <b>stated</b> in the Torah that are performed <b>outside</b> the Temple, the Torah <b>made</b> the item of <b>the enabling</b> rite <b>like</b> the item of <b>the atoning</b> rite. The <i>baraita</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael compares the leper’s birds to a heifer whose neck is broken, and therefore would also prohibit one from deriving benefit from the birds before they are slaughtered. The opinion of Reish Lakish is therefore in accordance with that <i>baraita</i>.
With regard to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself,</b> the <i>baraita</i> teaches: The verse states: <b>“Of all clean birds you may eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:11). The superfluous word “all” is stated <b>to include</b> one of <b>the</b> leper’s birds, which is <b>sent away</b> to freedom, while the words: <b>“But these are they of which you shall not eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:12), are stated <b>to include</b> in the prohibition <b>the</b> other, <b>slaughtered</b> bird.
The Gemara questions this interpretation: <b>And I will reverse</b> the exposition, and say that one may derive benefit from the slaughtered bird and not from the one that was sent away. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> The reason to expound the verse as the <i>baraita</i> does is that <b>we have not found</b> kosher <b>living creatures that are</b> permanently <b>forbidden</b> with regard to eating. Therefore, it stands to reason that the slaughtered bird is forbidden, not the living one. <b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak objects to this</b> explanation: <b>But haven’t</b> we found kosher living animals that are permanently forbidden? But <b>there are</b>

Daf 57b

the cases of an animal <b>set aside</b> as an offering to an idol, <b>and</b> an animal that was itself <b>worshipped</b> as an idol, <b>which are living creatures and</b> yet <b>are</b> permanently <b>forbidden.</b> The Gemara answers: There is a difference, as <b>when</b> they are <b>forbidden,</b> they are forbidden only to be used <b>for the Most High,</b> i.e., to be used as offerings in the Temple service, but it is permitted <b>for a common</b> Jew to derive benefit from them.
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya objects to</b> the explanation of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>But</b> an animal that <b>copulated</b> with a woman, and an animal that <b>copulated</b> with a man, <b>in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses, they are living creatures and</b> yet they <b>are</b> permanently <b>forbidden,</b> as the <i>halakha</i> is that these animals are killed, and one is prohibited from deriving benefit from them once they have been sentenced. <b>Rather,</b> the above explanation should be emended to say: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: We have not found most</b> kosher <b>living creatures that are</b> permanently <b>forbidden</b> while they are still alive, and it can be assumed that the inclusion of the verse is referring to that which is generally forbidden, even if there are exceptions.
The Gemara offers another answer to the question of how the <i>baraita</i> knew which bird the verse is permitting. <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: The verse states: “And shall let go</b> the living bird <b>into the open field”</b> (Leviticus 14:7), which indicates that the bird is <b>like a field: Just as a field is permitted, so too, this</b> bird <b>is also permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: Is <b>that</b> word <b>“field” coming to</b> teach <b>this? That</b> word <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The word <b>“field”</b> teaches <b>that one may not stand in Jaffa and throw</b> the bird that is set free <b>to the sea,</b> or stand <b>in Gevat and throw it to the desert, and that he may not stand outside the city and throw it inside the city. Rather, any</b> manner in <b>which he is standing in the city and throws it outside the wall</b> to the field is valid. The word “field” teaches that one must set it free only to the field and nowhere else, not to teach that the bird is permitted.
<b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, the school of Rabbi Yishmael, who derives that one is permitted to derive benefit from the bird based on the word “field,” replies: <b>If so,</b> that this was the only <i>halakha</i> the word is teaching, <b>let the Torah write “field”; what</b> is the significance of <b>“the field”? Conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from it,</b> i.e., both the place to throw the bird and the permission to derive benefit.
<b>Rava says</b> a different answer to the question of how the <i>baraita</i> knew which bird the verse is permitting: <b>The Torah did not say “let go” for</b> it to serve as a <b>stumbling block.</b> If the bird sent free was forbidden, the Torah would not have commanded him to send it away, since people might eat it unwittingly.
§ The mishna teaches that if a man betroths a woman <b>with a nazirite’s hair,</b> she is not betrothed. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from a nazirite’s hair? The Gemara answers: <b>As the verse states</b> with regard to a nazirite: <b>“He shall be holy [<i>kadosh</i>], he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long”</b> (Numbers 6:5), which teaches: <b>His</b> hair <b>growth shall be holy.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the hair of a nazirite can be compared to consecrated property by use of the term “holy,” then <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>consecrated</b> property, it <b>transfers</b> its sanctity to the <b>money</b> with which <b>it</b> is redeemed <b>and</b> it <b>becomes desacralized, so too, a nazirite’s hair should transfer</b> its sanctity to the <b>money</b> with which <b>it</b> is redeemed <b>and</b> the hair itself should become <b>desacralized.</b> This is not the <i>halakha</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>Do we read holy [<i>kodesh</i>]</b> in this verse, which is the term the verse uses for a consecrated item (see Leviticus 22:14)? <b>We read “holy [<i>kadosh</i>].”</b> Since a different conjugation of the term is used, the <i>halakhot</i> of the hair of a nazirite are not derived from those of consecrated property.
§ The mishna teaches that if a man betroths a woman <b>with a firstborn donkey,</b> she is not betrothed. The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a firstborn donkey,</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it <b>is prohibited;</b>this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And Rabbi Shimon permits</b> it. <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said:</b> The mishna can be referring to one who betrothed a woman with a firstborn donkey <b>after</b> it has had its <b>neck broken, and everyone agrees</b> that it is prohibited to derive benefit from the donkey once its neck is broken.
§ The mishna teaches that if a man betroths a woman with <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk,</b> she is not betrothed. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from meat cooked in milk? <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The Torah states <b>three times: “You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk”</b> (Exodus 23:19; Exodus 34:26; Deuteronomy 14:21). <b>One</b> verse serves to teach <b>the prohibition</b> against <b>eating</b> meat cooked in milk, <b>and one</b> verse serves to teach <b>the prohibition</b> against deriving <b>benefit</b> from meat cooked in milk, <b>and one</b> verse serves to teach <b>the prohibition</b> against <b>cooking</b> meat in milk.
The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says:</b> It is <b>prohibited to eat meat</b> cooked <b>in milk but</b> one is <b>permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it, <b>as</b> it <b>is stated: “For you are a holy people to the Lord your God. You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:21), <b>and it states there</b> with regard to the prohibition of an unslaughtered animal carcass: <b>“And you shall be holy men to Me”</b> (Exodus 22:30). Since both verses employ the term “holy” he derives: <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of an animal carcass, it is <b>prohibited to eat</b> it <b>but</b> one is <b>permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it, as the Torah explicitly states that it may be sold to a gentile, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to meat cooked in milk, it is <b>prohibited to eat</b> it <b>but</b> one is <b>permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it.
§ The mishna teaches that if a man betroths a woman with the items it enumerated, <b>or</b> with <b>non-sacred</b> animals <b>that were slaughtered in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard,</b> she is not betrothed. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> i.e., that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from a non-sacred animal that was slaughtered in the Temple courtyard, derived? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Meir: The Torah said: Slaughter for Me,</b> i.e., for offerings to God, <b>in My</b> place, inside the Temple courtyard, <b>and your</b> non-sacred animals that are intended for eating should be slaughtered <b>in your</b> place, outside the Temple courtyard. <b>Just as</b> one is <b>prohibited</b> from deriving benefit from <b>My</b> consecrated animals if they were slaughtered <b>in your</b> place, as one is prohibited from deriving benefit from a consecrated animal slaughtered outside the Temple, <b>so too,</b> one is <b>prohibited</b> from deriving benefit from <b>your</b> non-sacred animals if they were slaughtered <b>in My</b> place.
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> so, <b>just as</b> the act of slaughtering <b>My</b> consecrated animals <b>in your</b> place is <b>punishable by <i>karet</i>, so too,</b> to the act of slaughtering <b>your</b> non-sacred animals <b>in My</b> place should be <b>punishable by <i>karet</i>.</b> To counter this logic, <b>the verse states:</b> “If a man from the house of Israel slaughters an ox or lamb…<b>and has not brought it to the door of the Tent of Meeting to sacrifice an offering to the Lord…and that man shall be cut off”</b> (Leviticus 17:3–4). This teaches that it is only <b>for an offering</b> that one slaughtered outside the Tent of Meeting of the Tabernacle, or the Temple courtyard, that <b>he is punishable with <i>karet</i>,</b> but <b>for non-sacred</b> animals that one slaughtered <b>in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard he is not punishable with <i>karet</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: In light of the above difference in <i>halakha</i> between these two cases, the entire comparison <b>can be refuted</b> in the following manner: <b>What</b> is an aspect unique <b>to</b> slaughtering <b>My</b> consecrated animals <b>in your</b> place? It <b>is</b> that it is <b>punishable by <i>karet</i>,</b> and is therefore a severe prohibition, which could explain the <i>halakha</i> that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from them. The prohibition against slaughtering a non-sacred animal in the Temple courtyard, which is not punishable by <i>karet</i>, could be regarded as a less severe prohibition, and perhaps in this case it is permitted to derive benefit from the slaughtered animal. Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from a non-sacred animal that was slaughtered in the Temple courtyard still does not have a source.
Abaye quotes a lengthy <i>baraita</i> that serves as a source for the <i>halakha</i> that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from a non-sacred animal slaughtered in the Temple courtyard. <b>Rather, Abaye said</b> it is derived <b>from here:</b> The Torah states <b>three verses that</b> have <b>a superfluous</b> element with regard to the various species from which one may bring a peace-offering: The verse <b>“and he slaughters it”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), the verse <b>“and he shall slaughter it”</b> (Leviticus 3:8), and the verse <b>“and he shall slaughter it”</b> (Leviticus 3:13). The Torah could simply have stated: “And he shall slaughter,” without adding: “It.” <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> the term “it” these three times?
The <i>baraita</i> continues: The source for the <i>halakha</i> is <b>because it is stated</b> with regard to the ritual slaughter of animals for meat consumption: <b>“If the place</b> which the Lord your God shall choose to put His name there <b>be too far from you, then you shall slaughter</b> of your herd and of your flock” (Deuteronomy 12:21), from which it is derived: <b>When</b> you are <b>far from the place,</b> i.e., the Temple, <b>you may slaughter</b> non-sacred animals for meat consumption, <b>but you may not slaughter</b> non-sacred animals <b>in a near place,</b> i.e., in the Temple. The verse serves to <b>exclude non-sacred</b> animals, thereby teaching <b>that they may not be slaughtered in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And I have</b> derived the prohibition against slaughtering a non-sacred animal in the Temple courtyard <b>only</b> with regard to <b>unblemished</b> animals, <b>which are fit to be sacrificed. From where</b> do I know <b>to include</b> even <b>blemished</b> animals, which are not fit to be sacrificed, in this prohibition? <b>I include blemished</b> animals <b>since</b> they are at least of <b>the type that is fit</b> to be sacrificed. <b>From where</b> do I know <b>to include the undomesticated animal,</b> which is never sacrificed as an offering, in this prohibition? <b>I include the undomesticated animal since it</b> is rendered fit for consumption <b>by</b> means of <b>slaughtering, like a domesticated animal. From where</b> do I know <b>to include fowl,</b> as the Torah does not mention slaughter with regard to fowl, in this prohibition? <b>The verse states: “And he slaughters it,” “and he shall slaughter it,”</b> as well as <b>“and he shall slaughter it,”</b> employing the addition term “it” each time. These three verses teach that one may not slaughter any non-sacred animal in the Temple courtyard.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one may not slaughter</b> <i>ab initio</i> <b>but if he did slaughter it would be permitted for him</b> to eat it. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “If the place</b> which the Lord your God shall choose to put His name there <b>be too far from you, then you shall slaughter</b> of your herd and of your flock, which the Lord has given you, as I have commanded you, <b>and you shall eat</b> within your gates, after all the desire of your soul” (Deuteronomy 12:21), which is expounded as follows: <b>That which you slaughter in a far place,</b> outside the Temple, <b>you may eat, but you may not eat that which you slaughter in a near place,</b> which <b>excludes non-sacred</b> animals <b>that were slaughtered in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.</b> Therefore, it is prohibited to eat a non-sacred animal slaughtered in the Temple courtyard even after the fact.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the prohibition against eating the meat after the fact applies to <b>unblemished</b> animals,

Daf 58a

<b>which are fit to be sacrificed. From where</b> do I know <b>to include blemished</b> animals in this prohibition? <b>I include blemished</b> animals <b>since</b> they are at least of <b>the type that is fit</b> to be sacrificed. <b>And from where</b> do I know <b>to include the undomesticated animal</b> in this prohibition? <b>I include the undomesticated animal since it</b> is rendered fit for consumption <b>by</b> means of <b>slaughtering, like a domesticated animal. From where</b> do I know <b>to include birds,</b> as the Torah does not mention slaughter with regard to birds, in this prohibition? <b>The verse states: “And he slaughters it,” “and he shall slaughter it,”</b> as well as <b>“and he shall slaughter it,”</b> employing the addition term “it” each time. These three verses teach that one may not eat from a non-sacred animal that was slaughtered in the Temple courtyard
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he may not slaughter</b> a non-sacred animal in the Temple courtyard <i>ab initio</i>, <b>but if he did slaughter</b> it, <b>he may cast it before the dogs,</b> i.e., derive benefit from it. <b>The verse states:</b> “Therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; <b>you shall cast it to the dogs”</b> (Exodus 22:30), which teaches that although one is prohibited from eating the meat of a <i>tereifa</i>, one may derive benefit from it. The word “it” serves to emphasize and exclude: <b>You may cast it,</b> i.e., a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>to the dogs, but you may not cast non-sacred</b> animals <b>that have been slaughtered in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard,</b> as it is prohibited to derive any benefit from them.
The Gemara relates: <b>Mar Yehuda found Rav Yosef and Rav Shmuel, son of Rabba bar bar Ḥana, standing at the entrance of Rabba’s study hall. He said to them:</b> It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with a firstborn donkey, with meat</b> cooked <b>in milk, or with non-sacred</b> animals <b>slaughtered in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard, Rabbi Shimon says she is betrothed, and the Rabbis say she is not betrothed. Apparently, according to Rabbi Shimon,</b> the prohibition against deriving benefit from <b>non-sacred</b> animals <b>slaughtered in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard is not by Torah law,</b> which is why the betrothal takes effect.
<b>And</b> Mar Yehuda <b>raises a contradiction</b> against this inference from a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Non-sacred,</b> domesticated, animals <b>slaughtered in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard</b> must <b>be burned, as well as a</b> non-sacred <b>undomesticated animal slaughtered in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.</b> This indicates that it is prohibited to derive benefit from them. <b>They were silent</b> and had no answer.
<b>They came before Rabba</b> and told him about this difficulty. <b>He said to them: A quarrelsome</b> person <b>has put you up</b> to asking this question. <b>With what are we dealing here</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>? We are dealing with a case <b>where it was slaughtered and found</b> to be <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, and Rabbi Shimon</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning</b> that an act of slaughter which does not render the animal permitted to be eaten is not called slaughter, so the animal does not have the status of a non-sacred animal slaughtered in the Temple courtyard.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ḥullin</i> 2:4): With regard to <b>one who slaughters</b> a known <b><i>tereifa</i>, as well as one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>and it was found</b> to be <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> and <b>this and that</b> were <b>non-sacred</b> animals slaughtered <b>in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard, Rabbi Shimon permits</b> one <b>to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from them, as explained previously. <b>And the Rabbis prohibit</b> one from deriving benefit from them, since they do not distinguish between an act of slaughter that does render the animal permitted to be eaten and one that does not. It is only in a case where the man betrothed her with a <i>tereifa</i> that was slaughtered in the Temple courtyard that Rabbi Shimon says she is betrothed, but not when the animal was not a <i>tereifa</i>.
§ The mishna teaches that if <b>one sold</b> any of the items from which one is prohibited to derive benefit <b>and betrothed</b> a woman <b>with</b> the <b>money</b> received from <b>their</b> sale, <b>she is betrothed.</b> With regard to the possibility of deriving benefit from money received in exchange for items from which benefit is forbidden, the Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that this is permitted? The Gemara answers: It is <b>from</b> the fact that <b>the Merciful One reveals</b> in the Torah <b>with regard to</b> an object of <b>idol worship: “And you shall be banned like it”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:26), which teaches that <b>anything that you</b> cause to <b>come from it,</b> i.e., in exchange for it, <b>is like it.</b> It can be understood <b>by inference that</b> with regard to <b>all</b> the other <b>prohibitions of the Torah,</b> monies received for items from which benefit is forbidden are <b>permitted.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>But let us derive</b> a general principle concerning other prohibitions <b>from</b> the case of idolatry. The Gemara answers: This derivation is not applied, <b>because</b> an object of <b>idol worship and</b> produce of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year <b>are two verses that come as one,</b> i.e., to teach the same matter, since both prohibitions also extend to the money obtained for them, <b>and any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> their common aspect to apply to other cases.
The Gemara clarifies: The source indicating that this is true of an object of <b>idol worship</b> is <b>what we said. What is</b> the source indicating that this <i>halakha</i> applies to produce of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year? The verse states: <b>“It is a Jubilee, it shall be holy to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:12), from which it is derived: <b>Just as consecrated property transfers</b> its sanctity to the <b>money</b> with which <b>it</b> is redeemed, <b>so too,</b> produce of <b>the Sabbatical</b> Year, which has the same status as the Jubilee Year, <b>transfers</b> its sanctity to the <b>money</b> with which it is redeemed. Consequently, money used to acquire the produce of the Sabbatical Year will be subject to the same <i>halakhot</i> as the produce itself.
<b>If</b> so, one could also say that <b>just as</b> with <b>consecrated</b> property, it <b>transfers</b> its sanctity to the <b>money</b> with which <b>it</b> is redeemed <b>and becomes desacralized, so too,</b> produce of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year should <b>transfer</b> its sanctity to the <b>money</b> with which it is redeemed and <b>becomes desacralized.</b> Nevertheless, <b>the verse states: “Shall be,”</b> meaning: <b>As it is,</b> so <b>it shall be,</b> indicating that the Sabbatical-Year produce does not become desacralized.
The Gemara explains: <b>How so?</b> If one <b>purchased meat with produce</b> of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, both <b>these and those,</b> i.e., the meat and the produce, <b>are disposed of in the Sabbatical</b> Year. The sanctity of the Sabbatical Year takes effect with regard to the meat as well. It is treated like the produce, and must be disposed of when the obligation to dispose of the Sabbatical-Year produce goes into effect. If he then purchases <b>fish with</b> this <b>meat,</b> the <b>meat loses</b> its consecrated status, and the <b>fish assumes</b> the consecrated state. If he then purchases <b>wine with</b> these <b>fish,</b> the <b>fish loses</b> its consecrated status and the <b>wine assumes</b> the consecrated state. If he then purchases <b>oil with</b> the <b>wine,</b> the <b>wine loses</b> has its consecrated status and the <b>oil assumes</b> the consecrated state. <b>How so? The final</b> item purchased has the sanctity <b>of</b> the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year <b>transferred</b> to it, <b>and the</b> Sabbatical-Year <b>produce itself</b> remains <b>forbidden.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that any two verses that come as one <b>do not teach</b> their common aspect to apply to other cases. <b>But according to the one who says that they do teach</b> their common aspect to apply to other cases, <b>what can be said?</b> Why is it not learned from these examples that money received from the sale of an item from which benefit is forbidden, is likewise forbidden? The Gemara answers: Expressions of <b>restriction are written</b> in both cases. <b>Here,</b> with regard to idol worship, it <b>is written: “For it is banned”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:26), which indicates only that it is banned, i.e., has its prohibition extend to money received from its sale, while other prohibited items are not. <b>And there,</b> with regard to produce of the Sabbatical Year, it <b>is written: “It is a Jubilee”</b> (Leviticus 25:12), which teaches that with regard to <b>“it,” yes,</b> this <i>halakha</i> applies; but this <i>halakha</i> does <b>not</b> apply to <b>anything else.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with <i>terumot</i>, or with tithes, or with</b> the foreleg, cheeks, and stomach of an animal, which are given as <b>gifts</b> to priests, <b>or with the water of purification,</b> which is sprinkled on an impure person during the purification rite for impurity imparted by a corpse, <b>or with the ashes of purification,</b> which were mixed with the water sprinkled on an impure person during the purification rite for impurity imparted by a corpse, in all of these cases <b>she is betrothed, and</b> this is so <b>even if</b> the man betrothing her is <b>an Israelite,</b> not a priest or a Levite.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Ulla says:</b> The <b>benefit of discretion,</b> i.e., the benefit accrued from the option of giving <i>teruma</i> and tithes to whichever priest or Levite one chooses, <b>does not have monetary</b> value. <b>Rabbi Abba raised an objection to Ulla</b> from the mishna: With regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with <i>terumot</i>, or with tithes, or with gifts, with the water of purification, or with the ashes</b> of the red <b>heifer, she is betrothed, and</b> this is so <b>even if</b> the man betrothing her is <b>an Israelite.</b> This indicates that although an Israelite cannot consume the priestly gifts, he may nevertheless betroth a woman with them, since he possesses the option to give them to the priest or Levite of his choice. That benefit has monetary value, and it is that value that he uses to betroth a woman, who can then give them to whichever priest or Levite she chooses.
Ulla <b>said to him:</b> You have misunderstood the case of the mishna, since <b>here</b> the case is <b>with an Israelite who came into</b> possession of <b>untithed produce</b> as an inheritance <b>from the household of his mother’s father,</b> who was <b>a priest, and</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>holds</b> that <b>gifts that have not been separated are considered as though they have been separated.</b> The untithed produce is not viewed as one entity, but rather is viewed as a mixture of regular produce, <i>teruma</i>, and tithes. This <i>teruma</i> belonged to his grandfather, who was a priest. Since he has inherited this <i>teruma</i>, he has ownership rights to it in addition to the benefit of discretion. While he cannot consume this produce because he is an Israelite, he can sell it to a priest and keep the money. Since it has actual value, it can be used to betroth a woman.
With regard to this issue, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin inquired of Rav Huna:</b> Does the <b>benefit of discretion have monetary</b> value, <b>or does it not have monetary</b> value? Rav Huna <b>said to him: You learned it</b> in the mishna: With regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with <i>terumot</i>, or with tithes, or with gifts,</b> or <b>with the water of purification, or with the ashes</b> of the red <b>heifer, she is betrothed, and</b> this is so <b>even if</b> the man betrothing her is <b>an Israelite.</b> This indicates that the benefit of discretion has monetary value. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin <b>said to him: But didn’t we establish it,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Ulla, as referring <b>to an Israelite who came into</b> possession of <b>untithed produce</b> as an inheritance <b>from the household of his mother’s father,</b> who was <b>a priest?</b>

Daf 58b

Rav Huna <b>said to him: You are out [<i>hotza’a</i>].</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin <b>was embarrassed,</b> as <b>he thought</b> Rav Huna <b>told him</b> he was out, i.e., wrong, <b>due to</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> he</b> stated. Sensing Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin’s embarrassment, Rav Huna <b>said to him: This is what I said:</b> You are a <i>Hutzla’a</i>, as <b>Rav Asi, from</b> the town of <b>Huzal, stands in accordance with your</b> opinion.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that it is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> The <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 3:9) taught: <b>One who steals another’s untithed produce pays him the</b> full <b>value of the other’s untithed produce;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: He pays only the value of the non-sacred</b> produce <b>that it contains. What, is it not</b> the case <b>that they disagree about this</b> issue: <b>That</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds</b> that the <b>benefit of discretion has monetary</b> value, so he must be compensated beyond the value of the non-sacred produce; <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that the <b>benefit of discretion does not have monetary</b> value, and only the non-sacred produce is of value to the owner.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>No, everyone agrees</b> that the <b>benefit of discretion does not have monetary</b> value, <b>and here</b> the case is <b>with an Israelite who came into</b> possession of <b>untithed produce</b> as an inheritance <b>from the household of his mother’s father,</b> who was <b>a priest. And they disagree with regard to</b> the question of whether or not <b>gifts that have not been separated are considered as though they have been separated.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds</b> that they <b>are considered as though they have been separated,</b> which means that the grandson inherited the <i>teruma</i> itself from his grandfather, so the thief must repay him the value of the <i>terumot</i> and tithes as well. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that such gifts <b>are not considered as though they have been separated;</b> and the produce is viewed as regular untithed produce, where the Israelite has only the benefit of discretion, which is of no monetary value.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>everyone agrees</b> that the gifts <b>are considered as though they have been separated, and</b> that the <b>benefit of discretion does not have monetary</b> value. The case is not concerning an Israelite who came into possession of untithed produce as an inheritance from the household of his mother’s father; rather, it is concerning regular untithed produce, <b>and here</b> they <b>disagree with regard to</b> a statement <b>of Shmuel. As Shmuel says:</b> By Torah law, even <b>one grain</b> given as <i>teruma</i> <b>exempts the</b> entire <b>heap,</b> since the Torah does not specify a minimum amount for <i>teruma</i>.
<b>As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Shmuel,</b> so the thief must pay the value of the untithed produce as well, since the owner can say that he would separate a single grain as <i>teruma</i> for the entire heap and the rest would remain non-sacred produce. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, <b>is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Shmuel,</b> which means that when the owner makes his claim he must subtract at least one-sixtieth of the total amount as <i>teruma</i>.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>everyone is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Shmuel; and here, this is</b> the <b>reasoning of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: Although the benefit of discretion does not have monetary value, and by right should not lead to reimbursement, <b>the Sages penalized the thief.</b> If he did not need to pay for the <i>teruma</i> contained in the produce, he would have been able to keep it, as no priest has the legal ability to demand that the <i>teruma</i> be given specifically to him.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>everyone is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Shmuel, and here, this is</b> the <b>reasoning of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda: The Sages penalized the owner, since he should not have left his untithed produce</b> in that state, and should have separated <i>teruma</i> without delay.
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna: With regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with <i>terumot</i>, or with tithes, or with</b> the <b>gifts</b> given to priests, or <b>with the water of purification, or with the ashes</b> of the red <b>heifer,</b> in all of these cases <b>she is betrothed, and</b> this is so <b>even if</b> the man betrothing her is <b>an Israelite. And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to this from the following <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bekhorot</i> 3:5): With regard to <b>one who accepts payment to judge, his judgments are nullified.</b> Similarly, with regard to one who accepts payment <b>to testify, his testimony is nullified.</b> With regard to one who accepts payment <b>to sprinkle</b> the purification water on one who was impure from impurity imparted by a corpse, <b>or to sanctify</b> the purification water by placing the ashes of the red heifer in them, <b>his water</b> is considered <b>cave water,</b> which is generally foul, <b>and his ashes are burnt ashes.</b> Using these items to betroth a woman is analogous to being paid for them, so they should be considered as having no monetary value, and the betrothal should not take effect.
<b>Abaye said:</b> This is <b>not difficult,</b> since <b>here,</b> the mishna is referring to one who betroths a woman <b>with</b> the value of the <b>payment for bringing and filling</b> the vessel with the purification waters, for which one is permitted to accept payment. Performing this act for the woman is comparable to giving her an item of value, since she will not have to pay someone to bring and fill the vessel for her. <b>There,</b> the <i>baraita</i> dealing with one who accepts payment for sprinkling or sanctifying the water is referring <b>to payment for</b> the actual <b>sprinkling and sanctifying.</b>
The Gemara comments: According to this answer, the language of the mishna and the <i>baraita</i> <b>is also precise, as it teaches here,</b> in the mishna, that she is betrothed <b>with the water of purification or with the ashes of purification,</b> which indicates that the water and ashes have not yet been mixed together; <b>and it teaches there,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>To sprinkle or to sanctify,</b> indicating that he receives payment for the actual sprinkling and sanctification. The Gemara affirms: <b>Learn from it</b> that this is the correct explanation of the mishna and the <i>baraita</i>.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one</b> man <b>who says to another: Go and betroth so-and-so to me, and</b> the latter <b>went and betrothed her to himself, she is betrothed to the second</b> man. <b>And similarly,</b> with regard to <b>one who says to a woman: You are hereby betrothed to me after thirty days, and another</b> man <b>came and betrothed her within</b> those <b>thirty days, she is betrothed to the second</b> man. This is a full-fledged betrothal, so that if she is <b>an Israelite woman</b> betrothed <b>to a priest, she may partake of <i>teruma</i>.</b>
If the first man said to the woman: You are hereby betrothed to me <b>from now, and</b> only <b>after thirty days</b> shall the betrothal take effect, <b>and another</b> man <b>came and betrothed her within</b> those <b>thirty days,</b> there is uncertainty whether <b>she is betrothed or</b> whether <b>she is not betrothed</b> to each of them. Consequently, if she was <b>the daughter of a non-priest</b> betrothed <b>to a priest, or the daughter of a priest</b> betrothed <b>to an Israelite, she may not partake of <i>teruma</i>.</b> Since her betrothal is uncertain, the daughter of a non-priest cannot be considered the wife of a priest, and similarly a priest’s daughter who is doubtfully married to an Israelite loses her right to partake of <i>teruma</i> as the daughter of a priest.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that in the case of <b>one</b> man <b>who says to another: Go and betroth</b> so-and-so to me, and the latter went and betrothed her to himself, she is betrothed to the second man. A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> concerning this issue: <b>What he did is done;</b> it is effective and the woman is betrothed to the second man, <b>but he has treated him,</b> i.e., the first man, <b>in a deceitful manner,</b> and it is prohibited to act in this fashion. The Gemara explains: <b>And the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna, <b>when</b> he <b>teaches</b> the apparently superfluous term: <b>Went, also</b> indicates that he <b>went</b> and acted <b>deceitfully.</b>
§ The Gemara asks a question concerning the language of the mishna: <b>What is different here that</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> With regard to <b>one</b> man <b>who says to another,</b>

Daf 59a

<b>and what is different there,</b> in the previous chapter (50a), <b>that</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches:</b> With regard to <b>one who says to his agent,</b> go and betroth a certain woman for me in such and such a place, and he went and betrothed her in a different place, she is not betrothed? Why does the mishna there label him an agent, and here it labels him simply another?
The Gemara answers: <b>Here</b> the mishna <b>teaches us a novel</b> element <b>and there</b> it <b>teaches us a novel</b> element, through its use of these terms. The Gemara elaborates: The mishna <b>here teaches us a novel</b> element, <b>as had it taught: His agent, I would say</b> that <b>it is his agent who is</b> considered <b>a scoundrel</b> in that case, <b>as</b> one who sends an agent <b>relies</b> upon him, <b>thinking:</b> He will <b>perform my agency for me,</b> since he was sent for that purpose. <b>But</b> with regard to the use of the term: <b>Another,</b> who was not appointed and <b>upon whom he does not rely,</b> as he is not his agent, you might <b>say</b> that he <b>should not</b> be considered <b>a scoundrel.</b>
Similarly, the mishna <b>there teaches us a novel</b> element, <b>as had it taught: One who says to another, I would say</b> that <b>it is</b> in the case of <b>another that she is not betrothed if he betrothed her in a different place, as he thinks</b> that this person would <b>not</b> go to the <b>trouble</b> of looking for her elsewhere, and therefore he authorized him to betroth the woman only in that particular place. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>his agent, who</b> is assumed to take special <b>trouble</b> to fulfill his agency, you might <b>say he is</b> merely <b>showing him</b> the <b>place</b> where she is likely to be found, and she is betrothed in any case. The mishna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that even when he appointed an agent she is not betrothed if he does not find her in the place the putative husband specified.
The Gemara relates: <b>Ravin the Pious</b> was appointed an agent and <b>went to betroth a woman to his son,</b> but in the end he <b>betrothed her to himself.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>: <b>What he did is done, but he has treated him in a deceitful manner?</b> How could a pious individual act in this fashion? The Gemara answers: The woman’s family <b>would not give her to</b> the son, and agreed only to let her marry the father. The Gemara further asks: Even so, before betrothing her <b>he should have</b> first <b>informed</b> his son that they refuse to let her marry him. The Gemara explains that Ravin <b>thought: In the meantime,</b> while I am busy reporting back to my son, <b>someone else</b> will <b>come</b> and <b>betroth her.</b>
The Gemara relates a similar story: <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana gave money to Rav</b> and <b>said: Purchase this land for me.</b> Rav <b>went and purchased it for himself.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> with regard to an agent who acts in this manner: <b>What he did is done, but he has treated him in a deceitful manner?</b> The Gemara answers: The land <b>was</b> located <b>in a valley</b> inhabited <b>by violent</b> men, who <b>treated Rav</b> with <b>respect</b> and were prepared to sell the land to him, but who <b>did not treat Rabba bar bar Ḥana</b> with <b>respect.</b> As in the case of Ravin, the Gemara questions this behavior: Nevertheless, Rav <b>should have informed him.</b> The Gemara responds that Rav <b>thought: In the meantime someone else will come</b> and <b>purchase</b> the land.
The Gemara further relates: <b>Rav Giddel was engaging in</b> the acquisition of <b>a certain</b> plot of <b>land.</b> In the meantime <b>Rabbi Abba went</b> and <b>purchased it. Rav Giddel went</b> and <b>complained about</b> Rabbi Abba <b>to Rabbi Zeira. Rabbi Zeira went and complained about</b> Rabbi Abba <b>to Rav Yitzḥak Nappaḥa.</b> Rav Yitzḥak Nappaḥa <b>said to him: Wait until</b> Rabbi Abba <b>ascends to</b> visit <b>us for the pilgrimage Festival,</b> when all come to hear the Festival sermon, on which occasion we can discuss this matter with him. <b>When</b> Rabbi Abba <b>ascended</b> Rav Yitzḥak Nappaḥa <b>found him</b> and <b>said to him:</b> If <b>a pauper is engaging in</b> the acquisition of <b>a loaf</b> of bread that he found, <b>and another came and took it from him, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>?
Rabbi Abba <b>said to him:</b> The one who took it away <b>is called wicked.</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa replied: <b>But</b> if so, <b>what is the reason</b> that <b>the Master acted this way?</b> Rav Giddel was negotiating the purchase of this land and you purchased it. Rabbi Abba <b>said to him: I did not know</b> that Rav Giddel was trying to acquire the land. Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa retorted: <b>Now too, the Master should give it to him,</b> since you have been made aware that he submitted the first offer. Rabbi Abba <b>said to him:</b> As for <b>selling, I will not sell it, as it is</b> the <b>first land</b> I have ever purchased, <b>and</b> this <b>matter</b> of selling one’s first acquisition <b>is not</b> a good <b>omen. If he wants</b> to accept it <b>as a gift, let him take it.</b>
<b>Rav Giddel did not descend to</b> claim this plot of land, <b>as it is written: “But he who hates gifts shall live”</b> (Proverbs 15:27), and therefore he did not wish to accept the land as a gift. <b>Rabbi Abba</b> also <b>did not descend to it, because Rav Giddel</b> was already <b>engaging in</b> the acquisition of <b>it</b> when he acquired the land. In this manner, <b>this Sage did not descend to</b> take the plot of land, <b>and that Sage did not descend to</b> take care of <b>it, and it was called the land of the Sages.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And similarly,</b> with regard to <b>one who says to a woman: Be betrothed to me</b> after thirty days, and another came and betrothed her within this period, she is betrothed to the second man. The Gemara asks: In a case where <b>another did not come and betroth her within</b> the <b>thirty</b> days, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav and Shmuel both say: She is betrothed</b> after thirty days, <b>even if the money</b> he gave for her betrothal <b>has been used</b> before the end of this period, as the betrothal takes effect from when the money is given.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is the reason</b> that she is betrothed despite the lack of money at the end of the thirty days? The Gemara explains that <b>these dinars</b> given for her betrothal are <b>not comparable to a loan, nor</b> are they <b>comparable to a deposit</b> that was transferred into her possession and subsequently lost. In both of these cases she would not be betrothed.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>They are not comparable to a deposit,</b> as <b>a deposit is used in its owner’s possession,</b> i.e., any loss is incurred by the owner, <b>whereas these are used in her own possession,</b> as he gave her the money to keep. These dinars <b>are also not comparable to a loan; a loan is given for spending</b> and therefore no money remains at the time of the betrothal, whereas <b>these</b> dinars <b>were given to her</b> from the outset <b>for the purpose of betrothal.</b>
The Gemara asks: If <b>another did not come and betroth her, and she retracted her</b> consent to the betrothal within thirty days, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: She can retract</b> her consent. Why? This <b>statement,</b> by which she changes her mind, <b>comes and nullifies</b> her previous <b>statement</b> when she agreed to the betrothal. <b>Reish Lakish said: She cannot retract</b> her consent, as her second <b>statement does not come and nullify</b> her previous <b>statement.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish</b> from a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 3:4): In a case where someone appointed an agent to separate <i>teruma</i> from his produce on his behalf, and he subsequently <b>canceled</b> the agency, the <i>halakha</i> depends on the following: <b>If he canceled</b> the appointment <b>before</b> the agent <b>separated the <i>teruma</i>, his <i>teruma</i> is not <i>teruma</i>. And here it is</b> a case involving one <b>statement and</b> a second <b>statement,</b> as the owner of the produce appointed the agent and rescinded his appointment by speech. This shows that <b>a statement comes and nullifies</b> a previous <b>statement.</b> Reish Lakish replied: <b>Giving money to a woman is different, as it is considered like an action, and</b> a mere <b>statement does not come and nullify</b> the <b>action</b> of the transfer of money.
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raised</b> a further <b>objection</b> to Reish Lakish: With regard to <b>one who sends a bill of divorce to his wife, and</b> later the husband <b>encountered the agent or sent</b> another <b>agent after him and</b> in this manner <b>said to him: The bill of divorce that I gave you is nullified, it is thereby nullified. And giving a bill of divorce to an agent is considered</b> to be <b>like giving money to a woman, and</b> yet this <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that <b>it is nullified,</b> which indicates that speech can override even an action.
Reish Lakish answered: <b>There too, as long as the bill of divorce has not reached the woman’s hand it is</b> considered a case of one <b>statement and</b> a second <b>statement.</b> There is no halakhic significance to the transmitting of a bill of divorce to an agent, as only its delivery to the wife is considered an action. Therefore, the act of transferring the bill of divorce to the agent is of no consequence and in this particular case <b>a statement comes and nullifies</b> a previous <b>statement.</b>
<b>Reish Lakish raised an objection to Rabbi Yoḥanan: All vessels descend into their</b> state of contracting <b>ritual impurity by means of thought.</b> Although an unfinished vessel cannot become ritually impure, if the craftsman decided not to work on it any further, it immediately assumes the status of a completed vessel and can become ritually impure. <b>But they ascend from their</b> state of <b>ritual impurity only by means of a change</b> resulting from <b>an action.</b> A ritually impure vessel, once it undergoes physical change, is no longer ritually impure.

Daf 59b

<b>An action</b> undertaken to improve the vessel <b>negates</b> both the status created by an earlier <b>action</b> that supposedly completed the vessel <b>and</b> the status created by the <b>thought</b> not to perform more work on the vessel. In that case the vessel cannot contract ritual impurity until the craftsman has finished working on it. By contrast, <b>a thought</b> to improve the vessel <b>negates neither</b> status created by <b>action nor</b> status created by <b>thought.</b> Reish Lakish finds this difficult for the following reason: <b>Granted,</b> thought <b>does not negate action, as a statement does not come and nullify action. But it should at least offset thought.</b> This <i>halakha</i> indicates that a statement does not nullify a previous statement.
The Gemara answers: <b>Thought</b> in the case <b>of ritual impurity is different, as</b> it <b>is considered like action, and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Pappa. As Rav Pappa raises a contradiction:</b> With regard to the <i>halakha</i> that produce must become wet in order for it to contract ritual impurity, the verse states: “But if water is placed [<i>vekhi yuttan</i>] upon the seed, and any part of a carcass falls upon it, it is impure” (Leviticus 11:38). The word <i>yuttan</i> is written defective, and <b>is written</b> as if it says <b><i>ki yitten</i>.</b> Accordingly, this would mean that one must actively place the water on the produce. Yet <b>we read</b> it, based on the tradition as to its correct pronunciation, <b>“<i>ki yuttan</i>,”</b> which includes any situation where the produce becomes wet. <b>How so?</b> How can the way the verse is written and the way it is read be reconciled?
Rav Pappa explains that the standard of <b>“if water is placed [<i>ki yuttan</i>]”</b> is <b>similar to: If one places [<i>ki yitten</i>]; just as</b> the term <b>places [<i>yitten</i>]</b> indicates <b>that</b> it is <b>satisfactory to</b> the owner for the produce to become wet, as he himself is placing the water, <b>so too,</b> the term <b>“is placed [<i>yuttan</i>]”</b> means <b>that</b> it is <b>satisfactory to</b> the owner that the produce becomes wet, despite the fact that he did not place the water himself. This is proof that thought is equivalent to action with regard to ritual impurity, as if one is satisfied with the produce becoming wet it is considered as though he actively placed the water himself. By the same reasoning, thought which renders a vessel susceptible to ritual impurity is powerful enough to require an action to counteract its effect.
The Gemara presents another version of the discussion: <b>Rav Zevid taught this</b> dispute <b>with regard to this</b> <i>halakha</i>: <b>And similarly,</b> in a case <b>where she gave permission to her agent to accept betrothal for her and she</b> subsequently <b>went and accepted betrothal herself</b> from someone else, <b>if her</b> betrothal <b>came first, her betrothal is</b> a valid <b>betrothal, but if</b> the betrothal <b>of her agent came first, her betrothal is not a betrothal.</b>
The Sages discuss this <i>halakha</i>: If she did <b>not accept betrothal herself and retracted</b> her appointment of the agent, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: She can retract</b> her appointment; <b>and Reish Lakish says: She cannot retract</b> her appointment. The Gemara clarifies their respective opinions. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: She can retract</b> her appointment, as <b>a statement comes and nullifies</b> a previous <b>statement,</b> by which she appointed the agent. <b>Reish Lakish said: She cannot retract</b> her appointment, as <b>a statement does not come and nullify</b> a previous <b>statement.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish</b> from the aforementioned mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 3:4) with regard to one who appointed an agent to separate <i>teruma</i> on his behalf and subsequently <b>canceled</b> the agency: <b>If he canceled</b> the appointment <b>before</b> the agent <b>separated <i>teruma</i>, his <i>teruma</i> is not <i>teruma</i>.</b> This shows that a statement nullifies a previous statement. <b>Rava says: With what are we dealing here?</b> With a case <b>where the homeowner preceded</b> the agent <b>and separated <i>teruma</i></b> from <b>his heap</b> himself, <b>which is an action,</b> and an action certainly nullifies a statement.
<b>Reish Lakish raised an objection to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>All vessels descend into their</b> state of contracting <b>ritual impurity by means of thought. But they ascend from their</b> state of <b>ritual impurity only by means of a change</b> resulting from <b>an action. An action</b> undertaken to improve the vessel <b>negates</b> both the status created by an earlier <b>action</b> that supposedly completed the vessel <b>and</b> the status created by the <b>thought</b> not to perform more work on the vessel. By contrast, <b>a thought</b> to improve the vessel <b>negates neither</b> status created by <b>action nor</b> status created by <b>thought.</b> Reish Lakish explains his objection: <b>Granted,</b> thought <b>does not negate action,</b> as <b>a statement does not come and nullify action. But it should at least offset thought.</b>
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Reish Lakish: <b>Thought</b> in the case <b>of ritual impurity is different, as</b> it <b>is considered like action, and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Pappa. As Rav Pappa raises a contradiction:</b> The word <i>yuttan</i> is written defective, and <b>is written</b> as if it says <b><i>ki yitten</i>.</b> Yet <b>we read</b> it <b>“<i>ki yuttan</i>.” How so?</b> The standard of <b>“if water is placed [<i>ki yuttan</i>]”</b> is <b>similar to: If one places [<i>ki yitten</i>]; just as</b> the term <b>places [<i>yitten</i>]</b> indicates <b>that</b> it is <b>satisfactory to</b> the owner for the produce to become wet, as he himself is placing the water, <b>so too,</b> the term <b>“is placed [<i>yuttan</i>]”</b> means <b>that</b> it is <b>satisfactory to</b> the owner that the produce becomes wet, despite the fact that he did not place the water himself.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish:</b> With regard to <b>one who sends a bill of divorce to his wife, and</b> later the husband <b>encountered the agent or sent</b> another <b>agent after him and</b> in this manner <b>said to him: The bill of divorce that I gave you is nullified, it is thereby nullified.</b> This indicates that the appointment of an agent can be nullified even by a statement. The Gemara concludes: <b>The refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish is</b> in fact <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>
The Gemara adds: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan, and</b> this is <b>even according to the first</b> version of their dispute, with regard to a woman who retracts from her betrothal after accepting the money for it. <b>And even though there is</b> room <b>to say</b> that <b>giving money to a woman</b> for betrothal <b>is different, as it is considered like an action, even so, a statement comes and nullifies</b> a previous <b>statement</b> with regard to her consent to the betrothal, provided that the betrothal has yet to take effect.
The Gemara asks: <b>The <i>halakha</i></b> recorded here is <b>difficult</b> with regard to <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> recorded elsewhere. <b>You said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, and</b> yet <b>we maintain</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman. As a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of a bill of divorce sent by an agent that the husband nullified before it was received by his wife? Can the husband <b>return and divorce</b> his wife <b>with</b> the very same bill of divorce?
<b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> He <b>can return and divorce</b> her <b>with it,</b> and <b>Rav Sheshet says: He cannot return and divorce</b> her <b>with it. And we maintain</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Naḥman</b> in this case. By contrast, according to the ruling of Rabbi Yoḥanan, since the husband has nullified the bill of divorce it should no longer be valid. The Gemara answers: This is not difficult, as, <b>although</b> the husband <b>has nullified</b> the agent <b>from his status as an agent, he has not nullified</b> the bill of divorce itself <b>from its status as a bill of divorce.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that if a man betroths a woman and stipulates that the betrothal will take effect in thirty days’ time and another man betroths her within that period, <b>she is betrothed to the second</b> man. <b>Rav says: She is betrothed to the second forever,</b> i.e., the betrothal is fully effective, <b>and Shmuel says: She is betrothed to the second until</b> the <b>thirty days</b> pass. <b>After thirty days</b> have passed, <b>the betrothal of the second lapses, and the</b> earlier <b>betrothal of the first</b> man <b>is completed.</b>
<b>Rav Ḥisda sat and</b> found this <b>difficult: By what</b> means is the <b>betrothal of the second</b> man <b>abrogated?</b> When the second betrothal took effect, the first betrothal was not yet in effect. Why, then, is the second betrothal abrogated? <b>Rav Yosef said to him: The Master teaches</b> this dispute <b>with regard to the first clause</b> of the mishna, <b>and</b> therefore <b>he</b> finds it <b>difficult,</b> whereas <b>Rav Yehuda teaches</b> it with regard <b>to the latter clause</b> of the mishna, <b>and</b> consequently <b>he does not</b> find it <b>difficult.</b>
Rav Yehuda’s version of the dispute is as follows: The mishna teaches that if the first man says to her: You are hereby betrothed to me <b>from now and after thirty days,</b> and another man betrothed her within those thirty days, there is uncertainty whether she is betrothed or whether she is not betrothed. <b>Rav says:</b> This means that there is uncertainty whether <b>she is betrothed or</b> whether <b>she is not betrothed forever,</b> and her only option is to receive a bill of divorce from both men. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> There is uncertainty whether <b>she is betrothed or</b> whether <b>she is not betrothed only until thirty days</b> have elapsed, whereas <b>after thirty</b> days <b>the betrothal of the second</b> is <b>abrogated, and the betrothal of the first is completed.</b>
The Gemara explains their respective opinions: <b>Rav is uncertain</b> what the first man meant. <b>Is it a condition,</b> i.e., the man is saying: If I do not change my mind within thirty days, you are betrothed to me from now, or <b>is it a retraction,</b> that is, he immediately retracted after he said: From now, in favor of a betrothal that will take effect only after thirty days have elapsed. This uncertainty remains even after the end of the thirty days. <b>It is obvious to Shmuel that it is a condition.</b> Consequently, the uncertainty whether or not she is betrothed to the second man applies during the thirty-day period, as the first man might yet change his mind. After the completion of thirty days, the betrothal from the first man retroactively takes effect from the moment he gave it, and therefore the betrothal of the second man is abrogated.
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> Rav and Shmuel disagree <b>in the dispute between these <i>tanna’im</i>. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one says to his wife upon giving her a bill of divorce that it should take effect: <b>From today and after</b> my <b>death,</b> there is uncertainty whether it <b>is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce or</b> whether it <b>is not a</b> valid <b>bill of divorce.</b> This is <b>the statement of the Rabbis.</b> The Rabbis are uncertain whether he meant that the bill of divorce should take effect retroactively from that moment, in which case it is valid; or whether he changed his mind and meant for it to take effect only after his death, which would mean that it is not a valid bill of divorce. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> A document <b>like this</b> is a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b> The husband meant his statement as a condition that the bill of divorce should, after his death, take effect retroactively from now, and therefore it is a valid bill of divorce.
The Gemara asks: <b>And let Rav,</b> instead of explaining his own opinion, <b>say</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and let Shmuel say</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. The Gemara answers: It is <b>necessary</b> for Rav and Shmuel to state their disagreement explicitly. <b>As had Rav</b> merely <b>said</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, I would say: There,</b> in the case of a bill of divorce, <b>when he comes to distance her</b> from himself, one can say that he has changed his mind with regard to the divorce. <b>But here,</b> in the case of betrothal, <b>when he comes to draw her near,</b> you might <b>say</b> that Rav <b>concedes to Shmuel that it is</b> certainly <b>a condition,</b> as he wants to betroth her as soon as possible.
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>had Shmuel said</b> only that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>I would say: It is</b> in that case <b>there</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said it is a valid bill of divorce, <b>as there is no bill of divorce after death,</b> and therefore it is unlikely that he changed his mind and attempted to give a bill of divorce that will take effect only after the death of the husband. <b>But here, where there is</b> the possibility of <b>betrothal after thirty</b> days, and he might well have intended to retract the betrothal, you might <b>say</b> that <b>Shmuel concedes to Rav.</b> Consequently, it was <b>necessary</b> to state the dispute between Rav and Shmuel concerning betrothal in explicit terms.
<b>Abaye said: And according to the reasoning of Rav,</b> if <b>one</b> man <b>came and said</b> the following ambiguous statement <b>to her: You are hereby betrothed to me from now and after thirty days. And another</b> man <b>came</b> during these thirty days <b>and said to her: You are hereby betrothed to me from now and after twenty days,</b>

Daf 60a

<b>and another</b> man <b>came and said to her: You are hereby betrothed to me from now and after ten days, she requires a bill of divorce from the first</b> man <b>and last</b> man, but <b>she does not require a bill of divorce from the middle one.</b>
Abaye explains: This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>whichever way you</b> look at this case: <b>If</b> this expression <b>is a condition</b> that she should be betrothed from now if he does not retract within thirty days, the betrothal <b>of the first</b> man is <b>a betrothal, whereas</b> the betrothals <b>of those</b> other men are <b>not betrothals. If it is a retraction,</b> i.e., if after saying: From now, he changed his mind and delayed the moment of betrothal, then only that betrothal <b>of the last</b> one is <b>a betrothal, whereas</b> the betrothals <b>of those</b> first two men are <b>not betrothals,</b> as they both postponed their betrothals to a later date. Either way, the betrothal of the middle man is of no consequence.
The Gemara asks: It is <b>obvious</b> that this is the case; what is the novelty of Abaye’s statement? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>this formulation means a condition and</b> also <b>means a retraction, and</b> therefore she should <b>require a bill of divorce from each and every one of them,</b> including the middle man, due to the uncertainty. It is possible the first man retracted while the second one imposed a condition, in which case only the betrothal of the second person takes effect. Abaye therefore <b>teaches us</b> that according to the opinion of Rav, the uncertainty concerns the meaning of this expression itself, and there is no uncertainty with regard to the intention of each individual person who says this formula. Consequently, there is no possibility that this woman is betrothed to the middle man.
<b>Ulla</b> says that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Even</b> if <b>one hundred</b> betrothed her in this manner, their betrothal <b>is effective with regard to her. And similarly, Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Even</b> the betrothal of <b>one hundred is effective with regard to her. Rav Mesharshiyya, son of Rav Ami, said to Rabbi Asi: I will explain to you the reason of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> These one hundred men <b>have rendered themselves like a row [<i>sheraga</i>] of bricks, each and every one</b> of whom <b>leaves a gap for the other.</b> Since there is a period of time before the betrothal of each man takes effect, another betrothal can intervene in the meantime.
<b>Rav Ḥanina raises an objection</b> to this ruling from a <i>baraita</i>: If one says to his wife: This is your bill of divorce <b>from today and after</b> my <b>death,</b> there is uncertainty whether it is a valid <b>bill of divorce or</b> whether it is <b>not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce. And</b> therefore <b>if he dies she performs <i>ḥalitza</i>, but does not enter into levirate marriage.</b> Since she might not be divorced, the obligation of levirate marriage applies to her, but in practice she cannot perform levirate marriage in case she was in fact divorced and is thereby forbidden to her late husband’s brother, a transgression which is punishable by <i>karet</i>.
Rav Ḥanina explains his objection: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>supports him,</b> as Rav maintains that the meaning of this expression is uncertain. <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel as well,</b> although he claims that the phrase is a condition rather than a retraction, he can explain as follows: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who claim in that case that it is uncertain if she is divorced, <b>and I,</b> Shmuel, <b>say</b> my ruling <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
<b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said</b> that this <b>is</b> a phrase that <b>leaves</b> room for additional betrothals, in a case where he uses this phrase with regard to a bill of divorce, this should not be the <i>halakha</i>, as there is a principle: <b>Any bill of divorce that leaves</b> a remnant of the marital bond <b>is not</b> worth <b>anything,</b> as a bill of divorce must completely sever the marital bond between the husband and the wife. If this bond is not fully severed, she is not divorced. Therefore, her late husband’s brother should be allowed to <b>enter into levirate marriage</b> with her.
<b>Rava said:</b> Since <b>a bill of divorce</b> serves <b>to remove</b> a wife from her husband, <b>and death</b> also serves <b>to remove</b> her and dissolve their marital ties, permitting the woman to remarry, one can say that <b>whatever part is left</b> over from that <b>bill of divorce</b> is nevertheless <b>completed by death,</b> and therefore there is a complete act of severance. <b>Abaye said to him: Are</b> the two <b>comparable;</b> can these stages be viewed as completing one another? <b>A bill of divorce removes her</b> not only from her husband’s authority but also <b>from the authority of the <i>yavam</i>,</b> as a divorced woman does not perform levirate marriage, whereas <b>death brings her into the authority of the <i>yavam</i>,</b> because it renders her obligated in levirate marriage.
<b>Rather, Abaye said:</b> One must reject the above explanation, and ask <b>what is the reason there</b> for the concern about that bill of divorce, according to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan? It is not because the bill of divorce is in any way valid. Rather, it is a rabbinic <b>decree due to</b> the case of one who says to his wife: This is hereby your bill of divorce <b>from today if I die.</b> Everyone agrees that <b>this is a bill of divorce</b> that goes into effect from that day if he dies. Since one might confuse the two cases, the Sages decreed that if one says: This is hereby your bill of divorce from today and after my death, the bill of divorce is considered valid to the extent that the woman does not enter into levirate marriage.
The Gemara asks: <b>But let us</b> also issue <b>a decree</b> in a case where he said: This is hereby your bill of divorce <b>from today if I die,</b> that <b>she should perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, due to</b> its similarity to a bill of divorce that includes the stipulation: This is hereby your bill of divorce <b>from today and after</b> my <b>death.</b> The Gemara answers: The Sages do not require her to perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>as, if you say</b> that <b>she performs <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> people will mistakenly think that the <i>yavam</i> performed <i>ḥalitza</i> because he did not want to marry her, and if he had wanted to <b>she</b> could have <b>entered into levirate marriage.</b> In fact, she is divorced and is forbidden to the <i>yavam</i>, and a decree of this kind could mislead people and result in a later transgression.
The Gemara asks: <b>Here too,</b> in the case of where he says: This is hereby your bill of divorce from today and after my death, <b>if you say</b> that <b>she performs <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> people will mistakenly say that <b>she</b> could have <b>entered into levirate marriage.</b> The Gemara answers: This concern is not important, as <b>let her perform levirate marriage and</b> there is <b>no</b> problem <b>with that.</b> The fact that she is treated as a divorcée and is forbidden to the brother-in-law <b>is</b> merely <b>a concern of the Sages,</b> who enacted a decree due to the similarity of the case where one says: This is hereby your bill of divorce from today if I die, whereas it is in fact not a bill of divorce and it is permitted for her to enter into levirate marriage.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who says to a woman: You are hereby betrothed to me</b> with this <i>peruta</i> <b>on the condition that I will give you two hundred dinars, she is betrothed</b> immediately <b>and he shall give</b> her the money. If he said to her that the betrothal is: <b>On the condition that I will give you</b> a particular sum of money <b>from now and until thirty days,</b> if <b>he gave</b> the money <b>to her within thirty</b> days <b>she is betrothed, but if not, she is not betrothed.</b>
If he said to her that the betrothal is: <b>On the condition that I have two hundred dinars, she is betrothed if he has</b> this sum. If he said to her that the betrothal is: <b>On the condition that I will show you two hundred dinars, she is betrothed, and he shall show</b> the money <b>to her. And if</b> he is a moneychanger and <b>shows</b> her money belonging to others <b>on the</b> moneychangers’ <b>table, she is not betrothed,</b> as his statement means that he will show her money of his own.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to the text of this mishna: <b>Rav Huna says</b> that it reads: <b>And he shall give,</b> i.e., it is a valid betrothal from the outset, and the man is obligated to give her the promised amount. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that the correct version of the mishna is: <b>When he gives,</b> meaning that the betrothal takes effect only when he actually gives her the money. The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rav Huna says</b> that the phrase: <b>And he shall give,</b> indicates that this <b>is a condition</b> stipulated by the man, which means that the woman is immediately betrothed and he merely <b>proceeds to fulfill the condition. Rav Yehuda says</b> that the mishna reads: <b>When he gives,</b> which indicates that <b>when he will give</b> the money it <b>will be a betrothal,</b> but for <b>now at least</b> it <b>is not a betrothal.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between</b> the explanations of Rav Huna and Rav Yehuda? Both agree that if he does not give her the money she is not betrothed. The Gemara answers: <b>The difference between them</b> is in a case <b>where she extended her hand and accepted betrothal from another</b> man during the period between the initial betrothal and the delivery of the money. <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna</b> the betrothal of the second man <b>is not</b> a valid <b>betrothal,</b> as he maintains that when the first man gives her the money the betrothal takes effect retroactively from the time of his earlier statement. <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda,</b> the betrothal of the second man <b>is</b> a valid <b>betrothal,</b> as the betrothal of the first man does not take effect until after he actually gives her the money.
The Gemara comments: <b>And we also learned</b> a mishna <b>concerning bills of divorce like this case</b> (<i>Gittin</i> 74a): With regard to <b>one who says to a woman: This is your bill of divorce on the condition that you will give me two hundred dinars, she is divorced and she shall give</b> him the two hundred dinars. <b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disputed the correct version of this statement. <b>Rav Huna says: And she shall give; Rav Yehuda says: When she gives.</b> The reasons are as stated above in the discussion about betrothal: <b>Rav Huna says: And she shall give,</b> as <b>it is a condition,</b> and therefore <b>she proceeds to fulfill the condition. Rav Yehuda says: When she gives,</b> as <b>when she will give</b> the money <b>to him it will be</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce,</b> but <b>now, in any event,</b> it <b>is not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b>

Daf 60b

<b>What is</b> the difference <b>between</b> the explanations of Rav Huna and Rav Yehuda? Even Rav Huna agrees that she cannot marry someone else until she gives him the money. Until that point the bill of divorce does not come into effect and she remains married to the first man. The Gemara answers: <b>The difference between them</b> is in a case <b>where the bill of divorce was torn or lost</b> after she received it but before she gave him the money. <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna it is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce,</b> as the divorce takes effect from the moment he gives her the document. <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda it is not a</b> valid <b>bill of divorce,</b> as he maintains that the bill of divorce goes into effect only later, which is impossible as it is either torn or lost.
The Gemara comments: <b>And it is necessary</b> to state both disputes, the one with regard to betrothal and the with regard to divorce, as neither <i>halakha</i> could be derived from the other. <b>As had</b> it <b>taught us</b> only that the two Sages disagree <b>with regard to betrothal,</b> one might have said that it is <b>there</b> that <b>Rav Huna says</b> that the betrothal takes effect immediately, despite the fact that he must still give her the money, <b>because</b> betrothal <b>comes to draw her near</b> to him. Therefore, it is likely that he meant for the betrothal to take immediate effect. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>divorce, when he comes to distance her,</b> you might <b>say</b> that Rav Huna <b>concedes to Rav Yehuda</b> that the divorce comes into effect only from the moment she gives him the money.
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if</b> the dispute had been <b>stated</b> only <b>with regard to this</b> case concerning a bill of divorce, one might have claimed that <b>Rav Huna says</b> that the bill of divorce comes into immediate effect only <b>in this</b> situation, <b>because he is not ashamed to demand</b> the money <b>from her</b> whenever he wants, and therefore he divorces her immediately. <b>But here,</b> concerning a betrothal, <b>when she is ashamed to claim</b> the money <b>from him,</b> you might <b>say that</b> Rav Huna <b>concedes to Rav Yehuda</b> that the woman does not accept the betrothal until she actually receives the money. It is therefore <b>necessary</b> for the dispute to be stated in both cases.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rav Yehuda from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 5:5): If one says to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce on the condition that you will give me two hundred dinars, even if the bill of divorce was torn or lost she is divorced.</b> But <b>she may not marry another</b> man <b>until she gives</b> him the money. This ruling apparently accords with Rav Huna’s opinion that the bill of divorce goes into immediate effect from the moment it is given.
<b>And it is further taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a man who <b>said to</b> his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce on the condition that you will give me two hundred dinars, and he died</b> childless, if <b>she gave</b> him the money <b>she is not bound</b> by a levirate bond <b>to the <i>yavam</i>,</b> as she is already divorced. But if <b>she did not give</b> him the money <b>she is bound</b> by a levirate bond <b>to the <i>yavam</i>. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> If she did not give it to her husband during his lifetime <b>she</b> may <b>give</b> the money <b>to</b> her late husband’s <b>brother, or to his father, or to one of the relatives</b> who inherit from him, and by doing so she fulfills the condition and is retroactively divorced.
The Gemara analyzes this ruling: The <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree only with regard to</b> the following: One <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that by the phrase: On the condition that you will give <b>me,</b> he meant: To me specifically <b>but not to my heirs.</b> Consequently, if she does not give the money to him she is not divorced, as she cannot fulfill the condition by giving the money to his heirs. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <b>holds</b> that the husband meant: <b>Even to my heirs. In any event, everyone agrees</b> that <b>it is a condition</b> and the divorce takes effect from the moment the bill of divorce is given. This is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rav Yehuda.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Yehuda</b> could <b>say to you:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Anyone who states</b> a condition employing the language: <b>On the condition,</b> is <b>like</b> one who <b>states</b> that the agreement will take effect retroactively <b>from now,</b> even though the condition is fulfilled only later on. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi maintains that the phrase: On the condition, indicates that an action should take effect now provided that a certain action is fulfilled later. <b>And the Rabbis disagree with him,</b> claiming that this expression does not mean that the action should take immediate effect, but only from when the condition is fulfilled. And Rav Yehuda would conclude by adding: <b>And I spoke</b> in accordance <b>with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>
The Gemara analyzes <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that <b>anyone who states</b> a condition employing the language: <b>On the condition,</b> is <b>like</b> one who <b>states</b> that the agreement will take effect retroactively <b>from now,</b> even though the condition is fulfilled only later on. <b>Rabbi Zeira said: When we were in Babylonia we would say:</b> With regard to <b>that</b> which <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Anyone who states</b> a condition employing the language: <b>On the condition,</b> is <b>like</b> one who <b>states</b> that the agreement will take effect retroactively <b>from now,</b> that is Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion, but <b>the Rabbis disagree with him.</b>
<b>When I ascended to there,</b> to Eretz Yisrael, <b>I found Rabbi Asi sitting and saying</b> the following ruling <b>in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: All concede</b> that <b>with regard to one who says</b> to his wife: <b>On the condition,</b> he is <b>like</b> one who <b>states</b> that the divorce will take effect retroactively <b>from now. They disagreed only</b> with regard to one who said to his wife: <b>From today and after</b> my <b>death,</b> whether he is considered to have added a condition or to have retracted from his initial statement.
<b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if one says to his wife: This is your bill of divorce <b>from today and after</b> my <b>death,</b> it is uncertain whether it is a valid <b>bill of divorce or</b> whether it is <b>not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b> This is <b>the statement of the Rabbis.</b> The Rabbis are uncertain whether he has changed his mind from his initial intention of giving the document that day, and now wishes to give a bill of divorce after his death, which is not effective, or whether he was merely adding a condition that the bill of divorce should take effect from today only when he dies. Conversely, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> A document <b>like this</b> is a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda, who said</b> that the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>also disagree with regard to</b> one who says to his wife: <b>On the condition,</b> instead <b>of disagreeing with regard to</b> the case where one says to his wife: <b>From today and after</b> my <b>death, let</b> them <b>disagree with regard to</b> a case where the husband used the expression: <b>On the condition.</b>
The Gemara answers: Rav Yehuda maintains that they disagree over both cases, and the <i>baraita</i> taught the dispute in this manner <b>to convey to you the far-reaching nature</b> of the opinion <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who maintains that even if the husband says to his wife: <b>From today and after</b> my <b>death, this is also</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And let them disagree with regard to</b> a husband who says to his wife: <b>On the condition, to convey to you the far-reaching nature</b> of the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> who hold that it is not a valid bill of divorce even in that case. The Gemara answers: It is <b>preferable</b> to emphasize <b>the power of leniency.</b> It is always better to formulate a dispute in a manner that emphasizes the extent of the lenient opinion.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to one says to a woman: You are hereby betrothed to me <b>on the condition that I will give you</b> a particular sum of money <b>from now</b> and until thirty days have elapsed, if he gives her the money within the allotted time she is betrothed. The Gemara questions the need for this ruling: It is <b>obvious</b> that this is the case. The Gemara explains: This ruling is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that the specified time period <b>is not a</b> proper <b>condition, and he said</b> so only <b>to motivate himself</b> to prove the sincerity of his intentions. The mishna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the time period is an essential part of his condition, and if he fails to give her the money within this period the betrothal is void.
The mishna further teaches that if he says to her: You are hereby betrothed to me <b>on the condition that I have two hundred dinars,</b> if he in fact possesses the specified amount, she is betrothed, but if he does not, she is not betrothed. The Gemara asks: <b>And let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps he has</b> this sum, although he fails to show it to her. How can his betrothal be nullified if there is no conclusive evidence that he does not have the money? <b>And furthermore, it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps he has</b> the money.
The Gemara answers: It is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> case, in the mishna, is referring <b>to a definite betrothal,</b> which is not established in this case, as he has failed to demonstrate that he has the funds. By contrast, <b>that</b> case, in the <i>baraita</i>, is referring to <b>an uncertain betrothal.</b> The betrothal cannot be entirely disregarded, as he might have the money after all.
The mishna teaches that if a man says to her: You are hereby betrothed to me <b>on the condition that I will show you two hundred dinars,</b> she is betrothed and he must show her the money. A Sage <b>taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:6): This woman <b>intended to see only his own</b> money, not simply to be shown any two hundred dinars. With regard to the subsequent ruling of the mishna: <b>And if he showed her</b> the money <b>on the table she is not betrothed,</b> the Gemara comments: This is <b>obvious,</b> as the woman wants to see his own money. The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach <b>that even if he holds</b> somebody else’s <b>money as</b> part of a <b>joint</b> business <b>venture,</b> nevertheless, as the money does not actually belong to him he has failed to fulfill the condition.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to one who says to a woman: You are hereby betrothed to me <b>on the condition that I possess</b> tillable land of <b>a <i>beit kor</i> of earth, she is betrothed,</b> provided that <b>he possesses</b> such land. If he said to her that the betrothal is: <b>On the condition that I possess</b> land <b>in such and such a place, if he possesses</b> land <b>in that place she is betrothed, but if not she is not betrothed.</b> If he said to her: You are hereby betrothed to me <b>on the condition that I will show you a <i>beit kor</i> of earth, she is betrothed, and he shall show her. And if he showed</b> her land <b>in a valley,</b> i.e., a field that does not belong to him among other fields, <b>she is not betrothed.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the statement of the mishna that she is betrothed only if he actually possesses a <i>beit kor</i> of earth, the Gemara asks: <b>And let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps he</b> in fact <b>possesses</b> land of this size. <b>And furthermore, it is</b> explicitly <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>we are concerned</b> in this situation that <b>perhaps he possesses</b> land of this size. The Gemara answers: It is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> case, the one in the mishna, is referring <b>to a definite betrothal,</b> which has not yet been established because he has not proven he owns a field of this kind; and <b>that</b> case, the one in the <i>baraita</i>, is referring <b>to an uncertain betrothal.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need this mishna <b>to teach</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to land, and why do I</b> also need the previous mishna <b>to teach</b> the same ruling <b>with regard to money?</b> There is no clear difference between the two cases. The Gemara answers: It is <b>necessary</b> to state the <i>halakha</i> in both cases, <b>as had</b> one mishna <b>taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> only <b>with regard to money</b> one might have said that it is only in that case that it is uncertain whether she is betrothed, <b>because people tend to hide</b> their money, and therefore his financial status might not be well known. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>land, you</b> might <b>say</b> that <b>if he had land</b> this fact <b>would</b> generate <b>publicity,</b> as one cannot hide land. The mishna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that it is also possible for him to own land without people being aware of it.
§ The mishna teaches: If one says to a woman: You are hereby betrothed to me <b>on the condition that I possess</b> land <b>in such and such a place, if he possesses</b> land in that place she is betrothed, but if not, she is not betrothed. The Gemara questions the need for this ruling: It is <b>obvious</b> that if he does not possess land in that place she is not betrothed, as that was precisely his condition. The Gemara explains that this ruling is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that he can <b>say to her: What difference does it make to you</b> whether the field is in that location or elsewhere, as even if it is farther away <b>I will go to the trouble of bringing</b> the produce from the field to our house, so what loss have you incurred? The mishna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that despite this claim the betrothal is invalid, due to his failure to fulfill the condition.
§ The mishna further teaches: If a one says to a woman: You are hereby betrothed to me <b>on the condition that I will show you a <i>beit kor</i> of earth,</b> she is betrothed, provided that he possesses such land. A Sage <b>taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:6): The woman <b>intended to see only his own</b> land. The mishna further teaches: <b>And if he showed</b> her a plot of land <b>in a valley, she is not betrothed.</b> The Gemara asks: This is <b>obvious;</b> after all, this land does not belong to him. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where he maintains</b> the field <b>as a sharecropper [<i>distora</i>],</b> i.e., he owns a share in it. Nevertheless, as the land does not belong to him she did not have this field in mind, and consequently she is not betrothed.
The Gemara comments: <b>With regard to consecrated</b> property, <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Arakhin</i> 25a):

Daf 61a

With regard to <b>one who consecrates his field during the time of the Jubilee</b> Year, i.e., in an era when the <i>halakhot</i> of the Jubilee Year are observed, if he wishes to redeem it from the Temple treasury <b>he gives fifty silver shekels for</b> an area that yields <b>a <i>ḥomer</i>,</b> i.e., a <i>kor</i>, of <b>barley seed.</b> If the field <b>had crevices,</b> i.e., deep fissures in its surface, <b>ten handbreadths deep, or boulders ten handbreadths high, they are not measured with it,</b> i.e., in the calculation of land that requires redemption. If the crevices or boulders are <b>less than that, they are measured with it.</b>
<b>And we discussed</b> the following problem: <b>Granted, that</b> these areas <b>are not consecrated</b> together <b>with the field,</b> as they are ten handbreadths higher or lower than the rest of the land; but <b>let</b> the crevices and boulders <b>be consecrated by themselves,</b> so that they should require their own redemption of fifty silver shekels per <i>beit kor</i>. <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>as long as</b> an area <b>does not</b> amount to <b>a <i>beit kor</i> it is not important,</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> against this claim from a <i>baraita</i>.
The verse states with regard to one who consecrates his field: “Part of <b>a field</b> of his possession” (Leviticus 27:16). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> this? <b>Since it is stated</b> in the same verse: <b>“The sowing of a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley shall be valued at fifty</b> shekels of silver,” <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies to one who <b>consecrated in this manner,</b> i.e., consecrated an area fit to sow a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley. <b>From where</b> do I derive that this <i>halakha</i> <b>includes</b> a smaller area, e.g., one suitable for sowing <b>a half-<i>kor</i>, and half of a half-<i>kor</i>,</b> and the area for <b>a <i>se’a</i>,</b> and <b>a <i>tarkav</i>,</b> which is half a <i>se’a</i>, <b>and half a <i>tarkav</i>, and even</b> the area of <b>a quarter</b>-<i>kav</i>? The <i>baraita</i> restates its question: <b>From where</b> is it derived that these areas of land can also be consecrated and redeemed based on the fixed values of the Torah? <b>The verse states “a field” in any case.</b>
Therefore, the Gemara’s question remains: Why aren’t the crevices and boulders measured by themselves? <b>Mar Ukva bar Ḥama said: Here we are dealing with crevices filled with water. Due to</b> the fact <b>that they are not fit for sowing,</b> the crevices are not considered a field. The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as it teaches</b> the case of crevices, <b>similar to</b> the case of <b>high boulders,</b> which are also unsuitable for sowing. The Gemara affirms: <b>Learn from</b> this comparison that this explanation is correct.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if the crevices, like the boulders, are unfit for sowing, then <b>even</b> if there is a disparity of <b>less than</b> ten handbreadths <b>as well,</b> the crevices and boulders should likewise not be measured as part of the field. The Gemara answers: If they are separated from the field by less than ten handbreadths, <b>these</b> crevices <b>are called the cracks in the ground.</b> Similarly, boulders less than ten handbreadths high <b>are called the spine of the ground.</b> They are considered regular features of fields, which typically have a few pits and mounds.
<b>With regard to a sale</b> of a field, <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 102b): In the case of <b>one who says to another: I am selling you a <i>beit kor</i> of earth,</b> if <b>there were crevices ten handbreadths deep or boulders ten handbreadths high</b> in the field, <b>they are not measured with it;</b> if the crevices or boulders were <b>less than that, they are measured with it. And Mar Ukva bar Ḥama says: Even if they are not filled with water,</b> nevertheless they are not included.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this difference between the two rulings of Mar Ukva bar Ḥama? Why in the case of a sale are crevices not considered part of the field even if they are not filled with water? <b>Rav Pappa says: Because a person</b> who buys a field <b>does not want to give his money for one field and</b> yet <b>it appears to him like two or three places.</b> When purchasing a parcel of land, it is important to the purchaser that the land be one contiguous unit so as to enable farming it without difficulty. Therefore, these areas of ten handbreadths are not measured as part of the field regardless of whether or not they are filled with water.
Having discussed the <i>halakhot</i> of a field with regard to consecration and sales, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>here,</b> with regard to measuring a field to see if it fulfills the condition stipulated by one who betroths a woman, if it contains large crevices that are not filled with water? Do <b>we compare it to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>consecrated</b> property and include these places, <b>or do we compare it to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a sale,</b> which means that they are not included? The Gemara answers: <b>It stands to reason</b> that <b>we compare it to</b> the case of <b>consecrated</b> property, <b>as</b> the husband can <b>say to her: I will go to the trouble of sowing and bringing</b> the produce from the lower or higher areas as well. Although the labor requires additional effort, he does possess a <i>beit kor</i> of land.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Meir says: Any condition that is not</b> doubled, i.e., which does not specify both the result of fulfilling the condition and the result of the condition remaining unfulfilled, <b>like the condition</b> Moses stipulated with <b>the children of Gad and the children of Reuben</b> who sought to settle on the eastern side of the Jordan, <b>is not</b> a valid <b>condition</b> and is not taken into account at all. <b>As it is stated: “And</b> Moses <b>said to them, if the children of Gad and the children of Reuben pass over</b> the Jordan with you, every man armed for battle before the Lord, and the land shall be subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession” (Numbers 32:29). <b>And it is written</b> afterward: <b>“But if they will not pass over armed</b> with you, they shall receive a possession among you in the land of Canaan” (Numbers 32:30).
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel says:</b> One cannot derive the requirements of conditions in general from that particular case, as with regard to the nullification of the condition of the children of Gad and Reuben it was <b>necessary to state the matter, as otherwise,</b> if the verse had not specified both sides of the condition, <b>it might have</b> been thought it <b>meant that they will not inherit even in the land of Canaan.</b> One might have thought that if the tribes of Gad and Reuben would not fulfill the condition, they would forfeit their right to inherit anywhere. It was therefore necessary to specify that they would not lose their portion in Eretz Yisrael. Consequently, it is possible that with regard to a standard condition, where no such misunderstanding is likely to take place, it is not necessary to mention both sides.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel is saying well,</b> i.e., presenting a reasonable objection, <b>to Rabbi Meir.</b> He apparently refuted Rabbi Meir’s opinion entirely. How would Rabbi Meir respond? The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Meir</b> could have <b>said to you: If it enters your mind</b> that the verse <b>does not come</b> to teach the requirement of <b>a compound condition</b> to stipulate both positive and negative outcomes, <b>let it</b> merely <b>write: But if they will not pass over they shall receive a possession among you,</b> which would indicate that they have a portion in the land. The verse actually proceeds to state: <b>“In the land of Canaan.”</b>

Daf 61b

<b>Why do I</b> need this extra phrase? <b>Conclude from it that it comes to</b> teach the requirement of <b>a compound condition.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel says: If the Merciful One had not written: “In the land of Canaan,” I would say</b> that the requirement: <b>“They shall receive a possession among you”</b> (Numbers 32:30) is referring <b>to the land of Gilead,</b> i.e., this land must be shared with the other tribes. <b>But</b> they would <b>not</b> inherit in <b>the land of Canaan at all.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Meir</b> respond to this claim? He maintains that the expression: <b>“Among you,” means anywhere that you have</b> taken possession, including the land of Canaan. Therefore, the subsequent phrase “the land of Canaan” is superfluous and serves to teach that the condition must be doubled.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to this issue that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel said:</b> Hear <b>a parable: To what is this matter,</b> i.e., the condition of the children of Gad and Reuben, <b>comparable?</b> It is comparable <b>to a person who was dividing up his property among his sons,</b> and <b>said: My son so-and-so shall inherit such and such a field; and my son so-and-so shall inherit such and such a field; and my son so-and-so shall give two hundred dinars and inherit such and such a field, and if he does not give</b> the money <b>he will inherit</b> a part <b>of the remainder of the property with his brothers.</b>
<b>What causes</b> the last brother <b>to inherit</b> a part <b>of the remainder of the property with his brothers?</b> The father’s <b>double</b> formulation of the condition <b>causes him</b> to inherit in this manner. It was therefore necessary for the father to state both sides and explain what will happen if the third brother fails to give the money. Had the father not repeated the condition, upon failing to give the two hundred dinars the son would not have received any portion of the property.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the <b>parable is not similar to the mishna,</b> as <b>there</b> the mishna <b>teaches: It might have</b> been thought it <b>meant that</b> if they do not fulfill the condition <b>they will not inherit even in the land of Canaan,</b> and certainly not in the land of Gilead. This <b>apparently</b> indicates that the <b>double</b> formulation <b>is also effective for</b> them to inherit <b>the land of Gilead</b> with the other tribes. Otherwise, the children of Gad and Reuben would not receive any part of the Gilead either.
<b>And</b> yet <b>here</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: What causes</b> the last brother <b>to inherit</b> a part <b>of the remainder of the property with his brothers?</b> The father’s <b>double</b> formulation <b>causes him.</b> This <b>apparently</b> indicates that the <b>double</b> formulation <b>is effective for the rest of the property,</b> whereas he would have received that portion of the field linked to the condition in any case. According to this reasoning, the children of Gad and Reuben would have been granted a portion in the land of Gilead even without the double formulation.
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> case, referring to Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel’s ruling in the mishna, was stated <b>before Rabbi Meir said to him</b> that the verse could simply have stated: <b>“They shall receive a possession</b> among you.” At that stage, Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel maintained that if the two tribes did not fulfill the condition they would not inherit even in the land of Gilead, as indicated by his use of the term: Even, in the mishna.
Whereas <b>that</b> case, referring to the parable in the <i>baraita</i>, was taught <b>after Rabbi Meir said to</b> Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel that when the phrase: <b>“They shall receive a possession,”</b> appears by itself it is referring to the land of Canaan. As stated previously, Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel responded by explaining that had the verse not stated: “In the land of Canaan,” one would have said that the requirement: “They shall receive a possession among you” (Numbers 32:30), is referring to the land of Gilead, and they would not inherit in the land of Canaan. In other words, even without the compound condition they would have received a portion in Gilead, which is similar to the parable.
§ The Gemara proceeds to analyze these two opinions: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who requires a compound condition, <b>this is</b> the reason <b>that it is written,</b> with regard to God’s rebuke of Cain: <b>“If you do well, shall it not be lifted up? And if you do not do well, sin crouches at the door”</b> (Genesis 4:7). <b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina</b> ben Gamliel, <b>why do I</b> need both sides of this stipulation to be specified? The Gemara answers: Were it not for the double formulation it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that the verse means: <b>If you do well</b> shall you not receive <b>a reward?</b> And <b>if you do not do well</b> you will receive <b>neither reward nor punishment.</b> The double formulation of the verse <b>teaches us</b> that if Cain fails to do well he will be actively punished.
The Gemara asks another question: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, this is</b> the reason <b>that it is written,</b> with regard to Abraham’s instruction to Eliezer to bring a wife for Isaac: <b>“Then you shall be clear from my oath</b>…if they will not give her to you” (Genesis 24:41). <b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel, why do I</b> need this addition? The positive formulation of the oath already indicates the negative.
The Gemara answers: It was <b>necessary</b> for this to be stated; if Abraham had stated only: “And take a wife for my son” (Genesis 24:38), it might <b>enter your mind to say:</b> In a case <b>where</b> the arrangement <b>is satisfactory for her, but not satisfactory for</b> her family, he <b>should bring</b> her <b>against their wishes.</b> The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that Eliezer is not obligated to bring her against her family’s wishes.
The Gemara inquires about another verse in that chapter: <b>“If the woman is not willing</b> to follow you” (Genesis 24:8). <b>Why do I</b> need this clause? The Gemara answers: It was <b>necessary,</b> since it might <b>enter your mind to say: If it is satisfactory for them but not satisfactory for her,</b> he <b>should bring</b> her <b>against her wishes.</b> The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that he should not bring her against her wishes.
The Gemara asks a related question: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, this is</b> the reason <b>that it is written: “If you walk in My statutes”</b> (Leviticus 26:3), you will receive blessings; conversely: <b>“And if you shall reject My statutes”</b> (Leviticus 26:15), you will receive curses. <b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel, why do I</b> need both of these clauses? The Gemara answers: They are both <b>necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say: If you follow My statutes</b> you will receive <b>a blessing,</b> whereas <b>if you reject My statutes</b> you will receive <b>neither a blessing nor a curse.</b> The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the rejection of God’s statutes warrants a curse.
The Gemara again inquires: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, this is</b> the reason <b>that it is written: “If you are willing and obedient</b> you shall eat the good of the land” (Isaiah 1:19), whereas: <b>“But if you refuse and rebel</b> you shall be devoured by the sword” (Isaiah 1:20). <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel, why do I</b> need the double formulation? The Gemara answers in a similar fashion: It is <b>necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say: “If you are willing”</b> you will receive <b>good,</b> i.e., reward, <b>“but if you refuse”</b> you will receive <b>neither good nor bad.</b> The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case, and one who rebels will receive punishment.
In connection with the verse from Isaiah, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase:

Daf 62a

<b>“You shall be devoured by the sword”</b> (Isaiah 1:20)? <b>Rava says:</b> This verse should be interpreted as if it states: You shall devour the sword, i.e., you shall eat food that harms the body like a sword, e.g., <b>coarse grains [<i>gelalenita</i>] of salt, hard barley bread, and onions. As the Master said: Dried bakery [<i>purnei</i>] bread</b> eaten <b>with salt and onions harms the body like swords.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel, this is</b> the reason <b>that it is written</b> with regard to a <i>sota</i>: <b>“If no man has lain with you, and if you have not gone aside to uncleanness, being under your husband, you shall be free [<i>hinnaki</i>]”</b> (Numbers 5:19), without specifying the negative side of this condition. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> the verse <b>should have</b> stated: And if a man has lain with you, <b>you should choke [<i>ḥinnaki</i>]</b> and die. According to the opinion of Rabbi Meir, the verse should have clarified the other side of the condition and its ensuing punishment. <b>Rabbi Tanḥum said:</b> Indeed, a truncated form of <b><i>hinnaki</i></b> without the letter <i>yod</i> <b>is written.</b> This indicates that the word should be interpreted in two ways, as both <i>hinnaki</i> and <i>ḥinnaki</i>.
The Gemara continues: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, this is</b> the reason <b>that it is written <i>hinnaki</i></b> without the <i>yod</i>, to allude to the other side of the condition. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel, why do I</b> need this word to be written in this way? The Gemara answers: It is <b>necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say: If no man has lain with you, you shall be free, and if he has lain</b> with you, you should <b>neither be free nor choke; rather,</b> it is <b>merely a prohibition</b> that does not warrant a severe punishment. The unusual form of the term <i>hinnaki</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case.
<b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, this is</b> the reason <b>that it is written,</b> with regard to one being purified with the water of purification from contact with a corpse: <b>“He shall purify himself with it on the third day and on the seventh day, and he shall be pure; but if he does not purify himself</b> on the third day and on the seventh day he shall not be pure” (Numbers 19:11–12). <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel, why do I</b> need this double formulation?
The Gemara answers: It is <b>necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say: The mitzva of sprinkling</b> the water of purification must be performed <b>on the third and seventh</b> days <i>ab initio</i>, <b>but if he performed</b> it <b>on one of them</b> alone, the ritual is considered <b>performed</b> and he is purified after the fact. The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case.
The Gemara asks about a later verse in the same chapter: <b>“And the pure shall sprinkle on the impure on the third day and on the seventh day”</b> (Numbers 19:19). <b>Why do I</b> need this repetition of the command? This was already stated earlier. The Gemara answers: It is <b>necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that the <b>third</b> day <b>excludes</b> the <b>second,</b> i.e., he cannot receive the sprinkling of the water of purification before the third day, and similarly the <b>seventh excludes</b> the <b>sixth</b> day, <b>because he</b> thereby <b>decreases the days of purity</b> before the sprinkling. <b>But if he performed</b> the sprinkling <b>on the third and on the eighth</b> days, <b>in</b> which case <b>he increases</b> and adds <b>to the days of purity,</b> you might <b>say</b> that this is <b>proper.</b> The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that there must be a fixed interval of four days between each sprinkling ritual.
The Gemara further analyzes this verse: <b>Why do I</b> need the phrase: <b>“And on the seventh day he shall purify him”</b> (Numbers 19:19)? The Gemara answers: It is <b>necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say: This matter,</b> i.e., the requirement to receive the sprinkling twice, <b>applies</b> only <b>for</b> eating and touching <b>consecrated</b> meat; <b>but for</b> partaking of <b><i>teruma</i> one</b> sprinkling is <b>also sufficient.</b> The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who betroths a woman and</b> later <b>says:</b> When I betrothed her <b>I thought that she was the daughter of a priest, and</b> it turned out that <b>she is the daughter of a Levite,</b> or if he claims that he thought she was <b>the daughter of a Levite and she is</b> actually <b>the daughter of a priest,</b> or if he claims that he thought she was <b>poor and she is wealthy;</b> or <b>wealthy and she is poor,</b> in all of these cases <b>she is betrothed, because she did not mislead him,</b> and no explicit condition was stated with regard to these matters.
With regard to <b>one who says to a woman: You are hereby betrothed to me after I convert, or: After you convert,</b> or if he was a Canaanite slave and says: <b>After I am emancipated, or</b> if she was a Canaanite maidservant and he says: <b>After you are emancipated,</b> or if he says to a married woman: <b>After your husband dies, or</b> to his wife’s sister: <b>After your sister dies,</b> or if he says to a woman awaiting levirate marriage or <i>ḥalitza</i> from a brother-in-law [<i>yavam</i>], who in the opinion of this <i>tanna</i> cannot be betrothed by another man: <b>After your <i>yavam</i> performs <i>ḥalitza</i> for you,</b> in all these cases <b>she is not betrothed.</b> Since he cannot betroth her at the present time, his attempt at betrothal is ineffective.
<b>And similarly,</b> with regard to <b>one who says to another: If your wife gives birth to a female</b> the child <b>is hereby betrothed to me,</b> even if she becomes pregnant, or is pregnant but her pregnancy is not known, if she gives birth to a girl, that child <b>is not betrothed</b> to him. But <b>if</b> he said this when <b>the wife of the other</b> man <b>was pregnant and her fetus was discernible</b> at the time, i.e., her pregnancy was known, <b>his statement is upheld, and</b> therefore <b>if she gives birth to a girl,</b> the child <b>is betrothed</b> to him.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Terumot</i> 1:5): <b>One may not separate <i>teruma</i> from</b> produce that has been <b>detached</b> from the ground <b>for,</b> i.e., to render permitted, produce that is <b>attached</b> to the ground. Produce still attached to the ground is not included in the obligation of <i>teruma</i>. <b>And if he separated <i>teruma</i></b> in this manner, <b>his <i>teruma</i> is not <i>teruma</i>,</b> even after the produce has been detached from the ground.
<b>Rav Asi raised a dilemma before Rabbi Yoḥanan: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if one <b>said: The detached produce of this garden bed should be <i>teruma</i> for the attached produce of this garden bed;</b> or: <b>The attached produce of this garden bed should be <i>teruma</i> for the detached produce of this garden bed,</b> not now but <b>when they will be detached; and</b> the produce <b>was</b> subsequently <b>detached?</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: Anything that is in one’s power</b> to perform <b>is not considered lacking</b> in its <b>action.</b> Since he could theoretically detach the produce at this very moment, <i>teruma</i> can be separated from it.
Rav Asi <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan from the mishna. With regard to <b>one who says to a woman: You are hereby betrothed to me after I convert,</b> or: <b>After you convert,</b> or: <b>After I am emancipated,</b> or: <b>After you are emancipated,</b> or: <b>After your husband dies,</b> or: <b>After your sister dies,</b> or: <b>After your <i>yavam</i> performs <i>ḥalitza</i> for you,</b> in all of these cases <b>she is not betrothed.</b>
Rav Asi explains his objection: <b>Granted,</b> in <b>all</b> of <b>these</b> cases but one <b>it is not in his power</b> to bring about the situation when he will be able to betroth her, <b>but</b> in the case of <b>a convert,</b> the matter <b>is in his power,</b> as he could convert now if he so chooses. According to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, any action that could potentially be performed is considered as though it has actually been performed. The Gemara responds: In the case of <b>a convert, it is also not in his power</b> to convert whenever he wants, <b>as Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b>

Daf 62b

<b>A convert requires</b> the presence of <b>three</b> Jews for his conversion. <b>What is the reason</b> for this requirement? <b>It is written with regard to</b> a convert: “You shall have one manner of <b>law,</b> for the convert as for the homeborn” (Leviticus 24:22), which indicates that a conversion is <b>considered a judgment</b> that requires three judges. And if he requires three judges, <b>who says that those three will be available to him?</b> Since he cannot convert at a time of his choosing, it is not considered within his power to convert.
<b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel objects to this: If that is so,</b> and anything that is in one’s power to perform is not considered lacking in its action, <b>one who gives one <i>peruta</i> to his</b> Canaanite <b>maidservant and says: You are hereby betrothed to me after I emancipate you, so too</b> will you say <b>that it is a betrothal</b> because he has the power to emancipate her? The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> the Canaanite maidservant <b>initially</b> had the legal status of <b>an animal,</b> i.e., she is not subject to betrothal at all, whereas <b>now</b> she has <b>an independent mind.</b> Once she has been emancipated she has the status of a Jew and is not considered the same person at all. Consequently, the attempted betrothal is certainly considered lacking an action.
The Gemara asks: <b>But that which Rabbi Oshaya says:</b> With regard to <b>one who gives one <i>peruta</i> to his wife and says to her: You are hereby betrothed to me after I divorce you, she is not betrothed, so too according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> will you say <b>that it is a betrothal</b> because he has the power to divorce her? The Gemara answers: <b>Although he has the power to divorce her,</b> does <b>he have the power to betroth her</b> against her will? It is not in his power to effect the betrothal, as once she has divorced him the matter is no longer exclusively dependent upon him.
The Gemara comments: Being that it is not in his power to effect the betrothal, you can use this logic to <b>resolve</b> the <b>dilemma raised</b> by <b>Rav Oshaya:</b> What is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>one who gives two <i>perutot</i> to a woman,</b> and <b>with one he says to her: Be betrothed to me today, and with</b> the other <b>one he says to her: Be betrothed to me after I divorce you?</b> What is her status after he divorces her? That dilemma was left unanswered, and the Gemara suggests that you can <b>resolve from here that it is not a betrothal.</b> The Gemara explains that this case is different, and Rav Oshaya’s dilemma was actually as follows: <b>Perhaps</b> in that situation, <b>just as the betrothal is effective now, it is also effective afterward.</b> Since she is currently under her own authority and agrees to betroth herself to him, it is possible that she can now consent to a betrothal that will take effect at a later time.
The Gemara comments: It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan: One may not separate <i>teruma</i> from the detached for the attached, and if he separated <i>teruma</i>, his <i>teruma</i> is not <i>teruma</i>. How so?</b> If <b>he said: The detached produce of this garden bed will be <i>teruma</i> for the attached produce of this garden bed,</b> or: <b>The attached produce of this garden bed will be <i>teruma</i> for the detached produce of this garden bed, he has not said anything</b> of consequence, as the obligation to separate <i>teruma</i> applies only to detached produce. <b>But</b> if <b>he said</b> that the attached produce will be <i>teruma</i> <b>when they will be detached, and they become detached, his statement is valid,</b> as he has the power to detach them.
<b>Moreover, Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov said</b> that <b>even</b> if <b>one said: The detached produce of this garden bed will be <i>teruma</i> for the attached produce of this garden bed,</b> or: <b>The attached produce of this garden bed will be <i>teruma</i> for the detached produce of this garden bed when they,</b> i.e., the attached produce, <b>will reach one-third</b> of their growth <b>and are detached,</b> although at the time they had yet to ripen which means that the obligations of <i>terumot</i> and tithes do not apply to them, when <b>they will reach one-third</b> of their growth <b>and are detached, his statement is upheld.</b>
<b>Rabba says: Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says</b> this ruling <b>only with regard to fodder,</b> produce that has grown stalks even if it is not yet ripe. <b>But</b> he did <b>not</b> refer <b>to</b> produce that is still completely <b>soft [<i>agam</i>]. Rav Yosef says:</b> He <b>even</b> referred <b>to soft</b> produce. In relation to this dispute, the Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> word <b><i>agam</i> is a term of growth [<i>butzlana</i>]?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that this is <b>as the verse states: “Is it to bow down his head as a bulrush [<i>ke’agmon</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 58:5), i.e., like a soft, drooping plant.
§ The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is <b>that which is taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who says to another: If your wife gives birth to a female she is betrothed to me, he has not said anything? And Rabbi Ḥanina says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the other’s <b>wife is not pregnant. But</b> if <b>his wife is pregnant his statement is upheld. In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this ruling? The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> can be explained in accordance with everyone’s opinion. <b>If</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba,</b> it is referring to a situation <b>where her fetus was</b> already <b>noticeable,</b> just as the stalks of fodder are recognizable. <b>If</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef,</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i> applies <b>even if her fetus was not</b> yet <b>noticeable.</b>
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of this dispute. <b>Rabba says: Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says</b> his ruling <b>only with regard to fodder of a non-irrigated field,</b> which is not watered. <b>But</b> he did <b>not</b> speak <b>about fodder of an irrigated field.</b> Since the produce of this field will not grow on its own if it is not watered, it is not considered as if this produce has entered the world. <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov referred <b>even to fodder of an irrigated field,</b> as this produce too is treated as having entered the world when it reaches the stage of fodder.
The Gemara asks: According to this version of the dispute, <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion is <b>that which is taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one says to another: If your wife gives birth to a female she is betrothed to me, he has not said anything? And Rabbi Ḥanina says: They taught</b> this <b>only when his wife is not pregnant, but</b> if <b>his wife is pregnant his statement is upheld. In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this ruling? The <i>baraita</i> must be referring to a case <b>where her fetus was noticeable,</b> and therefore <b>everyone agrees</b> with this ruling. The <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinions of both Rabba and Rav Yosef, as even Rav Yosef agrees that Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov was referring only to fodder whose stalks were already noticeable.
<b>Abaye says: Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, and Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and Rabbi Meir all hold</b> the following principle: <b>A person can transfer an entity that has not yet come into the world.</b> That is, one can perform an act of acquisition for an item that is not yet in existence. The opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov</b> is referring to <b>that which we</b> just <b>said,</b> that one can separate <i>teruma</i> even for produce not yet included in this mitzva. Where does <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi state a similar opinion? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:

Daf 63a

With regard to the verse: <b>“You shall not deliver a slave to his master”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:16), <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: The verse is speaking of one who acquires a slave,</b> not to enslave him but <b>in order to emancipate him.</b> The court may not deliver the slave to this master, as this master has no right to enslave him. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: For example, if</b> the new master <b>wrote to</b> the slave in his bill of manumission: <b>When I will purchase you, you are hereby acquired to yourself from now.</b> In that case the slave acquires himself from that moment, despite the fact that the buyer does not own him. This shows that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi maintains that a person can transfer an item that has not yet entered the world, as one can emancipate his slave before acquiring him.
<b>Rabbi Meir</b> also holds that one can transfer an entity that has not yet come into the world, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who says to a woman: You are hereby betrothed to me after I convert,</b> or: <b>After you convert,</b> or: <b>After I am emancipated,</b> or: <b>After you are emancipated,</b> or: <b>After your husband dies,</b> or: <b>After your sister dies,</b> or: <b>After your <i>yavam</i> performs <i>ḥalitza</i> for you, she is not betrothed. Rabbi Meir</b> disagrees and <b>says: She is betrothed. Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar says: She is not betrothed.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says</b> that in some of these cases, by Torah law <b>she is betrothed. And</b> for <b>what reason did</b> the Sages <b>say she is not betrothed? Due to enmity.</b> Giving betrothal to a married woman that will take effect after her husband dies can engender enmity between the woman and her husband. Giving betrothal to one sister that depends on the death of the other can engender enmity between the sisters. Nevertheless, Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi maintain that one can betroth a woman who is currently forbidden to him.
The Gemara asks: <b>And let us also count Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi</b> among those who maintain that a person can acquire an entity that has not yet come into the world. The reason it asks is that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi is merely called Rabbi above. The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>is</b> the same as <b>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi;</b> they are one person.
The Gemara asks: <b>And let us also count Rabbi Akiva, as it is taught</b> in a mishna (see <i>Nedarim</i> 85a): If a woman stated a vow to her husband: <b>I will</b> not <b>produce</b> anything <b>for you,</b> including the work that she is obligated to do for him according to the terms of her marriage contract, as <b>that is <i>konam</i>,</b> i.e., forbidden like an offering, for me, her husband <b>need not nullify</b> the vow at all. It is automatically void, since she is obligated to perform those tasks.
<b>Rabbi Akiva says: He should</b> nevertheless <b>nullify</b> the vow, as <b>perhaps she will exceed</b> the required amount of work and do <b>more for him than is fitting for him</b> to receive. If she does more than the fixed amount of work that a woman is obligated to perform for her husband, the vow will be valid with respect to the excess to which he is not legally entitled, and he might inadvertently come to benefit from something that is forbidden to him. That excess is an entity that has not yet come into the world. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Wasn’t it</b> already <b>stated with regard to</b> this ruling that <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says:</b> This is referring <b>to</b> a woman <b>who says: Let my hands be sanctified to their Maker?</b> She sanctifies her actual hands, <b>and</b> these <b>hands exist in the world;</b> therefore the vow takes effect.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who says to a woman: You are hereby betrothed to me on the condition that I will speak</b> in <b>your</b> favor <b>to the authorities,</b> e.g., to help her address some legal matter, or: On the condition that <b>I will act for you as a laborer,</b> if <b>he spoke</b> in <b>her</b> favor <b>to the authorities or acted for her as a laborer, she is betrothed. But if not, she is not betrothed.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Reish Lakish says: And this</b> <i>halakha</i> applies only <b>if he gave her</b> an item <b>worth one <i>peruta</i></b> at the time of the betrothal. She is not betrothed via his recommendation to the authorities or via the work itself, as these are merely conditions appended to the betrothal. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is she <b>not</b> betrothed <b>by the</b> monetary <b>value</b> of his recommendation or action? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if one says to a woman: You are hereby betrothed to me <b>by</b> the monetary <b>value</b> you received <b>when I had you ride on a donkey,</b> or: By the monetary value you received <b>when I had you sit on a wagon [<i>karon</i>], or:</b> By the monetary value you received when I had you ride <b>in a boat, she is not betrothed,</b> as she has already done the action and therefore owes him this debt, and one cannot betroth a woman with a loan.
But if he says to her: <b>By</b> the monetary <b>value</b> you will receive <b>when I will have you ride on a donkey,</b> or: By the monetary value you will receive <b>when I will have you sit on a wagon, or:</b> By the monetary value you will receive when I will have you ride <b>in a boat, she is betrothed. And if you would say</b> that <b>here too,</b> it is referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where he gave her</b> an item <b>worth one <i>peruta</i>,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>says: By</b> the monetary <b>value,</b> which indicates that she is betrothed via this sum.
<b>And furthermore, it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if a woman says to a man: <b>Sit together with me and I will be betrothed to you,</b> or: <b>Perform entertainment before me,</b> or: <b>Dance before me,</b> or: <b>Perform</b> work for me <b>like this layer [<i>dimus</i>]</b> of a building, the court <b>appraises</b> the monetary value of his action. <b>If</b> the action he performs for her <b>is worth the value of one <i>peruta</i>, she is betrothed, but if not, she is not betrothed. And if you would say</b> that <b>here too,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where he gave her</b> an item <b>worth one <i>peruta</i>,</b> and the betrothal is with that; <b>but</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>says:</b> The court <b>appraises it.</b> If this were merely a condition, there would be no need for an appraisal. Isn’t this <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish?</b>
The Gemara answers that <b>Reish Lakish</b> could have <b>said to you: This <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> maintains</b> that the obligation to pay a person’s <b>wage</b> is incurred <b>only at the end</b> of the period for which he was hired. Consequently, she is betrothed via money rather than by a loan. <b>And the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>maintains</b> that the obligation to pay <b>a wage is</b> incurred continuously <b>from the beginning</b> of the period he was hired <b>to</b> its <b>end.</b> Since the debt accumulates throughout the duration that the service is performed, by the time he has finished the work she owes him the entire sum, and a debt cannot be used for a betrothal.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what forces Reish Lakish to establish the mishna in</b> accordance with the opinion <b>that</b> the obligation to pay <b>a wage is</b> incurred continuously <b>from the beginning</b> of the period he was hired <b>to</b> its <b>end, and</b> that it is referring to a case <b>where he gave her</b> the value of one <i>peruta</i>? Why does he reject the possibility that the mishna is referring to one who did not give an extra <i>peruta</i>, and instead he betrothed her with the value of the service he performed, in accordance with the opinion that the obligation to pay a person’s wage is incurred only at the end of the period for which he was hired?
The Gemara replies: <b>Rava said</b> that <b>the mishna was difficult for</b> Reish Lakish: <b>Why does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>specifically teach: On the condition? Let him teach: By</b> the monetary <b>value,</b> as stated in the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rather, conclude from</b> it that <b>any</b> statement of: <b>On the condition,</b> is referring to a stipulation, and therefore the mishna must be dealing with a case <b>where he has</b> already <b>given her</b> the value of one <i>peruta</i>. Consequently, the value of his service cannot be the money for the betrothal itself, and instead serves as a later condition.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to one who betroths a woman and says to her that the betrothal is: <b>On the condition that</b> my <b>father will want</b> this betrothal, if his <b>father wants</b> it, <b>she is betrothed; but if not, she is not betrothed.</b> If <b>the father dies, she is betrothed,</b> despite the fact that he did not reveal his wishes. If <b>the son dies, one instructs the father to say that he does not want</b> the betrothal, so that the betrothal will never have taken effect, thereby enabling her to avoid the requirement of levirate marriage.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>On the condition that</b> my <b>father will want</b> this betrothal? <b>If we say</b> it means they are not married <b>until</b> his <b>father says yes,</b> indicating his agreement, then <b>say the middle clause</b> of the mishna: If <b>the father dies, she is betrothed. But</b> how can she be betrothed? After all, <b>he did not say yes,</b> and the condition was not fulfilled. <b>Rather,</b>

Daf 63b

the phrase: On the condition that my father wants this betrothal, means: <b>On the condition that</b> my <b>father will remain silent</b> and will not object when he hears of the betrothal. But if this is the case, <b>say the last clause</b> of the mishna: If <b>the son died, one instructs the father to say that he does not want</b> the betrothal. <b>Why</b> should this matter? After all, <b>he remained silent</b> when he first heard about it. Clearly his mere silence does not constitute agreement. <b>Rather,</b> one must say that the phrase: On the condition that my father wants this betrothal, means that <b>he said to her: On the condition that</b> my <b>father will not object</b> to this betrothal at any point in time.
The Gemara asks: Wouldn’t this mean that <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna describes <b>one reason,</b> i.e., one set of circumstances, <b>and the middle clause and last clause</b> describe <b>one</b> other <b>reason? Rabbi Yannai said: Yes,</b> this is so. <b>Reish Lakish said: Conclude from</b> his statement that <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yannai one forces a mishna</b> to be explained as <b>following two reasons, and in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of one <i>tanna</i>, rather than establishing</b> a mishna as following the opinions of <b>two <i>tanna’im</i> and one reason.</b> In other words, an interpretation that maintains the unified attribution of one mishna is preferable, even if one is thereby forced to say that it addresses different situations.
<b>Rav Yosef bar Ami said: Actually,</b> the entire mishna <b>is</b> addressing <b>one reason,</b> i.e., one case, <b>and what</b> is the meaning of: <b>On the condition that</b> my <b>father wants</b> the betrothal? It means: <b>On the condition that</b> my <b>father will not object from now and until thirty days</b> have elapsed. His silence for thirty days indicates his acceptance of the betrothal.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to a man who said: <b>I betrothed my</b> minor <b>daughter</b> to someone <b>but I do not know to whom I betrothed her, and one</b> man <b>came</b> forward <b>and said: I betrothed her,</b> his claim is <b>deemed credible.</b> If two men stepped forward and <b>this</b> one <b>said: I betrothed her, and that</b> one <b>said: I betrothed her,</b> they must <b>both give</b> her <b>a bill of divorce</b> to render it permitted for her to marry anyone else. <b>And if they</b> so <b>desire, one</b> of them <b>gives</b> her <b>a bill of divorce and</b> the other <b>one may marry</b> her.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav says:</b> When the mishna states that the claim of one who says that he betrothed this girl is deemed credible, it means that he is <b>deemed credible</b> to the extent that he <b>may give</b> her <b>a bill of divorce, but</b> he is <b>not deemed credible to marry</b> her. He is <b>deemed credible to give</b> her <b>a bill of divorce,</b> as there is a presumption that <b>a person sins only for his own</b> benefit. No one is suspected of sinning when he does not stand to gain from it. Since he is not allowed to marry her himself, we do not say that he lied without purpose. <b>But he is not deemed credible to marry</b> her, as we <b>say</b> that <b>his inclination</b> might have <b>overcome him,</b> leading him to falsely claim that he is the one who betrothed her.
<b>Rav Asi</b> disagrees with Rav’s interpretation of the mishna and <b>says: He</b> is <b>deemed credible even to marry</b> her, as he would not dare to lie directly to the father of the girl he claims to have betrothed. <b>And Rav Asi concedes in</b> the case of a woman <b>who says: I became betrothed but I do not know to whom I became betrothed, and one</b> man <b>came and said: I betrothed her, that he is not deemed credible to marry her.</b> In this situation she might have agreed to collude with him, as the Gemara will explain.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that if <b>they</b> so <b>desire, one</b> of them <b>gives</b> her <b>a bill of divorce and</b> the other <b>one may marry</b> her. This is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rav,</b> who says that he may not marry her. The Gemara answers: <b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you: There,</b> in our mishna, <b>it is different, as, since there is another</b> person <b>with him</b> also claiming to have betrothed her, <b>he is afraid</b> to lie.
The Gemara comments: It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Asi:</b> If a man said: <b>I have betrothed my daughter</b> to someone <b>but I do not know to whom I betrothed her, and one</b> person <b>came</b> forward <b>and said: I betrothed her,</b> he is <b>deemed credible even to marry</b> her. If that person <b>married her, and another</b> man <b>came</b> forward <b>and said:</b> It was <b>I</b> who <b>betrothed her, it is not within</b> the second man’s <b>power to prohibit her to</b> her husband.
The <i>baraita</i> cites another case: With regard to <b>a woman who said: I became betrothed but I do not know to whom I became betrothed, and one</b> man <b>came and said: I betrothed</b> her, he is <b>not deemed credible to marry</b> her. Why not? <b>Because she is protecting him.</b> Perhaps she decided only now that she wants to marry him and is therefore identifying him as the man who betrothed her, although she knows it was someone else. The same suspicions do not arise in the case of a father, who has no inclinations in this regard.
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: In the case of the mishna, where the father claims to have betrothed his daughter to someone, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to stoning based on</b> the father’s account? Is a father who says: I betrothed my daughter, deemed credible to the extent that she is stoned as an adulteress if she engages in sexual intercourse with someone? <b>Rav says</b> the court <b>does not stone</b> her, <b>and Rav Asi says</b> the court <b>stones</b> her.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rav said</b> that the court <b>does not stone</b> her, because <b>when the Merciful One deems the father credible</b> when he says he betrothed his daughter, this is referring only <b>to the prohibition</b> against her marrying anyone else. By contrast, <b>with regard to killing</b> her, the Torah <b>did not deem him credible. Rav Asi said:</b> The court <b>stones</b> her, as <b>the Merciful One deems the father credible with regard to all matters,</b> including the death penalty. <b>Rav Asi says: And I concede</b> in the case <b>of</b> a woman who <b>says: I became betrothed, that</b> the court <b>does not stone</b> her on the basis of her own admission.
<b>And Rav Asi says: These <i>halakhot</i> of mine are roof breakers,</b> i.e., they are difficult and incomprehensible. Rav Asi explains: <b>Now, in a case where</b> a father said: I have betrothed my daughter to someone but I do not know to whom, <b>where if</b> someone <b>came to marry</b> her he is deemed credible and <b>may marry</b> her, which means <b>you say</b> that the court then <b>stones</b> her on the basis of the father’s testimony if she later commits adultery, <b>is it not logical that</b> the court should <b>stone</b> her in <b>a case</b> where a woman said: I became betrothed but I do not know to whom, thereby prohibiting herself to everyone to the extent that <b>if</b> someone <b>came to marry</b> her <b>he may not marry</b> her?
<b>But</b> that <b>is not so,</b> i.e., Rav Asi’s rulings are in fact reasonable: <b>The Merciful One deems credible a father</b> who says that his daughter is betrothed, and therefore she can even be stoned, but the Torah <b>did not deem her,</b> i.e., the woman herself, <b>credible</b> in this regard. She does not receive a special degree of credibility, and although she can declare herself a forbidden item, i.e., she can render herself forbidden to all men, as far as punishment is concerned her claim is treated by a court in accordance with the regular rules of evidence.
<b>And Rav Ḥisda said: Both</b> in <b>this</b> case, when the father says: I betrothed my daughter, <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, when she herself says: I became betrothed, the court <b>does not stone</b> her. The Gemara comments: <b>And Rav Ḥisda follows his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as Rav Ḥisda says</b> that if a father declared: <b>This son of mine is nine years and one day old,</b> or: <b>This daughter of mine is three years and one day old,</b> and the son engaged in intercourse with a woman forbidden to him, or the daughter engaged in intercourse with a man forbidden to her, he is <b>deemed credible</b> concerning his children’s ages <b>with regard to</b> the requirement for the adult to bring <b>an offering</b> if they performed the act unwittingly, <b>but not with regard to</b> their receiving the punishment of <b>lashes and not with regard to</b> other <b>punishments.</b>
The Gemara comments: It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda</b> that if one said: <b>This son of mine is thirteen years and one day old,</b> or: <b>This daughter of mine is twelve years and one day old,</b>

Daf 64a

the father is <b>deemed credible</b> concerning the ages of his children <b>with regard to vows,</b> i.e., any vow they make is valid; <b>and with regard to dedications,</b> i.e., if they consecrate an item by saying it should be dedicated to God; and <b>with regard to consecrations and with regard to valuations,</b> i.e., vows to donate to the Temple treasury the fixed valuation of oneself or others. In all these cases their vows are valid. <b>But</b> the father is <b>not</b> deemed credible <b>with regard to lashes</b> of the court, <b>or with regard to</b> other corporal <b>punishments</b> for transgressions they have committed, as the testimony of one witness, especially that of a family member, is insufficient for this purpose.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a father says: <b>I betrothed my</b> minor <b>daughter</b> to someone, or: <b>I betrothed her</b> to someone <b>and</b> accepted <b>her divorce when she was a minor girl, and she is</b> still <b>a minor girl</b> at the time of this statement, he is <b>deemed credible</b> to render her forbidden to all other men as a married woman, or to a priest as a divorced woman. But if he says: <b>I betrothed her</b> to someone <b>and</b> accepted <b>her divorce when she was a minor, and she is an adult woman</b> at the time of his declaration, his statement is <b>not deemed credible.</b> Likewise, if he says: <b>She was taken captive and I redeemed her, he is not deemed credible</b> to disqualify her from marrying a priest <b>whether she was a minor girl or an adult woman.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna <b>and what is different</b> in <b>the latter clause?</b> Why is the father deemed credible when she is a minor but not when she is an adult or to testify that she was taken captive? The Gemara answers: In <b>the first clause</b> it is still <b>in his power</b> to betroth her, and therefore he is deemed credible when he says that he did so earlier. By contrast, in <b>the latter clause</b> it is <b>not in his power</b> to betroth her, as one cannot betroth his adult daughter. Likewise, as it is not permitted for him to disqualify her by handing her over to a gentile, either when she is a minor or when she is an adult, he is not deemed credible when he says that she was taken captive.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> does a father <b>not</b> have the power to disqualify his daughter? <b>But</b> it is <b>in his power to marry</b> off his minor daughter <b>to a <i>ḥalal</i>,</b> i.e., the son of a priest who married a woman prohibited to him, <b>which</b> thereby <b>disqualifies her from</b> marrying into <b>the priesthood.</b> The father should therefore be deemed credible when he claims that she was taken captive.
The Gemara responds: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as one can say that the mishna <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dostai ben Yehuda, who says: The daughters of Israelites</b> are <b>a ritual bath of purity for individuals of <i>ḥalal</i> status.</b> In other words, an Israelite woman who marries a <i>ḥalal</i> purifies their children, i.e., renders their children fit, in that any daughter born to them is qualified to marry a priest. Similarly, the woman herself does not become disqualified by her intercourse with the <i>ḥalal</i>, and she may marry a priest if her husband dies. If so, a father does not have the power to disqualify his daughter from marrying into the priesthood.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> it is <b>in</b> the father’s <b>power to marry her</b> off <b>to a <i>mamzer</i>,</b> thereby disqualifying her from the priest-hood. The Gemara answers: This <i>tanna</i> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says: Betrothal does not take effect</b> even <b>with</b> those women with whom one <b>is</b> only <b>liable</b> for violating <b>a prohibition</b> of engaging in intercourse and not a more severe prohibition that would render one liable for <i>karet</i> or capital punishment, so betrothal does not take effect with a <i>mamzer</i>.
The Gemara further challenges: <b>But</b> it is <b>in</b> the father’s <b>power to marry her</b> off as <b>a widow to a High Priest, and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Simai, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Simai says: In all</b> cases <b>Rabbi Akiva deems</b> the child <b>a <i>mamzer</i>,</b> i.e., he considers the offspring of all forbidden acts of intercourse to be <i>mamzerim</i>, <b>apart from a widow to a High Priest, as the Torah stated</b> with regard to a High Priest: “A widow…<b>shall he not take…and he shall not profane [<i>yeḥallel</i>]</b> his seed” (Leviticus 21:14–15). From this verse it is derived: <b>He renders</b> his children <b><i>ḥalalim</i></b> by means of this relationship, <b>but he does not render</b> them <b><i>mamzerim</i>.</b> Since this act of intercourse does not produce <i>mamzerim</i>, Rabbi Akiva agrees that betrothal is effective in this case.
The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yeshevav, who says: Come, let us shout at Akiva ben Yosef, who would say:</b> In <b>every</b> case where <b>a Jew may not engage in intercourse</b> with a particular woman, and he does so, <b>the offspring</b> that results from this union <b>is a <i>mamzer</i>.</b> This indicates that according to Rabbi Akiva all acts of forbidden intercourse produce <i>mamzerim</i>. Consequently, betrothal is of no effect in the case of any prohibition, including a widow to a High Priest, which means that a father cannot disqualify his daughter from the priesthood.
The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> mishna can <b>work out well</b> even <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yeshevav if</b> he states <b>a reasoning of his own,</b> i.e., he states an independent statement critical of Rabbi Akiva’s ruling that the child of any illicit union is a <i>mamzer</i>. Then, the ruling of the mishna is <b>well,</b> as it is a categorical statement that applies to all illicit unions. <b>But if he comes to exclude the reason of Rabbi Simai,</b> i.e., he means to take issue with the ruling of Rabbi Akiva in the specific case mentioned by Rabbi Simai, that of a widow to a High Priest, then Rabbi Yeshevav too concedes that according to the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, betrothal does take effect in a case where a positive mitzva is violated by the betrothal. Accordingly, it is <b>in</b> the father’s <b>power to marry her to those</b> with whom intercourse renders them <b>liable for</b> the violation of <b>positive</b> mitzvot, as Rabbi Akiva’s principle does not include cases of this kind.
<b>Rav Ashi says: And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> it that way? Can it be that the reason for the <i>halakha</i> in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna <b>is because</b> it is <b>in his power? Although</b> it is <b>in his power to betroth her,</b> is it <b>in his power to divorce her? And furthermore, if this one,</b> the prospective husband, <b>says that</b> it is <b>not satisfactory</b> for him <b>to</b> betroth <b>her, can</b> her father <b>betroth her to him against his will?</b> A father cannot betroth his daughter to whomever he chooses without taking the man’s wishes into account.
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi says:</b> In <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna, the reason is that <b>the Merciful One believes him, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, as Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says: From where</b> is it derived that <b>a father is deemed credible to render his daughter forbidden</b> as a betrothed woman <b>by Torah law? As it is stated: “I gave my daughter to this man [<i>la’ish hazzeh</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:16). When the father said that he married her <b>to “the man [<i>la’ish</i>],” he rendered her forbidden</b> to all men. When he then said <b>“this [<i>hazzeh</i>],” he rendered her permitted</b> to this specific man, her husband.
Rav Ashi explains the ruling of the mishna: <b>The Merciful One deems the father credible with regard to marriage,</b> whereas He <b>does not deem him credible with regard to a captive.</b> The Torah did not grant a father any special credibility with regard to the claim that his daughter was taken captive.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who said at the time of his death: I have children,</b> in which case his wife does not require levirate marriage after his death, he is <b>deemed credible.</b> But if he said on his deathbed: <b>I have brothers,</b> indicating that it is prohibited for her to marry anyone else until one of his brothers performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with her after his death, he is <b>not deemed credible.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Apparently,</b> one can infer from the mishna that a husband <b>is deemed credible to render</b> his wife <b>permitted but he is not deemed credible to render</b> her <b>forbidden.</b> The Gemara suggests: Shall <b>we say</b> that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan?</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If someone <b>said at the time of</b> his <b>betrothal</b> that <b>he has children,</b> but <b>at the time of</b> his <b>death he said</b> that <b>he does not have children;</b> or if he <b>said at the time of betrothal</b> that <b>he does not have brothers,</b> and <b>at the time of death he said he has brothers,</b> in both cases he is <b>deemed credible to render</b> her <b>permitted,</b> i.e., to release her from the obligation of levirate marriage on the basis of his first statement, <b>but he is not deemed credible to render</b> her <b>forbidden</b> based on his last claim. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> He is <b>deemed credible even to render</b> her <b>forbidden.</b>
<b>Rava says: There,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>it is different, since at the time of</b> his <b>death he retracted</b> his initial statement. Therefore, one can <b>say</b> that it is likely that <b>he spoke the truth.</b> In general, however, he is not deemed credible to render her forbidden. <b>Abaye said to him: And isn’t it all the more so</b> that he should be deemed credible in this case? Abaye elaborates: <b>Now</b> consider, <b>if there, where</b> he <b>weakens his</b> previous <b>statement,</b> as he now says the opposite of his earlier claim, nevertheless <b>you say</b> that <b>he spoke the truth,</b> in the case of <b>the mishna, where</b> he <b>does not weaken his</b> earlier <b>statement,</b> as he had issued no prior claim about having or lacking children or brothers, <b>is it not all the more so</b> that he should be deemed credible?
<b>Rather, Abaye said: The mishna</b> is referring to a case <b>where we</b> do not <b>have a presumptive status with regard to</b> possible <b>brothers</b> of his, <b>and</b> likewise <b>we</b> do <b>not have a presumptive status with regard to</b> his <b>children.</b> The court has no prior knowledge as to whether the dying man has brothers or children. <b>As we say: Since we</b> do <b>not</b> have <b>presumptive status with regard to either children or brothers,</b> if <b>he said: I have children,</b> he is <b>deemed credible,</b> whereas if he said: <b>I have brothers,</b> he is <b>not deemed credible.</b> Why? <b>It is not in his</b> power <b>to render her forbidden to everyone,</b> counter to the presumption that he has no brothers. By contrast, the <b><i>baraita</i></b> is referring to

Daf 64b

a case <b>where we have a presumptive status that</b> he has <b>brothers, but we do not have a presumptive status that</b> he has <b>children,</b> although no full-fledged testimony has been submitted for either claim. <b>As</b> in that case <b>we say</b> and apply the logic of: <b>Why would I lie?</b> In other words, if he were lying he would have stated a more credible claim or performed an action achieving the desired result. The Gemara explains: For <b>what</b> reason <b>is he saying</b> that he has children or that he has no brothers, if not <b>to exempt her from a <i>yavam</i>?</b> But if so, <b>he can say</b> to her instead: <b>I exempt you by</b> means of <b>a bill of divorce.</b> Consequently, it can be assumed that he is telling the truth when he says that he has children.
In light of the above explanation, the Gemara clarifies the dispute in the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>maintains</b> that the claim of: <b>Why would I lie,</b> is <b>considered like</b> the testimony of <b>witnesses, and witnesses</b> can <b>come and uproot a presumption.</b> Therefore, he does not have the power to contradict his previous claim and say that he has no children and render her forbidden at the time of his death. <b>And Rabbi Natan maintains</b> that: <b>Why would I lie,</b> is <b>considered like a presumption,</b> and <b>a presumption cannot come and uproot</b> another <b>presumption entirely.</b> As a result, he is deemed credible even for the purpose of rendering her forbidden, i.e., if he says at the time of his death that he has no children, the earlier presumption that he had brothers, but no children, is reinstated.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who betroths his daughter</b> to a man <b>without specification,</b> i.e., without specifying which daughter he meant, <b>the grown women are not included</b> among those who might be betrothed, since he does not have the right to betroth them. With regard to <b>one who has two groups</b> of <b>daughters from two women,</b> i.e., one group of daughters from each wife, <b>and he said: I betrothed my elder daughter</b> to someone <b>but I do not know if</b> I meant <b>the eldest of the older</b> group of daughters, <b>or the eldest of the younger</b> group of daughters, <b>or the youngest of the older</b> group, <b>who is</b> nevertheless <b>older than the eldest of the younger</b> group, <b>all</b> the daughters <b>are forbidden, except for the youngest of the younger</b> group. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> Despite the uncertainty, <b>they are all permitted except for the eldest of the older</b> group, as one who says elder without further specification means the oldest of them all.
Similarly, if one said: <b>I betrothed my younger daughter, but I do not know if</b> I meant <b>the youngest of the younger</b> group, <b>or the youngest of the older</b> group, <b>or the eldest of the younger</b> group <b>who is younger than the youngest of the older</b> group, <b>they are all forbidden, except for the eldest of the older</b> group. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei says: They are all permitted except for the youngest of the younger</b> group.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: From the ruling of the mishna, that one who betroths his daughter without further specification certainly did not betroth an adult daughter, it may be inferred that all <b>minor girls are included</b> in the uncertainty if he had more than one.
One can <b>learn from</b> the mishna <b>that betrothal that is not given to consummation,</b> i.e., where the husband may not consummate the marriage, in this case because each of the women might not be his wife but his wife’s sister, <b>is</b> nevertheless considered <b>betrothal</b> to the extent that each of the women requires a bill of divorce to render her permitted to marry someone else. This contradicts the opinion of Rava that betrothal that is not given to consummation does not take effect at all. The Gemara rejects this: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case in <b>which there are only</b> two daughters, <b>an adult woman and a minor girl.</b>
The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>But</b> the mishna <b>teaches: Grown women,</b> in the plural. The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>grown women?</b> The mishna is not referring to a father who has more than one adult daughter. Rather, it means <b>grown women in general.</b> In other words, whenever men betroth one of their daughters, their daughters who are grown women are not under consideration.
The Gemara asks a different question: This <i>halakha</i> <b>is obvious,</b> as <b>what are grown women doing</b> in this context, i.e., how could it be suggested that a father could betroth to a man his daughter who is a grown woman? His authority extends only to his minor daughters. The Gemara answers: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the adult daughter <b>appointed</b> her father as her <b>agent</b> to accept her betrothal, and he proceeds to betroth one of his daughters without specifying which one. <b>Lest you say</b> with regard to this situation that <b>when</b> he <b>accepts</b> the <b>betrothal he accepts</b> it <b>with</b> his adult daughter <b>in mind,</b> as he is her agent, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that <b>a person does not put aside a matter from which he derives benefit,</b> i.e., the betrothal of his minor daughter, where he keeps the money, <b>and perform a matter from which he does not derive benefit,</b> i.e., the betrothal of his adult daughter, where she keeps the money.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Are we not dealing</b> even with a case <b>where</b> the daughter <b>says to him:</b> As reward for fulfilling your agency, <b>my betrothal</b> money shall belong <b>to you?</b> This would mean that the father derives benefit from the betrothal of his adult daughter as well. The Gemara counters: <b>Even so, a person does not put aside a mitzva that is imposed upon him,</b> i.e., the betrothal of his minor daughter, <b>to perform a mitzva that is not</b> directly <b>imposed upon him,</b> the betrothal of his adult daughter. Since she is of age, her betrothal is her own responsibility.
§ The mishna taught: With regard to <b>one who has two groups of daughters</b> and betrothed the elder of them, but was unsure which one he meant, Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei dispute which of them is betrothed. The mishna adds that the same dispute applies if he betrothed his younger daughter. The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> in both cases, <b>as had</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> only that the <i>tanna’im</i> disagree with regard to the <b>first</b> case, one might have claimed that <b>in this</b> case <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that they are all prohibited except for the youngest daughter of the younger group. The reason is <b>that since there is one younger than her,</b> he <b>calls any</b> daughter who is not the youngest: <b>Elder.</b>
<b>But in this</b> case of one who betroths his younger daughter, <b>say</b> that <b>he concedes to Rabbi Yosei</b> that a father <b>calls</b> only <b>that</b> one who is the <b>youngest of all: Younger,</b> as a father prefers to call his daughters: Elder, whenever possible. <b>And</b> conversely, <b>if</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>was stated</b> only <b>with regard to this</b> case, that of a younger daughter, one might have said that <b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> his opinion only in <b>this</b> case, for the above reason. <b>But in that</b> case of an elder daughter, you might <b>say</b> that <b>he concedes to Rabbi Meir.</b> Consequently, it is <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to specify both cases.
The Gemara asks a question with regard to these opinions: <b>Is this to say that Rabbi Meir maintains: A person places himself in</b> a situation of <b>uncertainty,</b> i.e., people issue statements and accept upon themselves obligations that are not clearly defined, <b>and Rabbi Yosei maintains</b> that <b>a person does not place himself in</b> a situation of <b>uncertainty,</b> as one has only well-defined situations in mind? <b>But haven’t we learned</b> that these two <i>tanna’im</i> state <b>the opposite</b> opinions, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nedarim</i> 60a): If <b>one takes a vow</b> that wine is forbidden to him <b>until Passover, it is forbidden</b> to him <b>until</b> Passover <b>arrives.</b> If he said: <b>Until it will be</b> Passover, <b>it is forbidden</b> to him <b>until</b> Passover <b>ends.</b>
The mishna continues: If he said: <b>Until before Passover, Rabbi Meir says:</b> It is <b>forbidden</b> to him <b>until</b> Passover <b>arrives. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> It is forbidden to him <b>until it ends.</b> This indicates that Rabbi Meir holds that one does not put himself into a situation of uncertainty, as despite his mention of the presence of Passover, which might be referring to any of the days of the Festival, he does not mean one of the days of Passover itself but until the arrival of the Festival, whereas Rabbi Yosei claims that his words apply to each of the days of Passover, due to uncertainty. This is the opposite of the above interpretation of the mishna concerning a man who betroths his daughter.
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Avdimi says</b> that <b>Rav says: The</b> attribution of the <b>opinions is reversed,</b> i.e., the rulings of the respective <i>tanna’im</i> in that mishna in <i>Nedarim</i> must be switched so that they accord with the mishna here. <b>And it is taught</b> likewise in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>this is the principle:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> vow <b>that has a fixed time,</b> i.e., it applies until a set date, <b>and one said: Until before</b> that date, <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that the vow lasts <b>until</b> that date <b>ends; Rabbi Yosei says: Until it arrives.</b> The opinions in this <i>baraita</i> are in accordance with the suggested emendation.
<b>Abaye said:</b> This <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei applies <b>to two groups of girls,</b> as Rabbi Meir maintains that all of them can be called: Elder, except for the youngest of the younger group. <b>But with regard to one group,</b> i.e., if all the daughters share the same mother, <b>everyone agrees</b> that when the father says: Elder, he means the <b>actual eldest</b> one, and when he says: Younger, he means the <b>actual youngest</b> daughter. As for the <b>middle</b> daughter, she is called neither elder nor younger; rather, <b>he calls her by her name.</b>
<b>Rav Adda bar Mattana said to Abaye: If that is so,</b>

Daf 65a

with regard to one who said: I betrothed my elder daughter, <b>the middle</b> daughter <b>of the</b> younger <b>second group should be permitted,</b> as he would have called her by name rather than referring to her as: The elder one. The Gemara answers: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where there are only</b> two daughters, <b>an adult woman and a minor girl,</b> but no middle daughter.
The Gemara adds: <b>And so too, it is reasonable</b> that this is the case, <b>as, if it is so, that there is</b> a middle daughter, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> its <i>halakha</i> with a direct reference to <b>her</b> as well, as the uncertainty also applies to this daughter. In other words, the mishna should have stated: And I do not know if it was the middle of the younger group of daughters. The fact that the mishna does not refer to this daughter indicates that there are only two women in each group. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>But according to your reasoning, the middle one of the first group is definitely</b> included in the <b>uncertainty and is forbidden to</b> the prospective husband, and yet <b>does</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> its <i>halakha</i> with a direct reference to <b>her?</b>
The Gemara questions this argument: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There it taught</b> its <i>halakha</i> with a direct reference to a daughter who is <b>younger than</b> the middle daughter of the older group, and that daughter is mentioned <b>for a prohibition,</b> as the mishna states that the uncertainty applies even to the youngest of the older group; <b>and</b> if so, <b>the same is true of this</b> middle daughter, <b>who is older than</b> the youngest of the older group, i.e., it is evident that the same uncertainty applies to her, and therefore there is no reason to mention the middle daughter of the older group.
Conversely, <b>here,</b> with regard to the younger group, <b>if it is so that there is</b> uncertainty with regard to the middle daughter and she is forbidden, the mishna <b>should teach</b> its <i>halakha</i> with a direct reference to <b>her,</b> as one might think she is excluded from the uncertainty because she is not the eldest. Consequently, the fact that the mishna omits all reference to the middle daughter from the second group proves that the second wife has only two daughters.
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said to Rava:</b> But there is the case of <b>Passover, which is comparable to one group</b> of daughters, as all the days of the Festival are part of a single group, <b>and</b> yet Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei <b>disagree</b> with regard to it. This apparently contradicts Abaye’s opinion that everyone agrees in the case of a single group.
Rava <b>said to him: There they disagree with regard to the general</b> usage of <b>language.</b> In other words, their dispute in that case does not concern the basic issue of whether or not one places himself in a position of uncertainty. Rather, they disagree over the way people speak. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yosei, <b>holds</b> that the phrase: <b>Until before Passover,</b> means: <b>Until</b> just <b>before Passover, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that it means <b>until Passover passes</b> and ends.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who says to a woman: I betrothed you, and she says: You did not betroth me, he is forbidden to her relatives,</b> as his claim that he has betrothed her renders himself forbidden to her relatives. <b>And she is permitted to his relatives,</b> in accordance with her stance that she is not betrothed to him. If <b>she says: You betrothed me, and he says: I did not betroth you, he is permitted to her relatives and she is forbidden to his relatives</b> by the same reasoning.
If a man says to a woman: <b>I betrothed you, and she says: You betrothed only my daughter, he is forbidden to the relatives of the older</b> woman, the mother, whom he claims to have betrothed, <b>and the older</b> woman <b>is permitted to his relatives. He is permitted to the relatives of the younger</b> woman, the daughter, as he maintains that he did not betroth her, <b>and the younger</b> woman <b>is permitted to his relatives,</b> since her mother’s statement is insufficient to render her forbidden.
Similarly, if he says: <b>I betrothed your daughter, and she,</b> the mother, <b>says: You betrothed only me, he is forbidden to the relatives of the younger</b> woman, <b>and the younger</b> woman <b>is permitted to his relatives; he is permitted to the relatives of the older</b> woman, <b>and the older</b> woman <b>is forbidden to his relatives.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna taught that with regard to <b>one who says to a woman: I betrothed you,</b> and she denies his claim, he is forbidden to her relatives while she remains permitted to his. The mishna then provides several examples illustrating the same principle. The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to specify all these cases. The Gemara elaborates: <b>As, had</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> the <i>halakha</i> only <b>with regard to himself,</b> i.e., the case where he claims to have betrothed the woman, one might have said that he is not deemed credible at all, <b>because a man does not care</b> if <b>he happens to say</b> that he betrothed a woman even if he did not do so, as he can betroth another woman.
<b>But</b> in a case where <b>she</b> claims to have been betrothed by him, one might <b>say</b> that <b>if her statement was not certain to her she would not have said</b> it. Since her claim that he betrothed her renders her forbidden to everyone else, it is likely that it is true, <b>and</b> therefore one might think that <b>he should</b> also <b>be forbidden to her relatives</b> on the basis of this assumption. The mishna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case.
Likewise, with regard to one who says: <b>I betrothed you, and she says:</b> You betrothed only my daughter, in which case he is forbidden to her relatives but she is permitted to his, the Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>this as well?</b> The principle has already been established. The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary</b> to state this case too, as it might <b>enter your mind to say:</b> Since <b>by Torah law, the Merciful One deems credible a father</b> who claims to have betrothed his daughter to a particular person, perhaps the Sages <b>deem</b> a mother <b>credible by rabbinic law, and</b> therefore <b>her daughter should be forbidden</b> based <b>on her statement.</b> The mishna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that a mother is not believed with regard to her daughter.
The Gemara continues this line of questioning. With regard to the case where a man says: <b>I betrothed your daughter,</b> and she replies: You betrothed only me, <b>why do I</b> need <b>this as well?</b> What novelty is taught in this case? The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the mishna <b>taught this</b> other case, of a man claiming he betrothed a woman and the woman replying that it was her daughter, <b>it also taught this</b> last case, so that it mentions all the permutations, despite the fact that this particular case provides no novelty.
§ <b>It was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disagreed over how the court should proceed in practice with regard to the cases described in the mishna. <b>Rav says:</b> The court <b>forces</b> the man to give her a bill of divorce, <b>and Shmuel says:</b> The court <b>requests</b> that he give a bill of divorce. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to which</b> case of the mishna is this referring? <b>If we say</b> it is referring <b>to the first clause,</b> where he says: I betrothed you, and she replies: You did not betroth me, <b>no</b> ruling of: The court <b>forces, is</b> relevant here, <b>nor is</b> the ruling: The court <b>requests,</b> relevant. Since she is permitted to marry even his relatives, she is certainly permitted to marry anyone else. Why, then, would it be necessary for him to give her a bill of divorce? <b>Rather,</b> the dispute applies <b>to the latter clause</b> of the mishna, where he denies her claim that he betrothed her. To allow her to marry somebody else, the court either forces or requests of him to give her a bill of divorce.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> according to the opinion that the court <b>requests</b> that he give a bill of divorce, <b>it is well.</b> Since she has rendered herself forbidden to everyone, one can ask him to release her. <b>But why</b> should the court <b>force</b> him to issue a bill of divorce? Can’t he <b>say: It is not satisfactory for me to be forbidden to her relatives?</b> His giving her a bill of divorce is an admission that he betrothed her, which means that he may not marry her relatives.
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara offers a different explanation: These <b><i>halakhot</i> were stated together,</b> as follows: <b>Shmuel says</b> that the court <b>requests of him to give a bill of divorce. Rav says: If he gave a bill of divorce of his own accord,</b> without being asked to do so but merely in response to her claim, the court <b>forces him to give</b> her payment for her <b>marriage contract</b> as well. By giving her a bill of divorce of his own volition, he has effectively admitted that he betrothed her, despite the fact that he has not said so explicitly. Consequently, he must also provide her with payment for her marriage contract.
<b>It was also stated: Rav Aḥa bar Adda says</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say Rav Aḥa bar Adda says</b> that <b>Rav Hamnuna says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The court <b>forces</b> him <b>and requests</b> of him. The Gemara expresses puzzlement at this statement: How can these <b>two</b> statements be reconciled? Rather, it must be that <b>this is</b> what Rav Aḥa bar Adda <b>is saying:</b> The court <b>requests of him to give a bill of divorce, and if he gave a bill of divorce of his own accord</b> the court <b>forces him to give</b> her payment for <b>her marriage contract.</b>
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>one who betroths</b> another <b>with,</b> i.e., in the presence of, <b>one witness, one</b> need <b>not be concerned that his betrothal</b> has taken effect. The students <b>raised a dilemma before Rav Yehuda:</b> If <b>both</b> the man and the woman <b>concede</b> that it was a betrothal, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is the betrothal valid? Rav Yehuda did not provide a clear answer. He said: <b>Yes and no, and</b> the matter was <b>uncertain to him. It was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> discussed this point. <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with one witness, one</b> need <b>not be concerned that his betrothal</b> has taken effect, <b>and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even if both</b> parties <b>concede</b> that there was a betrothal.
<b>Rava raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> from the mishna: With regard to <b>one who says to a woman: I betrothed you, and she says: You did not betroth me, he is forbidden to her relatives and she is permitted to his relatives.</b> Rava proceeds to analyze the exact circumstances of this case. <b>If</b> the case is one <b>where there are witnesses, why</b> is <b>she permitted to his relatives?</b> It is a full-fledged betrothal performed in the presence of witnesses. <b>And if there are no witnesses</b> at all, <b>why</b> is <b>he forbidden to her relatives</b> without any testimony to that effect? <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring <b>to</b> a case where there was <b>one witness?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where he said to her: I betrothed you in the presence of so-and-so and so-and-so,</b> i.e., there were two witnesses, <b>but they went overseas</b> and there is no way of clarifying what really occurred. Consequently, there are only the conflicting accounts of the man and woman, and therefore he is prohibited from marrying her relatives while she is permitted to marry his.
Rava <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of Rav Naḥman from a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 4:7): If <b>one divorces his wife, and she</b> subsequently <b>lodged with him in an inn, Beit Shammai say: She does not require a second bill of divorce from him, and Beit Hillel say: She requires a second bill of divorce from him.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If there are witnesses</b> who saw them engage in sexual inter-course for the purpose of betrothal, <b>what is the reason that Beit Shammai</b> do not require a second bill of divorce? <b>If there are no witnesses, what is the reason that Beit Hillel</b> require a second bill of divorce? <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring <b>to</b> a case where there was <b>one witness</b> who saw them engage in intercourse for the purpose of betrothal?
Rav Naḥman responds: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> that there was one witness, <b>say the latter clause</b> of that mishna: <b>And</b> Beit Hillel <b>concede with regard to</b> a woman <b>who was divorced after betrothal that she does not require a second bill of divorce from him, due to</b> the fact that <b>he is not accustomed to her.</b> Since he had not previously been intimate with her, there is no concern that they engaged in intercourse, even though they lodged together at the inn. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>one witness is deemed credible</b> in this case, <b>what</b> difference is it <b>to me</b> whether it was <b>after</b> her <b>betrothal,</b> and <b>what</b> difference is it <b>to me</b> if it occurred <b>after</b> her <b>marriage?</b>
<b>Rather,</b> it is clear that the mishna is not referring to when there is one witness, and <b>here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where there are witnesses to</b> their <b>seclusion, but there are no witnesses to</b> their engaging in <b>intercourse.</b> The dispute is based on the implications of this seclusion. <b>Beit Shammai hold:</b> One does <b>not</b>

Daf 65b

<b>say: These are the witnesses of seclusion, these are the witnesses of intercourse.</b> According to Beit Shammai, although there are witnesses that they were secluded, this is not considered to be tantamount to testimony that they engaged in intercourse. <b>And Beit Hillel hold: We</b> do <b>say</b> that <b>these are the witnesses of seclusion, these are the witnesses of intercourse.</b> Since it is assumed that they engaged in intercourse, she is required to obtain a second bill of divorce from him. <b>And</b> Beit Hillel <b>concede</b> to Beit Shammai that <b>certainly in</b> the case of a woman <b>divorced from betrothal, that we do not say</b> that <b>these are the witnesses of seclusion, these are the witnesses of intercourse, because he is not accustomed to her.</b>
<b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta says in the name of Rav:</b> With regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with one witness, one</b> need <b>not be concerned that his betrothal</b> has taken effect, <b>and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even if</b> the man and woman <b>both concede</b> that there was a betrothal. <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna says:</b> With regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with one witness, the Great Court says</b> that <b>one</b> need <b>not be concerned that his betrothal</b> has taken effect. The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is <b>the Great Court? Rav. And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of this discussion. <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> With regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with one witness, the Great Court says</b> that <b>one</b> need <b>not be concerned that his betrothal</b> has taken effect. <b>Who</b> is <b>the Great Court? Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
<b>Rav Aḥadvoi bar Ami raises an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: There were <b>two</b> men <b>who came from overseas and a woman</b> was <b>with them, and</b> they had <b>a bundle with them. This</b> man <b>says: This is my wife, and this</b> other man is <b>my slave, and this is my bundle. And this</b> second man <b>says: This is my wife, and this</b> other man is <b>my slave, and this is my bundle. And the woman says: These are my two slaves and this is my bundle.</b> In this case <b>she requires two bills of divorce,</b> as with each of them there is uncertainty concerning whether she is married to him, <b>and she collects</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract from the bundle.</b> Even according to their claims that she is married to one of them, now that they have each divorced her she is at least entitled to payment of her marriage contract from the bundle.
Rav Aḥadvoi’s objection is as follows: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where this</b> man <b>has</b> two <b>witnesses</b> supporting his claim <b>and that</b> man <b>has</b> two <b>witnesses</b> supporting his claim, <b>can</b> the woman <b>say: These are my two slaves, and this is my bundle?</b> After all, there are two witnesses that one of the men is her husband. <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring <b>to</b> a case where each of the men has only <b>one witness?</b> This proves that a betrothal performed in the presence of a single witness is effective, as she requires a bill of divorce from each of them.
The Gemara rejects this opinion: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> it that way? In a situation involving <b>one witness in</b> the face of <b>contradicting</b> testimony, as in the case here, where another witness claims she is betrothed to the second man, <b>is</b> a single witness <b>deemed credible</b> at all? <b>Rather,</b> one must understand this case as follows: <b>Everyone agrees that</b> with regard to <b>permitting</b> her <b>to</b> marry <b>all</b> other people, she is <b>permitted</b> even without a bill of divorce.
<b>And here, this is</b> what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: She requires two bills of divorce in order to collect</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract from the bundle. And</b> this ruling <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says:</b> Even <b>movable property,</b> not only land, <b>is subject to a lien for</b> payment of <b>a marriage contract.</b> Consequently, to collect from this bundle, which has three claimants, the woman must receive a bill of divorce from both men, thereby obligating them to give her payment of a marriage contract.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> the case of one who betroths another in the presence of one witness? <b>Rav Kahana said: One</b> need <b>not</b> be <b>concerned that his betrothal</b> has taken effect. <b>Rav Pappa said: One</b> need <b>be concerned that his betrothal</b> has taken effect. <b>Rav Ashi said to Rav Kahana: What is your opinion</b> that leads you to claim that there is no concern that his betrothal has taken effect? It must be <b>that you derive</b> it by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the word <b>“matter”</b> written with regard to forbidden sexual intercourse and the word <b>matter</b> written with regard to <b>monetary matters.</b> The Torah states concerning one who desires to divorce his wife: “Because he has found some unseemly matter in her” (Deuteronomy 24:1), a reference to adulterous intercourse, and with regard to monetary matters it states: “At the mouths of two witnesses, or at the mouths of three witnesses, shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15).
Rav Ashi asks: But <b>if</b> so, <b>just as there,</b> with regard to monetary matters, the legal status of <b>the admission of a litigant is similar to</b> that of <b>one hundred witnesses</b> and it renders him liable, <b>so too here, the admission of a litigant</b> should be <b>similar to</b> that of <b>one hundred witnesses.</b> This would mean that if the man and woman both admit to the betrothal, they should be liable to bear the consequences of this claim. Rav Kahana <b>said to him:</b> There is a difference between the two cases. <b>There,</b> with regard to one who admits that he owes money, he <b>does not</b> act <b>to the detriment of another,</b> whereas <b>here, he</b> acts <b>to the detriment of another,</b> as their confessions render them forbidden to each other’s relatives, which means that their claims affect others as well.
The Gemara relates: <b>Mar Zutra and Rav Adda the Elder, the sons of Rav Mari bar Issur, divided their</b> shared <b>property between them. They came before Rav Ashi</b> and <b>said to him</b> that they had the following dilemma. <b>The Merciful One states: “At the mouths of two witnesses,</b> or at the mouths of three witnesses, shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15). Why do we say that two witnesses are required? So <b>that if</b> the parties involved <b>wish to retract</b> from their agreement and say that it never happened, <b>they cannot retract</b> from their agreement. <b>And</b> as <b>we will not retract</b> from our agreement, we do not require witnesses to establish our division of the property.
<b>Or perhaps the matter is established only through witnesses.</b> In other words, perhaps the witnesses do not merely provide proof that the division occurred, but they are a constitutive factor in its establishment from a legal perspective. Rav Ashi <b>said to them: Witnesses were created only for liars,</b> and they are not needed to establish the matter. If no one denies the transaction, it remains in effect.
§ With regard to a related issue, <b>Abaye says:</b> If <b>one witness says to</b> someone: <b>You ate</b> forbidden <b>fat, and that one,</b> the subject of the testimony, remains <b>silent</b> and does not deny it, the witness is <b>deemed credible</b> and the person in question must bring a sin-offering for his sin. <b>And the <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna also <b>taught</b> (<i>Karetot</i> 11b): If <b>one witness said to</b> someone: <b>You ate</b> forbidden <b>fat, and that</b> person <b>says: I did not eat</b> it, he is <b>exempt</b> from bringing an offering. One can infer from this that <b>the reason</b> he is exempt is only <b>because he said</b> definitively: I did <b>not</b> eat, which indicates that <b>if he was silent,</b> the witness is <b>deemed credible.</b>
<b>And Abaye says</b> that <b>if one witness says to</b> someone: <b>Your ritually pure</b> food <b>was rendered impure, and that</b> person remained <b>silent,</b> the witness is <b>deemed credible. And the <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna also <b>taught</b> (<i>Karetot</i> 12a): If <b>one witness said</b> to someone: Your ritually pure food <b>was rendered impure, and that</b> person <b>says: It was not rendered impure, he is exempt. The reason</b> he is exempt is only <b>because he said</b> definitively that his food was <b>not</b> rendered ritually impure, which indicates that <b>if he was silent,</b> the witness is <b>deemed credible.</b>
<b>And Abaye</b> further <b>says</b> that <b>if one witness says to</b> someone:

Daf 66a

<b>Your ox was used</b> by a man <b>for an act of bestiality</b> and is therefore unfit for an offering, <b>and the other,</b> the owner of the ox, <b>is silent,</b> the witness is <b>deemed credible. And the <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna also <b>taught</b> (<i>Bekhorot</i> 41a): <b>And</b> with regard to an animal <b>that was used for a transgression</b> or <b>that killed,</b> if this is attested to <b>by one witness or by the owner,</b> he is <b>deemed credible.</b> The Gemara clarifies this case: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>this</b> case of the mishna, where the knowledge is established <b>by one witness? If the owner admits</b> to the claim, <b>this is</b> the same as: <b>By the owner. Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> the owner remains <b>silent?</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> each of these statements of Abaye is <b>necessary. As, had he taught us</b> only <b>that first</b> case, where the witness said someone ate forbidden fat, one might have said that he is deemed credible for the following reason: <b>Were it not</b> for the fact <b>that he himself</b> was <b>convinced that he had committed</b> a transgression, <b>he would not</b> commit the transgression of <b>bringing a non-sacred</b> animal <b>to</b> the Temple <b>courtyard</b> on the basis of the testimony of one witness. Consequently, his silence is evidently an admission.
<b>But</b> if the witness said: <b>Your ritually pure</b> foods <b>were rendered ritually impure,</b> and the accused was silent, <b>we would say:</b> The reason <b>that</b> he is <b>silent</b> and refrains from denying the claim is <b>that he thinks</b> he is not suffering any significant loss, as the food <b>is fit for him</b> to eat <b>on his days of ritual impurity,</b> because he is not required to destroy ritually impure foods.
<b>And had</b> Abaye <b>taught us</b> only the case of: Your ritually pure food was rendered ritually impure, one might have said that the reason <b>this</b> witness is deemed credible is <b>that he causes him a loss on his days of ritual impurity,</b> and therefore his silence is tantamount to a confession. <b>But</b> in the case of: <b>His ox was used</b> by a man <b>for an act of bestiality,</b> the owner of the ox <b>can say</b> with regard to his animal: <b>Not all the oxen stand</b> ready to be sacrificed <b>as</b> an offering on the <b>altar.</b> Perhaps one would think that the owner does not bother denying the claim because he merely forfeits the possibility of sacrificing his ox as an offering, which he considers an inconsequential matter. It is only if there were two witnesses to the act that the animal is put to death, whereas here there was only one witness. It is therefore <b>necessary</b> for Abaye to specify all these cases.
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If a husband is told <b>by one witness</b> that <b>his wife committed adultery, and</b> the husband remains <b>silent, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Abaye said:</b> The witness is <b>deemed credible. Rava said: He is not deemed credible.</b> Why not? Because <b>it is a matter involving forbidden relations, and there is no matter</b> of testimony <b>for forbidden sexual relations</b> that can be attested to by <b>fewer than two</b> witnesses.
<b>Abaye said: From where do I say</b> this claim of mine? It happened <b>that</b> there was <b>a certain blind man who would review <i>mishnayot</i> before Mar Shmuel. One day</b> the blind man <b>was late for him and was not arriving.</b> Mar Shmuel <b>sent a messenger after him</b> to assist him. <b>While</b> the <b>messenger was going</b> to the blind man’s house <b>by one way,</b> the blind man <b>arrived</b> at the house of study <b>by a different</b> route, and therefore the messenger missed him and reached his house. <b>When</b> the <b>messenger came</b> back, <b>he said</b> that he had been to the blind man’s house and saw that <b>his wife committed adultery.</b> The blind man <b>came before Mar Shmuel</b> to inquire whether he must pay heed to this testimony. Mar Shmuel <b>said to him: If</b> this messenger <b>is trusted by you, go</b> and <b>divorce her, but if not, do not divorce</b> her.
Abaye comments: <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that this means that <b>if he is trusted by you that he is not a thief</b> but is a valid witness, you must rely on him? This would prove that a single witness can testify in a case of this kind. <b>And Rava</b> explains that Mar Shmuel meant: <b>If</b> he <b>is trusted by you like two</b> witnesses, <b>go</b> and <b>divorce her, but if not, do not divorce</b> her. Consequently, Rava maintains that this episode affords no proof.
<b>And Abaye said: From where do I say</b> this claim of mine? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>An incident</b> occurred <b>with King Yannai, who went to</b> the region of <b>Koḥalit in the desert and conquered sixty cities there. And upon his return he rejoiced</b> with <b>a great happiness</b> over his victory. <b>And he</b> subsequently <b>summoned all the Sages of the Jewish people</b> and <b>said to them: Our ancestors</b> in their poverty <b>would eat salty foods when they were busy with the building of the Temple; we too shall eat salty foods in memory of our ancestors. And they brought salty food on tables of gold, and ate.</b>
<b>And there was one</b> person <b>present, a scoffer,</b> a man of <b>an evil heart and a scoundrel called Elazar ben Po’ira. And Elazar ben Po’ira said to King Yannai: King Yannai, the hearts of the Pharisees,</b> the Sages, <b>are against you.</b> In other words, they harbor secret resentment against you and do not like you. The king replied: <b>And what shall I do</b> to clarify this matter? Elazar responded: <b>Have them stand by</b> wearing <b>the frontplate between your eyes.</b> Since the frontplate bears the Divine Name, they should stand in its honor. Yannai, who was a member of the priestly Hasmonean family, also served as High Priest, who wears the frontplate. <b>He had</b> the Pharisees <b>stand by</b> wearing <b>the frontplate between his eyes.</b>
Now <b>there was a certain elder present called Yehuda ben Gedidya, and Yehuda ben Gedidya said to King Yannai: King Yannai, the crown of the monarchy suffices for you,</b> i.e., you should be satisfied that you are king. <b>Leave the crown of the priesthood for the descendants of Aaron.</b> The Gemara explains this last comment: <b>As they would say</b> that Yannai’s <b>mother was taken captive in Modi’in,</b> and she was therefore disqualified from marrying into the priesthood, which meant that Yannai was a <i>ḥalal</i>. <b>And the matter was investigated and was not discovered,</b> i.e., they sought witnesses for that event but none were found. <b>And the Sages of Israel were expelled in</b> the king’s <b>rage,</b> due to this rumor.
<b>And Elazar ben Po’ira said to King Yannai: King Yannai, such is the judgment of a common person in Israel.</b> In other words, merely expelling a slanderer is appropriate if the subject of the slander is a commoner. <b>But you are a king and a High Priest.</b> Is <b>this your judgment</b> as well? Yannai replied: <b>And what should I do?</b> Elazar responded: <b>If you listen to my advice, crush them.</b> Yannai countered: <b>But what will become of the Torah?</b> He retorted: <b>Behold,</b> it <b>is wrapped and placed in the corner. Anyone who wishes to study can come and study.</b> We have no need for the Sages.
The Gemara interjects: <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: Immediately, heresy was injected into</b> Yannai, <b>as he should have said</b> to Elazar ben Po’ira: This <b>works out well</b> with regard to <b>the Written Torah,</b> as it can be studied by all on their own, but <b>what</b> will become of <b>the Oral Torah?</b> The Oral Torah is transmitted only by the Sages. The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Immediately, the evil</b> arose and <b>caught fire through Elazar ben Po’ira, and all the Sages of the Jewish people were killed. And the world was desolate</b> of Torah <b>until Shimon ben Shataḥ came and restored the Torah to its former</b> glory. This completes the <i>baraita</i>.
Abaye asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? How did those who conducted the investigation refute the rumor that Yannai’s mother had been taken captive? <b>If we say that two</b> witnesses <b>said</b> that <b>she was taken captive, and two</b> others <b>said</b> that <b>she was not taken captive, what did you see that you rely on these</b> who said that she was not taken captive? Instead, <b>rely on these</b> who said that she was taken captive. In such a scenario, one cannot say definitively that the matter was investigated and found to be false.
<b>Rather,</b> it must be referring <b>to one witness</b> who testified she was taken captive, and two testified that she was not taken captive. <b>And the reason</b> that the lone witness is not deemed credible is only <b>that he is contradicted by the</b> other <b>two,</b> from which it may be inferred that <b>if not for that</b> fact, <b>he would be deemed credible.</b> This supports Abaye’s claim that an uncontested lone witness is deemed credible in a case of this kind.
<b>And Rava</b> could reply that this incident affords no proof, for the following reason: <b>Actually,</b> one can say that there were <b>two</b> witnesses who testified that she was captured <b>and two</b> who testified that she was not, <b>and</b> the case was decided <b>in accordance with that</b> which <b>Rav Aḥa bar Rav Minyumi says</b> in a different context, that it is referring <b>to conspiring witnesses.</b> The second pair of witnesses did not contradict the testimony of the first pair but established them as liars by stating that the first pair were not there to witness the event. This serves to disqualify the testimony of the first pair altogether. <b>Here too,</b> it is referring <b>to</b> witnesses who rendered the first set <b>conspiring witnesses.</b>
<b>And if you wish, say</b> that this is <b>in accordance with</b> the version of the story stated <b>by Rabbi Yitzḥak, as Rabbi Yitzḥak says: They replaced</b> Yannai’s mother <b>with a maidservant.</b> The first witnesses saw that Yannai’s mother was about to be taken captive, but the second pair revealed that she had actually been replaced with a maidservant, thereby negating the testimony of the first set.
<b>Rava says:</b>

Daf 66b

<b>From where do I say</b> my claim that one does not rely on a lone witness in matters of forbidden relations? <b>As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon said: An incident</b> occurred <b>with regard to</b> a water <b>reservoir of Diskim in Yavne, which had the presumptive status of</b> being <b>complete,</b> i.e., they thought it contained forty <i>se’a</i>, the requisite amount for a ritual bath, <b>and they measured it</b> after a time <b>and it was found to be deficient,</b> as it contained less than that amount.
With regard to <b>all</b> immersions of <b>ritual purification performed in</b> the reservoir before it was measured, <b>Rabbi Tarfon would render</b> them <b>ritually pure, and Rabbi Akiva</b> would <b>render</b> them <b>ritually impure.</b> The two Sages discussed the matter. <b>Rabbi Tarfon said: This ritual bath retained the presumptive status of</b> being <b>whole</b> throughout this period, and <b>you are coming to</b> declare it <b>deficient</b> in the past <b>out of uncertainty. Do not deem it deficient out of uncertainty. Rabbi Akiva said</b> in response: <b>This person</b> who immersed himself in that ritual bath <b>retained the presumptive status of</b> being <b>ritually impure</b> before he immersed. <b>You are coming to purify him out of uncertainty. Do not deem him ritually pure out of uncertainty.</b>
<b>Rabbi Tarfon said</b> in response: There is <b>a parable</b> that illustrates this. A priest was <b>standing and sacrificing</b> offerings <b>on the altar, and it became known that he is the son of a divorced woman or the son of a <i>ḥalutza</i>.</b> The <i>halakha</i> is <b>that his</b> earlier <b>service</b> before this discovery remains <b>valid. Rabbi Akiva said:</b> A more accurate <b>parable</b> is that of a priest who was <b>standing and sacrificing on the altar, and it became known that he is blemished.</b> In this case, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that his</b> earlier <b>service</b> is <b>disqualified.</b>
<b>Rabbi Tarfon said: You compared</b> the case of a ritual bath found to be deficient <b>to</b> that of <b>a blemished</b> priest, <b>whereas I compared it to</b> the case of <b>the son of a divorced woman or the son of a <i>ḥalutza</i>. Let us see to which</b> case <b>it is similar. If</b> this case <b>is similar to</b> that of <b>the son of a divorced woman or the son of a <i>ḥalutza</i>, let us treat it like</b> the case of <b>the son of a divorced woman or the son of a <i>ḥalutza</i>; if it is similar to</b> the case of <b>a blemished</b> priest, <b>let us treat it like</b> that of <b>a blemished</b> priest.
<b>Rabbi Akiva began to analyze</b> the matter: <b>The disqualification of a ritual bath</b> is <b>by</b> the testimony of <b>an individual,</b> as witnesses are not required to establish that a ritual bath is deficient, <b>and</b> likewise <b>the disqualification of a blemished</b> priest with regard to performing the Temple service <b>is</b> by the testimony of <b>an individual. And do not let</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the son of a divorced woman or the son of a <i>ḥalutza</i> prove</b> otherwise, <b>as his disqualification is by</b> the testimony of <b>two</b> witnesses. Two witnesses are required to testify about one’s mother to disqualify him from performing the Temple service; one is insufficient.
<b>Alternatively,</b> one can say: <b>The disqualification of a ritual bath is due to</b> the bath <b>itself,</b> and similarly, <b>the disqualification of a blemished</b> priest is <b>due to</b> the priest <b>himself. And do not let</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the son of a divorced woman or the son of a <i>ḥalutza</i> prove</b> otherwise, <b>as his disqualification is due to others,</b> i.e., through his mother. <b>Rabbi Tarfon said to him: Akiva, anyone who separates from you, it is as though he has separated from life</b> itself. Rabbi Tarfon was impressed by Rabbi Akiva’s explanation and accepted it. This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara returns to the topic at hand: <b>What are the circumstances</b> with regard to <b>this blemished</b> priest <b>whose disqualification is by</b> means of <b>an individual</b> witness? <b>If</b> the priest <b>denies his</b> claim, maintaining that he is not blemished, <b>is</b> a lone witness <b>deemed credible? Rather,</b> it must be <b>that</b> the priest remains <b>silent</b> and therefore is considered to have admitted to the accusation.
<b>And similarly with regard to the son of a divorced woman or the son of a <i>ḥalutza</i>,</b> it must also be referring <b>to</b> one who is <b>silent, and</b> yet the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: The disqualification of a ritual bath</b> is <b>by</b> the testimony of <b>an individual, and</b> likewise <b>the disqualification of a blemished</b> priest with regard to performing the Temple service <b>is</b> by the testimony of <b>an individual. And do not let</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the son of a divorced woman or the son of a <i>ḥalutza</i> prove</b> otherwise, <b>as his disqualification is by</b> the testimony of <b>two</b> witnesses. This indicates that if the person under scrutiny himself remains silent, one witness is insufficient to disqualify him.
<b>And Abaye</b> could have <b>said</b> in response to this proof: <b>Actually,</b> both cases deal <b>with</b> an individual <b>who denies</b> the witness’s testimony, <b>and that which you said: Why is</b> the witness <b>deemed credible</b> when he says that this priest is blemished, it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the witness <b>said to him: Remove</b> your clothes and <b>show</b> us that you are not blemished. Since this is a matter that can be investigated, the witness is deemed credible, because if he were lying the priest could prove it. <b>And this</b> explanation <b>is</b> consistent with <b>that which the <i>baraita</i> teaches: The disqualification of a ritual bath is due to</b> the bath <b>itself,</b> and similarly, <b>the disqualification of a blemished</b> priest is <b>due to</b> the priest <b>himself,</b> as he himself can be examined. <b>And do not let</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the son of a divorced woman or the son of a <i>ḥalutza</i> prove</b> otherwise, <b>as his disqualification is due to others.</b>
The Gemara asks a question with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that the service of the son of a divorced woman or the son of a <i>ḥalutza</i> is valid</b> after the fact? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: As the verse states</b> with regard to Pinehas the priest: <b>“And it shall be for him and his seed after him</b> the covenant of an everlasting priesthood” (Numbers 25:13), which includes <b>both fit seed and unfit seed.</b> This teaches that the service of a priest is valid after the fact even if he was disqualified.
<b>Shmuel’s father said</b> that the proof text is <b>from here:</b> It states in the blessing of the tribe of Levi: <b>“Bless, Lord, his substance [<i>ḥeilo</i>], and accept the work of his hands”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:11). The word <i>ḥeilo</i> is expounded as including <b>even</b> the service of <b>his profane ones [<i>ḥullin</i>],</b> which God will <b>accept</b> after the fact.
<b>Rabbi Yannai said:</b> The source is <b>from here,</b> a verse stated with regard to first fruits: <b>“And you shall come to the priest who shall be in those days”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:3). <b>But can it enter your mind that a person can come to a priest who is not</b> alive <b>in his days?</b> What then is the meaning of the phrase “in those days”? <b>Rather, this</b> is referring to <b>a fit</b> priest <b>who</b> later <b>became</b> established as <b>a <i>ḥalal</i>.</b> All his previous days of service are considered those of a fit priest.
The Gemara continues its analysis of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that the service of a blemished</b> priest <b>is</b> retroactively <b>invalid? Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: As the verse states</b> with regard to Pinehas: <b>“Wherefore say: Behold, I give to him My covenant of peace [<i>shalom</i>]”</b> (Numbers 25:12), which means that he receives the covenant <b>when he is whole [<i>shalem</i>], but not when he is</b> blemished and <b>lacking</b> a limb. The Gemara comments: <b>But <i>shalom</i> is written,</b> rather than <i>shalem</i>. <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> The letter <b><i>vav</i></b> in the word <b><i>shalom</i> is severed.</b> According to tradition, this letter is written with a break in it, and therefore the word can be read as though the <i>vav</i> were missing.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There is a principle with regard to the <i>hala-khot</i> of lineage: <b>Any case where there is betrothal,</b> i.e., where the betrothal takes effect, <b>and</b> the marriage involves <b>no transgression</b> by Torah law, the lineage of <b>the offspring follows the male,</b> his father. <b>And</b> in <b>which</b> case <b>is this</b> applicable? For example, <b>this</b> is the case with regard to <b>the daughter of a priest;</b> or <b>the daughter of a Levite; or the daughter of an Israelite, who married a priest, a Levite, or an Israelite.</b> In all these cases the child’s lineage is established by his father’s family.
<b>And any case where there is</b> a valid <b>betrothal and</b> yet <b>there is a transgression, the offspring follows the flawed</b> parent. <b>And</b> in <b>which</b> case <b>is this</b> applicable? For example, <b>this</b> is the case of <b>a widow</b> who is married <b>to a High Priest,</b> or <b>a divorced woman or a <i>ḥalutza</i></b> who is married <b>to a common priest,</b> or <b>a <i>mamzeret</i> or a Gibeonite woman</b> who is married <b>to an Israelite,</b> or <b>an Israelite woman</b> who is married <b>to a <i>mamzer</i> or to a Gibeonite.</b> In these situations the child inherits the status of the blemished parent.
<b>And</b> in <b>any</b> case <b>where</b> a woman <b>cannot</b> join in <b>betrothal with</b> a particular man, as the betrothal does not take effect, <b>but she can</b> join in <b>betrothal with others,</b> i.e., the woman is considered a member of the Jewish people and can marry other Jews, in these cases <b>the offspring is a <i>mamzer</i>. And</b> in <b>which</b> case <b>is this</b> applicable? <b>This is one who engages in intercourse with any one of those with whom relations are forbidden that are</b> written <b>in the Torah. And</b> in <b>any</b> case <b>where</b> a woman <b>cannot</b> join in <b>betrothal with him or with others, the offspring is like her.</b> He is not considered his father’s son at all, but has the same status as his mother. <b>And</b> in <b>which</b> case <b>is this</b> applicable? <b>This is the offspring of</b> a Canaanite <b>maidservant or a gentile woman,</b> as her child is a slave or a gentile like her. If he converts, he is not a <i>mamzer</i>.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that <b>any case where there is betrothal</b> and the marriage involves no transgression, the lineage of the offspring follows the male. <b>Rabbi Shimon said to Rabbi Yoḥanan: Is</b> it an established <b>principle</b> that <b>any case where there is betrothal and there is no transgression the offspring</b> invariably <b>follows the male? But</b>

Daf 67a

there is the case of <b>a convert who married a <i>mamzeret</i>, where there is</b> a valid <b>betrothal and there is no transgression,</b> as they are permitted to marry each other, and yet <b>the offspring follows the flawed</b> lineage and is a <i>mamzer</i>. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a convert who married a <i>mamzeret</i>, the offspring is a <i>mamzer</i>.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Rabbi Shimon: <b>Do you maintain</b> that <b>the mishna is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei?</b> Not so; <b>the mishna is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says: A convert may not marry a <i>mamzeret</i>, and</b> therefore in this case <b>there is betrothal and there is a transgression,</b> which is why <b>the offspring follows the flawed</b> lineage.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> this case as one of its examples. The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>taught</b> the principle: <b>Any case</b> where there is betrothal and a transgression, <b>in the latter clause,</b> precisely <b>to include</b> this kind of case. There is a guiding principle of the Gemara’s interpretation of the Mishna that a mishna does not include extraneous phrases. Every apparently superfluous phrase in the context of a principle serves to include or exclude a certain case from that principle. This is the basis of the discussion of the Gemara here and below.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> a different answer: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, and</b> it <b>taught</b> the phrase: In <b>which</b> case <b>is this</b> applicable, <b>to exclude</b> cases of betrothal without a transgression other than those listed in the mishna. The offspring follows the lineage of the father only in those cases specified by the mishna.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> does the list that follows the phrase: In <b>which</b> case <b>is this</b> applicable, include all applicable cases? <b>And</b> are there <b>no more? But</b> there is the example of <b>a <i>ḥalal</i> who married an Israelite woman, where</b> there <b>is betrothal and there is no transgression,</b> and yet <b>the offspring follows the male,</b> as he too is a <i>ḥalal</i>. The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as one can say that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dostai ben Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who maintains that the offspring of this union is entirely fit.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> there is the case of <b>an Israelite who married a <i>ḥalala</i>, where there is betrothal and there is no transgression,</b> and <b>the offspring follows the male,</b> and yet this case is not mentioned in the mishna. The Gemara responds: The mishna <b>taught</b> the principle: <b>Any case</b> where there is betrothal and no transgression, <b>in the first clause, to include</b> this situation.
The Gemara asks: <b>But let</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teach explicitly</b> this example of an Israelite who married a <i>ḥalala</i>. The Gemara answers: He did not do so <b>because he cannot teach it,</b> i.e., the <i>tanna</i> cannot mention this <i>halakha</i> in brief as part of the list. The Gemara clarifies its answer: <b>How can</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> it? He cannot state: <b>A daughter of a priest; and a daughter of a Levite; and a daughter of an Israelite; and a <i>ḥalala</i>, who married a priest, a Levite, or an Israelite,</b> as, <b>is a <i>ḥalala</i> fit for a priest?</b> This marriage involves a transgression. Consequently, the sentence of the mishna cannot be constructed so as to include a <i>ḥalala</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>But there is</b> also the <i>halakha</i> <b>of Rabba bar bar Ḥana, as Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>a second-generation Egyptian man,</b> i.e., the son of an Egyptian convert, <b>who married a first-generation Egyptian woman,</b> a woman who herself converted, <b>her son is</b> considered <b>a third-generation</b> Egyptian who may marry a Jew of unflawed lineage. This is an example of a betrothal without a transgression where the offspring follows the father.
The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>taught</b> the principle: <b>Any case</b> where there is betrothal and no transgression, <b>in the first clause, to include</b> this example. The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Dimi, who said</b> that this son <b>is a second-generation</b> Egyptian, the mishna <b>taught:</b> In <b>which</b> case <b>is this</b> applicable, at its beginning, with regard to betrothal that does not involve a transgression, <b>to exclude</b> this case. Rav Dimi maintains that this son may not marry a Jew of unflawed lineage.
The Gemara asks: <b>But there is</b> the following case, which apparently contradicts the principle of the mishna: <b>As when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>he</b> said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: With regard to the nations,</b> i.e., if members of two different nations married when they were gentiles, <b>follow the male</b> to determine the status of their child. This is the case whether he is a regular gentile, who may marry a Jew of unflawed lineage as soon as he converts, or whether he is an Ammonite or an Egyptian, who may not marry a Jewish woman of unflawed lineage. In either case the child’s status follows that of the father.
If these members of two different nations <b>converted, follow the flawed</b> lineage <b>of the two.</b> These converts are permitted to marry one another and their betrothal is effective. If either the father or mother is Egyptian, the child follows the parent with the flawed lineage and would be Egyptian, whereas according to the principle stated in the mishna, one should follow the male. The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>taught:</b> In <b>which</b> case <b>is this</b> applicable, in the first clause, <b>to exclude</b> this case.
The Gemara returns to an earlier point: <b>What is this</b> claim, that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei? <b>Granted, if you say that the mishna is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> one can explain that the phrase: <b>Any case, of the first clause,</b> serves <b>to include an Israelite who married a <i>ḥalala</i>,</b> as the child follows the father in that case too, <b>and</b> also to include the ruling of <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana</b> that the son of a second-generation Egyptian who married a first-generation Egyptian woman is a third-generation Egyptian. Furthermore, the expression: In <b>which</b> case <b>is this</b> applicable, serves <b>to exclude</b> the ruling of <b>Rav Dimi</b> that her son is a second-generation Egyptian, <b>and</b> the statement of <b>Ravin</b> citing Rabbi Yoḥanan.

Daf 67b

And the phrase: <b>Any case, of the latter clause,</b> which is referring to betrothal with a transgression, serves <b>to include a convert who married a <i>mamzeret</i>. But if you say</b> that the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> then granted the phrase: <b>Any case</b> where there is betrothal and no transgression, <b>of the first clause, is as we said,</b> i.e., it includes an Israelite who married a <i>ḥalala</i>; and the phrase: In <b>which</b> case <b>is this</b> applicable, <b>is as we said,</b> i.e., to the exclusion of Ravin or Rav Dimi, and the case of a convert who married a <i>mamzeret</i>. <b>But what</b> does the phrase: <b>Any case, of the latter clause,</b> serve <b>to add?</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> the same question applies <b>to Rabbi Yehuda</b> as well: <b>Why do I</b> need the phrase: In <b>which</b> case <b>is this</b> applicable, <b>of the latter clause? Rather,</b> you must say: <b>Since</b> the mishna <b>taught</b> its <b>first clause</b> using the phrase: In <b>which</b> case <b>is this</b> applicable, <b>it</b> also <b>taught</b> its <b>latter clause</b> using the phrase: In <b>which</b> case <b>is this</b> applicable, merely for the sake of stylistic consistency. <b>So too</b> here, with regard to Rabbi Yosei’s opinion, one can say: <b>Since</b> the mishna <b>taught</b> the <b>first clause</b> with the expression: <b>Any case, it</b> also <b>taught</b> its <b>latter clause</b> with: <b>Any case.</b>
§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> aforementioned matter <b>itself: When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: With regard to the nations,</b> if members of two different nations married when they were gentiles, <b>follow the male</b> to determine the status of their child. If <b>they converted</b> before marriage, <b>follow the flawed</b> lineage <b>of the two.</b>
The Gemara analyzes this statement: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>With regard to the nations, follow the male? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to one</b> member <b>of the nations</b> outside Eretz Yisrael <b>who engaged in intercourse with a Canaanite woman and fathered a son</b> from her, <b>that you are permitted to purchase</b> the son <b>as a slave,</b> and he is not considered a member of the Canaanite nations, who are not allowed to live in Eretz Yisrael?
<b>The verse states: “And also of the children of the residents who sojourn with you, of them you may buy”</b> (Leviticus 25:45), which indicates that there is a way in which one may purchase slaves from the inhabitants of Canaan. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> with regard to a Canaanite <b>slave who engaged in intercourse with a maidservant from the</b> other <b>nations and fathered a son, that you are permitted to buy</b> the son <b>as a slave.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Which they have begotten in your land”</b> (Leviticus 25:45). This means that one may purchase <b>from those</b> who are merely <b>begotten in your land,</b> whose fathers are not from the Canaanite nations, <b>but not from those who reside in your land,</b> i.e., whose fathers are from the seven Canaanite nations.
The Gemara discusses the second clause of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement: If <b>they converted, follow the flawed</b> lineage <b>of the two. To which</b> case does this refer? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring <b>to an Egyptian man who married an Ammonite woman, what flawed</b> lineage <b>is there</b> here? The lineage of an Ammonite woman who converts is not flawed at all, as the Sages expounded that the verse: “An Ammonite…shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 23:4) is referring to <b>an Ammonite man but not an Ammonite woman,</b> which means that she can marry a Jew of unflawed lineage.
<b>Rather,</b> it must be referring <b>to an Ammonite man who married an Egyptian woman, and</b> in that case <b>if</b> the child <b>is a male, cast him after</b> his father, and render him permanently prohibited from entering the congregation as an Ammonite male. <b>And if</b> the child born to them <b>is a female, cast her after</b> the mother, so that she is considered a second-generation Egyptian, who may not marry a Jew of unflawed lineage.
§ The mishna teaches that in <b>any</b> case <b>where</b> a woman <b>cannot</b> join in <b>betrothal with him,</b> but she can join in betrothal with others, the offspring is a <i>mamzer</i>. The Gemara explains: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says, and</b> some <b>determined</b> that <b>it</b> was said <b>in the name of Rabbi Yannai; and Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, determined</b> that <b>it</b> was said <b>in the name of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: The verse states</b> with regard to a divorced woman: <b>“And she departs out of his house, and goes and becomes another man’s wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:2). This teaches that she can become the wife <b>of others, but not of relatives,</b> i.e., betrothal to forbidden relatives does not take effect.
<b>Rabbi Abba objects to this: But</b> one can <b>say</b> and explain that the term <b>“another”</b> in the verse indicates: <b>But not to</b> her husband’s <b>son,</b> i.e., betrothal is ineffective only in the case of a prohibition that warrants court-imposed capital punishment, not one that warrants <i>karet</i>. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>With regard to a son it is explicitly written: “A man shall not take his father’s wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:1), which means that betrothal is ineffective in this situation. If so, <b>why do I</b> need the emphasis of the term <b>“another”? Learn from</b> this term <b>that</b> she may marry <b>others but not relatives.</b>
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that both <b>this</b> verse <b>and that</b> verse are referring <b>to a son</b> and yet both are necessary, as <b>this</b> verse: “Shall not take,” is referring to the <i>halakha <b>ab initio</b></i><b>.</b> It does not mean that betrothal is ineffective, but merely that one may not marry his father’s wife. <b>And that</b> verse: “And becomes another man’s wife,” teaches that even <b>after the fact,</b> if the son attempted to betroth his father’s wife, his act is of no consequence.
The Gemara responds: One learns that betrothal is ineffective in this case <b><i>ab initio</i></b> from a different source, as it is <b>derived from</b> the prohibition proscribing <b>a wife’s sister</b> by the following <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>If,</b> with regard to the prohibition proscribing <b>a wife’s sister,</b> whose transgression is punished <b>with <i>karet</i>, she cannot be betrothed</b> by her sister’s husband, in accordance with the verse: “And you shall not take a woman with her sister” (Leviticus 18:18), then with regard to cases that entail <b>liability to</b> receive <b>court-imposed capital punishment,</b> e.g., intercourse with one’s father’s wife, is it <b>not all the more so</b> the case that betrothal does not take effect?
The Gemara suggests another interpretation of the verses. <b>But</b> as the verse has already prohibited betrothal to a wife’s sister, one can <b>say</b> as follows: Both <b>this</b> verse: “You shall not take” (Leviticus 18:18), <b>and that</b> one: “Becomes another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2), are referring <b>to a wife’s sister,</b> as <b>this</b> one: “You shall not take,” prohibits this relationship <b><i>ab initio</i>,</b> whereas <b>that</b> verse: “Another man’s wife,” teaches that this betrothal is of no effect even <b>after the fact.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Yes, it is indeed so.</b> The verse should be interpreted in this manner.
The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for the prohibition proscribing <b>a wife’s sister; from where do we</b> derive that betrothal is also ineffective for the <b>other forbidden relations?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>We derive</b> it <b>from</b> the case of <b>a wife’s sister,</b> by means of the following analogy: <b>Just as</b> the prohibition with regard to <b>a wife’s sister,</b> which is <b>specified</b> by the Torah, <b>is</b> a prohibition of <b>a forbidden relative</b> that is punished with <b><i>karet</i> for its intentional</b> transgression <b>and</b> requires <b>a sin-offering for its unwitting</b> transgression, <b>and betrothal is ineffective in</b> this case, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>any</b> prohibition <b>that</b> involves <b>a forbidden relative whose intentional</b> transgression is punished with <b><i>karet</i> and whose unwitting</b> transgression renders one liable to bring <b>a sin-offering, betrothal is</b> likewise <b>ineffective in</b> those cases.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> virtually <b>all</b> other forbidden relatives can be <b>derived</b> in this manner. <b>But</b> the cases of <b>a married woman and a brother’s wife</b> are exceptions, and the analogy in these cases <b>can be refuted</b> as follows. <b>What</b> is unique <b>about a wife’s sister is that she is not permitted in the case of a mitzva,</b> as even where the mitzva of levirate marriage would apply, one still may not marry one’s wife’s sister. <b>Will you say</b> the same <b>with regard to a brother’s wife, who is permitted in the case of</b> the <b>mitzva</b> of levirate marriage?
With regard to <b>a married woman</b> the interpretation <b>can likewise be refuted: What</b> is unique <b>about these</b> cases of a wife’s sister and a brother’s wife is <b>that they cannot be permitted during the lives of those whose</b> existence <b>renders them prohibited,</b> as neither a wife’s sister nor a brother’s wife can be permitted while the person who causes the prohibition is alive. This caveat is added because one’s wife’s sister does become permitted once his wife has died. <b>Will you say</b> the same <b>with regard to a married woman, who</b> can become <b>permitted during the life of the one who renders her forbidden,</b> by means of a divorce?
<b>Rather,</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that betrothal is ineffective for other forbidden relatives, is derived from a different source, as <b>Rabbi Yona says, and some say</b> this was taught by <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: The verse states</b> explicitly in the chapter dealing with forbidden relatives: <b>“Whoever shall do any of these abominations shall be cut off”</b> (Leviticus 18:29). In this verse <b>all those with whom relations are forbidden are juxtaposed</b> to one another, and therefore also <b>to a wife’s sister: Just as betrothal is not effective</b> in the case of <b>a wife’s sister, so too, betrothal is not effective with regard to all those with whom relations are forbidden.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived from here,

Daf 68a

then <b>even</b> if he betrothed <b>a menstruating woman as well,</b> his betrothal should not be effective and the offspring should be a <i>mamzer</i>, as a menstruating woman is included in the list in that chapter of those with whom sexual intercourse is forbidden. If so, <b>why</b> did <b>Abaye say: All concede with regard to one who engages in intercourse with a menstruating woman or with a <i>sota</i>,</b> a woman forbidden to her husband on suspicion of being unfaithful to him, <b>that the offspring is not a <i>mamzer</i>? Ḥizkiyya said:</b> In the case of a menstruating woman, <b>the verse states: “And her impurity be [<i>ut’hi</i>] upon him”</b> (Leviticus 15:24), from which it is derived that <b>even at the time of her impurity,</b> the type of <b>becoming [<i>havaya</i>]</b> stated with regard to betrothal (see Deuteronomy 24:2) <b>should</b> apply <b>to her.</b> The Gemara is interpreting the connection between the words <i>ut’hi</i> and <i>havaya</i>, as both share the same Hebrew root.
The Gemara asks: <b>After all, there is</b> the possibility <b>of juxtaposing</b> all other forbidden relatives <b>to a menstruating woman, and there is</b> also the possibility <b>of juxtaposing</b> them <b>to a wife’s sister. What did you see that you juxtaposed them to a wife’s sister?</b> Why not <b>juxtapose them</b> instead <b>to a menstruating woman?</b> The Gemara answers: When there is an option of juxtaposing a case in a manner that leads to <b>a leniency, or</b> juxtaposing it to a <i>halakha</i> that entails <b>a stringency, we juxtapose</b> it in a fashion that leads <b>to a stringency.</b>
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said</b> that there is a different source for the <i>halakha</i> that betrothal is ineffective with forbidden relatives: This principle <b>is derived by</b> means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the case of <b>a <i>yevama</i>: Just as a <i>yevama</i>,</b> before she is released from the <i>yavam</i> through <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>is</b> forbidden <b>by</b> a mere <b>prohibition,</b> which entails lashes, and yet <b>betrothal is not effective with her,</b> with regard to <b>those</b> people with whom sexual intercourse renders one <b>liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty <b>or liable to</b> be punished with <b><i>karet</i>,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> the case that betrothal should not be effective in these cases? The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> meaning that this is the source, one should <b>also</b> derive that betrothal is ineffective with any <b>other</b> people with whom one <b>is</b> only <b>liable</b> for violating <b>a prohibition</b> of engaging in intercourse, by means of the same analogy.
Rav Pappa says: It <b>is written explicitly</b> in the Torah that a man can betroth women <b>with whom he is liable</b> for violating ordinary <b>prohibitions</b> of intercourse. The Torah states in a different context: <b>“If a man has two wives, the one beloved and the one hated”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:15). Rav Pappa asks rhetorically: <b>But is there one who is hated before the Omnipresent and one who is beloved before the Omnipresent? Rather, “beloved”</b> means <b>beloved in her marriage,</b> i.e., her marriage is permitted; <b>“hated”</b> means <b>hated in her marriage,</b> i.e., her marriage involves the violation of a prohibition. <b>And</b> despite the fact that the latter marriage is between a man and a woman who are forbidden to one another, their union still has the status of a marriage, as <b>the Merciful One states: “If a man has</b> two wives,” i.e., he is married to both of them.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says: Betrothal does not take effect</b> even <b>with</b> those women with whom one <b>is</b> only <b>liable</b> for violating <b>a prohibition</b> of engaging in intercourse, <b>with regard to what</b> case <b>does he establish</b> the verse: <b>“If a man has</b> two wives”? The Gemara answers: He explains that this verse is referring <b>to a widow</b> married <b>to a High Priest, and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Simai.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Simai says: From all</b> relationships that involve prohibitions, <b>Rabbi Akiva would render</b> the offspring <b>a <i>mamzer</i>, except for</b> the marriage of <b>a widow to a High Priest, as the Torah said: “And he shall not profane [<i>yeḥallel</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 21:15), which teaches that <b>he renders them profane [<i>ḥillulim</i>],</b> i.e., his children from this marriage are <i>ḥalalim</i>, <b>but he does not render</b> them labeled with <b><i>mamzer</i> status.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what can be said <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yeshevav, who says: Come, let us shout at Akiva ben Yosef, who would say:</b> In <b>every</b> case where <b>a Jew may not engage in intercourse</b> with a particular woman, and he does so, <b>the offspring</b> that results from this union <b>is a <i>mamzer</i>,</b> even the child of a widow and a High Priest? <b>This works out well</b> even <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yeshevav if he comes to exclude the reason of Rabbi Simai,</b> i.e., if he means to take issue with the ruling of Rabbi Akiva in the specific case mentioned by Rabbi Simai, that of a widow married to a High Priest, then Rabbi Yeshevav too concedes that according to the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, betrothal does take effect in a case where a positive mitzva is violated by the betrothal. Accordingly, one can establish the phrase “and the one hated” (Deuteronomy 21:15) as referring to those whose marriage entailed the violation of a positive mitzva.
<b>But if</b> he states <b>a reasoning of his own,</b> i.e., he states an independent statement critical of Rabbi Akiva’s ruling that the child of any illicit union is a <i>mamzer</i>, <b>and</b> it is a categorical statement that applies to all illicit unions, <b>even those liable</b> for violating <b>a positive mitzva,</b> i.e., Rabbi Akiva holds that even the offspring of this relationship is a <i>mamzer</i>, <b>with regard to what</b> case <b>does he interpret</b> the “hated” woman of the above verse?
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yeshevav would say that the verse is referring <b>to a non-virgin</b> married <b>to a High Priest,</b> as there is a positive mitzva that a High Priest should marry a virgin. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> the previous ones? If Rabbi Yeshevav holds that a child born of any act of intercourse prohibited by a positive mitzva is a <i>mamzer</i>, the marriage of a non-virgin to a High Priest likewise involves the violation of a positive mitzva. The Gemara answers: <b>Because it is a positive mitzva that is not equally applicable to all,</b> and since this command applies only to a High Priest and not to other Jews, its violation is considered less severe than that of other positive mitzvot.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Akiva’s opinion, <b>rather than establishing</b> the verse: “If a man has two wives, the one beloved and the one hated” (Deuteronomy 21:15), as referring <b>to</b> those who are <b>liable for</b> violating <b>prohibitions, let them establish it</b> as referring <b>to those liable for</b> violating <b>a positive mitzva.</b> In other words, betrothal should not be effective if it involves the violation of a prohibition. And as for the “hated” woman whose marriage is nevertheless valid, mentioned in that verse, this is referring to one whose engaging in sexual intercourse violates a positive mitzva.
The Gemara responds: <b>These</b> cases where they are <b>liable</b> for violating <b>a positive mitzva, what are they? If</b> you say that <b>both</b> wives are <b>Egyptian</b> converts, <b>they are both hated,</b> as both marriages are prohibited. <b>If</b> you claim that <b>one is an Egyptian woman and the other a Jewish woman</b> of unflawed lineage, this cannot be the case, as <b>we require “two wives” from the same nation,</b> since the Torah equates the two women. <b>If</b> the hated one is <b>a non-virgin</b> married <b>to a High Priest,</b> this too is problematic, as, <b>is it written: If a priest has</b> two wives? The verse merely says: “If a man has two wives.” Consequently, the verse cannot be interpreted as referring to those who are liable for violating a positive mitzva.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> that betrothal that involves a prohibition does not take effect, this verse can be referring only to a non-virgin who marries a High Priest, or marriage to a female Egyptian convert, which involve the violation of positive mitzvot. Can the verse really be interpreted as concerning such unlikely cases? The Gemara answers: <b>You are forced to leave this verse</b> aside, <b>as it establishes itself as</b> dealing with <b>a difficult</b> case. In other words, as Rabbi Akiva claims that betrothal is ineffective if any prohibition is involved, he has no choice but to explain the verse that says: “If a man has two wives,” in this forced manner.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> in <b>any</b> case <b>where</b> a woman <b>cannot</b> join in betrothal <b>with him</b> or with others, the offspring is like her. This ruling refers specifically to a Canaanite maidservant or a gentile woman. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that betrothal with <b>a Canaanite maidservant</b> is ineffective? <b>Rav Huna says: The verse states</b> that Abraham commanded his slaves: <b>“You abide here with [<i>im</i>] the donkey”</b> (Genesis 22:5), which alludes to the fact that his slaves belong to <b>a nation [<i>am</i>] similar to a donkey;</b> just as betrothal is ineffective with animals, it is likewise ineffective with Canaanite maidservants. The Gemara comments: <b>We have found that betrothal is ineffective with</b> a Canaanite maidservant;

Daf 68b

<b>from where do we</b> derive that <b>her offspring is like her?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As the verse states</b> with regard to a Hebrew slave who marries a Canaanite maidservant: <b>“The wife and her children shall be her master’s”</b> (Exodus 21:4). This indicates that the offspring of a Canaanite maidservant and a Hebrew slave are slaves, as she is.
§ The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that betrothal with <b>a gentile woman</b> is ineffective? <b>The verse states: “Neither shall you make marriages with them”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:3), which teaches that marrying gentile women is halakhically meaningless. The Gemara asks: <b>We have found that betrothal is ineffective with her; from where do we</b> derive that <b>her offspring is like her?</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: As the verse states</b> with regard to the same issue: “Your daughter you shall not give to his son…<b>for he will turn away your son from following Me”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:3–4). Since the verse is concerned that after one’s daughter marries a gentile, the father will lead his children away from the service of God, this indicates that <b>your son,</b> i.e., your grandson, <b>from a Jewish woman is called “your son”</b> by the Torah, <b>but your son from a gentile woman is not called your son, but her son.</b>
<b>Ravina said: Learn from</b> it that <b>the son of your daughter, born to a gentile, is called your son</b> in all regards. The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>Ravina holds</b> that with regard to <b>a gentile or</b> a Canaanite <b>slave who engaged in sexual intercourse with a Jewish woman, the offspring is a <i>mamzer</i>?</b> One can infer from the fact that the offspring of this union is called “your son” that he is a Jew, and therefore the principle stated in the mishna should apply: If a woman cannot join in betrothal with someone, their child is a <i>mamzer</i>.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Although he is not a fit</b> offspring, <b>he is</b> also <b>not a <i>mamzer</i>.</b> Rather, <b>he is</b> merely <b>called disqualified.</b> Since betrothal is inapplicable to a gentile, a gentile is not included in the category of someone with whom a Jewish woman cannot personally join in betrothal, as no Jewish women can be betrothed to him. Nevertheless, as their child’s birth is the result of a transgression, he is considered disqualified.
The Gemara asks a question with regard to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement. <b>That</b> verse: “Neither shall you make marriages with them” (Deuteronomy 7:3), <b>is written with regard to the seven nations</b> of Canaan. <b>From where do we</b> derive that betrothal does not take effect with the <b>other nations?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> as a reason for prohibiting intermarriages: <b>“For he will turn away your son</b> from following Me,” which serves <b>to include all those who might turn</b> a child <b>away,</b> no matter from which nation.
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who expounds the reason</b> for the mitzvot of <b>the verse</b> and rules accordingly. Since the reason is that the gentile might turn away the son’s heart, there should be no distinction between the Canaanite nations and other gentiles. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who do not expound the reason for the mitzvot of the verse and rule accordingly, since the verse mentions only the Canaanite nations, <b>what is the reason,</b> the source for the prohibition, with regard to the other nations?
The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to a beautiful captive woman: <b>“And after that you may go in to her and be her husband,</b> and she shall be your wife” (Deuteronomy 21:13). One can derive from here <b>by inference that at the outset,</b> before she became a Jew, <b>betrothal would not take effect with her,</b> despite the fact that he had already brought her into his house, and according to some opinions, had even engaged in sexual intercourse with her.
The Gemara asks another question: <b>We found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that <b>betrothal is ineffective with her; from where do we</b> derive that <b>her child is like her?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “If a man has</b> two wives, the one beloved and the one hated, <b>and they have borne him</b> children” (Deuteronomy 21:15), from which it is derived: <b>Anywhere that we read: “If he has,”</b> i.e., that a woman can be betrothed, <b>we</b> also <b>read: “And they have borne him,”</b> meaning that their children follow his lineage. <b>And anywhere that we do not read: “If he has,” we</b> likewise <b>do not read: “And they have borne him,”</b> as the offspring inherit their mother’s status.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> one should learn from here with regard to a Canaanite <b>maidservant too,</b> that her child is like her, which means that the earlier proof from the verse: “The wife and her children” (Exodus 21:4), is not necessary. The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so;</b> this source also teaches the <i>halakha</i> that the offspring of a maidservant is like her. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the verse <b>“The wife and her children shall be her master’s”?</b> This verse apparently teaches nothing new with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of lineage. The Gemara answers: It is required <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:

Daf 69a

With regard to <b>one who says to his</b> pregnant Canaanite <b>maidservant: You are hereby a free woman but your offspring</b> shall remain <b>a slave, the offspring is</b> emancipated <b>like her.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. And the Rabbis say:</b> The master’s <b>statement is upheld, because it is stated: “The wife and her children shall be her master’s”</b> (Exodus 21:4).
The Gemara expresses surprise at this ruling: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation</b> here? How do the Rabbis learn from here that the child of an emancipated maidservant remains a slave in this case? <b>Rava said:</b> The proof from the verse beginning with: “The wife and her children,” is not the source of the opinion of the Rabbis. Rather, this is referring <b>to</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili,</b> who claims that the children follow their mother, as indicated by this verse. Consequently, if she is emancipated, her offspring do not retain the status of slaves.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Tarfon says: <i>Mamzerim</i> can be purified,</b> so that their offspring will not be <i>mamzerim</i>. <b>How so?</b> With regard to <b>a <i>mamzer</i> who married</b> a Canaanite <b>maidservant,</b> their <b>offspring is a slave.</b> If his master subsequently <b>emancipates him,</b> that <b>son is found</b> to be <b>a freeman,</b> rather than a <i>mamzer</i>. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> This method is not effective, as <b>this</b> son <b>is a <i>mamzer</i> slave.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Did <b>Rabbi Tarfon state</b> his <i>halakha <b>ab initio</b></i><b>,</b> i.e., a <i>mamzer</i> is permitted to marry a maidservant, <b>or</b> did <b>he state</b> it only <b>after the fact,</b> but he does not permit a <i>mamzer</i> to marry a maidservant <i>ab initio</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a <i>baraita</i>: The other Sages <b>said to Rabbi Tarfon: You have</b> thereby <b>purified the male</b> offspring of a <i>mamzer</i>, <b>but you have not purified the female</b> children of <i>mamzerim</i>, as your solution does not apply to them.
The Gemara explains the apparent proof from this <i>baraita</i>. <b>And if you say</b> that Rabbi Tarfon <b>stated</b> his <i>halakha <b>ab initio</b></i> and permitted a <i>mamzer</i> to marry a Canaanite maidservant, <b>a <i>mamzeret</i> should also</b> be allowed to <b>marry</b> a Canaanite <b>slave</b> and her child can then be emancipated as well. The Gemara answers: <b>A slave has no lineage.</b> Even if she were to marry a slave, their child would not be considered his, but would be a Jewish <i>mamzer</i> like her. Consequently, this source provides no proof with regard to the Gemara’s question.
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as Rabbi Simlai’s host was a <i>mamzer</i>, and</b> Rabbi Simlai <b>said to him: Had I</b> found out about your status <b>earlier,</b> before you married and had children, <b>I would have purified your sons</b> by advising you to marry a Canaanite maidservant, as suggested by Rabbi Tarfon. The Gemara explains the proof: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that Rabbi Tarfon spoke <b><i>ab initio</i>,</b> it is <b>well</b> that Rabbi Simlai would suggest this. <b>But if you say</b> that he meant only that this method is effective <b>after the fact, what was</b> the advice that Rabbi Simlai would have given his host?
The Gemara answers <b>that</b> Rabbi Simlai would have <b>advised him by saying: Go steal, and be sold as a Hebrew slave,</b> which would mean you could marry a Canaanite maidservant and your offspring would be slaves. The Gemara asks: <b>But in the days of Rabbi Simlai, was</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a Hebrew slave</b> observed in practice? <b>But didn’t the Master say:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of <b>a Hebrew slave is practiced only when the Jubilee</b> Year <b>is practiced,</b> and Rabbi Simlai lived many years after the observance of the Jubilee Year ceased. <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> it that <b>Rabbi Tarfon spoke <i>ab initio</i>,</b> i.e., it is permitted for a <i>mamzer</i> to marry a Canaanite maidservant? The Gemara affirms: Indeed, <b>conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that this is the case. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: This</b> son <b>is a <i>mamzer</i> slave. Rabbi Elazar said: What is the reason of Rabbi Eliezer? As the verse states</b> with regard to a <i>mamzer</i>: “Even to the tenth generation none <b>of his</b> shall enter the assembly of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 23:3), which indicates that in the case of the child of a <i>mamzer</i> and a Canaanite maidservant, one <b>follows his</b> parent with the <b>flawed</b> lineage, and the child is a <i>mamzer</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis,</b> i.e., Rabbi Tarfon, respond to this claim? Rabbi Tarfon maintains <b>that</b> this verse is referring <b>to a Jew</b> of unflawed lineage <b>who married a <i>mamzeret</i>.</b> It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that as <b>it is written: “By their families, by their fathers’ houses”</b> (Numbers 4:2), the child should follow his father’s lineage rather than that of his mother. Therefore, the term <b>“of his”</b> in the previously cited verse <b>comes to exclude him</b> from his father’s lineage, as it indicates that his lineage follows his mother when she is a <i>mamzeret</i>.
<b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> respond to this claim? Is it <b>not</b> the case that <b>even though</b> the Torah <b>wrote: “By their families, by their fathers’ houses,”</b> nevertheless, the term <b>“of his” comes and excludes him? Here too, although it is written: “The wife and her children shall be her master’s”</b> (Exodus 21:4), from which it is derived that the child of a Canaanite maidservant is like her, nevertheless the term <b>“of his” comes and excludes him. And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis,</b> Rabbi Tarfon, respond to this claim? They say: <b>Any offspring in the womb of a Canaanite maidservant is considered like the offspring in an animal’s womb.</b> Consequently, her children do not inherit the father’s status, even if his is the flawed lineage.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There were <b>ten</b> categories of <b>lineage,</b> with varying restrictions on marriage, among the Jews who <b>ascended from Babylonia</b> to Eretz Yisrael with Ezra before the building of the Second Temple. They are as follows: <b>Priests; Levites; Israelites; priests disqualified due to flawed lineage [<i>ḥalalim</i>]; converts, and emancipated slaves; <i>mamzerim</i>; Gibeonites,</b> i.e., the descendants of the Gibeonites who converted in the time of Joshua; <b>children of unknown paternity [<i>shetuki</i>]; and foundlings.</b>
The mishna proceeds to detail their <i>halakhot</i>: With regard to <b>priests, Levites, and Israelites,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> for men and women in these categories <b>to marry one another.</b> With regard to <b>Levites</b> who are not priests, <b>Israelites, <i>ḥalalim</i>, converts, and emancipated slaves,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> for men and women in these categories <b>to marry one another.</b>
With regard to <b>converts, and emancipated slaves, <i>mamzerim</i>, and Gibeonites, children of unknown paternity [<i>shetuki</i>], and foundlings,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> for <b>all of</b> the men and women in these categories <b>to marry one another. And these are</b> the last two categories: <b>A <i>shetuki</i></b> is <b>any</b> person <b>who knows</b> the identity of <b>his mother but does not know</b> the identity of <b>his father. A foundling</b> is <b>anyone who was collected from the marketplace and doesn’t know</b> the identity of his parents, <b>neither</b> that of <b>his father nor</b> that of <b>his mother.</b> These two categories are people whose status is uncertain; they may be <i>mamzerim</i>. <b>Abba Shaul would call a <i>shetuki</i></b> by the label of <b><i>beduki</i>.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: There were <b>ten</b> categories of <b>lineage</b> among the Jews who <b>ascended from Babylonia.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>specifically teach</b> the phrase: <b>Ascended from Babylonia?</b> Why was it important for the <i>tanna</i> to specify their place of origin? <b>Let him teach</b> that they <b>went to Eretz Yisrael.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He teaches us a matter in passing, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And you shall arise and go up to the place that the Lord, your God, shall choose”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:8). This <b>teaches that the Temple is higher than all of Eretz Yisrael,</b> which is why the verse speaks of ascending from the cities of Eretz Yisrael to the Temple. <b>And</b> it teaches that <b>Eretz Yisrael is higher than all of the lands.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, the Temple is higher than all of Eretz Yisrael. This is</b> derived from <b>that which is written:</b>

Daf 69b

<b>“Matters of controversy within your gates, and you shall arise and go up</b> to the place that the Lord, your God, shall choose” (Deuteronomy 17:8), indicating that the Temple, the place that God chose, is higher than all other cities in Eretz Yisrael. <b>But from where do we</b> derive the claim <b>that Eretz Yisrael is higher than all</b> other <b>lands?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “Therefore behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when they shall no more say: As the Lord lives, Who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, but: As the Lord lives, Who brought up and Who led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all the countries where I had driven them”</b> (Jeremiah 23:7–8). The phrase “Who brought up” indicates that Eretz Yisrael is higher than all the other lands from where God will bring the Jewish people.
The Gemara asks: If that is what the mishna wants to teach, <b>why does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>specifically teach: Ascended from Babylonia? Let him teach: Ascended to Eretz Yisrael.</b> The Gemara answers that the wording of the mishna <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar says: Ezra did not ascend from Babylonia until he made it like fine flour,</b> free of bran, i.e., he ensured that the lineage of those remaining was unsullied, and selected all of those in Babylonia who were of questionable lineage, <b>and</b> then <b>he ascended</b> with them to Eretz Yisrael.
§ It <b>was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> had a dispute with regard to this matter. <b>Abaye said: We learned</b> in the mishna that there were ten categories of lineage among the Jews who <b>ascended,</b> meaning that they ascended <b>of their own</b> accord. <b>And Rava said: We learned:</b> Ezra <b>brought them up,</b> against their will. The Gemara explains: <b>And they disagree about</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar says: Ezra did not ascend from Babylonia until he made it like fine flour, and</b> only then <b>he ascended.</b>
<b>Abaye does not</b> accept the statement <b>of Rabbi Elazar,</b> since he maintains that they ascended of their own free will, whereas <b>Rava does accept</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Elazar.</b> Or, <b>if you wish, say that everyone accepts</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Elazar, and here they disagree with regard to this:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Abaye, <b>holds</b> that Ezra first <b>separated</b> the members of the community with flawed lineage, <b>and</b> they subsequently <b>ascended</b> to Eretz Yisrael out <b>of their own desire. And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rava, <b>holds</b> that <b>he brought them up against their will.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that the mishna means that <b>they ascended</b> of their own accord, without any distinction between the types of people who came, <b>this is</b> the reason <b>that Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The lineage of residents of <b>all lands is muddled</b> compared <b>to</b> that of <b>Eretz Yisrael, and</b> the lineage of residents of <b>Eretz Yisrael is muddled</b> compared <b>to</b> that of <b>Babylonia.</b> As the people came of their own accord, there was a lack of oversight concerning who married whom. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that <b>he brought them up,</b> and Ezra identified and selected all those who came with him, the Sages of the time <b>knew</b> the lineage of all who came and would have been careful not to allow any forbidden marriages, so why is the lineage of residents of Eretz Yisrael considered to be muddled compared to that of Babylonia? The Gemara answers: <b>Though</b> the status of those who came <b>was known to that generation, it was not known to other</b> later <b>generations.</b>
The Gemara asks another question: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that <b>they ascended</b> of their own accord, <b>this is</b> the meaning of the verse <b>that is written</b> in the book of Ezra: <b>“And I gathered them together to the river that runs to Ahava, and we camped there for three days; and I viewed the people and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi”</b> (Ezra 8:15), as it was necessary for Ezra to clarify the identity of the people traveling to Eretz Yisrael.
<b>But according to the one who says</b> that <b>he brought them up, they were careful</b> to classify the lineage of the people before they left for Eretz Yisrael, so why was it necessary for him to clarify the matter by the riverside? The Gemara answers: <b>Though they were careful with regard to</b> people of <b>flawed</b> lineage before they left for Eretz Yisrael, <b>with regard to</b> people of <b>unflawed</b> lineage <b>they were not careful</b> to clarify the precise lineage of each of them earlier, and they did this by the riverside.
§ The mishna included in its list of types of lineage <b>priests, Levites, and Israelites.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that they ascended?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the gatekeepers, and the Gibeonites dwelt in their cities, and all of Israel in their cities”</b> (Ezra 2:70). The verse specifies priests, Levites, and all of Israel.
The mishna further states that <b><i>ḥalalim</i>, converts, and emancipated slaves</b> ascended from Babylonia. The Gemara clarifies: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b><i>ḥalalim</i></b> ascended? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Great</b> is the importance of <b>a presumptive status, as it is stated: “And of the children of the priests: The children of Habaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name. These sought the registry of their genealogy, but it was not found. Therefore, they were deemed polluted and put out from the priesthood. And the Tirshatha said to them that they should not eat of the offerings of the most sacred order until there arose a priest with the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>”</b> (Ezra 2:61–63).
The <i>baraita</i> continues: This shows that there was uncertainty whether specific descendants of priests were fit for the priesthood or were <i>ḥalalim</i>, <b>and</b> Ezra <b>said to them: You have</b> retained <b>your presumptive status.</b> In other words, despite their failure to provide proof that they were fit priests, they maintained their prior status. Ezra said: <b>Of what</b> priestly gifts <b>did you partake</b> when you were <b>in exile?</b> You partook only <b>of the consecrated</b> gifts of <b>the boundaries,</b> i.e., from <i>teruma</i>, which may be eaten anywhere. <b>Here too,</b> in Eretz Yisrael, you may partake only <b>of the consecrated</b> gifts of <b>the boundaries.</b> You may not, however, partake of anything that must be eaten inside Jerusalem, as indicated by the verse “They should not eat of the offerings of the most sacred order.” In any event, since the verse writes that they were “put out from the priesthood,” it can be seen that there were <i>ḥalalim</i> who came with Ezra to Eretz Yisrael.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that <b>one elevates</b> a priest <b>to lineage,</b> i.e., one attributes the lineage of a priest to an individual on the basis of observing him partaking of <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> how could they be allowed to partake of <i>teruma</i>? <b>Those who partake of <i>teruma</i> will</b> subsequently <b>be elevated</b> to the full status of priests. The Gemara answers: <b>There it is different, as their presumptive status had been weakened.</b> Since they did not partake of offerings, as did all other priests, all knew that they were not regular priests.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>what</b> is the meaning of Rabbi Yosei’s claim that <b>great</b> is <b>a presumptive status?</b> They received nothing extra by virtue of this presumption. The Gemara responds: They have gained in <b>that initially they would partake of <i>teruma</i></b> only of Babylonian produce, which is <i>teruma</i> <b>by rabbinic law, and afterward they would partake of</b> produce that is <b><i>teruma</i> by Torah law.</b> The separation of <i>teruma</i> in Eretz Yisrael is a Torah obligation, and the produce is fully consecrated.
The Gemara offers an additional defense of the opinion that one elevates a priest to lineage based on observing him partake of <i>teruma</i>: <b>And if you wish, say: Actually, now also,</b> in Eretz Yisrael, <b>they would partake</b> only <b>of</b> produce that is <i>teruma</i> <b>by rabbinic law,</b> such as vegetables, while <b>they would not partake of</b> produce that is <i>teruma</i> <b>by Torah law,</b> such as grains. <b>And when we elevate</b> a priest <b>to lineage</b> on the basis of observing him partake of <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> that is only when he was observed partaking of produce that is <i>teruma</i> <b>by Torah law,</b> but if someone partakes of produce that is <i>teruma</i> <b>by rabbinic law, we do not elevate</b> him. Therefore, they could continue partaking of <i>teruma</i> based on their presumptive status, and there is no concern that they might be elevated to the status of full-fledged priests.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> the question remains: <b>What</b> is meant by the phrase: <b>Great</b> is <b>a presumptive status?</b> The Gemara answers: It means <b>that initially, there was no</b> reason <b>to decree</b> and prohibit them from partaking of produce that was <i>teruma</i> by rabbinic law <b>due to</b> the possibility that they may partake of produce that is <b><i>teruma</i> by Torah law,</b> as there was no produce that was <i>teruma</i> by Torah law in Babylonia. <b>Afterward,</b> when they came to Eretz Yisrael, <b>although there was reason to decree</b> and prohibit them from partaking of produce that was <i>teruma</i> by rabbinic law <b>due to</b> the possibility that they may partake of produce that was <b><i>teruma</i> by Torah law,</b> as that kind of <i>teruma</i> was also present, their presumptive status was nevertheless strong enough to allow them to continue <b>to partake of</b> produce that was <b><i>teruma</i> by rabbinic law,</b> although they could <b>not eat</b> produce that is <b><i>teruma</i> by Torah law.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “And the Tirshatha said to them that they should not eat of the offerings of the most sacred order [<i>kodesh hakodashim</i>]”</b> (Ezra 2:63)? This indicates that <b>it is from the offerings of the most sacred order that they may not eat, but anything</b> else, i.e., offerings not of the most sacred order, <b>they may eat,</b> including produce that is <i>teruma</i> by Torah law.
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what the Tirshatha <b>is saying:</b> They may <b>not</b> partake of <b>anything that is called sacred [<i>kodesh</i>], nor anything that is called most sacred [<i>kodashim</i>].</b> The Gemara clarifies. The words <b>not anything that is called sacred</b> are referring to <i>teruma</i>, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to <i>teruma</i>: <b>“No non-priest may eat of the sacred”</b> (Leviticus 22:10). And the words <b>nor anything that is called most sacred</b> are referring to offerings, <b>as the verse states: “And a daughter of a priest, if she is married to a non-priest, she may not eat of that which is set apart from the sacred things”</b> (Leviticus 22:12). <b>And the Master says:</b> What is the meaning of “that which is set apart from the sacred things”? It means <b>from</b> the portions <b>separated from the offerings,</b> i.e., the breast and thigh of a peace-offering,

Daf 70a

<b>she may not eat.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that <b>converts and emancipated slaves</b> ascended from Babylonia. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Rav Ḥisda says: As the verse states</b> with regard to the eating of the Paschal offering upon the return to Eretz Yisrael: “And the children of Israel who had come back from the exile ate, <b>and all such as had separated themselves to them from the impurity of the nations of the land</b> to seek the Lord, the God of Israel, did eat” (Ezra 6:21), indicating that converts and emancipated slaves who had abandoned “the impurity of the nations of the land,” i.e., idolatry, joined Ezra.
The mishna taught that <b><i>mamzerim</i></b> were among those who ascended from Babylonia. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard”</b> (Nehemiah 2:19), <b>and</b> elsewhere <b>it is written</b> with regard to Tobiah the Ammonite: <b>“For there were many in Judah sworn to him because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah”</b> (Nehemiah 6:18). The Gemara proceeds to explain: This <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that in the case of <b>a gentile or a slave who engaged in sexual intercourse with a Jewish woman, the offspring is a <i>mamzer</i>.</b> Since Tobiah the Ammonite, a gentile, married a Jewish woman, as did his son, there were clearly <i>mamzerim</i> among those who ascended.
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that in that case <b>the offspring is a <i>mamzer</i>. But according to the one who says</b> that the lineage of <b>the offspring is unflawed</b> and has the status of the mother, <b>what can be said? And furthermore, from where</b> is it clear <b>that</b> Jehohanan <b>had offspring</b> from this wife? <b>Perhaps he did not have offspring,</b> and it is possible that there were no <i>mamzerim</i>. <b>And furthermore,</b> even if they did have offspring, <b>from where</b> is it clear <b>that they had</b> offspring <b>here,</b> in Babylonia, who then <b>ascended</b> to Eretz Yisrael? <b>Perhaps they were there,</b> in Eretz Yisrael, all the time, as they may have been one of the families that was not exiled to Babylonia, and therefore they cannot be used as the proof that <i>mamzerim</i> ascended from Babylonia.
<b>Rather,</b> the proof that <i>mamzerim</i> were among those who ascended from Babylonia is <b>from here: “And these were they that ascended from Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer; but they could not tell their fathers’ houses, nor their offspring, whether they were of Israel”</b> (Nehemiah 7:61). The Gemara explains that these names are to be interpreted as follows: <b>“Tel Melah”; these are people whose</b> licentious <b>actions were similar to the act of Sodom, which was turned into a mound of salt [<i>tel melaḥ</i>]. “Tel Harsha”; this</b> is referring to one <b>who calls</b> a man <b>father, and his mother silences him,</b> as the word <i>ḥarsha</i> is similar to <i>maḥarishto</i>, meaning: Silences him. In any event, the statement that there were those who acted licentiously, as did the people of Sodom, means that there were <i>mamzerim</i> among them.
The Gemara continues with its explication of the verse: <b>“But they could not tell their fathers’ houses, nor their offspring, whether they were of Israel”; this</b> is referring to <b>a foundling who is gathered from the marketplace.</b> Such a person does not even know if he is Jewish, as he has no knowledge of his parents. With regard to the names <b>“Cherub, Addon, and Immer,” Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that these terms should be expounded as follows: <b>The Master [<i>Adon</i>],</b> God, <b>said: I said</b> that <b>the Jewish</b> people <b>shall be as important before Me as a cherub, but they made themselves</b> impudent <b>as a leopard [<i>namer</i>]. There are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version: <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: The Master [<i>Adon</i>] said</b> that <b>although they made themselves as a leopard [<i>namer</i>], they are as important before Me as a cherub.</b>
§ Explicating the same verse, <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says:</b> In the case of <b>anyone who marries a woman who is not suited for him</b> to marry due to her lineage, <b>the verse ascribes him</b> blame <b>as though he plowed [<i>ḥarash</i>] all</b> of <b>the entire world and sowed it with salt [<i>melaḥ</i>], as it is stated</b> with regard to those of flawed lineage who ascended from Babylonia: <b>“And these were they that ascended from Tel Melah, Tel Harsha.”</b>
<b>Rabba bar Rav Adda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> In the case of <b>anyone who marries a woman</b> of flawed lineage only <b>for the sake of money, he will have offspring</b> who will act <b>inappropriately, as it is stated: “They have dealt treacherously against the Lord, for they have begotten strange children;</b> now shall the new moon devour them with their portions” (Hosea 5:7).
Rabba bar Rav Adda explains the verse: <b>And lest you say</b> that at least the <b>money</b> that they received as dowry <b>was spared,</b> although they suffer from the acts of their offspring, <b>the verse states: “Now shall the new moon devour them with their portions,”</b> meaning their property shall be consumed in a single month. <b>And lest you say his portion</b> will be lost <b>but not the portion</b> of his wife, <b>the verse states “their portions”</b> in the plural. <b>And lest you say</b> this will occur <b>after a long time,</b> but in the interim he will benefit from the money, <b>the verse states: “The new moon.”</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred</b> that their money will be lost immediately? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: A month comes and a month goes, and their money is</b> already <b>lost.</b> In any event, the fact that the punishment they receive is the loss of their portions indicates that the sin in this case was marrying for the sake of money.
<b>And Rabba bar Rav Adda says, and some say Rabbi Salla says</b> that <b>Rav Hamnuna says:</b> In the case of <b>anyone who marries a woman who is not suited for him</b> to marry due to her lineage, <b>Elijah binds him</b> in the manner that those liable to receive lashes are bound, <b>and the Holy One, Blessed be He, straps him. And</b> a Sage <b>taught: Concerning all of them, Elijah writes and the Holy One, Blessed be He, signs</b> the following: <b>Woe to he who disqualifies his offspring, and who brings a flaw to his family</b> lineage, <b>and who marries a woman who is not</b> halakhically <b>suited for him</b> to marry. <b>Elijah binds him and the Holy One, Blessed be He, straps him.</b>
He further said: <b>And anyone who disqualifies</b> others by stating that their lineage is flawed, that is a sign that he himself <b>is</b> of <b>flawed</b> lineage. Another indication that one’s lineage is flawed is that <b>he never speaks in praise</b> of others. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> If one habitually claims that others are flawed, <b>he disqualifies</b> himself <b>with his</b> own <b>flaw.</b> The flaw he accuses them of having is in fact the one that he has.
§ The Gemara recounts a related incident: There was <b>a certain man from Neharde’a who entered a butcher shop in Pumbedita. He said to them: Give me meat. They said to him: Wait until the servant of Rav Yehuda bar Yeḥezkel has taken</b> his meat, <b>and</b> then <b>we will give</b> it <b>to you.</b> The man <b>said</b> to them in anger: <b>Who is</b> this <b>Yehuda bar Sheviske’el,</b> a derogatory name for a glutton for meat, <b>that he should precede me, that he should take before me? They went</b> and <b>told Rav Yehuda</b> what the man had said. Rav Yehuda <b>excommunicated him,</b> in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> of one who disparages a Torah scholar. <b>They</b> also <b>said</b> to him that the same man <b>was in the habit of calling people slaves.</b> Rav Yehuda <b>proclaimed about him that he is a slave</b> and may not marry a Jew.
The Gemara continues the story: <b>That</b> man <b>went and summoned</b> Rav Yehuda <b>to judgment before Rav Naḥman,</b> who was a judge in Neharde’a. When the <b>summons arrived</b> in Pumbedita, <b>Rav Yehuda went before Rav Huna</b> to seek his council. Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: Should I go or should I not go?</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him:</b> As for the obligation <b>to go, you are not required to go, since you are a great man</b> and therefore are not under the jurisdiction of Rav Naḥman’s court. <b>But due to the honor of the Exilarch’s house,</b> as Rav Naḥman was the son-in-law of the Exilarch, <b>get up</b> and <b>go.</b>
Rav Yehuda <b>arrived</b> in Neharde’a and <b>found</b> Rav Naḥman <b>constructing a parapet.</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>Does the Master not hold in accordance with that</b> <i>halakha</i> that <b>Rav Huna bar Idi says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Once a person has been appointed a leader of the community, he is prohibited from performing labor before three</b> people, so that he not belittle the honor of his position? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: It is</b> merely <b>a little fence [<i>gundarita</i>] that I am constructing.</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: Is</b> the term <b><i>ma’akeh</i>, which is written in the Torah, or</b> the corresponding term <b><i>meḥitza</i>, which the Sages said, distasteful</b> to you? Why do you use a term that is used by neither the Torah nor the Sages?
During their meeting, Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Let the Master sit on the bench [<i>karfita</i>].</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: Is</b> the term <b><i>safsal</i>, which the Sages said, or</b> the word <b><i>itzteva</i>, which</b> common <b>people say, distasteful</b> to you? Why are you using uncommon terms? Rav Naḥman then <b>said to him: Let the Master eat a citron [<i>etronga</i>].</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: This is what Shmuel said: Anyone who says <i>etronga</i></b> demonstrates <b>one-third of a haughtiness of spirit.</b> Why? He should <b>either</b> say <b><i>etrog</i>, as the Sages called it, or <i>etroga</i>, as</b> common <b>people say</b> in Aramaic. Saying <i>etronga</i> is a sign of snobbery, as it was employed by the aristocratic class. He subsequently <b>said to him: Let the Master drink a cup [<i>anbaga</i>]</b> of wine. Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: Is</b> the term <b><i>ispargus</i>, as the Sages called it, or <i>anpak</i>, as</b> common <b>people say, distasteful</b> to you?
Later on, Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Let</b> my daughter <b>Donag come</b> and <b>pour us drinks.</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: This is what Shmuel says: One may not make use of a woman</b> for a service such as this. Rav Naḥman replied: <b>She is a minor.</b> Rav Yehuda retorted: <b>Shmuel explicitly says: One may not make use of a woman at all, whether</b> she is <b>an adult or a minor.</b>
Later on, Rav Naḥman suggested: <b>Let the Master send</b> greetings of <b>peace to</b> my wife <b>Yalta.</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: This is what Shmuel says: A woman’s voice is</b> considered <b>nakedness,</b> and one may not speak with her. Rav Naḥman responded: It is <b>possible</b> to send your regards <b>with a messenger.</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: This is what Shmuel says:</b>

Daf 70b

<b>One may not send greetings to a woman</b> even with a messenger, as this may cause the messenger and the woman to relate to each other inappropriately. Rav Naḥman countered by suggesting that he send his greetings <b>with her husband,</b> which would remove all concerns. Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: This is what Shmuel says: One may not send greetings to a woman at all.</b> Yalta, <b>his wife,</b> who overheard that Rav Yehuda was getting the better of the exchange, <b>sent</b> a message <b>to him: Release him</b> and conclude your business with him, <b>so that he not equate you with another ignoramus.</b>
Desiring to release Rav Yehuda, Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: What is the reason</b> that <b>the Master is here?</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: The Master sent me a summons.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Now</b> that <b>I have not</b> even <b>learned the Master’s</b> form of <b>speech,</b> as you have demonstrated your superiority to me by reproving me even over such matters, <b>could I</b> have <b>sent a summons to the Master?</b> Rav Yehuda <b>removed the summons from his bosom and showed it to him.</b> While doing so, Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: Here is the man and here is the document.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Since the Master has come here, let him present his statement, in order that</b> people <b>should not say: The Sages flatter one another</b> and do not judge each other according to the letter of the law.
Rav Naḥman commenced the deliberation, and <b>said to him: What is the reason</b> that <b>the Master excommunicated that man?</b> Rav Yehuda replied: <b>He caused discomfort to an agent</b> of one <b>of the Sages,</b> and therefore he deserved the punishment of one who causes discomfort to a Torah scholar. Rav Naḥman challenged this answer: If so, <b>let the Master flog him, as Rav would flog one who causes discomfort to an agent of the Sages.</b> Rav Yehuda responded: <b>I</b> punished <b>him more severely than that.</b> Rabbi Yehuda held that excommunication is a more severe punishment than flogging.
Rav Naḥman further inquired: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>the Master proclaimed about him that he is a slave?</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to him:</b> Because he <b>is in the habit of calling people slaves, and</b> it <b>is taught: Anyone who disqualifies</b> others by stating that their lineage is flawed, that is a sign that he himself <b>is</b> of <b>flawed</b> lineage. Another indication of his lineage being flawed is that <b>he never speaks in praise</b> of others. <b>And Shmuel said: He disqualifies with his</b> own <b>flaw.</b> Rav Naḥman retorted: You can <b>say that Shmuel said</b> this <i>halakha</i> only <b>to</b> the degree that one should <b>suspect him</b> of being of flawed lineage. But <b>did he</b> actually <b>say</b> this <b>to</b> the extent that one could <b>proclaim about him</b> that he is of flawed lineage?
The Gemara continues the story: <b>Meanwhile, that litigant arrived from Neharde’a. That litigant said to Rav Yehuda: You call me a slave? I, who come from the house of the Hasmonean kings?</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: This is what Shmuel says: Anyone who says: I come from the house of the Hasmonean</b> kings, <b>is a slave.</b> As will be explained, only slaves remained of their descendants.
Rav Naḥman, who heard this exchange, <b>said to</b> Rav Yehuda: <b>Does the Master not hold in accordance with this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>that Rabbi Abba says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>any Torah scholar who proceeds to teach</b> a ruling of <b><i>halakha</i></b> with regard to a particular issue, <b>if he said it before an action</b> that concerns himself occurred, <b>they</b> should <b>listen to him,</b> and his ruling is accepted. <b>But if not,</b> if he quoted the <i>halakha</i> only after he was involved in an incident related to the <i>halakha</i> he is quoting, <b>they do not listen to him,</b> due to his personal involvement? Your testimony with regard to what Shmuel ruled should be ignored, as you stated it only after the incident. Rav Yehuda <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>There is Rav Mattana, who stands by my</b> report, since he has also heard this ruling of Shmuel.
The Gemara continues: <b>Rav Mattana had not seen</b> the city of <b>Neharde’a</b> for <b>thirteen years. That</b> very <b>day he arrived.</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to him:</b> Does <b>the Master remember what Shmuel said when he was standing</b> with <b>one foot on the bank and one foot on the ferry?</b> Rav Mattana <b>said to him: This is what Shmuel said</b> at that time: <b>Anyone who says: I come from the house of the Hasmonean</b> kings, <b>is a slave, as none remained of them except for that young girl who ascended to the roof and raised her voice and said:</b> From now on, <b>anyone who says: I come from the house of the Hasmonean</b> kings, <b>is a slave.</b> Other than this girl, the only members of the family who remained were descendants of Herod, and he was an Edomite slave.
The girl then <b>fell from the roof and died,</b> leaving only slaves from the Hasmoneans. With the confirmation of the report of the statement of Shmuel, <b>they</b> also <b>publicized</b> in Neharde’a <b>about him,</b> i.e., that man who claimed to come from the Hasmonean kings, <b>that he was a slave.</b>
The Gemara relates: On <b>that day, several marriage contracts were torn up in Neharde’a,</b> as many had their marriages annulled after having discovered that they had married slaves. <b>When</b> Rav Yehuda <b>was leaving</b> Neharde’a, <b>they pursued him,</b> seeking <b>to stone him,</b> as because of him it was publicized that their lineage was flawed. Rav Yehuda <b>said to them: If you are silent,</b> remain <b>silent. And if</b> you will <b>not</b> remain silent, <b>I will reveal about you this</b> statement <b>that Shmuel said: There are two</b> lines of <b>offspring in Neharde’a. One is called the dove’s house, and one is called the raven’s house. And your mnemonic</b> with regard to lineage is: The <b>impure</b> bird, the raven, is <b>impure,</b> meaning flawed, and the <b>pure</b> one, the dove, is <b>pure,</b> meaning unflawed. Upon hearing this, <b>they threw</b> all <b>those</b> stones that they were intending <b>to stone him</b> with <b>from their hands,</b> as they did not want him to reveal who had a flawed lineage. <b>And</b> as a result of all of the stones thrown into the river, <b>a dam arose in the Malka River.</b>
§ The Gemara continues the discussion of those with a flawed lineage: <b>Rav Yehuda proclaimed in Pumbedita: Adda and Yonatan,</b> known residents of that town, are <b>slaves; Yehuda bar Pappa</b> is a <b><i>mamzer</i>; Bati bar Tuviyya, in his arrogance, did not accept a bill of manumission</b> and is still a slave. <b>Rava proclaimed in</b> his city of <b>Meḥoza: Balla’ai, Danna’ai, Talla’ai, Malla’ai, Zagga’ai: All</b> these families <b>are</b> of <b>flawed</b> lineage. <b>Rav Yehuda</b> likewise <b>says: Gova’ai,</b> the inhabitants of a place called Gova, are in fact <b>Gibeonites,</b> and their name has been corrupted. Similarly, those people known as <b>Dorenunita</b> are from <b>the village of Gibeonites,</b> and they may not marry Jews with unflawed lineage. <b>Rav Yosef says:</b> With regard to <b>this</b> place called <b>Bei Kuvei of Pumbedita,</b> its residents <b>are all</b> descendants <b>of slaves.</b>
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Four hundred slaves, and some say four thousand slaves, were owned by Pashḥur ben Immer,</b> a priest in the time of Jeremiah, <b>and</b> due to their greatness <b>they were assimilated into the priesthood</b> and became known as priests. <b>And any priest who has</b> the trait of <b>insolence is only from them. Abaye said: They all sit in the rows</b> of honor <b>that are in</b> the city of <b>Neharde’a.</b> The Gemara comments: And this statement <b>disagrees with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar says: If you see an insolent priest, do not speculate about him</b> that he may be of flawed lineage, <b>since it is stated: “For your people are as those who strive with a priest”</b> (Hosea 4:4), which indicates that priests had a reputation for being cantankerous.
§ The Gemara discusses an idea raised earlier. <b>Rabbi Avin bar Rav Adda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> Concerning <b>anyone who marries a woman who is not suited for him</b> to marry, <b>when the Holy One, Blessed be He, rests His Divine Presence</b> upon the Jewish people, <b>He testifies with regard to all the tribes</b> that they are His people, <b>but He does not testify with regard to he</b> who married improperly, <b>as it is stated: “The tribes of the Lord, as a testimony to Israel”</b> (Psalms 122:4). <b>When is it a testimony to Israel? When the tribes are the tribes of the Lord,</b> but not when their lineage is flawed.
<b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: When the Holy One, Blessed be He, rests His Divine Presence, He rests it only upon families of</b> unflawed lineage <b>among Israel, as it is stated: “At that time, says the Lord, will I be the God of all the families of Israel”</b> (Jeremiah 30:25). <b>Of all Israel, is not stated, but “of all the families,”</b> which includes only those of unflawed lineage, the renowned families of Israel.
The verse from Jeremiah ends with the words <b>“And they shall be my people.” Rabba bar Rav Huna says: This is a higher standard</b> that differentiates <b>between</b> those born as <b>Jews and converts, as with regard to</b> those born as <b>Jews it is written about them: “And I will be their God, and they shall be My people”</b> (Ezekiel 37:27), <b>whereas with regard to converts it is written: “For who is he that has pledged his heart to approach unto Me? says the Lord. And you shall be My people, and I will be your God”</b> (Jeremiah 30:21–22). This teaches that converts are not drawn close to God, as indicated by the words “And I will be your God,” until they first draw themselves near to God, as indicated by the subsequent phrase “And you shall be my people.”
<b>Rabbi Ḥelbo says: Converts are</b> as <b>difficult for the Jewish people as a scab.</b> The proof is <b>that it is stated: “And the convert shall join himself with them, and they shall cleave [<i>venispeḥu</i>] to the house of Jacob”</b> (Isaiah 14:1). <b>It is written here “<i>venispeḥu</i>,” and it is written there,</b> among the types of leprosy: <b>“And for a sore and for a scab [<i>sappaḥat</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:56). The use of a term with a similar root indicates that converts are like a scab for the Jewish people.
<b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina says: When the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b>

Daf 71a

<b>purifies</b> the <b>tribes,</b> i.e., clarifies their lineage, He will <b>purify</b> that of <b>the tribe of Levi first, as it is stated</b> with regard to the angel sent forth by God: <b>“And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver; and there shall be they that shall offer to the Lord offerings in righteousness”</b> (Malachi 3:3).
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Money purifies <i>mamzerim</i>.</b> Money causes rich <i>mamzerim</i> to become assimilated with Jews of unflawed lineage, since other families marry them despite their flawed lineage. In the future, God will not single them out as <i>mamzerim</i>, <b>as it is stated: “And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver,”</b> which teaches that money, i.e., silver, purifies them. <b>What,</b> then, is the connection to the next part of the verse: <b>“They that shall offer to the Lord offerings in righteousness”? Rabbi Yitzḥak says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, performed</b> an act of <b>righteousness with the Jewish people</b> by establishing <b>that a family that has become assimilated</b> with Jews of unflawed lineage remains <b>assimilated.</b> They are not removed from their tribe despite their flawed lineage.
§ With regard to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> that was discussed earlier, the lineage of the Jews in various lands, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The lineage of residents of <b>all lands is muddled</b> compared <b>to</b> that of the residents of <b>Eretz Yisrael, and</b> the lineage of residents of <b>Eretz Yisrael is muddled</b> compared <b>to</b> that of <b>Babylonia.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>In the days of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>they sought to establish</b> the lineage of the Jews in <b>Babylonia</b> as <b>muddled</b> relative <b>to</b> that of <b>Eretz Yisrael.</b> In other words, the people of Eretz Yisrael wanted their lineage to be considered superior to that of the residents of Babylonia, so that if people from Eretz Yisrael would wish to marry Babylonians, they would have to investigate the lineage of the Babylonians. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was descended from Hillel, a Babylonian, so <b>he said to</b> those who put forth this suggestion: <b>Are you placing thorns between my eyes?</b> Do you wish to insult me? <b>If you wish, Rabbi Ḥanina bar Ḥama will join you</b> and explain it to you.
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Ḥama joined them</b> and <b>said to them: This</b> is the tradition that <b>I received from Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, who says in the name of his father,</b> who was from Eretz Yisrael: The lineage of residents of <b>all lands is muddled</b> compared <b>to</b> that of <b>Eretz Yisrael, and</b> the lineage of residents of <b>Eretz Yisrael is muddled</b> compared <b>to</b> that of <b>Babylonia.</b>
The Gemara further relates with regard to the same issue: <b>In the days of Rabbi Pineḥas, they sought to establish</b> the lineage of <b>Babylonia</b> as <b>muddled</b> relative <b>to</b> that of <b>Eretz Yisrael. He said to his servants: When I have said two statements in the house of study, pick me up on a stretcher and run,</b> so that I will not be attacked for my statements. <b>When he entered</b> the house of study <b>he said to</b> those studying there: <b>Slaughter of a bird is not</b> obligatory <b>by Torah law.</b>
<b>While they were sitting and scrutinizing this</b> novel <i>halakha</i>, <b>he said to them:</b> The lineage of residents of <b>all lands is muddled</b> compared <b>to</b> that of <b>Eretz Yisrael, and</b> the lineage of residents of <b>Eretz Yisrael is muddled</b> compared <b>to</b> that of <b>Babylonia.</b> His servants <b>picked him up on a stretcher and ran.</b> Those that were in the house of study <b>pursued him but could not catch him.</b> Nevertheless, <b>they sat and examined</b> the lineage of various families in order to determine whether in fact the lineage of the residents of Eretz Yisrael was problematic, <b>until they reached</b> powerful families. It was <b>dangerous</b> to accuse them of flaws due to their power, <b>and they withdrew</b> from their inspections.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> as an oath: By the <b>Sanctuary! It is in our power</b> to reveal the identity of a family that has a flawed lineage, <b>but what can I do, as the greatest of the generation are assimilated into it?</b> Consequently, I will not reveal its name. The Gemara comments: Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, as Rabbi Yitzḥak says: A family that has become assimilated</b> remains <b>assimilated,</b> and one should not reveal their flawed status.
<b>Abaye said: We too learn</b> in the mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 8:7): <b>There was a family</b> known as <b>Beit HaTzerifa in Transjordan, and</b> a person called <b>ben Tziyyon forcefully distanced it</b> and proclaimed that its lineage was flawed, although its lineage was unflawed. <b>There was another</b> one <b>that ben Tzion forcefully drew near,</b> although its lineage was flawed. The mishna adds: Known families <b>such as these, Elijah comes to</b> declare <b>impure and to</b> declare <b>pure, to distance and to draw near.</b> Abaye continues: When the mishna states: <b>Such as these,</b> it means those <b>whose</b> status <b>we know. But a family that has become assimilated,</b> whose flawed lineage is unknown to the public, <b>has</b> already <b>become assimilated,</b> and not even Elijah will publicize its flaw.
The Sage <b>taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Eduyyot</i> 3:4): <b>There was another</b> family with flawed lineage, <b>but the Sages did not want to reveal its</b> identity to all. <b>But the Sages transmit its</b> name <b>to their children and to their students once every seven years, and some say twice every seven years,</b> to prevent them from marrying into their family. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: It stands to reason in accordance with the one who says</b> that they transmit it <b>once every seven years, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Nazir</i> 1:2): One who says: <b>I am hereby a nazirite if I do not reveal</b> the names of <b>families</b> of flawed lineage among the Jewish people, <b>he should be a nazirite and not reveal</b> the identity of such <b>families.</b> This shows that such information should be kept secret as much as possible.
§ The above statement, concerning a matter that the Sages transmitted privately and infrequently, leads the Gemara to teach a similar <i>halakha</i>: <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The Sages transmit</b> the correct pronunciation of <b>the four-letter name</b> of God <b>to their students once every seven years, and some say twice every seven years. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: It stands to reason in accordance with the one who says</b> that they transmit it <b>once every seven years, as it is written: “This is My name forever [<i>le’olam</i>]”</b> (Exodus 3:15), which is <b>written</b> so that it can be read <b><i>le’alem</i>,</b> to hide. This indicates that the Divine Name must remain hidden. The Gemara relates: <b>Rava planned to expound</b> and explain the proper way to say the name <b>in</b> a public <b>discourse. A certain elder said to him: It is written</b> so that it can be read <b><i>le’alem</i>,</b> indicating that it must stay hidden.
<b>Rabbi Avina raised a contradiction: It is written: “This is My name,”</b> indicating that the name as written is that of God; <b>and it is written: “This is My remembrance”</b> (Exodus 3:15), which indicates that it is not God’s actual name but merely a way of remembering His name. The explanation is as follows: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Not as I am written am I pronounced. I am written with</b> the letters <b><i>yod</i>, <i>heh</i>,</b> <i>vav</i>, <i>heh</i>, <b>while</b> My name is <b>pronounced with</b> the letters <b><i>alef</i>, <i>dalet</i>,</b> <i>nun</i>, <i>yod</i>.
<b>The Sages taught: Initially,</b> the Sages <b>would transmit the twelve-letter name</b> of God <b>to any person. When the uninhibited ones</b> who used the name disrespectfully <b>increased, they would transmit it</b> only <b>to discreet</b> members <b>of the priesthood, and the discreet</b> members <b>of the priesthood</b> would pronounce the name during the Priestly Benediction. They would <b>conceal it</b> by saying it <b>during the sweet</b> melody <b>of their priestly brothers,</b> so that it would not become publicly known. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Tarfon,</b> who was himself a priest, <b>said:</b> On <b>one occasion I ascended after my mother’s brother to the platform</b> to give the Priestly Benediction, <b>and I inclined my ear near the High Priest, and I heard him conceal the name during the sweet</b> melody <b>of his priestly brothers.</b>
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: The forty-two-letter name</b> of God <b>may be transmitted only to one who is discreet, and humble, and stands at</b> at least <b>half his life, and does not get angry, and does not get drunk, and does not insist upon his rights</b> but is willing to yield. There is no concern that such a person might reveal the name in a fit of anger or drunkenness. <b>And anyone who knows</b> this name <b>and is careful with it and guards it in purity is beloved above and treasured below; and fear of him is cast upon the creatures; and he inherits two worlds, this world and the World-to-Come.</b>
§ The Gemara returns to the issue of lineage: <b>Shmuel says in the name of</b> a certain <b>elder:</b> A family in <b>Babylonia has a presumptive status of unflawed</b> lineage <b>until it becomes known to you in what way it was</b> rendered of <b>flawed</b> lineage. Conversely, a family from <b>other lands has a presumptive status of flawed</b> lineage <b>until it becomes known to you in what way it was</b> rendered <b>unflawed.</b> As for families in <b>Eretz Yisrael,</b> one who <b>has a presumptive status of flawed</b> lineage is of <b>flawed</b> lineage, whereas one who <b>has presumptive status of unflawed</b> lineage is of <b>unflawed</b> lineage.
The Gemara is puzzled by this last statement: <b>This matter itself is difficult:</b> First, <b>you said</b> that a family that <b>has a presumptive status of flawed</b> lineage is of <b>flawed</b> lineage, indicating that a family with <b>unspecified</b> status is of <b>unflawed</b> lineage. <b>And then</b> you <b>teach:</b> A family that <b>has a presumptive status of unflawed</b> lineage is of <b>unflawed</b> lineage, indicating that a family with <b>unspecified</b> status is of <b>flawed</b> lineage. <b>Rav Huna bar Taḥalifa said in the name of Rav:</b> This is <b>not difficult.</b>

Daf 71b

<b>Here,</b> in the final clause, it is referring <b>to marrying</b> a woman to <b>him,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> is that a family with no presumptive status requires investigation before one of them marries. <b>There,</b> in the penultimate clause, it is referring <b>to</b> the court <b>removing a woman from him.</b> The husband is not forced to divorce her unless it has been proven that they may not remain married.
<b>Rav Yosef says: Anyone whose speech is Babylonian,</b> i.e., anyone who speaks the Babylonian language with a Babylonian accent, <b>is</b> allowed <b>to marry a woman</b> without having his lineage examined. The presumption is that he is Babylonian, and the lineage of Babylonian families is unflawed. The Gemara comments: <b>But nowadays, when there are swindlers</b> who may speak with Babylonian accents in order to avoid scrutiny, <b>we are concerned</b> even about those who speak like Babylonians.
The Gemara relates: The Sage <b>Ze’eiri,</b> a Babylonian, <b>was avoiding Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who was from Eretz Yisrael, <b>since</b> the latter kept <b>saying to him: Marry my daughter. One day,</b> when <b>they were walking along the way, they arrived at</b> a large <b>puddle of water.</b> Ze’eiri <b>lifted Rabbi Yoḥanan upon his shoulders and carried him over</b> the puddle out of respect. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: Our Torah is fit</b> and worthy of honor in your eyes, and yet <b>our daughters are not fit? What is your reason</b> for not wanting to marry my daughter?
Rabbi Yoḥanan continued: <b>If we say a reason</b> not to marry my daughter is <b>from that which we learned</b> in a mishna (69a): There were <b>ten</b> categories of <b>lineage</b> among the Jews who <b>ascended from Babylonia: Priests, Levites,</b> Israelites, as well as many of flawed lineage, and you are concerned about the <i>mamzerim</i> among those who live in Eretz Yisrael, <b>is that to say</b> that <b>all of the priests, Levites, and Israelites ascended</b> to Eretz Yisrael? Certainly, Jews of unflawed lineage remained in Babylonia. <b>Just as there remained from these</b> unflawed categories in Babylonia, <b>there also remained</b> individuals <b>from these,</b> the flawed categories. Therefore, marrying only Babylonians will not alleviate your concern. The Gemara comments: In fact, <b>this statement of Rabbi Elazar escaped</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>Ezra did not ascend from Babylonia until he made it like fine flour, and</b> then <b>he ascended.</b> Accordingly, the people who remained in Babylonia were all of unflawed lineage.
The Gemara relates another incident: <b>Ulla arrived in Pumbedita to the house of Rav Yehuda. He observed that Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, was grown up and was unmarried.</b> Ulla <b>said to</b> Rav Yehuda: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>the Master does not marry a woman to his son?</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: Do I know from where I</b> can find a woman <b>to marry</b> him? I am concerned about flawed lineage. Ulla <b>said to him: Is that to say that we know where we come from?</b> Can we be sure that our lineage is unflawed? <b>Perhaps</b> we are <b>from those</b> about <b>whom it is written: “They have ravished the women in Zion, the maidens in the cities of Judah”</b> (Lamentations 5:11). Perhaps we are descended from women ravished by gentiles.
<b>And if you would say</b> that you are not concerned about that possibility, since you maintain that in the case of <b>a gentile or a slave who engaged in sexual intercourse with a Jewish woman,</b> the lineage of <b>the offspring is unflawed, perhaps</b> we come <b>from those about whom it is written: “That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches”</b> (Amos 6:4), <b>and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says</b> in explanation of this verse: <b>These are people who urinate naked before their couches.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Abbahu ridiculed this</b> interpretation and said: <b>If so,</b> if this was their sin, <b>is this what is written: “Therefore now shall they go captive at the head of them that go captive”</b> (Amos 6:7)? Could it be that <b>because they urinated naked before their couches</b> that <b>they go captive at the head of them that go captive?</b> That act is admittedly distasteful, but it is not so severe a transgression to warrant such a punishment.
<b>Rather, Rabbi Abbahu says: These are people who eat and drink together, and attach their beds together, and exchange their wives with each other, and befoul their couches with semen that is not theirs.</b> The Jewish people include the descendants of such people, who are full-fledged <i>mamzerim</i>.
<b>Rav Yehuda said to</b> Ulla: If so, <b>what shall we do?</b> How can we clarify which families are of unflawed lineage? Ulla <b>said to him: Go after the silence, like the way the people of the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>examine: When two</b> people <b>quarrel with each other, they observe which of them becomes silent first.</b> Then <b>they say: This</b> silent party <b>is of finer lineage.</b>
<b>Rav says: The silence of Babylonia is its lineage.</b> In other words, this is an effective method of examining a person’s lineage in Babylonia as well. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But Rav arrived at the house of the son of a vinegar strainer and examined them. What, is it not</b> that he conducted an examination <b>into</b> their <b>lineage?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> he conducted an examination <b>into their silence. This is</b> what Rav <b>said to</b> those conducting the examination: <b>Examine whether they become silent</b> when they quarrel <b>or</b> whether <b>they do not become silent.</b>
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: If you see two people feuding with each other, there is a trace of unfitness in one of them.</b> In other words, there are grounds to suspect that the lineage of one of them is flawed. Consequently, that one <b>is prevented</b> by Heaven <b>from joining the other</b> through marriage, and that leads them to feud with each other. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: If you see two families feuding with each other, there is a trace of unfitness in one of them, and</b> that family <b>is prevented</b> by Heaven <b>from joining the other.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa the Elder says in the name of Rav: Babylonia</b> is <b>healthy</b> with regard to lineage and clear of suspicion. <b>Mishon</b> is <b>dead,</b> meaning that all its inhabitants have flawed lineage. <b>Media</b> is <b>sick,</b> and <b>Eilam</b> is <b>moribund.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>And what</b> is the difference <b>between sick and moribund? Most sick</b> people recover <b>to</b> a healthy <b>life,</b> whereas <b>most</b> of those who are <b>moribund</b> are destined <b>for death.</b> Likewise, the majority of the residents of Media had unflawed lineage, while the majority of those living in Eilam had flawed lineage.
After having determined that those from Babylonia are presumed to have unflawed lineage, the Gemara clarifies what the borders of Babylonia are with regard to this issue. <b>Until where does</b> the width of <b>Babylonia</b> extend? <b>Rav said: Until the River Azak,</b> which empties into the Euphrates. <b>And Shmuel said: Until the River Yo’ani,</b> which also empties into the Euphrates. The Gemara asks: <b>Until where does</b> the border extend <b>upward,</b> meaning northward, <b>on the Tigris? Rav said: Until</b> the places called <b>Bagda and Avna. And Shmuel said: Until Mushekanei.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to Shmuel, <b>isn’t Mushekanei included</b> in Babylonia? <b>But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba say</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Mushekanei is like the exile,</b> meaning it is like Pumbedita in central Babylonia, <b>with regard to lineage? Rather,</b> Shmuel meant: <b>Until and including Mushekanei.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>How far does</b> the border extend <b>downward,</b> meaning southward, <b>on the Tigris? Rav Shmuel said: Until</b> the city of <b>Lower Appamya.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>There are two</b> cities called <b>Appamya, the upper one and the lower one.</b> In terms of the lineage of their residents, <b>one is unflawed and the other is flawed, and they are separated by</b> a distance of <b>a parasang [<i>parsa</i>]. And they are particular with regard to one another.</b> The residents of the two cities avoid each other to the extent that <b>they do not even loan each other fire,</b> to prevent them from developing a closeness with each other. <b>And your mnemonic</b> to remember which is which is that <b>the unfit one</b> is <b>that</b> one <b>that speaks the Mishon dialect.</b> As stated above, Mishon is considered dead with regard to lineage.
The Gemara further clarifies: <b>How far does</b> the border extend <b>upward,</b> meaning northward, <b>on the Euphrates? Rav said: Until the fortress</b> of <b>Tulbaknei. And Shmuel said: Until the bridge over the Euphrates. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Until the crossing at Gizma.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>Abaye would curse, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Yosef</b> that would curse, <b>one</b> who ruled in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rav,</b> as he held that Rav extended the border too far north.
The Gemara is puzzled by this statement: Why did he <b>curse one</b> who ruled in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rav,</b> but he <b>did not curse one</b> who ruled in accordance with the opinion <b>of Shmuel?</b> But the bridge over the Euphrates is further north than the fortress of Tulbaknei. <b>Rather,</b> he <b>would curse one</b> who ruled in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rav, and all the more so one</b> who ruled in accordance with the opinion <b>of Shmuel. And if you wish, say: In fact, he cursed one</b> who ruled in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rav,</b> but <b>he did not curse one</b> who ruled in accordance with the opinion <b>of Shmuel, and the bridge over the Euphrates</b> actually <b>stood lower down,</b> i.e., farther south. In their times the bridge was to the south of Tulbaknei, and Abaye agreed that it was in Babylonia.

Daf 72a

<b>And it is</b> only <b>now</b> that <b>the Persians moved</b> the bridge further <b>up</b> northward. <b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: Until where does</b> the border extend <b>on this</b> western <b>side of the Euphrates? Rav Yosef said to him: What are you thinking?</b> Why do you ask? Is it <b>due to</b> the town of <b>Biram?</b> Even <b>those of</b> pure <b>lineage</b> who live in <b>Pumbedita marry</b> women <b>from Biram,</b> which demonstrates that the residents of Biram are presumed to have unflawed lineage.
<b>Rav Pappa says: Just as</b> there is <b>a dispute</b> between Rav and Shmuel as to the northern border of Babylonia with regard <b>to lineage, so</b> is there <b>a dispute with regard to bills of divorce.</b> An agent bringing a bill of divorce from a country overseas to Eretz Yisrael must state that it was written and signed in his presence. If he brought it from Babylonia, there is no requirement for him to state this. Rav Pappa is teaching that the borders that define Babylonia with regard to this issue are the same as the borders with regard to lineage. <b>And Rav Yosef says:</b> This <b>dispute</b> is <b>with regard to lineage, but with regard to bills of divorce, everyone agrees</b> that it is considered Babylonia <b>up to the second lake of the bridge</b> that Shmuel mentioned.
<b>Rami bar Abba said:</b> The province of <b>Ḥaveil Yamma is the glory of Babylonia</b> with regard to lineage; <b>Shunya and Guvya</b> are <b>the glory of Ḥaveil Yamma. Ravina said:</b> The town of <b>Tzitzora</b> is <b>also</b> like Shunya and Guvya. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Ḥanan ben Pineḥas says: Ḥaveil Yamma is the glory of Babylonia; Shunya and Guvya and Tzitzora</b> are <b>the glory of Ḥaveil Yamma. Rav Pappa says: And nowadays, Samaritans have assimilated with them,</b> and their lineage is problematic. The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> that <b>is not so.</b> Rather, one Samaritan <b>requested</b> to marry <b>a woman from them and they would not give</b> her <b>to him,</b> which led to the rumor that Samaritans had assimilated with them. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is this region called <b>Ḥaveil Yamma? Rav Pappa said: This</b> is the area near the <b>Euphrates</b> adjacent <b>to Bursi.</b>
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who said to</b> the Sages: <b>I am from</b> a place called <b>Shot Mishot. Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa stood on his feet and said: Shot Mishot is located between the</b> Tigris and Euphrates <b>Rivers.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And if it is located between the rivers, what of it?</b> What <i>halakha</i> is this relevant for? <b>Abaye said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Ukva says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> The area <b>between the rivers is like the exile,</b> meaning Pumbedita, <b>with regard to lineage.</b> The Gemara inquires: <b>And where is</b> the area between the rivers <b>located</b> for the purpose of this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From Ihi Dekira and upward,</b> i.e., northward. The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: Until the crossing at Gizma</b> but no further? <b>Abaye said: A strip extends</b> from that region past Ihi Dekira.
<b>Rav Ika bar Avin says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥananel says</b> that <b>Rav says: Ḥillazon Nihavnad is like the exile with regard to lineage. Abaye said to them: Do not listen to</b> Rav Ika bar Avin about this, as <b>it was a <i>yevama</i></b> who <b>fell before him</b> from <b>there</b> to perform levirate marriage, and he said that its lineage was unflawed because he wished to marry her. Rav Ika bar Avin <b>said to him: Is that to say</b> that this <i>halakha</i> <b>is mine? It is Rav Ḥananel’s,</b> and it is not reasonable to say that I was influenced by my own interests in stating it. <b>They went and asked Rav Ḥananel. He said to them: Rav said as follows: Ḥillazon Nihavnad is like the exile with regard to lineage.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this <b>disagrees</b> with the statement <b>of Rabbi Abba bar Kahana, as Rabbi Abba bar Kahana says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> with regard to the exile of the ten tribes of the kingdom of Israel: <b>“And he put them in Halah, and in Habor, on the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes”</b> (II Kings 18:11)? <b>Halah is Ḥillazon; Habor is Hadyav; the river of Gozan is Ginzak; the cities of the Medes are Ḥamadan and its neighboring towns, and some say: This is Nihavnad and its neighboring towns.</b> Since the ten tribes assimilated with the gentiles, the lineage of Jews from those places is flawed, unlike that which was taught before.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> are the <b>neighboring towns</b> of Nihavnad? <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <b>city</b> of <b>Mushekhei, Ḥosekei, and Rumekei. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And</b> all of these are the same with regard <b>to flawed</b> lineage. <b>It was assumed</b> that <b>Mushekhei is</b> the same as <b>Mushekanei.</b> The Gemara therefore asks: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin say</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Mushekanei is like the exile with regard to lineage? Rather,</b> it must be that <b>Mushekhei is discrete, and Mushekanei is discrete.</b>
In connection to the aforementioned places, the Gemara analyzes the following verse, describing a vision of a bear-like animal: <b>“And it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth”</b> (Daniel 7:5). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This is Ḥillazon, Hadyav, and Netzivin, which</b> the Persian government <b>sometimes swallows and sometimes discharges.</b> In other words, control over these places passed from the Persians to the Romans and back again several times.
The first part of that verse stated: <b>“And behold a second beast, similar to a bear”</b> (Daniel 7:5). <b>Rav Yosef taught: These are Persians, who eat and drink</b> copious amounts <b>like a bear, and are corpulent like a bear, and grow hair like a bear, and have no rest like a bear,</b> which is constantly on the move from one place to another. <b>When Rabbi Ami saw a Persian riding, he would say: This is a bear on the move.</b>
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to Levi: Show me Persians,</b> i.e., describe a typical Persian to me. Levi <b>said to him:</b> They <b>are similar to the legions of the house of David.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said: <b>Show me Ḥabbarin,</b> Persian priests. Levi said to him: They <b>are similar to angels of destruction.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said: <b>Show me Ishmaelites.</b> Levi said to him: They <b>are similar to demons of an outhouse.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said: <b>Show me Torah scholars of Babylonia.</b> Levi said to him: They <b>are similar to ministering angels.</b>
<b>When Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>was dying, he said</b> prophetically: <b>There is</b> a place called <b>Homanya in Babylonia,</b> and <b>all its</b> people are the sons <b>of Ammon. There is</b> a place called <b>Masgariya in Babylonia,</b> and <b>all its</b> people are <b><i>mamzerim</i>. There is</b> a place called <b>Bireka in Babylonia,</b> and <b>there are two brothers</b> there <b>who exchange wives with each other,</b> and their children are therefore <i>mamzerim</i>. <b>There is</b> a place called <b>Bireta DeSatya in Babylonia. Today they turned away from the Omnipresent.</b> What did they do? <b>A ditch with fish overflowed, and they went and trapped</b> the fish <b>on Shabbat. Rabbi Aḥai, son of Rabbi Yoshiya, excommunicated them, and they</b> all <b>became apostates. There is</b> a place called <b>Akra DeAgma in Babylonia. There is</b> a man named <b>Adda bar Ahava there.</b>

Daf 72b

<b>Today he is sitting in the lap of Abraham</b> our forefather, since he has just been circumcised. He added: <b>Today Rav Yehuda was born in Babylonia.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>As the Master said: While Rabbi Akiva was dying, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>was born; while Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>was dying, Rav Yehuda was born; while Rav Yehuda was dying, Rava was born; while Rava was dying, Rav Ashi was born.</b> This <b>teaches you that a righteous person does not leave the world before an equally righteous person is created, as it is stated: “The sun also rises and the sun also sets”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:5). The same applies to earlier generations: <b>Before Eli’s sun had gone out, Samuel the Ramathite’s sun was</b> already <b>rising, as it is stated: “And the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying</b> in the Temple of the Lord” (I Samuel 3:3), which teaches that Samuel was already prophesying in the days of Eli.
The Gemara stated above that Homanya is an Ammonite city. The verse states: <b>“The Lord has commanded concerning Jacob, that they that are round about him should be his adversaries”</b> (Lamentations 1:17), indicating that the Jewish people are surrounded by enemies even in its exile. <b>Rav Yehuda says: Homanya</b> is close to <b>Pum Nahara,</b> which had Jewish residents.
The verse states: <b>“And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said: Ah Lord God!”</b> (Ezekiel 11:13). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed with regard to the meaning of this verse. <b>One said</b> it should be interpreted <b>for good, and one said</b> it should be interpreted <b>for evil.</b> How so? <b>The one who says</b> that it should be interpreted <b>for good</b> claims it is <b>like that</b> story involving <b>the governor [<i>de’istandera</i>]</b> of the province <b>of Meishan, who was the son-in-law of Nebuchadnezzar. He sent</b> a message <b>to</b> his father-in-law: <b>From all those captives you have brought for yourself</b> from your wars <b>you have not sent us</b> anyone <b>to stand before us.</b>
Nebuchadnezzar <b>wanted to send him</b> captives <b>from the Jews</b> to serve his son-in-law. <b>Pelatiah, son of Benaiah, said to</b> Nebuchadnezzar: <b>We, who are important, shall stand</b> and serve <b>before you here, and our slaves will go there,</b> to your son-in-law. Nebuchadnezzar took his advice. <b>And</b> about him the prophet <b>Ezekiel said: One who did</b> this <b>good for the Jewish people,</b> i.e., Pelatiah ben Benaiah, who spared them this exile, should he <b>die at half</b> of <b>his days?</b>
<b>The one who says</b> that the verse should be interpreted <b>for evil</b> cites the following verse, <b>as it is written: “Then a spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the Lord’s House, which looked eastward; and behold, at the door of the gate five and twenty men; and I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people”</b> (Ezekiel 11:1), <b>and it is written: “And He brought me into the inner court of the Lord’s House, and, behold, at the door of the Temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the Temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the east”</b> (Ezekiel 8:16).
The second verse is analyzed in light of the first verse, which states that Pelatiah ben Benaiah was among the twenty-five people: <b>From the</b> fact that <b>it is stated: “And their faces toward the east,” don’t I know that their backs were toward the west,</b> where the Temple was? <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Their backs toward the Temple of the Lord”?</b> These words hint at another matter, as the verse <b>teaches that they exposed themselves</b> from behind <b>and discharged</b> excrement <b>toward</b> the One <b>above,</b> in the direction of the Temple. <b>And</b> the <b>prophet is saying:</b> Shall <b>he who did this evil in Israel die</b> peacefully <b>on his bed?</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>It may be concluded</b> that it was <b>Shmuel</b> who <b>said</b> this was <b>for evil, as Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Mushekanei is like the exile with regard to lineage.</b> And even with regard to <b>Mishon, they were not concerned due to slavery nor due to <i>mamzer</i> status. Rather, the priests who were there were not particular with regard to</b> the prohibition against priests marrying <b>divorced women.</b> Consequently, Shmuel maintains that the only flaw of lineage in Mishon was that of <i>ḥalalim</i>, whereas the opinion that the verse was stated for good maintains that the some of the residents of Mishon were slaves.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Actually, I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that <b>Shmuel said</b> it was <b>for good, and</b> there is no contradiction, since <b>Shmuel</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he says:</b> With regard to one <b>who renounces ownership of his slave,</b> the slave <b>is emancipated and he does not</b> even <b>require a bill of manumission.</b> Shmuel cited a proof from that <b>which is stated:</b> “But <b>every slave man that is bought for money”</b> (Exodus 12:44). Does this apply only to <b>a slave</b> who is <b>a man, and not to a woman slave? Rather,</b> it means: The slave of a man, i.e., <b>a slave whose master has authority</b> and control <b>over him, is called a slave,</b> since he is the slave of a particular man. <b>A slave whose master does not have authority over him,</b> such as one who has been declared ownerless, <b>is not called a slave</b> but a freeman. The slaves who went to Mishon no longer had the status of slaves because their masters remained behind.
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: This</b> mishna, which indicates that only the inhabitants of Babylonia have unflawed lineage, is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. But the Rabbis say: All lands retain a presumptive status of unflawed</b> lineage.
The Gemara comments: <b>Ameimar permitted Rav Huna bar Natan to marry a woman from Meḥoza,</b> which is outside the borders of Babylonia as pertains to lineage. <b>Rav Ashi said to</b> Ameimar: <b>What is your reasoning</b> in allowing him to do so? Is it because <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: This</b> is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir, but the Rabbis say all lands retain a presumptive status of unflawed</b> lineage. The <i>halakha</i> follows the opinion of the Rabbis, <b>but the school of Rav Kahana did not teach like this, and the school of Rav Pappa did not teach like this, and the school of Rav Zevid did not teach like this.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Nevertheless,</b> despite hearing of all these reports, Ameimar <b>did not accept this <i>halakha</i> from him, because he had heard this</b> <i>halakha</i> directly from <b>Rav Zevid of Neharde’a,</b> upon whom he relied.
<b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 5:5): <b><i>Mamzerim</i> and Gibeonites</b> will be <b>pure in the future;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei. Rabbi Meir says: They</b> will <b>not</b> be <b>pure. Rabbi Yosei said to him: But hasn’t it already been stated: “And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean</b> from all your uncleanness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you” (Ezekiel 36:25)? <b>Rabbi Meir said to him: When it says: “From all your uncleanness, and from all your idols,”</b> this emphasizes that God will purify people from these types of impurity, <b>but not from <i>mamzer</i> status. Rabbi Yosei said to him: When it says: “Will I cleanse you,”</b> at the end of the verse, <b>you must say</b> this means <b>even from <i>mamzer</i> status.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, according to Rabbi Meir,</b> who maintains that <i>mamzerim</i> will not be purified, <b>this is as it is written: “And a <i>mamzer</i> shall dwell in Ashdod”</b> (Zechariah 9:6), indicating that they will have their own isolated living area. <b>But according to Rabbi Yosei, what</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“And a <i>mamzer</i> shall dwell in Ashdod”?</b> The Gemara answers: He understands that verse <b>as Rav Yosef would translate</b> it: <b>The Jewish people shall dwell in tranquility in their land, where they were</b> formerly <b>like strangers,</b> reading <i>mamzer</i> as <i>me’am zar</i>, from a strange people.
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> that <i>mamzerim</i> and Gibeonites will be pure in the future. <b>Rav Yosef says: If it were not</b> for the fact that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, Elijah would come</b> and <b>remove from us group after group</b> of <b>forbidden people [<i>kolarin</i>],</b> since he would reveal how many <i>mamzerim</i> there are among the Jewish people.
<b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 5:3): <b>A convert may marry a <i>mamzeret</i></b> <i>ab initio</i>; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei. Rabbi Yehuda says: A convert may not marry a <i>mamzeret</i>. A convert, an emancipated slave, and a <i>ḥalal</i> are</b> all <b>permitted to</b> marry <b>the daughter of a priest.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Yosei,</b> who deems it permitted for a convert to marry a <i>mamzeret</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>Five congregations are written,</b> meaning, the word congregation appears five times in the Torah with regard to various people of flawed lineage who are prohibited from entering the congregation of God.

Daf 73a

<b>One</b> is referring <b>to priests,</b> to teach that people with flawed lineage may not enter their congregation; <b>and one</b> is referring <b>to Levites; and one to Israelites; and one</b> serves <b>to permit a <i>mamzer</i> to</b> marry <b>a <i>shetuki</i>,</b> since a <i>mamzer</i> is prohibited from entering only the congregation of God, but he may marry someone who is not definitely a member of the congregation, e.g., a <i>shetuki</i>; <b>and one</b> serves <b>to permit a <i>shetuki</i> to</b> marry <b>an Israelite,</b> as only one who is a definite <i>mamzer</i> may not marry an Israelite. As for the <b>congregation of converts, it is not called a congregation</b> at all, and they may marry those prohibited from entering the congregation of Israel. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda</b> holds that <b>priests and Levites are derived from one</b> instance of the word <b>“congregation,”</b> since they are from the same tribe, that of Levi. Consequently, one instance of the word “congregation” <b>remains for him</b> to interpret. He interprets it as referring <b>to the congregation of converts,</b> and deems it prohibited for a <i>mamzer</i> to enter that congregation as well.
<b>And if you wish, say: So too,</b> Rabbi Yehuda agrees with Rabbi Yosei that Levites and priests <b>are two congregations,</b> since there are special <i>halakhot</i> of marriage that apply only to priests. Rather, Rabbi Yehuda holds that the permissibility of the marriage of <b>a <i>mamzer</i> with a <i>shetuki</i> and a <i>shetuki</i> with an Israelite</b> is <b>derived from one</b> instance of the word <b>“congregation,”</b> from the verse: <b>“A <i>mamzer</i> shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:3).
This is accomplished by inferring the following: <b>It is</b> one who is <b>a definite <i>mamzer</i> who may not enter, but</b> one who is <b>a <i>mamzer</i></b> as a result <b>of an uncertainty,</b> e.g., a <i>shetuki</i>, <b>may enter. And similarly, it is into the congregation</b> of those with <b>definite</b> unflawed lineage that a <i>mamzer</i> <b>may not enter, but into a congregation</b> of those with <b>uncertain</b> lineage, e.g., a <i>shetuki</i>, <b>he may enter.</b> This verse therefore teaches that both types of marriage are permitted. In any event, Rabbi Yehuda remains with one instance of the word “congregation” to interpret, from which he derives that it is also prohibited for a convert to marry a <i>mamzeret</i>.
<b>And if you wish, say: These too,</b> one who is a definite <i>mamzer</i> and one who is a <i>mamzer</i> as the result of an uncertainty, <b>are two congregations,</b> each requiring its own verse, <b>and the reason of Rabbi Yehuda is from here: “As for the congregation, there shall be one statute both for you, and for the stranger that sojourns with you”</b> (Numbers 15:15), which indicates that converts are considered like Israelites with regard to their being included in the category of “congregation.” <b>And according to Rabbi Yosei,</b> who holds that a convert may marry a <i>mamzeret</i>, the phrase <b>“one statute” interrupts the matter,</b> and converts are not considered part of the congregation of God.
§ The Gemara comments: The statement of the <i>Tosefta</i> that <b>a convert, and an emancipated slave, and a <i>ḥalal</i> are all permitted to</b> marry <b>the daughter of a priest supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rav, as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Women of unflawed</b> lineage who are daughters of priests <b>were not prohibited</b> from <b>marrying those disqualified</b> from the priesthood <b>due to flawed lineage [<i>ḥalalim</i>],</b> since that prohibition applies only to male priests.
<b>Rabbi Zeira taught in Meḥoza:</b> It is <b>permitted</b> for <b>a convert to</b> marry <b>a <i>mamzeret</i>. Everyone stoned him with their <i>etrogim</i>,</b> since the many converts present were insulted by his statement, which they understood to mean that converts are not members of God’s congregation. <b>Rava said: Is there</b> a person <b>who teaches such a matter in a place where there are commonly converts?</b> He should have been more circumspect. <b>Rava</b> himself <b>taught</b> this <b>in Meḥoza</b> to ameliorate the situation: It is <b>permitted</b> for <b>a convert to</b> marry <b>the daughter of a priest. They carried him on silk [<i>beshira’ei</i>]</b> for elevating the honor of converts. <b>He later taught them:</b> It is <b>permitted</b> for <b>a convert to</b> marry <b>a <i>mamzeret</i>. They said to him: You have forfeited</b> the honor of your <b>first</b> sermon. Rava <b>said to them: I have done for you what is good for you. If</b> a convert <b>wishes,</b> he may <b>marry from here,</b> i.e., from those of pure lineage, <b>and if he wishes,</b> he may <b>marry from here,</b> i.e., a <i>mamzeret</i>.
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is: It is <b>permitted</b> for <b>a convert to</b> marry <b>the daughter of a priest, and</b> it is <b>permitted</b> for him <b>to</b> marry <b>a <i>mamzeret</i>.</b> It is <b>permitted</b> for <b>a convert to</b> marry <b>the daughter of a priest,</b> since <b>women of unflawed</b> lineage <b>were not prohibited</b> from <b>marrying those disqualified</b> for the priesthood. <b>And</b> it is <b>permitted</b> for him <b>to</b> marry <b>a <i>mamzeret</i>, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who holds that the congregation of converts is not called a congregation.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And these are</b> the last two categories: <b>A <i>shetuki</i></b> is <b>any</b> person <b>who knows</b> the identity of his mother but does not know the identity of his father. <b>Rava says: By Torah law, a <i>shetuki</i> is fit</b> to enter the congregation. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Most are fit with regard to her,</b> i.e., most men are fit to engage in intercourse with an unmarried woman, <b>and</b> only <b>a minority are unfit with regard to</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>her.</b> There are few men who are related to a woman in a way that would render the offspring <i>mamzerim</i>.
Rava analyzes two possibilities: <b>And if they came to her,</b> i.e., if the father came to the mother’s location when the child was conceived, the following principle with regard to an uncertain prohibition takes effect: <b>Anything that separates</b> from its fixed location is presumed to have <b>separated from the majority</b> of items like it in that location. If the father separated from the population at large and came to the mother, one can assume that he was from the majority, who are of unflawed lineage. <b>What</b> might <b>you say,</b> that <b>perhaps she went to them,</b> and the child was conceived in the place where the father was? In such a case, <b>it is</b> an uncertain prohibition located in its <b>fixed</b> place, <b>and</b> the halakhic principle is: <b>Anything fixed is considered</b> as though it were <b>half and half,</b> i.e., fifty percent, and it remains a case of uncertainty, and it should be prohibited for the <i>shetuki</i> to marry a Jew with unflawed lineage.
<b>And</b> in any case, this does not suffice to prevent her <i>shetuki</i> child from marrying a Jew with unflawed lineage, since <b>the Torah states: “A <i>mamzer</i> shall not enter</b> into the congregation of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 23:3), which indicates: <b>It is a definite <i>mamzer</i> who may not enter, but</b> one who is <b>a <i>mamzer</i></b> as a result <b>of an uncertainty may enter.</b> Similarly, <b>it is into a congregation</b> of those with <b>definite</b> unflawed lineage that <b>he may not enter, but into a congregation</b> of those with <b>uncertain</b> lineage <b>he may enter.</b> Therefore, even if it is uncertain if one is a <i>mamzer</i>, by Torah law he may marry a Jew with unflawed lineage.
<b>And for what reason did</b> the Sages nevertheless <b>say</b> that <b>a <i>shetuki</i></b> is of <b>flawed</b> lineage? Due to a rabbinic <b>decree, lest he marry his sister from his father,</b> since the identity of his father is unknown. The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> it <b>should not</b> be permitted for <b>a <i>shetuki</i></b> to <b>marry</b> even <b>a female <i>shetuki</i>, lest he marry his sister from his father.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>And do</b> people <b>engage in licentiousness to such an extent</b> that one should be concerned that all the children of unknown paternity in one city were fathered by the same man? By the same reasoning, there should also be a decree that a <i>shetuki</i> may <b>not marry the daughter of a female <i>shetuki</i></b> from a proper marriage, <b>lest he marry his sister from his father,</b> since the man who married the female <i>shetuki</i> might have been his father. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>it is not common</b> for a <i>shetuki</i> to happen to marry his sister, and therefore he may marry the daughter of a female <i>shetuki</i>. <b>So too, it is not common</b> for him to happen to marry his sister, and the Sages would not issue a decree to prevent this from occurring.
The question therefore remains, why did they render it prohibited for a <i>shetuki</i> to marry a Jew with unflawed lineage? The Gemara answers that it is not prohibited for a <i>shetuki</i> to marry a Jew with unflawed lineage due to any halakhic concern. <b>Rather,</b> the Sages <b>established a higher standard with regard to lineage,</b> in that they rendered it prohibited for people from unknown backgrounds to marry those with unflawed lineage.
<b>And Rava says</b> a similar statement: <b>By Torah law, a foundling,</b> a child found in the marketplace whose parents are unknown, <b>is fit,</b> and there is no concern that the child is a <i>mamzer</i>. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>A married woman</b> who becomes pregnant through extramarital intercourse, which results in the child being a <i>mamzer</i>, <b>ascribes</b> the child <b>to her husband.</b> Since everyone assumes that her husband is the father, she has no reason to abandon the child in the marketplace. <b>What</b> case <b>is there</b> where a mother would want to abandon her <i>mamzer</i> child? There is the <b>minority</b> of situations involving <b>betrothed women</b> who committed adultery but cannot claim that her betrothed is the father, as they had not been living together. <b>And</b> there is the <b>minority</b> of women <b>whose husbands have gone overseas</b> and could not have fathered the children.
<b>Since there are</b> many other cases of <b>unmarried</b> women who do abandon their children although those children have unflawed lineage, <b>and there are also</b> children with unflawed lineage who are abandoned by their parents <b>due to hunger,</b> the concern that the child is a <i>mamzer</i> <b>is</b> no more than <b>half and half,</b> i.e., fifty percent. <b>And the Torah states: “A <i>mamzer</i> shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:3), which indicates: <b>It is</b> one who is <b>a definite <i>mamzer</i> who may not enter, but</b> one who is <b>a <i>mamzer</i></b> as a result <b>of an uncertainty may enter.</b> Similarly, <b>it is into a congregation</b> of those with <b>definite</b> unflawed lineage that <b>he may not enter, but into a congregation</b> of those with <b>uncertain</b> lineage <b>he may enter.</b> This child is a <i>mamzer</i> as the result of an uncertainty, and by Torah law may marry a Jew with unflawed lineage.
<b>And for what reason did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that <b>a foundling is unfit? Lest he marry his sister from his father.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> it <b>should not</b> be permitted for <b>a foundling</b> to <b>marry</b> even a female <b>foundling, lest he marry his sister from either his father or his mother.</b> The Gemara rejects this: Are they <b>continually throwing away all these</b> children? Is it likely that the same parents abandoned both a son and a daughter? If you accept that suggestion, it <b>should not</b> be permitted for <b>him</b> to <b>marry the daughter of a foundling, lest he marry his sister,</b> as perhaps the father of the one he wishes to marry is his father as well. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>it is not common</b> for a foundling to happen to marry his sister, and therefore he may marry the daughter of a foundling. <b>So too, it is not common</b> for him to happen to marry his sister, and the Sages would not make a decree to prevent this from occurring.
The question therefore remains: Why did they prohibit a foundling from marrying a Jew with unflawed lineage? The Gemara answers that it is prohibited for a foundling to marry a Jew with unflawed lineage not due to any halakhic concern. <b>Rather,</b> the Sages <b>established a higher standard with regard to lineage,</b> in that they rendered it prohibited for people from unknown backgrounds to marry those with unflawed lineage.
§ <b>Rava bar Rav Huna says:</b> If an abandoned boy was <b>found circumcised,</b>

Daf 73b

<b>he is not subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling.</b> If the baby’s lineage were unfit, his parents would not have gone to the trouble of circumcising him. Likewise, if <b>his limbs are adjusted,</b> indicating that he was cared for after birth, <b>he is not subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling.</b> Similarly, if he was <b>anointed with oil, or</b> if his eyes <b>were smeared with</b> eye <b>salve,</b> or if he was <b>adorned with rings,</b> or if <b>a note [<i>pitka</i>] was hanging</b> on him, <b>or</b> if <b>an amulet was hanging</b> on him, <b>he is not subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling.</b>
Concerning a child found <b>hanging from a palm tree, if</b> he was in such a place that <b>an animal could reach him, he is subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling. If not,</b> if he was placed on a palm tree in a way that he could not be reached by an animal, <b>he is not subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling,</b> since he was cared for enough to be placed in a safe location.
Similarly, if the child was placed in <b>a thicket near a town,</b> where people are not commonly found, <b>he is subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling. But if not, he is not subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling.</b> If the child was discovered <b>in a synagogue near a town, and people are commonly found there, he is not subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling,</b> since the parents wanted to give him to others. <b>But if not,</b> if the synagogue was not near a town or if it was not frequented by people, <b>he is subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling.</b>
<b>Ameimar said:</b> With regard to <b>this cistern into which date pits are placed [<i>peira desuflei</i>]</b> as animal fodder, if a child is found there, <b>he is subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling.</b> If he was found <b>in the middle of</b> a fast-flowing <b>river</b> with boats passing by, <b>he is not subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling.</b> If he was placed <b>at the side</b> of the river, <b>he is subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling.</b> If he was found at <b>the sides of a public domain,</b> which is not frequented by many people, <b>he is not subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling.</b> But if the child was discovered in <b>the public domain</b> itself, where he might easily be trampled, <b>he is subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling.</b>
<b>Rava said: And in famine years, he is not subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling.</b> The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>this</b> statement <b>of Rava, to which</b> specific case is it referring? <b>If we say</b> it is referring <b>to the</b> case where the child was left in the <b>public domain because it is a famine year,</b> would a mother <b>kill him</b> by placing him in a place where he is likely to be trampled? <b>Rather,</b> if Rava’s statement is referring <b>to the</b> case where the child was found at the <b>sides of a public domain, why specifically</b> mention <b>famine years? Even when</b> it is <b>not famine years,</b> the child was placed in a safe location where he was likely to be found.
<b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>when Rava’s</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>was stated,</b> it was stated <b>with regard to that which Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda bar Zavdi says</b> that <b>Rav says: As long as</b> the abandoned child is still <b>in the marketplace, his father and mother are deemed credible with regard to him</b> when they later claim the child as theirs. But once the child has been <b>collected from the marketplace, they are no</b> longer <b>deemed credible with regard to him.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Rava said: Since</b> the child <b>has</b> already <b>been publicized with the name of</b> being of flawed lineage as <b>a foundling,</b> they cannot change the status of the child. <b>And</b> it is with regard to this <i>halakha</i> that <b>Rava says: And in famine years, although</b> the child <b>has been collected from the marketplace, his father and mother are deemed credible with regard to him,</b> as it is common even for parents of unflawed lineage to abandon their children in famine years, and it is likely that they are speaking the truth.
§ <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> There are <b>three</b> cases where people <b>are deemed credible</b> if they <b>immediately</b> offer testimony with regard to a matter about which they are not ordinarily deemed credible to testify. <b>These are they: A foundling, a midwife, and one who exempts her friends</b> from uncertain impurity.
How so? The case of <b>a foundling</b> is <b>that which we said,</b> that his parents can testify with regard to his lineage before he is collected from the marketplace.
The case of <b>a midwife</b> is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A midwife is deemed credible to say</b> that <b>this</b> child <b>emerged first</b> from the womb <b>and that</b> child <b>emerged second</b> from the womb. Her testimony is relied upon to determine which of them is the firstborn. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? When she has not left</b> the birthing room <b>and returned. But if she left</b> the birthing room <b>and returned, she is not deemed credible,</b> since the babies might have been exchanged in the meantime. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> If <b>she has stood in her place, she is deemed credible. But if not, she is not deemed credible.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between them?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The difference between them</b> is in a case <b>when</b> the midwife <b>turned her head</b> aside after the birth. According to Rabbi Eliezer she is no longer deemed credible, despite having remained in the room.
<b>What is</b> the case of <b>one who exempts her friends? As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 60b): If there were <b>three women who were sleeping in one bed, and blood was found beneath one of them, they are all</b> deemed <b>impure</b> as menstruating women, as it is not known from which of them the blood came. If <b>one of them examined</b> herself <b>and was found</b> to be <b>impure,</b> i.e., she saw that she was menstruating, <b>she is impure and all</b> the rest <b>are pure.</b> With regard to this, <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> This applies provided <b>that she examined herself</b> within the <b>period of time</b> needed for the onset of <b>menstruation,</b> i.e., immediately after the discovery of the blood. But if she did so even a short while later, her discovery is not accepted as proof with regard to the source of the blood.
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If several women gave birth at the same time, the <b>midwife</b> is <b>deemed credible to say: This</b> baby <b>is a priest and that</b> baby <b>is a Levite; this</b> baby <b>is a Gibeonite and that</b> baby <b>is a <i>mamzer</i>.</b> In other words, she is deemed credible to say which baby was born to which mother. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? When no objection was registered about it. But if an objection was registered about it, she is not deemed credible.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>An objection of what</b> type? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>an objection of one</b> witness claiming that her testimony is not accurate, <b>but doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: There is no objection</b> with <b>less than two</b> witnesses? <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> must refer to the <b>objection of two</b> witnesses, but she is deemed credible when contradicted by a single witness.
<b>And if you wish, say: Actually, I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that she is not deemed credible even when contradicted by the <b>objection of one</b> witness, <b>and when Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that <b>there is no objection</b> with <b>less than two</b> witnesses, <b>that statement</b> applies <b>only</b> in a case <b>where there is a presumption of validity,</b> which can be countered only by the objection of two witnesses. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where there is no presumption</b> of <b>validity,</b> such as in this case, when the baby was just born, <b>one</b> witness <b>is also deemed credible</b> to object.
Similarly, if the <b>owner of</b> an item being <b>purchased</b> is confronted by two people, each claiming to have purchased the item, he is <b>deemed credible to say: I sold to this</b> one, <b>and I did not sell to that</b> one. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? When the</b> item being <b>purchased is</b> still <b>in</b> the seller’s <b>possession. But if the</b> item being <b>purchased is not in his possession, he is not deemed credible</b> any more than a single witness is.

Daf 74a

The Gemara asks: <b>And let us see from whom he took the money,</b> as it will be obvious that he is the one who bought it. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>took</b> money <b>from both of them, and</b> he then <b>said: One</b> payment I accepted <b>willingly, and one</b> payment was given to me <b>against my will, and it is not known which</b> person gave him money in accordance <b>with his will and which</b> did so <b>against his will.</b> In that case, if the item is no longer in the seller’s possession, he is not deemed credible to testify to whom he sold it.
The Gemara cites the continuation of the <i>baraita</i>: Similarly, <b>a judge</b> is <b>deemed credible to say: I found this</b> person <b>victorious</b> in a civil case, <b>and I found this one obligated</b> to pay. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? When the litigants are</b> still <b>standing before him. But if the litigants are not standing before him</b> but have left, <b>he is not deemed credible.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And let us see who holds the writ of a favorable verdict.</b> Why is there a need to rely on the statement of the judge?
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where their writs of a favorable verdict have been torn up</b> and cannot be examined. The Gemara asks: If so, <b>then let him return and judge them</b> again, and presumably the same verdict will be issued. The Gemara answers: It was a case <b>of the judges’ discretion [<i>shuda dedayyanei</i>].</b> In certain cases, the verdict depends on the decision of the judges based solely on their sense of which litigant deserves to win. There is no guarantee that they will make the same decision the second time around.
The Gemara continues to discuss the credibility of various people with regard to a firstborn. <b>Rav Naḥman says: Three are deemed credible with regard to</b> stating that a child is <b>a firstborn,</b> and <b>they are: A midwife, his father, and his mother. A midwife</b> is deemed credible only <b>immediately; his mother</b> is deemed credible <b>all</b> of the first <b>seven</b> days after his birth; <b>his father</b> is deemed credible <b>forever. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Expounding the verse: “But <b>he shall acknowledge</b> the firstborn” (Deuteronomy 21:17), the Sages said: The father <b>shall acknowledge him to others.</b> In other words, he is deemed credible to tell others that this is his firstborn.
<b>From here, Rabbi Yehuda said: A person</b> is <b>deemed credible to say: This</b> is <b>my firstborn son. And just as he</b> is <b>deemed credible to say: This</b> is <b>my firstborn son, so</b> too, if he is a priest he is <b>deemed credible to say</b> about his son: <b>This</b> is <b>a son of a divorced woman, or: This</b> is <b>a son of a <i>ḥalutza</i>. And the Rabbis say:</b> As far as these latter claims are concerned, <b>he is not deemed credible.</b> He is deemed credible to state only which son is his firstborn.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Abba Shaul would call a <i>shetuki</i></b> by the label of <b><i>beduki</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>beduki</i>? If we say that they examine [<i>bodekin</i>] his mother, and</b> if <b>she says: I engaged in sexual intercourse with</b> a man of <b>unflawed</b> lineage, in which case <b>she is deemed credible,</b> then <b>with whose</b> opinion does this <i>halakha</i> accord? <b>With</b> that of <b>Rabban Gamliel.</b> But <b>we</b> already <b>learned</b> this <b>on another occasion, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 13a): If an unmarried woman <b>was pregnant, and they said to her: What is the status of this fetus,</b> and <b>she said to them:</b> It is <b>from so-and-so, and he is a priest,</b> then <b>Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Eliezer say:</b> She is <b>deemed credible, and Rabbi Yehoshua says: We don’t live from,</b> i.e., we don’t rely on, the words of <b>her mouth,</b> and she is not trusted. <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel.</b> What, then, did Abba Shaul add beyond what was taught in that mishna?
The Gemara answers: Abba Shaul’s statement that the woman is deemed credible when she states that the father of the child was of unflawed lineage is nevertheless necessary. <b>One</b> <i>halakha</i> was stated in order <b>to render her fit</b> to marry a priest, <b>and one</b> <i>halakha</i> was stated <b>to render her daughter fit</b> to marry a priest as well. The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says:</b> According <b>to the statement of the one who deems her fit</b> to marry a priest, <b>he</b> nevertheless <b>deems her daughter unfit,</b> as her credibility does not extend to her daughter, who never had a presumptive status of unflawed lineage. Abba Shaul therefore presents a novel ruling, that if she claims to have engaged in intercourse with a man of unflawed lineage, she is deemed credible even with regard to the status of her daughter.
<b>But according to the one who says:</b> According <b>to the statement of the one who deems her fit</b> to marry a priest, <b>he deems her daughter fit</b> to do so as well, <b>what is Abba Shaul coming to teach us?</b>
The Gemara answers: The statement <b>of Abba Shaul</b> is <b>preferable</b> and is more far-reaching than <b>that of Rabban Gamliel, as, if</b> the <i>halakha</i> were learned only <b>from there,</b> the case of an unmarried woman, <b>I would say: There</b> it is a case when <b>most are fit with regard to her,</b> as it is permitted for most people to engage in intercourse with a single woman. <b>But</b> in a circumstance <b>where most are unfit with regard to her,</b> e.g., if she was betrothed and claimed that the man betrothed to her was the father, you might <b>say</b> this: She is <b>not</b> deemed credible when she claims to have engaged in intercourse with a man that would result in the child being of unflawed lineage, as only a small minority of people, i.e., her betrothed, would not render the child unfit, while the rest of the people in the world would render him unfit. Therefore, Abba Shaul’s <i>halakha</i> was <b>necessary</b> in order to include that case. <b>Rava says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Abba Shaul.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All those</b> for <b>whom it is prohibited to enter into the congregation,</b> i.e., to marry a Jew of unflawed lineage, <b>are permitted to marry</b> into <b>each other’s</b> families. <b>Rabbi Yehuda prohibits</b> them from marrying anyone other than those who share their specific flaw.
<b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> It is <b>permitted</b> for <b>those</b> with <b>definite</b> flaws to marry <b>with those</b> with <b>definite</b> flaws. For example, it is permitted for <i>mamzerim</i> and Gibeonites to marry each other. By contrast, it is <b>prohibited</b> for <b>those</b> with <b>definite</b> flaws, such as <i>mamzerim</i>, to marry <b>with those</b> whose flaws result from <b>an uncertainty,</b> such as a child of unknown paternity [<i>shetuki</i>] and a foundling; <b>and</b> it is prohibited for <b>those</b> whose flaws result from <b>an uncertainty</b> to marry <b>with those</b> with <b>definite</b> flaws; <b>and</b> it is prohibited for <b>those</b> whose flaws result from <b>an uncertainty</b> to marry <b>with those</b> whose flaws result from <b>an uncertainty,</b> such as a <i>shetuki</i> and a female <i>shetuki</i>. <b>And these are the</b> ones whose flaws result from <b>an uncertainty: A <i>shetuki</i>, a foundling, and a Samaritan.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>All those</b> for <b>whom it is prohibited to enter into the congregation? If we say <i>mamzerim</i> and Gibeonites, <i>shetukim</i>, and foundlings, wasn’t it</b> already <b>taught in the first clause</b> of the first mishna of the chapter that with regard to <b><i>mamzerim</i> and Gibeonites, <i>shetukim</i>, and foundlings,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> for men and women in these categories <b>to marry</b> into <b>each other’s</b> families?
<b>And furthermore, to which</b> case in the mishna here is it referring when it states: <b>Rabbi Yehuda prohibits</b> them? <b>If we say</b> it is referring <b>to those</b> with <b>definite</b> flaws marrying <b>with those</b> whose flaws result from <b>an uncertainty,</b> and it is teaching that Rabbi Yehuda prohibits them from marrying each other, this is difficult. <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that it teaches</b> in the <b>latter clause</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> It is <b>permitted</b> for <b>those</b> with <b>definite</b> flaws to marry <b>with those</b> with <b>definite</b> flaws; by contrast, it is <b>prohibited</b> for <b>those</b> with <b>definite</b> flaws to marry <b>with those</b> whose flaws result from <b>an uncertainty, and</b> it is prohibited for <b>those</b> whose flaws result from <b>an uncertainty</b> to marry <b>with those</b> with <b>definite</b> flaws, <b>and</b> it is prohibited for <b>those</b> whose flaws result from <b>an uncertainty</b> to marry <b>with those</b> whose flaws result from <b>an uncertainty;</b> then <b>by inference, it is clear</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda does not maintain</b> this opinion.
<b>And if you would say</b> that when <b>Rabbi Yehuda prohibits</b> those with flawed lineage from marrying each other, he is referring <b>to</b> the prohibition against <b>a convert</b> marrying <b>with a <i>mamzeret</i>, does</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a convert</b> marrying <b>with a <i>mamzeret</i>? It teaches: All those</b> for <b>whom it is prohibited to enter into the congregation,</b> which does not include a convert.
<b>Rav Yehuda says:</b>

Daf 74b

<b>This is</b> what the mishna <b>is saying: All those</b> for <b>whom it is prohibited to enter into the congregation of the priesthood.</b> Rav Yehuda adds parenthetically: And <b>who are they?</b> Even a female who became <b>a convert</b> at <b>less than three years and one day</b> old, <b>and</b> this is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai,</b> who holds that such a girl is permitted to marry a priest. Rav Yehuda resumes his presentation of the statement of Rabbi Yehuda: They <b>are permitted to marry</b> into those families that are prohibited from entering into the congregation but are permitted to marry <b>one another.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And let us establish</b> the mishna as referring <b>to</b> a girl who became a convert at <b>three years and one day</b> old or older, <b>and</b> then it will accord <b>even with Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai’s</b> opinion, as he agrees that this convert may not marry a priest. The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> the mishna <b>is broken,</b> i.e., contradicted, <b>from</b> within <b>itself,</b> as if the mishna states that even a female who converted when she was older than three years and a day may marry one with flawed lineage, one would make an incorrect inference, as follows.
<b>Rather, the reason</b> that she may marry one with flawed lineage is <b>that</b> she converted when she was already <b>three years and one day</b> old. <b>But</b> if she converted when she was <b>less than three years and one day</b> old, <b>as she is permitted to enter into the congregation of the priesthood,</b> is <b>she prohibited from marrying</b> into those families that are prohibited from entering into the congregation but are permitted to marry <b>one another?</b> This cannot be, <b>since according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai,</b> there is also the case of a female who converted when she was <b>less than three years and one day</b> old, <b>who is permitted to enter the congregation of the priesthood and</b> is also <b>permitted to marry</b> into those families that are prohibited from entering into the congregation but are permitted to marry <b>one another.</b> Consequently, the mishna cannot be explained to accord with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai.
The Gemara continues to ask: <b>But is it</b> an established <b>principle</b> that <b>all those</b> for <b>whom it is prohibited to enter into the congregation of the priesthood are permitted to marry</b> into those families that are prohibited from entering into the congregation but are permitted to marry <b>one another? But a widow,</b> who may not marry a High Priest, <b>and a divorcée, and a woman disqualified from marrying a priest [<i>ḥalala</i>], and a woman who has engaged in sexual intercourse with a man forbidden to her by the Torah [<i>zona</i>], are prohibited to enter into the congregation of the priesthood and are</b> also <b>prohibited to marry</b> into those families that are prohibited from entering into the congregation but are permitted to marry <b>one another. And furthermore,</b> can it be inferred: <b>But</b> one who <b>is permitted</b> to enter into the congregation of the priesthood is <b>prohibited</b> from marrying a man of flawed lineage? <b>But</b> there is the <b>convert,</b> who <b>is permitted to</b> marry <b>a daughter of a priest, and is</b> also <b>permitted to</b> marry <b>a <i>mamzeret</i>.</b>
<b>Rather, Rav Natan bar Hoshaya said: This is</b> what the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>is saying: Any</b> person about whom the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that a priest may not marry his daughter.</b> Rav Natan bar Hoshaya adds parenthetically: <b>And who is that? A convert who married a female convert, and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov,</b> who prohibits the daughter of two converts to marry a priest. Rav Natan bar Hoshaya resumes his presentation of the statement of Rabbi Yehuda: People of that status <b>are permitted to marry</b> into those families that are prohibited from entering into the congregation but are permitted to marry <b>one another,</b> since converts are not in the category of “congregation.”
The Gemara asks: <b>But is it</b> an established <b>principle</b> that <b>anyone whose daughter a priest may not marry</b> is <b>permitted to marry</b> into those families that are prohibited from entering into the congregation but are permitted to marry <b>one another? But</b> there is the case of <b>a priest disqualified due to flawed lineage [<i>ḥalal</i>] who married a Jewish woman, as a priest may not marry his daughter,</b> since she is a <i>ḥalala</i>. <b>And</b> despite this, she is included among those who <b>are prohibited to marry</b> into those families that are prohibited from entering into the congregation but are permitted to marry <b>one another.</b> The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> since this mishna <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dostai ben Yehuda,</b> who holds that the daughter of a <i>ḥalal</i> and a Jewish woman may marry a priest.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> there is the case of <b>a <i>ḥalal</i> who married a <i>ḥalala</i>, as a priest may not marry his daughter,</b> since she is a <i>ḥalala</i>. <b>And</b> despite this, she is included among those who <b>are prohibited to marry</b> into those families that are prohibited from entering into the congregation but are permitted to marry <b>one another. And furthermore,</b> can it be inferred: One with regard to whom it is <b>permitted</b> for a priest to marry his daughter, is he <b>prohibited</b> from marrying Jews of flawed lineage? <b>But</b> there is the case of <b>a convert who married a Jewish woman, and a priest is permitted to marry his daughter. And</b> despite this, people of that status <b>are permitted to marry</b> into those families that are prohibited from entering into the congregation but are permitted to marry <b>one another.</b>
<b>Rather, Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said</b> a different explanation of the dispute between the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Yehuda: <b>Here,</b> the difference <b>between them</b> concerns <b>a <i>mamzer</i></b> resulting <b>from</b> intercourse between a man and <b>his sister, and a <i>mamzer</i></b> resulting <b>from</b> intercourse between <b>a married woman</b> and a man other than her husband.
The <b>first <i>tanna</i> holds: Even a <i>mamzer</i></b> resulting <b>from</b> intercourse between a man and <b>his sister is also</b> considered <b>a <i>mamzer</i>. And Rabbi Yehuda holds:</b> The offspring resulting <b>from</b> intercourse with <b>a married woman is a <i>mamzer</i>,</b> but offspring resulting <b>from</b> intercourse between a man and <b>his sister is not a <i>mamzer</i>.</b> According to this explanation, the dispute is that according to the first <i>tanna</i>, offspring resulting from intercourse between siblings may marry offspring resulting from intercourse with a married woman, while according to Rabbi Yehuda, the offspring resulting from intercourse between siblings is of unflawed lineage and may not marry a <i>mamzer</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaching us</b> with this? <b>We</b> already <b>learned</b> this in a mishna (<i>Yevamot</i> 49a): <b>Who is a <i>mamzer</i>? Any</b> offspring <b>who is</b> born of a union prohibited by the verse: <b>“He shall not enter”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:2). In other words, if the union was a violation of any kind of prohibition, even that of a prohibition that is not subject to the punishment of <i>karet</i>, the child is a <i>mamzer</i>; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b>
The mishna continues: <b>Shimon HaTimni says: Any</b> offspring <b>who</b> is born of a union enjoined by a prohibition <b>for which one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> at the hand of Heaven, and the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with his statement. Rabbi Yehoshua says: Any</b> offspring <b>who</b> is born of a union enjoined by a prohibition <b>for which one is liable to</b> receive <b>court</b>-imposed <b>capital punishment.</b> This demonstrates that the question of whether <i>mamzer</i> status results from sexual intercourse between siblings, for which one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> rather than capital punishment, has already been addressed in a mishna. Therefore, Rav Naḥman’s explanation of this mishna must be rejected.
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The difference <b>between them</b> involves the <i>halakha</i> of a male <b>Ammonite and</b> a male <b>Moabite convert, and this is what</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: All those</b> for <b>whom it is prohibited to enter into the congregation.</b> Rava adds parenthetically: And <b>who are they?</b> A male <b>Ammonite and</b> a male <b>Moabite convert.</b> Rava resumes his presentation of the statement of Rabbi Yehuda: They <b>are permitted to marry one another.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what is</b> the reason of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> for <b>prohibiting</b> these marriages? Rabbi Yehuda should also permit an Ammonite convert to marry a <i>mamzeret</i>, as an Ammonite is not fit to enter the congregation. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: Although Rabbi Yehuda</b> generally <b>prohibits a convert from</b> marrying <b>a <i>mamzeret</i>, this matter</b> applies only to a regular <b>convert, who is fit to enter into the congregation. But</b> a male <b>Ammonite</b> convert <b>and</b> a male <b>Moabite convert, who are not fit to enter into the congregation,</b> are <b>not</b> prohibited from marrying a <i>mamzeret</i>, and there is no dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the first <i>tanna</i>.
<b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Yevamot</i> 8:1): A boy <b>nine years and one day</b> old, whose sexual intercourse is considered an act of intercourse with regard to sexual transgressions, who was <b>an Ammonite or Moabite convert,</b> or <b>an Egyptian or Edomite</b> convert, or <b>a Samaritan, or a Gibeonite, a <i>ḥalal</i>, or a <i>mamzer</i>,</b> and <b>who engaged in sexual intercourse with the daughter of a priest, or the daughter of a Levite, or an Israelite woman, has</b> thereby <b>disqualified her from the priesthood. Rabbi Yosei says: Anyone whose offspring is unfit</b> to marry a priest <b>disqualifies</b> a woman with whom he engages in intercourse from marrying a priest; <b>and anyone whose offspring is not unfit does not disqualify</b> her. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b>

Daf 75a

<b>Anyone whose daughter you may marry, you may marry his widow.</b> If a priest is permitted to marry someone’s daughter, he is likewise permitted to marry that person’s widow; she has not become disqualified to marry a priest by having engaged in sexual intercourse with her husband. <b>And anyone whose daughter you may not marry, you may not marry his widow</b> either.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> difference <b>is there between the first <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna <b>and Rabbi Yosei,</b> as they appear to be saying the same thing? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The practical difference <b>between them</b> concerns a Jewish woman who engaged in intercourse with <b>a second</b>-generation <b>Egyptian.</b> The Torah prohibits Egyptian converts and their children from entering into the congregation by marriage, but the grandchildren of the Egyptian convert, i.e., the third generation, are permitted to marry Jews with unflawed lineage. <b>And both of them learned</b> their respective opinions <b>only from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a High Priest</b> who engaged in intercourse <b>with a widow,</b> although they derived the <i>halakha</i> in different ways.
How so? As <b>the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that this case is <b>like</b> that of <b>a High Priest</b> who engages in sexual intercourse <b>with a widow: Just as</b> with regard to <b>a High Priest</b> who engages in intercourse <b>with a widow, his</b> act of <b>intercourse</b> with her is performed <b>by</b> means of <b>a transgression and he disqualifies her</b> from marrying into the priesthood, <b>so too anyone whose</b> act of <b>intercourse</b> is <b>by</b> means of <b>a transgression,</b> such as a second-generation Egyptian who engages in intercourse with a Jewish woman, likewise <b>disqualifies her</b> from marrying into the priesthood.
<b>And Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that the derivation is as follows: It is <b>like a High Priest</b> who engages in sexual intercourse <b>with a widow: Just as</b> with regard to <b>a High Priest</b> who engages in intercourse <b>with a widow, whose offspring is unfit</b> for the priesthood, as they have the status of a <i>ḥalal</i>, <b>and he</b> similarly <b>disqualifies</b> her from marrying a priest by engaging in intercourse with her, <b>so too, anyone whose offspring is unfit</b> for the priesthood also <b>disqualifies</b> her from marrying a priest by engaging in intercourse with her. This comparison serves <b>to exclude a second</b>-generation <b>Egyptian, whose offspring is not unfit, as the verse states: “The children of the third generation that are born to them may enter into the congregation of the Lord”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:9). Therefore, a second-generation Egyptian does not disqualify a woman with whom he engages in intercourse from marrying a priest.
The <i>baraita</i> also taught that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Anyone whose daughter you may marry, you may marry his widow. And anyone whose daughter you may not marry, you may not marry his widow</b> either. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> difference <b>is there between</b> the opinions of <b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel?</b> They seem to be stating the same <i>halakha</i>. <b>Ulla said: The</b> difference <b>between them</b> involves a male <b>Ammonite</b> convert <b>and</b> a male <b>Moabite convert.</b> According to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, male Ammonite and Moabite converts disqualify a woman with whom they engage in sexual intercourse from marrying a priest, whereas Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says they do not disqualify her. <b>And both of them learned</b> their respective opinions <b>only from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a High Priest</b> who engaged in intercourse <b>with a widow,</b> although they derived the <i>halakha</i> in different ways.
How so? <b>As Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that this case is <b>like</b> that of <b>a High Priest</b> who engages in intercourse <b>with a widow: Just as</b> with regard to <b>a High Priest</b> who engages in sexual intercourse <b>with a widow,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that his offspring are unfit</b> for the priesthood, as they have the status of a <i>ḥalal</i>, <b>and he</b> similarly <b>disqualifies</b> her from marrying a priest by engaging in intercourse with her, <b>so too, anyone whose offspring is unfit</b> for the priesthood, including a male Ammonite or Moabite convert, also <b>disqualifies</b> her from marrying a priest by engaging in intercourse with her.
<b>And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> holds that the derivation is as follows: It is <b>like a High Priest</b> who engages in sexual intercourse <b>with a widow. Just as</b> with regard to <b>a High Priest</b> who engages in intercourse <b>with a widow, as all his offspring are unfit,</b> the females as well as the males, and he disqualifies her by engaging in intercourse with her, <b>so too, everyone</b> about whom the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that all his offspring are unfit, even</b> the <b>females,</b> disqualifies a woman with whom he engages in intercourse from marrying a priest. This comparison serves <b>to exclude</b> a male <b>Ammonite or Moabite convert, as</b> the <b>females</b> born to them <b>are fit to enter into the congregation. As the Master said: An Ammonite man</b> is prohibited from entering into the congregation, <b>but not an Ammonite woman;</b> similarly <b>a Moabite man</b> is prohibited from doing so, <b>but not a Moabite woman.</b>
<b>Rav Ḥisda says: All concede with regard to a widow of questionable lineage,</b> i.e., a widow whose husband was possibly a <i>ḥalal</i>, <b>that she is unfit to</b> marry into the <b>priesthood.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Who is the</b> most <b>lenient of these <i>tanna’im</i>?</b> It is <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, and he says: Anyone whose daughter you may marry, you may marry his widow; and anyone whose daughter you may not marry, you may not marry his widow</b> either. He said the latter clause <b>to exclude what?</b> It is <b>to exclude a widow of questionable lineage;</b> and it teaches <b>that she is unfit to</b> marry into <b>the priesthood,</b> since the daughter of one who was possibly a <i>ḥalal</i> is prohibited from marrying a priest.
The Gemara comments: This statement of Rav Ḥisda serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion of <b>these</b> following <b><i>tanna’im</i>. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 8:3): <b>Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira testified with regard to a widow of questionable lineage, that she is fit to</b> marry into <b>the priesthood. What is the reason</b> for this lenient ruling? <b>It is</b> a case of <b>a compound uncertainty, and</b> the principle is that in a case of <b>a compound uncertainty</b> the ruling <b>is to be lenient.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that according to Rabbi Eliezer, it is <b>permitted</b> for <b>those</b> with <b>definite</b> flaws to marry <b>with those</b> with <b>definite</b> flaws. For example, it is permitted for <i>mamzerim</i> and Gibeonites to marry each other. By contrast, it is prohibited for those with definite flaws to marry with those whose flaws result from an uncertainty, and it is also prohibited for those whose flaws result from an uncertainty to marry those whose flaws result from an uncertainty. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b> Rav Yehuda added: <b>When I said that</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>in front of Shmuel, he said to me: Hillel</b> the Elder <b>teaches</b> the mishna as stating: Jews with <b>ten</b> types of <b>lineage ascended from Babylonia, and all of them,</b> i.e., all of those who may not enter into the congregation, even those whose flaws result from an uncertainty, <b>are permitted to marry</b> into <b>each other’s</b> families; <b>and you said</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer?</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And a contradiction can be raised</b> from this statement <b>of Rav against</b> another statement <b>of Rav, and</b> similarly <b>a contradiction can be raised from</b> this statement <b>of Shmuel against</b> another statement <b>of Shmuel. As, it was stated</b> that they had the following dispute: With regard to <b>a betrothed woman who became pregnant</b> during her period of betrothal, and it is unknown whether it was her betrothed or someone else who impregnated her, <b>Rav says</b> that <b>the offspring is a <i>mamzer</i>.</b> The assumption is that she was impregnated by a different man and that the child is the offspring of a betrothed woman and a man other than her betrothed. <b>And Shmuel says</b> that <b>the offspring is a <i>shetuki</i>,</b> since there is no proof that it is a <i>mamzer</i>; she might have been impregnated by her betrothed.
The Gemara explains their respective opinions: <b>Rav says the offspring is a <i>mamzer</i> and is</b> therefore <b>permitted to</b> marry <b>a <i>mamzeret</i>; and Shmuel says the offspring is a <i>shetuki</i> and is prohibited to</b> marry <b>a <i>mamzeret</i>.</b> It is seen here that Shmuel prohibits one whose flaw results from an uncertainty from marrying one with definite <i>mamzer</i> status, whereas Rav permits such a person to marry one with definite <i>mamzer</i> status. This contradicts their earlier statements, in which Rav prohibited one whose flaw results from an uncertainty from marrying one with definite <i>mamzer</i> status and Shmuel permitted it. The Gemara answers: <b>Reverse</b> the opinions in this dispute, so that <b>Rav</b> is the one who <b>says: The offspring is a <i>shetuki</i></b> and is prohibited to marry a <i>mamzeret</i>; <b>and Shmuel says: The offspring is a <i>mamzer</i></b> and may marry a <i>mamzeret</i>.
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>why do I</b> need <b>two</b> instances of the same dispute? The Gemara answers: It is <b>necessary</b> to state the dispute twice, <b>because if it were stated</b> only <b>with regard to that</b> mishna, which discusses an unmarried woman whose offspring is a <i>shetuki</i>, one could have said: It was <b>with regard to that</b> case that <b>Rav states</b> his opinion, <b>because the majority are fit with regard to her</b> and only a minority of men are those who are forbidden to her as relatives or are those who are disqualified from entering into the congregation. <b>But there,</b> in the case of a betrothed woman who became pregnant, <b>where the majority are unfit with regard to her</b> and she is forbidden to everyone other than her betrothed, one might <b>say that</b> Rav <b>concedes to Shmuel</b> that her child is a definite <i>mamzer</i>.
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if it was stated</b> only <b>in this</b> case of a betrothed woman, one could have said it was <b>with regard to this</b> case that <b>Rav states</b> the offspring is a <i>shetuki</i>, <b>because it is</b> most reasonable <b>to ascribe</b> the pregnancy <b>to the betrothed man,</b> which would mean that the offspring is not a <i>mamzer</i>, <b>but in that</b> case of an unmarried woman, one might <b>say that he agrees with Shmuel</b> that the child is considered to be a definite <i>mamzer</i>. It is therefore <b>necessary</b> to state both cases.
<b>And if you wish, say: Actually, do not reverse</b> the opinions, <b>and what</b> is the meaning of the term <b><i>mamzer</i> that Rav is saying?</b> It does <b>not</b> signify that this offspring is <b>permitted to</b> marry <b>a <i>mamzeret</i>, but</b> merely <b>that he is prohibited from</b> marrying <b>a Jewish woman. And</b> when <b>Shmuel says the offspring is a <i>shetuki</i>,</b> he meant that he is <b>prohibited from</b> marrying <b>a Jewish woman.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so, that is</b> the same as <b>Rav. Rather, what</b> is the meaning of the term <b><i>shetuki</i></b> in Shmuel’s statement? It is <b>that one silences [<i>meshattekin</i>] him,</b> i.e., disqualifies him, <b>from the <i>halakha</i> of the priesthood.</b> In other words, even if the betrothed man was a priest, the child is not considered a priest.
The Gemara questions this: Isn’t this <b>obvious? Now,</b> if <b>one silences him from the <i>halakha</i> of a Jew</b> with unflawed lineage, and he is not allowed to enter into the congregation, <b>is it necessary</b> to say that he is silenced <b>from the <i>halakha</i> of the priesthood? Rather, what</b> is the meaning of <b><i>shetuki</i></b> in Shmuel’s statement? It is <b>that one silences him from his</b> presumed <b>father’s property,</b> i.e., he does not inherit from him. The Gemara again questions: This too <b>is obvious; do we know who his father is?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where</b> this son <b>seized</b> possession of the property of the betrothed man, claiming that the betrothed man is his father. It is with regard to such a scenario that Shmuel said that the property is taken away from him, and one does not say that the burden of proof rests upon the other inheritors to demonstrate conclusively that the betrothed man is not his father.
<b>And if you wish, say: What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>shetuki</i></b> in Shmuel’s statement? It means <b><i>beduki</i>,</b> meaning <b>that they examine his mother, and</b> if <b>she says: I engaged in sexual intercourse with</b> a man with <b>unflawed</b> lineage, <b>she is deemed credible.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this <i>halakha</i>? Is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel?</b> But <b>didn’t Shmuel</b> already <b>say</b> it <b>once? As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 13a): If an unmarried woman <b>was pregnant, and</b> people <b>said to her: What is the status of this fetus?</b> And she said to them: It is <b>from so</b>-<b>and</b>-<b>so, and he is a priest; Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Eliezer say:</b> She is <b>deemed credible; and Rabbi Yehoshua says: She is not deemed credible. And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel.</b> This shows that Shmuel had already issued an explicit ruling in Rabban Gamliel’s favor; why did he repeat himself?
The Gemara answers: It is <b>necessary</b> for Shmuel to rule twice. <b>As, if</b> he had learned it only <b>from there,</b> from the mishna discussing an unmarried pregnant woman, <b>I would say</b> he rules that way <b>there,</b> when <b>the majority are fit with regard to her,</b> as her unmarried status means that the offspring resulting from sexual intercourse with most men would be of unflawed lineage. <b>But here,</b> in the case of a betrothed woman, when <b>the majority</b> of men <b>are unfit with regard to her,</b> as she is forbidden to everyone other than her betrothed, <b>you</b> might <b>say</b> that she should <b>not</b> be deemed credible to say she engaged in intercourse with the betrothed man. It is therefore <b>necessary</b> for Shmuel to state his ruling twice.
§ <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 5:2): <b>And similarly Rabbi Elazar says: A Samaritan</b> man <b>may not marry a Samaritan woman.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> The Sages <b>established him</b> to be <b>like</b> the descendant of <b>a convert, after ten generations. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the descendant of <b>a convert,</b> he <b>is permitted to</b> marry <b>a <i>mamzeret</i></b> if he is <b>within ten generations</b> of both parents being descendants of converts; <b>from this</b> point <b>forward</b> the descendant of a convert <b>is prohibited from</b> marrying <b>a <i>mamzeret</i>,</b> as people no longer remember that he has the lineage of a convert.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And some say</b> that the descendant of a convert is permitted to marry a <i>mamzeret</i> <b>until the name of idol worship is forgotten from him,</b> i.e., as long as people remember that his roots are from gentiles he remains permitted to marry a <i>mamzeret</i>, regardless of the passage of time. Rav Yosef understands that Rabbi Elazar regards a Samaritan as being like a convert after ten generations, who may not marry a <i>mamzeret</i>. Since Samaritans assimilated among the Jewish people and are no longer recognized by the public as having Samaritan lineage, they may not marry those of flawed lineage, including, presumably, other Samaritans.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Is it comparable</b> to the case of a convert? <b>There,</b> he is <b>an old convert,</b> i.e., the conversion occurred a long time ago, <b>and she is a new <i>mamzeret</i>,</b> i.e., her status as a <i>mamzeret</i> is known. Consequently, people who see him marrying a <i>mamzeret</i> will <b>say:</b> A <b>Jewish man is marrying a <i>mamzeret</i>. Here, this and that,</b> the two Samaritans, <b>are the same as each other.</b> If people consider the Samaritan man as being assimilated among the Jewish people, and consequently he may not marry a woman of flawed lineage, the Samaritan woman should likewise be considered a Jew of unflawed lineage. <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects the previous explanation in favor of the following: <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>he said: Rabbi Elazar holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b>

Daf 75b

<b>and Rabbi Yishmael holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> concerning a different <i>halakha</i>. The Gemara clarifies: <b>Rabbi Elazar holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who says: Samaritans are lion converts,</b> i.e., they converted out of fear of being attacked by lions for worshipping idols in Eretz Yisrael. They were never converts for the sake of Heaven, but remained gentiles according to <i>halakha</i>. <b>And Rabbi Yishmael holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says:</b> In the case of <b>a gentile or</b> a Canaanite <b>slave who engaged in sexual intercourse with a Jewish woman, the offspring is a <i>mamzer</i>.</b> Since over the generations Jews assimilated with Samaritans, who have the status of gentiles, the descendants of those Jews who married Samaritans have the status of uncertain <i>mamzerim</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>But does Rabbi Yishmael hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> in this matter? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: From where</b> is it derived with regard to <b>a gentile or</b> a Canaanite <b>slave who engaged in sexual intercourse with the daughter of a priest, or</b> with <b>the daughter of a Levite, or</b> with <b>the daughter of an Israelite, that they have disqualified her</b> from marrying a priest? It is <b>as it is stated: “But if a priest’s daughter is a widow, or divorced, and has no child,</b> and is returned to her father’s house, as in her youth, she may eat of her father’s bread” (Leviticus 22:13).
He explains: It is only if she was married to <b>one who has</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>widowhood and divorce,</b> meaning a Jew, that she can return to her father’s house and partake of <i>teruma</i>. This serves to <b>exclude a gentile or</b> a Canaanite <b>slave, who do not have</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>widowhood and divorce;</b> if the daughter of a priest engages in intercourse with such a man, she may no longer partake of <i>teruma</i>.
<b>And if it enters your mind</b> that Rabbi Yishmael <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> that the offspring of a Jewish woman and a gentile or a slave is a <i>mamzer</i>, what need is there for this proof? <b>Now</b> that he holds that the offspring from a gentile <b>is a <i>mamzer</i>, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state <b>that</b> the gentile or slave <b>disqualifies</b> her from marrying a priest <b>by engaging in intercourse</b> with her?
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara explains as follows: <b>Rabbi Elazar holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who says: Samaritans are lion converts, and</b> Rabbi Elazar himself also <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says:</b> If <b>a gentile or</b> a Canaanite <b>slave engaged in sexual intercourse with a Jewish woman, the offspring is a <i>mamzer</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But does Rabbi Elazar hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva? But doesn’t Rabbi Elazar say: Although Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagreed with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>rival wives,</b> as to whether the rival wife of a <i>yevama</i> who is a forbidden relative of the <i>yavam</i> is obligated in or exempt from levirate marriage, they <b>concede that a <i>mamzer</i> is only</b> the offspring born <b>from one whose prohibition is a prohibition of forbidden relatives and punishable by <i>karet</i>.</b> Since engaging in intercourse with a gentile or a Canaanite slave is not punishable by <i>karet</i>, Rabbi Elazar would agree that the child of such a union is not a <i>mamzer</i>.
<b>Rather, when Rabin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he reported that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Abba bar Zavda</b> who <b>says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi</b> who <b>says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> There are <b>three divisions</b> of opinions <b>with regard to the matter.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yishmael holds</b> that <b>Samaritans are lion converts, and the priests who assimilated among them were unfit priests, as it is stated: “And made unto them from among themselves priests of the high places”</b> (II Kings 17:32). <b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> What is the meaning of “from among themselves”? <b>From the thorns that are among the</b> Jewish <b>people,</b> meaning those of flawed lineage. <b>And</b> it was <b>due to that</b> reason that the Sages <b>disqualified them,</b> not due to the Samaritans themselves, who are gentiles, but due to the Jews of flawed lineage who are assimilated among them. When a Samaritan seeks to marry another Samaritan, it is possible that one of them is a Jew of flawed lineage.
<b>And Rabbi Akiva holds: Samaritans are true converts, and the priests who assimilated among them were fit priests, as it is stated: “And made unto them from among themselves priests of the high places”</b> (II Kings 17:32). <b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> “From among themselves” means <b>from the chosen ones,</b> the upper echelon <b>of the</b> Jewish <b>people. And for what</b> reason <b>did</b> the Sages <b>prohibit them</b> from entering into the congregation if there is no problem with regard to their conversion or with regard to the Jews who assimilated among them? It is <b>because</b> they did not act in accordance with the <i>halakha</i>, as <b>they would perform levirate marriage with betrothed women.</b> They would perform the mitzva of levirate marriage only with one who was widowed from a betrothal,

Daf 76a

<b>and</b> they would <b>exempt married women</b> from <i>ḥalitza</i> and levirate marriage. The Gemara elaborates: In <b>what</b> way would they <b>expound</b> the verse to lead them to this conclusion? The verse states: <b>“The wife of the dead man shall not be married outside of the family to one not of his kin;</b> her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her and take her to him to be his wife, and consummate the levirate marriage” (Deuteronomy 25:5). They understood the word “outside” to be a description of the woman: <b>She who sits outside,</b> i.e., one who is only betrothed; <b>she shall not be married to one not of his kin,</b> and it is with her that the obligation of levirate marriage applies. <b>But she who is not sitting outside,</b> but who has already married, <b>shall marry one not of his kin.</b> Consequently, the concern with regard to the Samaritans is that their descendants include the children of a widow who unlawfully wed one who was not her brother-in-law.
After having explained which prohibition the Samaritans violated, the Gemara explains how this accounts for the prohibition with regard to marriage with Samaritans. <b>And Rabbi Akiva</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he says:</b> The offspring of intercourse <b>for which</b> one <b>is liable</b> for violating <b>a prohibition is a <i>mamzer</i>.</b> Therefore, the descendants of a <i>yevama</i> who had transgressed the prohibition of: “The wife of the deceased shall not be married outside of the family to one not of his kin,” have the status of <i>mamzerim</i>.
<b>And some say</b> a third opinion as to why the Sages disqualified Samaritans for marriage: It is <b>because they are not well versed in the details of mitzvot.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the one indicated by the phrase: <b>Some say? Rav Idi bar Avin said: It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Pesaḥim</i> 2:2): <b>The <i>matza</i> of a Samaritan is permitted</b> to be eaten on Passover and is not considered to be leavened bread, <b>and a person can fulfill his obligation</b> to eat <i>matza</i> on the first night <b>of Passover with it; but Rabbi Eliezer prohibits</b> it, <b>since</b> Samaritans <b>are not well versed in the details of mitzvot,</b> and there is concern that their <i>matza</i> might be leavened. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says</b> that this is not a concern, as with regard to <b>any mitzva that Samaritans embraced</b> and accepted, <b>they are more exacting in its</b> observance <b>than</b> are <b>Jews.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But here,</b> with regard to marriage, in <b>what</b> details are <b>they not well versed?</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>because they are not well versed with regard to the laws of betrothal and divorce.</b> Consequently, it is possible that their bills of divorce were invalid, or that a betrothed woman was allowed to remarry without having received a bill of divorce, which would mean that her future children would be <i>mamzerim</i>.
<b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> Samaritans are of flawed lineage because <b>a <i>mamzer</i></b> resulting <b>from</b> intercourse between a man and <b>his sister and a <i>mamzer</i></b> resulting <b>from</b> intercourse between a man and his <b>brother’s wife were assimilated among them,</b> and they therefore all have the status of <i>mamzerim</i> due to the uncertainty as to the identity of those assimilated <i>mamzerim</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>What is he teaching us</b> by providing the details of how they are <i>mamzerim</i> due to uncertainty? If he intended to incidentally teach us the <i>halakha</i> that the offspring from intercourse <b>for which</b> one <b>is liable to receive <i>karet</i> is a <i>mamzer</i>, let him teach one</b> example, by mentioning the example of a <i>mamzer</i> from a sister. The Gemara answers: He did not mention these details to teach us a <i>halakha</i>, but rather <b>the incident that took place, took place in this way,</b> and that is why the Samaritans were considered to be of flawed lineage.
<b>And Rava says:</b> A Canaanite <b>slave and</b> a Canaanite <b>maidservant were assimilated among them.</b> The Gemara asks: In these cases, <b>the prohibition</b> is <b>due to what?</b> It is <b>due to</b> a Canaanite <b>maidservant,</b> whose children are slaves. But if so, <b>let him teach one</b> example; why also mention a Canaanite slave, whose child resulting from intercourse with a Jewish woman is of unflawed lineage? The Gemara again answers: <b>The incident that took place, took place in this way.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A priest <b>who marries a woman</b> who is <b>the daughter of a priest must investigate with regard to her</b> background, i.e., he must check previous generations of her family tree from both the maternal and paternal sides, for <b>four mothers, which are eight.</b> How so? He investigates the lineage of <b>her mother, and the mother of her mother, and the mother of her mother’s father, and her mother,</b> i.e., the mother of her mother’s fathers’ mother. <b>And</b> he also investigates the lineage of <b>the mother of her father, and her mother,</b> i.e., the mother of her father’s mother, <b>and the mother of her father’s father, and her mother</b> i.e., the mother of her father’s father’s mother. If he seeks to marry <b>a Levite</b> woman <b>or an Israelite</b> woman, <b>he adds to these</b> an investigation of mothers of <b>one additional</b> generation.
With regard to these investigations, <b>one need not investigate from the altar and above.</b> If his ancestors included a priest who served at the altar, one checks no further, as the court would have investigated his lineage before allowing him to participate in the Temple service. <b>Nor</b> do they check <b>from the platform,</b> used by Levites for singing in the Temple, <b>and above, nor from the Sanhedrin and above,</b> since only one whose lineage has been examined and who was found to be fit can be appointed to the Sanhedrin. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>anyone whose ancestors held public posts, and</b> anyone whose ancestors were <b>charity collectors, may marry into the priesthood, and there is no need to investigate their</b> lineage, since no one of flawed lineage would be appointed to those positions.
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: Even</b> the descendants of <b>one who had signed</b> as <b>a witness in the old court [<i>ba’arki</i>] of Tzippori</b> do not need to have their lineage investigated. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says: Even</b> the descendants of <b>one who was written</b> in <b>the army list [<i>be’isteratya</i>] of the</b> Jewish <b>king</b> do not need to have their lineage investigated.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is different about women</b> that <b>we investigate</b> their lineage, <b>and what is different about men</b> that <b>we do not investigate</b> their lineage? Why shouldn’t we also examine the lineage of a bride’s male ancestors for any possible flaw, as we do her female ancestors? The Gemara answers: <b>When women quarrel with each other, it is through</b> accusations of engaging in <b>forbidden sexual intercourse,</b> i.e., licentiousness, <b>that they quarrel. And if it is so that there is a matter</b> of a flaw with regard to the lineage of the woman in question, <b>it</b> would <b>not</b> generate <b>publicity.</b> By contrast, <b>when men quarrel with each other, it is through</b> accusations of flawed <b>lineage that they quarrel.</b> Therefore, <b>if it is so that there is a matter</b> of a flaw with regard to her father’s lineage, <b>it</b> would generate <b>publicity,</b> even if no investigation is conducted.
The Gemara inquires: <b>But she should also investigate his</b> lineage; why is only the lineage of the woman investigated? The Gemara comments: This <b>supports Rav, as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> It was <b>not prohibited</b> for <b>women</b> of <b>unflawed</b> lineage, i.e., daughters of priests, <b>to marry</b> men of <b>flawed</b> lineage, such as <i>ḥalalim</i>, converts, or emancipated slaves. Therefore, women are not required to investigate the lineage of potential husbands.
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava taught</b> that one needs to investigate <b>four mothers who are twelve,</b> adding an additional two generations of mothers of each of the woman’s parents. <b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: Four mothers who are sixteen.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to Rav Adda bar Ahava,</b>

Daf 76b

<b>he interprets</b> his statement as referring <b>to a Levite</b> woman <b>or an Israelite woman,</b> about whom the mishna states that one must investigate one additional generation. Therefore, Rav Adda bar Ahava’s ruling accords with that of the mishna. <b>But</b> shall <b>we say the <i>baraita</i> disputes</b> the mishna? The Gemara rejects this: <b>No, what is</b> the meaning of the mishna’s phrase: <b>One additional?</b> It means <b>one pair,</b> i.e., two more mothers on each side.
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: This</b> mishna presents <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir, but the Rabbis say: All families retain a presumptive status of fitness,</b> and do not require investigation. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so,</b> did Rav really say this? <b>But doesn’t Rav Ḥama bar Gurya say</b> that <b>Rav says: Our mishna</b> is referring only to a case <b>when an objection was registered about</b> the family concerning its lineage, but if no objection was registered, everyone agrees that the family retains its presumptive status of fitness. The Gemara answers: <b>The one who taught this</b> statement in the name of Rav <b>did not teach that</b> other statement.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that this discussion occurred as follows: <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: This</b> mishna presents <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir, but the Rabbis say: All families retain presumptive status of fitness. Rav Ḥama bar Gurya says</b> that <b>Rav says: When an objection is registered about</b> a family concerning its lineage, everyone agrees that <b>he must investigate it.</b> According to this version, there is no contradiction between these two complementary statements.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>one need not investigate from the altar and above.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> the Sanhedrin <b>had not examined his</b> lineage <b>they would not have</b> allowed <b>him to ascend</b> to the altar and perform the sacrificial rites. The mishna further teaches: <b>Nor</b> must one investigate <b>from the platform and above.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason?</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the Master said</b> in his description of the Temple chambers (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ḥagiga</i> 2:4): <b>For there</b> in the Hewn Chamber those of the <b>priesthood</b> with unflawed <b>lineage and the Levites of</b> unflawed <b>lineage sat</b> and examined the lineage of everyone who came to serve in the Temple.
The mishna also taught: <b>Nor</b> must one investigate <b>from the Sanhedrin and above. What is the reason</b> there is no need to investigate further? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as Rav Yosef taught</b> that <b>just as the court is clean in justice, so too, it is clean of any blemish,</b> i.e., it does not include anyone of flawed lineage. <b>Mareimar said: What is the verse</b> from which it is derived? It states: <b>“You are all fair, my love; and there is no blemish in you”</b> (Song of Songs 4:7).
The Gemara asks: But perhaps you should <b>say</b> that this is referring to <b>an actual blemish,</b> that one who has a physical blemish may not be appointed to the Sanhedrin. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> It is not necessary to derive the <i>halakha</i> that one who has a physical blemish may not be appointed to the Sanhedrin from this verse, as <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the transfer of the Divine Spirit from Moses to the Elders: <b>“That they may stand there with you”</b> (Numbers 11:16), and the phrase <b>“with you”</b> is explained to mean: <b>With similarity to you,</b> teaching that the members of the Sanhedrin must be whole in body like Moses.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>But perhaps</b> those who were with Moses had to be free of any blemish <b>due to</b> the <b>Divine Presence,</b> which rested upon them, but this is not a requirement for judges on the Sanhedrin. <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>the verse states: “So shall they make it easier for you and bear the burden with you”</b> (Exodus 18:22). The phrase “with you” is explained to mean: <b>With similarity to you,</b> i.e., without blemish. This verse is referring to the appointment of regular judges, upon whom the Divine Presence does not rest, and teaches that all members of the Sanhedrin must be whole in body. The verse from Song of Songs teaches that they must be of unflawed lineage as well.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Anyone whose ancestors held public posts</b> may marry into the priesthood without investigation. The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that we do not establish</b> officers and other public appointees <b>from</b> people with <b>flawed</b> lineage? <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from the following statement: <b>All are fit to judge</b> cases of <b>monetary law, but not all are fit to judge</b> cases of <b>capital law. And we discussed it: What does</b> the word: <b>All,</b> serve <b>to include? And Rav Yehuda says:</b> It serves <b>to include a <i>mamzer</i>,</b> that he may judge cases of monetary law. This indicates that even a <i>mamzer</i> may occupy a public position. <b>Abaye said:</b> The mishna is referring to public officials <b>in Jerusalem,</b> where they were particular that all their judges should be of unflawed lineage. <b>And Rav Shimon bar Zeira similarly taught in</b> the <i>baraita</i> of <b><i>Kiddushin</i> from</b> the <b>school of Levi:</b> It is referring to public officials <b>in Jerusalem.</b>
The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> anyone whose ancestors were <b>charity collectors may marry</b> into the priesthood without investigation. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara answers: It is <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>they quarrel with people,</b> as <b>the Master said:</b> Those appointed to collect charity <b>may</b> forcibly <b>take collateral for charity</b> from those who have not fulfilled their obligations <b>even on the eve of Shabbat,</b> when people are preoccupied and rushed, leading to quarrels. <b>And if it is so that there is</b> a flaw in the lineage of the collector’s family, <b>it</b> would generate <b>publicity</b> through the quarrels that are an unavoidable aspect of his job.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava’s host was</b> the son of <b>a convert, and he and Rav Beivai were quarreling. One said: I</b> will <b>perform the service of the city,</b> i.e., I will be appointed to a position of authority, <b>and one said: I</b> will <b>perform the service of the city. They came before Rav Yosef</b> to decide between them. Rav Yosef <b>said to them: We learned: “You shall set him king over you,</b> whom the Lord your God shall choose; <b>one from among your brothers”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:15). The repetition of the verb “set” in the verse [<i>som tasim</i>] indicates: <b>All appointments that you appoint may be only from among your brothers.</b> Therefore, a convert may not serve in any official position.
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>And</b> does this <i>halakha</i> apply <b>even</b> if the <b>mother</b> of the person in question is born <b>Jewish?</b> In other words, does this apply to one whose father is a convert? Rav Yosef <b>said to him:</b> If <b>his mother is</b> born <b>Jewish,</b> the words: <b>“From among your brothers” are said about him. Therefore,</b> now that it has been determined that this person’s mother was born Jewish and that he is fit to serve a public role, <b>Rav Beivai, who is a great man</b> in Torah learning, <b>should oversee the matters of Heaven,</b> i.e., the public issues that involve the performance of mitzvot; <b>and the Master,</b> Rav Adda bar Ahava’s host, <b>should oversee the</b> other <b>matters of the city. Abaye said,</b> as a moral of the story: <b>Therefore,</b> if <b>one has a Torah scholar as a guest, let him host</b> a person <b>such as Rav Adda bar Ahava, who knows how to plead in his favor,</b> as it was the argument of Rav Adda bar Ahava that led to his host’s appointment.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Zeira would deal with</b> converts and assign them to positions of authority. Similarly, <b>Rabba bar Avuh would deal with them. In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they would not establish even an appointee over measurements from them,</b> as they extended the prohibition against appointing a convert as a king to include all positions of power. <b>In Neharde’a, they would not establish even an appointee over irrigation</b> of the city fields <b>from them.</b>
The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Even</b> the descendants of <b>one who</b> had signed as a witness in the Old Court of Tzippori does not need to have their lineage investigated. The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara answers: In that city, they would first <b>examine</b> witnesses and only afterward <b>have them sign.</b> Consequently, anyone who signed as a witness in Tzippori must certainly have been of unflawed lineage.
The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus</b> says: Even the descendants of one who was written in the army list of the Jewish king does not have their lineage investigated. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The reference is to one who was written <b>in</b> the list of <b>the military troops of the House of David,</b> who were all of pure lineage. <b>Rav Yosef said: What is the verse</b> from which it is derived? The phrase is: <b>“Reckoned by lineage for service in war”</b> (I Chronicles 7:40). The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> for this requirement that they be of unflawed lineage? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> It is <b>in order that their merit and the merit of their ancestors will help them</b> in battle.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there Zelek the Ammonite,</b> one of David’s warriors (II Samuel 23:37); <b>what, is it not</b> indicated <b>that</b> he was a convert who <b>came from Ammon?</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> his name indicates only <b>that he dwelled in Ammon,</b> but he was born a Jew. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there Uriah the Hittite</b> (II Samuel 23:39); <b>what, is it not</b> indicated <b>that</b> he <b>came from Heth?</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> his name indicates only <b>that he dwelled in Heth.</b>
The Gemara further asks: <b>But isn’t there Ittai the Gittite</b> (II Samuel 15:19)? <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>so too</b> his name indicates <b>that he dwelled in Gath</b> but was born a Jew, <b>but doesn’t Rav Naḥman say,</b> to explain how David could make use of the crown of the idol of Ammon in apparent violation of the prohibition against deriving benefit from idolatry: <b>Ittai the Gittite came and nullified its</b> status of an idol. The <i>halakha</i> is that only a gentile can nullify an idol, by doing something degrading to it. This indicates that Ittai the Gittite must have been a gentile.
The Gemara again questions the statement that all of the soldiers in David’s army were of unflawed lineage. <b>And further, Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: David had four hundred youths</b> in his camp, <b>all sons of beautiful women,</b> i.e., born to women captured in war, who were therefore gentiles, <b>all of</b> whom <b>had their hair cut</b> in the <b><i>komei</i></b> style <b>or</b> who <b>grew</b> their hair in <b>a gentile hairstyle [<i>belorit</i>]</b> on the back of their heads, <b>and all of them sat in gold carts [<i>bikroniyyot</i>] and would march at the head of troops</b> in David’s army; <b>and these very ones were the strong men of the House of David,</b> i.e., David would rely on their strength. This states that David’s army included men of flawed lineage. The Gemara answers: These four hundred youths did not fight in the battles, but rather <b>they would go forth</b> in front of the troops <b>in order to frighten everyone.</b>

Daf 77a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The daughter of a male <i>ḥalal</i> is unfit to</b> marry into <b>the priesthood forever.</b> In other words, all daughters of male descendants of a <i>ḥalal</i> are prohibited from marrying priests, as they have the status of <i>ḥalalot</i>. If there was <b>an Israelite who married a <i>ḥalala</i>, his daughter is fit to</b> marry into <b>the priesthood,</b> whereas if there was <b>a <i>ḥalal</i> who married a Jewish woman, his daughter is unfit to</b> marry into <b>the priesthood. Rabbi Yehuda says: The daughter of a male convert is like the daughter of a male <i>ḥalal</i>,</b> and she is also prohibited from marrying into the priesthood.
<b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov</b> disagrees and <b>says:</b> If there was <b>an Israelite who married a</b> female <b>convert, his daughter is fit to</b> marry into <b>the priesthood, and</b> similarly if there was <b>a convert who married a Jewish woman, his daughter is fit to</b> marry into <b>the priesthood. But</b> if there was a male <b>convert who married</b> a female <b>convert, his daughter is unfit to</b> marry into <b>the priesthood.</b> With regard to <b>both converts and emancipated</b> Canaanite <b>slaves,</b> their daughters are unfit to marry into the priesthood <b>even up to ten generations.</b> This <i>halakha</i> applies to the offspring <b>until his mother is</b> born <b>Jewish. Rabbi Yosei says: Even</b> if there was a male <b>convert who married</b> a female <b>convert, his daughter is fit to</b> marry into <b>the priesthood.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What</b> is the meaning of the statement that the daughter of a <i>ḥalal</i> is unfit <b>forever?</b> The Gemara explains: It is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> should be <b>just as it is in</b> the case of <b>an Egyptian</b> convert <b>and an Edomite</b> convert, and that <b>just as there,</b> with regard to an Egyptian and an Edomite, their descendants are permitted to enter into the congregation <b>after three generations, so too here,</b> the daughter of a descendant of a <i>ḥalal</i> should <b>also</b> be allowed to marry into the priesthood <b>after three generations.</b> The mishna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this prohibition is permanent.
The mishna teaches that in the case of <b>an Israelite who married a <i>ḥalala</i>,</b> his daughter is fit to marry into the priesthood. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon</b> that <b>it is stated here: “And he shall not profane his offspring among his people”</b> (Leviticus 21:15), <b>and it is stated there: “He shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people”</b> (Leviticus 21:4): <b>Just as there</b> the prohibition against a priest contracting ritual impurity from a corpse applies to <b>males but not females; so too here,</b> with regard to the profanation of his offspring, where the term “among his people” is also employed, it is <b>males</b> who are rendered unfit and who render their daughters unfit to marry into the priesthood when they are <i>ḥalalim</i>, <b>but not females.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that profanation applies only to males, <b>the daughter of a High Priest</b> and a widow <b>should be permitted</b> to marry into the priesthood, and there should be no status of a <i>ḥalala</i>. The Gemara rejects this: <b>Is it written</b> that <b>his son</b> is profaned? <b>It is written: “His offspring,”</b> which includes his daughter, as the verse reads: <b>“He shall not profane his offspring among his people.”</b> Nevertheless, the daughter of his <i>ḥalala</i> daughter, who is already the third generation, is permitted as a result of the verbal analogy.
The Gemara asks: If so, that the granddaughter is permitted as a result of the verbal analogy, <b>the daughter of his son should</b> also <b>be permitted.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is written: “He shall not profane his offspring,”</b> by which the Torah <b>links his offspring to him: Just as</b> for <b>him, his daughter is unfit; so too</b> for <b>his son,</b> the son of a High Priest, <b>his daughter is unfit.</b> The Gemara asks: In that case, <b>the daughter of his daughter</b> from an Israelite <b>should be prohibited,</b> just as his own daughter is unfit. The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> that his daughter’s daughter is also unfit, <b>of what use is the verbal analogy</b> of: “He shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people”? It must teach that his daughter’s daughter is fit.
§ The mishna teaches that if there was <b>a <i>ḥalal</i> who married a Jewish woman, his daughter is unfit</b> to marry into the priesthood. The Gemara questions this ruling: <b>Wasn’t this</b> already <b>taught in the first clause: The daughter of a male <i>ḥalal</i> is unfit to</b> marry into <b>the priesthood forever?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since it taught</b> in <b>the first clause</b> about <b>an Israelite who married a <i>ḥalala</i>, it also taught</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> about <b>a <i>ḥalal</i> who married a Jewish woman,</b> to present the complete ruling.
The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dostai ben Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Dostai ben Yehuda says: Just as the sons of Israel</b> are <b>a ritual bath of purity for <i>ḥalalot</i>,</b> i.e., the daughter of a <i>ḥalala</i> who marries an Israelite does not transmit her status of a <i>ḥalala</i>, and their daughters may marry priests, <b>so the daughters of Israel are a ritual bath of purity for <i>ḥalalim</i>,</b> and their daughters may marry priests. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Dostai, son of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> The Gemara explains that <b>the verse states: “He shall not profane his offspring among his people”</b> (Leviticus 21:15), which teaches: <b>It is among one people that he profanes,</b> i.e., the offspring is a <i>ḥalal</i> only when he and his wife are both profaned, i.e., <i>ḥalalim</i>, but <b>among two peoples he does not profane.</b> If the mother is of a different people, i.e., not a <i>ḥalala</i>, the offspring is of unflawed lineage.
<b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states that a priest may not engage in intercourse with a woman who is forbidden to him, so that <b>“he shall not profane his offspring.” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>his offspring</b> resulting from a union with a woman forbidden to him is profaned, i.e., has the status of a <i>ḥalal</i>; <b>from where</b> do I derive that <b>she herself, i.e.,</b> the woman who engaged in forbidden intercourse with the priest, is also disqualified from marrying into the priesthood? <b>You</b> can <b>say</b> it is an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If his offspring, who did not commit a transgression, is profaned, is it not logical that she, who did commit a transgression, is</b> similarly <b>profaned?</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>He,</b> the priest <b>himself, shall prove</b> otherwise, <b>as he committed a transgression but</b> he is <b>not profaned.</b> Although he may not serve in the Temple while he remains married to her, he regains his status of a fit priest once he divorces her. The Gemara rejects this: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about</b> the priest? He is notable <b>in that</b> he is a male, <b>and in no case is</b> a male priest <b>profaned</b> by engaging in forbidden intercourse. Will <b>you say</b> the same <b>with regard to her,</b> a woman, <b>who is disqualified</b> from marrying a priest <b>in all cases?</b> For example, if she engages in intercourse with a man of flawed lineage, she assumes the status of a <i>zona</i> and is permanently disqualified from marrying into the priesthood.
<b>And if it is your wish to say</b> that this reasoning is faulty, there is a different proof: <b>The verse states: “He shall not profane his offspring,”</b> which means that the priest may not engage in intercourse with a woman who is forbidden to him so that someone <b>shall not become profaned.</b> The verse is referring to <b>this</b> woman <b>who was</b> at one time <b>fit and</b> then <b>became profaned.</b> In other words, the term profanation does not apply to his offspring, as they were never fit to begin with. Rather, it is referring to the woman with whom he engaged in intercourse, as, since she was initially fit to marry into the priesthood, she can be described as becoming profaned.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>If it is your wish to say</b> that this reasoning is faulty, in what way is it faulty? The Gemara explains the counterargument: <b>And if you would say</b> that the <i>a fortiori</i> argument <b>can be refuted</b> as follows: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about his offspring?</b> He is notable <b>in that he is formed through a transgression.</b> Since the woman was not formed through a transgression, one cannot derive the <i>halakha</i> pertaining to her from that of the offspring. The Gemara therefore continues that even if one were to state that counterargument, <b>the verse</b> nevertheless <b>states: “He shall not profane his offspring,”</b> which means that the priest may not engage in intercourse with a woman who is forbidden to him so that someone <b>shall not become profaned.</b> The verse is referring to <b>this</b> woman <b>who was</b> at one time <b>fit and</b> then <b>became profaned.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught: Who is a <i>ḥalala</i>?</b> The term is referring to <b>any</b> woman <b>born from</b> people of <b>flawed</b> lineage. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of people of <b>flawed</b> lineage? <b>If we say</b> it means she was born from someone <b>unfit for him,</b> i.e., a woman forbidden to this particular man due to a family relationship or for some other reason, <b>isn’t there</b> the case of one who <b>remarries his divorcée</b> after she had been married to someone else in the interim; she is <b>unfit for him, and</b> yet <b>her children are fit. As it is written</b> with regard to this case: <b>“That is an abomination”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:4), and this is interpreted to mean: <b>That</b> marriage <b>is an abomination, but the children of</b> that marriage <b>are not an abomination</b> and are entirely fit.
<b>Rav Yehuda says: This is</b> what the Sages are <b>saying: Who is a <i>ḥalala</i>?</b> The term is referring to <b>any</b> woman <b>born from one unfit for the priesthood.</b> The Gemara questions this: This implies that one who was <b>born, yes,</b> she is a <i>ḥalala</i>, but one who was <b>not born</b> from one unfit for the priesthood is <b>not</b> a <i>ḥalala</i>. <b>Aren’t there</b> the cases of <b>a widow, or a divorced woman,</b> or <b>a <i>zona</i></b> who engaged in intercourse with a priest? They were <b>not born</b> from one who was unfit for the priesthood, <b>and</b> yet such a woman <b>is a <i>ḥalala</i>.</b>
<b>Rabba said: This is</b> what the Sages are <b>saying: Who is the <i>ḥalala</i> mentioned that did not have a moment of fitness at all,</b> but was unfit from birth? She is <b>any</b> woman <b>born from one unfit for the priesthood.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the term: <b>Mentioned?</b> Where was she mentioned? <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Avin said: This is</b> what the Sages are <b>saying: Who is the <i>ḥalala</i> whose</b> prohibition <b>is rooted in the words of</b> a verse in <b>the Torah, and it is not necessary to clarify</b> her prohibition further <b>by the words of the Sages?</b> She is <b>any</b> woman <b>born from one unfit for the priesthood.</b> With regard to such a woman the verse explicitly states: “He shall not profane his offspring.” By contrast, the <i>halakha</i> that a woman who engages in forbidden intercourse with a priest becomes a <i>ḥalala</i> is not explicit in the Torah, but is learned through an exposition of the Sages.
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> If a High Priest engages in sexual intercourse with <b>a widow, a widow, a widow, he is liable</b> to receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes. Similarly, if a priest engages in intercourse with <b>a divorcée, a divorcée, a divorcée, he is liable</b> to receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes.
If a High Priest engages in sexual intercourse with a woman who was <b>a widow, and</b> then was <b>a divorcée, and</b> then was <b>a <i>ḥalala</i>,</b> and then was <b>a <i>zona</i>, when</b> the changes to her status occurred <b>in</b> that <b>order,</b> that she was first widowed, then remarried and was divorced, and subsequently engaged in intercourse with a priest, thereby becoming a <i>ḥalala</i>, and then she engaged in intercourse with a gentile or a forbidden relative, thereby becoming a <i>zona</i>, the High Priest <b>is liable</b> to receive lashes <b>for each and every one</b> of these transgressions each time he engages in intercourse with her. By contrast, if she first <b>became a <i>zona</i></b> by engaging in intercourse with a gentile or a forbidden relative, <b>and</b> then <b>became a <i>ḥalala</i></b> by engaging in intercourse with a priest, <b>and</b> subsequently <b>she divorced,</b> remarried, <b>and was widowed,</b> a High Priest who now engages in intercourse with her <b>is liable</b> to receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes.
The Gemara proceeds to clarify this <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: If a High Priest engages in intercourse with <b>a widow, a widow, a widow, he is liable</b> to receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances of this widow? If we say that he engaged in sexual intercourse</b> with three widows: <b>With Reuven’s widow, and with Shimon’s widow, and with Levi’s widow, why is he liable</b> to receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes?

Daf 77b

<b>Aren’t they separate bodies,</b> i.e., three different people? <b>Aren’t they labels [<i>shemot</i>]</b> of <b>separate [<i>muḥlakim</i>]</b> prohibitions, since each one is forbidden in her own right? It is therefore clear that he should receive lashes for each act.
<b>Rather,</b> perhaps it means <b>that he engaged in three acts of intercourse with one widow.</b> The Gemara analyzes this possibility: <b>What are the circumstances? If they did not forewarn him</b> between each act, it <b>is obvious</b> that <b>he is liable</b> to receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes, for one must be forewarned in order to be liable to receive lashes, and here he was forewarned only once for the three acts. There would be no need to state this <i>halakha</i>.
<b>Rather,</b> perhaps the case is <b>that they forewarned him for each and every one</b> of his acts of intercourse. But if that were the case, <b>why is he liable</b> to receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Nazir</i> 42a): <b>A nazirite who was drinking wine</b> in violation of his naziriteship <b>the entire day is liable</b> to receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes. If <b>they said to him: Do not drink, do not drink,</b> i.e., he was forewarned several times, <b>and he</b> nevertheless <b>drinks, he is liable</b> to receive lashes <b>for each and every</b> time he was forewarned and proceeded to drink.
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for a case <b>where he engaged in sexual intercourse</b> one time <b>with Reuven’s widow, who was</b> previously <b>Shimon’s widow, who was</b> previously <b>Levi’s widow. Lest you say</b> they are <b>separate labels</b> of prohibitions and he should be liable to receive three sets of lashes, since she was widowed from three different people, the <i>baraita</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that <b>we require separate bodies</b> for him to receive separate punishments, <b>and</b> as that is <b>not</b> the case here, he is liable to receive only one set of lashes.
The <i>baraita</i> teaches that if a High Priest engages in sexual intercourse with a woman who was <b>a widow, and</b> then was <b>a divorcée, and</b> then was <b>a <i>ḥalala</i>,</b> and then was <b>a <i>zona</i>,</b> if the changes to her status occurred in that order he is liable to receive lashes for each of them. The Gemara asks: <b>What does this <i>tanna</i> hold? If he holds</b> that <b>a prohibition takes effect</b> where another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, i.e., if an item or a person is rendered forbidden by a prohibition then another prohibition can take effect in addition to the first one, <b>the reverse</b> should <b>also</b> be the case, i.e., if she was initially a <i>zona</i> and subsequently became a <i>ḥalala</i>, the same two prohibitions should apply to her. <b>And if he holds</b> that <b>a prohibition does not take effect</b> where another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, he should <b>likewise not</b> be liable to receive more than one set of lashes <b>even</b> if they occurred <b>in this order.</b>
<b>Rava said:</b> In general, <b>this <i>tanna</i> does not</b> accept the principle that <b>a prohibition takes effect</b> where <b>another prohibition</b> already exists, but <b>he holds</b> that it does take effect in the case of <b>an expanded prohibition.</b> If the second prohibition adds people to the category of those to whom the item is forbidden, then it takes effect in addition to the previous prohibition, which had a more limited range.
In this case, <b>a widow is forbidden to a High Priest but is permitted to a common priest.</b> Once <b>she becomes a divorcée, since a prohibition has been added to her with regard to a common priest,</b> as a common priest is prohibited from marrying a divorcée, the <b>prohibition is</b> also <b>added to her with regard to a High Priest. And</b> at this stage, <b>she is still permitted to partake of <i>teruma</i></b> if she is the daughter of a priest. When <b>she becomes a <i>ḥalala</i></b> by engaging in sexual intercourse with a priest, <b>since a prohibition</b> for her <b>to eat <i>teruma</i> has been added,</b> the <b>prohibition</b> with regard to a <i>ḥalala</i> <b>is</b> also <b>added with regard to a High Priest</b> who engages in intercourse with her, in addition to the prohibitions of a widow and a divorcée. It is only if they occurred in this order that each prohibition adds to the previous one, but not if they happened in the reverse order.
Yet, one could ask: <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a <i>zona</i>, what expanded prohibition is there with regard to her?</b> There is no additional prohibition with a <i>zona</i> beyond what is prohibited with regard to a <i>ḥalala</i>. <b>Rav Ḥana bar Rav Ketina said: Since the label of <i>zenut</i> disqualifies</b> her <b>in Israel,</b> it is viewed as an expanded prohibition. Although a <i>zona</i> as precisely defined in this context, i.e., a woman who engages in sexual intercourse with one who is unfit for her, is prohibited only to priests and does not add any prohibition beyond that of a <i>ḥalala</i>, the label of a <i>zona</i> in its broader sense, such as a married woman who commits adultery, does disqualify her to an Israelite, namely her husband. Therefore, there is a prohibition with regard to a <i>zona</i> that has a greater scope than the prohibition with regard to a <i>ḥalala</i>.
<b>A <i>tanna</i> taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Sheshet:</b> The command addressed to the High Priest states: “A widow, or one divorced, or a <i>ḥalala</i>, or a <i>zona</i>, these shall he not take; but a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife” (Leviticus 21:14). <b>Any</b> woman <b>who is</b> included <b>in</b> the mitzva: <b>“Shall he take” is</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition: <b>“Shall he not take”</b> if she becomes a widow or a divorcée. And <b>any</b> woman <b>who is not</b> included <b>in</b> the mitzva: <b>“Shall he take” is not</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition: <b>“Shall he not take.”</b> This <b>excludes</b> the case <b>of a High Priest who engaged in intercourse with his widowed sister.</b> As his sister, she is forbidden to him even when she is a virgin, so the mitzva: “Shall he take” does not refer to her. Therefore, he does not transgress the prohibition: “Shall he not take” if he engages in intercourse with her after she had been widowed or divorced.
Rav Sheshet <b>said to him:</b> He <b>who said</b> this <b>to you,</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion did he teach it? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> as a principle: <b>A prohibition does not take effect</b> where another <b>prohibition</b> already exists. Therefore, his sister, who was already forbidden to him by virtue of being his sister, is not forbidden due to the additional prohibition: “Shall he not take.” <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: One who eats</b> an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass on Yom Kippur is exempt</b> from <i>karet</i> for eating on the fast day, since the prohibition against eating an animal carcass applied to it beforehand. <b>As, if</b> you say this <i>baraita</i> follows the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, don’t they say: A prohibition takes effect where another prohibition</b> already <b>exists?</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>You</b> can <b>even say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, as when the Rabbis say</b> that <b>a prohibition takes effect where another prohibition</b> already <b>exists, that statement</b> applies only when the second prohibition is a more <b>severe prohibition,</b> e.g., eating on Yom Kippur, which takes effect in addition <b>to a light prohibition,</b> in this case, eating an unslaughtered animal carcass. <b>But a light prohibition does not take effect</b> in addition <b>to a severe prohibition.</b> In this case, the prohibition of engaging in intercourse with one’s sister, which is punishable by <i>karet</i>, is more severe than that of: “A widow or one divorced, or a <i>ḥalala</i>, or a <i>zona</i>, these shall he not take,” which is punishable by flogging.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Rav Sheshet said to the <i>tanna</i> as follows: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this? It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say: A prohibition takes effect where another prohibition</b> already <b>exists. And when the Rabbis say</b> that <b>a prohibition takes effect where another prohibition</b> already <b>exists, that statement</b> applies when the second prohibition is a more <b>severe prohibition,</b> which takes effect in addition <b>to a light prohibition, but a light prohibition does not take effect</b> in addition <b>to a severe prohibition. As, if</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, now</b> that he holds that even <b>a severe prohibition does not take effect</b> in addition <b>to a light prohibition, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to say that <b>a light prohibition does not take effect</b> in addition <b>to a severe prohibition?</b> There would be no novelty in this ruling of the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara rejects this: It is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>a prohibition</b> involving the <b>priesthood is different.</b> You might say that since there are many stringencies that apply only to priests, then with regard to prohibitions of the priesthood, a second prohibition should take effect in addition to a first one. He therefore <b>teaches us</b> that Rabbi Shimon holds that the second prohibition does not take effect even when it is one addressed to members of the priesthood.
§ <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye:</b> In the case of <b>an Israelite who engages in intercourse with his sister,</b> this <b>makes her a <i>zona</i></b> and she is forbidden to a priest. But does <b>he</b> also <b>make her a <i>ḥalala</i></b> so that a priest who engages in intercourse with her is also liable for violating the prohibition of engaging in intercourse with a <i>ḥalala</i>, <b>or</b> perhaps <b>he does not make her</b> a <i>ḥalala</i>?
The two sides of the question are as follows: <b>Do we say</b> that this is <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: If <b>she becomes a <i>ḥalala</i> by</b> engaging in sexual intercourse for which she <b>is liable</b> for violating only an ordinary <b>prohibition,</b> should she <b>not all the more so</b> be considered a <i>ḥalala</i> <b>by</b> engaging in intercourse for which she <b>is liable</b> to be punished by <b><i>karet</i>? Or perhaps</b> the status of <b><i>ḥalala</i></b> results <b>only</b> from <b>a prohibition</b> addressed specifically to the <b>priesthood?</b> Abaye <b>said to him:</b> A prohibition with regard to <b>a <i>ḥalala</i></b> results <b>only</b> from <b>a prohibition</b> addressed specifically to the <b>priesthood</b> and from that <b>alone.</b>
<b>Rava says: From where is this matter that the Sages state,</b> that <b>a <i>ḥalala</i></b> results <b>only</b> from <b>a prohibition</b> addressed specifically to the <b>priesthood,</b> derived? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse need <b>not</b> explicitly <b>state</b> that <b>a divorcée</b> is forbidden <b>to a High Priest, and</b> one could <b>derive it by</b> means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a common priest. As I</b> can <b>state</b> the following argument: <b>Now</b> that a divorcée <b>is forbidden to a common priest, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state that she is forbidden <b>to a High Priest?</b> But if it is not necessary to mention it, <b>why</b> is the prohibition with regard to a divorcée to a High Priest <b>stated?</b> It is in order to teach the following: <b>Just as</b> the prohibition with regard to <b>a divorcée is distinct from</b> that of <b>a <i>zona</i> and a <i>ḥalala</i> in</b> the case of <b>a common priest,</b> as a divorcée is forbidden by a separate prohibition for which he is liable to be flogged, <b>so too,</b> the prohibition with regard to a divorcée is <b>distinct in</b> the case of <b>a High Priest,</b> and he will be liable to receive lashes for a separate prohibition if she was a <i>ḥalala</i> as well.
The Gemara questions this statement: This <b>is obvious; is</b> the status of a High Priest any <b>lower</b> than that of a common priest? Since this <i>halakha</i> applied to him when he was a common priest, it certainly applies to him when he becomes a High Priest. His restrictions as a priest are not lessened when he becomes a High Priest. <b>Rather,</b> teach as follows: <b>Just as</b> the prohibition with regard to <b>a divorcée is distinct from</b> that of <b>a <i>zona</i> and a <i>ḥalala</i> in</b> the case of <b>a common priest,</b> since he is liable to receive lashes for each of the prohibitions, <b>so too, a widow is distinct from a divorcée, and a <i>ḥalala</i>,</b> and <b>a <i>zona</i> in</b> the case of <b>a High Priest,</b> and he is liable to receive lashes for each prohibition, despite the fact that they are stated in the same verse (see Leviticus 21:14).
The <i>baraita</i> further asks: <b>Why is</b> the prohibition with regard to <b>a <i>ḥalala</i> stated</b> with regard to a High Priest, as she is forbidden to him even when he is a common priest? This repetition serves to teach that <b>a <i>ḥalala</i></b> results <b>only from a prohibition</b> addressed specifically to the <b>priesthood. Why is</b> the prohibition with regard to <b>a <i>zona</i> stated</b> with regard to a High Priest, as she is forbidden to him even when he is a common priest? <b>It is stated here: “<i>Zona</i>”</b> (Leviticus 21:14), with regard to a High Priest, <b>and it is stated there: “<i>Zona</i>”</b> (Leviticus 21:7), with regard to a common priest. <b>Just as here,</b> in the case of a High Priest who engages in sexual intercourse with a <i>zona</i>, <b>his offspring are profaned,</b> in accordance with the verse: “And he shall not profane his offspring” (Leviticus 21:15), <b>so too there, in</b> the case of a common priest who engages in intercourse with a <i>zona</i>, <b>his offspring are profaned.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi says: Consequently, a priest who engages in intercourse with his sister</b>

Daf 78a

<b>renders her a <i>zona</i>,</b> as he was forbidden to her, but <b>he does not render her a <i>ḥalala</i>,</b> since her status as a <i>zona</i> does not result from a prohibition specific to the priesthood, but due to the prohibition of a forbidden relative. If her brother, or any other priest, <b>again engaged in intercourse with her, he</b> thereby <b>makes her a <i>ḥalala</i>,</b> in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> pertaining to a priest who engages in intercourse with a <i>zona</i>.
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says: A High Priest</b> who engages in sexual intercourse <b>with a widow is flogged two</b> sets of lashes, <b>one</b> set <b>due to</b> transgressing the prohibition of: “A widow, or one divorced, or a <i>ḥalala</i>, or a <i>zona</i>, these <b>shall he not take”</b> (Leviticus 21:14), <b>and one</b> set <b>due to</b> transgressing the prohibition of: “And <b>he shall not profane”</b> (Leviticus 21:15), since he profanes the woman with whom he engages in intercourse. The Gemara asks: <b>And let him also be flogged</b> with a third set of lashes <b>due to</b> the complete phrase: <b>“He shall not profane his offspring,”</b> because the offspring resulting from that act of intercourse is a <i>ḥalal</i>. The Gemara answers: It is referring to a situation <b>where he did not complete his</b> act of sexual <b>intercourse.</b> Since this act does not lead to pregnancy, he is not flogged for profaning his offspring.
<b>Rava raises an objection</b> against Rav Yehuda’s statement from a mishna (<i>Makkot</i> 13a): A High Priest who engages in sexual intercourse with <b>a widow</b> who was previously <b>a divorcée is flogged due to two labels</b> of prohibitions. <b>What, is it not</b> stating that he is flogged due to <b>two labels and no more?</b> This indicates that he receives only one flogging for each prohibition, and not two as Rav Yehuda taught.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>No;</b> it means due to <b>two labels for this,</b> i.e., he is flogged two sets of lashes for engaging in intercourse with a widow, one for transgressing: “Shall he not take,” and one for transgressing: “He shall not profane,” <b>and two labels for that,</b> i.e., engaging in intercourse with a divorcée.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, say the latter clause</b> of that same mishna: If a priest engages in sexual intercourse with <b>a divorcée</b> who was <b>also a <i>yevama</i> who performed <i>ḥalitza</i> [<i>ḥalutza</i>], he is liable</b> to receive lashes <b>due to only one</b> transgression, since a <i>ḥalutza</i> is not forbidden to a priest by Torah law. This is contrary to the opinion of Rav Yehuda, that he should receive two sets of lashes for engaging in intercourse with a divorcée. The Gemara answers: <b>This is</b> what the mishna <b>is saying: He is liable</b> to receive lashes <b>due to only one</b> act, that of engaging in intercourse with a divorcée, <b>but actually</b> he is liable to receive two sets of lashes for his act of intercourse with a divorcée, since she is forbidden due to <b>two labels.</b> He does not receive an additional set of lashes on account of her being a <i>ḥalutza</i>, as this prohibition is by rabbinic law.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is <b>a <i>ḥalutza</i></b> forbidden to a priest only <b>by rabbinic law? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It states in the Torah that a priest may not marry <b>a divorcée. I have</b> derived <b>only a divorcée; from where</b> do I derive that <b>a <i>ḥalutza</i></b> is also forbidden? <b>The verse states: “And a woman</b> divorced” (Leviticus 21:7), with the additional conjunction of “and” serving to include a <i>ḥalutza</i>, that she is also considered to be a type of divorced woman. The Gemara rejects this: Even so, this prohibition is only <b>by rabbinic law, and the verse is a mere support,</b> but it is not the true source of the <i>halakha</i>.
<b>Abaye says:</b> A priest who <b>betrothed</b> a woman forbidden to him <b>is flogged;</b> if he <b>engaged in sexual intercourse</b> with her he <b>is flogged</b> additional lashes. The Gemara clarifies this: If he <b>betrothed,</b> he <b>is flogged due to</b> transgressing the prohibition of: <b>“Shall he not take.”</b> If he also <b>engaged in intercourse,</b> he <b>is flogged due to</b> transgressing the prohibition of: <b>“He shall not profane.” Rava says:</b> If he <b>engaged in intercourse</b> he <b>is flogged;</b> if he <b>did not engage in intercourse, he is not flogged</b> at all, <b>because it is written: “Shall he not take…and he shall not profane,”</b> which Rava understands to mean: <b>For what reason</b> is he commanded <b>not to take?</b> It is <b>so that he not profane.</b> Rava holds that he is not liable for taking, i.e., betrothing, the woman, but only for engaging in intercourse with her, as this leads to profanation.
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> although <b>Abaye</b> holds that the act of betrothal itself is forbidden, he <b>concedes in</b> the case of an Israelite who <b>remarries his divorcée</b> after she had been married to someone else in the interim, <b>that if he betrothed</b> her <b>without engaging in intercourse, he is not flogged.</b> Why not? It is as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah with regard to this prohibition: <b>“Take her again to be his wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:4), which indicates that the act of betrothal is forbidden only if it leads to the intimacy of marriage, <b>and</b> there is <b>no</b> such intimacy here since he has not engaged in intercourse with her.
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>Rava concedes in</b> the case of <b>a High Priest with a widow, that if he engaged in sexual intercourse without betrothing</b> her, <b>he is flogged</b> for the act of intercourse, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And he shall not profane his offspring among his people”</b> (Leviticus 21:15), <b>and he has profaned</b> her with his act of intercourse. <b>And they both concede in</b> the case of the prohibition with regard to <b>one who remarries his divorcée that if he engaged in intercourse</b> with her <b>without betrothing</b> her <b>he is not flogged,</b> because <b>the Torah forbade</b> them to reestablish their union only <b>through the manner of taking,</b> i.e., betrothal, but it did not prohibit the act of intercourse on its own.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: The daughter of a male convert is like the daughter of</b> a male <b><i>ḥalal</i>,</b> and is prohibited from marrying into the priesthood. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: The daughter of a male convert is like the daughter of a male <i>ḥalal</i>,</b> and is prohibited from marrying into the priesthood. <b>And logic dictates</b> that this is so: <b>Just as</b> in the case of <b>a <i>ḥalal</i>, who comes from a fit drop</b> of semen, as both his parents are Jewish, <b>his daughter is</b> nevertheless <b>unfit</b> to marry into the priesthood, in the case of <b>a convert, who comes from an unfit drop,</b> as he was born a gentile, <b>is it not logical that his daughter should be unfit</b> to marry into the priesthood?
The Gemara counters this derivation: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a <i>ḥalal</i>?</b> He is notable <b>in that he is formed through a transgression,</b> whereas the gentile parents of a convert were permitted to engage in sexual intercourse with each other. Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> of the daughter of a <i>ḥalal</i> might be more stringent than the <i>halakha</i> of the daughter of a convert. The Gemara responds: The case of <b>a High Priest</b> who engages in intercourse <b>with a widow shall prove</b> that this aspect is not germane to the fitness of the offspring, <b>since the formation of</b> the High Priest <b>was not through a transgression, and</b> yet <b>his daughter is unfit</b> to marry into the priesthood, indicating that being formed through a transgression does not play a role in this matter.
The Gemara counters again: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a High Priest</b> who engages in intercourse <b>with a widow?</b> He is notable <b>in that his</b> act of <b>intercourse is a transgression.</b> This aspect is what leads to the stringent <i>halakha</i> that his daughter is unfit to marry into the priesthood. The Gemara responds: The case of <b>a <i>ḥalal</i> will prove</b> that this aspect is not germane to the fitness of the offspring, as his daughter is unfit despite the fact that his act of intercourse does not involve a transgression.
<b>And the derivation has reverted</b> to its starting point. <b>The aspect of this</b> person, a <i>ḥalal</i>, <b>is not like the aspect of that</b> person, a High Priest, as with regard to each of them there is a unique reason for the <i>halakha</i> to be stringent. Despite this, <b>their common denominator is that they are unlike most of the congregation,</b> in that they both differ from Jews of unflawed lineage, either because their formation or their act of sexual intercourse involved a transgression, and their daughters are therefore unfit to marry into the priesthood. <b>I will also bring</b> the case of <b>the convert, who is unlike most of the congregation, and</b> therefore <b>his daughter is</b> also <b>unfit to marry</b> into the priesthood.
This is rejected: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about their common denominator is that</b> the reason they are not like most of the congregation <b>includes an aspect of a transgression,</b> either with regard to their formation or to their act of intercourse. Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> of the daughter of a convert cannot be derived from them.
The Gemara modifies the proof: <b>Do not say</b> that <b>a High Priest</b> who engages in sexual intercourse <b>with a widow will prove</b> it; <b>rather, say</b> that <b>a first</b>-generation male <b>Egyptian</b> convert who married a first-generation female Egyptian convert <b>will prove</b> it. Although their intercourse does not involve a transgression, their offspring are nevertheless unfit to marry into the priesthood, as Egyptians may enter into the congregation only after three generations.
This proof is also rejected: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a first</b>-generation <b>Egyptian?</b> He is notable <b>in that he is not fit to enter into the congregation</b> at all, and that is why his offspring may not marry into the priesthood. The Gemara responds that <b>a <i>ḥalal</i> will prove</b> that this aspect is not germane to the fitness of the offspring, since his daughter is unfit to marry into the priesthood although his offspring may enter into the congregation.
<b>And the derivation has reverted</b> to its starting point, as the <i>halakha</i> of the daughter of a convert cannot be derived from the case of the Egyptian alone or from the case of the <i>ḥalal</i> alone. <b>The aspect of this</b> person, an Egyptian convert, <b>is not like the aspect of that</b> person, a <i>ḥalal</i>, as with regard to each of them there is a unique reason for the <i>halakha</i> to be stringent. Despite this, <b>their common denominator is that they are unlike most of the congregation,</b> in that they both differ from Jews of unflawed lineage and their <b>daughters are</b> consequently <b>unfit</b> to marry into the priesthood. <b>I will also bring</b> the case of <b>the convert, who is unlike most of the congregation, and</b> therefore <b>his daughter is</b> also <b>unfit to marry</b> into the priesthood.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about their common denominator is that they disqualify</b> the daughter of a priest from marrying a priest <b>through their</b> act of <b>intercourse,</b> which is not the case with a convert. The Gemara explains: <b>And Rabbi Yehuda</b> holds that <b>a convert also disqualifies</b> the daughter of a priest from marrying a priest <b>through his</b> act of <b>intercourse, and he derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the daughter of a convert is unfit to marry into the priesthood <b>by</b> means of an analogy derived from <b>the common factor</b> of two sources, i.e., <b>from this <i>halakha</i></b> of a <i>ḥalal</i> and of an Egyptian.
§ The mishna states that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says</b> that the daughter of <b>a convert</b> and a Jewish woman is fit to marry into the priesthood. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: A female</b> who <b>converts</b> at <b>less than three years and one day</b> old <b>is fit to</b> marry into <b>the priesthood, as it is stated</b> after the war with Midian: <b>“But all the female children</b> who have not known a man by lying with him, <b>keep alive for yourselves”</b> (Numbers 31:18), i.e., you may marry them. <b>But wasn’t Pinehas</b> the priest <b>with them,</b> and yet the Torah permitted these women to all of them, which indicates that girls who are not of age when they convert are permitted even to priests. <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that even a girl who converts at less than three years and one day old is unfit to marry into the priesthood, interpret this verse? In their opinion, <b>“keep alive for yourselves”</b> means <b>as slaves and as maidservants,</b> but not for marriage.
The Gemara comments: <b>And all of</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> who have a dispute with regard to the fitness of the daughter of a convert for marrying into the priesthood <b>expounded a single verse.</b> It states with regard to priests: <b>“Neither shall they take as their wives a widow, nor her that divorced; but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel”</b> (Ezekiel 44:22). <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds:</b> A priest may marry a woman <b>only if the entire seed is from</b> those born to <b>the Jewish people,</b> but not if one of the parents is a convert. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov holds: “Of the seed</b> of the house of Israel” indicates that not all of the seed must come from the house of Israel, <b>and even</b> if <b>part of the seed</b> is from the house of Israel, that is sufficient to allow her to marry a priest.
<b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who holds that even the daughter of two converts is permitted to marry into the priesthood, <b>holds</b> that “of the seed of the house of Israel” means <b>one who was seeded,</b> i.e., conceived, <b>in Israel,</b> and the children of converts were conceived by Jewish parents. And <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai,</b> who permits a female who converted at less than three years and one day old to marry into the priesthood, <b>holds</b> that the phrase “virgins of the seed of the house of Israel” is referring to <b>one whose hymen was formed as a Jew,</b> i.e., a woman who was already Jewish when her hymen completed its formation, which occurs at the age of three.
<b>Rav Naḥman said to Rava:</b>

Daf 78b

Concerning <b>this verse</b> from Ezekiel, <b>the first clause</b> addresses a case <b>with a High Priest,</b> as it states that he may not marry a widow, <b>and the latter clause</b> addresses a case <b>with a common priest,</b> as it states that he may marry a widow. Is that a reasonable manner in which to interpret a verse? Rava <b>said to him: Yes,</b> that is the correct interpretation of the verse.
Rav Naḥman proceeded to ask: <b>But</b> can <b>a verse be written</b> in <b>this way,</b> addressing two different subjects without any demarcation? Rava <b>said to him: Yes,</b> and there is a similar case, <b>as it is written: “And the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down to sleep in the Temple of the Lord”</b> (I Samuel 3:3). If read literally, this verse is puzzling. It apparently states that Samuel was lying in the Sanctuary, <b>but there is</b> a right to <b>sit in the courtyard</b> of the Temple <b>only for the kings of the house of David alone.</b> How then could Samuel be laid down to sleep in the Temple? <b>Rather,</b> the verse should be understood as follows: <b>“And the lamp of God was not yet gone out” in the Temple of the Lord, “and Samuel was laid down” in his place</b> outside the Temple.
Since the Gemara quoted the verse in Ezekiel, it proceeds to discuss it further. The continuation of that verse states: <b>“And a widow who is the widow of a priest, they may take”</b> (Ezekiel 44:22). Does this mean that a priest may marry the widow <b>of a priest, yes,</b> but the widow <b>of an Israelite</b> he <b>may not</b> marry? This is counter to the <i>halakha</i> that allows a priest to marry any widow. Rather, <b>this is</b> what the verse <b>is saying:</b> “And a widow who is the widow, <b>of a priest they may take,”</b> meaning that <b>of the rest of the priests, they may take.</b> In other words, it is permitted for all other priests, i.e., common priests, to marry widows, and only the High Priest may not marry them. <b>That is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Of a priest they may take”</b> means <b>of the rest of the priests, they may take.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehuda states</b> a different explanation of the verse: A widow who is the widow <b>of one</b> whose daughters are <b>fit to marry into the priesthood, they may take.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning</b> above, <b>as he says: The daughter of a male convert is like the daughter of a male <i>ḥalal</i>,</b> and he ruled that <b>anyone whose daughter you may marry, you may</b> likewise <b>marry his widow; anyone whose daughter you may not marry,</b> e.g., a male convert, <b>you may not marry his widow</b> either. The verse therefore states that a priest may marry the widow only of one whose daughter is permitted to marry into the priesthood.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Even</b> if there was a male <b>convert who married</b> a female <b>convert,</b> his daughter is fit to marry into the priesthood. <b>Rav Hamnuna says in the name of Ulla:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, and similarly, Rabba bar bar Ḥana says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei. And from the day the Temple was destroyed, the priests were accustomed</b> to act with <b>a higher standard for themselves, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov,</b> and they would marry the daughter of a convert only if one parent was born Jewish.
<b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> Rav <b>Huna said to me:</b> If a priest <b>comes to consult</b> with us as to whether or not he should marry the daughter of two converts, <b>we instruct him</b> not to, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.</b> But if <b>he married</b> her, <b>we do not remove her from him, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> as the <i>halakha</i> follows his opinion, as stated above.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who says: This son of mine</b> is <b>a <i>mamzer</i>,</b> e.g., if he claims that the son was born to one forbidden to him by a prohibition that carries the punishment of <i>karet</i>, <b>he is not deemed credible</b> to render him a <i>mamzer</i>. <b>And even</b> if <b>both of them,</b> the father and the mother, <b>admit that a fetus in her womb is a <i>mamzer</i>, they are not deemed credible. Rabbi Yehuda says: They are deemed credible.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is</b> the added novelty indicated by the phrase: <b>And even</b> if <b>both of them?</b> What is taught there that is not stated in the clause that taught that a father is not deemed credible to state that his son is a <i>mamzer</i>? The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary. It is not necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>his</b> claim, <b>when it is not clear to him,</b> i.e., a father can never be sure that a child is his. <b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is the same <b>even</b> with regard to <b>her, when it is clear</b> to her who the father is, and yet <b>she is</b> nevertheless <b>not deemed credible. And</b> additionally, <b>it is not necessary</b> to state <b>when</b> the child <b>has a presumption of unflawed</b> lineage, as he was assumed to be of unflawed lineage before his parents came to testify, <b>that they are not deemed credible. Rather, even</b> in the case of <b>a fetus, who does not have a presumption of unflawed</b> lineage, as he has no status with regard to lineage until he is born, the parents <b>are</b> likewise <b>not deemed credible.</b>
The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: They are deemed credible.</b> This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Expounding the verse: <b>“He shall acknowledge</b> the firstborn” (Deuteronomy 21:17), the Sages said: <b>He,</b> the father, <b>shall acknowledge him to others.</b> In other words, he is deemed credible to tell others that this is his firstborn. <b>From here, Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that <b>a person is deemed credible to say: This is my firstborn son. And just as a person is deemed credible to say: This is my firstborn son, so too, a person is deemed credible to say</b> about his son: <b>This is a son of a divorced woman, or: This is a son of a <i>ḥalutza</i>. And the Rabbis say:</b> As far as these latter claims are concerned, <b>he is not deemed credible.</b> He is deemed credible only to state which son is his firstborn.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to Rava: Granted,</b> according <b>to Rabbi Yehuda, this is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “He shall acknowledge,”</b> as he derives from these words that a father is deemed credible to attest to the identity of his sons. <b>But</b> according <b>to the Rabbis</b> in the mishna, <b>why do I</b> need the phrase <b>“he shall acknowledge”?</b>
The Gemara answers: It is necessary for a case <b>when he requires identification,</b> if the identity of the firstborn is unknown. In such a situation the verse teaches that the father is deemed credible. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is this relevant? Does it refer to the requirement: <b>“By giving him a double portion”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17), i.e., that the firstborn receives a double share of the inheritance? <b>Isn’t</b> it <b>obvious</b> that he is deemed credible with regard to this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> to teach this? His claim is supported by the fact that <b>he could have made a more advantageous claim [<i>miggo</i>]: If he desired to give him</b> a double portion as <b>a gift</b> while he was alive, <b>would</b> the court <b>not give it to him?</b> Since the father could have given a double portion to the firstborn without having to testify that he is his firstborn, it cannot be that the verse is teaching us that he is deemed credible with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that a firstborn receives a double portion of inheritance.
The Gemara answers: The verse is referring <b>to property that came</b> into his possession <b>at a later point,</b> which he was unable to give to his son at the time that he came to testify. The verse teaches that the son whom the father states is the firstborn will receive a double portion even of that property.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rabbi Meir, who says</b> that <b>a person can transfer an entity that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world,</b> which would mean that a person can give away his property even before it enters his possession, <b>why do I</b> need the verse: <b>“He shall acknowledge”?</b> The Gemara answers: It is referring to a case <b>where property came into</b> the father’s possession <b>when he was moribund,</b> at which point he cannot transfer ownership of any of his property to others. It is with regard to such property that the verse states: “He shall acknowledge,” to teach that the son whom the father states is the firstborn will receive a double portion even of that property.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case of <b>one who authorized his agent to betroth his daughter</b> to a man that the agent would deem fit, <b>and</b> the father <b>went and betrothed her</b> to someone else, <b>if his</b> betrothal <b>preceded</b> that of the agent, <b>his betrothal is</b> a valid <b>betrothal; and if</b> the betrothal <b>of his agent preceded</b> his own, the <b>betrothal</b> of the agent <b>is</b> a valid <b>betrothal. And if it is not known</b> whose betrothal came first,

Daf 79a

<b>both</b> men who might have betrothed her <b>give</b> her <b>a bill of divorce</b> in order to render her permitted to marry someone else. <b>And if they wish</b> and agree between them, <b>one gives a bill of divorce and the other</b> marries her.
<b>And similarly,</b> with regard to <b>a woman who authorized her agent to betroth her and</b> she then <b>went and betrothed herself</b> to someone else, <b>if her</b> own betrothal <b>preceded</b> that of the agent, <b>her betrothal is</b> a valid <b>betrothal, and if</b> that <b>of her agent preceded</b> hers, the agent’s <b>betrothal is</b> a valid <b>betrothal. And if they do not know</b> whose betrothal came first, <b>both</b> men who may have betrothed her <b>give her a bill of divorce. And if they wish, one may give a bill of divorce and the other marries</b> her.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> with regard to one who betroths his daughter as well as with regard to a woman who betroths herself. <b>As had</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> only <b>with regard to</b> the father <b>himself,</b> one might say <b>that</b> it is <b>because a man is expert with regard to lineage,</b> and his decision to betroth his daughter on his own after having appointed an agent must have been due to the superior lineage of the man that he found willing to marry her. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a woman, who is not expert with regard to lineage,</b> one might <b>say her betrothal should not be</b> considered a valid <b>betrothal,</b> as she still intends for her agent to be able to accept betrothal for her from a man with superior lineage.
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>had</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> only <b>with regard to</b> the woman <b>herself,</b> one might say <b>that</b> it is <b>because a woman is particular</b> about whom <b>she marries,</b> i.e., she is careful when selecting a husband for herself. Therefore, she would have chosen the partner she deems most suitable and would not want the agent to act on her behalf after she had found someone on her own. <b>But</b> with regard to the father, one might <b>say</b> that <b>he does not care</b> to the same extent, and he may authorize the agent to act in any case. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to include both cases.
§ <b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> discussed the following question: If <b>her father betrothed her on the way,</b> when he was traveling, <b>and</b> in the meantime she <b>betrothed herself in the city, and she is</b> now <b>a grown woman, Rav said: She is a grown woman at present,</b> and her father cannot currently betroth her. Therefore, even if he did betroth her at some point, his betrothal is assumed not to have taken effect. <b>And Shmuel said: We are concerned with regard to the betrothal of both of them.</b>
The Gemara clarifies the case: <b>When</b> did the father’s betrothal occur? <b>If we say</b> it occurred <b>during the six</b> months when the daughter was no longer a minor and had the status of a young woman, <b>in that</b> case would <b>Rav say: She is a grown woman at present?</b> It is reasonable to say that <b>it is</b> only <b>now</b> that <b>she has reached her majority,</b> i.e., assumed the status of a grown woman, and in that case her father’s betrothal should take effect, since a father can betroth his daughter when she is a young woman. Rav would not rule that the father’s betrothal is disregarded. <b>Rather,</b> perhaps it occurred <b>after</b> the <b>six</b> months had elapsed since she became a young woman. <b>In that</b> case would <b>Shmuel say: We are concerned with regard to the betrothal of both of them? But doesn’t Shmuel say: The difference between</b> the status of <b>a young woman and</b> the status of <b>a grown woman is six months alone,</b> after which the girl has the status of a grown woman, which means her father can no longer betroth her?
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where he betrothed</b> her <b>on the day that</b> these <b>six</b> months <b>were completed. Rav said: She is a grown woman at present.</b> There is therefore a presumption <b>that since</b> she is <b>now a grown woman, she</b> was <b>also a grown woman</b> when her father betrothed her <b>in the morning. And Shmuel said:</b> Perhaps <b>it is</b> only <b>now that her signs</b> indicating puberty <b>came,</b> but she might have still been a young woman when her father betrothed her.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Shmuel,</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> the case of a <b>ritual bath? As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 2:2): With regard to <b>a ritual bath</b> that was known to have contained the requisite forty <i>se’a</i> of water, <b>which was</b> then <b>measured and found deficient</b> in its quantity of water, what is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>All pure items whose</b> purification <b>had been performed in it,</b> i.e., any impure items that had been purified through immersion in this ritual bath, <b>retroactive</b> to when the ritual bath was last measured, <b>whether</b> this ritual bath is found <b>in the private domain or in the public domain, are impure.</b> This indicates that the current situation, i.e., the deficient ritual bath, is presumed to extend back until when it was known with certainty to have contained the requisite amount of water. In this case too, the woman should be considered a grown woman at the time of the first betrothal, and the second betrothal should not take effect.
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of a ritual bath, it <b>is different, since it can be said: Maintain an impure</b> item <b>in its presumptive status and say</b> that <b>it was not</b> properly <b>immersed.</b> There, the presumptive status of the item being ritually impure is supported by the current state of the ritual bath, which is now deficient.
The Gemara continues to compare the two cases: <b>On the contrary,</b> it could be said: <b>Maintain the ritual bath in its presumptive status,</b> that it was known to have previously contained the requisite forty <i>se’a</i>, <b>and say</b> that <b>it was not deficient</b> at the time of the immersion and that the items should be considered ritually pure. The Gemara answers: <b>There is a deficient</b> ritual bath <b>at present,</b> which counteracts the presumptive status that it contained the requisite forty <i>se’a</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>Here too, there is a grown woman before you,</b> which should counteract the fact that she was previously a young woman. The Gemara answers: In this case, <b>it is</b> only <b>now</b> that <b>she has reached her majority.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>There too,</b> in the case of a ritual bath, one can also say <b>it is</b> only <b>now</b> that <b>it has become deficient.</b> Perhaps it contained the requisite forty <i>se’a</i> shortly beforehand.
The Gemara responds: <b>There,</b> in the case of the ritual bath, there are <b>two</b> reasons <b>to weaken</b> the possibility that the items are ritually pure: First, there is a deficient ritual bath at present; second, the item has a presumptive status of impurity. <b>Here,</b> by contrast, there is only <b>one</b> reason <b>to weaken</b> the possibility that she was a young woman at the time of the betrothal, i.e., the fact that she is now a grown woman. Shmuel therefore maintains that her earlier status of young woman is not nullified, and both betrothals must be taken into account.
The Gemara poses another question: <b>And</b> according to <b>Shmuel,</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> the case of <b>a barrel? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Terumot</i> 2:8): If <b>one would inspect</b> the contents of <b>a barrel</b> to see if it still contained enough wine <b>to continually</b> mentally <b>separate <i>teruma</i> from it</b> to exempt other untithed wine he had, until all the wine in that barrel would be <i>teruma</i> and would be given to a priest, <b>and afterward</b> the contents of the barrel <b>were found</b> to be <b>vinegar,</b> which cannot be set aside as <i>teruma</i> for untithed wine, then <b>all three days</b> after he had last inspected it is <b>definitely</b> viewed as having been wine, and any untithed wine for which <i>teruma</i> was separated during those days is tithed. <b>From then onward,</b> more than three days after the previous inspection, it is <b>uncertain</b> as to whether it had already turned to vinegar, and any untithed wine for which <i>teruma</i> was separated during those days is not tithed.
Before stating the difficulty with Shmuel’s opinion, the Gemara first clarifies the <i>baraita</i>. <b>And we raised a contradiction between</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>barrel</b> and that <b>of</b> the <b>ritual bath: What is different</b> in <b>that here,</b> with regard to the ritual bath, the <i>halakha</i> is that the items are <b>definitely</b> impure, <b>and what is different</b> in <b>that there,</b> with regard to the barrel, it is only <b>uncertain</b> whether the produce remains untithed? In both cases the situation at present, the ritual bath being deficient and the contents of the barrel having turned to vinegar, should lead to a definite conclusion.
The Gemara continues its analysis of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And Rav Ḥanina from Syria says: Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> that <b>taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>barrel? It is Rabbi Shimon, who with regard to a ritual bath also considers</b> it <b>as</b> a matter of <b>uncertainty</b> rather than as definitively impure. Therefore, there is no contradiction between the <i>baraita</i> and the mishna.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All pure items whose</b> purification <b>had been performed in it,</b> i.e., any impure items that had been purified through immersion in the ritual bath that was found to be deficient, <b>retroactive</b> to when the ritual bath was last measured, <b>whether</b> this ritual bath is found <b>in the private domain or in the public domain, are impure. And Rabbi Shimon says</b> they are impure due to the uncertainty, and therefore, if the ritual bath was located <b>in the public domain, they are pure,</b> in accordance with the principle that uncertain cases of impurity in the public domain are deemed pure. But if the ritual bath was located <b>in the private domain,</b> the decision <b>is suspended,</b> i.e., if the impure items came into contact with <i>teruma</i>, one may not partake of the <i>teruma</i> due to the uncertainty, but it is also not burned as though it were definitely impure.
The Gemara returns to complete the difficulty with Shmuel’s opinion: <b>But</b> according <b>to the Rabbis,</b> who hold that in the case of the ritual bath the items are definitely impure, with regard to the wine that had been exempted from <i>teruma</i> by means of separating <i>teruma</i> from the contents of the barrel, that wine will be <b>untithed produce retroactively,</b> since they hold that the current status extends to the past. This is unlike the ruling of Shmuel, who ruled that in the case of the woman who was betrothed to two men it is uncertain to whom she is betrothed. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of the barrel, <b>it is different, as it can be said: Maintain the untithed produce in its presumptive status,</b> as when it first grew it was definitely untithed, <b>and say</b> it was <b>not fixed,</b> i.e., exempted.
The Gemara asks: <b>On the contrary,</b> why not <b>maintain the wine in its presumptive status, and say it had not turned to vinegar?</b> The Gemara rejects this: That is impossible, as <b>it is turned to vinegar at present.</b> The Gemara replies: In the case of the betrothal, <b>here too, she is a grown woman at present;</b> what is the difference? The Gemara rejects this claim: With regard to the woman, <b>it is</b> possible that only <b>now has she reached her majority.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>Here too,</b> it could be that <b>it is</b> only <b>now</b> that <b>it has turned to vinegar,</b> but not earlier.
The Gemara explains: <b>There,</b> in the case of the barrel, there are <b>two</b> reasons <b>to weaken</b> the possibility that the wine is tithed: First, it is vinegar at present; second, the wine has a presumptive status of being untithed. <b>Here,</b> by contrast, <b>there is</b> only <b>one</b> reason <b>to weaken</b> the possibility that she was a young woman at the time of the betrothal, i.e., the fact that she is now a grown woman. Shmuel therefore maintains that her earlier status of a young woman is not nullified, and both betrothals must be taken into account.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that it is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>:</b>

Daf 79b

The <i>halakha</i> is that a moribund person who transfers all of his property to others without leaving anything for himself can retract his bequest upon regaining his health. This is due to the assumption that one would give away all his possessions only if he believes he is going to die, and the bequest was therefore made in error. By contrast, if a healthy person gave all his property to others, he cannot later retract his bequest. The <i>tanna’im</i> discuss the case of one who gave away all his property and later, seeking to retrieve his property, claims that he was moribund at the time, while the recipients of the bequest maintain that he was healthy. <b>Who</b> is able to <b>remove</b> the property <b>from the possession of whom?</b>
<b>He</b> is able to <b>remove</b> his property held by others <b>from their possession without</b> needing to bring <b>proof</b> that he was moribund at the time, <b>and they may not remove</b> the property <b>from his possession,</b> if he still is in possession of the property, <b>without proof</b> that he was healthy. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Ya’akov. Rabbi Natan says: If he is</b> currently <b>healthy,</b> the obligation <b>is upon him to bring proof that he was on his deathbed</b> at the time of the bequest, <b>and if he is</b> now <b>on his deathbed,</b> the obligation <b>is upon them to bring proof that he was healthy</b> at the time of the bequest.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>Rav spoke in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan</b> that one’s current status is paramount, <b>and Shmuel spoke in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov,</b> who holds that the question of whether he was moribund remains a matter of uncertainty, and they may not claim the property from him even if he is now healthy. The Gemara rejects this: <b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you: I spoke even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov,</b> as <b>Rabbi Ya’akov states</b> his opinion <b>only there,</b> because <b>it can be said</b> that the principle of: <b>Leave</b> the <b>property in its</b> previous <b>status,</b> applies, so the property should remain where it is. <b>But here,</b> with regard to the question of when a young woman became a grown woman, <b>shall we say: Establish the body</b> according <b>to its previous status?</b> It is obvious that her body was due to mature.
<b>And Shmuel</b> could have <b>said: I spoke even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan,</b> since <b>Rabbi Natan states</b> his opinion that the current state is paramount <b>only there, as everyone has a presumptive status of being healthy.</b> Consequently, if <b>a person removes himself from</b> this <b>presumption</b> by claiming he was moribund, the obligation falls <b>upon him to bring proof. But here, does</b> she <b>remove herself from a presumption that was present?</b> There is no presumption that she was a grown woman in the morning.
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that this dispute between Rav and Shmuel <b>is parallel to</b> a dispute between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i>:</b> With regard to a case where <b>her father betrothed her on the way,</b> when he was traveling, <b>and</b> in the meantime she <b>betrothed herself in the city, and she is</b> now <b>a grown woman, one</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>taught: She is a grown woman at present,</b> and her father cannot currently betroth her; therefore, his betrothal does not take effect. <b>And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>We are concerned with regard to the betrothal of both of them. What, is it not</b> the case <b>that one</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, and one</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel?</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>No;</b> it is possible that both <b>this and that are in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel. Here,</b> in this <i>baraita</i>, it is referring to a case <b>where she denies his</b> right to betroth her, as she claims that she was a grown woman before his betrothal. <b>There,</b> it is referring to a situation <b>where she does not deny his</b> right to betroth her, and therefore it is uncertain which betrothal takes effect.
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let us</b> also <b>say</b> that <b>since the <i>baraitot</i> do not disagree, the</b> opinions of the <b><i>amora’im</i>,</b> Rav and Shmuel, <b>do not disagree</b> either. One is referring to a case where she denies her father’s right to betroth her, while the other is referring to a case where she does not. The Gemara rejects this: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand it that way? But Rav Yosef, son of Rav Menashya of Dabil, performed an action</b> in this case <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav</b> and did not take the father’s betrothal into account, <b>and Shmuel took offense</b> at this <b>and said</b> sarcastically: Is wisdom <b>measured out to everyone in a small measure, and measured out to this</b> member <b>of the Sages in a large measure?</b> He was angered that Rav Yosef had the audacity to rule against him in this case. <b>Now, if it enters your mind</b> that <b>they did not disagree</b> at all, <b>why did</b> Shmuel <b>take offense?</b>
<b>Perhaps when</b> Rav Yosef <b>performed an action,</b> he did so in an instance <b>where she denied</b> her father’s right to betroth her, in which case even Shmuel would agree that the father’s betrothal does not take effect. Rather, it must be that Rav and Shmuel did disagree, and Rav Yosef must have ruled in the case of a woman who did not deny her father’s right to betroth her, which explains why Shmuel took exception to his ruling.
<b>Mar Zutra said to Rav Ashi: This is what Ameimar said: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel. And Rav Ashi said: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who went overseas with his wife, and returned with his wife and children, and said: This is the woman who went overseas with me and these are her children,</b> he <b>is not required to bring proof with regard to</b> the lineage of <b>the woman,</b> since her lineage was already investigated at the time of their marriage, <b>nor with regard to</b> the lineage of <b>the children.</b> If he returned without the woman and said: My wife <b>died and these are her children,</b> he must <b>bring proof that the children</b> were born to his wife, <b>but he does not</b> need to <b>bring proof with regard to</b> the lineage of <b>the woman.</b>
If he left when he was unmarried and said upon his return: <b>I married a woman overseas, and this is she, and these are her children,</b> he must <b>bring proof with regard to</b> the lineage of <b>the woman, but</b> he <b>is not required to bring proof with regard to</b> the lineage of <b>the children.</b> If he said: I married a woman overseas and <b>she died, and these are her children,</b> he is <b>required to bring proof with regard to</b> both the lineage of <b>the woman and the children.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna says: And all of</b> the statements that he is not required to bring proof with regard to the lineage of the children are said <b>in</b> a case where <b>they cling to her</b> and treat the woman like their mother.
<b>The Sages taught</b> that if a man says: <b>I married a woman overseas,</b> he must <b>bring proof with regard to</b> the lineage of <b>the woman, but</b> he <b>is not required to bring proof with regard to</b> the lineage of <b>the children. And he</b> must <b>bring proof with regard to</b> the lineage of <b>the adult</b> children, <b>but</b> he <b>is not required to bring proof with regard to</b> the lineage of <b>the minor</b> children. Since their attachment to their mother is apparent, it can be assumed they are her offspring. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is <b>in</b> the case of one who said he married <b>one woman, but when</b> it is the case of one who said he married <b>two women</b> overseas, he must <b>bring proof with regard to</b> the lineage of both <b>the woman and the children, with regard to the adult</b> ones <b>and with regard to the minor</b> ones. Even if they cling to the woman whose lineage has been found to be unflawed, they might be the children of the other wife and are merely being raised by this one.
<b>Reish Lakish said:</b>

Daf 80a

The Sages <b>taught</b> that the children’s attachment to her proves that she is their mother <b>only with regard to the consecrated</b> items of <b>the border,</b> i.e., <i>teruma</i>, meaning that if she is the wife of a priest, her children may partake of <i>teruma</i>. <b>But with regard to lineage,</b> this proof is <b>not</b> relied upon, and her daughters may not marry priests. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If the children cling to her they are considered hers in all regards, <b>even with regard to lineage.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan follows his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The court <b>flogs</b> one about whom witnesses testify that he violated a prohibition <b>on the</b> basis of <b>presumptive status,</b> even if there is no testimony to definitively establish that the person violated a prohibition, as will be explained. Similarly, the court <b>stones or burns</b> one about whom witnesses testify that he violated a prohibition resulting in court-imposed capital punishment <b>on the</b> basis of <b>presumptive status. But one does not burn <i>teruma</i> on the</b> basis of <b>presumptive status</b> unless there is testimony that it became ritually impure.
How so? The court <b>flogs</b> one about whom witnesses testify that he violated a prohibition <b>on the</b> basis of <b>presumptive status, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda. As Rav Yehuda says:</b> If a woman <b>had</b> among <b>her neighbors the presumptive status of a menstruating woman,</b> and witnesses testified that <b>her husband</b> engaged in sexual intercourse with her, he <b>is flogged due to</b> her status as <b>a menstruating woman,</b> and there is no need for testimony that she was a menstruating woman.
The court <b>stones or burns</b> one about whom witnesses testify that he violated a prohibition resulting in court-imposed capital punishment <b>on the</b> basis of <b>presumptive status, in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabba bar Rav Huna. As Rabba bar Rav Huna says:</b> With regard to <b>a man and a woman</b> and <b>a boy and a girl who grew up</b> together <b>in</b> one <b>home</b> as a single family, the presumption is that they are related, even absent witness testimony to that effect. Therefore, <b>they are stoned due to</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>each other</b> if the male child, now an adult, engages in intercourse with the woman, as it is considered incestuous sexual intercourse. <b>And they are burned due to</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>each other</b> if the man engages in intercourse with the female child, now an adult, since she is considered his wife’s daughter.
The Gemara cites a related incident: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says in the name of bar Kappara: An incident</b> occurred <b>involving a woman who came to Jerusalem with a child riding on her shoulders,</b> in the manner of a mother and a son, <b>and she raised him, and he</b> eventually <b>engaged in intercourse with her. And they brought them to court and stoned them</b> for violating the prohibition against a mother and son engaging in intercourse. This was <b>not because he</b> was <b>definitely her son,</b> as they had no testimony to that effect, <b>but because he clung to her,</b> and he therefore had the presumptive status of being her son.
Rabbi Yoḥanan stated: <b>But one does not burn <i>teruma</i> on the</b> basis of <b>presumptive status. As Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: One burns</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>on the</b> basis of <b>presumptive status, and Rabbi Yoḥanan says: One does not burn</b> <i>teruma</i> in this case. The Gemara comments: <b>And they follow their</b> standard lines of <b>reasoning</b> in this matter, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 3:8): If a ritually impure <b>child is found alongside</b> ritually pure <b>started dough, and</b> he has <b>risen dough in his hand</b> that may have been removed from the larger portion of started dough, <b>Rabbi Meir deems</b> the started dough <b>pure,</b> since there is no proof the child touched it, as he might have been given the piece by someone else. <b>And the Rabbis deem it impure,</b> as they assume that he touched the started dough. The child is presumed to be impure <b>because it is the manner of a child to handle [<i>letappe’aḥ</i>]</b> items.
<b>And we discussed</b> that case: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Meir? He holds</b> that <b>a majority of children handle</b> items, in this case the dough, that are within reach, <b>and a minority do not handle</b> items within reach, <b>and</b> the <b>dough</b> itself <b>retains a presumptive status of purity,</b> since its impurity has not been definitively determined. <b>And</b> if one <b>appends</b> the <b>minority</b> of children who do not handle items within reach <b>to the presumptive status</b> of purity of the dough, the force of the <b>majority</b> of children who handle items within reach <b>is weakened.</b> Therefore, the dough is considered pure. <b>And the Rabbis</b> contend that in a case where the majority is followed, <b>the minority is considered like it does not exist.</b> Consequently, there is a conflict between the determining factors of <b>the majority</b> of impure children who handle items within reach <b>and the presumptive status of purity</b> of the dough. In that case, <b>the majority takes precedence.</b>
<b>Reish Lakish says in the name of Rabbi Oshaya: This</b> <i>halakha</i> of a child <b>is</b> an example of a presumption, i.e., that children handle items within reach, <b>that one burns <i>teruma</i> based on it,</b> since the Rabbis hold that it is sufficiently established that the dough has become impure to allow it to be burned. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This is not the presumption that one burns <i>teruma</i> based on it.</b> Rather, the dough is set aside and may be neither eaten nor burned.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, what is the presumption that one burns <i>teruma</i> based on it?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where <b>started dough is in the house, and creeping animals,</b> which impart impurity when dead, <b>and frogs,</b> which do not impart impurity, <b>are</b> also <b>present there, and pieces</b> of an unidentified creature <b>were found in the started dough, if the majority</b> of creatures in the house <b>are creep-ing animals,</b> the dough <b>is impure,</b> since the presumption is that the pieces are from a creeping animal. <b>If the majority are frogs, it is pure.</b>
The Gemara comments: It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> There is a principle that when a possible case of impurity cannot be verified, even if it occurred in a private domain, where generally cases of uncertain impurity are deemed impure, it is deemed pure. <b>Two things do not have the capacity to be questioned,</b> i.e., one cannot verify what happened through investigation. Yet in these two cases, <b>the Sages deemed them as things that have the capacity to be questioned</b> and rendered them impure in cases of uncertainty in a private domain. The two cases are that of <b>a child and an additional</b> <i>halakha</i>.
The case of <b>a child</b> is <b>that which we said</b> concerning a child holding some dough discovered alongside a larger piece of dough. All of the dough is deemed impure, since the child cannot be asked whether or not he rendered the dough impure. <b>And what is the additional</b> one? If pure, <b>started dough</b> was located <b>inside the house, and chickens and impure liquids</b> were present <b>there, and there were found</b> to be

Daf 80b

<b>small holes in the dough</b> where the chickens had pecked it, in that case the dough is <b>held in suspension; it is neither eaten nor burned,</b> since the chickens may have drunk from the impure liquids before they pecked at the dough but there is no proof of this. Despite this being a case where they cannot be asked, which generally would result in the dough being deemed pure, here it is deemed impure due to the uncertainty. The fact that in the second case of the <i>baraita</i> it is not deemed to be definitely impure supports the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, who holds that in the case of the child the status of the dough also remains a matter of uncertainty.
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only in</b> a case of <b>white liquid,</b> when the appearance of the peck marks provides no proof of whether the chickens had previously drunk from the liquid, <b>but in</b> a case of <b>red,</b> impure <b>liquid, if it is so that they had pecked, it would be known</b> that they had drunk from the liquid, since the peck marks would be colored red. The Gemara asks: Even if the liquid were red and there were no red marks on the dough, how can one say definitively that they did not peck? <b>Perhaps</b> the <b>dough absorbed</b> the liquid, leaving no identifiable mark?
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The Distinguished,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, <b>heard this matter, but he did not hear its interpretation,</b> and he should have supplied an additional detail: <b>They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only in</b> a case <b>of clear liquid,</b> which can be absorbed in the dough without leaving a stain. What is meant by clear? It means <b>that in which the reflection [<i>bavua</i>] of a child is recognizable</b> when he peers into it. <b>But</b> in a case of <b>murky liquid,</b> this <i>halakha</i> was <b>not</b> stated, since the liquid would have left a mark.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A man may not be secluded with two women</b> lest he sin with them, <b>but one woman may be secluded with two men. Rabbi Shimon says: Even one man may be secluded with two women when his wife is with him, and</b> in that situation he may even <b>sleep in</b> the same <b>inn</b> with two women, <b>because his wife guards him</b> from sinning with them. They further said that <b>a man may be secluded with his mother, and with his daughter, and sleep alongside them with bodily contact</b> without clothes, since there is no concern that they will engage in sexual intercourse. <b>And when they,</b> the son or daughter, <b>have grown up, this one sleeps in her garment and that one sleeps in his garment,</b> but they may share a bed.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is the reason</b> that a man may not be secluded with two women, but a woman may be secluded with two men? <b>The school of Eliyahu taught: Since women are of light mind</b> they are more easily seduced.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> that it is prohibited for a man to be secluded with women, derived? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: From where</b> is there <b>an allusion from the</b> Written <b>Torah to</b> the prohibition against <b>seclusion? As it is stated</b> concerning one who incites others to idolatrous worship: <b>“If your brother, the son of your mother, entices you”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:7).
Rabbi Yishmael considers why the Torah uses the example of “the son of your mother.” <b>But is it</b> only <b>the son of a mother</b> who <b>entices? Doesn’t the son of a father entice? Rather,</b> the verse means <b>to say to you: A son may be secluded with his mother.</b> Consequently, if a woman has two sons from two different husbands, they will both stay close to her. The Torah therefore uses the example of “the son of your mother” because half-brothers who share a mother become close to each other. By contrast, half-brothers who share a father will not become close, since one’s father’s wife who is not one’s mother is a forbidden relative. <b>And it is prohibited to be secluded with those with whom relations are forbidden by the Torah.</b>
Since this verse merely alludes to the prohibition against seclusion, the Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what is the plain</b> meaning <b>of the verse written,</b> i.e., in the context of enticement to idolatrous worship, why does it emphasize “the son of your mother”? <b>Abaye said:</b> The verse <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary. It is not necessary</b> to state that one should not be enticed by <b>the son of a father, who hates him</b> due to their rivalry for their father’s inheritance <b>and</b> therefore <b>gives him bad advice. Rather,</b> the same is true <b>even</b> of <b>the son of a mother,</b> who <b>does not hate him,</b> since they are not rivals for the same inheritance, as each inherits from his own father. One might therefore <b>say</b> that <b>he should listen to him</b> and accept his advice. The verse consequently <b>teaches us</b> that he should pay no heed to his enticements.
The Gemara comments: Shall <b>we say the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a child dies <b>any</b> time during the first <b>thirty days</b> after his birth, he is not given a proper funeral but <b>is carried out</b> held <b>in</b> their <b>bosom,</b> not on a bier, <b>and buried by one woman and two men. But</b> he <b>may not</b> be buried <b>by one man and two women,</b> due to the prohibition against seclusion. <b>Abba Shaul says:</b> He may <b>even</b> be buried <b>by one man and two women.</b> This indicates that Abba Shaul deems it permitted for a man to be secluded with two women.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>You</b> can <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul,</b> as he permits it only in the case of the <i>baraita</i>, because <b>at the time of acute mourning,</b> i.e., immediately after a close relative has died, one’s <b>inclination</b> to sin <b>is broken,</b> and there is no concern that he might come to sin.
<b>And the Rabbis,</b> who render seclusion forbidden even then, <b>hold in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, as Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> as follows with regard to the verse: <b>“Why does a living man complain, a powerful man due to his sins?”</b> (Lamentations 3:39): <b>Even at the time of a person’s acute mourning, his inclination</b> to sin <b>overpowers him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Abba Shaul</b> explain this verse? The Gemara answers: <b>When that was written, it was written</b> with regard <b>to one who complains about</b> God’s <b>ways. And this is</b> what the verse <b>is saying: Why does</b> one <b>complain about</b> God’s <b>ways</b> and claim that he has been treated unjustly? <b>Has he overpowered his sins?</b> God responds: <b>The life I have given him is sufficient for him,</b> and he deserves no more.
<b>And the Rabbis</b> are concerned about the possibility of sin even in times of acute mourning, <b>like that incident involving a certain woman, as there was an incident where she removed</b> her husband from his grave. When visiting her husband’s grave, she engaged in intercourse with a man who was tasked with guarding the body of one executed by the king. Meanwhile, that body was taken, and she suggested that they disinter her husband so that the guard could claim that he fulfilled his task properly. This demonstrates that even at a time of mourning one may succumb to temptation.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>But one woman</b> may be secluded with two men. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard <b>to</b> men of <b>fit</b> morals, <b>but with regard to</b> those <b>steeped</b> in sexual immorality, she may <b>not</b> be secluded <b>even with ten</b> men. <b>There was an incident where ten</b> men <b>carried out</b> a woman <b>on a bier,</b> as though she were dead, and engaged in intercourse with her. <b>Rav Yosef says: Know</b> that this is so, <b>since ten</b> people <b>will join together and steal a</b> heavy <b>beam without being ashamed before one another.</b> Similarly, several men can join together for a licentious act without shame.
The Gemara suggests: Shall <b>we say</b> the following mishna (<i>Sota</i> 7a) <b>supports him:</b> It was taught with regard to one who is bringing his wife, whom he suspects of having committed adultery [<i>sota</i>], to the Temple to perform the ritual of the bitter water, that <b>they provide him with two Torah scholars</b> to accompany them <b>lest he engage in sexual intercourse with her along the way,</b> as until the ritual has been performed she remains forbidden to her husband? It can be inferred from here: Two <b>Torah scholars, yes;</b> their presence will assure that no one will engage in forbidden intercourse. <b>Regular men, no;</b> there is still a concern that they may engage in intercourse. This indicates that ordinary people are not relied upon with regard to seclusion with a woman. The Gemara rejects this proof: The reason there is a need for them to be Torah scholars is that <b>Torah scholars are different, in that they know</b>

Daf 81a

how <b>to warn him</b> not to engage in intercourse with her, since that would neutralize the effectiveness of the examination of the waters.
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that two men may seclude themselves with one woman <b>only in a city,</b> where others are present, <b>but on the road</b> it is not permitted <b>unless there are three.</b> Why are two men insufficient on the road? <b>Perhaps one of them will need to urinate</b> and will walk away, <b>and it will turn out that one</b> person <b>will be secluded with a woman forbidden to him.</b> The Gemara suggests: Shall <b>we say</b> the mishna quoted above <b>supports him: They provide him with two Torah scholars</b> to accompany them <b>lest he engage in sexual intercourse with her along the way? He and two</b> Torah scholars <b>are three,</b> which indicates that there is a requirement for three men when they are traveling. The Gemara answers: That is no proof, as <b>there,</b> in the case of the <i>sota</i>, there is a requirement for an additional two men <b>in order that they should</b> serve as <b>witnesses about him,</b> to testify whether or not he engaged in intercourse with her along the way.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav and Rav Yehuda were walking along the way,</b> and <b>a certain woman was walking ahead of them. Rav said to Rav Yehuda: Raise your feet</b> and walk quickly <b>away from Gehenna</b> so that we do not remain secluded with her. Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: But wasn’t it</b> you, <b>Master, who said that</b> it is <b>permitted</b> in the case <b>of</b> men of <b>fit</b> morals? Rav <b>said to him: Who says</b> that I referred <b>to</b> men of <b>fit</b> morals <b>such as you and me?</b> Rav Yehuda responded: <b>Rather, such as whom?</b> Rav answered: <b>Such as Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappi and his colleagues,</b> who have proven that they can withstand temptation (see 39b). All other people are not trusted in this matter.
<b>Rav says:</b> The court <b>flogs</b> a man <b>due to</b> his being <b>secluded</b> with a woman. But a wife <b>is not forbidden</b> to her husband, and an unmarried woman is not prohibited from marrying a priest <b>due to</b> being <b>secluded,</b> as it cannot be stated definitively that the secluded pair engaged in sexual intercourse. <b>Rav Ashi says: We stated</b> the <i>halakha</i> that one is flogged <b>due to</b> being <b>secluded only</b> with <b>an unmarried</b> woman, <b>but for</b> being <b>secluded</b> with <b>a married woman,</b> one is <b>not</b> flogged. Why not? It is <b>so that there should not be rumors spread concerning her children.</b> If the secluded pair is flogged, everyone will assume that they engaged in intercourse, and people will consider her children to be <i>mamzerim</i>, whereas in fact they were flogged only for being secluded.
The Gemara relates: <b>Mar Zutra would</b> even <b>flog</b> one who was secluded with a married woman, <b>and he would proclaim</b> the reason for the punishment. <b>Rav Naḥman from Parhatya said to Rav Ashi: Let the Master also flog and proclaim</b> the reason. Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> I am hesitant to do so, in case <b>there are those who hear about this,</b> i.e., the flogging, <b>and do not hear about that,</b> i.e., the reason for the flogging.
<b>Rav says:</b> The court <b>flogs</b> one <b>due to</b> his being the subject of <b>a bad rumor,</b> meaning that not only is a person flogged when the facts have been ascertained, but even when he has only reportedly committed transgressions he may be flogged. <b>As it is stated: “No, my sons, for it is no good report”</b> (I Samuel 2:24). When <b>Mar Zutra</b> would flog a person for being the subject of a bad rumor, <b>he would place</b> the <b>bridle</b> of a donkey <b>on</b> the person’s <b>shoulders and recite before him</b> when administering lashes: <b>“No, my sons,</b> for it is no good report,” so that people would know why he was being flogged.
<b>Rabba says:</b> If a woman’s <b>husband is in town, there is no concern due to</b> her being <b>secluded</b> with a man. People are afraid to sin with her, since they cannot be sure when her husband will return. <b>Rav Yosef says:</b> If there is <b>an open entrance to the public domain there is no concern due to</b> being <b>secluded.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Beivai arrived at Rav Yosef’s house. After he wrapped</b> his <b>bread,</b> i.e., ate his meal, he <b>said to</b> the members of the household: <b>Remove the ladder from beneath Beivai,</b> who was going to sleep in the upper story, so that he not be able to climb down, due to the prohibition of being secluded with Rav Yosef’s wife. The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rabba say:</b> If <b>her husband is in town, there is no concern due to</b> her being <b>secluded</b> with a man? The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Beivai is different, since</b> Rav Yosef’s wife <b>was his friend and she was familiar with him,</b> and therefore there was more cause for concern.
<b>Rav Kahana says:</b> If the <b>men</b> are located <b>on the outside,</b> i.e., in the outer room, <b>and the women in the inside,</b> i.e., in the inner room, <b>there is no concern due to</b> being <b>secluded.</b> Even if one of the men were to enter the inner room, he would be seen by the other men. By contrast, if there were <b>men in the inside and women on the outside, there is a concern due to</b> being <b>secluded,</b> since one of the men can claim that he is leaving and in fact join the women.
The Gemara comments: <b>The opposite was taught in a <i>baraita</i>,</b> that if the men are on the outside and the women are inside there is concern due to being secluded, as one of the men might venture inside without being noticed, but if the men are inside and the women are outside, he knows that one of the other men might go out through the women’s quarters at any time, and therefore there is no concern due to being secluded. <b>Abaye said: Now that Rav Kahana has said</b> the <i>halakha</i> in <b>this</b> manner <b>and a <i>baraita</i> teaches the opposite, we shall act stringently</b> in both cases.
<b>Abaye</b> would <b>arrange rows</b> of <b>pitchers</b> between the men and women, so that they would not be able to cross from one area to the other without making noise. <b>Rava</b> would <b>arrange rows</b> of <b>reeds</b> to prevent passage. <b>Avin said: The wound [<i>sakva</i>],</b> i.e., the vulnerable point, <b>of the year</b> is <b>the Festival,</b> since men and women would come together on these joyous occasions, and this would lead to sin.
§ The Gemara relates: <b>Those captive</b> women <b>who were brought to Neharde’a,</b> where they were redeemed, <b>were brought up to the house of Rav Amram the Pious. They removed the ladder from before them</b> to prevent men from climbing up after them to the attic where they were to sleep. <b>When one of them passed</b> by the entrance to the upper chamber, it was as though <b>a light shone in the aperture</b> due to her great beauty. Out of his desire for her, <b>Rav Amram grabbed a ladder that ten</b> men <b>together could not lift, lifted it on his own</b> and <b>began climbing.</b>
<b>When he was halfway</b> up <b>the ladder, he strengthened</b> his legs against the sides of the ladder to stop himself from climbing further, <b>raised his voice,</b> and cried out: There is <b>a fire in the house of Amram.</b> Upon hearing this, <b>the Sages came</b> and found him in that position. <b>They said to him: You have embarrassed us,</b> since everyone sees what you had intended to do. Rav Amram <b>said to them: It is better that you be shamed in Amram’s house in this world, and not be ashamed of him in the World-to-Come. He took an oath that</b> his evil inclination <b>should emerge from him, and</b> an apparition <b>similar to a pillar of fire emerged from him. He said to</b> his evil inclination: <b>See, as you are fire and I am</b> mere <b>flesh, and</b> yet, <b>I am</b> still <b>superior to you,</b> as I was able to overcome you.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Meir would ridicule transgressors</b> by saying it is easy to avoid temptation. <b>One day, Satan appeared to him as a woman</b> standing <b>on the other side of the river.</b> Since <b>there was no ferry</b> to cross the river, <b>he took hold of a rope bridge and crossed</b> the river. <b>When he reached halfway</b> across <b>the rope bridge,</b> the evil inclination <b>left him and said</b> to him: <b>Were it not for</b> the fact that <b>they proclaim about you in heaven: Be careful with regard to Rabbi Meir and his Torah, I would have made your blood like two <i>ma’a</i>,</b> i.e., completely worthless, since you would have fallen completely from your spiritual level.
<b>Rabbi Akiva would</b> likewise <b>ridicule transgressors. One day, Satan appeared to him as a woman at the top of a palm tree.</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>grabbed hold of the palm tree and began climbing. When he was halfway up the palm tree,</b> the evil inclination <b>left him and said</b> to him: <b>Were it not for</b> the fact that <b>they proclaim about you in heaven: Be careful with regard to Rabbi Akiva and his Torah, I would have made your blood like two <i>ma’a</i>.</b>
The Sage <b>Peleimu had the habit to say every day: An arrow in the eye of Satan,</b> mocking the temptations of the evil inclination. <b>One day, it was the eve of Yom Kippur,</b> and Satan <b>appeared to him as a pauper</b> who <b>came and called</b> him <b>to the door,</b> requesting alms. Peleimu <b>brought out bread to him.</b> Satan <b>said to him: On a day like today, everyone is inside</b> eating, <b>and</b> shall <b>I</b> stand <b>outside</b> and eat? Peleimu <b>brought him inside and gave him bread. He said to him: On a day like today, everyone</b> is sitting <b>at the table, and</b> shall <b>I</b> sit <b>by myself? They brought him and sat him at the table. He was sitting</b> and had <b>covered himself with boils and pus, and he was doing repulsive things</b> at the table. Peleimu <b>said to</b> the pauper:

Daf 81b

<b>Sit properly</b> and do not act in a revolting manner. Satan then <b>said to him: Give me a cup. They gave him a cup. He coughed up his phlegm and spat it into</b> the cup. <b>They berated him</b> for acting this way, at which point Satan pretended to <b>sink</b> down <b>and die. They heard</b> people around them <b>saying: Peleimu killed a man! Peleimu killed a man!</b> Peleimu <b>fled and hid himself in the bathroom.</b> Satan <b>followed him</b> and <b>fell before him. Upon seeing that</b> Peleimu <b>was suffering, he revealed himself to him.</b> Satan <b>said to him: What is the reason that you spoke this way,</b> provoking me by saying: An arrow in the eye of Satan? He replied: <b>But what then should I say?</b> Satan <b>said to him: Let the Master,</b> i.e., Peleimu, <b>say:</b> Let <b>the Merciful One rebuke the Satan.</b>
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ashi was accustomed to say, whenever he would fall on his face</b> in prayer: <b>May the Merciful One save us from the evil inclination. One day his wife heard him</b> saying this prayer. <b>She said: After all, it has been several years since he has withdrawn from</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>me</b> due to his advanced years. <b>What is the reason that he says this</b> prayer, as there is no concern that he will engage in sinful sexual behavior?
<b>One day,</b> while <b>he was studying in his garden, she adorned herself and repeatedly walked past him. He said: Who are you? She said: I am Ḥaruta,</b> a well-known prostitute, <b>returning from my day</b> at work. <b>He propositioned her. She said to him: Give me that pomegranate from the top of the tree</b> as payment. <b>He leapt up, went,</b> and <b>brought it to her,</b> and they engaged in intercourse.
<b>When he came home, his wife was lighting</b> a fire in the <b>oven. He went and sat inside it. She said to him: What is this? He said to her: Such and such an incident</b> occurred; he told her that he engaged in intercourse with a prostitute. <b>She said to him: It was I. He paid no attention to her,</b> thinking she was merely trying to comfort him, <b>until she gave him signs</b> that it was indeed she. <b>He said to her: I, in any event, intended to transgress.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>All the days of that righteous man he would fast</b> for the transgression he intended to commit, <b>until he died by that death</b> in his misery.
The Gemara explains the source that one who intended to transgress is punished even though he did not actually sin. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning a husband who nullified the vow of his wife: <b>“Her husband has made them null; and the Lord will forgive her”</b> (Numbers 30:13). <b>With regard to what</b> case <b>is the verse speaking?</b> Why would the woman require forgiveness if her husband has nullified her vow? It is referring <b>to a woman who vowed</b> to <b>be a nazirite, and her husband heard and nullified her</b> vow. <b>And she did not know that her husband had nullified her</b> vow, <b>and she drank wine and contracted impurity from a corpse,</b> violating her presumed vow.
The Gemara relates: <b>When Rabbi Akiva came to this verse he would cry. He said: And if</b> with regard to <b>one who intended to eat pork, and</b> kosher <b>lamb came up in his hand,</b> like this woman who intended to violate her vow but in fact did not, <b>the Torah</b> nevertheless <b>says: She requires atonement and forgiveness, all the more so</b> does <b>one who intended to eat pork and pork came up in his hand</b> require atonement and forgiveness.
<b>In a similar manner, you</b> can <b>say</b> that the same lesson can be derived from the verse: <b>“Though he know it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:17). <b>When Rabbi Akiva came to this verse he would cry.</b> He said: <b>And if</b> with regard to <b>one who intended to eat</b> permitted <b>fat, and</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> mistakenly <b>came up in his hand, the Torah states: “Though he know it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity,” all the more so</b> is this true for <b>one who intended to eat</b> forbidden <b>fat and</b> forbidden <b>fat came up in his hand. Isi ben Yehuda says</b> with regard to the verse <b>“Though he know it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity”: With regard to this matter all sufferers shall grieve,</b> since the verse teaches that one is punished even for sinning unawares.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>a man may be secluded with his mother. Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav Asi says: A man may be secluded with his sister, and live with his mother or with his daughter</b> in a permanent arrangement, without concern. <b>When he said this before Shmuel,</b> the latter <b>said: It is prohibited to be secluded with all those with whom relations are forbidden by the Torah, and even with an animal,</b> as it is prohibited to engage in intercourse with an animal as well.
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>A man may be secluded with his mother, and with his daughter, and sleep alongside them with bodily contact, and</b> this appears to be <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the statement of <b>Shmuel.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Shmuel</b> could have <b>said to you: And according to your reasoning,</b> how should one explain <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>his sister, and his mother-in-law, and all those with whom relations are forbidden,</b> including his mother and daughter, <b>one may be secluded with them only</b> in the presence <b>of witnesses,</b> from which it can be inferred: In the presence <b>of witnesses, yes; without</b> the presence <b>of witnesses, no.</b> This <i>baraita</i> supports the opinion of Shmuel that one may not be secluded with his mother or sister.
<b>Rather,</b> it <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> as to whether one may be secluded with his mother or sister. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Meir said: Be careful with me because of my daughter,</b> i.e., make sure I am not left secluded with her. Similarly, <b>Rabbi Tarfon said: Be careful with me because of my daughter-in-law. A certain student mocked him</b> for being wary of the possibility of sinning with his daughter-in-law. <b>Rabbi Abbahu said in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel: Not many days passed until that student stumbled</b> into sin <b>with his mother-in-law.</b>
The Gemara stated that according to Shmuel it is prohibited for one to be alone <b>even with an animal.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>Abaye removed</b> the animals <b>from the entire field</b> he was in. <b>Rav Sheshet transferred</b> the animals to the other side <b>of the fence. Rav Ḥanan from Neharde’a happened</b> to come <b>to Rav Kahana in Pum Nahara. He saw that</b> he <b>was sitting and studying, and an animal was standing before him.</b> Rav Ḥanan <b>said to him: Doesn’t the Master hold</b> that one may not be secluded <b>even with an animal?</b> Rav Kahana <b>said to him: It</b> did <b>not</b> enter <b>my mind</b> that an animal was before me.
<b>Rava says: A man may be secluded with two sisters-in-law and with two rival wives,</b> i.e., two women who share a husband; <b>with a woman and her mother-in-law;</b> and <b>with a woman and her husband’s daughter.</b> Since these women typically dislike each other, each fears that the other will publicize her sins, and they will be careful not to transgress. Similarly, a man may be secluded <b>with a woman and a girl who knows the meaning of sexual intercourse,</b> i.e., one who is old enough to understand the nature of intercourse, <b>but</b> is still young enough that <b>she does not submit herself to intercourse,</b> since she does not yet desire it. In such a situation, the woman is concerned that the child will reveal her behavior.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>when</b> one’s children <b>have grown up, this one sleeps in his garment</b> and that one sleeps in her garment, but they may share a bed. The Gemara asks: <b>And how</b> old must a child be to be considered grown up for the purposes of this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Adda bar Rav Azza says</b> that <b>Rav Asi says: A girl</b> must reach the <b>age</b> of <b>nine years and one day; a boy</b> must reach the <b>age</b> of <b>twelve years and one day. There are</b> those <b>who say: A girl</b> must reach the <b>age</b> of <b>twelve years and one day; a boy</b> must reach the <b>age</b> of <b>thirteen</b> years <b>and one day. And</b> according to <b>this and that,</b> according to both opinions, the girl is considered a child <b>until</b> she has reached the stage of: <b>“Your breasts were fashioned, and your hair was grown”</b> (Ezekiel 16:7), meaning the onset of puberty.
<b>Rafram bar Pappa says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says: They taught</b> that a man may sleep in close proximity to his minor daughter <b>only if she is not ashamed to stand naked before him, but</b> if she is <b>ashamed to stand naked before him, it is prohibited</b> for him to sleep close to her, regardless of her age. <b>What is the reason?</b> It is that the <b>inclination has a hold upon her,</b> as otherwise she would not be ashamed.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Aḥa bar Abba arrived at the house of Rav Ḥisda, his son-in-law. He took his daughter’s daughter and placed her on his lap.</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: Doesn’t the Master think that she</b> might already be <b>betrothed?</b> Rav Aḥa <b>said to him:</b> If that is true, <b>you have transgressed</b> the ruling <b>of Rav, as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say</b> it was said by <b>Rabbi Elazar: It is prohibited for a man to betroth his daughter when she is a minor, until she grows up and says: I want</b> to marry <b>so-and-so,</b> as otherwise she might reject the designated husband and ultimately sin by committing adultery. Rav Ḥisda replied: <b>The Master has likewise transgressed</b> the words <b>of Shmuel. As Shmuel says: One may not make use of a woman,</b> so how can you hold her on your lap? <b>He said to him: I hold in accordance with another</b> statement <b>of Shmuel, as Shmuel says:</b>

Daf 82a

<b>All</b> such actions <b>are</b> permitted <b>for the sake of Heaven.</b> In other words, if one is acting out of familial affection, without any element of licentiousness, they are permitted.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A bachelor may not act as a teacher of children, nor may a woman act as a teacher of children. Rabbi Elazar says: Even one who does not have a wife may not act as a teacher of children. Rabbi Yehuda says: A bachelor may not herd cattle, nor may two bachelors sleep with one covering,</b> lest they transgress the prohibition against homosexual intercourse, <b>but the Rabbis permit</b> it.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is the reason</b> that a bachelor may not teach children? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>due to the children</b> themselves, that it is suspected that he may engage in homosexual intercourse with them, <b>but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 5:10): <b>They said to Rabbi Yehuda: Jews are not suspected of</b> engaging in <b>homosexual intercourse nor of</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>an animal. Rather,</b> the reason is as follows: <b>A bachelor</b> may not be a teacher of children <b>due to the mothers of the children,</b> who come to the school from time to time, with whom he might sin. Similarly, <b>a woman</b> may not serve as a teacher to children <b>because</b> she may come to be secluded with <b>the fathers of the children.</b>
The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Even one who does not have</b> a wife may not act as a teacher of children. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the students in the study hall: Does Rabbi Elazar mean <b>one who does not have a wife at all, or perhaps</b> he is referring even to one who has a wife, <b>in</b> a circumstance <b>where she is not residing with him? Come</b> and <b>hear: Even one who has</b> a wife <b>but she is not residing with him may not act as a teacher of children.</b> This statement is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Elazar and indicates that his restriction applies even if the man is married.
The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> A bachelor <b>may not herd</b> cattle, nor may two bachelors sleep with one covering. <b>It is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (5:10): <b>They said to Rabbi Yehuda: Jews are not suspected of</b> engaging in <b>homosexual intercourse nor of</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>an animal.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Anyone who has professional dealings</b> primarily <b>with women may not be secluded with women.</b> There is more of a concern that such a man might sin due to his familiarity with the women. <b>And a person may not teach his son a trade</b> that necessitates frequent interaction with <b>women,</b> for the same reason. With regard to teaching one’s son a trade, <b>Rabbi Meir says: A person should always teach his son a clean and easy trade and pray</b> for success <b>to the One to Whom wealth and property belong, as</b> ultimately <b>there is no trade that does not include</b> both <b>poverty and wealth,</b> since a person can become rich from any profession. <b>Poverty does not</b> come <b>from a</b> particular <b>trade, nor does wealth</b> come <b>from a</b> particular <b>trade,</b> but <b>rather, all is in accordance with</b> a person’s <b>merit.</b> Therefore, one should choose a clean and easy trade, and pray to God for success.
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Have you ever seen a beast or a bird that has a trade? And</b> yet <b>they earn their livelihood without anguish. But</b> all these <b>were created only to serve me, and I,</b> a human being, <b>was created to serve</b> the One Who <b>formed me. Is it not right that I should earn my livelihood without anguish? But I,</b> i.e., humanity, <b>have</b> committed <b>evil actions and have lost my livelihood.</b> This is why people must work to earn a living.
<b>Abba Guryan of Tzadyan says in the name of Abba Gurya: A person may not teach his son</b> the trades of <b>a donkey driver, a camel driver, a pot maker, a sailor, a shepherd, or a storekeeper.</b> The reason for all these is the same, <b>as their trades are the trades of robbers;</b> all of these professions involve a measure of dishonesty and are likely to lead to robbery. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says in</b> Abba Gurya’s <b>name: Most donkey drivers are wicked,</b> since they engage in deceit, <b>and most camel drivers,</b> who traverse dangerous places such as deserts, <b>are</b> of <b>fit</b> character, as they pray to God to protect them on their journeys. <b>Most sailors are pious,</b> since the great danger of the seas instills in them the fear of Heaven. <b>The best of doctors is to Gehenna, and</b> even <b>the fittest of butchers is a partner of Amalek.</b>
<b>Rabbi Nehorai says: I set aside all the trades in the world, and I teach my son only Torah, as a person partakes of its reward in this world and the principal</b> reward <b>remains for him in the World-to-Come, which is not true of other professions,</b> whose rewards are only in this world. Furthermore, <b>if a person comes to be ill, or old, or undergoes suffering, and is unable to be involved in his trade, behold, he dies in hunger. But</b> with regard to <b>the Torah it is not so,</b> since one can study it under all circumstances. <b>Rather, it preserves him from all evil</b> and sin <b>in his youth, and provides him with a future and hope in his old age.</b>
The mishna explains: <b>With regard to his youth, what does it say</b> about a Torah scholar? <b>“But they that wait for the Lord shall renew their strength”</b> (Isaiah 40:31). <b>With regard to his old age, what does it say? “They shall still bring forth fruit in old age”</b> (Psalms 92:15), <b>and it likewise states with regard to Abraham our forefather: “And Abraham was old,</b> well stricken in age; <b>and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things”</b> (Genesis 24:1). <b>We found that Abraham our forefather fulfilled the entire Torah before it was given, as it is stated: “Because that Abraham listened to My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws”</b> (Genesis 26:5), which indicates that Abraham observed all the mitzvot of his own accord and was rewarded in his old age as a result.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who has professional dealings</b> primarily <b>with women, his practice</b> and company are <b>bad,</b> and it is best to keep away from him. This category includes, <b>for example, the smiths, and the carders, and the fixers of hand mills</b> of women, <b>and the peddlers</b> of jewelry and perfume to women, <b>and the weavers [<i>gardiyyim</i>], and the barbers, and the launderers, and the bloodletter, and the bathhouse attendant [<i>ballan</i>], and the tanner [<i>burseki</i>]. One may not appoint from</b> among those who have these professions <b>neither a king nor a High Priest. What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>not because they are disqualified,</b> since there is nothing wrong with these jobs, <b>but because their trades are demeaning,</b> and they would not be respected when appointed to a position of authority.
<b>The Sages taught: Ten things were stated with regard to a bloodletter: He walks on his side,</b> i.e., in a haughty manner; <b>and his spirit is arrogant; and he leans and sits,</b> i.e., he does not sit down like others do but leans on an object in a conceited fashion; <b>and he is stingy; and he is envious;</b> and <b>he eats much and discharges</b> only <b>a little; and he is suspected of</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>those with whom relations are forbidden, and of stealing, and of bloodshed</b> in the course of his work.
<b>Bar Kappara taught: A person should always teach his son a clean and easy trade.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> such a profession? <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b>

Daf 82b

<b>Needlework for embroidery</b> is a clean and easy trade.
<b>It is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (5:12): <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: There is no trade that disappears from the world,</b> since all occupations are needed, but <b>fortunate is he who sees his parents in an elevated trade; woe is he who sees his parents in a lowly trade</b> and follows them into their trade. Similarly, <b>it is impossible for the world</b> to continue <b>without a perfumer and without a tanner. Fortunate is he whose trade is</b> as <b>a perfumer, and woe is he whose trade is</b> as <b>a tanner,</b> who works with materials that have a foul smell. Likewise, <b>it is impossible for the world</b> to exist <b>without males and without females,</b> yet <b>fortunate is he whose children are males, and woe is he whose children are females.</b>
<b>Rabbi Meir says: A person should always teach his son a clean and easy trade, and he should request compassion from the One to Whom wealth and property belong, as poverty</b> does <b>not</b> come <b>from a trade, nor</b> does <b>wealth</b> come <b>from a trade; rather,</b> they come <b>from the One to Whom wealth belongs, as it is stated: “Mine is the silver, and Mine the gold, says the Lord of hosts”</b> (Haggai 2:8).
The mishna taught that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Have you ever seen</b> a beast or a bird that has a trade? <b>It is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (5:13): <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: I never saw a deer</b> work as one who <b>dries figs, nor a lion</b> work as <b>a porter, nor a fox</b> work as <b>a storekeeper. And</b> yet <b>they earn their livelihood without anguish. But</b> all these <b>were created only to serve me, and I,</b> a human being, <b>was created to serve</b> the One Who <b>formed me. If these, who were created only to serve me, earn their livelihood without anguish,</b> then <b>is it not right that I, who was created to serve</b> the One Who <b>formed me, should earn my livelihood without anguish? But I,</b> i.e., humanity, <b>have</b> committed <b>evil actions and have lost my livelihood, as it is stated: “Your iniquities have turned away</b> these things, and your sins have held back good from you” (Jeremiah 5:25).
The mishna taught that <b>Rabbi Nehorai says: I set aside all the trades</b> and I teach my son only Torah. It <b>is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (5:14): <b>Rabbi Nehorai says: I set aside all the trades in the world, and I teach my son only Torah, as all other trades serve one only in the days of his youth,</b> when he has enough strength to work, <b>but in the days of his old age, behold, he</b> is left to <b>lie in hunger. But Torah is not like this: It serves a person in the time of his youth and provides him with a future and hope in the time of his old age. With regard to the time of his youth, what does it say</b> about a Torah scholar? <b>“But they that wait for the Lord shall renew their strength”</b> (Isaiah 40:31). <b>With regard to</b> the time of <b>his old age, what does it say? “They shall still bring forth fruit in old age, they shall be full of sap and richness”</b> (Psalms 92:15).
