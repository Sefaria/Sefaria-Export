"It is not fitting for artisans to stand for Torah scholars while they are doing their work".
Is it really not?
But we are taught:
"All the artisans of Jerusalem would stand before them and greet them,
'Our brothers from so-and-so, come in peace!'"
Rabi Yochanan said,
"Before them [the artisans] stand, but not before Torah scholars."
Rabi Yosi bar Avin said,
"Come and see how precious a mitzvah is at its proper time, because [the artisans] stand before them, but not before Torah scholars."
Perhaps there is different because if so [if you would not greet them], you would cause them to stumble [sin] in the future [because they will be discouraged from coming]!

Rav Yehudah said in the name of Shmuel: The verse (Numbers 25, 12) says, “And therefore say, behold I give to him my covenant of peace—shalom.” When he is shalem (whole/complete) and not when he is chaser (missing something/diminished). But hey, the Torah  wrote “shalom”! Said Rav Nachman: The “vav” of shalom is (written) broken.

Every time Rabbi Chiya bar Abba fell upon his face (in the Tachanun prayer) he used to say, ‘The Merciful save me from the Yetzer Ha'Rah. One day his wife overheard him. ‘Let me see,’ she reflected, ‘it is so many years that he has separated from me: why then should he say that?’ One day, while he was studying in his garden, she adorned herself with a scarf and strolled in front of him.  ‘Who are you?’ he asked. ‘I am Cheruta, and have returned today,’ she replied. He desired her. Said she to him, ‘Bring me that pomegranate from the uppermost branch.’ He jumped up, went, and brought it to her. When he re-entered his house, his wife was firing the oven,whereupon he went and sat in it. ‘What is this?’ she asked. He told her what had happened.‘It was I,’ she told him; but he paid no heed to her until she gave him proof. ‘Nevertheless,’ said he, ‘my intention was evil.’ That righteous man fasted all his life, until he died from that very death.
