Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Shammai <b>says:</b> For <b>all women</b> who do not have a fixed menstrual cycle, <b>their time is sufficient.</b> Women who discern that menstrual blood emerged do not need to be concerned that perhaps the flow of blood began before they noticed it. Rather, they assume their ritual impurity status begins at that moment, in terms of rendering impure <i>teruma</i> and ritually pure items with which they come in contact. <b>Hillel says: From examination [<i>mipekida</i>] to examination,</b> i.e., she assumes ritual impurity status retroactive to the last time she examined herself and determined that she was ritually pure, <b>and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if her examination took place <b>several days</b> earlier. Any ritually pure item with which she came in contact in the interim becomes ritually impure.
<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is <b>neither in accordance with the statement of this</b> <i>tanna</i> <b>nor in accordance with the statement of that</b> <i>tanna</i>; <b>rather,</b> the principle is: A twenty-four-hour <b>period reduces</b> the time <b>from examination to examination.</b> In other words, if her final self-examination took place more than twenty-four hours earlier, she need only concern herself with ritual impurity for the twenty-four-hour period prior to discerning the blood. <b>And from examination to examination reduces</b> the time <b>from</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period.</b> In other words, if she examined herself in the course of the previous day and discovered no blood, she was certainly ritually pure prior to the examination.
For <b>any woman who has a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle [<i>veset</i>],</b> and she examined herself at that time and discovered blood, <b>her time is sufficient,</b> and it is only from that time that she transmits ritual impurity. <b>And</b> with regard to a woman <b>who engages in intercourse while</b> using <b>examination cloths [<i>be’edim</i>]</b> before and after intercourse, with which she ascertains whether her menstrual flow began, the halakhic status of such an action <b>is like that of an examination, and</b> therefore <b>it reduces</b> the time <b>from</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period, and</b> reduces the time <b>from examination to examination.</b>
<b>Her time is sufficient, how so?</b> If the woman <b>was sitting in the bed and engaged in</b> handling <b>ritually pure items, and she left</b> the bed <b>and saw</b> blood, <b>she is ritually impure and</b> those items <b>are ritually pure.</b>
<b>Although</b> the Rabbis <b>said</b> that a woman without a fixed menstrual cycle <b>transmits ritual impurity</b> retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period,</b> a woman with a fixed cycle <b>counts</b> her menstrual days <b>only from the moment that she saw</b> blood.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that when a woman discerns that her menstrual blood emerged, Shammai holds that her impurity status starts from that moment, while Hillel maintains that it begins from the time of her most recent self-examination. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Shammai?</b> The Gemara answers: Shammai <b>holds</b> that as there is a principle that when the status of an item is uncertain it retains its presumptive status, here too: <b>Establish</b> the <b>woman in her presumptive status, and a woman remains with the presumptive status of</b> being <b>ritually pure. And</b> what is the reasoning of <b>Hillel?</b> He claims that <b>when</b> one <b>states</b> the principle: <b>Establish an item in its presumptive status,</b> that applies only <b>where there is no weakening</b> in the presumptive status that is a result <b>of</b> the item <b>itself. But</b> in the case of <b>a woman,</b>

Daf 2b

<b>since</b> it is her nature <b>to see</b> blood flow <b>from her body</b> at regular intervals, <b>we do not say: Establish her in her presumptive status</b> of ritual purity. Her body is constantly changing, and therefore she has no such presumptive status.
With regard to the opinions of both Shammai and Hillel, the Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> that of <b>a ritual bath? As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 2:2): In the case of <b>a ritual bath</b> that was known to have contained the requisite forty <i>se’a</i>, <b>which was</b> then <b>measured and found lacking</b> in its quantity of water, <b>all pure items that had been rendered</b> pure <b>in it,</b> i.e., any impure items that had been purified through immersion in this ritual bath, <b>retroactive</b> to when the ritual bath was last measured, <b>whether</b> this ritual bath is found <b>in the private domain or in the public domain, are impure.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Shammai,</b> the mishna poses <b>a difficulty from</b> its statement that the change in the ritual bath’s status is assumed <b>retroactive</b> to the time when it was last measured, as he maintains that a menstruating woman’s status changes only at the present moment, not retroactive to the last time she examined herself.
<b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Hillel,</b> the mishna also poses <b>a difficulty</b> with regard to its ruling that the items purified in the ritual bath are deemed impure with <b>certainty, whereas</b> a menstruating women does not assume retroactive impurity with certainty. In other words, although according to the Rabbis there is a twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> of retroactive ritual impurity in the case <b>of a menstruating woman,</b> and according to Hillel the retroactive impurity extends back to her most recent examination, nevertheless any <i>teruma</i> that she touched during that period is not deemed definitely impure to the extent that it must be burned. Rather, the impure status of the items she touched is uncertain and the status of the <i>teruma</i> is <b>suspended,</b> i.e., one may <b>neither eat</b> it <b>nor burn</b> it. <b>Whereas here,</b> in the case of the ritual bath, any item purified in it is retroactively deemed <b>definitely impure.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of a ritual bath, it is different, <b>since it can be said: Establish</b> the <b>impure</b> item <b>in its presumptive status and say</b> that <b>it was not</b> properly <b>immersed.</b> In other words, the presumptive status of the item as ritually impure is in keeping with the current deficient state of the ritual bath. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>On the contrary,</b> one should <b>establish the ritual bath in its presumptive state</b> of validity <b>and say that</b> the ritual bath <b>was not</b> previously <b>lacking</b> the requisite measure of water. The Gemara responds: There is no presumptive state of validity, as the ritual bath <b>is lacking before you,</b> i.e., at present, and this offsets the presumptive status that it was full.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Here too,</b> in the case of a menstruating woman, she is one who has experienced a discharge of <b>blood before you,</b> i.e., at present. Just as the ritual bath’s presumptive status of validity is offset by its present lack of the requisite measure of water, so too the woman’s previous presumptive status of ritual purity is offset by her present state of impurity due to menstruation. The Gemara answers: In the case of the menstruating woman, it is possible that <b>it is</b> only <b>now that she saw</b> the first emission of her menstrual blood. The Gemara retorts: One can say the same with regard to the ritual bath: <b>Here too, it is</b> only <b>now that</b> it <b>became lacking</b> in the requisite measure of water.
The Gemara answers: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in the case of the ritual bath, <b>it can be said</b> that the water slowly trickled out and consequently the amount of water was <b>continuously diminishing.</b> Therefore, it is possible that the ritual bath lost its valid status long ago without anyone realizing. By contrast, <b>here,</b> with regard to a menstruating woman, <b>can it be said</b> that she was <b>continuously seeing</b> menstrual blood? The Gemara responds: <b>And what is the difficulty?</b> The same possibility does in fact exist in the case of a menstruating woman, as <b>perhaps she saw</b> the blood depart <b>bit [<i>hagas</i>] by bit.</b>
The Gemara states a different answer: <b>There,</b> in the case of the ritual bath, <b>there are two</b> factors <b>that weaken</b> the suggestion that the items are ritually pure: First, the ritual bath is lacking at present; second, the item has a presumptive status of impurity. <b>Here,</b> by contrast, <b>there is</b> only <b>one</b> factor <b>that weakens</b> the possibility that the items touched by the currently menstruating woman were rendered ritually impure, i.e., that she is currently experiencing a menstrual flow. Therefore, according to Shammai she assumes impurity status only from that moment onward, and according to Hillel her retroactive impurity status applies only as an uncertainty.
§ The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to Shammai, who holds that her time is sufficient and there is no retroactive impurity, <b>what is different</b> in the case <b>of a barrel? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Terumot</i> 2:8): If someone <b>would inspect</b> the contents of <b>a barrel</b> to see if it still contained enough wine <b>to continually</b> mentally <b>separate <i>teruma</i> from it,</b> i.e., to exempt other untithed wine of his until all the wine in this barrel will be <i>teruma</i>, <b>and afterward</b> the contents of the barrel <b>were found</b> to have turned to <b>vinegar,</b> which cannot be set aside as <i>teruma</i> for untithed wine, then for <b>all of the first three days</b> following his most recent inspection, it is <b>definitely</b> considered to have been wine. Therefore, any of the untithed wine for which <i>teruma</i> was separated during those days is tithed.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>From that</b> point <b>forward,</b> i.e., more than three days after the most recent inspection, it is <b>uncertain</b> whether it had already turned to vinegar, and consequently any untithed wine for which <i>teruma</i> was separated during those days remains uncertainly tithed. This poses <b>a difficulty for Shammai,</b> who maintains that there is no such retroactive consideration in the case of a menstruating woman.
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of the barrel, it is different, <b>since it can be said: Establish the untithed produce in its presumptive status,</b> as when it first grew it was definitely untithed, <b>and say</b> it was <b>not amended,</b> i.e., exempted, and its status continues to be untithed produce. The Gemara asks: <b>On the contrary,</b> one should <b>establish the wine in its presumptive status, and say</b> that it had <b>not turned to vinegar.</b>
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: This is impossible, as <b>it is turned to vinegar before you,</b> i.e., at present. The Gemara replies: <b>Here too,</b> in the case of a menstruating woman, one who has experienced a discharge of <b>blood</b> is <b>before you,</b> at present, so what is the difference? The Gemara explains: With regard to the woman, it is possible that <b>it is</b> only <b>now that she saw</b> the beginning of her menstrual blood. The Gemara responds: <b>There too,</b> it is possible that <b>it is</b> only <b>now that it turned to vinegar,</b> but not earlier.
The Gemara again answers: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in the case of the wine, <b>it can be said</b> that it was <b>continuously turning to vinegar.</b> Therefore, it is possible that the wine turned to vinegar much earlier without anyone realizing. By contrast, in the case of the menstruating woman, <b>can it be said</b> that she was <b>continuously seeing</b> menstrual blood? Once again, the Gemara responds: <b>And what is the difficulty?</b> The same possibility does in fact exist in the case of a menstruating woman, as <b>perhaps she saw</b> the blood depart <b>bit by bit.</b>
The Gemara provides a different answer: <b>There,</b> in the case of the barrel, there are <b>two</b> factors <b>that weaken</b> the suggestion that the wine is tithed: First, it is vinegar at present; second, the wine has a presumptive status that it is untithed. <b>Here,</b> by contrast, <b>there is</b> only <b>one</b> factor <b>that weakens</b> the possibility that the items touched by the menstruating woman were rendered ritually impure, i.e., that she is currently experiencing a menstrual flow.
§ <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction between</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>barrel</b> and that <b>of</b> the <b>ritual bath: What is different here,</b> in the case of the ritual bath, where the items are <b>definitely</b> impure, <b>and what is different there,</b> with regard to the barrel, where it is only <b>uncertain</b> that the produce remains untithed? In both cases the current situation, that the ritual bath is deficient and the contents of the barrel have turned to vinegar, should lead to a definite status.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina of Sura says: Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>barrel? It is Rabbi Shimon, who, with regard to a ritual bath also considers it</b> as a matter of <b>uncertainty,</b> rather than as definitely impure. Therefore, there is no contradiction between the two <i>halakhot</i>.
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 2:2): In the case of <b>a ritual bath</b> that was known to have contained the requisite forty <i>se’a</i>, <b>which was</b> then <b>measured and found lacking</b> in its quantity of water, <b>all pure items that had been rendered</b> pure <b>in it,</b> i.e., any impure items that had been purified through immersion in this ritual bath, <b>retroactive</b> to when the ritual bath was last measured, <b>whether</b> this ritual bath is located <b>in the private domain or in the public domain, are impure.</b>
The mishna continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> If the impure items were immersed in a ritual bath that was <b>in the public domain,</b> they are deemed <b>pure.</b> But if they were immersed in a ritual bath that was <b>in a private domain,</b> the status of any <i>teruma</i> that touched them is <b>suspended,</b> i.e., it is neither consumed nor burned. Rabbi Shimon holds that even in the case of a ritual bath, the items are not retroactively deemed definitely impure. Rather the status is uncertain, just as in the case of the barrel.

Daf 3a

The Gemara explains their reasoning: <b>And both</b> <i>tanna’im</i> <b>derived</b> their respective opinions <b>only from</b> the case of <b>a woman suspected by her husband of having been unfaithful [<i>sota</i>],</b> who is forbidden to engage in intercourse with her husband just like a definite adulteress.
<b>The Rabbis hold:</b> This case of a ritual bath is <b>like</b> the case of <b>a <i>sota</i>. Just as</b> in the case of <b>a <i>sota</i></b> it is <b>uncertain</b> whether <b>she</b> was actually unfaithful, <b>and</b> nevertheless the Torah <b>rendered her like</b> one who <b>definitely</b> committed adultery in that she is forbidden to her husband until she drinks the water of a <i>sota</i>; <b>here too,</b> in the case of a ritual bath, it is <b>uncertain</b> whether it was lacking the requisite measure of water <b>and</b> yet the Torah <b>rendered it as</b> though it was <b>definitely</b> lacking water, to the extent that <i>teruma</i> that touched an item that had been immersed in it must be burned.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the ritual bath are derived <b>from</b> those of <b>a <i>sota</i>,</b> then one can <b>say</b> that it should be <b>like</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a <b><i>sota</i></b> in another respect: <b>Just as a <i>sota</i></b> who is suspected of having been unfaithful <b>in a public domain</b> is considered <b>pure,</b> i.e., she does not undergo to rite of a <i>sota</i>, <b>here too,</b> any impure item that was immersed in a currently deficient ritual bath that is situated <b>in a public domain</b> should be considered <b>pure.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared?</b> One cannot apply the <i>halakha</i> of a <i>sota</i> in a public domain to any other case. <b>There,</b> the reason why a <i>sota</i> is treated as having definitely been unfaithful is <b>due to</b> her <b>seclusion</b> with another man. <b>And</b> as a proper <b>seclusion in the public domain is not</b> possible, she does not assume the status of a <i>sota</i>. By contrast, <b>here,</b> in the case of the ritual bath, the uncertainty <b>is due to</b> the <b>lack</b> of the requisite measure of water in the ritual bath. If so, <b>what</b> difference is it <b>to me</b> if the ritual bath is <b>lacking in a public domain</b> or if it is <b>lacking in a private domain?</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And if you would say</b> that the guiding principle in <b>any</b> case of <b>uncertainty</b> involving <b>impurity in a public domain</b> is that it is <b>ritually pure,</b> and therefore all items immersed in a ritual bath situated in the public domain should be pure even if there is uncertainty about its status of purity, that suggestion can be rejected, as follows: <b>Since there are two</b> factors <b>that weaken</b> the possibility that the items are ritually pure: First, the ritual bath is currently lacking, and second, the item has a presumptive status of impurity, it is therefore <b>considered as</b> an item of <b>definite impurity.</b>
After analyzing the reasoning of the Rabbis, the Gemara turns to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. <b>And Rabbi Shimon holds:</b> This case of a ritual bath is just <b>like</b> the case of <b>a <i>sota</i>. Just as a <i>sota</i></b> who is suspected of having been unfaithful <b>in a public domain</b> is considered <b>pure, here too,</b> any impure item that was immersed in a currently deficient ritual bath that is situated <b>in a public domain</b> is considered <b>pure.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the ritual bath are derived <b>from</b> those of <b>a <i>sota</i>,</b> then one can <b>say</b> that it should be <b>like</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a <b><i>sota</i></b> in another respect: <b>Just as a <i>sota</i></b> who secluded herself with the man <b>in a private domain</b> is deemed <b>definitely impure,</b> i.e., she is forbidden to her husband until she undergoes the rite of the <i>sota</i>, <b>here too,</b> any ritually impure item that was immersed in a currently deficient ritual bath situated <b>in a private domain</b> should be considered <b>definitely impure.</b> If so, any <i>teruma</i> that comes in contact with the immersed vessel should be burned. Why, then, does Rabbi Shimon rule that its status is suspended and it is neither consumed nor burned?
The Gemara answers: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in the case of a <i>sota</i>, <b>there is a basis for the matter.</b> She is considered definitely impure, <b>as</b> her husband <b>issued a warning to her</b> about this particular man <b>and she</b> then <b>secluded</b> herself with him. By contrast, <b>here,</b> in the case of a ritual bath, <b>what basis for the matter is there?</b> Why should one assume impurity with certainty?
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>this is</b> the <b>reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon:</b> He does not base his ruling on the case of a <i>sota</i>; rather, he <b>derives the end of impurity from the beginning of impurity,</b> i.e., he derives the <i>halakha</i> of the immersion of an impure item into a ritual bath from the <i>halakha</i> of the initial contraction of ritual impurity.
The Gemara explains: <b>Just as</b> with regard to the <b>beginning of impurity,</b> if there is <b>uncertainty whether or not</b> a pure item <b>came into contact</b> with a source of impurity, if this occurred <b>in the public domain</b> it is considered ritually <b>pure; so too</b> in the case of the <b>end of impurity,</b> if there is <b>uncertainty whether or not</b> the impure item was <b>immersed</b> in a ritual bath with the requisite amount of water, the <i>halakha</i> is that if the ritual bath is located <b>in the public domain,</b> the item is considered <b>pure.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how would <b>the Rabbis</b> respond to this claim? They would respond: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> with regard to the beginning of impurity, <b>the man</b> who might have touched an impure item <b>remains with the presumptive status</b> of <b>ritual purity.</b> Consequently, <b>we do not lower his</b> status to one who has contracted <b>ritual impurity</b> merely <b>due to uncertainty. Here,</b> in the case of the ritual bath, <b>the man</b> who immerses in that ritual bath <b>has the presumptive status</b> of <b>ritual impurity.</b> Therefore, <b>we do not remove him</b> from <b>his</b> status <b>of ritual impurity due to uncertainty.</b>
§ The Gemara returns to its analysis of the mishna. Shammai said: For all women, their time is sufficient, i.e., women who discern that menstrual blood emerged do not need to be concerned that perhaps the flow of blood began before they noticed it. The Gemara asks: In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> that of <b>an alleyway? As we learned</b> in a mishna (66a): With regard to the carcass of <b>a creeping animal that is found in an alleyway,</b> it <b>renders</b> any item in the alleyway <b>ritually impure retroactively to</b> the time <b>that</b> a person can <b>say: I examined this alleyway and there was no</b> carcass of <b>a creeping animal in it, or until the time of the</b> last <b>sweeping</b> of the alleyway.
The Gemara answers: <b>There too,</b> one can explain: <b>Since there</b> are two types of carcasses of creeping animals that are likely to be found in the alleyway, <b>creeping animals from</b> the alleyway <b>itself and creeping animals that came from the world</b> at large, <b>it is compared to</b> a case where there <b>are two</b> factors <b>that weaken</b> the possibility that the items are ritually pure. Therefore, even Shammai agrees that in such a case the impurity extends retroactively back in time.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>this is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Shammai: Since a women senses within herself</b> if she is experiencing a flow of blood, if she felt the flow only at present, it is certain that she did not experience a flow previously. <b>And Hillel</b> holds that she might have experienced a flow earlier while she was urinating and <b>she thought it</b> was all <b>the sensation of</b> her flow of <b>urine.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Shammai, isn’t there</b> the case of <b>a sleeping</b> woman, who would not sense her flow of menstrual blood? The Gemara answers: <b>A sleeping</b> woman would <b>also</b> sense her flow, and <b>due to her discomfort</b> she <b>would awaken, just as it is with the sensation</b> of the need to <b>urinate.</b>
The Gemara raises another difficulty with regard to the opinion of Shammai: <b>But there</b> is the case of <b>a mentally incompetent</b> woman, who does not properly understand what she is sensing. She might have previously experienced a flow of menstrual blood that she did not notice. The Gemara answers: <b>Shammai concedes</b> in the case <b>of a mentally incompetent</b> woman that she is impure retroactively. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the mishna explicitly <b>teaches</b> that Shammai mentioned <b>all women,</b> which apparently includes even the mentally incompetent. The Gemara answers: When the mishna teaches: <b>All women,</b> it is referring to all <b>mentally competent</b> women.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> that Shammai’s opinion applies to: <b>Women,</b> rather than referring to all women. The Gemara answers: The inclusive statement: All women, serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer. As Rabbi Eliezer said</b> in a mishna (7a): There are <b>four women</b> with regard to whom the <i>halakha</i> is that their time is sufficient. This indicates that there are only four, <b>and no more.</b> Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us: All women,</b> to include all mentally competent women, not only the four mentioned by Rabbi Eliezer.
The Gemara raises yet another difficulty against the opinion of Shammai: <b>But there is</b> the case of blood <b>stains.</b> The mishna teaches (66a) that a woman who finds a blood stain is impure retroactive to the last time she examined her clothing and found them clean. <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>we learned</b> the mishna with regard to <b>stains not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shammai? Abaye said: Shammai concedes</b> in the case <b>of stains.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason?</b> The reason is <b>that she neither engaged in</b> handling a slaughtered <b>bird nor</b> did <b>she pass through a marketplace of butchers.</b> If so, <b>from where</b> could <b>this blood</b> stain on her clothing have <b>come?</b> Since it must be from her last menstrual flow, Shammai agrees that she is impure retroactively.
The Gemara suggests another analysis: <b>Or if you wish, say</b> that <b>this is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Shammai:</b> She is impure only from that point onward, <b>as, if it is so that there was</b> any menstrual <b>blood</b> previously, <b>it would have come</b> out <b>at the outset,</b> i.e., at the earlier time. The Gemara explains why Hillel maintains that there is ritual impurity retroactively, in light of this analysis: <b>And</b> as for <b>Hillel,</b> he holds that the <b>walls of the womb,</b> i.e., the walls of the vaginal canal, <b>held back</b> the menstrual blood from leaving the body entirely, and therefore there might have been a previous emission from the uterus into the vaginal canal that was not visible on the outside. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Shammai</b> respond to this claim? The Gemara answers: Shammai maintains that the <b>walls of the womb do not hold back blood.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to</b> a woman who <b>engages in intercourse</b> while using a contraceptive absorbent <b>cloth</b> in the form of a wad that she inserts in her vagina at the opening of her womb so as not to become pregnant, <b>what is there to say?</b> In other words, how does Shammai explain why there is no retroactive impurity status in such a case, as it cannot be claimed that any previous menstrual blood would have flowed out earlier. <b>Abaye says: Shammai concedes with regard to</b> a woman who <b>engages in intercourse</b> while using a contraceptive <b>cloth</b> that she is impure retroactively.
<b>Rava says:</b> Here <b>as well,</b> in a case where a woman engages in intercourse while using a contraceptive absorbent <b>cloth,</b> any previous menstrual blood would have flowed out, as the absorbent cloth does not hermetically seal the womb. The reason is that the cloth <b>wrinkles due to perspiration,</b> leaving space for blood to pass through. The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> nevertheless <b>Rava concedes</b> to Abaye that Shammai agrees that she is retroactively impure in a case <b>where</b> a woman engages in intercourse while using a tightly <b>packed</b> absorbent <b>cloth.</b>
§ The Gemara suggested that the reasoning for Shammai’s opinion is that the woman would have felt any previous menstrual flow, or that any prior menstrual blood would have flowed out previously. Yet, earlier the Gemara suggested that his reason was that the woman retains her presumptive status of ritual purity. With regard to the explanations given for the opinion of Shammai, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> difference <b>is there between these versions and that version</b> suggested earlier?

Daf 3b

The Gemara answers: The difference <b>between</b> them is with regard to the possibility <b>of raising a contradiction</b> between Shammai’s ruling here and the cases of <b>a barrel, a ritual bath, and an alleyway. According to that version,</b> that Shammai’s reasoning is based upon the principle that an item retains its presumptive status, <b>there is</b> room <b>to raise these contradictions,</b> as the Gemara explained. By contrast, <b>according to these</b> other <b>versions,</b> that the woman would have felt any previous menstrual flow or that any prior menstrual blood would have flowed out previously, <b>there is no</b> room <b>to raise</b> such <b>contradictions,</b> as those rulings do not contradict the <i>halakha</i> here, where a unique factor is relevant.
The Gemara further asks: <b>And what</b> difference <b>is there between this version,</b> that any prior menstrual blood would have flowed out, <b>and that version,</b> that she would have felt any previous menstrual flow? The Gemara answers: <b>According to Abaye,</b> who maintains that Shammai agrees that a woman who engages in intercourse while using a contraceptive cloth is impure retroactively, <b>there is</b> a difference in a case where the woman engages in intercourse while using a contraceptive <b>cloth.</b> If Shammai’s reasoning is that a woman senses the emission of blood, in this case too it is assumed that she did not emit blood earlier. By contrast, if his reasoning is that any prior menstrual blood would have come out at the outset, it is possible that the cloth blocked the emission of blood, and she already emitted blood. Consequently, she is impure retroactively.
<b>According to Rava,</b> who maintains that blood can emerge even if the woman engages in intercourse while using a contraceptive absorbent cloth, <b>there is</b> a difference between the two interpretations in a case where she engages in intercourse while using a tightly <b>packed</b> absorbent <b>cloth,</b> as such a cloth will prevent the blood from flowing out, but it does not affect her ability to sense an emission.
It is <b>taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 4:4) <b>in accordance with this version,</b> i.e., that Shammai’s reasoning is <b>that if it is so, that there was</b> menstrual <b>blood</b> previously, <b>it would have come</b> out <b>at the outset: Hillel said to Shammai: Don’t you concede</b> to the following <i>halakha</i>: In the case <b>of a basket</b> that <b>was used</b> as a container for <b>ritually pure</b> items, and those items were placed <b>in</b> one <b>corner, and</b> subsequently the carcass of <b>a creeping animal was found in a different corner</b> of the basket, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that the</b> items <b>initially</b> considered <b>ritually pure</b> are now retroactively considered <b>impure? Shammai said to him: Indeed,</b> that is correct.
Hillel continues: <b>And</b> if so, <b>what difference</b> is there between <b>this</b> case of the pure items stored in the basket, which are now considered retroactively impure, <b>and that</b> case of the ritually pure woman who experiences a menstrual flow, who is impure only from that point onward? Shammai answers: <b>This</b> one, the basket, <b>has a base</b> on which it rests, and therefore the creeping animal might have been there earlier unseen. <b>That one,</b> the menstruating woman, <b>has no base,</b> i.e., there is nothing to impede her menstrual blood from flowing out. Shammai’s response indicates that she is not retroactively impure because if she had experienced a previous menstruation it would have flowed at that stage.
§ <b>Rava says:</b> The <b>reason for</b> the opinion of <b>Shammai</b> that a woman who experiences menstruation is not deemed ritually impure retroactively is <b>due to the dereliction of</b> the mitzva to <b>be fruitful and multiply.</b> If woman is always deemed retroactively impure, she and her husband might abstain from engaging in sexual intercourse out of fear that she is already impure even if she has not yet experienced bleeding. The Gemara adds <b>that this</b> explanation <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Shammai said to Hillel: If</b> it is <b>so,</b> that a woman is rendered retroactively impure as you claim, <b>you</b> will <b>have caused the Jewish women to be derelict in</b> the mitzva to <b>be fruitful and multiply.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to <b>the one who taught this version,</b> i.e., Rava, there is a difficulty: <b>Isn’t it taught in</b> the aforementioned mishna <b>in accordance with that</b> other <b>version,</b> that Shammai’s reasoning is <b>that if it is so, that there was</b> any menstrual <b>blood</b> previously, <b>it would have come</b> out <b>at the outset?</b> The Gemara answers: There, in that mishna, <b>it is Hillel who erred. He thought</b> the <b>reason</b> of <b>Shammai</b> is <b>that if it is so, that there was</b> any menstrual <b>blood</b> previously, <b>it would have come</b> out <b>at the outset. And</b> therefore, <b>he raises a difficulty</b> against Shammai’s opinion from the case of the <b>basket.</b>
<b>And Shammai said to</b> Hillel: You are mistaken. <b>My reasoning</b> is actually <b>due to the dereliction of</b> the mitzva to <b>be fruitful and multiply. But even according to your erroneous</b> reasoning <b>that</b> led <b>you to raise a difficulty</b> from the case of the <b>basket,</b> I have an answer for that as well: <b>This</b> basket <b>has a base,</b> and therefore the creeping animal could have been there earlier, unseen; <b>but that</b> menstruating woman <b>has no base.</b>
The Gemara asks the reverse question: <b>And according to the one</b> who <b>teaches this</b> other <b>version,</b> that Shammai’s reasoning is that if there was previous menstrual blood it would have come out at the outset, <b>isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with that</b> other <b>version,</b> that Shammai’s reasoning is <b>due to the dereliction of</b> the mitzva to <b>be fruitful and multiply?</b>
The Gemara answers: That <i>baraita</i> was recorded at a later point in their discussion, as <b>this</b> is what <b>Hillel is saying to Shammai: Yes,</b> the <b>reason</b> that <b>you say</b> for your opinion has merit, <b>that if it is so, that there was</b> any menstrual <b>blood</b> previously, <b>it would have come</b> out <b>at the outset. Nevertheless,</b> you should <b>enact a safeguard for your statement</b> and render her retroactively impure, <b>as</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from the rest of the entire Torah, where</b> the Sages <b>enact safeguards?</b>
Shammai <b>said to</b> Hillel: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if she is considered impure retroactively as a safeguard, <b>you</b> will <b>have caused the Jewish women to be derelict in</b> the mitzva to <b>be fruitful and multiply.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Hillel</b> respond to Shammai’s reasoning with regard to the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply? The Gemara explains that Hillel would answer: Although I rule that she is retroactively impure, <b>did I say</b> that she is forbidden to her husband and must therefore abstain <b>from</b> the mitzva to <b>be fruitful and multiply? I said</b> only <b>that</b> she renders impure any <b>ritually pure</b> items that she touched.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how would <b>Shammai</b> reply to this? The Gemara answers: Shammai maintains that <b>even</b> a safeguard that renders <b>ritually pure</b> items impure should <b>not</b> be imposed. The reason is <b>that if</b> it were <b>so,</b> the <b>heart</b> of a scrupulous husband might <b>strike him</b> with pangs of conscience over sins that he could transgress <b>and he</b> would <b>separate</b> from his wife, out of fear that she is impure.
The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the ensuing discussions: <b>A base; examined; covered; in a corner.</b> It <b>was stated:</b> If one has <b>a basket</b> that <b>was used</b> as a container for holding <b>ritually pure</b> produce, and those items were placed <b>in</b> one <b>corner</b> of the basket, <b>and</b> subsequently the carcass of <b>a creeping animal was found in a different corner</b> of the basket, <b>Ḥizkiyya says:</b> That produce <b>initially</b> considered <b>ritually pure</b> is still <b>pure. Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The produce <b>initially</b> considered <b>ritually pure</b> is now retroactively deemed <b>impure.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> how can Ḥizkiyya rule that it is pure? After all, don’t <b>Shammai and Hillel agree in</b> the case of the <b>basket that</b> the produce <b>initially</b> considered <b>pure</b> is now retroactively <b>impure?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> do <b>Shammai and Hillel agree</b> that all the produce is retroactively impure? <b>With regard to a basket that has a base.</b> In such a case, the carcass of the creeping animal might have previously been in the basket and it went unnoticed when one removed the pure produce items. <b>When Ḥizkiyya and Rabbi Yoḥanan disagree,</b> it is <b>with regard to a basket that has no base,</b> i.e., both ends were open and the basket was used while it was lying on its side. In that situation, the contents of the basket are emptied by raising one end, which causes all items inside to fall out. Consequently, any creeping animal that was found subsequently must have entered the basket only after that produce was removed, which is why Ḥizkiyya rules that the produce remains pure.
The Gemara asks: If this is referring to a case where the basket <b>has no base, what is the reasoning of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> for ruling that the produce is ritually impure? The Gemara answers: The basket <b>has no base but it</b> does <b>have</b> an inward-curved <b>rim.</b> Therefore, it is possible that the carcass of a small creeping animal might have been held back by the rim and remained inside the basket even after it was turned over. Rabbi Yoḥanan rules that the produce is retroactively impure, due to the possibility that the creeping animal might have been in the basket previously together with the initially pure produce.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who draws ten pails of water one after another,</b> i.e., he draws out water in one pail and from it he fills another ten pails with water, <b>and</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal is found in one of them, that</b> pail of water <b>is ritually impure but all</b> the rest <b>of them</b> are <b>pure. And Reish Lakish says in the name of Rabbi Yannai:</b> This <i>halakha</i> was <b>taught only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the pail <b>has no</b> inward-curved <b>rim.</b> Consequently, its contents are entirely emptied each time it is overturned, which means that the creeping animal must have entered only this pail. <b>But</b> if the pail <b>has a rim, all of</b> the water that had been drawn is <b>impure,</b> as the creeping animal might have entered the pail earlier and the rim held it back each time the pail was overturned.
The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>Ḥizkiyya,</b> who is not concerned that the rim of the basket might have held back the creeping animal, does <b>not agree</b> with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yannai?</b> The Gemara answers that there is a difference between the two cases: <b>Water is slippery,</b> whereas <b>produce is not slippery.</b> In order to pour water out of the pail it is not necessary to turn it over completely. Therefore, the rim might hold back a creeping animal. By contrast, a basket must have one end fully raised in order to empty out all the produce it contains. In such a case Rabbi Yannai would agree that nothing could have been held back, and therefore the emptied produce remains pure.
Alternatively, there is a different reason why one does not overturn a pail of water entirely: In the case of <b>water, one is not particular about it,</b> i.e., he does not mind if some is left over. Therefore he does not overturn the pail completely. By contrast, in the case of <b>produce one is particular about it,</b> so he raises one end of the basket entirely to ensure that every last piece of produce is emptied. Consequently, in the case of produce Rabbi Yannai would agree that even if the basket has a rim, all the produce remains pure.
As an alternative to its previous resolution that Ḥizkiyya is discussing the case of a rimmed receptacle, the Gemara suggests another resolution of the apparent contradiction between Ḥizkiyya’s ruling and the opinions of Hillel and Shammai. <b>And if you wish, say: When</b> do <b>Shammai and Hillel agree? In</b> the case of <b>a basket that was not examined.</b> Since he did not examine the basket when he placed the pure produce there, a creeping animal might have already been inside. Consequently, they agree that the produce does not retain its presumptive state of purity but is considered retroactively impure.

Daf 4a

<b>When Ḥizkiyya and Rabbi Yoḥanan disagree,</b> it is <b>with regard to a basket</b> that was <b>examined.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Ḥizkiyya, <b>holds</b> that <b>since</b> it <b>was examined</b> before the produce was placed inside and was found to be clean of creeping animals, it is reasonable to assume that the creeping animal entered only after the ritually pure produce was removed. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that one can <b>say</b> that it is possible that <b>when he removed his hand</b> after feeling around to examine the basket, the creeping animal <b>fell</b> in.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> the case of a basket <b>taught</b> as being <b>similar to</b> the case of a menstruating <b>woman?</b> Hillel had cited the case of the basket as a difficulty with regard to Shammai’s opinion in the case of a menstruating woman. <b>And</b> since <b>a woman is</b> considered fully <b>examined,</b> since she examines herself with examination cloths twice a day, the other case must also be referring to a basket that had been examined. The Gemara answers: <b>Since blood is commonly found</b> flowing from <b>her,</b> as women regularly experience menstrual flows, it is <b>considered as</b> though she were <b>not examined.</b>
The Gemara suggests another resolution of the apparent contradiction between the ruling of Ḥizkiyya and the opinions of Hillel and Shammai. <b>And if you wish, say: When Shammai and Hillel agree,</b> it is <b>with regard to a basket that is not covered. When</b> do <b>Ḥizkiyya and Rabbi Yoḥanan disagree? With regard to a basket</b> that is <b>covered.</b> The Gemara asks: If the basket <b>is covered, how did</b> the creeping animal <b>fall</b> inside? The Gemara answers: <b>For example, if</b> the basket <b>is used by</b> removing its <b>lid.</b> Ḥizkiyya holds that the creeping animal must have fallen in after the produce was removed, because as long as the produce was inside one would be careful not to allow anything else inside. Rabbi Yoḥanan is concerned that perhaps while the basket was uncovered a creeping animal could have fallen inside without one noticing.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: But <b>isn’t</b> the case of a basket <b>taught</b> as being <b>similar to</b> the case of a menstruating <b>woman? And</b> just as a woman <b>is considered covered,</b> since no outside blood can enter her, so too in the case of a basket, it must be one where it is constantly covered. The Gemara explains: <b>Since blood is commonly found</b> flowing from <b>her,</b> as women regularly experience menstrual flows, it is <b>considered as</b> though she is <b>not</b> always <b>covered.</b>
The Gemara suggests another resolution. <b>And if you wish, say: When</b> do <b>Shammai and Hillel agree?</b> In a case where the produce was stored <b>in</b> the <b>corner</b> of <b>a basket.</b> By contrast, <b>when Ḥizkiyya and Rabbi Yoḥanan disagree,</b> it is in a case where the produce was stored <b>in</b> the <b>corner</b> of <b>a house.</b> The Gemara expresses puzzlement at this suggestion: <b>But</b> the Gemara on 3b explicitly <b>states</b> that they are referring to a case of <b>a basket.</b>
The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what the Gemara on 3b <b>is saying:</b> If one has <b>a basket that was used</b> as a container for <b>ritually pure</b> produce <b>in this corner</b> of the <b>house, and</b> after the produce was removed <b>it was</b> subsequently <b>carried to another corner, and</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal was found</b> in the basket while it was <b>in</b> that <b>other corner, Ḥizkiyya holds:</b> The produce remains ritually pure, as <b>we do not presume</b> that <b>ritual impurity</b> moved <b>from place to place.</b> In other words, the impure creeping animal is not assumed to have moved from the first corner where the produce was kept. Instead, it fell inside while the basket was in the second corner, and therefore the produce that it previously contained remains pure. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan holds:</b> The produce is retroactively considered impure, as <b>we</b> do <b>presume</b> that ritual impurity, i.e., the carcass of the creeping animal in the basket, moved from place to place.
The Gemara asks a question with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>And do we presume</b> that ritual impurity moved from place to place? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 5:7): If someone <b>touched one</b> other person <b>at night, and he does not know whether</b> the person he touched was <b>alive or dead, and on the following day he arose and found him dead,</b> and he is uncertain whether or not he contracted ritual impurity from contact with a corpse, <b>Rabbi Meir deems him</b> ritually <b>pure.</b> It is assumed that the deceased was still alive until the point that it is known with certainty that he was dead.
<b>And the Rabbis deem him</b> ritually <b>impure, as</b> it is presumed that <b>all</b> ritually <b>impure</b> items had already been in the same state as they were <b>at the time they were discovered.</b> Just as the deceased was found dead in the morning, so too, it is presumed that he was dead when he was touched in the middle of the night.
The Gemara concludes its question: <b>And it is taught with regard to</b> this mishna: It is presumed that ritually impure items had been in the same state as they were <b>at the time they were discovered, but</b> only <b>in the place</b> in which <b>they were discovered.</b> In other words, if the corpse had been found in a different spot than he was at night, it is not presumed that he was already dead in the first spot, and the man who touched him remains ritually pure. If so, how can Rabbi Yoḥanan maintain that we presume impurity moved from place to place?
<b>And if you would say</b> in response: <b>This statement,</b> that impurity is presumed only in the place in which it was discovered, applies specifically with regard to definite impure status, i.e., <b>to burn</b> <i>teruma</i>, <b>but</b> with regard to uncertain impurity, i.e., <b>to suspend</b> the status of <i>teruma</i>, <b>we</b> do in fact <b>suspend</b> its status and it may be neither burned nor eaten; is this distinction correct? <b>Do we</b> in fact <b>suspend</b> the status of ritually pure items in such a case, due to the concern that the dead man whom this individual touched might have already been dead in the first location?
<b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 3:5): With regard to a previously impure <b>needle that is found</b> on top of <i>teruma</i> and it is <b>full of rust or broken,</b> and therefore no longer contracts or transmit ritual impurity, the <i>teruma</i> remains <b>pure, as</b> it is presumed that in <b>all</b> cases of <b>impurity,</b> the items in question had already been in the same state as they were <b>at the time they were discovered? But why</b> should that be the case? <b>Let us say</b> that <b>initially,</b> when it had fallen onto the <i>teruma</i>, <b>this needle was a proper,</b> non-rusty and unbroken, <b>needle,</b> capable of contracting and transmitting ritual impurity, <b>and it is</b> only <b>now that rust</b> had <b>formed</b> on it. The status of the <i>teruma</i> should at least be held in suspension. Rather, it is evident that the <i>teruma</i> is considered definitely pure and is not held in suspension due to the possibility that it might have become impure from the nail at a previous time or, presumably, in a previous place.
<b>And furthermore, we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 9:9): If one <b>found</b> the carcass of <b>a burned creeping animal on top of</b> a pile of <b>olives,</b> and that animal no longer transmits impurity as it is burned, <b>and similarly</b> if one finds <b>a tattered rag</b> of a <i>zav</i>, which likewise no longer transmits impurity, on top of a pile of olives, the olives are <b>pure.</b> The reason is <b>that</b> it is presumed in <b>all</b> cases of <b>impurity,</b> the items in question had already been in the same state as they were <b>at the time they were discovered.</b> Once again, this demonstrates that when this presumption is applied, the item is considered definitely pure, and is not held in suspension due to uncertainty.
<b>And if you would say</b> that there is a difference between these last cases, where the items did not move, and the case of the basket that moved, this distinction is not correct. The suggestion is that in the last cases the items are treated entirely as if they had always been as they were <b>at the time they were discovered, whether</b> this leads <b>to a leniency,</b> as in the cases of the needle and the rag, <b>and whether</b> it leads <b>to a stringency,</b> in the case of one who touched someone at night, when he is considered to be definitely impure, <b>but</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> only with regard to the <b>place</b> where <b>they were discovered,</b> i.e., if they did not move. <b>But</b> with regard to a location that is <b>not the place</b> where <b>they were discovered,</b> we do suspect that ritual impurity moved from place to place, and therefore although <b>we do not burn</b> the <i>teruma</i> in question, <b>we hold it in suspension.</b>
The Gemara refutes this suggestion: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Teharot</i> 4:3): There was <b>a loaf</b> resting <b>on top</b> of <b>a shelf, and</b> there was <b>an item of light impurity,</b> e.g., a garment of a <i>zav</i>, which transmits impurity to food but not to people or vessels, <b>lying underneath it,</b> and the loaf was later found on the ground. <b>Even though</b> the situation was such <b>that if</b> the loaf <b>fell</b> to the ground it would be <b>impossible</b> for it to have done anything <b>other than touch</b> the impure garment on its way down, nevertheless the loaf is <b>pure.</b> The reason is <b>that I say</b> that <b>a ritually pure man entered there and took it</b> off the shelf and placed it onto the ground without it touching the impure garment.
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: This ruling applies <b>unless someone says: It is clear to me that no person entered</b> there. <b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> This principle is <b>necessary only when</b> the top shelf is <b>an inclined surface.</b> In other words, even if it is very likely that the loaf rolled off the shelf and touched the garment on its way down to the ground, nevertheless it is assumed to be pure. This indicates that one does not presume that the loaf contracted impurity and then fell to the ground where it was found. Since such a possibility is not even entertained to the extent that the <i>teruma</i> is held in suspension, this demonstrates that in a case involving a movement from one place to another there is no presumption of ritual impurity at all.
The Gemara explains that no proof can be cited from <b>there, as</b> that <i>baraita</i> explicitly <b>teaches</b> the <b>reason</b> for its ruling:

Daf 4b

The reason is not <b>that</b> one does not presume that ritual impurity moved from place to place, but because <b>I say</b> that <b>a ritually pure man entered there and took it</b> off the shelf and placed it onto the ground, avoiding the impure garment it would have hit had it fallen. When there is no such explanation, the principle that one presumes impurity moved from place to place does apply, e.g., in the case of the basket where the carcass of a creeping animal was found inside.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Here, too, let us say</b> that <b>a raven,</b> which often touches creeping animals, <b>came and threw</b> the creeping animal into the basket when it was in the second corner, after the produce had been emptied from it. The Gemara rejects this claim: In the case of <b>a person, who</b> acts <b>with intent, we</b> can <b>say</b> that perhaps a person moved the loaf from the shelf onto the ground. By contrast, with regard to <b>a raven, which</b> does <b>not</b> act <b>with intent, we</b> do <b>not say</b> that perhaps it committed such a purposeful act.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to the ruling of the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Now</b> the status of <b>this loaf</b> found on the ground <b>is</b> one of <b>uncertain impurity</b> found <b>in a private domain, and</b> the guiding principle in <b>any</b> case of <b>uncertainty</b> involving <b>impurity in a private domain</b> is that the item with <b>uncertain</b> status is deemed <b>impure.</b> If so, shouldn’t the loaf be deemed impure? The Gemara answers: No, <b>as</b> this <b>is an entity that lacks consciousness</b> in order for it <b>to be asked, and</b> the guiding principle is that with regard to <b>any entity that lacks consciousness</b> in order for it <b>to be asked, whether</b> it is found <b>in a public domain or in a private domain,</b> the item with <b>uncertain</b> status is deemed <b>pure.</b>
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: That principle, that in any case of uncertainty involving impurity in a private domain the item with uncertain status is deemed impure, applies to a case of impurity by Torah law, whereas <b>here</b> we are dealing <b>with ritual impurity by rabbinic law.</b> The Gemara adds: The language of the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>is also precise, as it teaches:</b> There was a loaf resting on top of a shelf, and there was an item of light impurity [<i>madaf</i> ] lying underneath it. The term <b><i>madaf</i></b> is similar to that <b>which is written: “A driven leaf [<i>niddaf</i> ]”</b> (Leviticus 26:36), i.e., a light item. Likewise, the <i>Tosefta</i> is referring to a light, or rabbinic, impurity.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is <b>neither in accordance with the statement of this</b> <i>tanna</i> nor in accordance with the statement of that <i>tanna</i>. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is <b>neither in accordance with the statement of this</b> <i>tanna</i> <b>nor in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>that</b> <i>tanna</i>. It is <b>not accordance with the statement of Shammai,</b> who rules that her time is sufficient and she does not need to be concerned that her menstrual flow started earlier, <b>as he did not enact</b> any <b>safeguard for his statement. And</b> is it <b>not in accordance with the statement of Hillel,</b> who rules that she assumes ritual impurity status retroactive to the time of her most recent examination, <b>as</b> he <b>went beyond [<i>hifriz</i>] his bounds</b> with his safeguard.
The Rabbis continue: <b>Rather,</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period reduces</b> the time <b>from examination to examination,</b> i.e., if her most recent self-examination took place more than twenty-four hours earlier, she need concern herself with ritual impurity only for the twenty-four-hour period prior to discerning the blood. <b>And from examination to examination reduces</b> the time <b>from</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period,</b> i.e., if she examined herself in the course of the previous day and discovered no blood, she was definitely pure prior to the examination.
The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: A twenty-four-hour <b>period reduces</b> the time <b>from examination to examination, how so?</b> A woman <b>examined herself on Sunday and found</b> that she was <b>ritually pure, and</b> then <b>she sat</b> through <b>Monday and Tuesday and did not examine</b> herself. <b>And</b> then <b>on Wednesday she examined herself and found</b> that she was <b>impure.</b> In such a case <b>we do not say</b> that <b>she should be impure</b> retroactively <b>from</b> the time of this <b>examination</b> extending back <b>until</b> the time of her most recent <b>examination. Rather,</b> she is impure retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: And <b>from examination to examination reduces</b> the time <b>from</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period, how so?</b> A woman <b>examined herself</b> in <b>the first hour</b> of a day <b>and found</b> that she was <b>ritually pure, and</b> then <b>she sat</b> through the <b>second and third</b> hours of the day <b>and did not examine</b> herself. <b>And</b> then <b>at the fourth</b> hour <b>she examined herself and found</b> that she was <b>impure.</b> In such a case <b>we do not say</b> that <b>she should be impure</b> retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period. Rather,</b> she is impure retroactively <b>from</b> the time of this <b>examination</b> extending back <b>until</b> the time of her most recent <b>examination,</b> three hours earlier.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: This <i>halakha</i> is <b>obvious. Since she examined herself at the first hour and found</b> that she was <b>pure,</b> there is <b>no</b> reason <b>to render her impure</b> retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period.</b> Why does the <i>baraita</i> state such an obvious <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: Since the <i>baraita</i> taught that according to the Rabbis a twenty-four-hour <b>period reduces</b> the time <b>from examination to examination,</b> it <b>also taught</b> the parallel case, that <b>from examination to examination reduces</b> the time <b>from</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period,</b> despite the fact that this <i>halakha</i> is obvious.
<b>Rabba says: What</b> is the <b>reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis? A woman</b> can <b>sense within herself</b> if she is experiencing a flow of blood. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rabba: <b>If so, her time should be sufficient,</b> as there should be no concern that her flow began earlier. The Gemara explains: <b>And Rabba</b> did not in fact mean this explanation seriously; rather, he <b>wanted to hone</b> the mind of <b>Abaye.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>what</b> is the real <b>reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis?</b>
The Gemara answers: It is <b>in accordance with that which Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel says: The Sages instituted that the Jewish women should examine themselves</b> twice each day, <b>morning and evening.</b> The <b>morning</b> examination is in order <b>to render fit</b> the <b>ritually pure</b> items <b>of the night,</b> i.e., any items that she touched the night before. <b>And</b> the <b>evening</b> examination is in order <b>to render fit</b> the <b>pure</b> items that she touched <b>during the day.</b>
The Gemara continues its explanation: <b>And this</b> woman, <b>since she did not examine</b> herself in accordance with the rabbinic enactment, <b>she loses</b> the status of the ritually pure items she touched over the <b>period [<i>ona</i>]</b> of a day or a night. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by: <b>Period</b> of a day or a night? Doesn’t her retroactive impurity status extend back for a twenty-four-hour period? The Gemara answers: It means <b>an additional period</b> of a day or a night, i.e., twenty-four hours in total.
<b>Rav Pappa says to Rava: But</b> occasionally <b>you find three periods</b> of day or night within a twenty-four-hour period. For example, if she examined herself on Monday afternoon and finds blood, then the twenty-four-hour period extending back to Sunday afternoon includes three periods of day or night: Monday day, Sunday night and Sunday day from the time of her most recent examination, as these twenty-four hours do not fit precisely into two such periods. The Gemara answers: <b>The Sages rendered their measures equal, so</b> that <b>one should not differentiate</b> between cases. In other words, they wanted to issue a uniform ruling that applies universally <b>and</b> therefore they established a set twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> of retroactive impurity, regardless of the circumstances.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that they established the set twenty-four-hour period <b>so that the sinner should not profit</b> from his transgression. If the extent of retroactive impurity would be fixed at one additional period of day or night, a woman who remembers and examines herself in the early morning would be impure retroactively for a full twenty-four hours, back to early morning the previous day, whereas one who waits until noon would be impure only for the period of the morning and the previous night.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between</b> these two answers? The Gemara answers: The difference <b>between</b> them is in a case <b>where she was prevented</b> by outside circumstances <b>and did not perform an examination.</b> According to the second answer she would not be considered a sinner and therefore she would be impure only for an additional period of a day or night. By contrast, according to the first answer her impure status would span twenty-four hours regardless of the circumstances.
§ The mishna teaches: For <b>any woman who has a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle,</b> and she examined herself at that time and discovered blood, her time is sufficient, and she transmits impurity only from that time onward. The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa, and not</b> in accordance with <b>the</b> opinion of <b>the Rabbis? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: There are four</b> categories of <b>women</b> for whom the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>their time is sufficient: A virgin,</b> i.e., a girl who has never experienced menstruation, <b>a pregnant woman, a nursing</b> mother, <b>and an elderly woman. Rabbi Dosa says:</b> For <b>every woman who has a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle,</b> and she examined herself at that time and discovered blood, <b>her time is sufficient,</b> and it is only from that stage that she transmits ritual impurity.
The Gemara answers: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. The Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Dosa only in</b> the case of a woman who discovers blood at an irregular time, <b>not at the fixed time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle. But</b> if she discovers blood <b>at the fixed time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle, they agree with him</b> that her time is sufficient and there is no retroactive impurity. <b>And the mishna</b> is referring to a woman who discovers blood <b>at the fixed time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle, and</b> therefore <b>everyone agrees</b> that her time is sufficient.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>By inference,</b> one can conclude <b>that Rabbi Dosa says</b> that her time is sufficient <b>even</b> if she discovers blood <b>not at the fixed time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle.</b> If so, <b>who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a woman who has a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle</b> who finds a blood stain, <b>her</b> blood <b>stain</b> is <b>impure retroactively</b> from when the garment in question was laundered. The reason is <b>that if she sees</b> a flow of menstrual blood <b>not at the fixed time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle,</b> it renders her impure retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period.</b> Therefore, the blood stain likewise renders her retroactively impure.
The Gemara concludes its question: <b>Shall we say</b> that this <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis and not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa,</b> as one can claim that <b>Rabbi Dosa disagrees with the Rabbis only</b> in a case where a woman sees menstrual blood <b>at the fixed time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle. But</b> if she sees blood <b>not at the fixed time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle, he agrees</b> with them that she is impure retroactively. <b>And</b> according to this answer <b>the mishna,</b> which deals with a woman who discovers blood <b>at the fixed time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle, is</b> only in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa,</b> in contrast to the earlier claim.

Daf 5a

<b>And</b> as for the ruling of <b>the <i>baraita</i>,</b> that a woman who discovers menstrual blood not at her fixed time for menstruation is impure retroactively, this is a <i>halakha</i> with which <b>everyone agrees.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But let</b> us <b>interpret</b> the mishna in the <b>opposite</b> manner. Why interpret the mishna in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Dosa and the <i>baraita</i> in accordance with everyone, when we can give precedence to the mishna, which is more authoritative, by interpreting it in accordance with all opinions, as was first explained, and the <i>baraita</i> only in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis.
The Gemara answers: <b>Since there is</b> a way <b>to interpret</b> it <b>as a leniency,</b> i.e., that all agree that blood discovered at the fixed time of menstruation renders items impure only from that point onward, <b>and</b> it can also be interpreted in a manner that leads <b>to a stringency,</b> i.e., everyone agrees that blood discovered not at her fixed time for menstruation causes retroactive impurity, and furthermore the Rabbis hold that this is the <i>halakha</i> even when blood is discovered at her fixed time of menstruation, <b>we interpret</b> it the way that leads <b>to a stringency.</b>
§ It <b>is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: If a woman who has a fixed menstrual cycle finds a blood stain, her blood stain is retroactively impure. The reason is <b>that if she sees</b> a flow of menstrual blood <b>not at the fixed time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle,</b> it renders her ritually impure retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period.</b> The Gemara analyzes this statement: The <b>reason</b> for this ruling is <b>that</b> she is <b>a woman who has a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle;</b> therefore, <b>the Rabbis distinguish between her</b> blood <b>stain,</b> which causes retroactive impurity like a sighting not at her fixed time, <b>and her sighting</b> of her menstrual flow at its fixed time, which does not cause retroactive impurity.
It can be inferred from here that in the case of those <b>other women,</b> e.g., a pregnant or elderly woman, <b>with regard to</b> whom <b>the Sages stated: Their time is sufficient</b> and their menstrual flow never causes retroactive impurity, the same <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>their</b> blood <b>stains as</b> to <b>their sighting</b> of their menstrual flow, i.e., the stains do not cause retroactive impurity.
The Gemara asks: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this <i>baraita</i> taught? The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus, as Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel says in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus:</b> The <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to all women</b> is that <b>their</b> blood <b>stains are impure retroactively. But</b> any <b>women with regard to</b> whom <b>the Sages stated: Their time is sufficient, their</b> blood <b>stains</b> share the same ruling <b>as their sighting</b> of their menstrual flow, i.e., they do not cause retroactive impurity. This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>except</b> for the case of <b>a young girl whose time to see</b> the flow of menstrual blood <b>has not arrived.</b> With regard to her, <b>even if her sheets are soiled with blood one</b> need <b>not be concerned for it,</b> i.e., her blood stains do not cause any impurity at all, even from that point onward.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does <b>Rabbi Ḥanina</b> ben Antigonus <b>hold</b> that a blood <b>stain</b> causes ritual impurity <b>at all? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>all women</b> is that <b>their</b> blood <b>stains are impure. And</b> similarly, <b>women with regard to</b> whom <b>the Sages stated: Their time is sufficient, their</b> blood <b>stains are</b> also <b>impure. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of <b>women with regard to</b> whom <b>the Sages stated: Their time is sufficient,</b> is that <b>they do not have</b> the ritual impurity of a blood <b>stain. What, is it not</b> correct to say that this means <b>they have no</b> impurity caused by a blood <b>stain at all?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it means that <b>they do not have</b> impurity caused by a blood <b>stain retroactively, but they do have</b> the impurity caused by a blood <b>stain from here onward.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>From the fact that</b> Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus holds that a blood stain imparts ritual impurity from that point onward, does this not indicate that <b>the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that it causes ritual impurity <b>even retroactively?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> the ruling of the first <i>tanna</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who is stringent with regard to</b> blood <b>stains. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>all women</b> is that <b>their</b> blood <b>stains are impure retroactively. And</b> similarly, <b>women with regard to</b> whom <b>the Sages stated: Their time is sufficient, their</b> blood <b>stains are</b> also <b>impure retroactively.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of <b>women with regard to</b> whom <b>the Sages stated: Their time is sufficient,</b> is that <b>their</b> blood <b>stains</b> share the same ruling <b>as their sighting</b> of their menstrual flow, i.e., they cause ritual impurity from that point onward. <b>And</b> in the case of <b>a young girl, if her time to see</b> the flow of menstrual blood <b>has arrived,</b> then <b>she has</b> impurity status when she finds a blood <b>stain. But if her time to see</b> the flow of menstrual blood <b>has not</b> yet <b>arrived, she does not have</b> impurity status when she finds a blood <b>stain.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And when</b> does a young girl <b>arrive</b> at <b>her time to see</b> the flow of menstrual blood? The Gemara answers: <b>When the days of</b> her <b>young womanhood have arrived.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> with regard to a woman <b>who engages in intercourse while</b> using <b>examination cloths,</b> with which she ascertains whether the menstrual flow began, since the halakhic status of that act is like that of an examination, it reduces the time from a twenty-four-hour period and reduces the time from examination to examination. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b>examination cloth</b> with <b>which</b> she examined herself <b>before intercourse does not reduce</b> the time from a twenty-four-hour period <b>like</b> a regular <b>examination.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion of Shmuel? <b>Rav Ketina says: Since she is excited [<i>shemehuma</i>]</b> and hurried <b>for</b> intercourse with <b>her husband,</b> it is not considered a proper examination. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> even <b>if she is excited for</b> intercourse with <b>her husband, what of it?</b> Why does that invalidate her examination? The Gemara answers: <b>Since she is excited</b> and hurried <b>for</b> intercourse with <b>her husband, she does not insert</b> the examination cloth <b>into</b> her <b>recesses and folds.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: And a woman <b>who engages in intercourse while</b> using <b>examination cloths,</b> the halakhic status of that act <b>is like that of an examination.</b> The mishna refers to examination cloths in the plural. <b>What, is it not</b> speaking of <b>one</b> cloth used <b>before intercourse and one</b> cloth used <b>after intercourse?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No, this</b> cloth <b>and that</b> cloth are both used <b>after intercourse; and</b> the reason why the mishna uses the plural is that <b>one</b> cloth is <b>for his</b> use <b>and one</b> is <b>for her</b> use. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (14a): It is the <b>custom of Jewish women to engage in intercourse</b> with their husbands <b>with two examination cloths, one for his</b> use <b>and one for her</b> use.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is this? Granted, if you say</b> that the mishna is referring to <b>one</b> cloth used <b>before intercourse and one</b> used <b>after intercourse,</b> it <b>was necessary</b> for the mishna to mention both examinations, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since she is excited</b> and hurried <b>for</b> intercourse with <b>her husband, she did not examine</b> herself <b>properly.</b> Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that her examination with a cloth before intercourse <b>is</b> considered <b>as</b> a halakhically valid <b>examination. But if you say</b> that <b>this</b> cloth <b>and that</b> cloth are his and her cloths used <b>after intercourse,</b> isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that they are treated as halakhic examinations? Why is this ruling necessary?
The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> that the examinations performed after intercourse count as valid examinations is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>perhaps</b> she might <b>see a drop of blood corresponding</b> to the size of <b>a mustard seed and</b> a drop of <b>semen covered it.</b> In other words, it is possible that she discharged a tiny amount of menstrual blood that went undetected, as it was covered by a drop of semen. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that one does not need to be concerned for this possibility.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: The mishna is referring only to her examinations, but the reason the mishna mentions two examinations is not to give them the status of valid examinations, but to teach that they are both obligatory. As <b>the Sages required her</b> to perform <b>two examinations: One before intercourse and one after intercourse. And when</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> The halakhic status of that act <b>is like that of an examination,</b> it is referring specifically <b>to</b> the examination performed <b>after intercourse.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> A woman <b>who engages</b> in intercourse while using examination cloths. This formulation indicates that the examination is voluntary and is not mandated by the Sages. The Gemara explains that one should emend the text of the mishna so that it <b>teaches: And</b> a woman must <b>engage</b> in intercourse while using examination cloths.
§ The mishna teaches: And with regard to a woman who engages in intercourse while using examination cloths, as the halakhic status of that act is like that of an examination, <b>it reduces</b> the time <b>from</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period,</b> and reduces the time from examination to examination. The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> that the mishna teaches that this examination <b>reduces</b> time <b>from</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period,</b>

Daf 5b

<b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to teach that an examination reduces the time <b>from examination to examination,</b> which is less than twenty-four hours?
The Gemara answers: This ruling is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that with regard to the significant passage of a twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> the <b>Sages are</b> concerned <b>for</b> the possible <b>loss of ritually pure items, but</b> with regard to the smaller period <b>from examination to examination,</b> the Sages are <b>not</b> concerned for the loss of pure items, and therefore the use of an examination cloth should not reduce the time of possible impurity between that and her next examination. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that it does reduce this time.
§ The mishna teaches with regard to a woman who has a fixed menstrual cycle: <b>Her time is sufficient, how so?</b> If the woman was sitting in a bed and engaged in handling ritually pure items, and she left the bed and saw blood, she is impure and those items are pure. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the mishna <b>to teach:</b> If the woman <b>was sitting in a bed and engaged in</b> handling <b>pure items? Let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> the same ruling without mentioning the bed: If she <b>was engaged in</b> handling <b>pure items and she left and saw</b> blood. The detail that she was sitting in a bed is apparently superfluous.
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> detail <b>teaches us</b> that the <b>reason</b> why the bed is not rendered impure is <b>that her time is sufficient</b> and there is no retroactive impurity. It can be inferred that in a case where she is impure retroactively for a twenty-four-hour <b>period, her bed is also rendered impure.</b> This <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Ze’eiri, as Ze’eiri said:</b> The level of impurity of the retroactive twenty-four-hour <b>period of a menstruating woman renders</b> impure <b>a bed</b> upon which she lies <b>and a chair</b> upon which she sits, <b>to</b> the extent that they <b>transmit impurity to a person</b> who comes in contact with them, <b>to</b> the extent that he <b>transmits impurity to the garments</b> he is wearing.
This Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Now, this bed</b> upon which she sat <b>is an entity that lacks consciousness</b> in order for it <b>to be asked,</b> and the principle with regard to <b>any entity that lacks consciousness</b> in order for it <b>to be asked</b> is that the item with <b>uncertain</b> status is deemed <b>pure.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Ze’eiri interpreted</b> his ruling as applying specifically to a case <b>where her friends are carrying her in the bed, where</b> the bed <b>is</b> considered as the extended <b>hand of her friends.</b> In other words, it is part of an entity that has consciousness in order for it to be asked, and therefore the item with uncertain status is deemed impure.
The Gemara provides another answer: <b>And now that Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> In a case of <b>uncertain ritual impurity that comes</b> about <b>by the hand of a person,</b> i.e., through his involvement, the owner of the vessel must <b>consult</b> a Sage <b>about it,</b> i.e., it is considered an entity that has consciousness in order for it to be asked, as in such a case <b>even with regard to a vessel that is placed upon the ground,</b> which is certainly incapable of providing an answer if asked, its halakhic status is <b>like</b> that of <b>an item that has consciousness</b> in order for it <b>to be asked.</b> With this statement in mind, one can explain that according to Ze’eiri a menstruating woman transmits impurity to a bed <b>even though her friends are not carrying her in the bed.</b> Rather, as the bed’s ritual impurity was caused by the hand of a person, it has the halakhic status of an item that has consciousness in order for it to be asked.
§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement <b>itself. Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In a case of <b>uncertain ritual impurity</b> that <b>comes</b> about <b>by the hand of man,</b> its owner must <b>consult</b> a Sage <b>about it,</b> i.e., it is ritually impure, as in such a case <b>even with regard to a vessel that is placed upon the ground,</b> its halakhic status is <b>like</b> that of <b>an item that has consciousness</b> in order for it <b>to be asked.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Teharot</i> 4:1): If a man who contracted ritual impurity <b>was wrapping</b> himself <b>in his cloak and</b> there were <b>pure</b> items beside him; <b>or</b> if he was pure and there were <b>impure</b> items <b>beside him</b> as he was wrapping his cloak; <b>or</b> if there were <b>pure</b> items and <b>impure</b> items <b>above his head</b> at the time and there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether he <b>touched</b> the impure items with his cloak and then touched the pure items with his cloak, and <b>uncertainty</b> whether it did <b>not touch</b> them, the <i>halakha</i> is that the pure items remain <b>pure. But if</b> it is <b>impossible</b> for him to have wrapped himself <b>unless</b> his cloak had <b>touched</b> the impure items in the process, then those previously pure items become <b>impure.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says</b> that <b>we say to him: Repeat</b> your action. <b>And he repeats</b> the action of wrapping himself with his cloak, and it can then be determined whether or not the cloak and the other items came in contact with each other. The Rabbis <b>said to him: We do</b> not rely on <b>repeated</b> actions <b>with regard to</b> the determination of ritually <b>pure</b> items. Since the second action may not exactly mimic the first, it cannot be relied upon to determine ritual purity status.
The Gemara explains the objection: But according to the Rabbis, <b>why</b> is the <i>halakha</i> that the items in question remain pure? <b>Isn’t</b> this a case of <b>uncertain ritual impurity that comes</b> about <b>by the hand of man,</b> which, according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, is considered as having consciousness in order for it to be asked? If so, these items should be ritually impure.
The Gemara answers: <b>Except for that</b> one, i.e., do not raise a difficulty from that <i>baraita</i>, since it is referring to a specific case. <b>As Rav Hoshaya teaches</b> with regard to an item whose purity status is uncertain: When it is <b>in the private domain,</b> the item with <b>uncertain</b> status is deemed <b>impure;</b> when it is <b>in the public domain,</b> it is deemed <b>pure.</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to an item located in the public domain. Consequently, even if it is considered as having consciousness in order to be asked, nevertheless it is pure, as its uncertainty occurred in the public domain.
§ The Gemara analyzes <b>the</b> matter of Ze’eiri’s ruling <b>itself. Ze’eiri says:</b> The level of impurity assumed during the retroactive twenty-four-hour <b>period of a menstruating woman renders a bed</b> upon which she lies <b>and a chair</b> upon which she sits impure <b>to</b> the extent that they <b>transmit impurity to a person</b> who comes in contact with them <b>to</b> the extent that he <b>transmits impurity to the garments</b> he is wearing.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But when Avimi came from Bei Ḥozai, he came and brought</b> the following <b><i>baraita</i> with him:</b> The level of impurity during the retroactive twenty-four-hour <b>period of a menstruating woman</b> renders <b>her bed</b> upon which she lies <b>and her chair</b> upon which she sits impure <b>like</b> the impurity level caused by <b>her touch.</b> The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that this means that <b>just as</b> an item rendered impure by <b>her touch</b> does <b>not render</b> another <b>person impure, so too, her bed</b> does <b>not render</b> another <b>person impure?</b>
<b>Rava says: And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> it in that manner? There <b>is an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference here: <b>And if an earthenware vessel sealed</b> with <b>a tightly bound cover, which is spared</b> from impurity when it is <b>in a tent</b> that has <b>a corpse</b> in it, is nevertheless <b>not spared</b> from impurity if the woman moved it <b>during</b> the twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> of retroactive impurity <b>of a menstruating woman</b> and is impure as though she moved it after she experienced bleeding; <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>beds and chairs, which are not spared</b> from impurity <b>in a tent</b> that has <b>a corpse</b> in it, <b>is it not logical that they are</b> also <b>not spared</b> from impurity when used <b>during the</b> twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> of retroactive impurity <b>of a menstruating woman</b> and are impure as though she used them after she experienced bleeding?
The Gemara asks: <b>But Avimi from Bei Ḥozai cited a <i>baraita</i></b> that apparently does not accept Rava’s <i>a fortiori</i> inference. The Gemara answers: One can <b>say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> does not mean that her bed and chair are rendered impure with the light level of impurity caused by her touch, but rather: <b>Her bed</b> upon which she lies <b>and her chair</b> upon which she sits

Daf 6a

are <b>like</b> her <b>touch itself. Just as</b> her touch <b>transmits impurity to a person</b> who comes in contact with them <b>to</b> the extent that he <b>transmits impurity to the garments</b> he is wearing, <b>so too</b> her bed and her chair <b>transmit impurity to a person</b> who comes in contact with them <b>to</b> the extent that he <b>transmits impurity to the garments</b> he is wearing.
§ It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava:</b> If a woman <b>sees</b> menstrual <b>blood,</b> it <b>renders her impure</b> retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period. And</b> what does <b>she render impure</b> during that period? <b>Beds and chairs, food and drink, and an earthenware vessel sealed</b> with <b>a tightly bound cover [<i>tzamid patil</i>],</b> if she moves it. <b>But she does not disrupt her count</b> of the periods of menstruation and <i>ziva</i>, i.e., she starts her cycle only from that day when she saw the blood, <b>and she does not render impure retroactively a man who engaged in intercourse with her. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> She does <b>render impure a man who engaged in intercourse with her. And she counts</b> her seven days of impurity <b>only from the time that she saw</b> her menstrual blood, not retroactively.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to a woman <b>who sees</b> a blood <b>stain,</b> it <b>renders her impure retroactive</b> to when the garment was last checked. <b>And</b> what does <b>she render impure</b> during that period? <b>Food and drink, beds and chairs, and an earthenware vessel sealed</b> with <b>a tightly bound cover,</b> if she moves it. <b>And</b> it also <b>disrupts her count</b> of eleven days during which emission of blood renders the woman a <i>zava</i>, as the time of the stain is unknown, <b>and she renders</b> ritually <b>impure a man who engaged in intercourse with her. And she counts</b> her seven days of impurity <b>only from the time that she saw</b> her menstrual blood, not retroactively.
The <i>baraita</i> further teaches: With regard to both <b>this,</b> one who sees menstrual blood, <b>and that,</b> one who sees a blood stain, if they had touched <i>teruma</i>, its status is <b>suspended.</b> It is <b>not eaten,</b> as impure <i>teruma</i> is prohibited in consumption, <b>but</b> it is <b>not burned</b> either, since it is prohibited to burn pure <i>teruma</i>.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rava,</b> why is the <i>halakha</i> <b>of</b> an earthenware vessel more obvious to him than the <i>halakha</i> of a bed and a chair? <b>If he</b> had <b>heard</b> this <b><i>baraita</i>,</b> which states the <i>halakha</i> of an earthenware vessel, then <b>let him say</b> that the <b><i>baraita</i></b> itself is proof for his opinion with regard to a bed and a chair as well, as the <i>baraita</i> states both <i>halakhot</i>. <b>And if he</b> had <b>not heard</b> this <b><i>baraita</i>, from where</b> did he learn his <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, which is based on the <i>halakha</i> that an earthenware vessel sealed with a tightly bound cover is not spared from impurity if a menstruating woman moved it during her twenty-four-hour period of retroactive impurity?
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually, he</b> did <b>hear</b> the <b><i>baraita</i>. But if</b> his proof had been merely <b>from the <i>baraita</i>, I would say</b> that a different <i>halakha</i> applies to a bed and chair than to the earthenware vessels, as the <i>baraita</i> means that the bed and chair render impure <b>a person or garments</b> that they touch, <b>but</b> they do <b>not</b> render <b>a person</b> impure to the extent that he then transmits impurity to his <b>garments.</b> It is <b>due to that</b> reason that Rava <b>says</b> the <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference.
§ <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> of retroactive impurity <b>of</b> a <b>menstruating woman</b> applies only <b>to sacrificial</b> food <b>but not to <i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so, let</b> the mishna in <i>Ḥagiga</i> 20b <b>teach</b> this <b>among</b> the other higher <b>levels</b> of purity that apply to sacrificial foods but not to <i>teruma</i>. That mishna lists stringencies of ritual purity that are in effect with regard to sacrificial foods and not <i>teruma</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> that mishna <b>teaches</b> those higher levels of purity, it is referring only to types of impurity <b>that have a connection [<i>derara</i>] to impurity</b> as defined by Torah law. <b>But</b> it <b>does not teach</b> a case <b>where there is no connection to impurity</b> as defined by Torah law, and the retroactive impurity of a menstruating woman is by rabbinic law.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the aforementioned <i>baraita</i> that deals with the retroactive impurity of a menstruating woman: What does <b>she render impure</b> during that period? <b>Food and drink.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that this is referring <b>both to sacrificial</b> food <b>and to <i>teruma</i>? The</b> Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is referring only <b>to sacrificial</b> food, not to <i>teruma</i>.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (11a): With regard to women of priestly families who must examine themselves before partaking of <i>teruma</i>, <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even when they conclude partaking of <i>teruma</i>,</b> they still need to examine themselves. <b>And we discussed</b> this statement of Rabbi Yehuda and asked: Why do they need to examine themselves after they finish eating <i>teruma</i>? <b>What was, was;</b> i.e., if a woman was impure when she ate the <i>teruma</i>, what is achieved by an examination now?
And <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> in explanation: <b>It was necessary only</b> in order <b>to amend the</b> situation of the <b>remaining</b> <i>teruma</i> that is left <b>before her,</b> i.e., to prevent it from being rendered ritually impure. In other words, if she later experiences a flow of menstrual blood, her retroactive impurity status will not render the remaining <i>teruma</i> impure. This ruling apparently contradicts the opinion of Rav Huna, who said that the retroactive impurity of a menstruating woman affects only sacrificial foods, not <i>teruma</i>.
The Gemara answers: According to <b>Rav Huna,</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>teaches</b> that since impure <i>teruma</i> must be burned, she must examine herself in order to determine whether it is correct <b>to burn</b> the <b>remaining</b> <i>teruma</i> that was <b>in her hands.</b> If she <b>examined herself</b> immediately after eating the <i>teruma</i>, in the <b>period of time</b> needed for the onset of <b>menstruation</b> (see 14b), and she found that she was impure, it is assumed as a certainty that she was impure when she ate the <i>teruma</i>. Consequently, the remaining <i>teruma</i> must be burned, in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> of <i>teruma</i> that was definitely rendered impure. But in fact, Rav Huna maintains that she does not render that remaining <i>teruma</i> impure retroactively, in a case where she did not examine herself.
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another difficulty with regard to the opinion of Rav Huna from a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident</b> in which <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>performed an action</b> by ruling that the <i>halakha</i> <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b> Rabbi Eliezer maintains that a woman who passed three expected menstrual cycles without experiencing bleeding is presumed not to be menstruating any longer, and therefore any menstrual blood that she emits later renders her ritually impure only from then onward, but not retroactively. By contrast, the Rabbis contend that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to an older woman, for whom it is natural to stop menstruating, but not to a young woman, even if three typical periods have passed without bleeding.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>After</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>remembered</b> that Rabbi Eliezer’s colleagues disagree with Rabbi Eliezer on this matter and that he had apparently ruled incorrectly, <b>he</b> nevertheless <b>said: Rabbi Eliezer is worthy [<i>kedai</i>] to rely upon</b>

Daf 6b

<b>in exigent circumstances [<i>bishe’at hadeḥak</i>]. And we discussed it</b> and asked: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>After he remembered? If we say</b> that this means <b>after he remembered that the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer but in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> if so, <b>how could</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>act in accordance with</b> Rabbi Eliezer even <b>in exigent circumstances,</b> since the <i>halakha</i> has been decided against him?
<b>Rather, is it not</b> correct that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> had <b>not been stated</b> on this matter, <b>neither in accordance with</b> the opinion of this <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>nor in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis. <b>And once</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>remembered that it was not a single</b> authority who <b>disagrees with</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>but</b> it was several Sages who <b>disagreed with him,</b> and there is a principle that the <i>halakha</i> follows the opinion of the many over that of an individual, <b>he</b> nevertheless <b>said: Rabbi Eliezer is worthy to rely upon in exigent circumstances.</b>
The Gemara explains the proof from the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that it was a case <b>of</b> a menstruating woman who had touched <b><i>teruma</i></b> during the previous twenty-four hours, <b>this is</b> fine, <b>as <i>teruma</i></b> still <b>existed in the days of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>But</b> if you say that it was a case <b>of</b> a woman who touched <b>sacrificial</b> food, <b>was there</b> still <b>sacrificial</b> food <b>in days of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, after the destruction of the Temple? Clearly, the case involved <i>teruma</i>, and according to the Rabbis, whose opinion is accepted as <i>halakha</i>, this woman who had skipped three menstrual cycles nevertheless renders <i>teruma</i> impure retroactively. This ruling apparently contradicts the opinion of Rav Huna.
The Gemara answers: This can be answered <b>in accordance with</b> the testimony <b>of Ulla, as Ulla said: <i>Ḥaverim</i> purify</b> their wine and oil <b>in the Galilee,</b> i.e., they produce their wine and oil by the standards of purity used for sacrificial food, in the hope that the Temple will be rebuilt in their lifetime. <b>Here, too, in the days of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi there were those who kept the standards of purity observed for sacrificial food.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving the maidservant of Rabban Gamliel, who was baking loaves of <i>teruma</i></b> bread. <b>And in between each and every one she</b> would <b>wash her hand in water and examine</b> herself. <b>After</b> the <b>last</b> one she <b>examined</b> herself <b>and found</b> that she was <b>impure</b> due to menstrual blood, <b>and she came and asked Rabban Gamliel</b> about the status of the loaves. <b>And he said to her: They are all impure,</b> due to her retroactive impurity for the previous twenty-four hours. <b>She said to him: My teacher, didn’t I perform an examination in between each and every one?</b> Rabban Gamliel <b>said to her: If so,</b> then <b>this</b> last one is <b>impure and</b> the rest are <b>all pure,</b> as your retroactive impurity is reduced until the time of the most recent examination.
The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that the case involved <b>loaves of <i>teruma</i></b> bread. This apparently contradicts the opinion of Rav Huna, as Rabban Gamliel applied retroactive impurity in a case of <i>teruma</i>. The Gemara answers: What is meant by: <i>Teruma</i>? It means <b><i>teruma</i> of the loaves of the thanks offering,</b> i.e., the four loaves of the thanks offering that were separated from the total of forty and eaten by the priests. These are sacrificial foods, not <i>teruma</i>. The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this interpretation: <b>What</b> was she <b>doing baking the <i>teruma</i> of the loaves of the thanks offering</b> alone? All forty loaves of the thanks offering are baked together, and only afterward are four set aside as <i>teruma</i> to be eaten by priests.
The Gemara answers: This is referring to a case <b>where</b> dough for the <i>teruma</i> loaves <b>was separated</b> and designated for the priests <b>during its kneading. And</b> this <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with that which Rav Tovi bar Rav Ketina said:</b> If <b>one baked the loaves of the thanks offering as four loaves,</b> rather than the requisite forty loaves, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>And we discussed it</b> and asked: <b>Isn’t one required</b> to bring <b>forty</b> loaves with the thanks offering, ten loaves of each of the four different types? The Gemara answers: One must bake forty loaves in order <b>to</b> fulfill the <b>mitzva</b> in the optimal fashion, but he has nevertheless fulfilled his obligation with four loaves, one of each type.
The Gemara continues its answer by further elucidating the statement of Rav Tovi bar Rav Ketina. And we asked with regard to this opinion: <b>But he is required to separate <i>teruma</i> from it,</b> i.e., to designate one loaf from each type that is given to the priests. <b>And if you would say that he separates a slice from each one</b> of the four loaves and gives them to the priest, this cannot be the case, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: “And of it he shall present <b>one</b> out of each offering for a gift to the Lord; it shall be the priest’s” (Leviticus 7:14). The word “one” indicates <b>that he may not take a slice,</b> but rather he takes a complete loaf. The Gemara answers: Rather, <b>we</b> must <b>say</b> that he <b>separated</b> dough for the <i>teruma</i> loaves <b>during its kneading. Here too, in</b> the incident involving Rabban Gamliel’s maidservant, she <b>separated</b> the dough <b>during its kneading.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>another incident involving the maidservant of Rabban Gamliel who was sealing barrels of wine. And in between each and every one she</b> would <b>wash her hands in water and examine</b> herself. <b>And after the last</b> one <b>she examined</b> herself <b>and found</b> that she was ritually <b>impure, and she came and asked Rabban Gamliel</b> about the wine. <b>And he said to her: They are all impure. She said to him:</b> My teacher, <b>didn’t I perform an examination in between each and every one?</b> Rabban Gamliel <b>said to her: If so, this</b> last one is <b>impure and</b> the rest are <b>all pure.</b>
The Gemara clarifies the difficulty with regard to Rav Huna’s opinion: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>one</b> incident involved a case <b>of sacrificial</b> food <b>and one</b> incident involved a case <b>of <i>teruma</i>, this is</b> the reason <b>that she returned and</b> again <b>asked</b> Rabban Gamliel what to do. <b>But if you say</b> that both <b>this</b> incident <b>and that</b> incident <b>involved sacrificial</b> food, <b>why</b> did <b>she</b> need <b>to return and ask him</b> the same question a second time? The Gemara answers: Each <b>incident that occurred was</b> with sacrificial food and they happened <b>with two</b> different <b>maidservants.</b>
<b>Some say another version</b> of Rav Huna’s statement. <b>Rav Huna says:</b> During the twenty-four-hour <b>period of</b> retroactive impurity of <b>a menstruating woman,</b> she <b>renders impure</b> both <b>sacrificial</b> food and <b><i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is this derived? The Gemara answers: It can be inferred <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna in <i>Ḥagiga</i> (20b) <b>does not teach</b> this matter <b>among</b> the other matters where higher <b>levels</b> of purity are required only for sacrificial foods but not for <i>teruma</i>. <b>Rav Naḥman said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>But doesn’t</b> the <b><i>tanna</i></b> explicitly <b>teach</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The retroactive impurity of a menstruating woman applies only <b>with regard to sacrificial</b> food but <b>not with regard to <i>teruma</i>?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak received</b> the following explanation <b>from</b> Rav Naḥman: The <i>baraita</i> means that this retroactive impurity applies <b>to non-sacred</b> food <b>that was prepared according to</b> the standards of <b>purity of sacrificial</b> food, <b>but not to non-sacred</b> food <b>that was prepared</b> according to the standards of <b>purity of <i>teruma</i>.</b> It does apply to <i>teruma</i> itself.
§ With regard to a non-sacred food prepared according to the standards of purity of <i>teruma</i>, <b>we learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Ḥalla</i> 3:2): In a case of dough where <b>uncertainty developed</b> as to whether it was <b>ritually impure,</b> if the uncertainty developed <b>before it was kneaded, it may be prepared</b> even <b>in</b> definite <b>impurity,</b> i.e., with impure vessels. If it developed <b>after it was kneaded, it</b> must <b>be prepared in purity.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: <b>Before it was kneaded it may be prepared</b> even <b>in</b> definite <b>impurity</b> because <b>it is non-sacred</b> food, <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that it is <b>permitted to cause impurity to non-sacred food in Eretz Yisrael. After it was kneaded it</b> must <b>be prepared in purity,</b> since <b>non-sacred</b> food <b>that is untithed with regard to</b> the obligation to separate <b><i>ḥalla</i>,</b> i.e., its <i>ḥalla</i> has not yet been separated, <b>is considered like <i>ḥalla</i>, and</b> it is <b>prohibited to cause impurity to <i>ḥalla</i>.</b>
It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:

Daf 7a

<b>And</b> as the <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> of this kneaded, untithed dough is in a state of uncertain purity, its status is <b>suspended:</b> It is <b>neither eaten</b> like ritually pure <i>ḥalla</i>, <b>nor</b> is it <b>burned</b> like impure <i>ḥalla</i>. <b>With regard to which</b> uncertainty did <b>they state</b> this <i>halakha</i>? <b>With regard to <i>ḥalla</i></b> of <b>uncertain</b> status. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the concept of <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> of <b>uncertain</b> status? This apparently indicates a scenario of possible ritual impurity that applies specifically to <i>ḥalla</i>, not to non-sacred food.
<b>Abaye and Rava both say: One should not say</b> that <b>we learned</b> this case of <i>ḥalla</i> of uncertain status among the cases of equal <b>proofs,</b> i.e., an unresolvable uncertainty, <b>such as</b> the case of <b>two paths,</b> where someone walked down one of two paths, one of which was ritually impure and the other ritually pure, and he does not remember which one he walked down. <b>As there,</b> even <b>regular non-sacred</b> food is <b>also rendered</b> ritually <b>impure</b> due to uncertainty.
<b>Rather,</b> the uncertainty referred to here is similar to the less likely case <b>of leaning, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zavim</i> 3:2): In a case of <b>a <i>zav</i> and a ritually pure</b> person <b>who were unloading</b> a package <b>from a donkey or</b> who were <b>loading</b> a package onto a donkey, <b>when their package</b> is <b>heavy</b> the pure person is rendered <b>impure,</b> as perhaps the <i>zav</i> leaned on him while they handled the package together. If <b>their package</b> is <b>light,</b> he remains <b>pure. And</b> in <b>all those</b> cases, he remains ritually <b>pure</b> even if he is one of the <b>members of a synagogue</b> whose congregants handle non-sacred food according to the standards of sacrificial food, as this is not a true case of a <i>zav</i> moving a pure person. <b>But</b> he is <b>impure with regard to</b> matters involving <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> by rabbinic law.
The Gemara asks: <b>And is non-sacred</b> food <b>that is untithed with regard to</b> the obligation to separate <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> really <b>considered like <i>ḥalla</i></b> to the extent that it is rendered impure even in a case of leaning? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a woman who immersed that day</b> and is waiting for nightfall for the purification process to be completed, she may separate <i>ḥalla</i>: <b>She may knead the dough, and separate its <i>ḥalla</i> from it, and place</b> the separated dough <b>into a wicker basket or a wooden board [<i>be’anḥuta</i>], and</b> subsequently she may <b>bring</b> it <b>near</b> the rest of the dough, <b>and</b> she may then <b>designate it</b> <i>ḥalla</i> <b>by name.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: The reason that this is allowed, despite her impurity, is <b>because</b> the dough <b>is</b> impure by <b>third</b>-degree ritual impurity, <b>and</b> an item that has <b>third</b>-degree impurity is considered <b>pure with regard to non-sacred</b> food. The Gemara concludes its question: <b>And if you say</b> that <b>non-sacred</b> food <b>that is untithed with regard to</b> the obligation to separate <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> is <b>considered like <i>ḥalla</i>,</b> then she should <b>render it impure</b> with her touch, just as she would render actual <i>ḥalla</i> impure.
<b>Abaye says:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> item <b>that</b> when it is <b>definitely</b> impure <b>renders non-sacred</b> food <b>impure,</b> as in the case of the <i>zav</i>, the Sages <b>issued a decree</b> that <b>its uncertain</b> impurity should also render non-sacred food items impure, <b>due to</b> its status as <b>non-sacred</b> food <b>that is untithed with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>. But</b> with regard to <b>this</b> case of <b>one who immersed that day, since</b> even when she is <b>definitely</b> impure she <b>does not render non-sacred food impure, they did not issue a decree</b> that she should render that dough impure <b>due to</b> its status as <b>non-sacred</b> food <b>that is untithed with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> what about the twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> of retroactive impurity <b>of a menstruating woman? As a definitely</b> impure menstruating woman <b>renders non-sacred</b> food <b>impure and</b> nevertheless with regard to untithed dough the Sages <b>did not issue a decree</b> to treat <b>her uncertain</b> impurity as definite impurity <b>due to</b> the dough’s status as <b>non-sacred</b> food <b>that is untithed with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>.</b>
The Gemara cites its source for this claim: <b>As the Master said: Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak received</b> from Rav Naḥman: The retroactive impurity of a menstruating woman transmits impurity <b>to non-sacred</b> food items <b>that were prepared according to</b> the standards of <b>purity of sacrificial</b> food, <b>but not to non-sacred</b> food items <b>that were prepared</b> according to the standards of <b>purity of <i>teruma</i>.</b> It is assumed that the level of purity required for non-sacred food items prepared according to the standards required of <i>teruma</i> is the same as that of dough from which <i>ḥalla</i> has not been separated, i.e., it is not treated as real <i>ḥalla</i>, which is rendered impure by her retroactive twenty-four-hour period of impurity.
The Gemara answers: The level of purity required for non-sacred food items that were prepared according to the standards of purity of <i>teruma</i> is actually lower than the level required for dough from which <i>ḥalla</i> has not been separated. The reason is that <b>there,</b> in the case of non-sacred food items, there is <b>no</b> actual <b><i>teruma</i> mixed in it.</b> By contrast, <b>here,</b> in the case of untithed dough, there is <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> i.e., <i>ḥalla</i>, <b>mixed in it,</b> which will eventually be separated from this dough.
<b>If you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Leave</b> aside the twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> of retroactive impurity of a menstruating woman, as it applies <b>by rabbinic law.</b> One cannot raise a difficulty against the principle that untithed dough is treated with the same level of purity as <i>ḥalla</i> from the case of the retroactive impurity of a menstruating woman, since that retroactive impurity is a rabbinic decree, and therefore there is more room for leniency.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> Unlike the women with regard to whom it was taught that they transmit impurity retroactively, there are <b>four women</b> who discern menstrual blood and <b>their time is sufficient,</b> i.e., they transmit impurity only from the moment that they saw the blood: <b>A virgin, a pregnant woman, a nursing woman, and an elderly woman. Rabbi Yehoshua says: I heard</b> this <i>halakha</i> from my teachers <b>only</b> with regard to <b>a virgin,</b>

Daf 7b

<b>but</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b>
<b>Who is</b> the woman characterized as <b>a virgin</b> in this context? It is <b>any</b> woman <b>who has not seen</b> the flow of menstrual <b>blood in all her days, even if she was married</b> and has experienced bleeding as a result of intercourse consummating her marriage. The time of <b>a pregnant woman</b> is <b>from</b> the point in her pregnancy when the existence of <b>her fetus is known</b> to all who see her. The time of <b>a nursing woman</b> is <b>until she weans her child</b> from nursing. If she stopped nursing, e.g., <b>she gave her child to a wet nurse, weaned him</b> from nursing, <b>or</b> her child <b>died,</b> and she saw menstrual blood, <b>Rabbi Meir says: She transmits impurity for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> or from her most recent examination. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> Even in those cases, <b>her time is sufficient.</b>
<b>Who is</b> the woman characterized as <b>an elderly woman</b> in this context? It is <b>any</b> woman for <b>whom three</b> typical menstrual <b>cycles</b> of thirty days <b>passed</b> during which she saw no menstrual blood, at a stage of her life <b>close to her old age. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> In the case of <b>any woman</b> for <b>whom three</b> typical menstrual <b>cycles passed</b> during which she saw no menstrual blood, if she then experiences bleeding, <b>her time is sufficient. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> With regard to <b>a pregnant woman and a nursing woman</b> for <b>whom three</b> typical menstrual <b>cycles passed</b> during which they saw no menstrual blood, if they then saw blood, <b>their time is sufficient.</b>
<b>And</b> in the above cases, <b>with regard to what did</b> the <i>tanna</i> say <b>her time is sufficient?</b> It is <b>with regard to the first sighting</b> of blood, <b>but with regard to the second sighting,</b> her status is like that of any other woman, and <b>she transmits impurity for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> or from her most recent examination. <b>And if she saw the first</b> sighting as a result of <b>unnatural circumstances, even</b> with regard to <b>the second</b> sighting, the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>her time is sufficient.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> Rabbi Eliezer teaches in the mishna that there are four women who transmit impurity only from the moment that they saw menstrual blood, not retroactively. Rabbi Yehoshua said: I heard this <i>halakha</i> from my teachers only with regard to a virgin. The Gemara notes that <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer said to Rabbi Yehoshua: You did not hear,</b> but <b>I did hear</b> it. In other words, you may not have received a tradition from your teachers with regard to any other woman, but I did receive such a tradition. Furthermore, <b>you heard</b> a halakhic ruling with regard to <b>only one</b> woman, <b>and I heard</b> rulings with regard to <b>many</b> women.
Rabbi Eliezer continued his rebuttal with a metaphor from the practice of sanctifying the new moon, which required the testimony of witnesses: <b>We do not say to one who had not seen the new moon</b> to <b>come and testify. Rather</b> we give such an instruction only <b>to he who saw it.</b> Similarly, my opinion is weightier with regard to this issue, as I heard many rulings about the matter, whereas you did not. The Gemara reports: <b>All the days of</b> the life of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, they would practice in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> i.e., only a virgin would be exempt from retroactive impurity. <b>After Rabbi Eliezer’s passing, Rabbi Yehoshua returned the matter to its former</b> custom, which was to follow the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that they <b>did not</b> act <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer during his lifetime?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Because Rabbi Eliezer was a <i>Shammuti</i>,</b> i.e., a follower of the rulings of Beit Shammai, and the <i>halakha</i> is generally in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel in their disputes with Beit Shammai. <b>And</b> the Sages <b>held</b> that <b>if we act in accordance with his</b> opinion <b>in one</b> matter, people will <b>act in accordance with his</b> opinion <b>in other</b> matters.
<b>And</b> that would be a problem, as if so, then during his lifetime, <b>due to the honor of Rabbi Eliezer, we</b> will <b>not be able to protest</b> against <b>them.</b> But <b>after Rabbi Eliezer’s passing, when we are able to protest</b> against <b>those</b> who act in accordance with Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion in other matters, Rabbi Yehoshua <b>returned the matter to its former</b> custom of deciding the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer in this matter.
§ The Gemara mentions other instances in which the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer in four</b> cases. <b>One</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>that we</b> just <b>mentioned,</b> of the four women who transmit ritual impurity only from the time of their sighting and onward.
<b>And another</b> is taught in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a woman <b>who</b> experiences <b>labor</b> pain as a result of which she sees a flow of blood. Her discharge is attributed to childbirth rather than <i>zava</i> blood. The <i>baraita</i> asks: For <b>how long</b> must she be <b>relieved</b> from pain in order <b>to be</b> considered <b>a <i>zava</i></b> due to her flow of uterine blood? She must have relief <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. And</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with his statement.</b>
<b>And another</b> case in which the <i>halakha</i> follows Rabbi Eliezer is taught in a mishna (68b): A <i>zav</i> and a <i>zava</i> must observe seven days without a discharge in order to attain ritual purity. With regard to <b>a <i>zav</i> or a <i>zava</i> who examined themselves</b> on the <b>first day and found</b> themselves to be <b>pure,</b> and they examined themselves on the <b>seventh day and found</b> themselves to be <b>pure, but</b> on the <b>rest of the</b> intervening <b>days they did not examine</b> themselves, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The presumptive status of</b> the <i>zav</i> and the <i>zava</i> is one of <b>ritual purity. Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> In that case, the <i>zav</i> and the <i>zava</i> <b>have</b> counted <b>only the first day and the seventh day,</b> two of the seven clean days, and they must count another five days to complete the tally.
The mishna continues: <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> Since any impure discharge that they might have experienced in between the first and seventh days would negate their count and require them to restart the seven-day period, the <i>zav</i> and the <i>zava</i> <b>have</b> counted <b>only the seventh day,</b> and must count another six days to complete the tally. And with regard to this dispute, it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Yosei say: The statement of Rabbi Eliezer appears</b> more correct <b>than the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua, and the statement of Rabbi Akiva</b> appears more correct <b>than the statement of all of them. But</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b>
<b>And the other</b> case in which the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 8:7): With regard to <b>the exterior of vessels that contracted ritual impurity</b> through contact <b>with</b> impure <b>liquids,</b> i.e., with liquids that had touched the carcass of a creeping animal, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says,</b> with regard to this impurity that applies by rabbinic law: These exteriors <b>transmit impurity to liquids</b> that come in contact with them, but <b>they do not disqualify foods</b> with which they come into contact. The mishna elaborates: <b>They transmit impurity to</b> other <b>liquids, and even non-sacred</b> liquids. <b>And they do not disqualify foods, and even <i>teruma</i>. Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> These exteriors <b>transmit impurity to liquids and they disqualify</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>foods,</b> as well.
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> I derived my ruling via <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference from the <i>halakha</i> of one who was ritually impure, who immersed that day and is waiting for nightfall for the purification process to be completed. <b>And if one who immersed that day, who</b> has second-degree ritual impurity status and therefore he <b>does not transmit impurity to non-sacred liquids,</b> nevertheless <b>disqualifies <i>teruma</i> foods</b> with which he comes into contact, then with regard to the <b>exteriors of vessels, which</b> do <b>transmit impurity to non-sacred liquids, is it not logical that</b> they should <b>render <i>teruma</i> food disqualified?</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Eliezer,</b> how does he refute this inference? The Gemara answers: He would counter that the <i>halakha</i> that the <b>exterior of vessels</b> are rendered impure through contact with impure foods or liquids is <b>by rabbinic law, and</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>one who immersed that day</b> apply <b>by Torah law. And</b> there is a principle that one does not <b>apply <i>a fortiori</i></b> inferences to derive conclusions <b>by rabbinic law from</b> cases that apply <b>by Torah law. As by Torah law</b> impure <b>foods do not transmit impurity to vessels, and</b> similarly, impure <b>liquids do not transmit impurity to vessels.</b>
The Gemara continues: <b>And</b> it was <b>the Sages who issued a decree</b> that the exterior of a vessel is rendered impure when it comes into contact with impure liquids, and they decreed that only liquids, not foods, are rendered impure when they come into contact with impure vessel exteriors. The reason for this is <b>due to</b> the <b>liquids</b> secreted <b>by a <i>zav</i> or <i>zava</i>,</b> e.g., their saliva and urine, which have a primary degree of ritual impurity and therefore transmit impurity to vessels. Consequently, with regard to <b>liquids, which are apt to contract impurity, the Sages issued a decree that they</b> contract impurity when they come in contact with these impure vessel exteriors. But with regard to <b>foods, which are not</b> as <b>apt to contract impurity,</b> as they must first be rendered susceptible to impurity through contact with a liquid, <b>the Sages did not issue</b> such <b>a decree with regard to them.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: Rabbi Eliezer agrees that if the interior of a vessel is rendered impure by contact with impure liquids, it renders impure any <i>teruma</i> foods that come into contact with it. <b>But what is different</b> about the <b>exterior of vessels, that</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>cited</b> them as having a more lenient status? The Gemara answers: This is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> their <i>halakhot</i> are more <b>lenient</b> than those of the other parts of the vessel. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 25:6): With regard to <b>a vessel whose exterior was rendered impure by</b> contact with impure <b>liquids,</b> its <b>exterior is impure,</b> while its others parts, such as <b>its interior, its ear,</b> i.e., its looped handle, <b>its rim,</b> the edge of the vessel that protrudes outward, and <b>its handles, are pure.</b> But if its <b>interior was rendered impure, it is all impure.</b>
These are the four cases with regard to which Shmuel said that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer. The Gemara asks: <b>What is Shmuel teaching us? In all</b> of these cases <b>we learned</b> explicitly that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer.
<b>And if you would say</b> that he is <b>teaching us</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>exterior of vessels, whose</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>we did not learn</b> from the mishna, <b>let</b> Shmuel simply <b>state</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer with regard to</b> the <b>exterior of vessels.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Rather, this</b> is what Shmuel <b>teaches us: That</b> a final <b><i>halakha</i> may not be learned</b> directly <b>from the Talmud,</b> i.e., from a statement of a mishna or <i>baraita</i> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with a specific opinion, unless the ruling is confirmed by <i>amora’im</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>And is there nothing more</b> that can be added to the list of cases in which the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer? <b>But isn’t there</b> another case <b>that we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Yevamot</i> 109a): Two brothers married two sisters, one an adult and the other a minor. If the husband of the adult dies, the Torah obligation of levirate marriage applies to the other brother, which is not abrogated by the rabbinic prohibition of the <i>yevama</i> as the sister of his minor wife. In such a case, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b>

Daf 8a

<b>We instruct the minor,</b> i.e., the surviving brother’s wife, <b>to refuse</b> to continue to stay married to <b>him</b> so that her marriage is dissolved, and he may then enter into levirate marriage with her adult sister, the widow of his childless brother. <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>When Shmuel says</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer in four</b> cases, what he meant was four cases <b>within <i>Seder Teharot</i></b> in the Mishna, the order that deals with ritual purity. <b>But in the other orders, there are many</b> instances where the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer.
The Gemara adds: <b>This too stands to reason, as we learned</b> in a mishna in the order of <i>Zera’im</i> (<i>Ḥalla</i> 2:4) that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Even</b> with regard to <b>one who removes</b> loaves of bread from an oven <b>and places them in a basket, the basket</b> serves to <b>combine them to</b> reach the quantity from which one is required to separate <b><i>ḥalla</i>,</b> despite the fact that each of the loaves does not contain the necessary measure for <i>ḥalla</i> on its own. <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer. Conclude from this</b> that Shmuel’s general statement applies only to <i>Seder Teharot</i>.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: The case of <i>ḥalla</i> was cited as proof that there is an exception to Shmuel’s principle that there are only four cases where the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, after a difficulty was raised from the case of levirate marriage with the sister of one’s minor wife. <b>But</b> in <b>what</b> way is <b>this</b> case of <i>ḥalla</i> <b>greater</b> proof <b>than that</b> case of the levirate marriage? Neither case appears in <i>Seder Teharot</i>. The Gemara answers: The case of the levirate marriage is different, <b>as</b> there <b>Rabbi Elazar holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer.
<b>As we learned</b> in the mishna (<i>Yevamot</i> 111b): A <i>yavam</i> may perform levirate marriage with only one of his deceased brother’s wives. Once he does so, the other wives are forbidden to him, because they had been married to his brother. If a deceased brother had two wives, an adult and a minor, and the <i>yavam</i> engaged in sexual intercourse with the minor and then engaged in intercourse with the adult, the Rabbis maintain that he disqualifies the minor from staying married to him, as her levirate bond is uncertain, and the adult wife is also prohibited to him, because the levirate marriage with the minor is considered effective by rabbinic law. <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The court <b>instructs the minor to refuse him,</b> thereby annulling her marriage retroactively, and he may then perform levirate marriage with the adult. Accordingly, the case of <i>ḥalla</i> is a stronger example, as there the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer exclusively, as his opinion is not supported by another <i>tanna</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>And does</b> Rabbi Elazar in fact <b>hold</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer? <b>But doesn’t</b> the Gemara (<i>Yevamot</i> 111b) explain that both the opinions of Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Elazar <b>are necessary,</b> as they apply to different cases, <b>and</b> therefore <b>they are not comparable to each other?</b> The Gemara suggests a new answer: <b>Rather,</b> the ruling with regard to levirate marriage is a weaker example of a case where the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer <b>because Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava holds in accordance with his opinion.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava testified</b> about <b>five matters of</b> <i>halakha</i>: Normally, marriage refusals of girls married off by their mother or brothers are discouraged. Yet, in specific instances where it is clear that if the marriage were to remain in effect it would engender problems related to levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i>, the court <b>persuades minor girls to refuse</b> to continue living with their husbands, thereby resolving the complications involved in the case.
<b>And</b> he also testified <b>that one may</b> allow <b>a woman</b> who seeks to remarry after hearing of her husband’s death <b>to marry based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness,</b> as opposed to the two witnesses required for other matters of testimony. <b>And</b> he further testified <b>that a rooster was stoned</b> to death <b>in Jerusalem for killing a person,</b> in order to teach that the Torah law requiring the stoning of an ox that killed a person (see Exodus 21:28) applies to other animals as well. <b>And</b> he testified <b>about forty-day-old wine that was</b> used for <b>libation on the altar. And</b> finally, he testified <b>about</b> the <b>daily morning offering that was sacrificed at four hours</b> of the day.
The Gemara concludes its proof: When the <i>baraita</i> teaches that Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava testified that the court persuades minor girls to refuse to continue living with their husbands, <b>what</b> is the significance of the reference to <b>minor girls</b> in the plural? Is this <b>not</b> referring to the <b>one</b> minor girl who is the subject of the ruling <b>of Rabbi Elazar and</b> the other <b>one</b> that is the subject of the ruling <b>of Rabbi Eliezer?</b> Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer in the case of the minor’s refusal. If so, this ruling is a weaker proof that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer in cases outside of <i>Seder Teharot</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>No, what</b> is meant by the plural: <b>Minor girls?</b> It means <b>minor girls in general,</b> i.e., all minor girls in such cases where the ruling of Rabbi Elazar applies.
The Gemara challenges: <b>If so, with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> listed in the <i>baraita</i> that one may allow <b>a woman</b> to marry based on the testimony of one witness, <b>let it also teach: Women,</b> in the plural, <b>and we will say</b> that it is referring to <b>women in general. Rather, from</b> the fact that <b>here</b> it <b>teaches: A woman, and</b> yet <b>here</b> it <b>teaches: Minor girls, conclude from</b> this discrepancy that Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava <b>is teaching</b> his ruling <b>specifically</b> about two minor girls: The one who is the subject of Rabbi Elazar’s ruling and the one who is the subject of Rabbi Eliezer’s ruling. The Gemara comments: Indeed, <b>conclude from it</b> that Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer.
§ <b>And similarly, Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer in four</b> cases. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> are there <b>no more? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The court <b>instructs the minor to refuse</b> to stay married to <b>him, and Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer?</b> The Gemara adds: <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>when Rabbi Elazar said</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer in four</b> cases, he meant four cases <b>within <i>Seder Teharot</i>, but in the other orders</b> of the Mishna <b>there are many</b> cases, <b>are there</b> really other such cases?
<b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 7:6) that the <i>halakha</i> of the following fragrant plants: <b>The rose, the henna, the rockrose, and the balsam,</b> is that <b>they have</b> the sanctity of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>and money</b> exchanged for <b>them has</b> the sanctity of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year. Additionally, <b>they have</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>eradication and money</b> exchanged for <b>them has</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>eradication. And</b> with regard to this mishna, <b>Rabbi Pedat said: Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught that balsam</b> has the status of <b>a fruit,</b> and is not merely sap, and therefore it has the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year? It is <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b>
The Gemara continues: <b>And Rabbi Zeira said to</b> Rabbi Pedat: One can <b>see that from you and from your father,</b> i.e., between the two of you, <b>you have permitted balsam to the world,</b> since the ruling of Rabbi Eliezer is certainly not accepted. As <b>you said: Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught that balsam</b> has the status of <b>a fruit?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Eliezer. And your father,</b> Rabbi Elazar, <b>said</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer in</b> only <b>four</b> cases.
The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>And if it is so,</b> that Rabbi Elazar was referring only to <i>Seder Teharot</i>, then <b>let</b> Rabbi Pedat <b>say to</b> Rabbi Zeira: <b>When</b> my <b>father said</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer in four</b> cases, he meant only four cases <b>within <i>Seder Teharot</i>, but in the other orders there are</b> other such cases. From the fact that Rabbi Pedat did not reply in this manner, evidently there are no cases in the other orders of the Mishna where, according to Rabbi Elazar, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer.
The Gemara asks: <b>But that</b> case, where the <i>amora</i> Rabbi Elazar said that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer with regard to persuading a minor to refuse to stay married to her husband, is <b>difficult.</b> This apparently conflicts with the statement that there are only four cases in which Rabbi Elazar rules in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer. The Gemara answers: There the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer only <b>because</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>Rabbi Elazar holds in accordance with his</b> opinion. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna that <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The court <b>instructs the minor to refuse</b> to stay married to <b>him,</b> thereby annulling her marriage retroactively.
The Gemara asks: <b>And does</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>hold</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer in that case of the minor? <b>But doesn’t</b> the Gemara in <i>Yevamot</i> explain that both the opinions of Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Elazar <b>are necessary, and</b> therefore <b>they are not comparable to each other? Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer in that case <b>because Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava holds in accordance with his opinion,</b> as explained earlier.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> are there <b>no more</b> cases in which Rabbi Elazar maintains that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Rabbi Eliezer? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Berakhot</i> 33a): One recites the prayer of distinction between the holy and the profane [<i>havdala</i>], said in the evening prayer following Shabbat and festivals, in the fourth blessing of the <i>Amida</i> prayer: Who graciously grants knowledge. <b>Rabbi Akiva says: One recites</b> <i>havdala</i> as <b>a fourth blessing by itself. Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that <b>one recites it in</b> the blessing of <b>thanksgiving.</b> And with regard to this dispute, <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b>
<b>Rabbi Abba said,</b> in explanation: <b>That</b> case is different, <b>as</b> that is not the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer himself. Rather, he <b>stated</b> that ruling <b>in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva says: One recites</b> <i>havdala</i> as <b>a fourth blessing by itself; Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel says: One recites it in</b> the blessing of <b>thanksgiving.</b>

Daf 8b

The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> wasn’t Rabbi Eliezer <b>much older than</b> Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel? How could Rabbi Eliezer have cited the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel? The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the reason Rabbi Elazar ruled that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer in that case was <b>because Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel held in accordance with his</b> opinion.
<b>And does</b> Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel really <b>hold</b> in accordance with Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: On <b>the night of Yom Kippur, one prays seven</b> blessings in the <i>Amida</i> prayer <b>and confesses;</b> in the <b>morning prayer, one prays seven</b> blessings <b>and confesses;</b> in the <b>additional prayer, one prays seven</b> blessings <b>and confesses;</b> in the <b>afternoon prayer, one prays seven</b> blessings <b>and confesses;</b> and <b>in</b> the <b><i>ne’ila</i> prayer, one</b> also <b>prays seven</b> blessings <b>and confesses. For the evening prayer</b> at the conclusion of Yom Kippur, <b>one prays seven</b> blessings in <b>an abridged</b> version of the <b>eighteen</b> blessings of the weekday <i>Amida</i> prayer. One recites the first three blessings, the final three, and a middle blessing that includes an abbreviated form of the other weekday blessings.
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel says in the name of his forefathers: One recites</b> the complete <b>eighteen</b> blessings, <b>due to</b> the fact that he is <b>required to recite <i>havdala</i> in</b> the fourth blessing of the <i>Amida</i>: <b>Who graciously grants knowledge.</b> <i>Havdala</i> cannot be inserted into the abridged version. Evidently, Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel does not agree with Rabbi Eliezer’s ruling that one recites <i>havdala</i> in the blessing of thanksgiving, one of the final three blessings of the <i>Amida</i> prayer. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says</b> in explanation: Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel <b>said</b> this opinion <b>in the name of his forefathers, but</b> he <b>himself does not hold accordingly.</b>
§ Earlier, Rabbi Zeira questioned the claim of Rabbi Pedat, son of Rabbi Eliezer, that the Sage who holds that balsam is considered to be fruit and therefore has the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year is Rabbi Eliezer. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Zeira: And you? Do you not hold</b> that the <i>tanna</i> <b>who taught</b> that <b>balsam</b> sap has the status of <b>fruit is Rabbi Eliezer? As, didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 1:7) that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to <b>one who curdles</b> cheese <b>in the sap of <i>orla</i>,</b> the cheese is <b>prohibited,</b> as the sap is considered to be fruit of the tree.
The Gemara answers: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna that deals with balsam is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> As <b>the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Eliezer only with regard to</b> the <b>sap of the tree, but in</b> the case of the <b>sap of the fruit they agree with him. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 1:7) that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said: I heard explicitly that</b> in the case of <b>one who curdles</b> cheese <b>in the sap of the leaves</b> or <b>the sap of the roots</b> of an <i>orla</i> tree, the cheese is <b>permitted.</b> But if it is curdled <b>in the sap of unripe figs it is prohibited, because</b> that sap <b>is</b> considered to be <b>fruit.</b>
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>When the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Eliezer,</b> it is <b>with regard to a tree that bears fruit. But in</b> the case of <b>a tree that does not bear fruit, they agree that its sap is</b> considered to be <b>its fruit. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 7:6) that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The sanctity of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year <b>does not</b> apply <b>to sap. And the Rabbis say:</b> The sanctity of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year <b>does</b> apply <b>to sap, because its sap is its fruit.</b>
The Gemara explains the proof: <b>Who</b> are these <b>Rabbis?</b> Are they <b>not the Rabbis who disagree with Rabbi Eliezer?</b> If so, this demonstrates that they agree in the case of a tree that does not bear fruit. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>A certain elder said to</b> Rabbi Zeira that <b>this is what Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Who</b> are <b>the Rabbis</b> in this mishna? It is <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who said</b> that <b>its sap is</b> considered to be <b>its fruit.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If it is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, why</b> are they <b>specifically</b> discussing the case of <b>a tree that does not bear fruit? Even</b> in the case of <b>a tree that</b> does <b>bear fruit,</b> Rabbi Eliezer maintains that <b>its sap is</b> like <b>its fruit.</b> The Gemara answers: Rabbi Eliezer <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>to them in accordance with the statement of the Rabbis</b> themselves, as follows: <b>According to my</b> opinion, <b>even</b> with regard to <b>a tree that bears fruit, its sap</b> is <b>also</b> considered to be <b>its fruit.</b> But <b>according to your</b> opinion, you should <b>at least agree with me in</b> the case of <b>a tree that does not bear fruit,</b> that <b>its sap is</b> considered to be <b>its fruit. And the Rabbis said</b> in response <b>to</b> Rabbi Eliezer: <b>It is no different.</b> Sap is not considered fruit whether it comes from a fruit-bearing tree or a barren tree.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Who is</b> the woman characterized as <b>a virgin</b> in this context? It is <b>any</b> woman <b>who did not see</b> the flow of menstrual blood in all her days, even if she was married and experienced bleeding resulting from intercourse consummating her marriage. <b>The Sages taught:</b> If she was <b>married and she saw</b> a flow of <b>blood due to her marriage,</b> i.e., blood resulting from the tearing of her hymen; or if <b>she gave birth and saw blood due to the birth, I still call her a virgin</b> in this context. The reason is <b>that when they said: Virgin</b> here, they meant a menstrual <b>blood virgin,</b> i.e., one who did not yet see a menstrual flow, <b>and not a hymen-</b>blood <b>virgin,</b> i.e., one who did not experience bleeding from a torn hymen.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rav Kahana say</b> that a Sage <b>taught: There are three</b> types of <b>virgins: A virgin human, virgin ground, and a virgin sycamore. A virgin human</b> is a woman for <b>as long as she has not engaged in intercourse. The relevance</b> of this designation is that only a virgin is permitted <b>to</b> marry <b>a High Priest</b> (see Leviticus 21:13–14). <b>Alternatively,</b> the relevance is <b>that her marriage contract is two hundred dinars,</b> instead of the one hundred dinars in the marriage contract of a non-virgin.
<b>Virgin ground</b> is ground for <b>as long as it has not been worked. The relevance</b> of this designation is <b>with regard to</b> the <b>rough</b> dried-up <b>stream</b> mentioned in the Torah. When the corpse of a murder victim is found between two towns and the murderer is unknown, the Torah states that a heifer’s neck is broken in a place that was not worked. <b>Alternatively,</b> the relevance is <b>with regard to buying and selling.</b> If one stipulates that he is buying virgin land, it is defined as land that has never been worked.
Finally, <b>a virgin sycamore</b> is a sycamore for <b>as long as it has not been felled,</b> i.e., cut to promote growth. <b>The relevance</b> of this designation is <b>with regard to buying and selling.</b> If one stipulates that he is buying virgin sycamore, it is defined as one that has never been felled. <b>Alternatively,</b> the relevance is <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition against <b>felling it in the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: (<i>Shevi’it</i> 4:5): <b>One may not fell a virgin sycamore in the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>because it is</b> considered <b>work,</b> as this promotes the growth of the tree. The Gemara explains its question: <b>And if it is so,</b> that there is a concept of a virgin from menstrual blood, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i> <b>also teach this</b> type of virgin.
The Gemara cites several answers. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: When</b> the Sage <b>teaches</b> the list of virgins, he includes only <b>an item that does not have a modifier, but he does not teach an item that has a modifier.</b> A virgin human, virgin land, and a virgin sycamore can be referred to without another modifier. Conversely, a virgin with regard to menstrual blood cannot be referred to simply by the unmodified term: Virgin. <b>Rav Sheshet, son of Rav Idi, says: When</b> the Sage <b>teaches</b> the list of virgins, he includes only <b>an item that is dependent upon</b> an outside <b>action,</b> e.g., intercourse in the case of a human virgin or felling in the case of a virgin sycamore. But <b>he does not teach an item that is not dependent upon</b> an outside <b>action,</b> such as a woman’s menstrual flow.
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina, son of Rav Ika says: When</b> the Sage <b>teaches</b> the list of virgins, he includes only <b>an item that will not</b> later <b>revert to its</b> original <b>state.</b> But <b>he does not teach an item</b> that will later <b>revert to its</b> original <b>state,</b> such as a woman’s menstrual flow that ceases when she reaches old age. <b>Ravina says: When</b> the Sage <b>teaches</b> the list of virgins, he includes only <b>an item about which a buyer is particular,</b> such as one who purchases a virgin sycamore tree. But <b>he does not teach an item about which a buyer is not particular,</b> e.g., a woman’s menstrual blood.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is a buyer, i.e., a potential husband, <b>not particular</b> about her menstrual blood? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya says: Just as leaven is fortuitous for dough, so</b> too, <b>blood is fortuitous for a woman; and it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> <b>in the name of Rabbi Meir: Any woman whose blood is plentiful, her children are plentiful?</b> A potential husband would certainly be particular about this factor. The Gemara provides an alternative answer: <b>Rather, when</b> the Sage <b>teaches</b> the list of virgins, he includes only <b>an item that buyers are eager</b> to purchase. But <b>he does not teach an item that buyers are not eager</b> to purchase, e.g., a woman without menstrual blood.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is virgin ground?</b> It is <b>any</b> ground <b>that raises up hard clumps</b> of <b>earth and whose dirt is not loose.</b> If one <b>finds</b> a shard of <b>earthenware in</b> the earth, <b>it is</b> thereby <b>known that it was</b> once <b>worked</b> and is not virgin ground. If one finds hard <b>rock, it is virgin ground.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: The time of <b>a pregnant woman</b> is sufficient <b>from</b> the point in her pregnancy when the existence of <b>her fetus is known</b> to all who see her. The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> time must pass for <b>the fetus to be known? Sumakhos says in the name of Rabbi Meir: Three months. And although there is no</b> explicit <b>proof for the matter,</b> that a fetus is discernable after three months of pregnancy, there is <b>an allusion to the matter, as it is stated: “And it came to pass about three months</b> after, that it was told to Judah, saying: Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot” (Genesis 38:24).
The Gemara asks: Why does Rabbi Meir call this a mere <b>allusion to the matter?</b> An explicit <b>verse is written, and that is a significant proof.</b> The Gemara answers: It is only an allusion <b>because there are</b> some women <b>who give birth after nine</b> months <b>and there are</b> others <b>who give birth after seven</b> months. Although the verse indicates that a fetus is known to all after three months, it is possible that this applies only to a nine-month pregnancy. Since in the case of a nine-month pregnancy the fetus is recognizable after a third of the full term, with regard to a seven-month pregnancy, the fetus would likewise be noticeable after a third of the full pregnancy, i.e., at two and one-third months. Therefore, Rabbi Meir teaches that in all cases the fetus is known only after three months.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a woman who <b>had a presumptive status that</b> she was <b>pregnant and she saw blood, and afterward</b> she <b>miscarried air, or anything that is not a viable</b> fetus, <b>she</b> retains <b>her presumptive status, and</b> therefore <b>her time is sufficient</b> from that flow of blood, i.e., it renders her impure only from then on, not retroactively, as even a non-viable fetus gives her full pregnancy status.
<b>And even though there is no</b> explicit <b>proof for</b> this <b>matter,</b> that even a pregnancy that ends in a miscarriage is like a full-fledged pregnancy, there is <b>an allusion to the matter, as it is stated: “We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind”</b> (Isaiah 26:18). This verse indicates that even one who miscarries wind is considered as having been with child. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the reason that this is called a mere <b>allusion to the matter?</b> This explicit verse <b>is a significant proof.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>When that verse was written,</b> it was <b>written with regard to males</b> as bearing children. The allusion to child-bearing in the verse is symbolic, so halakhic inferences may not be drawn from it.
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman experienced <b>labor</b> pain for <b>two</b> days, during which she saw a discharge of blood, <b>and on the third</b> day <b>she miscarried air or anything that is not a viable</b> fetus, <b>that</b> woman <b>gives birth as a <i>zava</i>,</b> and the blood is treated as blood of a <i>zava</i> in all regards. The Gemara explains the contradiction: <b>And if you say</b> that miscarrying a non-viable fetus <b>is</b> considered <b>a proper birth,</b> this is problematic,

Daf 9a

as with regard to blood emitted while experiencing <b>labor</b> pain <b>close to</b> the time of a proper <b>birth, the Merciful One deems it pure,</b> and it should not be treated as the blood of a <i>zava</i>. <b>Rav Pappi says:</b> The miscarriage is not considered a proper birth and therefore her blood is considered the blood of a <i>zava</i>. And <b>leave</b> aside the first <i>baraita</i> and do not raise a contradiction from it, as the <i>halakha</i> that a woman who sees menstrual blood is retroactively impure <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period,</b> which is the topic under discussion in that <i>baraita</i>, applies <b>by rabbinic law,</b> and they did not impose this stringency in the case of a woman who miscarries.
<b>Rav Pappa says: That reason</b> for the <i>halakha</i> that a pregnant woman is not retroactively impure when she experiences bleeding is <b>only because her head and limbs</b> feel <b>heavy to her.</b> Her physical state is compromised, which also causes her regular menstrual cycle to cease. <b>Here, too,</b> in the case of a pregnancy that precedes a miscarriage, even if it is not considered a proper birth, <b>her head and limbs</b> felt <b>heavy to her</b> during her pregnancy, and therefore it can be assumed that she did not experience a prior menstrual flow.
With regard to the mishna’s ruling that the time of a pregnant woman is sufficient, <b>Rabbi Yirmeya asked Rabbi Zeira:</b> If <b>she saw</b> blood <b>and</b> only <b>afterward her fetus became known</b> to all who see her, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? One can claim that <b>since at the time when she saw</b> the blood <b>her fetus was not</b> yet <b>known,</b> therefore she <b>becomes impure; or perhaps, since she saw</b> blood <b>in close</b> proximity <b>to</b> the time that her fetus became known, she does <b>not become impure.</b>
Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: That reason</b> for the <i>halakha</i> that a pregnant woman’s time is sufficient is <b>only because her head and limbs</b> feel <b>heavy to her.</b> In this case, where she was yet unaware of her pregnancy <b>at the time when she saw</b> her menstrual flow, <b>neither her head nor her limbs</b> felt <b>heavy to her.</b> Therefore she is impure retroactively, like any other woman.
§ <b>A certain elder asked Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> If the <b>time</b> of a woman’s fixed menstrual <b>cycle arrived during her pregnancy and she did not perform an examination, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>I raise</b> this <b>dilemma</b> only <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of the one who said</b> that the obligation for a woman to perform a self-examination during her fixed menstrual <b>cycle</b> applies <b>by Torah law. What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? According to that opinion, one can claim that <b>since</b> the obligation of an examination during one’s fixed menstrual <b>cycle</b> is <b>by Torah law,</b> she is <b>required</b> to perform <b>an examination</b> even during her pregnancy. <b>Or perhaps, since her blood has stopped,</b> as a pregnant woman generally does not experience a flow of menstrual blood, she is <b>not required</b> to perform <b>an examination.</b>
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: You learned</b> the answer to your dilemma from a mishna (39a): <b>Rabbi Meir says: If</b> a woman <b>was in hiding</b> from danger, <b>and the time of her</b> fixed menstrual <b>cycle came and she did not examine</b> herself, nevertheless she is <b>ritually pure, as</b> it may be assumed that she did not experience bleeding because <b>fear dispels</b> the flow of menstrual <b>blood.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan explains the proof: The <b>reason</b> she is pure is <b>that there is fear,</b> from which it may be inferred that in a case where <b>there is no fear and the time of her</b> fixed menstrual <b>cycle arrived and she did not examine</b> herself, she would be <b>impure.</b>
Rabbi Yoḥanan concludes: <b>Evidently,</b> from the fact that Rabbi Meir rules that a woman is impure if the time of her period passed without a proper examination, he maintains that the obligation for a woman to perform an examination at the time of her fixed menstrual <b>cycle</b> applies <b>by Torah law. And,</b> nevertheless, <b>since there is fear, her blood has stopped and</b> she is <b>not required</b> to perform <b>an examination. Here, too,</b> in the case of a pregnant woman, <b>her blood has stopped and</b> therefore she is <b>not required</b> to perform <b>an examination.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: The time of <b>a nursing woman</b> is sufficient <b>until she weans</b> her child from nursing. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (see <i>Tosefta</i> 2:1): With regard to <b>a nursing woman whose child dies within twenty-four months</b> of his birth, <b>she is like all</b> other <b>women</b> with regard to her impurity status after seeing menstrual blood, <b>and</b> therefore <b>she transmits ritual impurity</b> retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period or from examination to examination. Therefore, if</b> a woman <b>continued to nurse</b> her child <b>for four or five years, her time is sufficient</b> and she does not retroactively transmit impurity for the entire four or five years. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon</b> all <b>say:</b> With regard to nursing women, <b>their time is sufficient</b> for <b>an entire twenty-four months. Therefore, if she nursed him for four or five years,</b> then after the first twenty-four months have passed, <b>she transmits ritual impurity</b> retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period or from examination to examination.</b>
The Gemara discusses the reasoning of each opinion: <b>When</b> you analyze the matter <b>you will find</b> that one must <b>say that according to the statement of Rabbi Meir</b> the case is that menstrual <b>blood spoils and becomes milk.</b> Therefore, it follows that this status continues for as long as she is nursing. By contrast, <b>according to the statement of Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon, her limbs become dislocated and her spirit,</b> i.e., her full strength and her regular menstrual cycle, <b>does not return</b> to her <b>until twenty-four months</b> have passed.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the statement <b>of Rabbi Meir: Therefore,</b> if a woman continued to nurse her child for four or five years, her time is sufficient? Since his reasoning is that the menstrual blood of a nursing woman spoils and becomes milk, it is obvious that this applies as long as she continues to nurse him. The Gemara answers: This statement is indeed extraneous. It merely serves to form a parallel between the statement of Rabbi Meir and that of the other Sages. In other words, it was appended <b>due to</b> the statement: <b>Therefore,</b> if she was nursing him for four or five years, then after the first twenty-four months have passed, she transmits ritual impurity retroactively for a twenty-four-hour period or from examination to examination, which is referring to the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei.</b>
The Gemara further asks: <b>And why do I</b> need the statement: <b>Therefore,</b> if she was nursing him for four or five years, then after the first twenty-four months have passed, she transmits ritual impurity retroactively for a twenty-four-hour period or from examination to examination, which is referring to the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei?</b> The Gemara explains that this clause is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that there are <b>two</b> reasons that a pregnant woman’s time is sufficient, both because her blood spoils and because her limbs become dislocated. Therefore, the additional clause <b>teaches us</b> that Rabbi Yosei maintains that the reason is only that her limbs become dislocated, and consequently she transmits retroactive impurity after twenty-four months.
<b>That</b> explanation <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Menstrual <b>blood spoils and becomes milk;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei says: Her limbs become dislocated and her spirit does not return to her until twenty-four months</b> have passed. The Gemara analyzes their respective reasons. <b>Rabbi Ilai says: What is the reason of Rabbi Meir?</b> It is based upon a verse, <b>as it is written: “Who can bring a pure thing out of an impure?</b> Is it <b>not the One?”</b> (Job 14:4). In other words, is it not true that the One, i.e., God, can bring a pure thing, such as milk, out of an impure thing, such as menstrual blood?
The Gemara asks: <b>And the</b> other <b>Sages,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yosei, Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Shimon, how do they interpret this verse? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that according to those Sages <b>this</b> verse is referring to <b>semen, which is impure, and</b> yet <b>the person that is formed from it is pure.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> Those Sages maintain that this verse is referring to <b>the water of sprinkling,</b> i.e., the purification water mixed with the ashes of the red heifer. <b>As</b> the individual who <b>sprinkles</b> the water and the one <b>upon whom</b> the water is <b>sprinkled</b> are both <b>pure, and</b> yet one who <b>touches</b> the purification water is rendered <b>impure.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is</b> the <b>one who sprinkles</b> the water actually <b>pure? But isn’t it written: “He who sprinkles the water of sprinkling will wash his clothes,</b> and he who touches the water of sprinkling will be impure until evening” (Numbers 19:21)? The Gemara responds: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term: <b>“He who sprinkles”?</b> It means: <b>He who touches.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But it is written: “He who sprinkles,” and it is written</b> in the same verse: “And <b>he who touches.”</b> How can these two terms be referring to the same individual? <b>And furthermore,</b> that verse states that <b>one who sprinkles requires</b> the <b>washing</b> of his <b>clothes,</b> indicating a severe level of impurity, whereas <b>one who touches does not require</b> the <b>washing</b> of his <b>clothes.</b> Evidently, the phrase “he who sprinkles” is not referring to one who touches. <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara explains: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>“He who sprinkles”?</b> This is referring to <b>one who carries</b> the purification waters.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let</b> the Torah <b>write</b> explicitly: <b>One who carries.</b> Why does it state “he who sprinkles” when it is referring to carrying? The Gemara answers: The use of the term sprinkling in reference to carrying <b>teaches us</b> that one becomes impure <b>only by carrying</b> the <b>measure</b> required for <b>sprinkling.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who said</b> that <b>sprinkling requires</b> a minimum <b>measure</b> of water. <b>But according to the one who said</b> that <b>sprinkling does not require</b> a minimum <b>measure</b> of water, <b>what can be said?</b> According to this opinion, there is apparently no concept of a measure required for sprinkling.
The Gemara answers: <b>Even according to the one who said</b> that <b>sprinkling does not require</b> a minimum <b>measure</b> of water, <b>that statement</b> applies only to the measure of purification water that must be sprinkled <b>onto the back,</b> i.e., onto the body, <b>of</b> the impure <b>man.</b> In this regard, any amount will suffice. <b>But with regard to the vessel</b> into which one dips the hyssop in order to sprinkle the water, it <b>requires</b> a certain <b>measure</b> of water. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 12:5): <b>How much</b> water must <b>be in</b> the vessel so that it <b>will be enough for sprinkling?</b> It must be <b>enough to dip the tops of the stems</b> of the hyssop branch, used in the rite of purification, into the water <b>and sprinkle</b> it.
The Gemara concludes the discussion of the purification waters with the following observation: <b>And that is</b> the meaning of that <b>which</b> King <b>Solomon said: “I said I would become wise, but it eludes me”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:23). According to tradition, even Solomon in his great wisdom could not understand the contradictory nature of the sprinkling of purification water, as it renders an impure person pure, and a pure person impure.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Who is</b> the woman characterized as <b>an elderly woman</b> in this context? It is <b>any</b> woman for <b>whom three</b> typical menstrual <b>cycles</b> of thirty days <b>passed</b> at a stage of her life <b>close to her old age,</b> during which she saw no menstrual blood. The Gemara asks: <b>What is considered close to old age? Rav Yehuda says: Any</b> woman <b>about whom her friends say</b> that <b>she is an elderly woman. And Rabbi Shimon says:</b>

Daf 9b

It is <b>any</b> woman who is old enough <b>that</b> people <b>call her: Mother [<i>Imma</i>], Mother, and she is not embarrassed. Rabbi Zeira and Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak</b> disagree with regard to this matter. <b>One says</b> that the definition is <b>any</b> woman <b>who does not take offense</b> about being called: Mother, Mother. <b>And</b> the other <b>one says</b> that it is <b>any</b> woman <b>who is not embarrassed</b> by this. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the difference between</b> their definitions? The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between</b> them is in a case where a woman is <b>embarrassed but she does not take offense</b> when called: Mother.
The Gemara asks: <b>And how long</b> is a typical menstrual <b>cycle? Reish Lakish says in the name of Rabbi Yehuda Nesia:</b> The <b>average</b> menstrual <b>cycle</b> is <b>thirty days</b> long. <b>And Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> says: It is <b>twenty days.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> they <b>do not disagree.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rav Yehuda Nesia, <b>counts</b> all the days of her cycle, including the <b>days of impurity and days of purity. And</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> Rav Ḥisda, <b>does not count</b> the <b>days of impurity,</b> i.e., the seven days of impurity of a menstruating woman and the three days of the sighting of <i>ziva</i>.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>an elderly woman</b> for <b>whom three</b> typical menstrual <b>cycles</b> of thirty days <b>passed and</b> then <b>she saw</b> a discharge of menstrual blood, <b>her time is sufficient. And</b> if <b>a further three</b> typical menstrual <b>cycles</b> of thirty days <b>passed for her and she</b> subsequently <b>saw</b> a discharge of menstrual blood, <b>her time is sufficient. And</b> if yet <b>a further three</b> typical menstrual <b>cycles</b> of thirty days <b>passed for her and</b> then <b>she saw</b> a discharge of menstrual blood, after this third time <b>she is</b> now <b>like all</b> normal <b>women,</b> and she <b>transmits impurity</b> retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period or from examination to examination.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And it is not necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where she</b> experienced the three sightings in <b>even</b> intervals of ninety days, as in such a case it is obvious that she assumes the status of a normal woman who transmits impurity retroactively. <b>Rather, even if she</b> had intervals where she <b>decreased,</b> i.e., experienced bleeding at intervals smaller than that, <b>or even if she increased</b> and experienced bleeding at greater intervals, she still assumes the status of a woman who transmits impurity retroactively.
The Gemara infers: The wording of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Even if she</b> had intervals where she <b>decreased,</b> indicates that <b>it is not necessary</b> to teach the <i>halakha</i> in the case of a woman who experienced bleeding at <b>even</b> intervals. This is puzzling, as <b>on the contrary, if she</b> experienced bleeding at <b>even</b> intervals she thereby <b>fixes her</b> menstrual <b>cycle</b> as being every thirty days, <b>and</b> according to Rabbi Dosa (4b) the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>her time is sufficient.</b>
<b>And if you would say</b> that this <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who disagree with Rabbi Dosa, as they say</b> that <b>a woman who has</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle transmits impurity</b> retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period,</b> then the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have</b> been written in the <b>opposite</b> fashion: <b>Let</b> it <b>say: And</b> the <i>halakha</i> that an elderly woman who sees menstrual blood at intervals returns to the status of normal women and transmits impurity retroactively applies <b>not</b> only to a case where she had intervals where <b>she decreased or increased,</b> i.e., she experienced bleeding less or more than ninety days apart, <b>but</b> this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>even</b> if she experienced bleeding at <b>even</b> intervals.
The Gemara answers: <b>Teach</b> in the <i>baraita</i> in accordance with this altered version: <b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> applies <b>not</b> only to a case where she had intervals where <b>she decreased or increased, but</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if she experienced bleeding at <b>even</b> intervals. <b>And if you wish say</b> instead that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> The <i>halakha</i> that an elderly woman is retroactively impure does <b>not</b> apply to a case when she saw menstrual blood at <b>even</b> intervals. <b>Rather,</b> it applies only if <b>she decreased or increased,</b> i.e., she experienced bleeding at intervals less or more than ninety days apart. <b>But</b> if she saw blood at <b>even</b> intervals, she thereby <b>fixes</b> a set menstrual <b>cycle</b> of ninety days and her time is sufficient. The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> if so, in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to <b>any woman</b> for <b>whom</b> three typical menstrual cycles <b>passed</b> during which she saw no menstrual blood, if she experiences bleeding, her time is sufficient. Rabbi Yosei says: In the case of a pregnant woman and a nursing woman for whom three menstrual cycles passed during which they saw no menstrual blood, if she then saw blood her time is sufficient. Rabbi Eliezer cites a proof for his opinion. It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving a certain girl in</b> the village of <b>Hitlo who stopped</b> menstruating <b>for three</b> typical menstrual <b>cycles,</b> after which she experienced menstruation. <b>And the matter came before the Sages, and they said</b> that <b>her time is sufficient</b> and she does not transmit impurity retroactively.
The other Sages <b>said to</b> Rabbi Eliezer: Decisions rendered <b>in exigent circumstances are no proof.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> were the <b>exigent circumstances? Some say</b> that <b>it was</b> during the <b>years of famine,</b> and <b>some say</b> that the girl had <b>handled many ritually pure</b> items <b>and the Sages were concerned for the loss</b> of those <b>pure</b> items if they were ruled retroactively impure.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident</b> in which <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>acted</b> by ruling that the <i>halakha</i> <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer. After he remembered</b> that Rabbi Eliezer’s colleagues disagree with him on this matter and that he had apparently ruled incorrectly, <b>he</b> nevertheless <b>said: Rabbi Eliezer is worthy to rely upon in exigent circumstances.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>After he remembered? If we say</b> that this means <b>after he remembered</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, but in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> if so, <b>how could he act in accordance with</b> Rabbi Eliezer even <b>in exigent circumstances,</b> since the <i>halakha</i> has been decided against him?
<b>Rather,</b> one must say <b>that</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> had <b>not been stated</b> on this matter, <b>neither in accordance with</b> the opinion of this <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>nor in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that Sage,</b> the Rabbis. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of: <b>After he remembered? After</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>remembered that it was not a lone</b> authority who <b>disagrees with</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>but</b> it was several Sages who <b>disagreed with him,</b> and there is a principle that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of the many over the opinion of an individual, he nevertheless <b>said: Rabbi Eliezer is worthy to rely upon in exigent circumstances.</b>
The Gemara continues the discussion of a woman who fails to experience menstruation for three typical menstrual cycles. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a young girl,</b> less than twelve years old, <b>whose time to see</b> the flow of menstrual blood <b>has not arrived and she saw</b> menstrual blood, after the <b>first time her time is sufficient.</b> After the <b>second time,</b> again <b>her time is sufficient.</b> After the <b>third time, she is like all</b> normal adult <b>women, and</b> therefore <b>she transmits impurity</b> retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four<b>-</b>hour <b>period or from examination to examination.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If she then <b>passed three</b> expected menstrual <b>cycles</b> without experiencing bleeding, <b>and</b> then <b>she saw</b> menstrual blood, she returns to the status of a young girl and <b>her time is sufficient. And</b> if it <b>further</b> happens that she again <b>passed three</b> expected menstrual <b>cycles</b> without experiencing bleeding, <b>and</b> then <b>she saw</b> menstrual <b>blood, her time is sufficient. And</b> if she <b>passed three further cycles</b> without experiencing bleeding, and <b>she</b> subsequently <b>saw</b> menstrual <b>blood, she is like all</b> normal adult <b>women.</b> She is considered a woman who experiences regular menstruation at long intervals with breaks of ninety days. <b>And</b> therefore <b>she transmits impurity</b> retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period or from examination to examination.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>And</b> with regard to a girl <b>whose time to see</b> the flow of menstrual blood <b>has arrived,</b> i.e., she has reached the age of twelve, when she sees menstrual blood for the <b>first time, her time is sufficient.</b> After the <b>second</b> time, <b>she transmits impurity</b> retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period or from examination to examination.</b> If <b>three</b> menstrual <b>cycles</b> then <b>passed</b> without her experiencing bleeding, <b>and</b> afterward <b>she saw</b> menstrual <b>blood, her time is sufficient.</b> This is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, who holds that any woman who passed three expected menstrual cycles without experiencing bleeding is presumed not to be menstruating.
<b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: If the young girl who had started menstruating <b>passed three</b> expected menstrual <b>cycles</b> without experiencing bleeding and then saw menstrual blood, she returns to the status of a young girl and <b>her time is sufficient.</b>

Daf 10a

The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> if she <b>then sees</b> menstrual blood <b>at</b> regular intervals of thirty-day <b>cycles?</b> Is her time sufficient, or does she transmit impurity retroactively? <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to the <b>first time and</b> the <b>second</b> time that she sees menstrual blood, <b>her time is sufficient.</b> After the <b>third</b> time, <b>she transmits impurity</b> retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period or from examination to examination.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> further teaches, with regard to a young girl who did not experience bleeding for three typical cycles and then saw blood, <b>and three further</b> expected menstrual <b>cycles passed</b> without her experiencing bleeding <b>and</b> then afterward <b>she saw</b> menstrual <b>blood,</b> that <b>her time is sufficient.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> if she <b>then sees</b> menstrual blood <b>at</b> regular intervals of thirty-day <b>cycles?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Kahana says</b> that <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The <b>first time</b> that she sees menstrual blood, <b>her time is sufficient.</b> After the <b>second</b> time, <b>she transmits impurity</b> retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period or from examination to examination.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i>? The Gemara answers: Since the <i>baraita</i> teaches that she attains the status of a regular adult woman upon the third sighting of menstrual blood, apparently it is <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who said</b> that <b>presumption is</b> established <b>by two occasions.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Say the latter clause:</b> If she then <b>passed three</b> expected menstrual <b>cycles</b> without experiencing bleeding, <b>and</b> then <b>she saw</b> menstrual blood, she returns to the status of a young girl and <b>her time is sufficient.</b> In this ruling <b>we come to the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who holds that any woman who passed three expected menstrual cycles without experiencing bleeding is presumed not to be menstruating and her time is sufficient. Is the <i>baraita</i> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi or Rabbi Eliezer?
<b>And if you would say</b> that the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and in</b> the case of a woman who passes three menstrual <b>cycles</b> without experiencing bleeding, he <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, but does he</b> really <b>hold</b> in accordance with <b>this</b> opinion? Doesn’t the <i>baraita</i> <b>state</b> that <b>after</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>remembered</b> that several authorities disagreed with the ruling of Rabbi Eliezer, he said: Rabbi Eliezer is worthy to rely upon in exigent circumstances, i.e., only in exigent circumstances. The Gemara concludes: <b>Rather,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is Rabbi Eliezer, and with regard to</b> menstrual <b>cycles</b> he <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi,</b> that a presumptive cycle is established after two occasions of seeing menstrual blood.
§ With regard to a young girl who was just starting to menstruate, the Gemara states: If she finds a blood <b>stain between</b> the <b>first</b> and <b>second</b> time that she sees menstrual blood, she is <b>pure.</b> If it is <b>between</b> the <b>second and</b> the <b>third</b> time, <b>Ḥizkiyya says:</b> She is <b>impure; Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> She is <b>pure.</b> The Gemara explains the reasoning behind their respective opinions. <b>Ḥizkiyya says:</b> She is <b>impure, since if she had seen</b> menstrual blood it would <b>render her impure.</b> Consequently, her blood <b>stain is also impure. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> She is <b>pure, since she has not</b> yet attained the <b>presumptive status of</b> one who sees menstrual <b>blood.</b> Therefore, <b>we also do not render her impure</b> on account of <b>her</b> blood <b>stain.</b>

Daf 10b

<b>Rabbi Ilai objects to this</b> ruling of Ḥizkiyya: <b>And what</b> is the difference <b>between this</b> case of a girl who has not yet started menstruating <b>and</b> a recently married menstrual <b>virgin whose</b> stain is deemed pure for as long <b>as her blood is pure,</b> since the stain is presumed to be from her torn hymen? <b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> to him: With regard to <b>this</b> menstrual virgin, <b>her secretion [<i>sirfah</i>] is common,</b> i.e., blood from her torn hymen is normally found during this period. Therefore, any blood stain that is found is also assumed to be from her hymen. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>this</b> young girl, <b>her secretion is not common.</b> Therefore, if a blood stain is found, it is assumed to be menstrual blood.
§ <b>Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak:</b> With regard to <b>a young girl whose time to see</b> the flow of menstrual blood <b>has not arrived and she saw</b> menstrual blood <b>one time and</b> then <b>a second</b> time, but not the third time that would render her a woman who regularly sees menstrual blood, <b>her saliva and her</b> garment that she <b>treads</b> upon that are found <b>in the marketplace</b> are <b>pure</b> if we do not know whether she has menstruated. Likewise, <b>her</b> blood <b>stain</b> is <b>also pure.</b> Ulla added: <b>And I do not know if</b> this ruling with regard to the stain is merely Rabbi Yoḥanan’s own conclusion <b>or</b> if that is also part of the opinion <b>of his teacher.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What difference is</b> there? That is, what does it matter who said it? The Gemara explains: It makes a difference <b>for it to be</b> considered the <b>statement of one</b> Sage <b>in the place of two</b> dissenting opinions. As stated above, Ḥizkiyya disagrees with this ruling and maintains that a young girl’s blood stain is impure after she sees menstrual blood twice. If this statement is both Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak’s opinion and that of Rabbi Yoḥanan, then Ḥizkiyya’s ruling is opposed by two Sages, which means that his is a minority opinion. If it is Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion alone, then the two sides are equal, with one Sage maintaining each opinion.
<b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia along with <b>all the seafarers [<i>naḥotei yamma</i>], they stated</b> this ruling <b>as</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak.</b> If so, Rabbi Yoḥanan was relating his own opinion, which echoed that of his teacher, Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak, and therefore the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with this majority opinion.
§ <b>Rav Ḥilkiya bar Tovi says:</b> With regard to <b>a young girl whose time to see</b> menstrual blood <b>has not arrived, even</b> if she <b>continuously discharges</b> menstrual blood <b>for all seven</b> days of a typical menstrual period, it is considered as <b>only one sighting</b> of blood and she remains in the category of one who lacks blood until she sees menstrual blood twice more. The Gemara asks: Why did Rav Ḥilkiya bar Tovi stress: <b>Even</b> if she <b>continuously discharges</b> menstrual blood, which indicates that <b>it is not necessary</b> to teach that this is the <i>halakha</i> if she <b>stops</b> seeing a discharge and then starts again? <b>On the contrary,</b> if she <b>stops</b> and restarts <b>it is as</b> though she has had <b>two sightings</b> of menstrual blood.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> this is what Rav Ḥilkiya bar Tovi meant: With regard to <b>a young girl whose time to see</b> menstrual blood <b>has not arrived, and</b> she then <b>continuously discharges</b> menstrual blood <b>for all seven</b> days of a typical menstrual period, it is considered as <b>only one sighting</b> of blood. In other words, he did not state the word: Even.
<b>Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya says:</b> The case of woman who constantly <b>drips</b> menstrual blood is <b>not</b> considered <b>like</b> a full <b>sighting</b> of blood. The Gemara expresses surprise at this claim: <b>But</b> she <b>saw</b> blood. The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that what Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya meant was that she is <b>not</b> considered <b>like</b> one who <b>continuously discharges</b> blood, but <b>rather like</b> one who <b>stops</b> and starts again, even if she drips constantly.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>From the fact</b> that Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya claims that a different <i>halakha</i> applies to a woman who constantly drips menstrual blood, it can be inferred <b>that</b> the blood of one who <b>continuously discharges</b> menstrual blood streams <b>like a river</b> for seven days. But this is physically impossible. The Gemara explains: <b>Rather, say</b> that Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya meant that the status of a woman who constantly drips menstrual blood is <b>nothing other than</b> the status <b>of</b> a woman who <b>continuously discharges</b> blood. In both cases, it is all considered as one sighting.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>presumption</b> with regard to the <b>daughters of Israel</b> is that <b>until they have reached their</b> physical <b>maturity they have</b> the <b>presumptive status of ritual purity, and</b> adult <b>women do not</b> need to <b>examine them</b> to check if they are ritually pure before they handle consecrated items or <i>teruma</i>. <b>Once they have reached their</b> physical <b>maturity, they have</b> the <b>presumptive status of ritual impurity,</b> due to the possibility of an unnoticed menstrual discharge, <b>and</b> if they are still minors, adult <b>women</b> must <b>examine them</b> to check if they are ritually pure.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: They should not examine them by hand, because that</b> is likely to scratch them and <b>ruin their</b> status, as it will be assumed that they are ritually impure with menstrual blood. <b>Rather,</b> they <b>should smear them with oil inside and wipe them</b> off <b>on the outside. And</b> through this method <b>they are automatically examined,</b> i.e., if at that age they are ready to menstruate, the oil will cause the blood to flow.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> With regard to <b>a pregnant woman</b> and a nursing woman for whom three expected menstrual cycles passed during which they saw no menstrual blood, if she then saw blood, her time is sufficient. <b>A <i>tanna</i> taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Elazar: Rabbi Yosei says:</b> With regard to <b>a pregnant woman and a nursing woman for whom three</b> expected menstrual <b>cycles passed</b> during which they saw no menstrual blood, if she then experienced bleeding <b>her time is sufficient.</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>said to him:</b> The structure of your <i>baraita</i> is inconsistent. <b>You opened with two</b> categories of women: A pregnant woman and a nursing woman, <b>and you ended</b> your quote <b>with one,</b> as you concluded in the singular form: Her time is sufficient.
Rabbi Elazar continued: <b>Perhaps you are saying</b> that this is a case of <b>a pregnant woman who was also nursing. And</b> if so, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us a matter in passing, that</b> with regard to tallying three menstrual cycles in which she saw no menstrual blood, <b>her days of pregnancy count</b> toward, i.e., combine with, <b>her days of nursing and her days of nursing count</b> toward <b>her days of pregnancy. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Her days of pregnancy count</b> toward <b>her days of nursing and her days of nursing count</b> toward <b>her days of pregnancy.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>How so?</b> If a woman <b>stopped</b> seeing menstrual blood for <b>two</b> expected menstrual cycles <b>during her days of pregnancy and</b> then for <b>one</b> more cycle <b>during her days of nursing,</b> or she passed <b>two</b> expected menstrual cycles <b>during her days of nursing and one</b> more <b>during her days of pregnancy,</b> or <b>one and a half</b> cycles <b>during her days of pregnancy and one and a half</b> cycles <b>during her days of nursing,</b> in all these cases the missed cycles spanning her pregnancy and nursing <b>combine to</b> a total of <b>three</b> missed <b>cycles,</b> and therefore her time is sufficient.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> with regard to the claim that <b>her days of pregnancy count</b> toward <b>her days of nursing, you</b> can <b>find it</b> in a case where <b>she was nursing continuously and</b> then she <b>became pregnant. But</b> the scenario mentioned in the <i>baraita</i> where <b>her days of nursing count</b> toward <b>her days of pregnancy, how can you find these</b> circumstances? Since she certainly experienced bleeding when she gave birth, how can there be three consecutive menstrual cycles where she did not experience any discharge of blood?
The Gemara provides several answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that it is referring to a case <b>of a dry birth,</b> i.e., one without any discharge of blood. Or, <b>if you wish, say:</b> The <b>blood</b> of <b>a menstruating woman</b> is <b>discrete and</b> the <b>blood</b> seen during <b>birth</b> is <b>discrete.</b> Blood seen during birth does not disrupt the count of menstrual cycles during which a woman does not see menstrual blood. Therefore, the cycles before and after the birth combine to form the requisite three cycles according to Rabbi Eliezer. <b>Or, if you wish, say: Teach</b> only <b>one</b> of these scenarios. In other words, teach only the case where the days of pregnancy count toward the days of nursing, but not the case where the days of nursing count toward the days of pregnancy.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And with regard to what</b> did <b>they say</b> that <b>her time is sufficient?</b> It is with regard to the first sighting of blood. But with regard to the second sighting, her status is like that of any other woman and she transmits impurity for a twenty-four-hour period or from her last examination. The Gemara inquires concerning which case this clause is referring to. <b>Rav says:</b> This qualification is stated <b>with regard to all of them,</b> i.e., all four cases of the mishna: The menstrual virgin, the elderly woman, the pregnant woman, and the nursing woman.
<b>And Shmuel says: They taught</b> it <b>only</b> with regard to a menstrual <b>virgin and an elderly woman. But</b> in the case of <b>a pregnant woman and a nursing woman, their</b> time is <b>sufficient</b> for <b>all their days of pregnancy and their</b> time is <b>sufficient</b> for <b>all their days of nursing.</b>
The Gemara notes that another pair of Sages had the same dispute. <b>And similarly, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says:</b> This qualification applies <b>to all of them; and Rabbi Yoḥanan says: They taught</b> it <b>only</b> with regard to a menstrual <b>virgin and an elderly woman. But</b> in the case of a <b>pregnant woman and a nursing woman, their</b> time is <b>sufficient</b> for <b>all their days of pregnancy and their</b> time is <b>sufficient</b> for <b>all their days of nursing.</b> The Gemara suggests: This is <b>like</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a pregnant woman and a nursing woman who were</b>

Daf 11a

<b>continuously discharging</b> menstrual <b>blood, their</b> time is <b>sufficient</b> for <b>all their days of pregnancy and their</b> time is <b>sufficient</b> for <b>all their days of nursing.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon</b> all <b>say: They said</b> that <b>her time is sufficient only with regard to</b> the <b>first sighting</b> of blood, <b>but with regard to the second</b> sighting, her status is like that of any other woman, and she <b>transmits impurity for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period or from examination to examination.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And if she saw</b> the <b>first</b> sighting as a result of unnatural circumstances, then even with regard to the second sighting her time is sufficient. <b>Rav Huna says:</b> If she <b>jumped and saw</b> menstrual blood, and again she <b>jumped and saw</b> menstrual blood, and a third time she <b>jumped and saw</b> menstrual blood, she has <b>established a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> occurrence has she established a fixed cycle? <b>If we say</b> that it is a cycle <b>of days</b> alone, <b>this</b> cannot be correct, <b>as every day that she did not jump,</b> she also <b>did not see</b> menstrual blood. Therefore, her cycle cannot be a mere pattern of days.
The Gemara explains: <b>Rather,</b> the established menstrual cycle is caused <b>by jumps,</b> i.e., by observing a pattern of jumping and seeing blood three times, she has established that jumping causes the onset of her menstrual period. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Any</b> woman who <b>establishes</b> a pattern of seeing menstrual blood <b>due to</b> a recurring <b>accident,</b> even if the pattern repeats, still has <b>not established a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle?</b> An accidental menstrual pattern brought about by external causes does not create a menstrual cycle. The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that the <i>baraita</i> means that she has <b>not established a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle at all?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means that she has <b>not established a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle of days alone, nor of jumps alone, but</b> she has <b>established a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle for</b> a combination of <b>days and of jumps.</b> In other words, she has established a fixed menstrual cycle when she jumps on specific days. The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that she does not establish a cycle <b>for days alone?</b> Why is it necessary to state this? <b>Rav Ashi says:</b> It is necessary to teach this in a case <b>where</b> she <b>jumped on Sunday and saw</b> menstrual blood, <b>and</b> again she <b>jumped on Sunday and saw</b> menstrual blood, <b>and</b> then <b>on</b> the following <b>Shabbat she jumped and did not see</b> blood, <b>but on Sunday,</b> the next day, <b>she saw</b> menstrual blood <b>without jumping.</b>
Rav Ashi explains: <b>Lest you say</b> that the <b>matter</b> is <b>revealed retroactively that it</b> was <b>the day that caused</b> her to experience menstruation <b>and</b> not the <b>jumping,</b> and therefore she has established a menstrual cycle of menstruating on Sundays, regardless of jumping, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us that</b> it was <b>also</b> the jumping <b>of yesterday,</b> on Shabbat, that <b>caused</b> the menstruation today, on Sunday. <b>And</b> as for the fact <b>that she did not see</b> menstrual blood then, that was <b>because the time</b> when <b>jumping</b> causes menstruation had <b>not</b> yet <b>arrived.</b>
The Gemara presents <b>another version</b> of Rav Huna’s statement. <b>Rav Huna says:</b> If a woman <b>jumped and saw</b> menstrual blood, and again she <b>jumped and saw</b> menstrual blood, and a third time she <b>jumped and saw</b> menstrual blood, she has <b>established a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle for</b> a pattern of <b>days and not for</b> a pattern of <b>jumps.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? Rav Ashi says:</b> This is referring to a case <b>where</b> she <b>jumped on Sunday and saw</b> menstrual blood, <b>and</b> then again she <b>jumped on Sunday and saw</b> menstrual blood, <b>and</b> then <b>on</b> the following <b>Shabbat she jumped and did not see</b> blood, <b>but on Sunday,</b> the next day, <b>she saw</b> menstrual blood <b>without jumping.</b> In that case <b>there,</b> the <b>matter</b> is <b>revealed retroactively</b> that it is <b>the day that causes</b> her to menstruate, not the jumping.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Although</b> the Rabbis <b>said</b> that for a woman with a fixed menstrual cycle <b>her time is sufficient</b> and she does not transmit impurity retroactively, <b>she is required to examine herself</b> each day to ensure that she is ritually pure and will not impurify pure items that she is handling. All women must examine themselves each day <b>except for a menstruating woman,</b> whose impure status is known, <b>and</b> a woman after childbirth <b>who is observing</b> the period of the <b>blood of purity,</b> whose ritually pure status is known even if she experiences bleeding.
<b>And</b> even a woman with a fixed menstrual cycle <b>engages in intercourse while</b> using <b>examination cloths</b> to ascertain whether her menstrual flow began, <b>except for</b> a woman after childbirth <b>who is observing</b> the period of the <b>blood of purity, and a virgin whose blood is ritually pure</b> for four days after engaging in intercourse for the first time.
<b>And she is required to examine</b> herself <b>twice</b> each day: In the <b>morning,</b> to ascertain if she menstruated during the night, <b>and</b> at <b>twilight,</b> to ascertain if she menstruated during the day. <b>And</b> she is also required to examine herself <b>at a time that she is about to engage in intercourse with her husband.</b> The obligation of <b>women of priestly</b> families is <b>greater than</b> that of other women, as they are also required to examine themselves <b>when they</b> seek to <b>partake of <i>teruma</i>. Rabbi Yehuda says: Even when they conclude partaking of <i>teruma</i></b> they are required to examine themselves, in order to ascertain whether they experienced bleeding while partaking of <i>teruma</i>.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: All women must examine themselves each day, <b>except for a menstruating woman.</b> The Gemara explains: Such a woman does not need to examine herself, <b>as during the days of her menstruation</b> she <b>does not need examination.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, who said</b> that <b>a woman</b> can <b>establish a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle</b> even <b>during the days</b> that she <b>has <i>zava</i> status, but a woman does not establish a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle during the days of her</b> impurity due to <b>menstruation,</b> as any bleeding during these seven days is merely a continuation of her original menstruation. According to this opinion, it is <b>well,</b> and one can understand the mishna. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said</b> that <b>a woman</b> can <b>establish a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle during the days of her menstruation, let her examine</b> herself, as <b>perhaps</b> she will <b>establish a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle.</b>
The Gemara explains that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> could <b>say to you: When I say</b> that a woman can establish a fixed menstrual cycle during the days of her menstruation, that applies only in a case <b>where</b> the first two instances of her fixed cycle were established when she first <b>saw</b> blood <b>from a stopped source,</b> i.e., she saw blood on those particulars days at the outset of her period. <b>But</b> when she first <b>saw</b> blood <b>from an open source,</b> i.e., when the first two instances that she experienced bleeding on those particular days was in the middle of her menstrual period, <b>I did not say</b> that she establishes a fixed menstrual cycle, and therefore there is no need for her to examine herself.
§ The mishna teaches: All women must examine themselves each day, except for a menstruating woman, whose impure status is known, <b>and</b> a woman after childbirth <b>who is observing</b> the period of the <b>blood of purity.</b> The Gemara explains: It may <b>enter your mind</b> that when the mishna mentions a woman who is observing the period of the blood of purity, it is referring to one who is finishing the period of impurity following a birth and is <b>anticipating observing</b> the period <b>of</b> the <b>blood of purity.</b> In other words, her days of impurity are ending and she is about to start her days `of purity, and the mishna is stating that there is no need for an examination to conclude her days of impurity before starting her days of purity.
The Gemara analyzes the mishna in accordance with this interpretation. <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, who said</b> that blood after birth and blood of purity both come from <b>one source,</b> and <b>the Torah deemed</b> blood after birth <b>impure, and the Torah deemed</b> blood of purity <b>pure.</b> According to this opinion, it is <b>well,</b> and one can understand the mishna, since even if she emits blood continuously through the end of her days of impurity into her days of purity, the blood during her days of purity is pure.
But <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Levi, who said</b> that <b>there are two</b> distinct <b>sources,</b> one for blood after birth and one for blood of purity, <b>she should</b> be required to <b>examine</b> herself at the end of the period following birth, as <b>perhaps that impure source</b> of blood after birth had <b>not yet stopped</b> flowing. The Gemara explains that <b>Levi</b> could <b>say to you:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> ruling?

Daf 11b

<b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, who say</b> that there <b>is</b> only <b>one source</b> for the two types of blood (see 35b). The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> can it be that <b>the <i>tanna</i> taught us an unattributed</b> mishna, which is generally accepted as the <i>halakha</i>, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai,</b> whose opinion is usually not accepted as <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> a case where the mishna first records <b>an unattributed opinion and afterward</b> it records <b>a dispute</b> with regard to the same matter. <b>And</b> there is a principle that <b>any</b> time the mishna first records <b>an unattributed opinion and afterward</b> it records that the ruling is subject to <b>a dispute,</b> then the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not</b> necessarily <b>in accordance with the unattributed opinion.</b>
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Does</b> the mishna <b>teach:</b> A woman is <b>anticipating observing</b> the period <b>of</b> the blood of purity? Rather, it teaches: <b>Who is observing</b> the period of the blood of purity. The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the mishna is referring to a woman <b>who is</b> already <b>observing</b> the period of the blood of purity, <b>what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> that she is exempt from performing examinations? Isn’t this obvious? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>she should examine</b> herself, <b>as perhaps</b> she will find that <b>she established a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle</b> through blood found on her examination cloths, the mishna <b>teaches us that</b> a woman <b>does not establish</b> a cycle from sightings of blood that came from <b>a pure source</b> that transfers <b>to</b> the period when she sees blood from <b>an impure source.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this answer: <b>This</b> answer <b>works out well according to Levi, who said</b> that <b>there are two</b> distinct <b>sources,</b> one for blood after birth and one for blood of purity; one can understand that she does not establish a cycle with regard to blood from one source, from a sighting of blood from a different source. <b>But according to Rav, who said</b> that blood after birth and blood of purity both come from <b>one source, she should</b> be required to <b>examine</b> herself during the period of the blood of purity, as <b>perhaps she established a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Even so,</b> i.e., that both types of blood come from the same source, nevertheless a woman <b>does not establish</b> a cycle <b>from</b> her <b>days of purity</b> that transfers <b>to</b> her <b>days of impurity.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> even a woman with a fixed menstrual cycle <b>engages in intercourse while</b> using <b>examination cloths</b> to ascertain whether her menstrual flow began, except for a woman after childbirth who is observing the period of the blood of purity, and a virgin whose blood is ritually pure for four days after engaging in intercourse for the first time. In this connection, the Gemara notes that <b>we learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (64b): With regard to <b>a young girl whose time to see</b> the flow of menstrual blood <b>has not arrived,</b> as she has not yet reached puberty, <b>and she married, Beit Shammai say:</b> The Sages <b>give her four nights</b> after intercourse during which the blood is attributed to her torn hymen and she is ritually pure. Thereafter, any blood is menstrual blood and she is impure. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> The blood is attributed to the torn hymen <b>until the wound heals.</b>
With regard to Beit Hillel’s statement, <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> They <b>taught</b> this <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> she <b>does not stop</b> seeing blood <b>due to intercourse.</b> In other words, every time she engages in intercourse she experiences bleeding. In that case, even if <b>she saw</b> blood <b>not due to intercourse,</b> Beit Hillel still attribute the blood to the torn hymen. <b>But</b> if she <b>stops seeing</b> blood <b>due to intercourse, and</b> then she subsequently <b>saw</b> blood on another occasion, that blood renders her <b>impure.</b>
He continues: Similarly, if <b>one night passed without</b> them engaging in <b>intercourse and she</b> subsequently <b>saw</b> blood without connection to intercourse, this indicates that the blood is no longer from her torn hymen and therefore she is deemed <b>impure.</b> Likewise, if the <b>appearance</b> of <b>her blood</b> had changed since her initial blood from her torn hymen, she is <b>impure. Rabbi Yona raises an objection</b> to this last <i>halakha</i> from the mishna: <b>And a virgin whose blood is ritually pure</b> is not required to examine herself when she engages in intercourse. <b>Why</b> not? <b>She should engage in intercourse while</b> using <b>examination cloths, as perhaps</b> she will find that the <b>appearance of her blood</b> has <b>changed,</b> which would mean that her blood is no longer ritually pure blood from her torn hymen.
<b>Rava says: Say the first clause:</b> All women must engage in intercourse while using examination cloths, <b>except for a menstruating woman</b> whose impure status is certain <b>and</b> a woman after childbirth <b>who is observing</b> the period of the <b>blood of purity.</b> It can be inferred from here that these two exceptions are not required for women to examine themselves, <b>but a virgin whose blood is pure</b> is <b>required</b> to perform <b>an examination.</b> This ruling apparently supports Shmuel’s opinion that examination is required to determine if there is a change in the appearance of her blood. <b>But</b> if so, then the two clauses of the mishna are <b>difficult,</b> as they contradict <b>each other.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>Here,</b> in the latter clause that indicates that a virgin requires no examination, it is referring to a case <b>where she had engaged in intercourse.</b> In such a situation an examination would be inconclusive, <b>as</b> even if the appearance of her blood had changed, one can <b>say</b> that it was because the man’s <b>organ soiled it,</b> i.e., perhaps the intercourse caused the change of appearance in her blood. By contrast, <b>there,</b> in the first clause, it is referring to a case <b>where she</b> had <b>not engaged in intercourse,</b> and therefore she is required to perform an examination to determine if there was a change in appearance in her blood, as any difference in appearance would indicate a change from pure blood to impure blood.
The Gemara notes <b>that</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. With regard to the opinion of Beit Hillel that blood is attributed to the torn hymen until the wound heals, the <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> In a case <b>where she does not stop</b> seeing blood <b>due to intercourse,</b> i.e., every time she engages in intercourse she experiences bleeding. If so, even when <b>she sees</b> blood <b>not due to intercourse,</b> it is deemed pure.
<b>But</b> if she <b>stopped seeing</b> blood <b>due to intercourse, and</b> she subsequently <b>sees</b> blood at a different time, that sighting renders her <b>impure.</b> Similarly, if <b>one night passed without</b> her engaging in <b>intercourse and</b> then <b>she saw</b> blood without connection to intercourse, she is deemed <b>impure.</b> Furthermore, if she sees blood and the <b>appearance</b> of <b>her blood</b> had changed from her initial blood from her torn hymen, she is <b>impure.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And she is required</b> to examine herself <b>twice</b> each day, in the morning and at twilight. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The mishna <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only with regard to</b> touching ritually <b>pure</b> items. <b>But with regard to her husband, she is permitted</b> to him without any requirement to perform examinations. The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious,</b> as <b>we learn</b> in the mishna that she must examine herself twice a day, and the first time is in the <b>morning?</b> This indicates that the mishna is concerned about the status of ritually pure items that she will handle during the day, but not about intercourse with her husband, as a couple usually engages in relations at night rather than during the day.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, if</b> the statement of Rav Yehuda citing Shmuel <b>was stated,</b> it <b>was stated with regard to the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>And</b> she is also required to examine herself <b>at a time that she is about to engage in intercourse with her husband. Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The mishna <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only with regard to a woman who is engaged in</b> handling <b>pure</b> items. She alone is required to examine herself before intercourse. The reason is <b>that since</b> she is <b>required</b> to perform <b>an examination</b> in preparation <b>for</b> handling <b>pure</b> items, she <b>also requires an examination</b> in preparation <b>for</b> intercourse with <b>her husband. But</b> with regard to a woman who <b>is not engaged in</b> handling <b>pure</b> items, she is <b>not required</b> to perform <b>an examination</b> in preparation for intercourse with her husband.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rav Yehuda <b>teaching us? We</b> already <b>learn</b> this from the mishna (15a): <b>All women have the presumptive status of purity to their husbands,</b> and therefore the husband does not need to ascertain whether she is ritually pure before engaging in intercourse. The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> this <i>halakha</i> is learned <b>from the mishna</b> alone, <b>I would say</b> that <b>this statement</b> applies only <b>to a woman who has</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle. But</b> in the case of <b>a woman who does not have</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle,</b> she is <b>required</b> to perform <b>an examination</b> before intercourse. Consequently, Rav Yehuda teaches us that even a woman who does not have a fixed menstrual cycle is not required to perform an examination before intercourse, unless she handles pure items.
The Gemara asks: <b>But aren’t we are dealing</b> in <b>the mishna with</b> a case <b>of a woman who has</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle?</b> The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>is dealing both</b> with a case <b>where she has</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle</b> and with a case where <b>she does not have</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle. And this</b> is what the mishna <b>teaches us: That even though she has</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle,</b> and therefore one might think that she is exempt from examination, nevertheless if she handles pure items, <b>since</b> she is <b>required</b> to perform <b>an examination</b> in preparation <b>for</b> handling those <b>pure</b> items, she is <b>also required</b> to perform <b>an examination</b> in preparation <b>for</b> intercourse with <b>her husband.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Shmuel</b> already <b>state</b> this <i>halakha</i> on <b>another occasion? As Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rabbi Abba bar Yirmeya says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>a woman who does not have</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle,</b> it is <b>forbidden</b> for her to engage in intercourse with her husband <b>until she examines</b> herself and determines that she is pure. <b>And we interpreted</b> this <i>halakha</i> as referring to a case <b>where she is engaged in</b> handling <b>pure</b> items. The Gemara answers: Shmuel did not in fact issue two statements; rather, <b>one was stated by inference from the other.</b> In other words, Shmuel said one of these statements explicitly; the other was reported by his students in his name based on an inference from what he had said.
The Gemara adds: <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that a woman requires an examination, <b>said?</b> It is said with regard to a woman who is preparing <b>for</b> handling <b>pure</b> items. <b>But</b> with regard to engaging in intercourse <b>with her husband, she is permitted</b> to do so without performing an examination. The <i>baraita</i> qualifies this ruling: And <b>in what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that she is not required to perform an examination, <b>said?</b> It is said <b>when</b> her husband traveled and <b>left her with the presumptive status of ritual purity.</b> If so, upon his return she does not need to perform an examination before they engage in intercourse. <b>But</b> if he <b>left her with the presumptive status of ritual impurity,</b> she remains <b>forever in her status of impurity, until she says to him: I am ritually pure.</b>

Daf 12a

§ <b>Rabbi Zeira raised a dilemma before Rav Yehuda: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> as to whether <b>a woman should examine herself</b> before engaging in intercourse <b>with her husband?</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: She should not examine</b> herself. Rabbi Zeira asked: <b>And let her examine</b> herself; <b>what</b> would be the problem <b>with that?</b> Rav Yehuda answered: <b>If so,</b> the <b>heart</b> of a scrupulous husband might <b>strike him</b> with pangs of conscience over sins that he could transgress, <b>and he</b> will <b>separate</b> from his wife out of fear that she is impure.
<b>Rabbi Abba raised</b> a similar <b>dilemma before Rav Huna: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> as to whether <b>a woman should examine herself</b> immediately after engaging in intercourse, within the minimum <b>period of time</b> needed for the onset of <b>menstruation, in order to render her husband liable to</b> bring <b>a sin offering</b> for engaging in intercourse with a menstruating woman?
Rav Huna <b>said to him:</b> Can <b>you find</b> a case <b>where</b> it is physically possible to perform a full examination after intercourse within the <b>period of time</b> needed for the onset of <b>menstruation? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is</b> the <b>period of time</b> needed for the onset of <b>menstruation?</b> This is <b>comparable to</b> a male <b>organ and an examination cloth that are standing alongside the doorpost,</b> i.e., at the entrance to the vagina; <b>upon the exit of</b> the <b>organ</b> the <b>examination cloth</b> immediately <b>enters.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>It is</b> apparent that <b>the period of time that they stated</b> is the time required <b>for</b> an external <b>wipe, and not</b> for a full internal <b>examination.</b> Therefore, if she did an internal examination and found blood, one cannot be certain that she was already menstruating during intercourse and thereby render the husband liable to bring a sin offering. <b>Rather,</b> this is Rabbi Abba’s dilemma: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> as to whether a woman <b>should wipe</b> herself immediately after engaging in intercourse? Since this action can be performed quickly, if she were to find blood her husband would be liable to bring a sin offering.
<b>Some say</b> that <b>this</b> is the dilemma that Rabbi Abba <b>raised before</b> Rav Huna: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> as to whether <b>a woman should examine herself</b> immediately after engaging in intercourse, <b>in order to render her husband liable to</b> bring <b>a provisional guilt offering</b> brought by one who is uncertain as to whether he committed a sin that requires a sin offering? Rav Huna <b>said to him: She should not examine</b> herself. Rabbi Abba asked: <b>And</b> let <b>her examine</b> herself; <b>what</b> would be the problem <b>with that?</b> Rav Huna answered: <b>If so,</b> the <b>heart</b> of a scrupulous husband might <b>strike him</b> with pangs of conscience over sins that he could transgress, <b>and he</b> will <b>separate</b> from his wife out of fear that she is impure.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> she is also required to examine herself <b>at a time that she is about to</b> engage in intercourse with her husband. <b>Rabbi Ami says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yannai says: And this</b> examination performed before intercourse is known as: The <b>examination cloth of virtuous women,</b> as this examination is not strictly required. <b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel said to Rabbi Ami:</b> The <i>tanna</i> teaches that women <b>are required</b> to perform this examination, <b>and</b> yet <b>you teach</b> that only <b>virtuous women</b> perform it. Rabbi Ami <b>said to him:</b> Yes, <b>as I say</b> that <b>anyone who fulfills the statements of the Sages is called virtuous.</b> Rabbi Ami did not mean that this examination is beyond the letter of the law. He was simply praising those who abide by the established <i>halakha</i>.
With regard to Rabbi Ami’s claim, <b>Rava says: And</b> according to your opinion, with regard to one <b>who does not fulfill the statements of the Sages, he is not called virtuous. But</b> this indicates that <b>he is not called wicked</b> either. This cannot be correct, as one who does not heed the instructions of the Sages is certainly wicked. <b>Rather, Rava said: Virtuous women</b> are those who do not reuse <b>the examination cloth that they used to examine themselves before this intercourse.</b> Even if no blood was found on it, <b>they do not examine themselves with it prior to another</b> act of <b>intercourse,</b> as once it was used once, it is not as clean as before. <b>And those who are not virtuous women</b> reuse the same examination cloths and <b>examine</b> themselves with them <b>and they are not particular</b> about this matter.
§ The Gemara returns to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rabbi Abba bar Yirmeya says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>a woman who does not have</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle,</b> it is <b>forbidden</b> for her <b>to engage in intercourse until she examines</b> herself. <b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rabbi Abba bar Yirmeya:</b> Does Shmuel mean that if <b>she does not have</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle</b> she is <b>required</b> to perform <b>an examination,</b> but if <b>she has</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle</b> she is <b>not required</b> to perform <b>an examination?</b> This is difficult, as the mishna teaches that even a woman with a fixed menstrual cycle is required to perform an examination before she engages in intercourse.
Rabbi Abba bar Yirmeya <b>said to him:</b> The mishna means that if <b>she has</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle</b> and she is <b>awake,</b> she is <b>required</b> to perform <b>an examination;</b> if she is <b>sleeping</b> she is <b>not required</b> to perform <b>an examination</b> before intercourse, as this would involve much effort. If <b>she does not have</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle,</b> then <b>whether</b> she is <b>awake or sleeping,</b> she is <b>required</b> to perform <b>an examination.</b>
<b>Rava says: And let</b> Rabbi Abba bar Yirmeya <b>say</b> a different answer <b>to</b> Rabbi Zeira: Shmuel means that if <b>she has</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle,</b> then <b>in</b> the case of a woman who handles <b>pure</b> items, she is <b>required</b> to perform <b>an examination</b> for the sake of intercourse as well. If she does not handle pure items, then <b>for</b> the sake of intercourse with <b>her husband</b> alone she is <b>not required</b> to perform <b>an examination.</b> By contrast, if she <b>does not have</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle,</b> then she is <b>required</b> to perform <b>an examination even for</b> the sake of intercourse with <b>her husband.</b> Rava concludes: <b>And from</b> the fact <b>that</b> Rabbi Abba bar Yirmeya <b>did not say this</b> answer, one can <b>learn from</b> it that <b>Shmuel holds</b> that in <b>any</b> case where an examination is only <b>for</b> the purpose of intercourse with <b>her husband,</b> she is <b>not required</b> to perform <b>an examination.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>donkey drivers and laborers</b> who return home, <b>and those who come</b> home <b>from the house of mourning or from the house of feasting</b> for a wedding, <b>their wives</b> remain <b>in a presumptive status of purity. And</b> therefore <b>they may come and remain with them,</b> i.e., engage in intercourse with them, <b>whether they are sleeping or awake.</b> The <i>baraita</i> clarifies: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? When</b> the husbands <b>left</b> their wives <b>in a presumptive state of purity. But</b> if the husbands <b>left them in a presumptive state of impurity, she</b> remains <b>forever</b> in a status of <b>impurity, until she says to him: I am ritually pure.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to Rabbi Abba bar Yirmeya, <b>with regard to what</b> case does <b>Shmuel interpret this</b> <i>baraita</i>? If the <i>baraita</i> is dealing <b>with</b> a woman <b>who has</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle,</b> it is <b>difficult,</b> as Shmuel holds that such a woman who is <b>awake</b> is required to perform an examination, whereas the <i>baraita</i> indicates that no examination is necessary. <b>And if</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> a woman <b>who does not have</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle,</b> it is also <b>difficult,</b> as Shmuel holds that she always is required to perform an examination, <b>whether</b> she is <b>awake or sleeping.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where she has</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle, and since</b> her husband came home from his travels and <b>requested of her</b> that they engage in intercourse, <b>there is no greater examination than this.</b> Since she had time to consider the matter while he was asking her, she would have remembered had she sensed the onset of her menstrual cycle, whereas under regular circumstances she might not have time to recall. Based upon this explanation, <b>Rav Pappa said to Rava: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to acting in accordance with this <i>baraita</i>?</b> Perhaps it is necessary to wake her and ask her whether she is ritually pure.

Daf 12b

Rava <b>said to</b> Rav Pappa: <b>Wise one [<i>sudani</i>]! No, won’t she be demeaned before him?</b> It is embarrassing for her if she is awoken and has to think about whether or not she is pure. <b>Rav Kahana says: I asked the members of the households,</b> i.e., the wives, <b>of Rav Pappa and of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: When the Sages,</b> your husbands, <b>came</b> home <b>from</b> the <b>study hall,</b> did they <b>require you</b> to perform <b>an examination prior</b> to intercourse? <b>And they said to me: No.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why ask their wives? Why not <b>ask</b> those Sages <b>themselves?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Perhaps</b> they might rule leniently for others, while <b>acting stringently with themselves.</b> Therefore, their wives were asked, to determine how the Sages conducted themselves in their personal lives.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a woman who does not have</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle,</b> she is <b>forbidden to engage in intercourse, and she does not have</b> the right to receive payment of her <b>marriage contract</b> if divorced or widowed, <b>nor</b> is she entitled to payment from her husband for the <b>produce</b> of her property that he consumed, <b>nor</b> is she entitled to provisions for her <b>sustenance</b> from his estate, <b>nor</b> does she get back her <b>worn clothes</b> or other items she brought with her to her marriage as part of her dowry. And furthermore, her husband <b>must divorce</b> her <b>and he may never remarry</b> her. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says:</b> She is permitted to <b>engage in intercourse</b> with her husband, but she must examine herself <b>with two examination cloths,</b> one prior to intercourse and one afterward. <b>They</b> may be to <b>her detriment</b> if she finds blood on the cloths, or <b>they</b> may lead to <b>her betterment,</b> since if she finds no blood she is permitted to her husband. <b>They said in the name of Abba Ḥanan: Woe to her husband!</b>
The Gemara explains each clause of the <i>baraita</i>: She is <b>forbidden to engage in intercourse,</b> as <b>perhaps she will ruin</b> her husband if she emits blood during intercourse. <b>And</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that <b>she does not have</b> the right to receive payment of her <b>marriage contract,</b> the reason is that <b>since</b> she is <b>not fit for intercourse, she is not</b> entitled to payment of her <b>marriage contract.</b>
The Gemara continues its explanation: <b>And</b> she is <b>not</b> entitled to payment for the <b>produce</b> of her property, <b>nor</b> is she entitled to provisions for her <b>sustenance</b> from his estate, <b>nor</b> does she get back her <b>worn clothes.</b> The reason for all these is because <b>stipulations in the marriage contract are considered like the marriage contract</b> itself. Since she is not entitled to a marriage contract, she is likewise not entitled to these additional provisions that are stipulated in the marriage contract.
The Gemara analyzes the next clause in the <i>baraita</i>: Her husband <b>must divorce</b> her <b>and he may never remarry</b> her. The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this in a case <b>where</b> her situation <b>was subsequently amended,</b> i.e., she established a fixed menstrual cycle. <b>Lest you say</b> that he <b>may remarry her,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not permitted, <b>as sometimes</b> such a woman might <b>go and marry</b> someone else <b>and</b> her status is <b>subsequently amended.</b>
<b>And</b> the problem in this scenario is that her first husband might <b>say: If I would have known that it is like this,</b> that she would be cured, <b>even if you would have given me one hundred</b> times <b>one hundred dinars</b> to divorce her <b>I would not have divorced her. And</b> if so, the <b>bill of divorce</b> will be <b>found</b> to be <b>void, and her children</b> from her second husband will be considered <b><i>mamzerim</i>.</b> Therefore it must be made clear to him from the outset that this divorce is final.
The Gemara analyzes the final clause of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>They said in the name of Abba Ḥanan: Woe to her husband! Some say</b> that <b>he said this to Rabbi Meir, as</b> Abba Ḥanan maintains that the husband is <b>required to settle</b> her payment of <b>her marriage contract</b> upon their divorce. And <b>some say</b> that <b>he said this to Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus,</b> since Abba Ḥanan disagrees with his opinion and holds that it is forbidden to engage in intercourse with her, <b>as</b> perhaps <b>she will ruin him</b> if they engage in intercourse when she is menstruating.
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And with regard to what</b> case did Shmuel issue this ruling of <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara elaborates: <b>If</b> it is referring to a woman who <b>is engaged in</b> handling ritually <b>pure</b> items, <b>didn’t Shmuel</b> already <b>say</b> on <b>another occasion</b> that a woman without a fixed menstrual cycle must examine herself prior to intercourse?
<b>And if</b> it is referring to a woman <b>who is not engaged in</b> handling ritually <b>pure</b> items, <b>doesn’t</b> Shmuel <b>say</b> that in <b>any</b> case where an examination is only <b>for</b> the purpose of intercourse with <b>her husband,</b> not for handling pure items, she is <b>not required</b> to perform <b>an examination? As Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rabbi Abba bar Yirmeya says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: A woman who does not have</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle is forbidden to engage in intercourse until she examines</b> herself, <b>and we interpreted this</b> statement as referring to cases <b>where she is engaged in</b> handling ritually <b>pure</b> items. The Gemara answers: <b>He who teaches this does not teach that,</b> i.e., Shmuel’s ruling is in fact referring to a woman engaged in handling pure items, and the two rulings were cited in his name by different Sages.

Daf 13a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>any hand that is diligent to examine</b> bodily emissions to ascertain ritual impurity, <b>among women</b> such a hand <b>is praiseworthy. But among men</b> such a hand <b>should be severed,</b> as this action is apt to lead to a seminal emission for naught.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>women and what is different</b> about <b>men,</b> that women are praised for examining for bodily emissions while men are castigated for the same? The Gemara answers: <b>Women are not susceptible to</b> sexual <b>arousal</b> by this action, and therefore when a woman is diligent to examine herself she is considered <b>praiseworthy;</b> whereas <b>men, who are susceptible to</b> sexual <b>arousal</b> and may experience a seminal emission as a result of this contact, may not do so, and the hand of a man who conducts frequent examinations for emissions <b>should be severed.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why</b> does the mishna state <b>specifically</b> among men that only the hand that is <b>diligent</b> to examine, i.e., that does so often, should be severed? Even <b>when</b> a man <b>is not diligent</b> to examine, but does so occasionally, this action is <b>also</b> apt to cause a seminal emission. The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> Any hand that is <b>diligent</b> to examine, it states this only <b>with regard to women,</b> as men should not examine even occasionally.
The Gemara continues to discuss the examination of men for seminal emissions. It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that men should not examine themselves, <b>said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to</b> an examination for <b>semen. But with regard to</b> a man who examines himself for gonorrhea-like <b>discharge [<i>zov</i>], he too is praiseworthy</b> for examining diligently, <b>as women</b> are. The reason is that a man who experiences two such discharges is ritually impure but is not obligated to bring an offering, whereas one who experiences three such emissions must bring an offering as a <i>zav</i>. Therefore, it is important for a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge to examine and count his emissions carefully.
The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And even with regard to semen, if one wants to examine</b> himself <b>with a rock or with</b> a piece of <b>earthenware,</b> which are hard and will not warm the body, <b>he may examine</b> himself in this manner.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> may a man <b>not</b> examine himself <b>with</b> a linen <b>cloth? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A man <b>may examine himself with a cloth,</b> to see if he has emitted semen, <b>or with any</b> similar <b>item that he wants?</b> The Gemara answers: Just <b>as Abaye said,</b> with regard to a different issue, that it is referring <b>to a coarse cloth,</b> which will not warm one’s body, <b>here too,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a coarse cloth,</b> which will not lead to a seminal emission.
The Gemara asks: <b>And where was</b> this statement <b>of Abaye stated?</b> It was stated <b>with regard to that which we learned</b> in a mishna (40a): If a priest <b>was eating <i>teruma</i> and he sensed that his limbs quaked,</b> indicating that a seminal emission was imminent, he should firmly <b>hold his penis</b> to prevent the emission from leaving his body, <b>and swallow the <i>teruma</i></b> while ritually pure.
A difficulty was raised with regard to this mishna: May he actually <b>hold</b> his penis? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who holds his penis and urinates,</b> it is considered <b>as though he is bringing a flood to the world,</b> as masturbation was one of the sins that led to the flood (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 108b)? <b>Abaye says</b> in resolution of this difficulty that the mishna is referring to one who holds his penis <b>with a coarse cloth.</b>
<b>Rava says</b> with regard to that mishna: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that it is referring to a priest who holds his penis <b>with a soft cloth,</b> and the reason it is permitted is that <b>once</b> the semen <b>has</b> already been <b>uprooted</b> from his body, it is <b>uprooted,</b> and his subsequent holding of the penis, even with a soft cloth, does not increase the emission of semen. <b>And Abaye</b> prohibits the use of a soft cloth even here, as he is <b>concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> due to the contact of this cloth one might <b>come to increase</b> the emission of semen. <b>But Rava is not concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> one might <b>come to increase</b> the emission.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is Rava <b>not</b> concerned for this possibility? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>To what is this</b> repeated examination of a man <b>comparable? To</b> one who <b>places a finger in</b> his <b>eye, for as long as</b> the <b>finger</b> is <b>in the eye,</b> the <b>eye will tear and continue to tear.</b> Here too, the priest’s action will lead to an increased emission of semen.
The Gemara answers: <b>And Rava</b> would claim that if the priest’s limbs were not quaking and the semen was coming out in drops, there is indeed a concern that an examination might increase the emission. But when he feels his limbs quaking, this concern does not apply. The reason is that with regard to <b>any warming</b> of the body that leads to a seminal emission <b>and</b> that is <b>then</b> followed by another <b>warming at the time</b> when the semen is being uprooted, it is <b>uncommon</b> for the latter warming to increase the emission. Consequently, in this case the priest may hold his penis even with a soft cloth.
The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who holds</b> his <b>penis and urinates,</b> it is considered <b>as though he is bringing a flood to the world.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Eliezer: But</b> if one does not hold his penis, <b>small drops are sprayed on his legs, and he appears as one whose penis has been severed.</b> A man with that affliction is incapable of fathering children. People who see urine on his legs might suspect that he is suffering from that condition <b>and as a result</b> they will <b>cast aspersions about his children</b> and say <b>that they are children born from a forbidden relationship [<i>mamzerim</i>].</b>
Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to them: It is preferable that</b> people <b>cast aspersions about his children that they are <i>mamzerim</i>, and he should not render himself wicked</b> even <b>one moment before the Omnipresent.</b>
With regard to the same issue, it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer said to</b> the other <b>Rabbis</b> in response: It is <b>possible</b> for one to avoid spraying urine on his legs. How so? <b>Let a person stand on an elevated place and urinate</b> downward, <b>or urinate into</b> an area where there is <b>loose soil,</b> which absorbs the urine, so that it does not ricochet upward, <b>and he should not render himself wicked</b> even <b>one moment before the Omnipresent.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> of these replies <b>did</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>say to</b> the Rabbis <b>first? If we say</b> that it was the <b>first</b> statement, i.e., that one should not hold his penis even if people might cast aspersions about his children, that he <b>said to</b> the Rabbis <b>first,</b> and subsequently he told them that there was a way to avoid urine being sprayed on his legs, this is difficult; <b>after saying to them</b> that it is <b>a prohibition, would he then say to them</b> a practical <b>remedy?</b> By saying that one can avoid urine being sprayed on his legs, Rabbi Eliezer indicated that if one cannot do so he may hold his penis, which contradicts his other statement.
<b>Rather,</b> clearly <b>he said this</b> practical solution <b>to</b> the Rabbis <b>first, and they</b> then <b>said to him:</b> If <b>one does not have an elevated place or loose earth</b> upon which he can urinate, <b>what</b> should he do? In response to this question, <b>he said to them: It is preferable</b> that people <b>cast aspersions about his children that they are <i>mamzerim</i>, and he should not render himself wicked</b> even <b>one moment before the Omnipresent.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why must one refrain <b>to that extent</b> from holding his penis? <b>Because</b> as the result of holding his penis <b>he</b> might <b>emit semen for naught. As Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Anyone who emits semen for naught is liable</b> to receive the punishment of <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to Onan, son of Judah: “And it came to pass, when he engaged in intercourse with his brother’s wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother. <b>And the thing that he did was evil in the eyes of the Lord, and He slew him also”</b> (Genesis 38:9–10).
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak and Rabbi Ami say:</b> One who emits semen for naught is considered <b>as though he sheds blood, as it is stated:</b> “But draw near here, you sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the harlot…Are you not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood, <b>you that inflame yourselves among the terebinths, under every leafy tree, that slay [<i>shoḥatei</i>] the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?”</b> (Isaiah 57:3–5). <b>Do not read</b> this word as <b><i>shoḥatei</i>; rather,</b> read it as <b><i>soḥatei</i>,</b> i.e., one who squeezes out [<i>soḥet</i>] semen is considered to have shed the blood of the children who could have been born from that seed.
<b>Rav Asi says:</b> It is considered <b>as though he worships idols,</b> as <b>it is written here: “Under every leafy tree,” and it is written there,</b> with regard to the mitzva of eradicating idols from Eretz Yisrael: “You shall destroy all the places, where the nations that you are to dispossess worshipped their gods, <b>upon the high mountains,</b> and upon the hills, <b>and under every leafy tree”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:2).
§ With regard to the issue of holding one’s penis for the purpose of urinating, the Gemara relates that <b>Rav Yehuda and Shmuel were standing on the roof of the synagogue that was destroyed and rebuilt in Neharde’a. Rav Yehuda said to Shmuel:</b> What can I do? <b>I need to urinate.</b> Shmuel <b>said to him: <i>Shinnana</i>, hold your penis,</b> so that the water does not fall onto the synagogue roof, <b>and urinate outward,</b> away from the synagogue.
The Gemara asks: <b>How could</b> Rav Yehuda <b>do so? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who holds his penis and urinates,</b> it is considered <b>as though he is bringing a flood to the world?</b>
<b>Abaye says:</b> The Sages <b>rendered</b> the halakhic status of this situation <b>like</b> that of <b>a troop of marauders, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Avoda Zara</i> 70b): With regard to <b>a troop of marauders that entered a town,</b> if they did so <b>in a time of peace, open casks</b> of wine <b>are forbidden,</b> in case the marauders used the wine for libations in idol worship, whereas <b>sealed</b> casks <b>are permitted. In a time of war,</b> both <b>these and those are permitted, because</b> the marauders <b>do not have leisure to pour libations. Evidently, since</b> these marauders <b>are afraid, they will not come to pour libations. Here too,</b> in this incident involving Rav Yehuda, <b>since he is afraid he will not come to have</b> sexual <b>thoughts.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And what fear is there here,</b> in the case of Rav Yehuda? The Gemara explains: <b>If you wish, say</b> that there is <b>the fear of the night and of the roof,</b> i.e., that he might fall. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>the awe of his teacher,</b> Shmuel, is upon him. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>the awe of the Divine Presence</b> that dwells in the synagogue is upon Rav Yehuda. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>the awe of his Master,</b> God, is upon him. Rav Yehuda was renowned for his fear of Heaven, <b>as Shmuel declared about</b> him: <b>This one is not born of a woman,</b> but is like an angel.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> a different answer, that Rav Yehuda was allowed to hold his penis while urinating because he <b>was married; as Rav Naḥman said: If one is married,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> for him to hold his penis while urinating, as his improper sexual urges are not as strong.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> that Shmuel <b>ruled for</b> Rav Yehuda <b>in accordance with this</b> <i>baraita</i>, <b>which Abba, son of Rabbi Binyamin bar Ḥiyya, teaches:</b> One may not hold the penis itself while urinating, <b>but</b> a man who wishes to urinate <b>may assist</b> the process <b>by</b> holding the <b>testicles from below.</b> Shmuel instructed Rav Yehuda to act in this manner. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>Shmuel ruled</b> for Rav Yehuda <b>in accordance with that which Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: There is</b> a clear <b>demarcation</b> in the prohibition against holding one’s penis while urinating: <b>From the corona and below,</b> toward the tip of the penis, it is <b>permitted</b> to hold, as this will not lead to arousal.

Daf 13b

<b>From the corona and above,</b> toward the body, it is <b>prohibited.</b>
§ <b>Rav says: One who intentionally causes himself an erection shall be ostracized.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>And let</b> Rav <b>say</b> simply that it is <b>prohibited.</b> The Gemara explains that it is proper to ostracize such a man, <b>as he arouses the evil inclination upon himself. And Rabbi Ami says: He is called</b> a habitual <b>transgressor, as this is the craft of the evil inclination. Today he says to</b> a person: <b>Do this</b> sin, <b>and</b> when the individual obeys his inclination, <b>on the following day</b> the evil inclination <b>says to him: Do that</b> sin, <b>and on the following day he says to him: Go</b> and <b>worship idols, and he goes and worships</b> idols.
<b>Some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who brings himself into</b> a state of <b>arousal,</b> they <b>do not bring him within the boundary of the Holy One, Blessed be He.</b> The proof is that <b>it is written here,</b> with regard to Onan, son of Judah: <b>“And the thing that he did was evil in the eyes of the Lord,</b> and He slew him also” (Genesis 38:10), <b>and it is written there: “For You are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness; evil shall not sojourn with You.</b> The boasters shall not stand in Your sight…But as for me, in the abundance of Your kindness will I come into Your house; I will bow down toward Your holy Temple in fear of You” (Psalms 5:5–8). This demonstrates that whoever does evil, like Onan, shall not sojourn with God.
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says,</b> with regard to the severity of this transgression: <b>What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “And when you spread forth your hands, I will hide My eyes from you; even when you make many prayers, I will not hear; <b>your hands are full of blood”</b> (Isaiah 1:15)? <b>These are</b> those men <b>who commit adultery with the hand,</b> by masturbating. Likewise, <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> When it is stated in the Ten Commandments: <b>“You shall not commit adultery”</b> (Exodus 20:13), this means that <b>there shall not be adultery among you, whether</b> you masturbate <b>by hand</b> or <b>whether with</b> one’s <b>foot.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Converts and those who play with children delay</b> the coming of <b>the Messiah.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted</b> with regard to <b>converts,</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥelbo, as Rabbi Ḥelbo says: Converts are as harmful to the Jewish people as a leprous scab</b> on the skin, as they are not proficient in the performance of the mitzvot and born Jews learn from them. <b>But</b> with regard to the category of <b>those who play with children,</b> to <b>what is it</b> referring?
<b>If we say</b> that this is referring to <b>homosexuality,</b> such men <b>are liable to</b> be executed by <b>stoning,</b> and their behavior is criticized not simply because they delay the Messiah. <b>Rather,</b> one might suggest that this is referring to those who emit semen <b>by way of</b> other <b>limbs,</b> i.e., without engaging in intercourse; if so, <b>they are</b> considered as though they are bringing a flood, and are therefore <b>liable to</b> be punished themselves with <b>a flood.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means <b>that they marry minor girls who are not</b> yet <b>capable of bearing children,</b> consequently emitting semen for naught. <b>As Rabbi Yosei said: The</b> Messiah, <b>son of David, will not come until all the souls of the body have been finished,</b> i.e., until all souls that are destined to inhabit physical bodies do so. <b>As it is stated: “For the spirit that enwraps itself is from Me, and the souls that I have made”</b> (Isaiah 57:16). The verse is interpreted as follows: The spirit, i.e., the souls about which it has been decreed by Me that they are to be born, if they are not born, they enwrap the Messiah and prevent him from coming.
§ The mishna teaches that with regard to any hand that is diligent to examine bodily emissions, <b>among men,</b> such a hand <b>should be severed. A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Do we learn</b> this statement as a practical <b><i>halakha</i>,</b> i.e., that the court should actually sever his hand, <b>or do we learn</b> it as a mere <b>curse,</b> but not as an actual instruction to punish him in that manner? The Gemara elaborates: <b>Do we learn</b> it as a practical <b><i>halakha</i> like that</b> prohibition against striking another, in which the same expression is used: With regard to anyone who raises his hand upon another, his hand should be severed, and <b>Rav Huna</b> indeed acted accordingly and <b>severed the hand</b> of an offender? <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>do we learn</b> it as a mere <b>curse?</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Tarfon says:</b> If one’s <b>hand</b> goes <b>to</b> his <b>penis, his hand should be severed upon his navel.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> If so, in a case where <b>a thorn was stuck in</b> one’s <b>belly, should he not remove it?</b> Rabbi Tarfon <b>said to them:</b> Indeed, he should <b>not</b> remove it, and if he does so his hand should be severed. The Rabbis replied: <b>But</b> if his hand is severed while it is upon his navel, <b>won’t his belly be split open?</b> Rabbi Tarfon <b>said to them: It is preferable that the belly of</b> one who acts in this manner <b>should be split open, and he should not descend into the pit of destruction.</b>
The Gemara analyzes this discussion: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>we learn</b> the statement in the mishna as a practical <b><i>halakha</i>, this is</b> the meaning of that <b>which</b> the Rabbis <b>said: But</b> if his hand is severed upon his navel, <b>won’t his belly be split open? But if you say</b> that <b>we learn</b> the statement in the mishna as a mere <b>curse, what</b> is the meaning of the phrase: Won’t <b>his belly be split open?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Rather, what</b> explanation is the alternative? That <b>we learn</b> the mishna as stating a practical <b><i>halakha</i>?</b> That would not explain the exchange between the Rabbis to Rabbi Tarfon, because is it <b>not sufficient that</b> the hand be severed <b>not upon his navel?</b> In other words, even if the hand must actually be severed, it is not clear why it should be severed while it is upon his navel.
<b>Rather, this</b> is what <b>Rabbi Tarfon is saying:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who inserts his hand below his navel,</b> his hand <b>should be severed.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Tarfon:</b> If <b>a thorn was stuck in</b> one’s <b>belly, should he not remove it?</b> Rabbi Tarfon <b>said to them:</b> He should <b>not.</b> They responded: <b>But won’t his belly be split open</b> due to the thorn? Rabbi Tarfon <b>said to them: It is preferable that his belly be split open, and he should not descend into the pit of destruction.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of a woman <b>who is deaf [<i>haḥereshet</i>], or an imbecile, or blind, or who went insane,</b> and is therefore unable to examine herself reliably, <b>if</b> such women <b>have competent</b> friends, those friends <b>prepare them</b> by examining them and immersing them in a ritual bath. <b>And</b> on that basis the incompetent women <b>may partake of <i>teruma</i></b> after the sun sets.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that competent women must assist <b>a deaf woman.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Let her examine herself; as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: There was a deaf woman in our neighborhood</b> who was so proficient in these matters that <b>not only did she examine herself, but</b> when <b>her friends would see</b> stains similar to blood <b>and</b> were unsure whether or not the stains were ritually impure, they would <b>show her</b> the stains.
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi is referring <b>to</b> a woman who <b>can speak but cannot hear.</b> It is possible for such a woman to be an expert in examining blood. But <b>here,</b> the mishna is dealing <b>with</b> a woman <b>who can neither speak nor hear,</b> and she is therefore considered incompetent and incapable of examining herself. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 1:2): The <b>deaf person</b> of <b>whom the Sages spoke everywhere</b> is one <b>who can neither hear nor speak,</b> i.e., a deaf-mute.
§ The mishna further teaches that competent women must assist <b>a blind</b> woman. The Gemara similarly asks: <b>Let her examine herself and show</b> the cloth <b>to her friend. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> The correct version of the <b>mishna</b> does <b>not</b> mention <b>a blind</b> woman.
§ The mishna also states that competent women must assist <b>a woman who went insane.</b> The Gemara asks: With regard to her ability to examine herself, <b>isn’t this</b> the same as <b>an imbecile,</b> who is already mentioned in the mishna? The Gemara answers: Here, the mishna is referring to a woman <b>who went insane due to illness,</b> which is a different category than that of an imbecile.
The Gemara further discusses <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to an imbecile. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>an imbecile priest</b> who was ritually impure, competent men deal with his purification: <b>They immerse him, and</b> then <b>enable him to partake of <i>teruma</i> in the evening,</b> like any other priest who was impure. <b>And</b> those taking care of him must <b>watch over him</b> to ensure <b>that he does not sleep</b> before he partakes of <i>teruma</i>, in case he experiences a seminal emission, which would render him impure. If <b>he slept,</b> he is once again <b>impure,</b> and may not partake of <i>teruma</i>; if he <b>did not sleep</b> he is <b>pure.</b>
<b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says</b> that there is another method of allowing an imbecile priest to partake of <i>teruma</i>: <b>One prepares for him a leather pouch,</b> which is wrapped around his penis, and before giving him <i>teruma</i> to partake of one checks this pouch to see if he has emitted semen. The other Sages <b>said to him:</b> It is improper to do this, as <b>all the more so</b> he will be prevented from partaking of <i>teruma</i>; this pouch <b>warms him</b> and increases the likelihood of a seminal emission. Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, <b>said to them: According to your statement, an imbecile</b> priest <b>has no remedy</b> that will enable him to partake of <i>teruma</i>.
<b>They said to him: According to our statement</b> there is a way he can partake of <i>teruma</i>, as stated above: If <b>he slept,</b> he is <b>impure;</b> if he <b>did not sleep</b> he is <b>pure.</b> But <b>according to your statement,</b> that one wraps a pouch around his penis, this is not a reliable method, as <b>perhaps he will see,</b> i.e., experience the emission of, <b>a drop</b> of semen as small <b>as a mustard</b> seed, <b>and it will be absorbed in the pouch</b> and will not be noticed, which would mean that he is eating <i>teruma</i> in a state of ritual impurity.
The Gemara continues to discuss the methods by which an imbecile priest can partake of <i>teruma</i>. It was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the Sages <b>said in the name of Rabbi Elazar: One prepares for him a metal pouch,</b> which is placed on his penis and does not warm it.
In explanation of this statement, <b>Abaye says: And</b> when this <i>tanna</i> speaks of metal, he means that the pouch should be made <b>of copper,</b> which does not absorb liquid, and therefore any drop of semen would be visible. This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 12:5), with regard to the amount of water of purification that must be sprinkled on an individual who is impure due to impurity imparted by a corpse, that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One considers those hyssop stems,</b> with which the waters of purification are sprinkled, <b>as though they are</b> made <b>of copper,</b> which does not absorb any of the water.
<b>Rav Pappa says:</b> One can <b>learn from</b> the statement of the Rabbis that a pouch wrapped around one’s penis can warm it enough to cause a seminal emission, that <b>trousers are prohibited</b> to be worn, as they too warm the penis, by being placed so they are tight against it. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written</b> with regard to the priestly garments: <b>“And you shall make them linen trousers to cover the flesh of their nakedness,</b> from the loins even to the thighs they shall reach” (Exodus 28:42)?
The Gemara explains: <b>That</b> garment, the trousers worn by priests, was different, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The trousers of priests, to what are they comparable?</b> They are <b>similar to riding trousers [<i>pamalanya</i>] of horsemen,</b> and this is what they look like: <b>Above,</b> they reach <b>up to</b> the <b>loins; below,</b> they go <b>down to</b> the <b>thighs, and they have straps, and they have no opening,</b> neither <b>at the back nor at the front.</b>
<b>Abaye says:</b>

Daf 14a

<b>It is prohibited for camel riders to partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> due to the concern for a seminal emission that might result from the friction. The Gemara notes: <b>This</b> opinion of Abaye <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Camel riders are all wicked,</b> as they are suspected of emitting semen for naught. <b>Sailors are all righteous,</b> because they are in a constant state of danger at sea, and therefore their hearts are always turned to God in prayer.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: As for <b>donkey drivers,</b> some <b>of them are wicked</b> while some <b>of them are righteous.</b> With regard to the difference between wicked and righteous donkey drivers, <b>there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>this</b> donkey driver is righteous, <b>as</b> his donkey <b>is saddled,</b> and therefore his penis does not rub against it, whereas <b>that</b> donkey driver is wicked, <b>as</b> his donkey <b>is not saddled,</b> which can cause a seminal emission. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say: This</b> donkey driver is wicked, <b>as he spreads [<i>demittartein</i>]</b> his thighs on either side of the donkey, whereas <b>that</b> donkey driver is righteous <b>as he does not spread</b> his thighs in this manner, but rides with both legs on one side of the donkey, so that his penis does not rub against the donkey.
The Gemara further discusses actions that are apt to lead to a seminal emission. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi would curse one who sleeps lying on his back [<i>aparkeid</i>],</b> as this might lead to a seminal emission. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Rav Yosef say:</b> One who is <b>lying on his back may not recite <i>Shema</i>?</b> From this it may be inferred that <b>it is only <i>Shema</i> that one may not recite</b> in this position, <b>but</b> to sleep <b>lying</b> in that position is <b>permitted.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>With regard to</b> the prohibition against <b>sleeping</b> while lying on one’s back, <b>when one leans slightly</b> to the side it is <b>permitted.</b> But <b>with regard to reciting <i>Shema</i></b> while lying face upward, even <b>when one leans slightly</b> to the side it is <b>prohibited.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But wouldn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> lie on his back <b>leaning slightly</b> to the side <b>and recite <i>Shema</i></b> in this manner? The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan is different, as he was corpulent,</b> and consequently he could lean only slightly.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> It is <b>the custom of Jewish women</b> that <b>they engage in intercourse</b> with their husbands <b>while</b> using <b>two examination cloths, one for</b> the husband, to see if there is any of the wife’s blood on him after intercourse, <b>and one for her,</b> to ascertain after intercourse whether her menstrual flow has begun. <b>And the modest</b> women <b>prepare a third</b> examination cloth, <b>to</b> examine themselves and <b>prepare</b> the pubic <b>area</b> for intercourse.
If blood <b>was found on his</b> cloth, the woman and her husband are both <b>ritually impure</b> for seven days, in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> of a menstruating woman and of one who engages in intercourse with a menstruating woman, <b>and are</b> each <b>liable to</b> bring a sin <b>offering</b> for unwittingly performing an action punishable with excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>]. If blood <b>was found on her</b> cloth <b>immediately [<i>otyom</i>]</b> after intercourse, the woman and her husband are likewise <b>ritually impure</b> for seven days <b>and are</b> each <b>liable to</b> bring a sin <b>offering.</b> If blood <b>was found on her</b> cloth <b>after time</b> passed, they are both <b>ritually impure due to uncertainty,</b> as it is possible that the blood appeared only after intercourse, <b>and they are exempt from</b> bringing <b>the</b> sin <b>offering.</b>
<b>What is</b> considered as being: <b>After time</b> passed? It is a period of time <b>equivalent to</b> the time needed <b>for her to descend from the bed and rinse her face,</b> a euphemism for her pubic area. <b>And afterward, she</b> retroactively <b>transmits impurity</b> to all ritually pure items with which she came into contact <b>for</b> the preceding twenty-four-hour <b>period,</b> by rabbinic law, <b>but she does not transmit</b> seven-day <b>impurity to the man with whom she engaged in intercourse.</b> He is impure with this impurity by rabbinic law only until the evening, like one who came in contact with a menstruating woman. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> In the case where blood was found on her cloth after time passed, <b>she even transmits</b> seven-day <b>impurity</b> by rabbinic law <b>to the man with whom she engaged in intercourse.</b>
The mishna concludes: <b>The Rabbis concede to Rabbi Akiva in</b> the case of a woman who <b>sees</b> a blood <b>stain</b> and then engages in intercourse, <b>that she transmits</b> seven-day <b>impurity to the man with whom she engaged in intercourse,</b> although this impurity also applies by rabbinic law.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that if blood is found on the husband’s cloth after intercourse the husband and wife are both definitely impure. The Gemara asks: <b>But let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps it is the blood of a louse,</b> as it is possible that there was a louse in the woman’s pubic area that was squashed during intercourse, and its blood was found on the husband’s penis. Accordingly, it should be uncertain if they are impure. <b>Rabbi Zeira says:</b> There is no concern for this possibility, as <b>that place,</b> a woman’s genitals, <b>is</b> considered <b>examined [<i>baduk</i>] with regard to</b> the appearance of <b>a louse,</b> i.e., it is clear that no louse was there. <b>And some say</b> a different version of Rabbi Zeira’s statement: <b>That place is</b> too <b>narrow [<i>daḥuk</i>] for a louse</b> to enter, and therefore this is not a concern.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> these two versions of Rabbi Zeira’s statement? The Gemara answers: There is a practical difference <b>between them</b> in a case <b>where a squashed louse was found</b> on the husband’s cloth, near the blood: <b>According to this version, which states</b> that a woman’s genitals are considered <b>examined with regard to a louse, this</b> louse certainly <b>came from elsewhere,</b> as a louse is never found in her pubic area, so the blood on the cloth is clearly from the woman, and therefore the couple is ritually impure. By contrast, <b>according to that version, which states</b> that the place <b>is</b> too <b>narrow for a louse</b> to enter, one can <b>say</b> that although it is generally too narrow, in this case one did enter and the man’s <b>organ squashed it</b> during intercourse, and therefore their impurity is uncertain.
It <b>was stated:</b> If the woman <b>examined</b> herself <b>with a cloth that was examined by her</b> before she used it and found free of blood, <b>and</b> after the examination <b>she pressed it against her thigh,</b> and did not look at the cloth, <b>and on the following day she found blood on</b> her thigh, <b>Rav says:</b> In such a case she is definitely <b>impure</b> as <b>a menstruating woman.</b> Since it is known that the cloth was clear of blood before the examination, the blood on her thigh must be from her examination, and it must have passed onto her thigh after the cloth was pressed there. <b>Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya said to</b> Rav: <b>But didn’t you say to us</b> with regard to this case that <b>she</b> needs to be <b>concerned</b> for ritual impurity, which indicates that her impurity is uncertain?
In this regard it <b>was also stated</b> that <b>Shmuel says: She</b> is definitely <b>impure</b> as <b>a menstruating woman. And they likewise rule</b> as a practical <i>halakha</i> in <b>the study hall</b> that this woman is definitely <b>impure</b> as <b>a menstruating woman.</b>
With regard to a similar case, it <b>was stated:</b> If a woman <b>examined</b> herself <b>with a cloth that was not examined by her</b> before its use, <b>and she</b> then <b>placed it in a box</b> without looking at it, <b>and on the following day she found blood on</b> this cloth, the question is whether the blood was on the cloth before the examination and the woman is consequently not impure, or whether the blood is from the examination, and she is impure. <b>Rav Yosef says: All the days of Rabbi Ḥiyya he would deem</b> such a woman <b>impure, but in his old age he would deem</b> her <b>pure.</b>
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages with regard to this statement of Rav Yosef: With regard to <b>what</b> type of impurity status <b>is he speaking?</b> Does he mean that <b>all his days</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>would deem</b> the woman definitely <b>impure as a menstruating woman,</b> and therefore any <i>teruma</i> with which she came into contact required burning; <b>and in his old age he would deem</b> her <b>pure</b> from the definite impurity status of <b>a menstruating woman, but would deem</b> her <b>impure as</b> a woman who discovered <b>a stain,</b> which is an uncertain source of impurity? If so, according to his ruling from his old age any <i>teruma</i> she touches is not burned but may not be eaten.
<b>Or perhaps</b> does Rav Yosef mean that <b>all his days</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>would deem</b> the woman <b>impure</b> as a matter of uncertainty <b>due to</b> the <b>stain, and in his old age he would deem</b> her <b>pure from any</b> type of impurity status?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution for this dilemma, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman <b>examined</b> herself <b>with a cloth that was not examined by her</b> before its use, <b>and she placed it in a box, and on the following day she found blood on</b> this cloth, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: She is</b> definitely <b>impure as a menstruating woman, and Rabbi Ḥiyya says: She is impure</b> as a matter of uncertainty <b>due to</b> the <b>stain.</b>

Daf 14b

<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>Do you not concede that</b> for her to become ritually impure <b>she requires</b> that the size of the blood stain on the cloth be <b>more than</b> the size of <b>a split bean?</b> If the stain is smaller, it is assumed to have been caused by a squashed louse. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: Indeed [<i>aval</i>],</b> that is correct. Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to him: If so, you too render</b> this blood found on the cloth in the box <b>a stain,</b> which renders one impure as a matter of uncertainty. If you had considered it definitely impure, there would have been no distinction between a small stain and a large one.
The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who deems the woman definitely impure in this case, <b>maintains</b> that although <b>we require</b> that the size of the blood stain be <b>more than</b> the size of <b>a split bean,</b> this is necessary only <b>to exclude</b> the possibility that this is <b>the blood of a louse; and since</b> the possibility that it is <b>the blood of a louse has been excluded,</b> as its size is more than that of a split bean, <b>it certainly came from her body,</b> and therefore she is definitely impure.
The Gemara analyzes this statement of Rabbi Ḥiyya with reference to the dilemma under discussion: <b>What, is it not</b> correct to assume that Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>was in his old age</b> when he disagreed with his teacher, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi? He would not have done so when he was young. And if he deemed the woman impure as a matter of uncertainty in his old age, it can be inferred that <b>in his youth he would deem</b> her definitely <b>impure as a menstruating woman.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>conclude from</b> here that this is the case.
§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi would <b>praise Rabbi Ḥama bar Bisa to Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei,</b> by saying <b>that he is a great man.</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>When he comes to you, bring him to me.</b>
<b>When</b> Rabbi Ḥama <b>came</b> before him, Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to him: Ask me</b> about a halakhic <b>matter.</b> Rabbi Ḥama <b>asked him:</b> If a woman <b>examined</b> herself <b>with a cloth that was not examined by her</b> before its use, <b>and she placed it in a box, and on the following day she found blood on</b> this cloth, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to him: Shall I say to you</b> an answer <b>in accordance with the statement of father,</b> Rabbi Yosei, <b>or shall I say to you</b> an answer <b>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? Which would you prefer? Rabbi Ḥama <b>said to him: Say to me</b> an answer <b>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
<b>Rabbi Yishmael said:</b> Is <b>this</b> the one <b>that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>says about him that he is a great man? How can he neglect the statement of the teacher,</b> Rabbi Yosei, <b>and listen to the statement of the student,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi?
The Gemara explains: <b>And Rabbi Ḥama bar Bisa</b> did so because he <b>maintains</b> that the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi is preferable, as <b>he is the head of the yeshiva, and the Sages are frequently in his presence, and</b> due to the constant disputes <b>his statements are sharper</b> than those of Rabbi Yosei, despite the fact that Rabbi Yosei was his teacher.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is this statement of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and what</b> is the statement of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> referred to by Rabbi Yishmael? <b>Rav Adda bar Mattana says</b> that the reference is to that which was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to this case: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems</b> the woman <b>impure and Rabbi Yosei deems</b> her <b>pure.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Zeira says,</b> in explanation of this dispute: <b>When Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deemed</b> the woman <b>impure,</b> he ruled <b>in accordance with</b> the line of reasoning of <b>Rabbi Meir, and when Rabbi Yosei deemed</b> her <b>pure, he deemed</b> her <b>pure in accordance with his own</b> line of reasoning.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a mishna (59b): In the case of <b>a woman who was urinating and saw blood</b> mixed in the urine, <b>Rabbi Meir says: If</b> she urinated while <b>standing,</b> she is <b>impure,</b> as the blood could have originated in the uterus. <b>If</b> she was <b>sitting,</b> she is <b>pure,</b> as the blood is clearly from the urethra.
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: Whether</b> she urinates in <b>this</b> manner, standing, <b>or whether</b> she urinates in <b>that</b> manner, sitting, she is <b>pure.</b> Like Rabbi Meir, who disregards the possibility that the blood originated in the urethra in a case where the woman was standing, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi deems a woman impure in the case where blood is found on the cloth in the box, despite the possibility that it could have been on the cloth before she used it to examine herself. Rabbi Yosei, by contrast, maintains that wherever there is a reasonable uncertainty, the woman is not impure.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: But doesn’t Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, say</b> that <b>when Rabbi Meir deemed</b> the woman <b>impure</b> in the case involving urination, <b>he merely deemed her impure</b> as a matter of uncertainty, <b>due to</b> contact with a blood <b>stain, whereas Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said</b> that in the case involving a stained cloth the woman is definitely impure <b>as a menstruating woman?</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Rav Aḥa, son of Rava: <b>This is what we are saying: When that</b> comment of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, concerning the ruling of Rabbi Meir <b>was stated, it was stated</b> that he deemed the woman impure <b>as a menstruating woman.</b>
§ The mishna states: If blood <b>was found on her</b> cloth <b>immediately</b> after intercourse, the woman and her husband are both <b>ritually impure</b> and are each liable to bring a sin offering. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is</b> the <b>period of time</b> needed for the onset of <b>menstruation,</b> i.e., what is considered to be immediately after intercourse? This is <b>comparable to</b> a male <b>organ and a cloth that are standing alongside the doorpost,</b> i.e., at the entrance to the vagina; <b>at the exit of</b> the <b>organ</b> the <b>cloth</b> immediately <b>enters.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>This is the period of time</b> concerning <b>which</b> the Sages <b>said:</b> During this period any blood on the cloth renders both the woman and the man ritually impure and liable to bring a sin offering. Yet this period is referring only <b>to</b> an external <b>wipe</b> of the pubic area with the cloth after intercourse, to see if there was a flow of blood during intercourse. <b>But</b> this time frame was <b>not</b> stated <b>with regard to</b> a full internal <b>examination.</b> If the woman conducts a full examination of herself, too much time would have passed since the intercourse for the man to be considered definitely impure.
§ The mishna further states: If blood <b>was found on her</b> cloth <b>after time</b> passed, they are both ritually impure due to uncertainty, as it is possible that the blood appeared only after intercourse, and therefore they are exempt from bringing the sin offering. The Gemara notes that it is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>But they are</b> each <b>liable to</b> bring <b>a provisional guilt offering</b> brought by one who is uncertain as to whether he committed a sin that requires a sin offering. The Gemara asks: <b>And the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna, <b>what is the reason</b> that he does not render each of them liable to bring a provisional guilt offering?
The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> of our mishna holds that one is not liable to bring a provisional guilt offering in every case involving the uncertain violation of a prohibition that, were it certain, would render one liable to bring a sin offering. Rather, <b>we require</b> it to be a case akin to that of one <b>piece from two pieces,</b> e.g., one had two pieces of meat before him, one of which was definitely forbidden while the other was permitted, and he does not know for certain which he ate. But when the uncertainty involves a single item, which may or may not have been forbidden, one does not bring a provisional guilt offering. In the case discussed in the mishna there is only one woman, as it is uncertain whether or not engaging in intercourse with her was permitted, which depends on whether menstruation began before or after intercourse.
§ The mishna states: <b>What is</b> considered <b>after time</b> passed? It is a period of time equivalent to the time needed for the woman to descend from the bed and rinse her pubic area. The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is</b> considered <b>after time</b> passed? <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, explained:</b> It is a period <b>equivalent</b> to the time in <b>which she may extend her hand under the cushion or under the blanket and take a cloth and examine</b> herself <b>with it.</b> This is a shorter period than that required for her to get out of bed and rinse her pubic area.
<b>Rav Ḥisda says: What</b> is the meaning of: <b>After,</b> in the mishna? <b>After, after.</b> In other words, this is referring to the period after the period of time mentioned by Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, who said it is after the amount of time it takes for the woman to extend her hand under the cushion and take a cloth and examine herself. The mishna is referring to the period of time that follows the time frame referred to by Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, as: After time passed. If blood is found after this amount of time has elapsed the man is not ritually impure for a seven-day period, but only until evening, according to the Rabbis.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in the mishna <b>with regard to</b> this time period: If blood <b>was found on her</b> cloth <b>after time</b> passed, they are both <b>ritually impure due to uncertainty, and they are exempt from</b> bringing <b>the</b> sin <b>offering.</b> And the mishna continues: <b>What is</b> considered <b>after time</b> passed? It is a period of time <b>equivalent to</b> the time needed <b>for her to descend from the bed and rinse her face,</b> i.e., her pubic area. This indicates that the period of time that follows the ability to perform an immediate examination is that which is mentioned in the mishna, and the mishna is not discussing the third time frame concerning which the husband is impure only until the evening.
The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: What is</b> considered <b>after time</b> passed? It is a period <b>equivalent</b> to the time in <b>which she may extend her hand under the cushion or under the blanket and take a cloth and examine</b> herself <b>with it,</b> as stated by Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok. <b>And</b> with regard to the other time frame, i.e., <b>equivalent to</b> the time needed <b>for her to descend from the bed and rinse her face,</b> i.e., her pubic area, there is <b>a dispute between Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis</b> as to whether the man is impure for seven days or only until the evening.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> with regard to the dispute between Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis, <b>doesn’t</b> the mishna <b>teach: Afterward,</b> which indicates that they disagree concerning blood found in the time period that comes after the period in which she can descend from the bed and rinse her pubic area? The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: And this</b> time frame, i.e., which is equivalent to the time needed for her to descend from the bed and rinse her pubic area, <b>is</b> that period of time labeled: <b>Afterward,</b> with regard to <b>which Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis disagree.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi says</b> a different resolution of the apparent contradiction between the mishna and the <i>baraita</i>: Both <b>this and that are one period,</b> as it all depends on the situation. If the <b>cloth</b> is already <b>in her hand,</b> she does not need to extend her hand, and therefore the time frame is as stated in the mishna: <b>Equivalent to</b> the time needed <b>for her to descend from the bed and rinse her face.</b> If the <b>cloth is not in her hand,</b> the period is <b>equivalent</b> to the time in <b>which she may extend her hand under the cushion or under the blanket and take a cloth and examine</b> herself <b>with it,</b> while she is still in bed.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav Ashi’s interpretation from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is</b> considered <b>after time</b> passed, at which point the blood found on the woman’s cloth renders them both impure as a matter of uncertainty for seven days? About <b>this matter Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, asked the Sages in Usha, and he said to them:</b>

Daf 15a

<b>Perhaps you say in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, that</b> the woman <b>transmits impurity to the man with whom she engaged in intercourse,</b> just as she retroactively transmits impurity to any pure items she touched in the preceding twenty-four-hour period? The Sages of Usha <b>said to</b> Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok: <b>We have not heard</b> this opinion of Rabbi Akiva, i.e., we do not accept it as <i>halakha</i>, and therefore we would like to know what this period of: After time passed, is.
Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, <b>said to them: This</b> is how <b>the Sages of Yavne explained</b> it: As long as the woman <b>did not wait</b> before examining herself after intercourse for a period of time <b>equivalent to</b> the time in <b>which she may descend from the bed and rinse her face, this is</b> considered <b>within</b> the period of <b>time</b> referred to in the mishna as: After time passed. <b>And</b> if blood is found on the cloth she used to examine herself during this period, they are both <b>impure</b> for seven days <b>due to uncertainty, and they are exempt from</b> bringing a sin <b>offering,</b> as this offering is brought only for an unwitting sin that was definitely committed. <b>But they are</b> each <b>obligated to</b> bring <b>a provisional guilt offering.</b>
If <b>she waited</b> before examining herself after intercourse for a period of time <b>equivalent to</b> the time in <b>which she may descend from the bed and rinse her face, this is</b> considered: <b>After time,</b> i.e., after the time frame referred to in the mishna as: After time passed.
In this case, <b>and likewise</b> in a case <b>when she waited for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period or from examination to examination,</b> i.e., she examined herself before intercourse and was pure, and then examined herself within twenty-four hours after intercourse and was impure, <b>the man with whom she engaged in intercourse becomes impure</b> until evening <b>due to contact</b> with a menstruating woman, <b>but he does not become impure</b> for seven days <b>as one who engaged in intercourse</b> with a menstruating woman. <b>Rabbi Akiva says: He even becomes impure</b> for seven days <b>as one who engaged in intercourse</b> with a menstruating woman. <b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, says:</b> In such a case, not only is <b>her husband</b> not impure for seven days, but he is not even deemed impure until evening by rabbinic law. Therefore, if he is a priest <b>he may enter the Sanctuary and burn incense.</b>
The Gemara explains the difficulty with Rav Ashi’s interpretation of the mishna according to this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> who maintains that the period of: After time passed, during which if the woman found blood on her cloth the man with whom she engaged in intercourse is rendered impure for seven days, is equivalent to the time it takes for her to extend her hand and examine herself, <b>this is</b> the reason <b>that the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>pure</b> if she discovered blood after this period has passed.
<b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ashi,</b> who holds that if she has a cloth in her hand then she renders the man with whom she engaged in intercourse impure if she discovers blood within the amount of time it takes for her to descend from the bed and rinse or clean her pubic area with the cloth she is holding in her hand, <b>why do the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>pure</b> if the amount of time that has passed is the time it takes for her to descend and clean her pubic area? She should still render him impure during that time span.
<b>And if you would say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is dealing with a case <b>where</b> the <b>cloth is not in her hand,</b> and for this reason the time period that it is referring to is after the amount of time it would take for the woman to extend her hand and examine herself, this cannot be the case, as if so, the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have</b> taught two cases: <b>A cloth is in her hand, and: A cloth is not in her hand,</b> to differentiate between the situations. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, this <i>baraita</i> poses <b>a difficulty</b> to the opinion of Rav Ashi.
§ The <i>baraita</i> teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, says:</b> If the examination took place following this period called: After time passed, <b>her husband</b> is not ritually impure at all, and therefore if he is a priest he <b>may enter the Sanctuary and burn incense.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And let him derive that</b> the husband is impure because <b>he is one who touched a menstruating woman during</b> the twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> before she discovered blood, as the Sages decreed that pure items touched by a menstruating woman in the twenty-four hours before she noticed the bleeding are impure retroactively.
The Gemara answers that Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, <b>who said</b> the ruling, holds <b>like Shammai, who said</b> in a mishna (2a): For <b>all women, their time is sufficient,</b> i.e., women who discern the emergence of menstrual blood do not need to be concerned that the flow of blood began before they noticed it, and they assume ritual impurity status only from that moment.
The Gemara raises another difficulty with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai: <b>And let him derive</b> that the husband is impure <b>because he is one who experienced a seminal emission.</b> The Gemara answers that he is referring <b>to</b> a case where the husband <b>did not complete his</b> act of <b>intercourse.</b>
§ The mishna states: <b>And the Rabbis concede to Rabbi Akiva in</b> the case of a woman who <b>sees</b> a blood <b>stain,</b> that she transmits seven-day impurity to the man with whom she engaged in intercourse. The Gemara cites a dispute of <i>amora’im</i> in this regard. <b>Rav says</b> that she renders the man with whom she engaged in intercourse impure <b>retroactively, and</b> this <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who maintains that a woman who sees a blood stain renders pure items impure retroactively (see 5a).
<b>And Shmuel says</b> that she does not render him impure retroactively, but only if he engages in intercourse with her <b>from now and onward,</b> i.e., after she sees the blood stain, <b>and</b> this <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that a woman who sees a blood stain renders pure items impure only from that moment onward. The Gemara raises a difficulty with the opinion of Shmuel: Why does the mishna find it necessary to state that she renders him impure <b>from now and onward?</b> Isn’t it <b>obvious?</b>
The Gemara explains that it was necessary for the mishna to state this ruling, <b>lest you say: Since</b> the woman’s retroactive impurity for a twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> is a decree that applies <b>by rabbinic law, and</b> the impurity of blood <b>stains</b> also applies <b>by rabbinic law,</b> one might claim as follows: <b>Just as</b> her retroactive impurity of a twenty-four-hour <b>period does not render impure the man with whom she engaged in intercourse, so too,</b> her blood <b>stains</b> should <b>not render impure the man with whom she engaged in intercourse.</b> Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that she does render him impure from that point onward.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> perhaps one can <b>say</b> that <b>indeed,</b> she does not transmit impurity to him? The Gemara explains that there is a difference between the two types of rabbinic impurity: <b>There,</b> with regard to retroactive impurity, it is <b>not</b> a case of: The <b>slaughtered ox is before you,</b> i.e., the evidence of impurity did not exist at the time, as she had yet to experience menstruation. Therefore, the Sages did not apply the stringency of retroactive impurity to the husband. By contrast, <b>here,</b> with regard to the impurity of blood stains, it <b>is</b> a case of: The <b>slaughtered ox is before you,</b> as blood has appeared on the cloth.
The Gemara notes: <b>And Reish Lakish similarly says,</b> like Rav, that the woman transmits impurity to the man with whom she engaged in intercourse <b>retroactively, and</b> this <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b> But <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says,</b> like Shmuel: She renders him impure <b>from now and onward,</b> i.e., after she sees the blood stain, <b>and</b> this <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All women have the presumptive status of purity for their husbands,</b> and therefore one is not required to ascertain whether his wife is ritually pure before engaging in intercourse with her. Even with regard to husbands <b>returning from a journey,</b> if their wives were ritually pure when they left, <b>their wives have the presumptive status of purity for them.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Why</b> does the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna need <b>to teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> of husbands <b>returning from a journey?</b> In what manner are they different from other husbands? The Gemara explains that it might <b>enter your mind to say: This statement,</b> that women have the presumptive status of purity, applies only in a case <b>where</b> the husband <b>is in the city</b> of his residence, <b>as</b> the woman <b>takes upon herself</b> the responsibility of being ready for her husband at all times, <b>and</b> therefore <b>she examines</b> herself. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where</b> the husband <b>is not in the city, since she does not take upon herself</b> the responsibility of being constantly ready for him, perhaps she should <b>not</b> have the presumptive status of purity. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that even in this case she has a presumptive status of purity.
The Gemara notes that in this regard, <b>Reish Lakish says in the name of Rabbi Yehuda Nesia: And</b> this <i>halakha</i> that the wife of a husband returning from a journey has a presumptive status of purity <b>is</b> applicable only in a case <b>where</b> the husband <b>came and found</b> that his wife was <b>within the days of her</b> projected <b>period,</b> i.e., within thirty days of her previous menstruation. In this case he may assume that she has not yet experienced a new period, and therefore he may rely on her presumptive status of purity. But if he arrived after thirty days had elapsed from her previous menstruation, it is assumed that she experienced menstruation at the usual time and therefore it is not permitted for him to engage in intercourse with her unless she examined herself and found herself pure.
§ With regard to the presumptive status of purity of wives, <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in the case of a woman <b>who does not have</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle. But</b> with regard to a woman <b>who does have</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle, it is prohibited</b> for her husband <b>to engage in intercourse</b> with her.
The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t it the opposite? On the contrary;</b> the <b>reverse</b> claim <b>stands to reason:</b> If the wife <b>does not have</b> a fixed <b>cycle,</b> one can <b>say</b> that perhaps <b>she saw</b> blood, and therefore she should be forbidden to him; whereas if <b>she has</b> a fixed <b>cycle,</b> since <b>her cycle is fixed for her</b> she knows when she will become impure and is presumed to be pure beforehand.
<b>Rather, if</b> Rav Huna’s differentiation <b>was stated,</b> it <b>was stated like this: Rav Huna says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>when the</b> projected <b>time of</b> the woman’s <b>period had not arrived</b> before her husband returned from his journey. <b>But</b> if <b>the</b> projected <b>time of her period had arrived, she is forbidden</b> to him. Rav Huna <b>maintains</b> that the concern for impurity of women at the projected time of their <b>periods</b> applies <b>by Torah law,</b> as this is a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai. If a woman did not examine herself at this time she is presumed to have experienced bleeding, even if she did not sense the emission of blood, though there is no formal obligation to examine herself at this time. Accordingly, a husband returning home from a journey cannot rely on the assumption that his wife has examined herself at the projected time of her period, unless he positively establishes that she has done so.
By contrast, <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says: Even</b> if <b>the</b> projected <b>time of her period had arrived, she is permitted</b> to her husband. Rabba bar bar Ḥana <b>maintains</b> that the concern for impurity of women at the projected time of their <b>periods</b> applies <b>by rabbinic law,</b> and therefore she is not considered to have experienced bleeding, though by rabbinic law she must still examine herself to ascertain that she is pure.
<b>Rav Ashi teaches</b> the opinions of Rav Huna and Rabba bar bar Ḥana <b>like this: Rav Huna says:</b>

Daf 15b

The Sages <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that a woman has a presumptive status of purity to her husband, <b>only</b> in a case <b>where she does not have</b> a menstrual <b>cycle of days</b> alone, <b>but has</b> a menstrual <b>cycle</b> that is determined both <b>by</b> fixed <b>days and by</b> physical actions she might perform, such as <b>jumps.</b> The reason is that <b>since</b> the <b>matter is</b> also <b>dependent on</b> a particular <b>action,</b> one can <b>say</b> that <b>she did not jump and</b> therefore <b>she did not see</b> blood, and consequently she is presumed to be pure. <b>But</b> with regard to a woman who <b>has</b> a menstrual <b>cycle of days</b> alone, and the projected day of her period arrived, <b>it is prohibited for her to engage in intercourse</b> with her husband.
The Gemara explains that Rav Huna <b>maintains</b> that the concern for impurity of women at the projected time of their <b>periods</b> applies <b>by Torah law.</b> Since she has an uncertain status of impurity by Torah law when the projected day of her period arrives, it is permitted for her to engage in intercourse with her husband only after an examination.
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says: Even</b> if <b>she has</b> a menstrual <b>cycle of days</b> alone, <b>she is permitted</b> to her husband. Rabba bar bar Ḥana <b>maintains</b> that the concern for impurity of women at the projected time of their <b>periods</b> applies <b>by rabbinic law.</b> Consequently, she is not considered to have experienced bleeding, though by rabbinic law she should have examined herself to ascertain if she was pure.
<b>Rav Shmuel says in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> With regard to <b>a woman who has</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle,</b> and her husband was away for seven days after the expected onset of her period, at which point he returned home, <b>her husband calculates the days of her cycle; and</b> if in the elapsed time it was possible for her to immerse and purify herself, he can presume that she did so, and <b>he may engage in intercourse with her</b> even without asking her whether she is pure.
<b>Rav Shmuel bar Yeiva said to Rabbi Abba:</b> Did <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan state</b> this ruling <b>even</b> with regard to <b>a young girl, who is embarrassed to</b> go and <b>immerse</b> herself, in which case one can claim that if her husband was away she would not have gone to the ritual bath?
Rabbi Abba <b>said to</b> Rav Shmuel bar Yeiva: <b>Is that to say</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan applied this <i>halakha</i> to all cases? <b>Did Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> that a woman who <b>definitely saw</b> blood is also permitted to her husband? You can <b>say that Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> his ruling with regard to a case where <b>it is uncertain</b> whether the woman <b>saw</b> blood and <b>it is uncertain</b> whether <b>she did not see</b> blood, <b>and</b> therefore her husband may engage in intercourse with her, as one can reason as follows: <b>If you say</b> that <b>she saw</b> blood, one can still <b>say</b> that perhaps <b>she immersed.</b>
<b>But</b> if <b>she definitely saw</b> blood, it is not permitted for the husband to engage in intercourse with her. The reason is: <b>Who is to say that she immersed? It is</b> a conflict between <b>an uncertainty</b> as to whether or not she immersed, <b>and a certainty</b> that she saw blood, <b>and</b> there is a principle that <b>an uncertainty does not override a certainty.</b> In the case of a young girl, since it is uncertain whether she saw blood, and it is uncertain whether she immersed, she is permitted to her husband.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with this principle: <b>And</b> does an uncertainty <b>not</b> override a certainty? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a <i>ḥaver</i> who died and left a storehouse filled with produce, even</b> if the produce was there only <b>that day,</b> it has the <b>presumptive status</b> of produce that was ritually <b>prepared,</b> i.e., properly tithed. This is due to the presumption that the <i>ḥaver</i> tithed the produce himself or instructed others to do so. The Gemara infers: <b>And here,</b> the produce was <b>definitely untithed</b> at the outset, and there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether the <i>ḥaver</i> <b>tithed it,</b> and there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether <b>he did not tithe it. And</b> despite this conflict, <b>the uncertainty</b> whether it was tithed <b>comes and overrides the certainty</b> that it was untithed produce.
The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>There,</b> the conflict that leads to the question with regard to the produce’s status <b>is</b> between <b>certainty and certainty,</b> as the <i>ḥaver</i> certainly tithed the produce. This presumption is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Ḥanina Ḥoza’a; as Rav Ḥanina Ḥoza’a said:</b> There is <b>a presumption with regard to a <i>ḥaver</i> that he does not release an item from his possession that is not</b> ritually <b>prepared.</b>
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that in that case the conflict <b>is</b> between <b>uncertainty and uncertainty,</b> as it is possible that there was never an obligation to tithe this produce, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Oshaya. As Rabbi Oshaya said: A person can employ artifice</b> to circumvent obligations incumbent upon him in dealing <b>with his grain, and bring it into</b> his courtyard <b>in its chaff, so that his animal may eat</b> from it, <b>and</b> this grain <b>is exempt from tithe.</b> Although the obligation to tithe produce applies even to animal fodder, it is permitted to feed one’s animal untithed produce that was brought into one’s home before being fully processed. Consequently, the case involving produce is a conflict between two uncertain factors, as it is uncertain whether or not the owner was obligated to tithe the produce in the first place, and even if he was required to do so, it is uncertain whether or not he tithed it.
The Gemara challenges: <b>And still,</b> is it correct that <b>an uncertainty does not override a certainty? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving the maidservant of a certain olive gatherer [<i>massik</i>] in</b> the city of <b>Rimon, who cast a non-viable newborn into a pit, and a priest came and looked</b> into the pit <b>to ascertain whether</b> the baby was <b>male</b> or <b>whether</b> it was <b>female,</b> as the length of time of a woman’s ritual impurity after childbirth, even if she gave birth to a non-viable newborn, depends on whether the child was male or female (see Leviticus, chapter 12).
<b>And</b> the <b>incident came before the Sages</b> to rule whether or not the priest contracted ritual impurity while standing over the corpse, <b>and they deemed him ritually pure.</b> The basis for this ruling was: <b>Due to</b> the fact <b>that martens and hyenas are common there,</b> it is likely that the body was dragged away before the priest arrived at the pit.
The Gemara explains the challenge from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>And here, where it is certain</b> that the maidservant <b>cast</b> the <b>non-viable newborn</b> into the pit, and it is <b>uncertain</b> whether an animal <b>dragged it</b> away and it is <b>uncertain</b> whether <b>no</b> animal <b>dragged it</b> away, the Sages nevertheless ruled that <b>an uncertainty comes and overrides a certainty.</b>
The Gemara rejects this challenge: <b>Do not say</b> in the <i>baraita</i> <b>that</b> the woman certainly <b>cast a non-viable newborn into a pit; rather, say</b>

Daf 16a

that she cast an item <b>similar to a non-viable newborn</b> into a pit. Perhaps it was not a non-viable newborn; it might simply have been congealed blood, which does not transmit impurity. Therefore, this is a conflict between uncertainty and uncertainty. It is unclear whether there was anything in the pit that could have rendered the priest ritually impure, and even if there was, it might already have been dragged away.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: And a priest came and looked into the pit <b>to ascertain whether</b> it was <b>male</b> or <b>whether</b> it was <b>female?</b> This indicates that the only uncertainty was with regard to its sex; it was certainly a non-viable newborn.
The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: And a priest came and glanced at</b> the baby <b>to ascertain whether</b> the woman <b>discharged a non-viable newborn,</b> or <b>whether she discharged an amorphous mass. And if you say</b> that <b>she discharged a non-viable newborn,</b> he sought <b>to ascertain whether</b> it was <b>male</b> or <b>whether</b> it was <b>female.</b>
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that this was not a conflict between certainty and uncertainty; rather, it was between two certainties. <b>Since martens and hyenas are common there, they certainly dragged it</b> away immediately. Consequently, the ruling in this case does not contradict the principle that an uncertainty does not override a certainty.
§ The Gemara returns to the issue of a woman’s examination at the projected time of her period. The Sages <b>asked Rav Naḥman:</b> Does the concern for impurity of women at the projected time of their <b>periods,</b> and in turn the obligation for her to perform an examination at that time, apply <b>by Torah law?</b> If so, if a woman did not examine herself she is ritually impure, even if she later examined herself and did not find any blood, as it is assumed that she emitted blood without her seeing it. <b>Or</b> perhaps the concern for impurity of women at the projected time of their periods, and in turn the obligation for her to perform an examination at that time, applies <b>by rabbinic law?</b> If so, a woman who did not examine herself at the time and did not sense the emission of blood can still examine herself after that time and would be ritually pure.
Rav Naḥman <b>said to them:</b> A resolution can be found for your dilemma <b>from that which Huna our colleague said in the name of Rav:</b> With regard to <b>a woman who has</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle, and the</b> projected <b>time of her period arrived and she did not examine herself, and ultimately,</b> when she did examine herself, <b>she saw</b> blood, the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>she must be concerned for</b> ritual impurity from the projected time of <b>her period</b> and that therefore any pure items she touched since then are impure. <b>And</b> additionally, <b>she must be concerned</b> for ritual impurity with regard to the twenty-four hours prior <b>to her seeing</b> the blood, and any items she touched during those twenty-four hours are impure, even if she saw the blood a short while after the projected time of her period. <b>Evidently,</b> the concern for impurity of women at the projected time of their <b>periods</b> applies <b>by Torah law,</b> which is why the <i>halakha</i> is stringent.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>this is what</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> the other Sages: The <b>reason</b> for Rav’s ruling that pure items she touched are retroactively considered impure is <b>that</b> she ultimately <b>saw</b> blood, from which it may be inferred that if <b>she did not see</b> blood, one is <b>not concerned</b> about the status of pure items that she touched from the projected time of her period, despite the fact that she neglected to examine herself at the time. <b>Evidently,</b> the concern for impurity of women at the projected time of their <b>periods</b> applies <b>by rabbinic law.</b>
§ Since the Gemara mentioned Rav’s ruling it cites the dispute between Rav and Shmuel with regard to this <i>halakha</i>. It <b>was stated</b> that these <i>amora’im</i> disagree about <b>a woman who has</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle, and the</b> projected <b>time of her period arrived and she did not examine herself, and ultimately she examined</b> herself. <b>Rav says:</b> If <b>she examined</b> herself at this later time <b>and found</b> that she was <b>ritually impure, she is impure;</b> and if she found that she was <b>pure, she is pure. And Shmuel says: Even</b> if <b>she</b> later <b>examined</b> herself <b>and found</b> that she was <b>pure, she is impure.</b> This is <b>because</b> the <b>manner</b> of women, i.e., a women’s menstrual period, <b>comes at its</b> usual <b>time.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that Rav and Shmuel <b>disagree with regard to</b> the concern for impurity of women at the pro-jected time of their <b>periods? As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Shmuel, who rules that the woman is impure in both cases, <b>holds</b> that this concern for impurity applies <b>by Torah law, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav, who says that if her subsequent examination came out clean then she remains pure, <b>holds</b> that this concern for impurity applies <b>by rabbinic law.</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira says:</b> It is possible <b>that everyone,</b> even Rav, agrees that the concern for impurity of women at the projected time of their <b>periods</b> applies <b>by Torah law,</b> and the reason Rav deems the woman pure in this case is that <b>here</b> it is a situation <b>where she examined herself within the period of time</b> needed for the onset of <b>menstruation,</b> i.e., very close to the projected time of her period, and therefore it is assumed that if there was blood at the projected time of her period she would have seen it upon this examination. By contrast, <b>there,</b> in other cases of subsequent examinations, <b>she did not examine herself within the period of time</b> needed for the onset of <b>menstruation.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says:</b> Actually, Rav and Shmuel <b>disagree with regard to</b> the matter of the projected time of their <b>periods itself, as</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Shmuel, <b>holds</b> that the concern for impurity of women at the projected time of their <b>periods</b> applies <b>by Torah law, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav, <b>holds</b> that the concern for impurity of women at the projected time of their <b>periods</b> applies <b>by rabbinic law.</b>
The Gemara continues to discuss this dispute between Rav and Shmuel. <b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> This disagreement between Rav and Shmuel is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>: Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that a woman who has a fixed menstrual cycle but who did not examine herself at the projected time of her period <b>is ritually impure as a menstruating woman,</b> which indicates that in his opinion the examination at the projected time of a woman’s period applies by Torah law.
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua says</b> that <b>she should be examined</b> now, despite the elapsed time, and if the examination came out clean she is pure retroactively as well. Apparently, Rabbi Yehoshua maintains that this examination applies by rabbinic law. The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> the dispute of <b>these <i>tanna’im</i> is parallel to</b> the dispute of <b>those <i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir says: She is ritually impure as a menstruating woman, and the Rabbis say: She should be examined</b> now.
<b>Abaye said: We, too, learn</b> likewise in a mishna, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (39a): <b>Rabbi Meir says: If</b> a woman <b>was in hiding</b> from danger, <b>and the</b> projected <b>time of her period arrived and she did not examine</b> herself, nevertheless she is <b>ritually pure, as</b> it may be assumed that she did not experience bleeding because <b>fear dispels</b> the flow of menstrual <b>blood,</b> and therefore there is no concern that she might have emitted blood without sensing it. By inference, <b>the reason</b> she is pure is <b>that there is fear</b> of danger; <b>but</b> if <b>there is no fear</b> upon this woman, <b>she is impure. Evidently,</b> Rabbi Meir maintains that the concern for impurity of women at the projected time of their <b>periods</b> applies <b>by Torah law.</b>
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>these</b> following <b><i>tanna’im</i> also disagree with regard to this</b> matter of whether the examination at the projected time of a woman’s period is required by Torah law? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a woman <b>who sees blood due to a wound</b> in her pubic area, <b>even</b> if she saw the blood <b>during the days of her menstruation,</b> including the projected time of her period, <b>she is pure,</b> as it is assumed that the blood came from the wound; this is <b>the statement of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b>
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that if the woman does not have a fixed menstrual cycle then the blood can be attributed to the wound. But <b>if she has</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle,</b> and she saw blood on the projected day of her period, even if the blood was from the wound <b>she must be concerned that</b> blood from <b>her period</b> might be mixed with this blood from the wound, and must therefore observe impurity status.
The Gemara clarifies its suggestion: <b>What, is it not</b> the case that these Sages <b>disagree with regard to this</b> matter, i.e., <b>that</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds</b> that the concern for impurity of women at the projected time of their <b>periods</b> applies <b>by Torah law,</b> and though she can examine herself and ascertain that she is pure, if she did not she is presumed impure, and therefore he is stringent in the case of a woman who has a fixed menstrual cycle; <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <b>holds</b> that the concern for impurity of women at the projected time of their <b>periods</b> applies <b>by rabbinic law,</b> and consequently he rules leniently even with regard to a woman who has a fixed cycle?
<b>Ravina says: No;</b> they do not necessarily disagree with regard to this point, as it is possible <b>that everyone,</b> even Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, agrees that the concern for impurity of women at the projected time of their <b>periods</b> applies <b>by rabbinic law, and here they disagree</b> as <b>to</b> whether <b>the location of</b> a woman’s <b>source,</b> i.e., her uterus, <b>is impure,</b> and therefore any blood that passes through there is impure, even if it is blood from a wound.
<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds</b> that the <b>woman</b> herself <b>is pure</b> from the seven-day impurity status of a menstruating woman, as the requirement of an examination upon the projected time of her period applies by rabbinic law, <b>but</b> the <b>blood is impure,</b> even if it is from a wound, <b>as it came through</b> her <b>source,</b> and was thereby rendered impure. Consequently, the blood renders the woman impure until the evening.
<b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel: <b>If you are concerned</b> due <b>to</b> the possibility that this is blood of her menstrual <b>period,</b> then the <b>woman</b> should <b>also</b> be <b>impure</b> as a menstruating woman. <b>And if you are not concerned</b> due <b>to</b> the possibility that this is blood of her menstrual <b>period,</b> then her <b>source</b> does not transmit impurity to the blood that passes through <b>its location,</b> as that blood <b>is pure.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> A woman is <b>required</b> to examine herself with <b>two cloths,</b> once before and once after <b>each and every</b> act of <b>intercourse</b> in which she engages throughout the night, and she must inspect them for blood the following morning, <b>or</b> she must <b>engage in intercourse by the light of a lamp</b> and inspect the cloths before and after each act of intercourse. <b>Beit Hillel say:</b> She is not required to examine herself between each act of intercourse. Rather, it is <b>sufficient</b> for her to examine herself <b>with two cloths throughout the night,</b> once before the first act of intercourse and once after the final act of intercourse.

Daf 16b

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that according to Beit Shammai it is permitted to engage in intercourse by the light of a lamp. In this regard, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Even though</b> the Sages <b>said</b> with regard to <b>one who engages in intercourse by the light of a lamp,</b> that <b>this is disgraceful, Beit Shammai say: A woman is required</b> to examine herself with <b>two cloths,</b> once before and once after <b>each</b> act of <b>intercourse, or</b> she must <b>engage in intercourse by the light of a lamp. And Beit Hillel say:</b> It is <b>sufficient</b> for her to examine herself <b>with two cloths throughout the night,</b> once before the first act of intercourse and once after the final act of intercourse.
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Beit Shammai said to Beit Hillel: According to your statement</b> that a woman may engage in intercourse several times in one night without an examination between each act of intercourse, <b>let us be concerned lest she will see,</b> i.e., emit, <b>a drop of blood the size of a mustard</b> seed <b>during the first</b> act of <b>intercourse,</b> and will thereby become impure, <b>and semen from the second</b> act of <b>intercourse will cover it.</b> Since the examination after the last act of intercourse will not reveal the drop of blood, the woman will erroneously think she is pure.
<b>Beit Hillel said to them</b> in response: <b>Even according to your statement, let us be concerned</b> that <b>while the saliva</b> was still <b>in the mouth,</b> i.e., while the blood was in her vagina, <b>perhaps it was squashed and disappeared.</b> Even if she examines herself after each act of intercourse, as mandated by Beit Shammai, it is possible that the semen of that act covered the blood, and it will not be revealed by the examination.
Beit Shammai <b>said to</b> Beit Hillel: One cannot compare the two situations, <b>as a squashed</b> drop of blood after the woman has engaged in intercourse <b>once is not similar to a squashed</b> drop of blood after the woman has engaged in intercourse <b>twice,</b> and therefore our concern is more reasonable.
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said: I see</b> as correct <b>the statement of Beit Shammai</b> in this case. <b>His students said to him:</b> Our <b>teacher, how you have weighed [<i>he’erakhta</i>] us down</b> with this stringent ruling. Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them: It is preferable that I weigh you down in this world, so that</b> you do not sin by engaging in prohibited intercourse, i.e., so that <b>your days in the World-to-Come will be lengthened [<i>sheya’arikhu</i>].</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Zeira says: From the statements of all of them,</b> i.e., both Beit Shammai, who permit engaging in intercourse a second time only after an examination, and Beit Hillel, who rule that the second examination must be performed only after the final act of intercourse of the night, <b>we can learn</b> that their dispute relates only to that which is permitted after the fact. But <b>a pious person [<i>ba’al nefesh</i>] should not engage in intercourse and repeat</b> his act without an examination between each act.
<b>Rava says:</b> Even a pious person <b>may engage in intercourse and repeat</b> the act without an examination in between, as <b>when that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b> it is referring <b>to</b> a woman who handles <b>pure items.</b> But with regard to intercourse with her husband, there is no cause for concern.
<b>This</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said,</b> i.e., that a woman must examine herself before and after every act of intercourse according to Beit Shammai, or before the first act and after the last act, according to Beit Hillel? It was said <b>with regard to</b> a woman who handles <b>pure items; but</b> a woman <b>is permitted to her husband</b> even without any examination, and he is not required to ask her if she is pure. <b>But in what</b> case <b>is this</b> lenient <b>statement said? When</b> her husband traveled and <b>left her with the presumptive status of ritual purity. But</b> if he <b>left her with the presumptive status of ritual impurity,</b> she remains <b>forever in her presumptive status</b> of impurity <b>until she says to him: I am pure.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ashi says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If a woman <b>examined</b> herself at night <b>with a cloth, and</b> the cloth <b>was</b> then immediately <b>lost, it is prohibited for her to engage in intercourse</b> again <b>until she examines</b> herself with another cloth, as perhaps there was blood on the cloth that was lost. <b>Rabbi Ila objects to this: If</b> this cloth <b>were intact,</b> i.e., if it were not lost, <b>couldn’t</b> this woman <b>engage in intercourse</b> with her husband that night, on the basis that she will examine the cloth only the following day, <b>and</b> isn’t this the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though she does not know</b> at the time of intercourse whether there is blood on the cloth? <b>Now too,</b> although the cloth is lost, <b>let her engage in intercourse</b> with her husband.
<b>Rava said to him:</b> There is a difference between the two cases, as when the cloth is intact, <b>this</b> woman’s <b>proof exists,</b> and if she discovers on the following day that she was impure they will be obligated to bring sin offerings for engaging in intercourse in a state of ritual impurity. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that</b> woman who lost her cloth, <b>her proof does not exist,</b> and therefore they will never know if they require atonement.
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: It is prohibited for a person to engage in intercourse by day. Rav Hamnuna says: What is the verse</b> from which this is derived? <b>As it is stated: “Let the day perish on which I was born, and the night on which it was said: Conceived is a man-child”</b> (Job 3:3). It is derived from here that <b>nighttime is meant for conception, but daytime is not meant for conception. Reish Lakish says</b> that the proof is <b>from here: “But he who despises his ways shall die”</b> (Proverbs 19:16). One might see something unpleasing in his wife in the daylight and come to despise her.
The Gemara asks: <b>And how does Reish Lakish interpret this verse</b> cited <b>by Rabbi Yoḥanan?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>he requires</b> that verse <b>for that which Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa taught. As Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa interpreted</b> that verse in the following manner: <b>That angel that is appointed over conception is called: Night. And</b> that angel <b>takes</b> the <b>drop</b> of semen from which a person will be formed <b>and presents it before the Holy One, Blessed be He, and says before Him: Master of the Universe, what will be of this drop?</b> Will the person fashioned from it be <b>mighty or weak?</b> Will he be <b>clever or stupid?</b> Will he be <b>wealthy or poor?</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>But</b> this angel <b>does not say:</b> Will he be <b>wicked or righteous?</b> This is <b>in accordance with</b> a statement <b>of Rabbi Ḥanina, as Rabbi Ḥanina said: Everything is in the hand of Heaven, except for fear of Heaven.</b> People have free will to serve God or not, <b>as it is stated: “And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God ask of you other than to fear</b> the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 10:12). The fact that God asks of the Jewish people to fear Him indicates that it is a person’s choice to do so.
The Gemara explains: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> derives two <i>halakhot</i> from the verse “and the night on which it was said: Conceived is a man-child,” as he holds as follows: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if it is referring only to the statement of the angel, <b>let the verse write:</b> And the night that said: <b>A man-child is conceived. What</b> is the meaning of: <b>“Conceived is a man-child”?</b> It is derived from the juxtaposition of the word “night” and the word “conceived” that <b>nighttime is meant for conception but daytime is not meant for conception.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan, how does he interpret that verse</b> cited <b>by Reish Lakish?</b> The Gemara answers that Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>requires</b> that verse: “But he who despises his ways shall die,” <b>to</b> teach <b>that which is written in the book of ben Sira: Three</b> people <b>I have hated, and a fourth I have not loved: A minister who frequents [<i>hanirgal</i>] drinking houses,</b> as he disgraces himself and leads himself to ruin and death; <b>and some say</b> a different version of the text: <b>A minister who chats [<i>hanirgan</i>]</b> in drinking houses; <b>and some say</b> a third version: <b>A minister who is short-tempered [<i>hanirgaz</i>]</b> when in drinking houses.
That is the first that he hated. <b>And</b> the others are <b>one who dwells at the highest point of the city,</b> where everyone sees him; <b>and one who holds</b> his <b>penis and urinates. And</b> the fourth, whom he has not loved, is <b>one who enters the house of another suddenly,</b> without warning. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And</b> this includes <b>even</b> one who comes <b>into his</b> own <b>house</b> without prior warning, as the members of his household might be engaged in private activities.
The Gemara cites a similar saying. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: Four matters the Holy One, Blessed be He, hates, and I do not love them,</b> and they are: <b>One who enters his house suddenly, and needless to say</b> one who suddenly enters <b>the house of another; and one who holds</b> his <b>penis and urinates;</b>

Daf 17a

<b>and</b> a man who <b>urinates naked next to his bed; and one who engages in intercourse in the presence of any living being. Rav Yehuda said to Shmuel:</b> Does the phrase: In the presence of any living being, mean <b>even in the presence of mice?</b> Shmuel <b>said to him: <i>Shinnana</i>,</b> that is <b>not</b> the case. <b>Rather,</b> it is referring to a situation <b>such as in so-and-so’s house, where they engage in intercourse in the presence of their</b> Canaanite <b>slaves and maidservants.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And those</b> members of that household, who act in that manner, <b>what</b> verse <b>do they interpret</b> in a manner that allows them to do so? The Gemara answers: They reference the verse in which Abraham said to his two servants: <b>“Remain here with [<i>im</i>] the donkey”</b> (Genesis 22:5). This verse is interpreted as meaning that they are <b>a nation [<i>am</i>] comparable to a donkey.</b> The members of the aforementioned household thought that it is permitted to engage in intercourse in the presence of animals, and therefore one can do so in the presence of his Canaanite slaves and maidservants.
The Gemara cites practices of modesty observed by the Sages. <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna</b> would <b>sound the bells [<i>zagei</i>] of the canopy</b> above his bed when engaging in intercourse, so that people would know to keep away. <b>Abaye</b> would even <b>drive away flies [<i>didevei</i>]</b> from around his bed, so that he would not engage in intercourse in their presence, and <b>Rava</b> would <b>drive away gnats [<i>peruḥei</i>].</b>
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai</b> further <b>says:</b> There are <b>five</b> actions with regard to <b>which one who performs them</b> is held <b>liable for his</b> own <b>life, and his blood is upon his</b> own <b>head,</b> i.e., he bears responsibility for his own demise. They are as follows: <b>One who eats peeled garlic or a peeled onion or a peeled egg, and one who drinks diluted drinks;</b> all these are referring to items only <b>when they were left overnight. And one who sleeps</b> at night <b>in a cemetery, and one who removes his nails and throws them into a public area, and one who lets blood and</b> immediately afterward <b>engages in intercourse.</b>
The Gemara analyzes this statement of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, beginning with the case of <b>one who eats peeled garlic,</b> a peeled onion, or a peeled egg, when they were left overnight. The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> these peeled foods are dangerous <b>even if they are placed in a basket and they are tied and sealed</b> in that basket throughout the night, as <b>an evil spirit rests upon them. And we said</b> that eating them is dangerous <b>only if one did not leave on them their roots or their shells. But</b> if <b>one left on them their roots or their shells, we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b>
Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai further mentions <b>one who drinks diluted drinks that were left overnight. Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: And</b> that <b>is</b> dangerous only <b>when they were left overnight in metal vessels. Rav Pappa says: And natron vessels are considered like metal vessels</b> in this regard. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan likewise says: And</b> that <b>is</b> dangerous only <b>when they were left overnight in metal vessels, and natron vessels are considered like metal vessels</b> in this regard.
Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai also says: <b>And one who sleeps in a cemetery</b> places himself in danger. The Gemara notes that this is the case if he does so <b>in order that a spirit of impurity will rest upon him,</b> as <b>sometimes</b> the evil spirits in the cemetery <b>endanger</b> the one who sleeps there.
The next case is <b>one who removes his nails and throws them into a public area.</b> The Gemara explains that this is dangerous <b>because a pregnant woman</b> might <b>pass over them, and</b> this can cause her to <b>miscarry. And we said</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only when one removes</b> his nails <b>with scissors [<i>bigenosteri</i>]. And</b> furthermore, <b>we said</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only when one removes</b> the nails <b>of his hand and his foot</b> together. <b>And we said</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only when he did not cut anything</b> else <b>after</b> his nails, <b>but</b> if <b>he cut something</b> else <b>after them, we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> that <b>is not so;</b> rather, <b>we are concerned with regard to the entire matter,</b> i.e., in all cases.
With regard to removing one’s nails, <b>the Sages taught: Three matters were stated with regard to</b> removing <b>nails:</b> One who <b>burns them</b> is <b>pious,</b> as he eradicates them entirely; one who <b>buries them</b> is on the slightly lower level of <b>a righteous</b> individual, as they might be dug up; and one who simply <b>throws them</b> where a person might step upon them is <b>wicked.</b>
The Gemara discusses the final clause of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai’s statement: <b>And one who lets blood and</b> immediately afterward <b>engages in intercourse.</b> This is <b>as the Master said:</b> With regard to one who <b>lets blood and</b> afterward <b>engages in intercourse, he will have weak [<i>vittakin</i>] children</b> conceived from this act of intercourse. If <b>both of them,</b> husband and wife, <b>let blood and engaged in intercourse, he will have children afflicted with</b> a disease known as <b><i>ra’atan</i>. Rav says: And we said</b> this <b>only</b> in a case <b>when he did not taste anything</b> after letting blood, <b>but</b> if <b>he tasted something</b> then <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b>
§ <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> It is <b>prohibited for a person to engage in intercourse by day, as it is stated: “And you shall love your fellow as yourself”</b> (Leviticus 19:18). The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is this <b>inferred? Abaye says:</b> If one engages in intercourse by day, <b>perhaps</b> the husband <b>will see some repulsive matter in</b> his wife <b>and she will become repugnant to him,</b> which will cause him to hate her, and he will thereby violate this mitzva. <b>Rav Huna says: Jews are holy, and they do not engage in intercourse by day.</b>
<b>Rava says: And if</b> the <b>house is dark,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to engage in intercourse by day there. <b>And</b> in the case of <b>a Torah scholar, he may cause darkness with his garment and engage in intercourse</b> even during the daytime, as he will certainly do so with modesty.
The Gemara challenges: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>Or</b> she must <b>engage in intercourse by the light of a lamp.</b> This indicates that one may engage in intercourse in the light. The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that the mishna reads: <b>She must examine</b> the cloth <b>by the light of a lamp,</b> but not engage in intercourse in this manner.
The Gemara cites a relevant source. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Even though</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one who engages in intercourse by the light of a lamp is repulsive,</b> nevertheless Beit Shammai say: Or she must engage in intercourse by the light of a lamp and inspect the cloths before and after each act of intercourse. The Gemara similarly explains: <b>Say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> reads: <b>One who examines</b> herself before or after <b>intercourse by the light of a lamp is repulsive,</b> as this examination would not be conducted properly, since the light of the lamp may not be sufficient. Nevertheless Beit Shammai say that a woman who engages in many acts of intercourse in one night must examine the cloth by the light of a lamp.
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And the household of King Munbaz would perform three matters, and</b> the Sages <b>would mention them favorably</b> for their behavior in this regard. <b>They would engage in intercourse by day; and they</b> would <b>examine</b> before and after <b>intercourse with wool [<i>bemeila</i>] of Parhava,</b> which is very white and would show any stain; <b>and they</b> would <b>practice ritual impurity and purity with regard to snow.</b> Regardless of the meaning of the last two matters, <b>in any event</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that they would <b>engage in intercourse by day,</b> which indicates that this practice is not prohibited.
The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that they would <b>examine their beds,</b> i.e., check the examination cloths, <b>by day.</b> The Gemara adds: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> that this is the correct explanation, <b>as if</b> it should <b>enter your mind</b> that it means that they would <b>engage in intercourse</b> by day, even if it is permitted, would the Sages have <b>mentioned them favorably</b> for this practice? The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>Yes,</b> it <b>is indeed so.</b> There is a praiseworthy aspect to engaging in intercourse by day, <b>as</b> at night <b>there is</b> a risk of being <b>overcome by sleep,</b> because the husband might be too tired after the exertions of the day, and <b>consequently</b> his wife who desires sexual intercourse might <b>be repulsive to him.</b>
The Gemara further analyzes the <i>baraita</i>, which teaches: <b>And</b> the household of King Munbaz would <b>examine</b> before and after <b>intercourse, with wool of Parhava.</b> The Gemara notes: This statement <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel, as Shmuel said: One may examine a bed,</b> i.e., use an examination cloth for intercourse, <b>only with</b> a cloth made of <b>linen [<i>befakolin</i>], or with</b> one made of <b>clean and soft wool. Rav says: This is</b> the explanation of <b>that</b> which I heard <b>when I was there,</b> in Eretz Yisrael, <b>on Shabbat evenings,</b> which is the time when Torah scholars engage in intercourse with their wives; people <b>would</b> offer and <b>say: Who needs linen</b> cloths <b>for</b> eating <b>bread [<i>benahama</i>],</b> a euphemism for intercourse. <b>And I did not know what they were saying</b> until now.
<b>Rava says: Those worn-out flax</b> clothes are <b>good for examination.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t the school of Menashe teach: One may not examine a bed with a red cloth, nor with a black cloth, nor with flax, but with</b> a cloth made of <b>linen, or with</b> one made of <b>clean and soft wool?</b>
The Gemara answers that this is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> statement that one may not examine with flax is referring <b>to flax</b> itself, whereas <b>that</b> statement of Rava, that flax is good for an examination, is referring <b>to flax garments. And if you wish, say</b> instead that both <b>this</b> statement <b>and that</b> statement are referring <b>to flax garments,</b> and the difference is that <b>this</b> ruling that one may not use flax is referring <b>to new</b> garments, whereas <b>that</b> ruling of Rava is referring specifically <b>to worn-out</b> garments, which are brighter.
It was further stated that the household of King Munbaz was praised by the Sages because its members would <b>practice ritual impurity and purity with regard to snow.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>We learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>there</b> (see <i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Teharot</i> 2:5): <b>Snow is neither food nor drink</b> with regard to ritual impurity. If <b>one designated it for consumption,</b> his intention is disregarded, and <b>it does not impart the ritual impurity of food.</b> But if one planned to use it as <b>a drink, it imparts the ritual impurity of liquid.</b>
If <b>part of</b> the snow <b>became impure, it does not all become impure,</b> but only the area that came into contact with the item of ritual impurity, as a pile of snow is not considered a single unit. If impure snow in a vessel is lowered into a ritual bath, even if the waters of the ritual bath touched only the snow on the mouth of the vessel, since <b>part of</b> the snow <b>is purified, all of it is purified.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>itself</b> is <b>difficult. You</b> initially <b>said</b> that if <b>part of</b> the snow <b>became impure, it does not all become impure, and then</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that if <b>part of</b> the snow <b>is purified, all of it is purified,</b> which is <b>to say that all of it became impure.</b> In other words, the last clause of the <i>baraita</i> is dealing with a lump of snow all of which is ritually impure, whereas according to the previous clause this is impossible: How could the source of the impurity have touched all of the snow?
<b>Abaye says:</b> It is possible for all the snow to become impure, in a case <b>where one passed</b> the snow <b>within the airspace of</b> an earthenware vessel, such as <b>an oven,</b> in which the source of impurity was located. This renders the entire lump of snow impure, <b>as the Torah testifies with regard to an earthenware vessel</b> that contains a source of impurity that all items inside its airspace are rendered impure, as the verse states: “Whatever is in it shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:33).

Daf 17b

Therefore, <b>even</b> if the earthenware vessel was <b>full</b> of items as small as <b>mustard</b> seeds, only a few of which touched the sides of the vessel or the impure item inside it, all the items inside the vessel are rendered ritually impure. Likewise, with regard to snow that passes through the vessel’s airspace, all of it becomes impure.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A woman’s reproductive organs are composed of different parts, and the halakhic status of blood that emerges from one part differs from the halakhic status of blood that emerges from another part. <b>The Sages stated a parable with regard to</b> the structure of the sexual organs of <b>a woman,</b> based on the structure of a house: <b>The</b> inner <b>room</b> represents the uterus, <b>and the corridor [<i>perozdor</i>]</b> leading to the inner room represents the vaginal canal, <b>and the upper story</b> represents the bladder.
<b>Blood</b> from <b>the</b> inner <b>room is ritually impure. Blood</b> from <b>the upper story is ritually pure.</b> If blood <b>was found in the corridor,</b> there is uncertainty whether it came from the uterus and is impure, or from the bladder and is pure. Despite <b>its</b> state of <b>uncertainty,</b> it is deemed definitely <b>impure, due to</b> the fact <b>that its presumptive status</b> is of blood that came <b>from the source,</b> i.e., the uterus, and not from the bladder.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rami bar Shmuel and Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, were learning</b> tractate <b><i>Nidda</i></b> in <b>the study hall of Rav Huna. Rabba bar Rav Huna found them sitting and saying</b> an interpretation of this mishna: <b>The room,</b> i.e., the uterus, is the <b>inner</b> part of the reproductive organs, <b>and the corridor</b> is the <b>outer</b> part. <b>And the upper story,</b> the bladder, <b>is built,</b> i.e., found, <b>above them both. And</b> there is <b>an open vestibule between</b> the <b>upper story and the corridor.</b>
They continued: If blood is <b>found from</b> the opening of this <b>vestibule and inward</b> toward the uterus, i.e., inside the vagina, there is uncertainty whether it came from the uterus and is impure, or from the bladder and is pure, but <b>its</b> state of <b>uncertainty</b> renders it definitely <b>impure.</b> If it is found in the area <b>from the</b> opening of this <b>vestibule and outward,</b> on the outer surface of the vulva, the blood is more likely to have come from the bladder, through the urethra, and therefore <b>its</b> state of <b>uncertainty</b> renders it <b>pure.</b>
Rabba <b>came and said to his father,</b> Rav Huna: With regard to the <i>halakha</i> of blood that is found from the vestibule and inward, <b>did the Master say to us</b> that <b>its</b> state of <b>uncertainty</b> renders it <b>impure,</b> as I heard in the study hall, from which it may be inferred that this is a case of uncertain impurity? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: The blood is impure <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that its presumptive status</b> is of blood that came <b>from the source,</b> i.e., the uterus? This indicates that it is a case of definite impurity. If so, the mishna cannot be referring either to blood found from the vestibule and inward or from the vestibule and outward.
Rav Huna <b>said to</b> his son Rabba: <b>This is what I said:</b> If the blood was found <b>from the vestibule inward</b> it is <b>definitely impure,</b> as it is presumed to come from the uterus. This is the case mentioned in the mishna. If the blood was found <b>from the vestibule outward its</b> state of <b>uncertainty</b> renders it <b>impure.</b> Although it can be claimed that if this was blood from the uterus it would not have been found in this area, it is possible that when the woman bent over, the blood went from the uterus into this area. Consequently, she is impure due to the uncertainty.
<b>Abaye says: What is different</b> about a situation where the blood was found <b>from the vestibule outward, where its</b> state of <b>uncertainty</b> renders it <b>impure?</b> The reason for that <i>halakha</i> is <b>that perhaps</b> the woman <b>bent over</b> and leaned forward, <b>and</b> the blood <b>came from the room,</b> i.e., the uterus. If so, in the case where the blood was found <b>from the vestibule inward,</b> concerning which you ruled that she is definitely impure, you can <b>also say</b> that it is possible that the woman <b>staggered</b> backward <b>and</b> as a result the blood <b>came from</b> the <b>upper story</b> to the back of the canal. Accordingly, she should be impure merely out of uncertainty.
<b>Rather, Abaye says: If you follow the concern,</b> i.e., if your ruling of <i>halakha</i> is based on a concern that the blood might have moved due to the woman leaning forward or backward, then in both <b>this</b> case <b>and that,</b> whether the blood is found in the inner or outer section of the canal, the source of the blood <b>is uncertain. And if you follow</b> the <b>presumption</b> based on where the blood found in a particular place is usually from, then blood found <b>from the vestibule inward is definitely impure,</b> whereas blood found <b>from the vestibule outward is definitely pure.</b>
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches: Blood that is found in the corridor</b> is considered definite menstrual blood, and therefore if she engages in intercourse, both she and her partner would be <b>liable as a result of</b> this blood to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for entering the Temple</b> intentionally when ritually impure, or to bring an offering for entering unwittingly. <b>And one burns <i>teruma</i> due to it,</b> if the woman touches such produce. <b>And Rav Ketina says:</b> It is impure merely as a matter of uncertainty; therefore, the woman <b>is not obligated, due to</b> that blood, to bring an offering <b>for entering the Temple</b> when ritually impure, <b>and one does not burn <i>teruma</i> on its account.</b>
The Gemara discusses the relationship between this dispute and the previous statements of <i>amora’im</i>. <b>According to this formulation,</b> i.e., option, <b>that Abaye stated: If you follow the concern</b> that the blood might have moved due to the woman leaning forward or backward, there is uncertainty whether the blood was found in the inner or outer section of the canal, this <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ketina,</b> who likewise deems blood found in the canal impure due to uncertainty. <b>And</b> this option suggested by Abaye <b>contradicts</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> who deems the blood definitely impure.
<b>According to that formulation that Abaye stated: If you follow</b> the <b>presumption</b> that blood found in the inner section is definitely impure, while blood found in the outer section is definitely pure, this <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> whose ruling that the blood is definitely impure is understood as referring to blood found in the inner section.

Daf 18a

<b>And</b> this option <b>contradicts</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ketina,</b> who deems the blood impure due to uncertainty.
<b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna,</b> who said that if the blood was found in the inner section it is definitely impure, as it is presumed to come from the uterus, and if the blood was found in the outer section it is impure due to uncertainty, one can say that Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rav Ketina <b>do not disagree,</b> as they were referring to different cases. <b>Here,</b> where Rabbi Ḥiyya deems the blood definitely impure, he is speaking of blood found <b>from the vestibule and inward,</b> whereas <b>there,</b> Rav Ketina deems it impure due to uncertainty when it is found <b>from the vestibule and outward.</b>
<b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rami bar Shmuel and Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, who say</b> that if the blood is found <b>from the vestibule and outward, its</b> state of <b>uncertainty</b> renders it <b>pure,</b> whereas if it is found in the area <b>from the vestibule and inward, its</b> state of <b>uncertainty</b> renders it <b>impure, with regard to what</b> case can the dispute between <b>these</b> Sages, Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rav Ketina, be <b>interpreted?</b> It must be referring to a situation where the blood was found <b>from the vestibule and inward,</b> as according to Rami bar Shmuel and Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, if the blood is found from the vestibule and outward it is pure.
If so, <b>shall we say</b> that Rami bar Shmuel and Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, <b>disagree</b> with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> who deems the blood definitely impure, whereas they maintain that it is impure merely due to uncertainty?
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult.</b> It is possible that Rami bar Shmuel and Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, agree with the opinion of Rabbi Ḥiyya, as they maintain that there is no dispute between Rav Ketina and Rabbi Ḥiyya. Once again the reason is that Rav Ketina and Rabbi Ḥiyya might be referring to two different cases: <b>Here,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya deems the blood definitely impure because he is speaking of a case <b>where it is found on the floor of</b> the <b>corridor,</b> in which case the blood is presumed to come from the uterus rather than the bladder. <b>And there,</b> Rav Ketina, who deems the blood impure due to uncertainty, is referring to blood <b>that is found on the roof of</b> the <b>corridor,</b> and therefore it is uncertain whether the blood came from the bladder or the uterus.
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: In three places</b> where there is uncertainty <b>the Sages followed the majority, and</b> based on that majority <b>they established</b> the <i>halakha</i> in these cases <b>as</b> though they involved <b>a certainty.</b> The three cases are as follows: The <b>source,</b> the <b>afterbirth [<i>shilya</i>],</b> and <b>a shaped</b> limb. The Gemara elaborates: The <b>source</b> is <b>that which we</b> just <b>said,</b> i.e., that blood found in the corridor from the vestibule and inward it is ritually impure, because the majority of blood found there is from the uterus.
The <b>afterbirth</b> is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (26a): If a woman miscarried and <b>the afterbirth</b> is <b>in the house, the house is ritually impure,</b> in the sense that everything under the roof becomes impure due to impurity imparted by a corpse. <b>And</b> the reason is <b>not that the afterbirth</b> itself has the status of <b>an offspring; rather,</b> it is <b>that there is no afterbirth without an offspring.</b> It is clear that the afterbirth contained an offspring, which disintegrated after the miscarriage. That offspring renders the contents of the house impure. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The <b>offspring was squashed before it emerged</b> with the afterbirth. Consequently, the house is not rendered impure, because the squashed fetus is nullified by the majority of blood that accompanied the miscarriage.
The third case of an uncertainty where the Sages followed the majority is that of <b>a shaped</b> limb, <b>as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a woman <b>who miscarries a shaped hand,</b> i.e., its fingers are discernible, <b>or a shaped foot, its mother is impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth,</b> as it certainly came from a full-fledged fetus, <b>and we are not concerned</b> that <b>perhaps it came from</b> a fetus with <b>a sealed,</b> i.e., deficient <b>body,</b> in which case the miscarriage does not have the status of childbirth with regard to ritual impurity. The reason is that most pregnant women give birth to a fully formed fetus, and therefore it is presumed that the hand or foot came from a whole fetus that was squashed during childbirth. Once again the Sages established the impurity as a certainty, based on a majority.
The Gemara asks: <b>And are there no more</b> cases of uncertainty in which the Sages determined the <i>halakha</i> according to the status of the majority, treating the case as though it involved a certainty? <b>But isn’t there</b> the case of <b>nine stores?</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>nine stores</b> in a city, <b>all of which sell</b> kosher <b>meat</b> from <b>slaughtered</b> animals, <b>and one</b> other store that <b>sells meat</b> from unslaughtered <b>animal carcasses, and</b> a person <b>bought</b> meat <b>from one of</b> the stores <b>and he does not know from which</b> store <b>he bought</b> the meat, in this case of <b>uncertainty,</b> the meat <b>is prohibited.</b> With regard to an item of uncertain status, if it separated from its fixed location it is presumed to have separated from the majority of items like it in that location, and has their halakhic status. But in the case of an item that remained in its fixed location, i.e., didn’t separate, it is viewed as an uncertainty that is equally balanced, and one does not follow the majority. This ruling is based on the principle: The halakhic status of uncertainty with regard to any item fixed in its place is that of an uncertainty that is equally balanced, and one does not follow the majority.In this case, when it comes to determining whether or not this meat comes from a kosher store, since the uncertainty stems from the act of buying the meat in the store, and the stores are fixed in their places, the two types of stores are regarded as though they were equal in number.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And in the</b> case of meat <b>found</b> in the street, outside the stores, <b>follow the majority</b> of stores. If most stores in the city sell kosher meat one can assume that the meat he found is kosher, based on the principle: Any item separated, i.e., not fixed in its place, is presumed to have been separated from the majority. Similar to the previous cases, this meat is treated as certainly kosher on the basis of a majority.
The Gemara answers: <b>We say</b> that this list of cases mentioned by Rabbi Yoḥanan is referring to matters of <b>ritual impurity,</b> whereas <b>we do not say</b> that the list includes cases that involve <b>prohibitions,</b> such as that of non-kosher meat.
The Gemara further asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> the case where there were <b>nine</b> dead <b>frogs,</b> which do not impart ritual impurity, <b>and one</b> carcass of a <b>creeping animal among them,</b> which does impart impurity, <b>and</b> someone <b>touched one of</b> these ten dead creatures, <b>and he does not know which of them he touched?</b> The <i>halakha</i> is as follows: If this occurred <b>in the private domain</b> the item’s <b>uncertain</b> impurity renders it <b>impure,</b> as it is derived from the Torah that in cases of uncertainty with regard to ritual impurity in the private domain, the item is deemed impure. If the contact occurred <b>in the public domain,</b> the item’s <b>uncertainty</b> leaves it <b>pure.</b>
The Gemara continues: <b>And in</b> a case where one of these creatures was separated from the rest and <b>was found</b> elsewhere, and the person touched it there, <b>follow the majority.</b> Since most of the animals do not impart ritual impurity, this individual remains pure. This is another case involving uncertain impurity where the Sages established the <i>halakha</i> as certain based on the majority.
The Gemara explains: <b>We say</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan’s list is referring to matters of <b>ritual impurity of a woman,</b> whereas <b>we do not say</b> that the list includes cases that involve <b>ritual impurity in general.</b>
The Gemara further asks: <b>But isn’t there that which Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> With regard to a pregnant woman who <b>passed across a river</b>

Daf 18b

<b>and she miscarried</b> her fetus into the river, but she does not know whether or not the fetus was fully formed, <b>she brings</b> the <b>offering</b> of a woman after childbirth, i.e., a burnt offering and a sin offering. <b>And</b> the sin offering, which is a bird, <b>is eaten</b> after the nape of its neck has been severed, in the manner of a regular bird sin offering. This is the <i>halakha</i> despite the uncertainty, i.e., this fetus might not have been fully formed, in which case the woman is not obligated to bring this offering, and a bird that is not an offering may not be eaten if its nape was severed.
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi explains the reasoning behind this ruling: One must <b>follow the majority of</b> pregnant <b>women, and most</b> pregnant <b>women give birth to full-fledged offspring.</b> If so, this is another case involving an uncertainty where the Sages established the <i>halakha</i> as a certainty based on the majority. Furthermore, this case involves the ritual impurity of a woman. Why then did Rabbi Yoḥanan list only three cases of this kind?
The Gemara answers: <b>We say</b> that only cases taught in <b>the Mishna</b> or a <i>baraita</i> are included in this list, whereas <b>we do not say</b> that those derived from an amoraic <b>halakhic statement,</b> e.g., the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, are included.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this explanation: <b>But when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Ḥanina raises an objection</b> against the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi from a <i>baraita</i> that deals with <b>an unsure woman,</b> i.e., one who does not know when she gave birth. Ravin added: <b>And I do not know what his objection</b> was from that <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara discusses Ravin’s statement: <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that Ravin meant that this <i>baraita</i> is <b>not a refutation</b> of the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>but</b> actually provides <b>support</b> for that opinion? If so, that would mean that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi’s opinion is effectively taught in a <i>baraita</i> as well, and therefore according to the above consideration Rabbi Yoḥanan should have included it in his list.
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not</b> necessarily the correct inference, as <b>perhaps</b> Ravin meant simply that the ruling of this <i>baraita</i> is <b>neither a refutation nor a support</b> for the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi.
§ When Rabbi Yoḥanan says that in three places where there is uncertainty the Sages followed the majority and established the <i>halakha</i> as though it involved a certainty, he is clearly indicating that some cases are excluded from this category. The Gemara asks: Rabbi Yoḥanan says this <b>to exclude what?</b>
<b>If we say</b> that he says this <b>to exclude</b> an uncertain case where on the one hand there is <b>a majority that</b> indicates the woman should be deemed ritually impure and on the other hand <b>there is a presumptive status along with it</b> that opposes that majority, <b>which</b> is why the uncertainty is not treated as a certainty, and therefore <b>one does not burn <i>teruma</i> due to</b> contact with that impurity, this cannot be the case. The reason is that Rabbi Yoḥanan already <b>said it</b> on <b>another occasion,</b> with regard to other cases of ritual impurity, that if the consideration of a majority indicates that an item should be impure while its presumptive status indicates that it should be pure, it is not considered definitely impure.
The Gemara cites the source for Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion in this regard. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 3:8): If a ritually impure <b>child is found alongside</b> ritually pure <b>started dough</b> that has not yet risen, <b>and</b> he has <b>risen dough in his hand</b> that may have been removed from the larger portion of started dough, <b>Rabbi Meir deems</b> the started dough <b>pure,</b> since there is no proof the child touched it, as he might have been given the piece by someone else. <b>And the Rabbis deem it impure,</b> as they assume that he touched the started dough. The child is presumed to be impure, <b>because it is the norm of a child to handle</b> items.
<b>And we say</b> with regard to this dispute: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir? He holds</b> that <b>a majority of children handle</b> items that are within reach, in this case the dough, <b>and a minority do not handle</b> items within reach, <b>and this dough retains a presumptive status of purity,</b> since its impurity has not been definitively determined. Therefore, one should <b>append</b> the fact that the <b>minority</b> of children do not handle items within reach <b>to the presumptive status</b> of purity of the dough, <b>and</b> the force of the <b>majority</b> of children who handle items within reach <b>is weakened.</b> Therefore, the dough is considered pure.
<b>And the Rabbis</b> contend that in a case where the majority is followed, <b>the minority is considered like it does not exist. And</b> consequently, there is a conflict between the determining factors of <b>the majority</b> of impure children who handle items within reach <b>and the presumptive status</b> of purity of the dough. Therefore, <b>the majority takes precedence.</b>
<b>And Reish Lakish says in the name of Rabbi Oshaya: This</b> <i>halakha</i> of a child <b>is</b> an example of <b>a presumption,</b> that children handle items within reach, <b>over which <i>teruma</i> is burned,</b> as the Rabbis hold that it is sufficiently certain that the dough has become impure to allow it to be burned. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This is not a presumption over which <i>teruma</i> is burned.</b> Rather, the dough is left aside, and can be neither eaten nor burned, due to the uncertainty whether it is impure. In this context, Rabbi Yoḥanan has already stated that when a majority is contradicted by a presumption, the status of uncertainty applies. Therefore, there was no need for him to specify the three cases he mentioned in order to exclude situations of this kind.
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement that there are only three cases in which uncertainty is treated as certainty is meant <b>to exclude</b> a specific situation involving <b>a majority, as</b> discussed by <b>Rabbi Yehuda. As we learned</b> in a mishna (21a): In the case of a woman <b>who miscarries</b> an amorphous <b>piece</b> of flesh, <b>if there is blood</b> that emerges <b>with it,</b> the woman <b>is ritually impure</b> with the impurity of a menstruating woman. <b>And if not, she is pure,</b> as she is neither a menstruating woman nor a woman after childbirth. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> In <b>both this</b> case, where blood emerged, <b>and that</b> case, where no blood emerged, the woman <b>is impure</b> with the impurity of a menstruating woman, as there was certainly undetected blood that emerged with the flesh.
<b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Rabbi Yehuda deemed</b> the woman <b>impure,</b> despite the fact that no blood emerged, <b>only in</b> the case of <b>a piece</b> of flesh that has the color <b>of</b> one of the <b>four types of</b> ritually impure <b>blood,</b> as stated in the mishna below (19a). <b>But</b> if it has the color <b>of other types of blood,</b> the woman is <b>pure. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If a woman miscarries a piece of flesh that has the color <b>of</b> one of the <b>four types of</b> ritually impure <b>blood, all,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis, <b>agree</b> that she <b>is impure. And</b> likewise, if the piece has the color <b>of other types of blood, all agree</b> that <b>she is pure.</b> The Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagree only</b> with regard to a case <b>where</b> the woman <b>miscarried</b> an amorphous piece of flesh,

Daf 19a

<b>and she</b> herself <b>does not know</b> exactly <b>what</b> the appearance of the piece of flesh that <b>she miscarried</b> was, e.g., if it was lost. In this case <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds: Follow the majority of</b> miscarriages of amorphous <b>pieces</b> of flesh, <b>and the majority of pieces</b> of flesh have the appearance <b>of</b> one of the <b>four types of</b> impure <b>blood. And the Rabbis hold: We do not say: Follow the majority of</b> miscarriages of amorphous <b>pieces</b> of flesh. Therefore, Rabbi Yoḥanan’s mention of three cases is meant to exclude this statement of Rabbi Yehuda, who rules that the woman is definitely impure based on a majority.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <b>five</b> distinct colors of <b>ritually impure blood in a woman: Red, and black, and like the bright</b> color of the <b>crocus [<i>karkom</i>]</b> flower, <b>and like water</b> that inundates red <b>earth, and like diluted</b> wine. <b>Beit Shammai say: Even</b> blood <b>like the water</b> in which <b>a fenugreek</b> plant is soaked, <b>and like the liquid</b> that drips from <b>roast meat,</b> are ritually impure, <b>and Beit Hillel deem</b> blood of those colors <b>ritually pure.</b> With regard to blood that is <b>green, Akavya ben Mahalalel deems</b> it <b>impure and the Rabbis deem</b> it <b>pure.</b>
<b>Rabbi Meir said:</b> Even <b>if</b> the green blood <b>does not transmit impurity due to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of a blood <b>stain</b> or the blood of a menstruating woman, it is blood in that <b>it renders</b> food susceptible to <b>ritual impurity due to</b> its status as one of the seven <b>liquids</b> that render food susceptible to impurity. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Neither</b> in <b>this</b> sense, as the blood of a menstruating woman according to Akavya ben Mahalalel, <b>nor</b> in <b>that</b> sense, as a liquid that renders food susceptible to impurity according to Rabbi Meir, is green blood considered blood.
The mishna asks: <b>What is</b> the <b>red</b> color that is impure? It is as red <b>as the blood</b> that flows from <b>a wound.</b> What is the <b>black</b> color that is impure? It is blood as black <b>as <i>ḥeret</i>.</b> If the black is <b>deeper than that,</b> the blood is <b>ritually impure;</b> if the black is <b>lighter than that,</b> the blood is <b>ritually pure. And</b> what is the color that is <b>like the bright</b> color of the <b>crocus</b> flower that is impure? It is <b>like the brightest</b> part <b>in</b> the flower, which is harvested to produce the orange-colored spice saffron.
<b>And</b> what is the color that is <b>like water</b> that inundates red <b>earth</b> that is impure? It is specifically earth <b>from the Beit Kerem Valley and</b> specifically when <b>one inundates</b> the earth with enough <b>water</b> until it pools on the surface. <b>And</b> what is the color that is <b>like diluted</b> wine that is impure? It is specifically when the dilution consists of <b>two parts water and one</b> part <b>wine,</b> and specifically when it is <b>from the wine of the Sharon</b> region in Eretz Yisrael.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The fact that the mishna discusses the colors of ritually impure blood in a woman indicates that there is blood that is not impure. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that there is pure blood in a woman? Perhaps any</b> type of <b>blood that emerges from</b> a woman <b>is impure?</b>
<b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says:</b> The <b>verse states</b> with regard to those who come before the court: <b>“If there arise a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood,</b> between plea and plea, and between leprous mark and leprous mark, even matters of controversy within your gates, then you shall arise, and get up unto the place that the Lord your God shall choose” (Deuteronomy 17:8). When the verse states: “Between blood and blood,” it means <b>between pure blood and impure blood,</b> which demonstrates that there must be types of pure blood that are emitted by a woman.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If that is so,</b> then does the other expression in the verse: <b>“Between leprous mark and leprous mark,” also</b> mean: <b>Between a pure leprous mark and an impure leprous mark? And if you would say</b> that <b>indeed,</b> this is what it means, <b>is there</b> a type of <b>pure leprous mark? And if you would say</b> that there is in fact a pure leprous mark, according to the verse: “Then the priest shall look; and behold, if the leprosy has covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce pure the one that has the leprous mark; <b>it is all turned white: He is pure”</b> (Leviticus 13:13), <b>that</b> mark is not classified as a leprous mark; rather, it <b>is called a paleness,</b> as a leprous mark is by definition impure.
<b>Rather,</b> the phrase “between leprous mark and leprous mark” must mean the following: <b>Between the leprous marks</b> that afflict <b>man</b> (see Leviticus 13:1–46) <b>and the leprous marks of houses</b> (see Leviticus 14:33–53) <b>and the leprous marks of garments</b> (see Leviticus 13:47–59), as different <i>halakhot</i> pertain to these categories of leprous marks, <b>and</b> yet <b>they are all ritually impure.</b> Therefore, <b>here too,</b> when the verse states: “Between blood and blood,” it means: <b>Between the blood of a menstruating woman and the blood of a discharge [<i>ziva</i>], and they are all ritually impure.</b> If so, this verse cannot be cited as proof that there is a type of blood emitted by a woman that is pure.
The Gemara questions this interpretation: This verse serves as the source for the areas of <i>halakha</i> for which a rebellious elder is liable to receive the death penalty for publicly ruling in contradiction to a decision of the Sanhedrin, as it states: “And the man who does presumptuously, in not listening to the priest that stands to minister there before the Lord your God, or to the judge, that man shall die; and you shall exterminate the evil from Israel” (Deuteronomy 17:12). With this in mind, the Gemara asks: <b>What is this</b> explanation? <b>Granted, there,</b> with regard to leprous marks, even if all the leprous marks are impure, <b>one can disagree</b> with the Sanhedrin <b>with regard to the leprous marks</b> that afflict <b>man, and</b> therefore the rebellious elder could potentially disagree with the court <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute of Rabbi Yehoshua and the Rabbis.</b>
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 4:11): <b>If</b> the <b>snow-white leprous mark [<i>baheret</i>],</b> which is one sign of leprosy, <b>preceded</b> the <b>white hair,</b> which is another sign, he is <b>ritually impure,</b> as stated in the Torah (see Leviticus 13:3). <b>And if</b> the <b>white hair preceded</b> the <b><i>baheret</i></b> he is <b>pure,</b> as this is not considered a sign of impurity. If there is <b>uncertainty</b> as to which came first, he is <b>impure. And Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> It is <b>dull [<i>keha</i>]. And Rabba says,</b> explaining the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua: In the case of uncertainty, the leprous mark is deemed as though it is of <b>a dull</b> shade, and therefore the person is <b>ritually pure.</b>
Likewise, <b>with regard to the leprous marks of houses</b> one can find a case where the rebellious elder might dispute the ruling of the Sanhedrin, such <b>as that dispute between Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, and the Rabbis. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 12:3): <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: A house is never</b> deemed <b>impure</b> with leprosy <b>unless</b> the leprous mark <b>will be seen</b> to be the size <b>of two split beans,</b> and it is found <b>on two stones on two walls in a corner</b> between two walls. <b>The length of</b> the mark <b>is</b> that of <b>two split beans, and its width is</b> that of one <b>split bean.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon?</b> The word <b>“wall” is written</b> in the verse, <b>and</b> the word <b>“walls” is written</b> in the same verse: “And he shall see the leprous mark…in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and their appearance is lower than the wall” (Leviticus 14:37). <b>Which is</b> one <b>wall that is like two walls? You must say: This is a corner</b> between two walls.
Similarly, <b>with regard to the leprous marks on garments,</b> it is possible that the rebellious elder disputed the ruling of the Sanhedrin <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute between Rabbi Yonatan ben Avtolemos and the Rabbis. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan ben Avtolemos says: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to</b> a case where there is <b>a spread</b> of leprosy <b>in garments</b> that culminates with the garment’s being completely covered with leprous marks, <b>that</b> the garment <b>is pure,</b> just as the <i>halakha</i> is with regard to a leprous mark that fully covers a person?
It is derived via a verbal analogy: <b>A bareness within [<i>karaḥat</i>] and a bareness without [<i>gabbaḥat</i>]</b> are <b>stated with regard to</b> leprosy of <b>garments:</b> “And the priest shall look, after that the mark is washed; and, behold, if the mark has not changed its color, and the mark has not spread, it is impure; you shall burn it in the fire; it is a fret, whether the bareness be within or without” (Leviticus 13:55); <b>and a bald head [<i>karaḥat</i>] and a bald forehead [<i>gabbaḥat</i>]</b> are <b>stated with regard to</b> leprosy of <b>a person:</b> “But if there is in the bald head, or the bald forehead, a reddish-white mark, it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head, or his bald forehead” (Leviticus 13:42).
<b>Just as there,</b> with regard to a person, if the leprosy <b>spread to his entire</b> body he is <b>pure,</b> as the verse states: “Then the priest shall look; and behold, if the leprosy has covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce pure the one who has the leprous mark; it is all turned white: He is pure” (Leviticus 13:13), <b>so too here,</b> with regard to garments, if the leprosy <b>spread to</b> the <b>entire</b> garment it is <b>pure.</b>
The Gemara concludes: <b>But here,</b> concerning the phrase “between blood and blood,” <b>if there is no</b> type of <b>pure blood</b> at all, <b>with regard to what</b> issue could the rebellious elder <b>disagree</b> with the Sanhedrin? It must be that this verse is alluding to the fact that there is a type of blood of a woman that is pure.
§ Once it has been established that there are types of blood that are pure and other types that are impure, the Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that those</b> types of blood that are not listed in the mishna are <b>pure, and these</b> ones that are mentioned in the mishna are <b>impure? Rabbi Abbahu said that the verse states:</b> “And the sun shone upon the water, <b>and the Moabites saw the water</b> some way off <b>as red as blood”</b> (II Kings 3:22), which indicates that blood is red. The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that blood is red?</b> If so, one can <b>say</b> that only blood that is <b>red</b> like the blood of a wound is ritually impure, <b>and no more</b> colors of blood are impure.
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> in response: <b>The verse states,</b> with regard to a menstruating woman: “And she shall be purified from the source of <b>her blood [<i>dameha</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 12:7). The plural form of the word blood, <i>dameha</i>, indicates at least two types of blood. And another verse states: “And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness, he has made naked her source, and she has uncovered the source of <b>her blood [<i>dameha</i>];</b> both of them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 20:18). The use of the plural form of blood once again indicates another two types, which means that <b>there are four</b> types of blood stated <b>here.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that there are <b>five</b> types of impure blood in a woman, whereas the verses indicate that there are only four? <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> The <b>black</b> blood mentioned in the mishna <b>is</b> actually <b>red, but</b> its color <b>has faded,</b> which is why it looks black. Therefore, although the mishna lists five kinds of blood, there are only four basic types.
<b>This</b> opinion, that black blood is actually red blood, <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>black</b> color of blood that is impure is blood as black <b>as <i>ḥeret</i>.</b> If the black is <b>deeper than that,</b> the blood is <b>ritually impure;</b> if the black is <b>lighter</b> than that, <b>even</b> if it is still as dark <b>as blue,</b> the blood is <b>ritually pure. And this black</b> blood <b>does not blacken from its outset,</b> when it is inside the body; <b>rather, it blackens</b> only <b>when it is removed</b> from the body. This is <b>comparable to the blood of a wound,</b> which is initially red, but <b>when it is removed</b> from the body <b>it blackens.</b>
§ The mishna states that <b>Beit Shammai say: Even</b> blood <b>like the water</b> in which <b>a fenugreek</b> plant is soaked, and like the liquid that drips from roast meat, are ritually impure. The Gemara asks: <b>But do Beit Shammai not accept</b> the exposition of Rabbi Abbahu that the two mentions of the plural form of blood: <b>“<i>Dameha</i>”</b> (Leviticus 12:7), and <b>“<i>Dameha</i>”</b> (Leviticus 20:18), indicate that <b>there are four</b> types of blood <b>here?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that Beit Shammai <b>do not accept</b> this opinion of Rabbi Abbahu, and they maintain that there are more than four types of blood in a woman. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that Beit Shammai <b>do accept</b> Rabbi Abbahu’s exposition, and the apparent contradiction can be resolved as follows: <b>Didn’t Rabbi Ḥanina say</b> with regard to the <b>black</b> blood mentioned in the mishna that it is not an additional type, as it <b>is</b> actually <b>red but</b> its color <b>has faded? So too,</b> with regard to the colors of blood mentioned by Beit Shammai, that of water in which a fenugreek plant is soaked, and that of the liquid that drips from roast meat, one can say that these are not additional types of blood. Rather, they too were initially red but their color <b>faded.</b>
§ The mishna states: <b>And Beit Hillel deem</b> blood of those colors, i.e., the color of water in which a fenugreek plant is soaked or of the liquid that drips from roast meat, <b>ritually pure.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t this</b> opinion of Beit Hillel identical to the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>?</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b>

Daf 19b

with regard to whether <b>to leave in abeyance,</b> i.e., to treat as uncertain, blood the color of water in which a fenugreek plant is soaked, or the color of the liquid that drips from roast meat. According to the first <i>tanna</i> of the mishna there are five types of blood that are definitely impure, whereas other types, such as those mentioned by Beit Shammai, are deemed impure due to uncertainty. By contrast, Beit Hillel maintain that blood of these colors is entirely pure.
§ The mishna states: Blood that is <b>green, Akavya ben Mahalalel deems</b> it <b>impure.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But does Akavya</b> ben Mahalalel <b>not accept</b> the exposition of Rabbi Abbahu that the two verses: <b>“<i>Dameha</i>”</b> (Leviticus 12:7), and: <b>“<i>Dameha</i>”</b> (Leviticus 20:18), indicate that <b>there are four</b> types of blood <b>here?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that Akavya ben Mahalalel <b>does not accept</b> this opinion of Rabbi Abbahu, as he maintains that there are more than four types of blood in a woman. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that Akavya ben Mahalalel <b>accepts</b> Rabbi Abbahu’s exposition, and the apparent contradiction can be resolved as follows: <b>Didn’t Rabbi Ḥanina say,</b> with regard to the <b>black</b> blood mentioned in the mishna, that it <b>is</b> actually <b>red but</b> its color <b>has faded? Here too,</b> with regard to the green mentioned by Akavya ben Mahalalel, one can say that it was initially red but its color <b>faded</b> and turned green.
§ The mishna states with regard to blood that is green: <b>And the Rabbis deem</b> it <b>pure.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t this</b> opinion of the Rabbis identical to the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to whether <b>to leave in abeyance</b> blood that is green. According to the first <i>tanna</i> of the mishna there are five types of blood that are definitely impure, whereas other types, such as green, are impure due to uncertainty. By contrast, the Rabbis maintain that green blood is entirely pure.
§ The mishna states that <b>Rabbi Meir said:</b> Even <b>if</b> the green blood <b>does not transmit impurity due to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of a blood <b>stain</b> or the blood of a menstruating woman, it is blood in that it renders food susceptible to ritual impurity due to its status as one of the seven liquids that render food susceptible.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Meir accepted the opinion of Akavya ben Mahalalel and deemed</b> green blood <b>impure</b> as blood of a menstruating woman. <b>And</b> as for his statement in the mishna, <b>this</b> is what Rabbi Meir <b>was saying to the Rabbis: Granted that</b> in a case <b>where</b> a woman <b>finds a green stain on</b> an article of <b>clothing you do not deem</b> her <b>ritually impure,</b> as its greenness is an indication that it did not come from her body. But in a case <b>where she</b> actually <b>sees green blood</b> come <b>from her body, she shall be impure.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty with this interpretation: <b>If so,</b> why did Rabbi Meir say: Even <b>if it does not transmit impurity due to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of a blood <b>stain, it renders</b> food susceptible to <b>ritual impurity due to</b> its status as <b>a liquid?</b> According to the above explanation, he <b>should have</b> said: If the woman <b>saw</b> the emission of this blood, she is impure <b>as</b> a menstruating woman.
<b>Rather, this</b> is what Rabbi Meir <b>was saying to</b> the Rabbis: <b>Granted</b> that in a case <b>where</b> the woman <b>sees green blood from the outset you do not deem</b> her <b>ritually impure,</b> but in a case <b>where she sees red blood and then sees green blood, she shall be impure.</b> This is <b>just as it is with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the fluids of a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>] and a woman who experiences a discharge of uterine blood after her menstrual period [<i>zava</i>].</b> All fluids emitted by a <i>zav</i> or <i>zava</i>, such as saliva and urine, are impure. Likewise, green blood that is emitted by this woman who has already emitted red blood should be impure.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how would <b>the Rabbis</b> respond to this? The Gemara answers: They maintain that the impure fluids of a menstruating woman are only those that are <b>similar to saliva: Just as</b> when <b>saliva</b> leaves one’s mouth it <b>is</b> first <b>gathered</b> together <b>and</b> then <b>expelled</b> from the body, <b>so too, all</b> impure fluids are those that are <b>gathered</b> together <b>and</b> then <b>expelled.</b> This definition serves <b>to exclude this</b> green blood, <b>which is not gathered</b> together <b>and expelled.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so, the Rabbis spoke well to Rabbi Meir,</b> i.e., their answer is convincing. Why does Rabbi Meir deem green blood impure?
<b>Rather, this</b> is what Rabbi Meir <b>was saying to</b> the Rabbis: <b>Let</b> green blood <b>be</b> at least <b>like</b> one of the seven <b>liquids that render seeds</b> upon which they fall <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity. Why is green blood deemed pure even with regard to this matter? <b>And the Rabbis</b> disagree because they <b>require</b> that every type of blood that renders food susceptible to ritual impurity be like that mentioned in the verse: “And drink <b>the blood of the slain”</b> (Numbers 23:24), i.e., the blood that flows at the time of death; <b>and</b> green blood is <b>not</b> the type that flows at the time of death. Therefore, it does not render food susceptible to ritual impurity. The Gemara again asks: <b>If so, the Rabbis spoke well to Rabbi Meir.</b> Why does he disagree with them?
<b>Rather, this</b> is what Rabbi Meir <b>was saying to</b> the Rabbis: <b>Learn</b> this <i>halakha</i> that green blood renders food susceptible to ritual impurity <b>from</b> the following <b>verbal analogy: It is written here,</b> in a description of the beloved woman that alludes to her menstrual blood: <b>“Your shoots [<i>shelaḥayikh</i>] are an orchard of pomegranates”</b> (Song of Songs 4:13), <b>and it is written there:</b> “Who gives rain upon the earth, <b>and sends [<i>veshole’aḥ</i>] waters upon the fields”</b> (Job 5:10). This verbal analogy indicates that menstrual blood is similar to water in that both render food susceptible to ritual impurity.
<b>And the Rabbis</b> disagree with Rabbi Meir, as they do not have a tradition that this is an accepted verbal analogy, and there is a principle that although <b>a person may derive an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>on his own,</b> i.e., even though he was not taught that particular logical argument by his teachers, <b>a person may not derive a verbal analogy on his own,</b> but only if he received it by tradition.
§ The mishna states that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Neither</b> in <b>this</b> sense, as the blood of a menstruating woman according to Akavya ben Mahalalel, nor in that sense, as a liquid that renders food susceptible according to Rabbi Meir, is green blood considered blood. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Isn’t this</b> the same as the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is teaching us: Who is the first <i>tanna</i>? Rabbi Yosei. And</b> the reason Rabbi Yosei’s name is mentioned is due to the principle that <b>anyone who reports a statement in the name of the one who said it brings redemption to the world.</b>
§ The mishna states: <b>What is</b> the <b>red</b> color of blood that is impure? It is as red <b>as the blood</b> that flows from <b>a wound.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>As the blood</b> that flows from <b>a wound? Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Like the blood of a slaughtered ox.</b>
The Gemara inquires: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>say</b> explicitly that it is as red <b>as the blood of slaughter.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>If</b> the <i>tanna</i> had <b>said</b> that it is as red <b>as the blood of slaughter, I would say</b> that it means as red <b>as</b> the blood that flows throughout <b>the entire slaughter,</b> and it would apply to the shades of all blood emitted during the process. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that it is as red <b>as the blood</b> that flows from <b>a wound,</b> i.e., <b>as</b> the blood that flows at <b>the beginning of the slitting with</b> the slaughtering <b>knife.</b>
The Gemara cites other definitions of the color described in the mishna as: Red as the blood that flows from a wound. <b>Ulla says:</b> It is red <b>like the blood</b> that flows from <b>a living bird</b> that was wounded. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: When Ulla specified that the bird is <b>living,</b> did he mean that it was not dead, <b>to exclude</b> the blood of <b>a slaughtered</b> bird? <b>Or perhaps</b> he meant that the bird was healthy, <b>to exclude</b> the blood of <b>a weak</b> bird. No answer was found, and therefore the Gemara concludes that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
The Gemara cites another definition: <b>Ze’eiri</b> says that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> It is red <b>like the blood</b> that comes from a squashed <b>head louse.</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a mishna that discusses a stain found on a woman’s garment (58b): If a woman <b>killed a louse</b> and subsequently found a blood stain on her garment or body, <b>this</b> woman <b>may attribute</b> the stain <b>to</b> that louse, and she remains pure. The Gemara explains the objection: <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that this is referring to a louse <b>from all</b> parts of <b>her body,</b> not just the head, as claimed by Rabbi Ḥanina? If so, the color of impure blood is like the color of the blood of a louse from anywhere on the body. The Gemara answers: <b>No;</b> this <i>halakha</i> is referring specifically to a louse that was <b>on her head.</b>
The Gemara cites yet another definition of the color described in the mishna as: Red as the blood that flows from a wound. The Sage <b>Ami of Vardina</b> says that <b>Rabbi Abbahu says:</b> It is red <b>as</b> the <b>blood</b> that flows from the <b>smallest finger of</b> the <b>hand, which was wounded and</b> later <b>healed and was</b> subsequently <b>wounded again. And</b> this is <b>not</b> referring to the finger <b>of any person, but</b> specifically to the finger <b>of a young man who has not</b> yet <b>married a woman. And</b> furthermore, this does not mean any young man; rather, <b>until what</b> age must he be? <b>Until twenty</b> years <b>old.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the aforementioned mishna (58b): If the woman’s husband or son suffered an injury, <b>she may attribute</b> a blood stain she finds on her garment <b>to her son or to her husband,</b> and she remains pure. The Gemara analyzes this <i>halakha</i>: <b>Granted, with regard to</b> the ruling that she may attribute it to <b>her son, you can find</b> a case where this meets all the requirements specified by Rabbi Abbahu, i.e., he could be younger than twenty and unmarried. <b>But</b> with regard to the ruling that she may attribute it to <b>her husband, how can you find</b> a case where her husband is unmarried?
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says:</b> It is possible in a case <b>where</b> this woman <b>entered the</b> marriage <b>canopy but has not</b> yet <b>engaged in intercourse</b> with her husband. In such a situation, although he is her husband he is physically akin to an unmarried young man. Therefore, she can attribute the blood stain to his wound.
<b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> This red is <b>like the blood</b> spilled in the process <b>of bloodletting.</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>An incident</b> occurred involving a blood stain found on a woman’s garment, <b>and Rabbi Meir attributed</b>

Daf 20a

it <b>to an eye salve [<i>bekilor</i>],</b> which the woman had previously handled. <b>And</b> likewise, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>attributed</b> a stain <b>to the sap of a sycamore</b> tree the woman had touched. The Gemara explains the objection: <b>What, is it not</b> the case that Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi attributed red bloodstains <b>to</b> these causes because they are <b>red,</b> albeit not as red as blood? Evidently, the color of impure blood can be similar to such shades of red as well, which means that all these distinctions mentioned by the <i>amora’im</i> above are irrelevant.
The Gemara answers: <b>No;</b> Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi attributed stains <b>to</b> an eye salve and the sap of a sycamore tree because those stains were like the <b>other</b> types of <b>blood</b> mentioned in the mishna.
The Gemara relates that <b>Ameimar and Mar Zutra and Rav Ashi were sitting before a bloodletter,</b> to receive treatment. The bloodletter <b>removed</b> blood in a bloodletter’s <b>horn from Ameimar</b> for his <b>first</b> treatment. Ameimar <b>saw</b> the blood and <b>said to</b> his colleagues: The <b>red</b> color <b>that we learned</b> about in the mishna is <b>like this</b> blood in the horn. The bloodletter again <b>removed</b> blood from Ameimar, this time using <b>another</b> horn. Upon seeing the blood in this horn, Ameimar <b>said to them:</b> The color of this blood <b>has changed</b> compared to the blood in the first horn. <b>Rav Ashi,</b> who saw both types of blood, <b>said:</b> Any Sage <b>such as myself, as I do not know</b> how to distinguish <b>between this</b> blood <b>and that</b> blood, <b>should not see,</b> i.e., examine, different types of <b>blood</b> to issue a ruling as to whether they are pure or impure.
§ The mishna teaches: What is the <b>black</b> color that is impure? It is blood as black <b>as <i>ḥeret</i>. Rabba bar Rav Huna says:</b> This <b><i>ḥeret</i> of which</b> the Sages <b>spoke</b> is <b>ink.</b> The Gemara notes that <b>this</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: This <b>black</b> color is <b>like <i>ḥeret</i>, and</b> the <b>black of which</b> the Sages <b>spoke</b> is <b>ink.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, why does the <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i> mention both terms? <b>Let him say</b> simply: <b>Ink.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>If</b> the <i>tanna</i> had <b>said</b> only: <b>Ink, I would say</b> that he means that it is <b>like the clear part of the ink,</b> i.e., the upper portion of ink in an inkwell, which is very bright. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that it is <b>like the blackness [<i>ḥaruta</i>] of the ink,</b> the lower part of the inkwell, which is darker.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: To which type of <i>ḥeret</i> were the Sages referring? Were they referring <b>to moist or dry</b> <i>ḥeret</i>? <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from a practical ruling, <b>as</b> when black blood was brought before <b>Rabbi Ami</b> he would <b>break up pieces of</b> dried <b>ink and examine</b> blood <b>with it.</b>
§ The mishna states that if the blackness of the blood is deeper than ink, it is impure, whereas if it is lighter it is pure. In this regard, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If a woman saw blood whose color was <b>like</b> black <b>wax [<i>kekir</i>]</b> or <b>like</b> black <b>ink or like</b> a black <b>grape, she is ritually impure. And this is</b> the meaning of <b>that which we learned</b> in the mishna: If the black is <b>deeper than that,</b> it is <b>ritually impure. Rabbi Elazar says:</b> If a woman saw blood whose color was <b>like</b> a black <b>olive,</b> or <b>like</b> black <b>tar, or like</b> a black <b>raven,</b> this blood is <b>pure. And this is</b> the meaning of that <b>which we learned</b> in the mishna: If the black is <b>lighter than that,</b> it is <b>ritually pure.</b>
<b>Ulla says:</b> When the mishna states that black blood is impure, it means <b>like</b> the garments of the inhabitants of <b>Siva’a,</b> which were extremely black. The Gemara relates that when <b>Ulla happened</b> to go <b>to Pumbedita, he saw a certain Arab [<i>tayya’a</i>] who was dressed in a black garment.</b> Ulla <b>said to</b> the Sages of Pumbedita: The <b>black</b> color <b>that we learned</b> about in the mishna is <b>like this</b> color. Since people wanted a sample of the shade of blood mentioned in the mishna, <b>they tore</b> the Arab’s garment <b>from him bit by bit,</b> and in recompense <b>they gave him four hundred dinars.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The black blood that the mishna says is impure is like <b>these cloths of the bath attendants [<i>haolyarin</i>] who come from overseas.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that these are black</b> cloths? <b>But didn’t Rabbi Yannai say to his sons: My sons, do not bury me in black cloths nor in white cloths.</b> Not in <b>black, lest I be acquitted</b> in judgment <b>and I will be</b> among the righteous <b>like a mourner among the grooms.</b> And not in <b>white, lest I not be acquitted</b> in judgment <b>and I will be</b> among the wicked <b>like a groom among the mourners. Rather,</b> bury me <b>in the cloths of the bath attendants who come from overseas,</b> which are neither black nor white. <b>Apparently,</b> these cloths of the bath attendants <b>are not black.</b>
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as a distinction can be made. When Rabbi Yannai indicates that they are not black, <b>that</b> is referring <b>to</b> a regular <b>garment,</b> whereas with regard to the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan that indicates that they are black, <b>that</b> is referring <b>to</b> a cloth placed on an item such as <b>a table</b> or a bed.
§ With regard to the examination of the five types of blood mentioned in the mishna, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: And</b> with regard to <b>all of them,</b> in their various shades, <b>one examines them only</b> when they are placed <b>on a white</b> linen <b>cloth,</b> as only in this fashion can one properly discern the precise color of the blood. <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi says: And</b> in the case of <b>black</b> blood, one must place it <b>on a red</b> linen cloth.
<b>Rav Yirmeya of Difti says: And</b> Shmuel and Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi <b>do not disagree,</b> as <b>this</b> statement of Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi is referring specifically <b>to black</b> blood, whereas <b>that</b> ruling of Shmuel that one must use a white cloth is referring <b>to</b> the <b>other</b> four types of <b>blood</b> listed in the mishna. <b>Rav Ashi objects to this</b> interpretation: <b>If so, let Shmuel say:</b> With regard to all of them <b>except for black,</b> one examines them only when they are placed on a white linen cloth. <b>Rather, Rav Ashi says:</b> Shmuel and Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi <b>disagree with regard to black</b> blood <b>itself,</b> whether it should be examined against the background of a white or a red cloth.
<b>Ulla says:</b> With regard to <b>all of</b> these five types of blood enumerated in the mishna, if the color is <b>deeper than</b> that which is described in the mishna the blood is <b>ritually impure;</b> if it is <b>lighter than it,</b> the blood is <b>ritually pure, as</b> explicitly stated in the mishna with regard to <b>black.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>what is different</b> about <b>black, that</b> the mishna <b>mentions</b> this <i>halakha</i> only with regard to that color? The Gemara answers: The reason is that it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> The <b>black</b> blood mentioned in the mishna <b>is</b> actually <b>red but</b> its color <b>has faded, therefore, even</b> if it is <b>lighter than</b> that which is described in the mishna, <b>it should also be impure.</b> Consequently, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that even with regard to black blood, if the color is lighter than the shade mentioned in the mishna, it is pure.
<b>Rabbi Ami bar Abba says: And</b> with regard to <b>all of</b> these five types of blood, if the color is <b>deeper than</b> that which is described in the mishna, the blood is <b>ritually impure;</b> if it is <b>lighter than</b> that which is described in the mishna, it is also <b>ritually impure, except for black,</b> which is pure if it is lighter. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if these types of blood, except for black, are impure whether they are deeper or lighter than the specific shade described in the mishna, <b>what purpose do the measures</b> specified <b>by the Sages</b> in the mishna <b>serve?</b> The Gemara answers that these descriptions are <b>to the exclusion of</b> a color that is <b>lighter than lighter,</b> i.e., the color is so faint that it does not qualify as impure blood.
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of the above statement. <b>Rami bar Abba says: And</b> with regard to <b>all of</b> these five types of blood, if the color is <b>deeper than that</b> which is described in the mishna, it is <b>ritually pure;</b> if it is <b>lighter than that,</b> it is also <b>ritually pure, except for black,</b> which is impure if it is deeper. <b>And for this</b> reason <b>the measures,</b> i.e., descriptions, <b>of the Sages are effective,</b> as any discrepancy from these descriptions means that the blood is pure.
<b>Bar Kappara says: And</b> with regard to <b>all of them,</b> if the color is <b>deeper than that,</b> the blood is <b>impure;</b> if it is <b>lighter than that,</b> it is <b>pure, except</b> for blood the color of <b>diluted</b> wine, with regard to <b>which</b> if the color is <b>deeper than that,</b> the blood is <b>pure,</b> and if it is <b>lighter than that,</b> it is also <b>pure.</b> The Gemara relates that in an effort to test <b>bar Kappara,</b> the Sages brought before him blood that had the appearance of diluted wine and <b>they lightened it, and</b> bar Kappara <b>deemed it pure.</b> On another occasion <b>they deepened</b> the color of blood that looked like diluted wine, <b>and</b> again bar Kappara <b>deemed it pure. Rabbi Ḥanina says</b> in astonishment: <b>How great</b> is this <b>man whose heart,</b> which is so sensitive it can distinguish between such similar shades of blood, <b>is in accordance with his</b> ruling of <b><i>halakha</i>.</b>
§ The mishna teaches, with regard to the colors of impure blood: <b>And</b> what is the color that is <b>like the bright</b> color of the <b>crocus</b> flower that is impure? It is like the brightest part of the flower, which is used to produce the orange-colored spice saffron. The Sages <b>taught:</b> This is referring to the appearance of <b>moist</b> saffron that is still fresh <b>and not</b> to its <b>dry</b> counterpart.
With regard to this color, it <b>is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> that it is <b>like</b> the <b>lower</b> part of the crocus flower, <b>not like</b> its <b>upper</b> part; <b>and</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that it is <b>like</b> the <b>upper</b> part of the flower <b>and not like</b> its <b>lower</b> part; <b>and</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that it is <b>like</b> its <b>upper</b> part, <b>and all the more so</b> blood whose color is <b>like</b> its <b>lower</b> part is impure; <b>and</b> it <b>is taught</b> in yet <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that it is <b>like</b> its <b>lower</b> part, <b>and all the more so</b> blood whose color is <b>like</b> its <b>upper</b> part is impure.
<b>Abaye says</b> that these <i>baraitot</i> do not contradict one another, as the crocus has <b>three layers</b> of the brightly colored parts of the crocus flower harvested for saffron, one above the other, <b>and</b> in each layer <b>there are three leaves,</b> i.e., styles or stigmata.
In order to examine blood whose color is similar to saffron, you should <b>grasp</b> the <b>middle leaf</b> of the <b>middle layer in your hand</b> and compare it to the blood. If they are similar, the blood is impure. Consequently, the four <i>baraitot</i> do not contradict one another: The first two <i>baraitot</i> are referring to the layer of leaves that must be examined. The first <i>baraita</i> says that it is the lower one, as the middle layer is lower than the upper one, while the second <i>baraita</i> states the reverse because the middle layer is higher than the lower one. Meanwhile, the last two <i>baraitot</i> are dealing with the leaves within the middle layer. The <i>baraita</i> that states: Like its lower part, and all the more so like its upper part, means: Like the lowest of the three leaves and all the more so like the middle leaf, which is above that leaf, while the other <i>baraita</i> states a similar idea with regard to the upper and middle leaves. In any event, all four <i>baraitot</i> are referring to the part of the crocus flower that is called by the mishna its brightest part.
The Gemara relates: <b>When</b> people <b>would come before Rabbi Abbahu</b> for him to examine blood whose color was similar to saffron, <b>he</b> would <b>say to them: We learned</b> that the mishna is referring specifically to crocus flowers that are still <b>in their clumps</b> of earth in which they grew, as once they are detached from that earth their color changes.
§ The mishna states: <b>And</b> what is the color that is <b>like water</b> that inundates red <b>earth</b> that is impure? In this regard <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In order to examine blood that is <b>like water</b> that inundates red <b>earth, one brings fertile earth from the Beit Kerem Valley and one inundates</b> the earth with enough <b>water</b> until it pools on the surface; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> One brings earth <b>from the Yodfat Valley. Rabbi Yosei says: From the Sikhnei Valley. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> One can <b>even</b> bring earth <b>from the Genosar Valley or</b> from <b>similar</b> places.
It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> to test whether blood is <b>like water</b> that inundates red <b>earth, one brings fertile earth from the Beit Kerem Valley and one inundates</b> the earth with an amount of <b>water</b> that rises above the earth by the thickness <b>of the husk of garlic. And there is no</b> required <b>measure for the water, because there is no</b> required <b>measure for</b> the <b>earth</b> with which the examination must be performed; it is sufficient to use a small amount of earth with a small amount of water. <b>And one does not examine it</b> when the water is <b>clear,</b> as it does not have the color of the earth, but <b>rather</b> when it is <b>muddy</b> from the earth. And if the water <b>became clear</b> because the earth settled, <b>one must muddy it again. And when one muddies it he does not muddy it by hand</b> but <b>rather with a vessel.</b>
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Does the statement that <b>one does not muddy it by hand</b> but <b>rather with a vessel</b> mean <b>that one should not put</b> the dirt <b>into his hand and muddy</b> the water with dirt in his hand, <b>but</b> in a case where the earth is <b>in a vessel, when one muddies it</b> by mixing the earth and water <b>with his hand</b> one may <b>well</b> do so? <b>Or perhaps</b> the <i>baraita</i> means <b>that</b> even when the earth is in a vessel <b>one should not muddy</b> the water by mixing it with earth <b>with his hand,</b> but <b>rather with a vessel?</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When one examines</b> this water, <b>he examines it only with a cup.</b> Evidently, it is necessary to use a vessel. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>But you still have a dilemma.</b> This <i>baraita</i> merely states that the <b>examination</b> must be performed while the water is <b>in a cup,</b> but <b>with what</b> is the <b>muddying</b> performed? Must this be done by means of a vessel alone, or may one use his hand as well? The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The Gemara relates: <b>When</b> people would <b>come before Rabba bar Avuh</b> to examine blood that is similar to water that inundates red earth, <b>he</b> would <b>say to them: We learned</b> that the examination must be conducted <b>in its place,</b> i.e., the location the earth was taken from. But if the earth was transported elsewhere, the examination is no longer effective. The Gemara further relates that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina</b> would <b>break up a clump of earth and examine with it,</b> without mixing it in water. <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei,</b> would <b>curse</b> anyone who used this method that they should be punished <b>with diphtheria.</b>

Daf 20b

Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, explained: <b>It is</b> only <b>Rabbi Ḥanina</b> who is permitted to examine the blood in this fashion, <b>as he is wise,</b> but <b>everyone</b> else <b>is not so wise</b> that they can successfully perform the examination without water.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Ḥanina’s wisdom causes me not to see blood</b> for a halakhic examination. When <b>I would</b> examine blood and <b>deem</b> it <b>impure, he would deem</b> it <b>pure,</b> and when <b>I would deem</b> it <b>pure, he would deem</b> it <b>impure.</b> Conversely, <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Rabbi Ḥanina’s humility causes me to see blood,</b> as I reason to myself: <b>If Rabbi Ḥanina, who is humble, places himself into</b> a situation of <b>uncertainty and sees</b> various types of blood to determine their status, should <b>I,</b> who am not nearly as humble, <b>not see</b> blood for an examination?
<b>Rabbi Zeira says: The</b> complex <b>nature</b> of the residents <b>of Babylonia causes me not to see blood</b> for a halakhic examination, <b>as I say</b> to myself: Even matters <b>involving the</b> complex <b>nature</b> of people <b>I do not know;</b> can I then claim that <b>I know</b> about matters <b>of blood?</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> the <b>matter</b> of the appearance of blood <b>is dependent on the nature</b> of people, i.e., that it changes in accordance with their nature? <b>But Rabba is</b> an example of someone <b>who knew about the</b> complex <b>nature</b> of the people of Babylonia, <b>and</b> yet <b>he did not know</b> how to distinguish between different types <b>of blood.</b> The Gemara answers: Rabbi Zeira took this factor into account and <b>said</b> to himself: <b>All the more so; if Rabba, who knew about the</b> complex <b>nature</b> of these people, nevertheless <b>would not see blood,</b> should <b>I,</b> who am unknowledgeable about the nature of these people, <b>see</b> blood for examination?
The Gemara relates that <b>Ulla happened</b> to come <b>to Pumbedita,</b> where <b>they brought blood before him</b> for an examination, <b>but he would not see</b> it, as <b>he said: If Rabbi Elazar, who was the master of Eretz Yisrael</b> in wisdom, <b>when he would happen</b> to come <b>to the locale of Rabbi Yehuda, he would not see blood, shall I see blood</b> here?
The Gemara asks: <b>And why would they call</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>the master of Eretz Yisrael</b> in wisdom? The Gemara explains that there was an incident <b>involving a certain woman who brought blood before Rabbi Elazar</b> for examination, and <b>Rabbi Ami was sitting before him.</b> Rabbi Ami observed that Rabbi Elazar <b>smelled</b> the blood and <b>said to</b> the woman: <b>This is blood of desire,</b> i.e., your desire for your husband caused you to emit this blood, and it is not the blood of menstruation. <b>After</b> the woman <b>left</b> Rabbi Elazar’s presence, <b>Rabbi Ami caught up with her</b> and inquired into the circumstances of her case. <b>She said to him: My husband was</b> absent <b>on a journey, and I desired him.</b> Rabbi Ami <b>read</b> the following verse <b>about</b> Rabbi Elazar: <b>“The counsel of the Lord is with those who fear Him;</b> and His covenant, to make them know it” (Psalms 25:14), i.e., God reveals secret matters to those who fear Him.
The Gemara further relates that <b>Ifera Hurmiz, the mother of King Shapur, sent blood before Rava</b> for examination, as she sought to convert and was practicing the <i>halakhot</i> of menstruation. At that time <b>Rav Ovadya was sitting before</b> Rava. Rav Ovadya observed that Rava <b>smelled</b> the blood and later <b>said to</b> the woman: <b>This is blood of desire. She said to her son: Come</b> and <b>see how wise the Jews</b> are, as Rava is correct. Her son <b>said to her: Perhaps</b> Rava was <b>like a blind man</b> who escapes <b>from a chimney,</b> i.e., it was a lucky guess.
Ifera Hurmiz <b>then sent</b> Rava <b>sixty</b> different types of <b>blood,</b> some impure and others pure, <b>and</b> with regard to <b>all of them</b> Rava accurately <b>told her</b> their origin. The Gemara adds: <b>That last</b> sample of blood sent by Ifera Hurmiz <b>was blood of lice, and</b> Rava <b>did not know</b> what it was. He received <b>support</b> in this <b>matter</b> in the form of heavenly guidance, as he unwittingly <b>sent her</b> as a gift <b>a comb for killing lice. She said</b> in exclamation: <b>Jews, you</b> must <b>dwell in the chamber of</b> people’s <b>hearts.</b>
§ The Gemara cites more statements of the Sages with regard to the examination of blood. <b>Rav Yehuda says: At first I would see blood,</b> i.e., perform examinations of blood, but I changed my conduct <b>when the mother of my son Yitzḥak,</b> i.e., my wife, <b>said to me</b> that she acts as follows: With regard to <b>this first drop</b> of blood that I see, <b>I do not bring it before the Sages, because it is not pristine</b> blood, i.e., other substances are mixed with it. After hearing this, I decided <b>I</b> would <b>no</b> longer <b>see</b> blood, as it is possible that the first drop, which I do not get to see, was impure.
Rav Yehuda continues: But with regard to the examination of blood that a woman who gave birth emitted after the completion of her days of purity, i.e., at least forty days after giving birth to a male, or eighty after giving birth to a female (see Leviticus, chapter 12), in order to determine <b>whether she is ritually impure or pure, I certainly see</b> this blood and determine her status based on its color. This blood is clean, as the woman has been bleeding for a long period of time.
§ The Gemara relates that <b>Yalta,</b> Rav Naḥman’s wife, <b>brought blood before Rabba bar bar Ḥana, and he deemed her ritually impure. She then brought</b> it <b>before Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, and he deemed her pure.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But how could</b> Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, <b>act in this manner? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a halakhic authority who deemed</b> an item <b>impure, another</b> halakhic authority <b>is not allowed to deem</b> it <b>pure;</b> if one halakhic authority <b>deemed</b> a matter <b>prohibited, another</b> halakhic authority <b>is not allowed to deem</b> it <b>permitted?</b>
The Gemara explains that <b>initially</b> Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, <b>deemed her impure,</b> but he changed his mind <b>when</b> Yalta <b>said to him: Every day</b> that I bring blood <b>of this kind</b> of color to Rabba bar bar Ḥana <b>he deems me pure, and specifically now</b> he issued a different ruling, <b>as he feels</b> pain <b>in his eye.</b> Upon hearing this, Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, <b>deemed her pure.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> are people <b>deemed credible</b> to present claims such as the one presented by Yalta? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes; and</b> likewise <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A woman is deemed credible</b> if she <b>says: I saw</b> blood <b>like this</b> color, <b>but I lost it</b> before it could be examined.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If a woman states to her friend who showed her blood: My blood, which has an appearance <b>like this, so-and-so, the halakhic authority, deemed</b> it <b>pure, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is she deemed credible concerning its status?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma from the <i>baraita</i> cited above: <b>A woman is deemed credible</b> if she <b>says: I saw</b> blood <b>like this</b> color, <b>but I lost it.</b> This demonstrates that a woman may issue claims of this kind. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>There</b> it <b>is different, as</b> in that case the blood <b>is not before her,</b> and therefore the Sages were lenient. But here, the woman’s friend can take her blood to a halakhic authority for examination.
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the incident cited above, <b>as Yalta brought blood before Rabba bar bar Ḥana, and he deemed her ritually impure;</b> she then brought it <b>before Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, and he deemed her pure. And</b> the Gemara asked: <b>How could</b> Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, <b>act in this manner? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a halakhic authority who deemed</b> an item <b>impure, another</b> halakhic authority <b>is not allowed to deem</b> it <b>pure?</b>
<b>And we say</b> in response that initially Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, <b>deemed her impure,</b> but he changed his mind <b>when she said to him that every day</b> that she brings blood <b>of this kind</b> of color to Rabba bar bar Ḥana <b>he deems her pure, and specifically now</b> he issued a different ruling, <b>as he feels</b> pain <b>in his eye.</b> The Gemara summarizes: The conclusion of the story was that upon hearing this, Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, <b>then deemed her pure. Evidently,</b> when a woman issues claims with regard to blood that is presented, <b>we deem her</b> claims <b>credible.</b>
The Gemara answers: That incident does not provide proof, as <b>Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, relied on his studies</b> in his lenient ruling. At first, he was reluctant to issue his ruling, in deference to Rabba bar bar Ḥana, who had said the blood was impure. But when he heard Yalta’s explanation he deemed the blood pure, as he had originally thought. Therefore, there is no proof from there that a woman’s statements of this kind are accepted.
§ The Gemara further relates: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi once <b>saw</b> a woman’s <b>blood at night and deemed</b> it <b>impure. He</b> again <b>saw</b> that blood <b>in the day,</b> after it had dried, <b>and deemed</b> it <b>pure.</b> He <b>waited one hour</b> and then <b>deemed</b> it <b>impure again.</b> It is assumed that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi did not conduct another examination at this point; rather, he reasoned that the previous night’s examination had been correct, and the blood’s color should be deemed impure because of how it had looked when it was moist. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi then <b>said: Woe is me! Perhaps I erred</b> by declaring the blood impure, as based on its color it should be pure.
The Gemara questions this statement: <b>Perhaps I erred? He certainly erred, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>a halakhic authority may not say: If</b> the blood <b>were moist it would certainly have been impure,</b> and yet here, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi deemed the blood impure based on that type of reasoning.
The Gemara explains that the incident did not unfold as initially assumed. <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi examined the blood three times, as he <b>said: A judge has only what his eyes see</b> as the basis for his ruling. <b>Initially,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>established the presumptive status</b> of the blood <b>as ritually impure,</b> but <b>when he saw in the morning that</b> its color had <b>changed, he said: It was definitely pure</b> last night as well, <b>and only</b> because it was <b>at night</b> I thought that it was impure, <b>because it could not be seen well.</b> Subsequently, <b>when he saw</b> after a short while <b>that</b> its color <b>again changed,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: This</b> blood <b>is impure, and it is gradually becoming lighter</b> as its color fades.
With regard to the manner in which the Sages would examine blood, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>would examine</b> blood <b>by candlelight. Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosef, would examine</b> blood <b>between the pillars</b> of the study hall even <b>on a cloudy day,</b> despite the fact that it was not very light there. <b>Rav Ami bar Shmuel says: And</b> in <b>all these</b> cases, <b>one examines</b> blood <b>only between sunlight and shade. Rav Naḥman</b> says that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> One stands <b>in</b> a place lit by the <b>sun, and</b> he conducts the examination <b>under the shadow of his hand,</b> i.e., he places his hand over the blood. In this manner the color of the blood can be best discerned.
§ The mishna states: <b>And</b> what is the color that is <b>like diluted</b> wine that is impure? It is specifically when the dilution consists of <b>two parts</b> water and one part wine, and specifically when it is from the wine of the Sharon region in Eretz Yisrael. The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:

Daf 21a

For the purposes of the examination of blood, <b>the</b> wine <b>of the Sharon</b> region in Eretz Yisrael <b>has the same status as undiluted Carmelite</b> wine <b>and not diluted</b> Carmelite wine, <b>new</b> Carmelite wine <b>and not old</b> Carmelite wine.
<b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi says: And</b> in <b>all</b> cases of blood that has the color of diluted wine, <b>one examines</b> blood <b>only with a simple Tiberian cup.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason? Abaye says:</b> Containers are designed according to <b>a universal</b> standard, such that a cup that can <b>contain a <i>log</i></b> of wine, <b>one fashions it from</b> material weighing <b>one hundred dinars,</b> whereas a cup that can contain <b>two <i>log</i>, one fashions it from</b> material weighing <b>two hundred dinars.</b> By contrast, in the case of <b>a simple Tiberian cup, even</b> one that can <b>contain two <i>log</i>, one fashions it from</b> material weighing <b>one hundred dinars. And since</b> the material from which the cup is made <b>is weak,</b> it is more transparent and therefore the redness of the wine inside is <b>more noticeable.</b> Consequently, one must compare the blood to wine in a cup of this kind.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> an amorphous <b>piece</b> of tissue, <b>if there is blood</b> that emerges <b>with it,</b> the woman is <b>ritually impure</b> with the impurity of a menstruating woman. <b>And if not, she is pure,</b> as she is neither a menstruating woman nor a woman after childbirth. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> In <b>both this</b> case, where blood emerged, <b>and that</b> case, where no blood emerged, the woman <b>is impure</b> with the impurity of a menstruating woman, as there was certainly undetected blood that emerged with the flesh.
In the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> an item <b>similar to a shell,</b> or <b>similar to a hair,</b> or <b>similar to soil,</b> or <b>similar to mosquitoes,</b> if such items are <b>red, she should cast</b> them <b>into water</b> to ascertain their nature: <b>If they dissolved,</b> it is blood, and the woman <b>is impure</b> with the impurity of a menstruating woman; <b>and if not, she is pure.</b>
In the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> an item <b>similar to fish</b> or to <b>grasshoppers, repugnant creatures, or creeping animals, if there is blood</b> that emerges <b>with them,</b> the woman <b>is impure</b> with the impurity of a menstruating woman. <b>And if not, she is pure.</b>
With regard to a woman <b>who discharges</b> tissue in the form of <b>a type of domesticated animal, undomesticated animal, or bird, whether</b> it had the form of <b>a non-kosher</b> species or <b>a kosher</b> species, <b>if</b> it was <b>a male</b> fetus, then <b>she observes</b> the periods of impurity, seven days, and purity, thirty-three days, established in the Torah (see Leviticus 12:2–5) <b>for</b> a woman who gives birth to <b>a male. And if</b> the fetus was <b>a female,</b> the woman <b>observes</b> the periods of impurity, fourteen days, and purity, sixty-six days, established in the Torah <b>for</b> a woman who gives birth to <b>a female.</b>
<b>And if</b> the sex of the fetus <b>is unknown, she observes</b> the strictures that apply to a woman who gave birth both <b>to a male and to a female.</b> Accordingly, she is prohibited from engaging in intercourse for fourteen days, but after that, she will be permitted to engage in intercourse despite a discharge of uterine blood until thirty-three days pass after the seven days she would have been prohibited if the fetus were male. The prohibition to enter the Temple will continue until eighty days have passed from the discharge of the fetus. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: Any</b> fetus <b>that is not of human form is not</b> regarded as <b>an offspring</b> with regard to observance of these periods, and she is permitted to engage in intercourse provided that she does not experience a discharge of uterine blood.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if a woman discharges an amorphous piece of tissue and no blood emerges with it, the Rabbis say that she is pure, whereas Rabbi Yehuda says that she is impure. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Rabbi Yehuda deemed</b> the woman <b>impure,</b> despite the fact that no blood emerged, <b>only in</b> the case of <b>a piece</b> of tissue that has the appearance <b>of</b> one of <b>the four types of</b> ritually impure <b>blood,</b> as in such a case the piece has the status of blood. <b>But</b> if it has the appearance <b>of other types of blood,</b> the woman <b>is pure.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> there is a different explanation of the dispute: If a woman discharges a piece of tissue that has the appearance <b>of</b> one of <b>the four types of</b> ritually impure <b>blood, everyone,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis, <b>agrees</b> that she <b>is impure.</b> Likewise, if it has the appearance <b>of other types of blood, everyone agrees</b> that <b>she is pure.</b>
<b>They disagree only</b> with regard to a case <b>where</b> the woman <b>discharged</b> an amorphous piece of tissue, <b>and she</b> herself <b>does not know</b> exactly <b>what</b> was the appearance of the piece of tissue that <b>she discharged,</b> e.g., if it was lost. <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds: Follow the majority of</b> discharges of amorphous <b>pieces</b> of tissue, <b>and the majority of pieces</b> of tissue <b>are</b> of the appearance <b>of</b> one of the <b>four types of</b> impure <b>blood. And the Rabbis hold: We do not say</b> that <b>the majority of pieces</b> of flesh have the appearance <b>of</b> one of the <b>four types of</b> impure <b>blood.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But when Rav Hoshaya came from Neharde’a, he came and brought a <i>baraita</i> with him</b> that states: In the case of a woman <b>who discharges a piece</b> of tissue that is <b>red, black, green, or white, if there is blood</b> that emerges <b>with it,</b> the woman <b>is impure, and if not, she is pure. Rabbi Yehuda says: Both</b> in <b>this</b> case, where blood emerged, <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, where no blood emerged, the woman <b>is impure.</b> This <i>baraita</i> poses <b>a difficulty to</b> the statement of <b>Shmuel with regard to one</b> aspect of his opinion, <b>and</b> it poses a difficulty <b>to</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan with regard to two</b> aspects of his opinion.
The Gemara elaborates: It poses a difficulty <b>to</b> the statement of <b>Shmuel with regard to one</b> aspect of his opinion, <b>as Shmuel said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda deemed</b> the woman <b>impure only in</b> the case of <b>a piece</b> of tissue that has the appearance <b>of</b> one of <b>the four types of</b> impure <b>blood, and</b> yet the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that according to the Rabbis the woman is pure if the piece of tissue is <b>green or white,</b> which are not among the four colors of ritually impure blood, <b>and</b> that Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagrees</b> with their opinion.
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>when Rabbi Yehuda disagrees</b> with the Rabbis, it is <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>a red or black</b> piece of tissue, as these are among the four colors of ritually impure blood, <b>but with regard to</b> the case of <b>a green or white</b> piece he does <b>not</b> disagree with them, i.e., he concedes that the woman is pure, this cannot be correct. The Gemara explains why that explanation of the <i>baraita</i> is not possible: <b>But</b> if so, <b>for</b> the sake of clarifying <b>whose</b> opinion <b>does</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> the case of <b>a green or white</b> piece of tissue?
<b>If we say</b> that it comes to clarify the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> that is unnecessary: <b>Now</b> that in a case of <b>a red or black</b> piece of tissue, which are among the four colors of ritually impure blood, <b>the Rabbis deem</b> the woman <b>pure, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state that they deem her pure in a case of <b>a green or white</b> piece? <b>Rather,</b> is it <b>not</b> coming <b>to</b> clarify the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> teaching that the Rabbis deem the woman pure in this case, <b>but</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagrees</b> with them and deems her impure? This contradicts the explanation of Shmuel.
<b>And furthermore,</b> the <i>baraita</i> poses an additional difficulty <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> in addition to the first difficulty explained above, <b>as he said</b> that if the piece of tissue has the appearance <b>of</b> one of <b>the four types of</b> ritually impure <b>blood</b> then <b>everyone agrees</b> that the woman <b>is impure,</b> and yet the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> the case of <b>a red or black</b> piece <b>and</b> states that <b>the Rabbis disagree</b> with Rabbi Yehuda and deem the woman pure.
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>when the Rabbis disagree</b> with Rabbi Yehuda, it is <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>a green or white</b> piece of tissue, <b>but in</b> the case of <b>a red or black</b> piece they do <b>not</b> disagree with him, as they concede that the woman is impure; <b>but</b> if that is so, then <b>for</b> the sake of clarifying <b>whose</b> opinion <b>does</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> the case of <b>a red or black</b> piece?
<b>If we say</b> that it comes to clarify the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> this is unnecessary: <b>Now</b> that Rabbi Yehuda holds that in a case of <b>a green or white</b> piece the woman <b>is impure,</b> despite the fact that they are not among the four colors of ritually impure blood, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state that she is impure in a case of <b>a red or black</b> piece? <b>Rather,</b> is it <b>not</b> coming to clarify the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> teaching that Rabbi Yehuda deems the woman impure in this case, <b>but the Rabbis disagree</b> with him and maintain that she is pure?
<b>Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says</b> there is a different explanation of the dispute between the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda: <b>They disagree with regard to</b> whether or not <b>opening of the womb is possible without</b> a discharge of <b>blood. And</b> they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute between these <i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman experienced <b>difficulty in labor</b> during which blood emerged on <b>two</b> consecutive days, <b>and on the third</b> day <b>she discharged, but she does not know what she discharged,</b> i.e., whether it was a stillborn human fetus, and whether blood emerged during the miscarriage,

Daf 21b

<b>it is uncertain</b> whether <b>that</b> woman has the status of one who gave <b>birth,</b> and it is <b>uncertain</b> whether she has the status of a woman who experiences <b>an irregular discharge of blood from the uterus [<i>ziva</i>].</b> Therefore, <b>she brings an offering,</b> like any woman after childbirth or after <i>ziva</i>, <b>but</b> the offering <b>is not eaten</b> by the priests. The reason is that perhaps she neither gave birth nor experienced <i>ziva</i>, and is therefore exempt from bringing an offering. Consequently, her bird sin offering is disqualified, and is forbidden in consumption, as a bird offering is killed by pinching its neck, which is not the valid manner of slaughtering a non-sacred bird.
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> The woman <b>brings an offering, and it is eaten.</b> The reason is that she is certainly either a woman after childbirth or a <i>zava</i>, <b>as opening of the womb is not possible without</b> a discharge of <b>blood.</b> The <i>tanna’im</i> in the <i>baraita</i> disagree about whether opening of the womb is possible without a discharge of blood. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak maintains that this is also the issue in dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis in the mishna.
§ <b>Some say another version</b> of the above discussion. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Rabbi Yehuda deemed</b> the woman <b>impure,</b> despite the fact that no blood emerged, <b>only in</b> the case of <b>a piece</b> of tissue that has the appearance <b>of</b> one of the <b>four types of</b> ritually impure <b>blood, but</b> if it has the appearance <b>of other types of blood,</b> the woman <b>is pure.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But when Rav Hoshaya came from Neharde’a, he came and brought a <i>baraita</i> with him</b> that states: In the case of a woman <b>who discharges a piece</b> of tissue that is <b>red, or black, green, or white, if there is blood</b> that emerges <b>with it,</b> the woman <b>is impure, and if not, she is pure. And Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> In <b>both this</b> case, where blood emerged, <b>and that</b> case, where no blood emerged, the woman <b>is impure.</b>
The Gemara concludes its challenge: The <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> both a case where the piece of tissue is <b>red or black,</b> and a case where it is not one of the four types of impure blood but it is <b>green or white,</b> i.e., in all of these cases the Rabbis hold that the woman is pure, <b>and</b> yet <b>Rabbi Yehuda disagrees</b> with their opinion.
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>when Rabbi Yehuda disagrees</b> with the Rabbis, it is <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>a red or black</b> piece of tissue, <b>but</b> with regard to the case of a <b>green or white</b> piece he does <b>not</b> disagree with them, as he concedes that the woman is pure; <b>but</b> if that is so, <b>for</b> the sake of clarifying <b>whose</b> opinion does the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> the case of <b>a green or white</b> piece of tissue?
<b>If we say</b> that it comes <b>to</b> clarify the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> that is unnecessary: <b>Now</b> that in the case of <b>a red or black</b> piece of tissue <b>the Rabbis deem</b> the woman <b>pure, is it necessary</b> to state that they deem her pure in a case of <b>a green or white</b> piece? <b>Rather, is it not</b> coming <b>to</b> clarify the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> teaching that the Rabbis deem the woman pure in this case, <b>but</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagrees</b> with them and deems her impure? This contradicts the explanation of Shmuel.
<b>Rather, Rav Yehuda says</b> there is a different explanation of the dispute between the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda: <b>They disagree with regard to</b> whether or not <b>opening of the womb is possible without</b> a discharge of <b>blood. And</b> they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute between these <i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman experienced <b>difficulty in labor</b> during which blood emerged on <b>two</b> consecutive days, <b>and on the third</b> day <b>she discharged, but she does not know what she discharged, it is uncertain</b> whether she has the status of a woman who gave <b>birth,</b> and it is <b>uncertain</b> whether she has the status of a woman who experienced <b><i>ziva</i>.</b> Therefore <b>she brings an offering, but it is not eaten</b> by the priests.
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> The woman <b>brings an offering, and it is eaten.</b> The reason is that she is certainly either a woman after childbirth or a <i>zava</i>, <b>as opening of the womb is not possible without</b> a discharge of <b>blood.</b> This is also the matter in dispute between the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> an amorphous <b>piece</b> of tissue, <b>Sumakhos says in the name of Rabbi Meir, and likewise Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya would say in accordance with his statement:</b> A Sage who is presented with this piece of tissue should <b>tear it</b> to examine it. <b>If there is blood inside it,</b> the woman is <b>ritually impure, and if not, she is pure.</b>
The Gemara compares this <i>baraita</i> to the ruling of the mishna: This statement is basically <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> in the mishna, <b>but it is</b> more <b>far-reaching,</b> i.e., more stringent, <b>than that</b> ruling of <b>the Rabbis. It is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, as they say</b> that <b>opening of the womb is possible without</b> a discharge of <b>blood,</b> whereas Rabbi Yehuda maintains that opening of the womb is impossible without a discharge of blood. <b>But</b> the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is more <b>far-reaching than that</b> ruling of <b>the Rabbis, as they hold</b> that if blood emerges <b>with</b> the piece of tissue, then <b>yes,</b> the woman is impure, but if blood is found <b>inside</b> the piece of tissue, she is <b>not</b> impure; <b>and Sumakhos holds</b> that <b>even</b> if blood is found <b>inside</b> the piece, the woman is impure.
<b>And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> with regard to a woman <b>who discharges</b> an amorphous <b>piece</b> of tissue, that <b>Rabbi Aḥa says:</b> One <b>tears it</b> open, and <b>if its interior looks red,</b> even if it contains no blood, the woman <b>is impure; and if</b> it does <b>not</b> have a red appearance, <b>she is pure.</b>
The Gemara compares this <i>baraita</i> to the aforementioned opinion of Sumakhos: This ruling of Rabbi Aḥa is basically <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Sumakhos,</b> as Rabbi Aḥa also requires that the interior of the piece of tissue must be examined to see if there is blood on the inside, <b>but</b> it is more <b>far-reaching than</b> the opinion of <b>Sumakhos,</b> as Rabbi Aḥa deems the woman impure even if the piece of tissue merely looks red on the inside but does not contain blood.
<b>And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> with regard to a woman <b>who discharges</b> an amorphous <b>piece</b> of tissue, that <b>Rabbi Binyamin says</b> one <b>tears it</b> open to examine it. <b>If it contains a bone,</b> it is considered a fetus, and <b>its mother is impure</b> with the impurity of a woman who gave <b>birth. Rav Ḥisda says: And</b> this applies <b>in</b> the case of <b>a white piece</b> of flesh; only in such a situation does the existence of a bone render it a fetus. <b>And likewise, when a pair</b> of Torah scholars <b>came from Ḥadyab, they came and brought a <i>baraita</i> with them:</b> In the case of a woman <b>who discharges a white piece</b> of tissue, one <b>tears it</b> open to examine it, and <b>if it contains a bone, its mother is impure</b> with the impurity of a woman who gave <b>birth.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> With regard to a woman <b>who discharges</b> an amorphous <b>piece</b> of tissue, one <b>tears it</b> open to examine it. <b>If it contains</b> a quantity of <b>accumulated blood,</b> the woman <b>is impure; and if not, she is pure.</b> The Gemara comments: This is basically <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Sumakhos,</b> that blood found inside the piece of tissue renders the woman impure, <b>but it is more lenient than all</b> the previous opinions, i.e., Sumakhos and Rabbi Aḥa, as according to Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai the woman is rendered impure only if there is a quantity of accumulated blood.
§ <b>Rabbi Yirmeya asked Rabbi Zeira:</b> In the case of a woman <b>who</b> inserted a tube into her vagina and <b>sees blood,</b> i.e., she found blood <b>in</b> the <b>tube, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Yirmeya clarified his question: Since it is stated: “And if a woman has an issue, and her issue <b>in her flesh</b> is blood, she shall be in her impurity seven days” (Leviticus 15:19), perhaps <b>the Merciful One states</b> in this verse that the woman is impure only if the blood is discharged through “her flesh” <b>and not through a tube. Or perhaps this</b> term: <b>“In her flesh,”</b> is <b>necessary</b> to teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>that</b> a woman <b>becomes impure</b> by finding blood <b>inside</b> her vagina <b>just as</b> she becomes impure by experiencing bleeding <b>outside</b> her vagina, i.e., once the blood enters the vaginal canal from the uterus the woman is ritually impure.
Rabbi Zeira <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>The Merciful One states: “In her flesh,”</b> meaning that the woman is impure only if the blood is discharged through “her flesh” <b>and not through a tube. As, if</b> the term <b>“in her flesh” is necessary</b> to teach <b>that</b> a woman <b>becomes impure</b> by finding blood <b>inside</b> her vagina <b>just as</b> by seeing blood <b>outside</b> her vagina, <b>if so, let the verse say: In the flesh. What</b> is the significance of the fact that the verse states: <b>“In her flesh”? Conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from</b> the term, both that a woman becomes impure by the presence of blood inside her vagina, and that a woman who experiences bleeding that emerged through a tube is ritually pure.
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> With regard to a woman <b>who discharges</b> an amorphous <b>piece</b> of tissue, one <b>tears it</b> open to examine it; <b>if it contains</b> a quantity of <b>accumulated blood,</b> the woman <b>is impure, and if not, she is pure?</b> If a woman who sees blood that emerged inside a piece of tissue becomes impure, the same should apply to a woman who sees blood that emerged through a tube.
The Gemara responds: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> with regard to a piece of tissue, the woman is impure, as <b>it is the manner of a woman to see blood inside</b> such <b>a piece</b> of tissue. Therefore, this blood fulfills the condition stated in the verse: “In her flesh.” By contrast, <b>here,</b> in the case of a tube, the woman should not be impure, as <b>it is not the manner of a woman to see blood</b> that emerged <b>through a tube.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>a tube is</b> subject to a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a woman <b>who discharges</b> an amorphous <b>piece</b> of tissue, <b>even though</b> the piece <b>is full of blood, if there is blood</b> on the outside that emerges <b>with it,</b> the woman <b>is impure; and if not, she is pure. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The term <b>“in her flesh”</b> teaches that a woman is rendered impure only by blood that emerges through direct contact with her flesh, <b>and not</b> by blood that emerges <b>in a gestational sac, nor</b> by blood that emerges <b>in</b> an amorphous <b>piece</b> of tissue.
The Gemara interrupts its citation of the <i>baraita</i> and asks: <b>Isn’t</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> identical to that of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>?</b> The first <i>tanna</i> also says that a woman does not become impure due to blood found in a piece of tissue. Rather, the entire <i>baraita</i> is the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, and one must <b>say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> should read as follows: Even if the piece of tissue is full of blood the woman is pure, <b>as Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that the term <b>“in her flesh”</b> teaches that a woman is rendered impure only by blood that emerges through direct contact with her flesh, <b>and not</b> by blood that emerges <b>in a gestational sac, nor</b> by blood that emerges <b>in a piece</b> of tissue.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> If there is blood in the piece of tissue, <b>this is not menstrual blood, but rather the blood of</b> the <b>piece</b> of tissue. The Gemara asks: Doesn’t <b>the first <i>tanna</i> also deem</b> the woman <b>pure?</b> What is the difference between the opinion of the Rabbis and that of the first <i>tanna</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the difference <b>between</b> the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> and that of the Rabbis <b>is</b> with regard to a case <b>where</b> the piece of tissue is <b>cracked,</b> and its blood comes in direct contact with the woman’s body.
<b>The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that the term <b>“in her flesh”</b> teaches that a woman is rendered impure only by blood that emerges through direct contact with her flesh, <b>and not</b> by blood that emerges <b>in a gestational sac, nor</b> by blood that emerges <b>in a piece</b> of tissue. <b>And the same is true with regard to</b> blood that emerges through <b>a tube. But this statement</b> applies only in a case <b>where</b> the piece of tissue is <b>smooth, but</b> if it is <b>cracked,</b> the woman is <b>impure. What is the reason for</b> this exception? Since the blood comes in direct contact with the woman’s flesh, <b>we read</b> the term <b>“in her flesh” with regard to it,</b> i.e., it fulfills that condition.
<b>And the Rabbis come to say: Even though</b> the piece of tissue <b>is cracked,</b> the woman is pure, as <b>this is not menstrual blood but rather the blood of</b> the <b>piece</b> of tissue. It can be inferred from here <b>that</b> if the blood is <b>menstrual blood,</b> the woman <b>is certainly impure, and</b> this is true <b>even</b> if the blood emerges <b>through a tube.</b> Accordingly, the <i>halakha</i> in the case of a tube is subject to a dispute between <i>tanna’im</i>.
<b>Abaye says</b> that this suggestion should be rejected: <b>In</b> the case of <b>a tube, everyone agrees that</b> the woman <b>is pure,</b> as derived from the term “in her flesh.”

Daf 22a

<b>When they disagree,</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> the case of blood that is found in <b>a piece</b> of tissue. One <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, who follows the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is the manner of a woman to see</b> menstrual <b>blood in a piece</b> of tissue that she discharges. Therefore, the term “in her flesh” applies to the blood in the cracks. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is not the manner of a woman to see</b> menstrual <b>blood in a piece</b> of tissue that she discharges. Therefore, the blood found in the piece of tissue is not considered menstrual blood, and it does not render the woman impure.
<b>Rava says</b> there is another explanation of this dispute: <b>Everyone,</b> both the first <i>tanna</i> and the Rabbis, agrees that <b>it is not the manner of a woman to see</b> menstrual <b>blood in a piece</b> of tissue that she discharges. Consequently, the blood that emerges from the cracks in the piece of tissue is not considered menstrual blood, and it does not render the woman impure.
<b>And here, they disagree</b> as <b>to</b> whether it is possible that the <b>woman</b> herself is <b>pure but the location of the source,</b> i.e., the uterus, <b>is impure. As Rabbi Eliezer holds</b> that the <b>woman is pure,</b> i.e., she was not rendered a menstruating woman with the discharge of the blood, <b>but the blood is impure,</b> despite the fact that it emerged in a piece of tissue, <b>as it emerged through the source,</b> which is impure. Therefore, when the blood comes into contact with the woman’s body she contracts first-degree impurity, and the woman subsequently transmits impurity to foods that she touches. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that the <b>woman is</b> entirely <b>pure, and the location of the source is</b> also <b>pure.</b> Therefore, pure food that she touches is not rendered impure.
§ <b>Rabba asked Rav Huna</b> a similar question to the case of the tube: With regard to a man <b>who sees semen</b> by extracting it from his penis <b>with a sliver of wood, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does he assume the impurity status of one who experiences a seminal emission? The Gemara explains the question. The verse states: “A man from whom the flow of semen emerges” (Leviticus 22:4). Since <b>the Merciful One states: “From whom,”</b> is it derived that the man is not impure <b>unless</b> the semen <b>emerges from his flesh</b> by itself, <b>and not</b> when it is extracted <b>with a sliver of wood? Or perhaps</b> from <b>this</b> term: <b>“From whom,”</b> it is derived merely that the man is not impure <b>unless his impurity,</b> i.e., his semen, <b>emerges outside</b> his body, <b>but</b> he is impure <b>even</b> if this is achieved <b>with a sliver of wood.</b>
Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rabba: <b>Derive</b> that the man is pure from the fact <b>that</b> semen <b>itself becomes impure only in</b> a case where the discharge is substantial enough to cause <b>a blockage of the tip of the penis.</b> Since this amount cannot be extracted with a sliver of wood, it is not impure.
Rabba replied to Rav Huna: Since a minimum measure is required for this impurity, <b>is this to say that</b> the reason a man who experiences a seminal emission is impure <b>is</b> that his penis <b>touches</b> the semen after it is emitted? If he was rendered impure merely by the emission of the semen then no minimum measure would apply, as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a menstruating woman. But <b>if that is so,</b> then a seminal emission <b>should not negate</b> the count of seven clean days <b>for</b> a man who experienced a gonorrhea-like <b>discharge [<i>ziva</i>].</b> A <i>zav</i> does not stop his counting when he touches a source of impurity, e.g., the carcass of a creeping animal.
If so, <b>why is it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is derived from the verse’s juxtaposition between a <i>zav</i> and one who experienced a seminal emission: <b>“This is the law of the <i>zav</i>, and of one from whom the flow of semen emerges”</b> (Leviticus 15:32), that <b>just as <i>ziva</i></b> during the seven clean days <b>negates</b> the count, <b>so too, a seminal emission negates</b> the count. If it is not the emission itself that renders the man impure but only his contact with the semen, why does the emission negate the count of seven clean days?
Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rabba in response: The <i>halakha</i> of <b>negation</b> is not difficult, as <b>this is the reason that</b> a seminal emission <b>negates</b> the count of seven clean days: <b>Because it is impossible for</b> a <i>zav</i> to experience a seminal emission <b>without</b> it containing <b>bits of [<i>tzaḥtzoḥei</i>] <i>ziva</i>.</b>
Rabba further objected: <b>If that is so,</b> then a seminal emission <b>should negate the entire</b> count of <b>seven</b> clean days, just like an emission of <i>ziva</i>, not merely the day on which the seminal emission occurred. But then <b>why is it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: It is derived from the verse: <b>“This is the law of the <i>zav</i>,</b> and of one from whom the flow of semen emerges, so that he is impure by it” (Leviticus 15:32), that <b>just as <i>ziva</i></b> during the seven clean days <b>negates</b> the count, <b>so too, a seminal emission negates</b> the count.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>If</b> a seminal emission is compared to <i>ziva</i>, then it might be suggested that <b>just as <i>ziva</i> negates the entire</b> count of <b>seven</b> days, <b>so too, a seminal emission</b> should <b>also negate the entire</b> count of <b>seven</b> days. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “So that he is impure by it,”</b> to teach that <b>in</b> the case of a seminal emission <b>you have</b> a negation of the count that is equivalent <b>only</b> to the impurity <b>that is stated by it,</b> i.e., impurity for one day. Accordingly, a seminal emission <b>negates</b> only <b>one day</b> of the count, not the entire count. This apparently contradicts Rav Huna’s statement that the reason a seminal emission negates the count at all is that the seminal emission of a <i>zav</i> always contains <i>ziva</i>.
Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rabba: <b>It is a Torah edict</b> that an emission that is <b>purely <i>ziva</i>, when semen is not mixed in it, negates the entire</b> count of <b>seven</b> days, whereas <b>bits of <i>ziva</i> in which</b> some <b>semen is mixed negate only one day</b> of the count.
§ <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, asked Rabbi Elazar:</b> If a woman discharges <b>dry blood, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does she have the status of a menstruating woman? The Gemara explains the dilemma: Since <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And <b>if</b> a woman <b>has a flow of her blood</b> many days” (Leviticus 15:25), does this indicate <b>that</b> the woman is not impure <b>unless</b> the blood <b>flows,</b> i.e., if it is <b>wet, yes,</b> she is impure, whereas if it is <b>dry</b> she is <b>not</b> impure? <b>Or perhaps this</b> phrase: <b>“If</b> a woman <b>has a flow of her blood,” is</b> merely referring to <b>the normal manner</b> that menstrual blood emerges, <b>but actually even dry</b> blood renders the woman impure.
Rabbi Elazar <b>said to him: You learned</b> the solution to your dilemma in a mishna (54b): <b>The blood of a menstruating woman and the flesh of a corpse impart impurity</b> whether they are <b>wet or dry.</b> Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, <b>said to him</b> in response: <b>I do not raise the dilemma</b> about blood that was <b>wet</b> when it came out <b>and</b> subsequently <b>dried,</b> as such blood is certainly impure. <b>When I raise the dilemma,</b> it is with regard to blood that was <b>dry at the outset,</b> when it emerged.
Rabbi Elazar responded: <b>You learned</b> the solution to <b>this</b> dilemma <b>as well,</b> in the mishna here: In the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> an item <b>similar to a shell,</b> or <b>similar to a hair,</b> or <b>similar to soil,</b> or <b>similar to mosquitoes,</b> if these are <b>red, she should cast</b> them <b>into water</b> to ascertain their nature.

Daf 22b

<b>If they dissolved,</b> it is blood, and the woman <b>is impure;</b> and if not, she is ritually pure. Evidently, dry blood is impure, as these items are all dry until they are soaked in water. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that dry blood is impure, these items are impure <b>also in</b> a case where <b>they do not dissolve</b> in water. Why is this examination necessary at all? <b>Rabba says:</b> In a case <b>where they do not dissolve,</b> this indicates that the item is not blood at all; rather, <b>it is a distinct entity.</b>
The Gemara asks with regard to these instances discussed in the mishna: <b>But are there</b> actually <b>cases like this?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes</b> there are, <b>and it is taught</b> likewise in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: My father raised two incidents from Tivin to</b> the Sages in <b>Yavne</b> for discussion.
The first was <b>an incident involving a woman who would</b> repeatedly <b>discharge</b> items <b>similar to red shells, and</b> the local residents <b>came and asked my father</b> whether this rendered the woman impure. <b>And my father asked the</b> other <b>Sages, and the Sages asked the doctors</b> what causes this to happen. <b>And</b> the doctors <b>said to them: This woman has a wound in her womb from which she discharges</b> red items <b>similar to shells.</b> The Sages therefore ruled that the woman <b>should cast</b> them <b>into water</b> to ascertain their nature. <b>If they dissolved,</b> it is blood and the woman <b>is impure.</b>
<b>And again</b> there was a similar <b>incident involving a woman who would discharge</b> items <b>similar to red hairs, and she came and asked my father</b> whether she was impure. <b>And my father asked the</b> other <b>Sages, and the Sages asked the doctors, and</b> the doctors <b>said to them:</b> The woman <b>has a mole in her womb from which she discharges</b> items <b>similar to red hairs.</b> The Sages therefore ruled that the woman <b>should cast</b> them <b>into water,</b> and <b>if they dissolved, she is impure.</b>
§ <b>Reish Lakish says: And</b> this examination is conducted only <b>with lukewarm [<i>uvefoshrin</i>]</b> water. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The woman <b>should cast</b> the item <b>into water, and</b> this examination is conducted only <b>with lukewarm</b> water. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> The woman <b>mashes</b> the item <b>with saliva,</b> using the fingers of one hand <b>on a fingernail</b> of her other hand. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between</b> the two opinions? <b>Ravina says:</b> The difference <b>between them is</b> whether an item is considered blood if it can be <b>mashed by pressing</b> on it, or only if the item dissolves by itself.
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna <b>there</b> (54b) with regard to an animal carcass or the carcass of a creeping animal that dried up, which is examined by soaking it in water to determine whether or not it still imparts impurity: For <b>how long is its soaking in lukewarm</b> water necessary? It is <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Here,</b> with regard to the examination of an item discharged by a woman, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do I need</b> it to be soaked in lukewarm water <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period, or not?</b>
The Gemara explains the question: Perhaps with regard to a carcass of <b>a creeping animal and an unslaughtered animal carcass, which are hard</b> when they dry up, <b>we require</b> soaking <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period, but blood, which is</b> relatively <b>soft</b> after it dries up, does <b>not</b> need to be soaked for that long. In other words, if the item did not dissolve after even a shorter period of time, it is not blood. <b>Or perhaps</b> the examination of a discharged item <b>is no different,</b> and it also must be soaked for twenty-four hours. The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The mishna teaches: In the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> an item <b>similar to fish</b> or to grasshoppers, repugnant creatures, or creeping animals, if blood emerges with it, the woman is impure, and if not, she is pure. The Gemara asks: <b>But let Rabbi Yehuda disagree</b> with the Rabbis <b>with regard to this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>as well,</b> just as he disagrees with them in the first clause of the mishna, in the case where a woman discharges an amorphous piece of tissue, as he maintains that she is impure whether or not blood emerges with it.
<b>Reish Lakish says:</b> This case is also <b>subject to</b> the <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis, <b>and</b> the opinion cited in the mishna <b>is</b> that of <b>the Rabbis. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the ruling of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as when <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that the woman is impure even if blood does not emerge, it is <b>only there, in</b> the case of an amorphous <b>piece</b> of tissue, <b>as</b> the <b>blood is likely to dry and turn into</b> the form of <b>a piece</b> of tissue. <b>But</b> blood is <b>not</b> likely to <b>become</b> the form of <b>a creature,</b> such as a fish or a grasshopper.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> this is difficult <b>according to that version</b> in <b>which Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis <b>disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>opening of the womb is impossible without</b> a discharge of <b>blood</b> (see 21b). Since <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> holds that blood automatically emerges whenever the womb opens, and therefore the woman is impure even if she did not notice any blood, he <b>should disagree</b> with the Rabbis <b>in this</b> case <b>too,</b> i.e., if a woman discharges an item similar to a fish or one of the other creatures.
The Gemara answers: <b>The one who teaches that version</b> of the above discussion <b>teaches</b> an alternative version of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion here as well, <b>like this:</b> With regard to a woman who discharges an item similar to fish, or to grasshoppers, repugnant creatures, or creeping animals, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish both say</b> that this case is <b>subject to a dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis, <b>and</b> the opinion stated in the mishna <b>is</b> that of <b>the Rabbis.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: In the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> tissue in the form of <b>a type of domesticated animal,</b> undomesticated animal, or bird, whether of a kosher or non-kosher species, if it is male, the woman observes the periods of impurity and purity for a woman who gives birth to a male. If it is female, the woman observes the periods of impurity and purity for a woman who gives birth to a female. And if its sex is unknown, the woman observes the strictures of a woman who gave birth to both a male and a female. This is the statement of Rabbi Meir.
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir,</b> that a woman who discharges a fetus in the form of an animal has the same status as one who discharges a fetus with human form or gives birth to a human? It is <b>since</b> the Torah uses a similar formulation in the two cases, as a term of <b>formation is stated with regard to</b> the creation of these types of animals, in the verse: “And out of the ground the Lord God formed every animal of the field, and every fowl of the air” (Genesis 2:19), <b>just as</b> it is stated with regard to the creation of <b>man:</b> “And the Lord God formed man” (Genesis 2:7).
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> then with regard to a woman <b>who discharges</b> an item with <b>the form of a sea monster, its mother should be impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth, since</b> the concept of <b>formation is stated with regard to</b> its creation, <b>just as</b> it is stated with regard to the creation of <b>man. As it is stated: “And God created the great sea monsters”</b> (Genesis 1:21).
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>One derives</b> <i>halakhot</i> of a matter with regard to which <b>formation</b> is stated by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> another matter with regard to which <b>formation</b> is stated, <b>but one does not derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> of a matter with regard to which <b>creation</b> is stated <b>from</b> a matter with regard to which <b>formation</b> is stated.
The Gemara asks: <b>What difference is</b> there between formation and creation? A verbal analogy can be drawn between different words with similar meanings. For example, <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses. The verse states: <b>“And the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]</b> on the seventh day” (Leviticus 14:39), and another verse with regard to the priest’s visit seven days later states: <b>“And the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]</b> and look” (Leviticus 14:44). <b>This returning</b> and <b>this coming</b> have the same meaning, and one can therefore derive by verbal analogy that the <i>halakha</i> that applies if the leprosy had spread at the conclusion of the first week applies if it had spread again by the end of the following week.
<b>And furthermore,</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a woman who discharges an item similar to a sea monster, with regard to which <b>creation</b> is stated, can be <b>derived</b> by a different verbal analogy <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of human offspring, since here it also states <b>creation, as it is written: “And God created man in His own image”</b> (Genesis 1:27).
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: The verse <b>“And</b> God <b>created</b> man” is necessary <b>to</b> teach the matter <b>itself,</b> i.e., the creation of man. By contrast, the term <b>“And</b> the Lord God <b>formed</b> man,” serves <b>to render it free,</b> i.e., the mention of the formation of man is superfluous in its context and was stated for the purpose of establishing a verbal analogy. <b>And</b> therefore <b>one derives</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of animals, with regard to which <b>formation</b> is stated, <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of man, with regard to which <b>formation</b> is stated.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>On the contrary,</b> one can say that the verse <b>“And</b> the Lord God <b>formed</b> man” was stated <b>to</b> teach the matter <b>itself,</b> whereas the term <b>“And</b> God <b>created</b> man” serves <b>to render it free; and</b> therefore <b>one derives</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of sea monsters, with regard to which <b>creation</b> is stated, <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of man, with regard to which <b>creation</b> is stated.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the reason it is animals and not sea monsters that are compared to man is that the term <b>“and…formed”</b> is <b>free on both sides,</b> i.e., <b>it is free with regard to man and it is free with regard to animals.</b> By contrast, the term <b>“and…created” is free with regard to man,</b> but <b>it is not free with regard to sea monsters.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the reason that the term “and…formed” that appears <b>with regard to animals</b> is considered <b>free? If we say</b> it is due to the fact <b>that it is written: “And God made the animals of the earth</b> after its kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind” (Genesis 1:25), <b>and it is</b> similarly <b>written: “And out of the ground the Lord God formed every animal of the field”</b> (Genesis 2:19), and therefore this verse is superfluous, but <b>with regard to</b> the <b>sea monster as well,</b> the expression “and…created” is <b>free, as it is written:</b> “And God made…<b>and everything that creeps on the ground</b> after its kind” (Genesis 1:25), <b>and it is</b> also <b>written: “And God created the great sea monsters.”</b> Consequently, the term “and…created” is also free on both sides of the verbal analogy.
The Gemara answers: The <b>creeping animal that is written there is</b> referring to creeping animals <b>of the land,</b> not of the sea. Therefore, the term: “And…created,” stated with regard to sea monsters is not superfluous. The Gemara asks: <b>But what difference is</b> there <b>between</b> a verbal analogy that is <b>free on one side and</b> a verbal analogy that is <b>free on both sides?</b>
The Gemara answers: The <b>difference</b> is with regard to that <b>which Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel says in the name of Rabbi Yishmael,</b> with regard to the exegetical principle of verbal analogy: With regard to <b>any verbal analogy that is not free at all, one cannot derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>from it.</b> If the verbal analogy is <b>free on one side, according to Rabbi Yishmael one can derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> from it, <b>and one cannot refute</b> it through logic, even if there are valid counterarguments. <b>According to the Rabbis, one can derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> from it, <b>but one can</b> also <b>refute</b> it logically if there are grounds to distinguish between the two cases. If a verbal analogy is <b>free on both sides, everyone agrees</b> that <b>one can derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> from it <b>and one cannot refute</b> it logically.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Yishmael, what</b> difference <b>is there between</b> a verbal analogy that is <b>free on one side and</b> a verbal analogy that is <b>free on both sides?</b> In both cases, he holds that one can derive <i>halakhot</i> from it and one cannot refute it. The Gemara answers: He holds that the <b>difference</b> is <b>that</b> in a case <b>where there</b> are two mutually exclusive verbal analogies, one that is <b>free on one side and</b> one that is <b>free on both sides, we disregard</b> the analogy that is <b>free on one side,</b>

Daf 23a

<b>and derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> from the analogy that is <b>free on both sides. And</b> it is <b>for this</b> reason that <b>the Merciful One rendered</b> the verbal analogy between <b>animal</b> and man <b>free on both sides, so that one would not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the verbal analogy between sea monster and man, which is <b>free on</b> only <b>one side.</b>
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, teaches in the name of Rabbi Elazar</b> a more <b>lenient</b> version of the aforementioned principle of exegesis of verbal analogy: With regard to <b>any verbal analogy that is not free at all, one can derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> from it, <b>but one can</b> also <b>refute</b> it logically. If the verbal analogy is <b>free on one side, according to Rabbi Yishmael one can derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> from it, <b>and one cannot refute</b> it. <b>According to the Rabbis, one can derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> from it, <b>but one can</b> also <b>refute</b> it. If the verbal analogy is <b>free on both sides, everyone agrees</b> that <b>one can derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> from it <b>and one cannot refute</b> it.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>according to the Rabbis, what</b> difference <b>is there between</b> a verbal analogy that is <b>free on one side and</b> one <b>that is not free at all?</b> In both cases, the Rabbis hold that one can derive <i>halakhot</i> from such a verbal analogy but one can also refute it.
The Gemara answers: The <b>difference</b> is in a case <b>where you find</b> two mutually exclusive verbal analogies, one that is <b>free on one side and</b> one <b>that is not free at all, and neither</b> does <b>this one have</b> a logical <b>refutation nor</b> does <b>that one have</b> a logical <b>refutation.</b> In such a case, <b>we disregard</b> the analogy <b>that is not free at all, and we derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the one that is <b>free on one side.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And here,</b> with regard to the verbal analogy between man and sea monster, which was rejected because it is free on only one side, <b>what</b> logical <b>refutation is there</b> on account of which this verbal analogy is rejected? The Gemara answers: The verbal analogy between man and sea monster is rejected <b>because it can be refuted</b> as follows: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about man?</b> Man is unique <b>in that</b> a person can <b>become impure while he is alive,</b> unlike an animal, which can become impure only after it dies, or a sea monster, which cannot become impure at all.
<b>And likewise, Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir,</b> that a woman who discharges an item similar to a domesticated animal, an undomesticated animal, or a bird is impure: It is <b>because formation is stated with regard to</b> the creation of these animals, <b>just as</b> it is stated with regard to the creation of <b>man.</b>
<b>Rabbi Ami said to him: If that is so,</b> then in the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> an item that has <b>the shape of a mountain, its mother</b> should be <b>impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth, as it is stated</b> with regard to the creation of mountains: <b>“For He Who forms the mountains and creates the wind”</b> (Amos 4:13). Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <b>said to him: Does she discharge a mountain?</b> The discharged item cannot possibly be that large. <b>It is</b> an item with the form of <b>a stone that she discharges,</b> and <b>that is called a clod,</b> not a mountain.
Rabbi Ami further inquired: <b>If that is so,</b> in the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> an item having <b>an amorphous form [<i>ruaḥ</i>], its mother should be impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth, since creation is stated with regard to it, just as</b> it is stated with regard to <b>man, as it is written: “And creates the wind [<i>ruaḥ</i>].” And if you would say</b> that no verbal analogy can be drawn here, because the verse <b>is not free,</b> i.e., it is not superfluous, as it is necessary to recount the creation of the wind, that is not so. Rabbi Ami explains: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the verse <b>could have written: Who forms the mountains and the wind, and</b> instead <b>it is written:</b> “Who forms the mountains <b>and creates the wind,” conclude from it</b> that the superfluous word “creates” serves <b>to render it free</b> for drawing a verbal analogy between <i>ruaḥ</i> and man.
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <b>said to</b> Rabbi Ami: <b>One derives matters</b> that are stated in the <b>Torah from matters</b> that are stated in the <b>Torah,</b> i.e., from verses in the Torah, <b>but one does not derive matters</b> that are stated in the <b>Torah from the words of the tradition,</b> i.e., verses in the Prophets or the Writings, such as the verse in Amos.
§ <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana</b> said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir: Since the eyes of</b> these animals <b>are similar to those of a human,</b> a woman who discharges an item of that type is impure.
The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> then in the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> an item that has <b>the form of a snake, its mother should</b> likewise <b>be impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth, since the pupil of</b> a snake <b>is round, like</b> that <b>of a human. And if you would say</b> that <b>indeed,</b> this is the <i>halakha</i>, then <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> this case of a woman who discharges an item that has the form of <b>a snake</b> among the other cases where the woman discharges an item of an unusual form.
The Gemara explains: <b>If</b> the mishna had <b>taught</b> the case of <b>a snake, I would say</b> that it <b>is</b> only <b>in</b> the case of a woman who discharges an item having the form of <b>a snake that the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Meir</b> and rule that the woman is not impure, <b>as</b> a term of <b>formation is not written with regard to</b> the creation of the snake. <b>But</b> with regard to a woman who discharges an item having the form of <b>a domesticated animal or an undomesticated animal, they do not disagree</b> with Rabbi Meir, <b>as</b> the concept of <b>formation is written with regard to them.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>blemishes</b> that render the slaughter of a firstborn animal permitted, <b>it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 40a) that an animal <b>whose pupil is round like</b> that <b>of a human</b> is considered blemished. Evidently, the eyes of animals are dissimilar to those of humans. The Gemara answers that it is <b>not difficult; this</b> statement, that the eyes of animals are similar to those of humans, is referring <b>to</b> the <b>pupil,</b> and <b>that</b> statement, that the eyes of animals are not similar to those of humans, is referring <b>to</b> the entire eyeball in the <b>socket.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Yannai said: This is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir:</b> It is <b>because the eyes of</b> these animals <b>are fixed in the front of</b> their heads <b>like</b> those <b>of a human,</b> unlike the eyes of birds and snakes, a woman who discharges an item of that kind is impure. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> there is the case of a woman who discharges an item similar to <b>a bird, whose eyes are not fixed in the front of</b> its head, <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>Rabbi Meir says that</b> the woman <b>is impure.</b> This apparently contradicts Rabbi Yannai’s explanation. <b>Abaye said:</b> Rabbi Meir is referring <b>to</b> the <b>little owl [<i>bekarya</i>] and</b> the <b>great owl [<i>vekifofa</i>],</b> whose eyes are fixed in the front of their heads, <b>but in</b> the case of a woman who discharges any of the <b>other</b> species of <b>birds,</b> Rabbi Meir does <b>not</b> deem her impure.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this answer from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says: The statement of Rabbi Meir seems</b> correct <b>in</b> the case of a woman who discharges the form of <b>a domesticated animal or an undomesticated animal, and the statement of the Rabbis</b> seems correct <b>in</b> the case of <b>birds.</b>
The Gemara asks: To <b>what birds</b> is Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus referring? <b>If we say</b> he is referring <b>to</b> the <b>little owl and</b> the <b>great owl, what is the difference</b> between this case and the cases of <b>a domesticated animal or an undomesticated animal,</b> with regard to which Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus accepts the opinion of Rabbi Meir? If the key factor is <b>that their eyes are fixed in the front of</b> their heads <b>like</b> those <b>of a human,</b> Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus should accept the opinion of Rabbi Meir in the case of <b>a little owl or a great owl as well,</b> as their eyes are also fixed in the front of their heads.
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that when Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says that he does not accept the opinion of Rabbi Meir, he is referring <b>to</b> the <b>other</b> species of <b>birds. From the fact</b> that it is necessary for Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus to reject Rabbi Meir’s opinion in those cases, it may be concluded that <b>Rabbi Meir</b> himself <b>disagrees</b> with the Rabbis <b>with regard to</b> the <b>other</b> species of <b>birds</b> as well, despite the fact that their eyes are not fixed in the front of their heads.
The Gemara explains that the <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete, and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching: Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says: The statement of Rabbi Meir seems</b> correct <b>in</b> the case of <b>a domesticated animal or an undomesticated animal, and the same is true with regard to a little owl or a great owl. And the statement of the Rabbis</b> appears correct even to Rabbi Meir <b>with regard to</b> the <b>other</b> species of <b>birds.</b> The reason is <b>that even Rabbi Meir</b> agrees that if a woman discharges an item that has the form of one of the other species of birds, she is not impure, i.e., he <b>disagrees with them only with regard to a little owl or a great owl, but he concedes to</b> their opinion <b>with regard to</b> the <b>other</b> species of <b>birds.</b>
The Gemara cites proof for Abaye’s claim that Rabbi Meir differentiates between an owl and other species of birds, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says:</b> In the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> an item that has the form of <b>a type of domesticated animal or undomesticated animal, according to the statement of Rabbi Meir</b> it has the halakhic status of a full-fledged <b>offspring, and according to the statement of the Rabbis,</b> it does <b>not</b> have the status of a full-fledged <b>offspring. In</b> the case of a woman who discharges an item that has the form of <b>birds, it must be examined.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>According to whom must it be examined?</b> Is this <b>not</b> referring <b>to the statement of Rabbi Meir, who said</b> that if a woman discharges an item that has the form of <b>a little owl or a great owl, yes,</b> she is impure, but if she discharges an item that has the form of <b>other birds,</b> she is <b>not</b> impure? Consequently, the item must be examined to determine what type of bird it resembles.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: No,</b> this <i>baraita</i> does not prove that Rabbi Meir differentiates between owls and other species of birds, as perhaps the statement that the discharged item <b>must be examined</b> applies <b>according to the Rabbis, as they say</b> that if a woman discharges an item that has the form of <b>a little owl or a great owl, yes,</b> she is impure, but if a woman discharges an item that has the form of <b>other birds,</b> she is <b>not</b> impure.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the Rabbis hold that a woman who discharges an item similar to a land animal is not impure, why would they hold that if she discharges an item that has the form of owls she is impure? <b>What is the difference</b> between <b>a little owl and a great owl</b> on the one hand, and <b>a domesticated animal and an undomesticated animal</b> on the other? The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> owls <b>have cheeks like</b> those of <b>a human,</b> therefore a woman who discharges an item similar to an owl is impure, whereas if she discharges an item that has the form of a land animal she is pure, despite the fact that their eyes are fixed in the front of their heads.
§ <b>Rabbi Yirmeya asked Rabbi Zeira: According to Rabbi Meir, who said</b> that <b>an animal in the womb of a woman is</b> considered <b>a full-fledged offspring, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in a case where it is a female, and <b>her father accepted betrothal for her,</b> i.e., he married her off by accepting betrothal money from a man, or a document of betrothal? Is such a betrothal valid? Rabbi Yirmeya elaborated: <b>What</b> practical <b>difference is</b> there whether it is valid? The difference is <b>with regard to</b> whether it is <b>prohibited</b> for the man <b>to</b> marry <b>her sister.</b> If the betrothal is valid, it is prohibited for the husband to marry her sister, as one may not marry his wife’s sister.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> such an offspring <b>can live?</b> This factor is important, as a man is prohibited from marrying his wife’s sister only during his wife’s lifetime. <b>But doesn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Rav says: Rabbi Meir said</b> that a woman who discharges an item that has the form of an animal is impure <b>only since</b> there are other animals <b>of its type</b> that can <b>live,</b> i.e., there are animals similar to the discharged item that do survive, but not that creature itself. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov says: Rabbi Yirmeya tried this hard to cause Rabbi Zeira to laugh, but he did not laugh.</b> In other words, Rabbi Yirmeya was not asking his question seriously.
The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Rabbi Meir said</b> that a woman who discharges an item that has the form of an animal is impure <b>only since</b> there are animals <b>of its type</b> that can <b>live. Rav Yirmeya of Difti says:</b>

Daf 23b

<b>We, too, learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 46a) that the fetus of a woman that has the form of an animal cannot survive: In the case of a woman <b>who</b> had previously <b>discharged a fetus</b> with the appearance <b>similar to</b> that <b>of a domesticated animal, an undomesticated animal, or bird</b> before giving birth to any children, and subsequently she gives birth to a son, the son is considered a firstborn with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of inheritance, but he does not require redemption, as the fetus is considered a full-fledged offspring in that regard. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> The son is not exempted from the requirement of redemption from a priest <b>unless</b> it follows the birth of a fetus <b>that takes the form of a person;</b> otherwise, it is not considered the offspring that “opens the womb” (Exodus 13:2), and the son requires redemption as a firstborn.
<b>And</b> in the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> a fetus in the form of <b>a sandal fish, or</b> from whom <b>an afterbirth or a gestational sac</b> in which <b>tissue developed</b> emerged, <b>or</b> who delivered a fetus <b>that emerged in pieces,</b> the son <b>that follows them is</b> considered <b>a firstborn with regard to inheritance but is not a firstborn with regard to</b> redemption from <b>a priest.</b> The Gemara explains the proof: <b>And if it enters your mind that</b> a fetus that has the form of an animal <b>can survive, is the</b> son <b>that follows it a firstborn with regard to inheritance?</b>
<b>Rava said,</b> in rejection of this proof: <b>Actually,</b> it is possible <b>that</b> a fetus shaped like an animal <b>can survive; but it is different there,</b> with regard to inheritance. The son that follows such a fetus has the status of a firstborn, <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to the inheritance of a firstborn: “By giving him a double portion of all that he has; for he is <b>the first fruits of his strength [<i>ono</i>];</b> the right of the firstborn is his” (Deuteronomy 21:17). It is derived from the verse that the status of a firstborn applies only to a son <b>over whose</b> death a father would <b>mourn.</b> The word <i>ono</i> is interpreted homiletically based on its similarity to the word <i>onen</i>, acute mourner. <b>This</b> offspring that has the form of an animal is therefore <b>excluded, as</b> its father <b>would not mourn over its</b> death.
§ <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava asked Abaye: According to Rabbi Meir, who said</b> that an item that is similar to <b>an animal in the womb of a woman is</b> considered <b>a full-fledged offspring, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a human</b> fetus <b>in the womb of an animal?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> of this inquiry? The difference is <b>with regard to permitting</b> the fetus <b>in consumption.</b> A full-fledged fetus found inside its slaughtered mother is permitted to be eaten, despite the fact that it was not slaughtered itself.
The Gemara suggests: <b>But</b> one can <b>resolve</b> the dilemma <b>from that</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> In the case of <b>one who slaughters an animal and finds in it</b> an item that has <b>the form of a pigeon,</b> the pigeon <b>is prohibited for consumption.</b> Evidently, the ritual slaughter of a pregnant animal renders its fetus permitted to be eaten only if the fetus is of the same species as the mother. Accordingly, if the fetus has the form of a human, it is prohibited for consumption.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> with regard to a pigeon fetus, <b>there are no</b> split <b>hooves, and there is not</b> even <b>a hoof</b> at all. Since a pigeon is completely different from the slaughtered animal, the fetus is forbidden. By contrast, <b>here,</b> in the case of a human fetus, <b>although there are no</b> split <b>hooves, there is at least a hoof,</b> i.e., solid feet. Therefore, it is possible that the human fetus is permitted for consumption, and the dilemma remains unresolved.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And the Rabbis say: Any</b> discharged entity <b>that is not</b> of human form does not render the woman impure. <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rav says: All concede</b> that if a woman discharged an entity <b>whose body is</b> that of <b>a goat and whose face is</b> that of <b>a human,</b> it is considered <b>a human</b> offspring, i.e., even the Rabbis rule that the woman is impure in this case. Likewise, if <b>its body is</b> that of <b>a human and its face is</b> that of <b>a goat,</b> Rabbi Meir concedes that <b>it is nothing,</b> and the woman is pure.
<b>They disagree only</b> in a case <b>where its face is</b> that of <b>a human, but it was created with</b> one human eye and <b>one eye like</b> that of <b>an animal. As Rabbi Meir says</b> that if the offspring has part <b>of the form of a human</b> face, even if one eye is not like that of a human, it is considered a human offspring, and the woman is impure. <b>And the Rabbis say</b> that it must have <b>the entire form of a human</b> face to be considered a human offspring, and otherwise the woman is not impure.
One of the Sages <b>said to Rav Yirmeya bar Abba: But isn’t the opposite taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that a woman who discharged is impure if the fetus has <b>any</b> part of the <b>form</b> of a human face, <b>and the Rabbis say</b> that the woman is impure only if the fetus has a recognizable part <b>of the form of</b> a human face, e.g., half of a human face? According to this <i>baraita</i>, Rabbi Meir does not even require that a significant part of it must look human. In his opinion, even if it has only one human eye or one human cheek and the rest of the face is like that of an animal, the woman is impure. Rav Yirmeya bar Abba <b>said to</b> the Sages: <b>If this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught, it is taught,</b> and I cannot take issue with it. I have my tradition from Rav, and you should rule in accordance with the <i>baraita</i> that you received.
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> A woman who discharges an entity is impure only if the entire face of the fetus has a human form. This includes its <b>forehead, and the eyebrows, and the eyes, and the cheeks, and</b> its <b>chin.</b> The woman is not impure <b>unless</b> these facial features <b>all as one</b> have the human form. <b>Rava</b> says that <b>Ḥasa says:</b> It is sufficient for the fetus to have the appearance of a human on one side of its face; its <b>forehead, and</b> one <b>eyebrow, and</b> one <b>eye, and</b> one <b>cheek, and</b> its <b>chin</b> are enough. The woman is not impure <b>unless</b> these facial features <b>all as one</b> have the human form.
<b>And</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan and Ḥasa <b>do not disagree</b> about whether the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir or that of the Rabbis, as they both accept the opinion of the Rabbis. The difference between them is that <b>this</b> <i>amora</i>, Rabbi Yoḥanan, holds <b>like the one who says</b> that the Rabbis require <b>the entire form of</b> the face to be human, and <b>that</b> <i>amora</i>, Ḥasa, holds <b>like the one who says</b> that the Rabbis require only a recognizable part <b>of the form of</b> a human face.
Ḥasa evidently interprets the version of the Rabbis’ statement that only part of a human face is required as referring to half of a human face. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this interpretation from a <i>baraita</i>: The miscarriage of a fetus with <b>the form of</b> a human <b>face, which</b> the Rabbis <b>said</b> renders the woman impure, includes <b>even one of the facial features, apart from the ear.</b> Apparently, <b>that is to say that</b> even <b>if</b> the fetus has only <b>one</b> facial feature of a human, this <b>is also sufficient</b> to render the woman impure.
<b>Abaye says: When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught, it is taught with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>rendering</b> all of the facial features <b>indispensable</b> for the fetus to be defined as human, except for the ear. <b>And</b> this ruling <b>is in accordance with the one who says</b> that the Rabbis require that <b>the entire form of</b> the face must be human. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>actually</b> this ruling <b>is in accordance with the one who says</b> that the Rabbis require only a recognizable part <b>of the form of</b> a human face. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of the claim that it is sufficient for the fetus to have <b>one</b> facial feature of a human? It means <b>one of each</b> facial feature of which a human has two, i.e., one eye, one eyebrow, and so on.
<b>Rava says:</b> In a case where a fetus <b>was created with one eye or with one thigh,</b> if the eye is located <b>to the side</b> on the middle of the face, or the thigh is located at the side of the hip, where a human eye or thigh is normally located, the fetus is considered human, and <b>its mother is impure.</b> If it appears <b>in the middle</b> of the face or hip, the fetus is not considered human, and <b>its mother is pure.</b>
<b>Rava says:</b> If <b>its esophagus is punctured,</b> although the fetus is considered a <i>tereifa</i>, i.e., one that has a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months, <b>its mother is impure.</b> But if <b>its esophagus is sealed,</b> i.e., it is closed at one end, it does not have the status of a human fetus, and therefore <b>its mother is pure.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> a fetus that has <b>a sealed body, its mother is not impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth. And what is a sealed body? Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> It is a body which is lacking a limb that <b>when removed from a living</b> person would cause him to <b>die.</b>
<b>And how much</b> of the lower part of a person’s body <b>when removed from a living</b> person would cause him to <b>die,</b> because one cannot survive such a wound? <b>Rabbi Zakkai says:</b>

Daf 24a

<b>Until</b> above <b>the knee. Rabbi Yannai says: Until his orifices. Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Yehoshua: Until the location of his navel.</b>
The Gemara explains the dispute between the <i>amora’im</i>: The difference <b>between</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Zakkai and</b> that of <b>Rabbi Yannai</b> is whether <b>a <i>tereifa</i> can survive</b> beyond twelve months. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yannai, <b>holds</b> that <b>a <i>tereifa</i> can survive</b> beyond twelve months. Therefore, although one whose legs were removed until above the knee has the status of a <i>tereifa</i>, if a woman discharges a fetus of this form she is impure. Only if the fetus lacks legs until his orifices is the woman pure, as such a person cannot survive. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Zakkai, <b>holds</b> that <b>a <i>tereifa</i> cannot survive</b> beyond twelve months. Therefore, even if the fetus lacks legs only from above the knee and not from his orifices, the woman is not impure.
The difference <b>between</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yannai and</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who both agree that a <i>tereifa</i> can survive, is with regard to a statement <b>of Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar said:</b> If the <b>thigh,</b> i.e., the hind leg of the animal, <b>and its recess were removed</b> from an animal before slaughter, the animal is considered <b>an unslaughtered carcass;</b> consequently, it is forbidden in consumption and imparts ritual impurity even while still alive. Rabbi Yannai agrees with the statement of Rabbi Elazar, and accordingly holds that if the lower part of a person’s body until his orifices is missing or removed, the person immediately assumes the halakhic status of a corpse. Rabbi Yoḥanan disagrees with Rabbi Elazar and holds that one whose lower part of his body was missing or removed has the status of a corpse only if it is removed until his navel.
<b>Rav Pappa says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between the <i>amora’im</i> is with regard to a fetus that is lacking part of its body <b>from below</b> to <b>above,</b> i.e., the lower part of his body; <b>but</b> if it is lacking part of its body <b>from above</b> to <b>below, even any amount</b> of its skull, the woman <b>is pure. And likewise, Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> a fetus <b>whose skull is sealed,</b> i.e., deficient, <b>its mother is pure.</b>
The Gemara cites another <i>halakha</i>: <b>And Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> a fetus that looks <b>like</b> the part <b>of a palm tree</b> that <b>branches out,</b> i.e., the lower part of its body is formless while the upper part has arms and legs coming out of its shoulders like branches, <b>its mother is pure.</b>
§ It <b>was stated</b> with regard to a woman <b>who discharges</b> a fetus <b>whose face is mashed</b> but not completely flattened, that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says its mother is impure,</b> and <b>Reish Lakish says its mother is pure.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a woman <b>who discharges a shaped hand,</b> i.e., a hand whose fingers are discernible, <b>or a shaped foot, its mother is impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth,</b> as it certainly came from a full-fledged fetus, <b>and we are not concerned</b> that <b>perhaps it came from</b> a fetus with <b>a sealed,</b> i.e., deficient, <b>body. And if it is so,</b> that a fetus with a mashed face does not render its mother impure, <b>let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach:</b> We are not concerned that <b>perhaps</b> it came <b>from</b> a fetus with <b>a sealed body or from one whose face is mashed.</b>
<b>Rav Pappi says: In</b> a case where <b>its face is mashed, everyone agrees that</b> the woman <b>is impure. When they disagree,</b> it is <b>in</b> a case where <b>its face is</b> completely <b>flat,</b> i.e., none of its features are discernible; <b>and the opposite was stated: Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>its mother is pure, and Reish Lakish says</b> that <b>its mother is impure.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> according to this version of the dispute, <b>let Reish Lakish raise an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan from this</b> <i>baraita</i>, from which Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to the opinion of Reish Lakish according to the previous version of the dispute: If a woman who discharges a fetus whose face is flat is pure, the <i>baraita</i> should have stated that there is no concern that the hand or foot might have come from a fetus with a sealed body or one whose face is flat. The Gemara answers: Reish Lakish did not raise the objection, <b>because Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> would have <b>responded to him</b> that the status of <b>a sealed body is</b> the same as that of <b>one whose face is flat.</b> There is no reason to mention both types of deformities.
The Gemara relates: <b>The sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya went out to the villages</b> to inspect their father’s fields. When <b>they came</b> back <b>to their father, he said to them:</b> Wasn’t <b>any incident brought to you</b> for a halakhic ruling? <b>They said to him:</b> A case of a woman who discharged a fetus with <b>a flat face was brought to us, and we deemed her impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after childbirth.
Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to them: Go out and deem pure that which you have deemed impure. What was your thinking</b> when you ruled that she is impure? Did you reason that as the matter is subject to a dispute, one should rule <b>stringently?</b> But your ruling <b>is a stringency that leads to a leniency, as you have given</b> the woman thirty-three <b>days of purity</b> after the birth of a male, following her period of impurity, which are the minimum days of purity established in the Torah for a woman who gave birth.
§ <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to a woman or female animal <b>who discharges an entity that has two backs and two spines, Rav says</b> that <b>in</b> the case of the <b>woman,</b> her discharged fetus <b>is not</b> considered <b>an offspring,</b> as it cannot survive, and therefore the woman does not have the ritual impurity caused by childbirth, and <b>in</b> the case of the <b>animal,</b> its fetus <b>is prohibited for consumption. And Shmuel says: In</b> the case of <b>a woman,</b> the discharged fetus is considered <b>an offspring,</b> and the woman is impure, and <b>in</b> the case of <b>an animal,</b> the fetus is <b>permitted for consumption.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do</b> Rav and Shmuel <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: They disagree <b>concerning</b> the statement <b>of Rav Ḥanin bar Abba, as Rav Ḥanin bar Abba said:</b> The verse states: “Nevertheless these you shall not eat of them that only chew the cud, or of them that only have the hoof cloven [<i>umimafrisei haparsa hashesua</i>]: The camel, and the hare, and the rock badger” (Deuteronomy 14:7). The apparently superfluous term <b><i>hashesua</i></b> is not a redundant description of the cloven hoof; it is referring to a separate <b>entity that has two backs and two spines</b> and therefore looks like an entirely cloven animal.
It is with regard to this prohibition that Rav and Shmuel disagree. <b>Rav says</b> that <b>there is no</b> such living <b>entity in the world, and when the Merciful One taught</b> this prohibition <b>to Moses, he taught</b> it <b>to</b> him with regard to a fetus that has two backs and two spines that is found <b>in the womb of its mother</b> after slaughter. <b>And Shmuel says</b> that <b>there is</b> such <b>an entity in the world, and when the Merciful One taught</b> this prohibition <b>to Moses, he taught</b> it <b>to him</b> with regard to a living animal <b>in the world, but</b> a fetus that has two backs and two spines <b>in the womb of its mother is permitted</b> for consumption.
<b>Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya raised an objection to Rav</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says: Any</b> priest <b>who has two backs and two spines is disqualified from</b> the Temple <b>service,</b> as he is blemished. <b>Evidently,</b> an entity <b>that</b> has two backs and two spines <b>can survive, and</b> this is <b>difficult for</b> the opinion of <b>Rav.</b> Rav <b>said to him: You are</b> clearly <b>Shimi,</b> i.e., you asked well. Yet the statement of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus is not referring to one who literally has two backs and two spines, but rather <b>to</b> one <b>whose spine is crooked</b> and therefore appears as though he has two spines. One who actually has two backs and two spines cannot survive.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: Among discharged animal <b>fetuses, there are those that are forbidden</b> in consumption, as they have the halakhic status of carcasses of unslaughtered animals. Specifically, if an animal fetus is <b>born</b> in the <b>fourth</b> month of pregnancy in the case <b>of small</b> domesticated animals, where the pregnancy is normally five months long, or it is <b>born</b> in the <b>eighth</b> month of pregnancy in the case <b>of large</b> livestock, where the pregnancy is normally nine months long, or if the miscarriage occurred <b>from this</b> stage of the pregnancy <b>and earlier,</b> i.e., if the pregnancy ended before this stage, the animal is <b>forbidden.</b> This <b>excludes one that has two backs and two spines.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean when it states that an animal with two backs and two spines is <b>excluded?</b> Does it <b>not</b> mean that it is <b>excluded from the category of</b> those <b>fetuses,</b> which are permitted for consumption if found inside their mother’s womb, <b>as</b> such animals are <b>forbidden even</b> while they are <b>in the wombs of their mothers?</b> This contradicts the opinion of Shmuel, who holds that an animal fetus of that type is permitted for consumption.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rav explains</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>according to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, and Shmuel explains</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>according to his</b> line of <b>reasoning. Rav explains</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>according to his</b> line of <b>reasoning,</b> as was assumed above: If an animal fetus is <b>born</b> in the <b>fourth</b> month of pregnancy in the case <b>of small</b> domesticated animals, or it is <b>born</b> in the <b>eighth</b> month of pregnancy in the case <b>of large</b> livestock, or if it was born <b>from this</b> stage of the pregnancy <b>and earlier,</b> the animal is <b>forbidden.</b>
<b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> In a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>emerged into the airspace of the world; but</b> if it was found <b>in its mother’s womb</b> after its mother was slaughtered, <b>it is permitted for</b> consumption. This <b>excludes</b> the case of a fetus <b>that has two backs and two spines, as even</b> if it is found <b>in the womb of its mother it is prohibited.</b>

Daf 24b

<b>And Shmuel explains</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>according to his</b> line of <b>reasoning,</b> in the following manner: If an animal fetus is <b>born</b> in the <b>fourth</b> month of pregnancy in the case <b>of small</b> domesticated animals, or it is <b>born</b> in the <b>eighth</b> month of pregnancy in the case <b>of large</b> livestock, or if it was born <b>from this</b> stage of the pregnancy <b>and earlier,</b> the animal is <b>forbidden. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> In a case <b>when</b> the fetus’s <b>months</b> of gestation <b>were not completed; but</b> in a case when <b>its months</b> of gestation <b>were completed, it is permitted</b> for consumption even outside the womb. This <b>excludes</b> a fetus <b>that has two backs and two spines, as even in</b> a case where <b>its months</b> of gestation <b>were completed, if it emerged into the airspace of the world, it is forbidden,</b> whereas if it is found <b>in the womb of its mother, it is permitted.</b>
<b>A <i>tanna</i> taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav:</b> In the case of a woman <b>who discharges an entity</b> that has <b>a shapeless body,</b> i.e., it does not have the outline of limbs, <b>or an entity</b> that has <b>a shapeless head,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>its mother should be impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “If a woman bears seed and gives birth to a male,</b> she shall be impure seven days; as in the days of the menstruation of her sickness she shall be impure. <b>And on the eighth day</b> the flesh of his foreskin <b>shall be circumcised”</b> (Leviticus 12:2–3).
Those verses teach that the impurity of a woman after childbirth applies only to one who gave birth to a child <b>that is fit for circumcision</b> on the <b>eighth</b> day, <b>excluding these</b> cases, <b>where</b> the child <b>is not fit for circumcision</b> on the <b>eighth</b> day, as it cannot survive that long. Consequently, this woman does not have the impurity of a woman after childbirth. <b>Rav said to</b> the <i>tanna</i>: <b>And conclude</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>like this:</b> Excluding these cases, where the child is not fit for circumcision on the eighth day, <b>and</b> excluding the case of a woman who discharges a child <b>that has two backs and two spines.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba thought to perform an action,</b> i.e., to issue a ruling, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel,</b> that a woman who gives birth to a child with two backs and two spines is impure. <b>Rav Huna said to him: What is your thinking?</b> That as this matter is subject to a dispute, one should rule <b>stringently?</b> Your ruling <b>is a stringency that leads to a leniency, as you have given</b> the woman a period of thirty-three days following her period of impurity when any blood that emerges is <b>blood of purity. In any event,</b> you should <b>perform,</b> i.e., issue your ruling, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav, as we maintain</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav with regard to ritual matters, whether</b> his opinion leads <b>to a leniency or to a stringency.</b>
§ <b>Rava says:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> that <b>a woman can give birth</b> to a viable offspring <b>after nine</b> months of pregnancy <b>or after seven</b> months of pregnancy; but if a woman gives birth after eight months of pregnancy, the child cannot survive and is stillborn. Similarly, <b>a large domesticated animal gives birth</b> to a viable offspring <b>after nine</b> months of pregnancy, and if it discharges a fetus after only eight months, the newborn animal cannot survive. With this in mind, Rava asked: Can a large domesticated animal <b>give birth</b> to a viable offspring <b>after seven</b> months of pregnancy, like a human, <b>or</b> can such an animal <b>not give birth</b> to a viable offspring after only seven months?
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma from the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>: If an animal discharges <b>from this</b> stage of the pregnancy <b>and earlier,</b> the fetus is <b>forbidden</b> in consumption as an unslaughtered animal carcass. <b>What, is it not</b> referring <b>to large</b> livestock, which indicates that large livestock do not give birth to a viable offspring after only seven months of pregnancy? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the reference is specifically <b>to small</b> domesticated animals, which do not give birth to a viable offspring until after five months of pregnancy.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this answer: <b>What is this? Granted, if you say</b> that the reference is <b>to large</b> livestock, it is <b>necessary</b> for the <i>baraita</i> to state that an animal does not give birth to a viable offspring after less than a complete period of pregnancy, as otherwise it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since in</b> the case of <b>a woman</b> who gives birth after seven months the baby <b>survives,</b> it is logical that <b>in</b> the case of a large domesticated <b>animal</b> that gives birth after seven months the newborn <b>also survives,</b> and it is therefore permitted for consumption. Consequently, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us that</b> such an animal <b>does not survive.</b>
<b>But if you say</b> that the ruling in the <i>baraita</i>, that if an animal discharged a fetus before the period of gestation was completed then the fetus is prohibited, <b>was stated with regard to small</b> domesticated animals, isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that if a sheep or goat fetus was discharged at this stage it cannot survive? <b>Can it survive after</b> only <b>three months</b> of gestation?
The Gemara answers that in fact <b>it is necessary</b> for the <i>baraita</i> to state this <i>halakha</i> with regard to small domesticated animals, as otherwise it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>any</b> mammal that is born <b>two months less</b> than its complete gestation <b>survives,</b> just as a human born at seven months of gestation survives. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that a sheep or goat that is born at three months of gestation cannot survive and is forbidden for consumption.
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> In the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> a fetus that has <b>the form of a lilith,</b> a female demon with wings and a human face, <b>its mother is impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth,</b> as <b>it is</b> a viable <b>offspring, only it has wings. This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei said: An incident</b> occurred <b>in Simoni involving a certain</b> woman <b>who discharged</b> a fetus that had <b>the form of a lilith, and</b> the <b>incident was brought before the Sages; and they said</b> that <b>it is</b> a viable <b>offspring, only it has wings.</b>
There was a case of a woman <b>who discharged</b> an item that had <b>the form of a snake. Ḥanina,</b> the <b>son of Rabbi Yehoshua’s brother, ruled</b> that <b>its mother is impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth. Rabbi Yosef went and told</b> this <b>matter to Rabban Gamliel.</b> Rabban Gamliel <b>sent to Rabbi Yehoshua: Take</b> hold of <b>your nephew and come</b> to me, so that I may admonish him for his ruling.
<b>While they were going</b> to Rabban Gamliel, <b>Ḥanina’s daughter-in-law went out to greet</b> Rabbi Yehoshua, and <b>said to him: My teacher, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a woman <b>who discharges</b> an item that looks <b>like a snake?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to her: Its mother is pure. She said to him: But my mother-in-law said to me in your name</b> that <b>its mother is impure</b> in such a case, <b>and</b> that you <b>said to her: For what reason</b> is she impure? It is <b>because the pupil of</b> a snake <b>is round like that of a human. Due to her statement, Rabbi Yehoshua remembered</b> that he had issued such a ruling. He subsequently <b>sent</b> a message <b>to Rabban Gamliel: Ḥanina issued the ruling based on my</b> own statement.
<b>Abaye said: Conclude from</b> this incident that <b>a Torah scholar [<i>tzurva merabbanan</i>] who says</b> a halakhic <b>matter should say the reason</b> for his statement, <b>so that when</b> his colleagues <b>remind him</b> of his reasoning, <b>he will remember</b> that ruling, as happened to Rabbi Yehoshua.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A woman <b>who discharges a gestational sac full of fluid, full of blood,</b> or <b>full of</b> different <b>colors</b> need <b>not be concerned that</b> it was <b>an offspring. But if</b> the sac <b>was</b> one in which <b>tissue developed,</b> her halakhic status is that of a woman after childbirth. Since the sex of the embryo is unknown, the woman <b>observes</b> the strictures of a woman who gave birth both <b>to a male and to a female;</b> she is impure for fourteen days like a woman who gave birth to a female, but blood that she sees thereafter is pure only until forty days after birth, like a woman who gave birth to a male. A woman <b>who discharges a sandal</b> fetus, i.e., one that has the form of a sandal fish, <b>and</b> one who discharges <b>an afterbirth observes</b> the strictures of a woman who gave birth both <b>to a male and to a female.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Granted,</b> one can understand why a woman who discharges a gestational sac full of <b>blood or water</b> is pure, as such an item <b>is nothing,</b> i.e., it is not an offspring. <b>But</b> if the gestational sac was full of different <b>colors, let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps it was an offspring and</b> it <b>liquefied. Abaye says</b> in response: <b>How much undiluted wine,</b> which can be harmful to an embryo, <b>did the mother of this</b> purported embryo <b>drink, that her embryo was liquefied in her womb?</b> In other words, there is no such concern.
<b>Rava says</b> that there is a different explanation: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that the gestational sac was <b>full</b> of different colors, <b>and if it is so,</b> that there was an embryo in the sac <b>that liquefied,</b> the sac would have been <b>lacking</b> some of the mass of the liquified portion. <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava says</b> that there is yet another explanation: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that the gestational sac is full of different <b>colors, and if it is so,</b> that there was an embryo there <b>that liquefied, it would all be of one color.</b>
With regard to the effect of drinking wine on a person’s body, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Abba Shaul says: I used to be a gravedigger, and I would observe the bones of corpses.</b> I discovered that <b>the bones of one who drinks</b> too much <b>undiluted wine</b> during his lifetime look <b>burnt, the bones of</b> one who drinks too much <b>diluted</b> wine <b>are black,</b> and <b>the bones of</b> one who drinks the <b>appropriate</b> amount of wine <b>are fat,</b> i.e., full of marrow. <b>And</b> furthermore, I discovered that <b>the bones of anyone who drinks</b> much <b>more than he eats</b> look <b>burnt, the bones of</b> one who <b>eats</b> much <b>more than he drinks are black,</b> and <b>the bones of one who</b> eats and drinks <b>appropriate</b> amounts <b>are fat.</b>
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Abba Shaul says</b> the following, <b>and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> said it: <b>I used to be a gravedigger. Once I ran after a deer, and I entered the thighbone of a corpse; and</b> it was so large that <b>I ran after</b> the deer for <b>three parasangs</b> inside the thighbone, <b>and</b> although <b>I did not reach</b> the <b>deer,</b> the <b>thighbone did not end. When I came back</b> and related this to the Sages, <b>they said to me: It was</b> evidently the thighbone <b>of Og, king of Bashan,</b> a known giant.
<b>It is</b> likewise <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Abba Shaul says: I used to be a gravedigger. Once</b> a burial <b>cave opened up underneath</b> where I was standing, <b>and I</b> found myself <b>standing in the eye socket of a corpse until my nose. When I came back</b> and told this to the Sages, <b>they said to me: It was</b> evidently <b>the eye of Absalom.</b>
<b>And lest you say</b> that <b>Abba Shaul was a midget,</b> and therefore he was capable of standing in an eye socket until his nose, <b>Abba Shaul was the tallest</b> person <b>in his generation. And Rabbi Tarfon reached</b> only <b>his shoulder, and Rabbi Tarfon was the tallest</b> person <b>in his generation. And Rabbi Meir reached</b> only <b>the shoulder of</b> Rabbi Tarfon, and <b>Rabbi Meir was the tallest</b> person <b>in his generation. And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>reached</b> only <b>the shoulder of</b> Rabbi Meir, and <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>was the tallest</b> person <b>in his generation.</b>
The Gemara continues: <b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya reached</b> only <b>the shoulder of</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and Rabbi Ḥiyya was the tallest</b> person <b>in his generation. And Rav reached</b> only <b>the shoulder of</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya, and <b>Rav was the tallest</b> person <b>in his generation. And Rav Yehuda reached</b> only <b>the shoulder of</b> Rav, <b>and Rav Yehuda was the tallest</b> person <b>in his generation. And Adda the attendant [<i>dayyala</i>] reached</b> only <b>the shoulder of</b> Rav Yehuda,

Daf 25a

and when <b>the governor [<i>parashtevina</i>] of Pumbedita would stand</b> next <b>to Adda the attendant,</b> he would reach only <b>half of his</b> height. <b>And</b> when <b>everyone</b> else <b>in the world would stand</b> next <b>to the governor of Pumbedita,</b> they would reach only <b>his loins [<i>ḥartzeih</i>].</b>
§ The students <b>asked Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: In the case of a woman <b>who discharges a gestational sac full of flesh, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does she have the impurity of a woman after childbirth? Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to them: I have not heard</b> from my teachers the <i>halakha</i> in this case.
<b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, said to him: This</b> is what <b>my father,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥalafta, one of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s teachers, <b>said:</b> If a woman discharged a gestational sac <b>full of blood, she is impure</b> with the impurity of <b>a menstruating woman.</b> If it is <b>full of flesh, she is impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth.</b>
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: If you had told us</b> an entirely <b>new statement in the name of your father,</b> no part of which was also stated by another Sage, <b>we would have listened to you,</b> i.e., we would have accepted the statement as <i>halakha</i>. But <b>now</b> that you stated two <i>halakhot</i>, one with regard to a woman who discharged a gestational sac full of blood, and the other with regard to a woman who discharged a gestational sac full of flesh, the entire statement cannot be accepted as <i>halakha</i>.
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi explains: <b>From</b> the fact that Rabbi Yosei <b>said this first clause</b> of his statement, with regard to a gestational sac full of blood, <b>in accordance with an individual</b> opinion, i.e., <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Sumakhos, who said in the name of Rabbi Meir</b> that the woman is impure, contrary to the opinion of the other Sages, it follows that with regard to <b>this</b> latter statement <b>as well,</b> with regard to a gestational sac full of flesh, one can say that <b>perhaps</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>said it in accordance with</b> the opinion of another individual Sage, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua. And</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a woman <b>who discharges a gestational sac in which tissue did not develop, Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> It has the status of <b>an offspring,</b> and the woman has the impurity of a woman after childbirth; <b>and the Rabbis say: It is not an offspring,</b> and the woman is pure. The opinion of Rabbi Yosei that a woman who discharged a gestational sac full of flesh is impure might be in accordance with the ruling of Rabbi Yehoshua, which is not accepted as <i>halakha</i>, since the majority of the other Sages disagree with him. Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> cannot be decided in accordance with either part of the statement of Rabbi Yosei.
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says in the name of Rabbi Oshaya:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehoshua and the Rabbis applies <b>in</b> a case where the amniotic fluid is <b>turbid,</b> as Rabbi Yehoshua holds that the turbidity indicates that there was likely an embryo in the sac that liquefied. <b>But in</b> a case where the amniotic fluid is <b>clear, everyone agrees</b> that the discharged sac <b>is not</b> considered <b>an offspring. And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> applies <b>in</b> a case where the amniotic fluid is <b>clear.</b>
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: What does Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi mean? Does he mean that the <b>dispute</b> applies only <b>in</b> a case where the amniotic fluid is <b>clear, but in</b> a case where it is <b>turbid, everyone agrees</b> that it has the halakhic status of <b>an offspring? Or perhaps</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi means that the <b>dispute</b> applies <b>in this</b> case <b>and in that</b> case, i.e., the Rabbis hold that the sac does not have the status of an offspring even if the amniotic fluid is turbid. The Gemara concludes that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion that the dispute between Rabbi Yehoshua and the Rabbis applies only in a case where the amniotic fluid is turbid. It is taught in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya,</b> who is the same Rabbi Yehoshua who disagrees with the Rabbis with regard to the case of a woman who discharges a gestational sac in which tissue did not develop, <b>taught this</b> following proof for his opinion that the woman is impure: It is stated: <b>“And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins, and clothed them”</b> (Genesis 3:21). This <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not make skin for a person unless he is</b> already <b>created,</b> as God first created Adam and Eve, and then gave them skin. Consequently, the existence of a gestational sac proves that there is an offspring.
<b>Evidently,</b> according to Rabbi Yehoshua <b>the matter</b> of whether or not an embryo is considered offspring <b>is dependent on</b> whether or not there is <b>skin,</b> and there <b>is no difference</b> whether the amniotic fluid is <b>turbid, and</b> there <b>is no difference</b> whether it is <b>clear.</b>
<b>Granted, if you say</b> that the <b>dispute</b> applies <b>in</b> a case where it is <b>clear, that is</b> why it <b>was necessary</b> for Rabbi Yehoshua to derive from <b>a verse</b> that an embryo that has skin is considered an offspring. <b>But if you say</b> that the <b>dispute</b> applies <b>in</b> a case where the amniotic fluid is <b>turbid,</b> but Rabbi Yehoshua concedes that the woman is pure if it is clear, <b>why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> to teach that if the amniotic fluid is turbid the woman is impure? <b>It is logical</b> that where the amniotic fluid is turbid there was probably an embryo that liquefied. <b>Rather, conclude from it</b> that the <b>dispute</b> applies <b>in</b> a case where the amniotic fluid is <b>clear.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>Conclude from it</b> that this is correct.
<b>And likewise,</b> just as Rabbi Oshaya interprets the dispute between Rabbi Yehoshua and the Rabbis as referring to a case where the amniotic fluid is turbid, <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehoshua and the Rabbis applies <b>in</b> a case where the amniotic fluid is <b>turbid; but in</b> a case where the amniotic fluid is <b>clear, everyone agrees</b> that the discharged sac <b>is not</b> considered <b>an offspring.</b>
<b>Rava raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> from a mishna that specifies the obligations that apply to firstborn animals (<i>Bekhorot</i> 19b):<b>But</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that not only does a viable offspring exempt any subsequent offspring from being counted a firstborn, but the same applies to <b>an indication of the offspring</b> that is discharged from the womb. The indication <b>in a small animal</b> is a <b>murky discharge</b> from the womb, <b>in a large</b> animal it is the emergence of <b>an afterbirth,</b> and <b>in a woman</b> the indication is <b>a gestational sac or an afterbirth.</b>
Rava infers: <b>And yet</b> the miscarriage of <b>a gestational sac in</b> the case of a large <b>animal does not exempt</b> the animal’s subsequent offspring from being counted a firstborn. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehoshua and the Rabbis applies <b>in</b> a case where the amniotic fluid is <b>clear,</b> it is <b>due to that</b> reason that the mishna differentiates between a large animal and a woman with regard to a gestational sac.
Rava explains: <b>With regard to a woman, as the</b> aforementioned <b>verse:</b> “And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins,” <b>includes</b> in the definition of offspring a gestational sac, i.e., skin, one can say that such <b>a gestational sac exempts</b> subsequent births from the obligations of primogeniture. By contrast, <b>in</b> the case of <b>an animal, as the verse does not include</b> a gestational sac in the definition of offspring, discharging <b>a gestational sac does not exempt</b> the animal’s subsequent offspring from being considered a firstborn.
<b>But if you say</b> that the <b>dispute</b> applies <b>in</b> a case where the amniotic fluid is <b>turbid,</b> and Rabbi Yehoshua deems the woman impure due to the likelihood that there was an embryo that liquefied, <b>since</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> based on <b>logic, what is different</b> in the case of <b>a woman, and what is different</b> in the case of <b>an animal?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua’s reasoning applies equally to both. Evidently, the dispute applies in a case where the amniotic fluid is clear.
The Gemara answers: <b>Do you hold</b> that <b>it is obvious to Rabbi Yehoshua</b> that a gestational sac in which the amniotic fluid is turbid has the halakhic status of an offspring? That is not so; rather, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua is uncertain</b> of its halakhic status, <b>and</b> therefore <b>here,</b> in this case, he rules <b>stringently, and there</b> he also rules <b>stringently.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: First of all, <b>with regard to</b> a situation where <b>a woman</b> discharged a gestational sac in which the amniotic fluid was turbid, in <b>which</b> case the obligation of primogeniture <b>is a monetary matter,</b> i.e., the obligation to redeem the newborn child by paying money to a priest, the subsequent births are exempt, in accordance with the principle that <b>uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>monetary matters</b> is treated <b>leniently.</b>
By contrast, <b>with regard to an animal,</b> in <b>which</b> case firstborn status <b>is a ritual matter, as there are</b> prohibitions <b>involving,</b> i.e., against, <b>shearing</b> the animal’s wool <b>and</b> using the animal for <b>labor</b> before it incurs a blemish, the discharged gestational sac is not considered an offspring and does not exempt subsequent births from the obligations of firstborn status, as <b>uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>ritual matters</b> is treated <b>stringently. So too, with regard to</b> the impurity of <b>a woman</b> who discharged a gestational sac, she is deemed impure, as <b>uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>impurity</b> is treated <b>stringently,</b> which means that for the purposes of this <i>halakha</i> a gestational sac is considered an offspring.
The Gemara asks: <b>And is</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>uncertain</b> about the <i>halakha</i> of a woman who discharges a gestational sac? <b>But doesn’t he cite a verse</b> as proof that the woman has the impurity of one who gave birth? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehoshua maintains that the woman is impure <b>by rabbinic</b> law, <b>and the verse</b> he cites <b>is a mere support</b> for this <i>halakha</i>; it is not the actual source.
<b>Rav Ḥanina bar Shelamya said to Rav: This</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who told his students that he did not hear from his teachers the <i>halakha</i> in the case of a woman who discharged a gestational sac full of flesh; and <b>this</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei,</b> who cited his father’s opinion that in such a case the woman is impure. <b>And this</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Oshaya,</b> that the dispute between Rabbi Yehoshua and the Rabbis applies only in a case where the amniotic fluid is turbid; <b>and</b> finally <b>this</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi,</b> who holds that the dispute applies if the amniotic fluid is clear. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>does the Master hold?</b>
Rav <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥanina bar Shelamya: <b>I say</b> that <b>both</b> in <b>this</b> case, where the amniotic fluid is turbid, <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, where the fluid is clear, the woman does <b>not</b> need to be <b>concerned</b> that she has the status of a woman who gave birth to an offspring.
<b>And Shmuel says:</b> In <b>both this</b> case <b>and that</b> case, the woman must be <b>concerned</b> that the discharged gestational sac has the status of an offspring, and therefore she is considered impure like a woman who gave birth. <b>And Shmuel follows his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning</b> here, <b>as when Rav Dimi came</b> and transmitted many halakhic traditions, the latter <b>said: In Neharde’a</b> the Sages <b>never deemed</b> a woman who discharged <b>a gestational sac pure, except for</b> the case of <b>a certain gestational sac that came before Shmuel, who placed a hair on this side</b> of that sac, <b>and it was visible from that side.</b> Shmuel <b>said,</b> based on this test: <b>If it were so, that</b> there <b>was an offspring</b> in the sac, <b>it would not have been so transparent.</b> He therefore deemed the woman pure, but his ruling applied only in that extreme case.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>But if</b> the sac <b>was</b> one in which <b>tissue developed,</b> the halakhic status of the woman is that of a woman after childbirth. Since the sex of the embryo is unknown, she observes the strictures of a woman who gave birth both to a male and to a female; she is impure for fourteen days like a woman who gave birth to a female, but blood that she sees thereafter is pure only until forty days after birth, like a woman who gave birth to a male. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is</b> the definition of <b>a gestational sac</b> in which <b>tissue developed? Abba Shaul says: The beginning of the formation of</b> the embryo <b>is from its head, and its two eyes</b> look <b>like two drops,</b> similar to the eyes <b>of a fly. Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches:</b> These eyes must be <b>distant from each other.</b> Furthermore, <b>its two nostrils</b> look <b>like two drops,</b> similar to the nostrils <b>of a fly.</b>
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches: And</b> these eyes must be <b>close to each other. And its mouth stretches</b> along the width of its face <b>like a strand of hair. And its body is like</b> the size of <b>a lentil. And if it was female,</b> its vagina can be <b>discerned</b> by the appearance <b>of</b> a line like a cracked grain of <b>barley</b> oriented <b>along the length of</b> its body.
<b>And it does not have the shape of arms and legs</b> at this stage. <b>And it is said with regard to</b> an embryo at this stage, <b>in</b> the texts of <b>tradition,</b> the Prophets: <b>“Have You not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese? You have clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews. You have granted me life and favor, and Your providence has preserved my spirit”</b> (Job 10:10–12).
<b>And one does not examine it with water</b> to discover its sex, <b>as water is</b> too <b>strong,</b>

Daf 25b

<b>and dissolves it. Rather, one examines it with oil, as oil is soft and cleans</b> the embryo so that its sex can be discerned. <b>And one views</b> it <b>only in</b> the light of <b>the sun.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>How does one examine</b> the embryo? The Gemara expresses surprise at this question: <b>How does one examine it</b> to determine whether it has the halakhic status of an offspring? Clearly, one examines it <b>as we</b> just <b>said. Rather,</b> the question is as follows: <b>In what</b> manner <b>does one examine it to ascertain whether it is male or</b> whether <b>it is female?</b>
<b>Abba Shaul bar Nash, and some say Abba Shaul bar Remash, says: One brings a sliver of wood whose top is smooth, and he moves</b> it along the embryo <b>in that place,</b> i.e., the sex organ. <b>If</b> the sliver <b>is caught,</b> i.e., its movement is not smooth, <b>it is known that</b> the embryo <b>is male,</b> as its member interfered with the movement of the sliver. <b>And if</b> the sliver is <b>not</b> caught, <b>it is known that it is female.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that if the movement of the sliver is not smooth then the embryo is male, <b>only</b> if the sliver was moved along the sex organ of the embryo <b>from below to above; but</b> if it was moved <b>from the sides,</b> from one side to the other, the fact that it was not smooth does not prove that the embryo is male, as one can <b>say</b> that <b>the sides of the womb</b> interfered.
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava says:</b> The complete version of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>taught</b> as follows: <b>If it was female,</b> its vagina can be <b>discerned</b> by the appearance <b>of</b> a line like <b>a cracked</b> grain of <b>barley</b> oriented along the length of its body. <b>Rav Naḥman objects to this: But perhaps it is</b> not the vagina but <b>the recess between the testes,</b> and the embryo is male. <b>Abaye said</b> to him: <b>Now,</b> at this stage of development, <b>the testes</b> of the embryo <b>themselves are not discernible.</b> Is it possible that <b>the recess between the testes is discernible?</b>
The <i>baraita</i> teaches that at this stage an embryo does not have the shape of arms and legs. <b>Rabbi Amram says</b> that <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that when an embryo’s arms and legs start to take shape, <b>its two thighs</b> look <b>like two strings of crimson</b> thread <b>[<i>zehorit</i>]. And Rabbi Amram says with regard to</b> this matter that the thighs look <b>like</b> two strings <b>of the woof,</b> which are thicker than those of the warp. The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And its two arms</b> look <b>like two strings of crimson</b> thread<b>. And Rabbi Amram says with regard to</b> this matter that the arms look <b>like</b> two strings <b>of the warp.</b>
<b>Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda: <i>Shinnana</i>, do not perform an action,</b> i.e., do not issue a practical ruling deeming a woman who discharges an embryo at this stage of development impure, <b>unless</b> the embryo <b>has grown hair.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And did Shmuel</b> actually <b>say that? But doesn’t Shmuel say</b> with regard to a woman who discharged a gestational sac that <b>both</b> in <b>this</b> case, where the amniotic fluid is turbid, <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, where the fluid is clear, the woman must be <b>concerned</b> that the discharged gestational sac might have the status of an offspring, which would mean that she is impure even without the growth of hair on the embryo?
<b>Rav Ami bar Shmuel says:</b> This matter was <b>explained to me by Mar Shmuel:</b> As for <b>being concerned</b> that perhaps she is impure, the woman must be <b>concerned,</b> due to the uncertainty whether she discharged an offspring. But <b>we do not give her</b> the <b>days of purity</b> that follow the period of impurity for a woman who gave birth, <b>unless</b> the embryo <b>has grown hair.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that Shmuel is uncertain</b> whether a gestational sac has the halakhic status of an offspring? <b>But</b> there was an incident involving <b>a certain gestational sac that was brought before Mar Shmuel,</b> and Shmuel <b>said: This</b> embryo <b>is forty-one days old. And</b> Shmuel subsequently <b>calculated</b> the amount of time that had passed <b>from the day that</b> the woman <b>went to</b> perform <b>immersion</b> in a ritual bath <b>until that day, and it was only forty days.</b>
<b>And he said to</b> the local court: <b>This</b> husband <b>engaged in intercourse with</b> his wife when she was <b>a menstruating woman. They bound</b> the husband <b>and he confessed.</b> Since Shmuel was so proficient in embryology, why was he unsure about the halakhic status of a gestational sac? The Gemara answers: <b>Shmuel</b> himself <b>is different, as his strength,</b> i.e., his proficiency, was <b>great.</b> His general ruling that the halakhic status of a gestational sac is uncertain applies to people who are not as proficient as he is.
§ The mishna teaches that a woman <b>who discharges a sandal</b> fetus or one who discharges an afterbirth observes the strictures of a woman who gave birth both to a male and to a female. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A sandal</b> fetus has <b>a similar</b> appearance <b>to</b> a certain <b>fish of</b> the <b>sea</b> known as a sandal fish;it looks as though <b>it is</b> a full-fledged <b>offspring from the outset, but it was mashed. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: A sandal</b> fetus has an appearance that is <b>similar to the tongue of the large bull.</b> Students <b>testified in the name of our teachers</b> that for <b>a sandal</b> fetus to have the halakhic status of an offspring, it <b>requires the shape of a face.</b>
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>a sandal</b> fetus <b>requires the shape of a face</b> for it to have the status of an offspring. <b>Rav Adda says</b> that <b>Rav Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: A sandal</b> fetus <b>requires the shape of a face, but</b> the face does not need to be in its proper location; <b>even</b> if the face is <b>on the back of its</b> head, the fetus has the status of an offspring. <b>A parable to</b> which this situation can be compared is that of <b>a person who slapped another</b> in the face <b>and pushed his face back.</b> Here too, the face of the sandal fetus was pushed back due to external pressure.
The Gemara relates: <b>In the days of Rabbi Yannai,</b> the other Sages <b>wished to deem pure</b> a woman who discharges <b>a sandal</b> fetus <b>that does not have the shape of a face. Rabbi Yannai said to them: You have deemed pure</b> women who discharge <b>offspring.</b> Rabbi Yannai holds that even a sandal fetus that does not have the shape of a face is considered an offspring.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that students <b>testified in the name of our teachers</b> that for <b>a sandal</b> fetus to have the halakhic status of an offspring it <b>requires the shape of a face? Rav Beivai bar Abaye says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> in response: <b>This mishna,</b> i.e., the ruling to which the students testified, <b>is taught from the testimony of Rabbi Neḥunya.</b> In other words, this ruling is the opinion of an individual <i>tanna</i>, which is not accepted. <b>Rabbi Zeira says: Rav Beivai merited that his</b> ruling of <b><i>halakha</i>,</b> which he transmitted in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan, was accepted. <b>As he and I were</b> both <b>sitting before Rabbi Yoḥanan when</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said this <i>halakha</i>, but</b> Rav Beivai <b>said it first</b> to the other Sages, <b>and</b> thereby <b>merited</b> that <b>it</b> was ascribed to him.
§ The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> does the mishna <b>mention</b> that if a woman discharged <b>a sandal</b> fetus she observes the strictures of a woman who gave birth both to a male and to a female? Since <b>there is no</b> such thing as <b>a sandal</b> fetus <b>that</b> does <b>not</b> have another <b>offspring with it,</b> which mashed it and gave it the form of a sandal fish, in any case the woman has the impurity of a woman after childbirth.
The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it is <b>a female</b> offspring that <b>is born with</b> the sandal fetus, it is <b>indeed</b> unnecessary to mention the <i>halakha</i> of the sandal fetus, as the woman is in any case impure for two weeks. But <b>here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where a male is born with it,</b> on account of which the woman would be impure for only seven days were it not for the sandal fetus.
In this case, it is necessary for the mishna to state that the woman observes the strictures of one who gave birth both to a male and to a female, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>since Rav Yitzḥak bar Ami says</b> that the sex of a fetus is determined at the moment of conception, as, if the <b>woman emits seed first she gives birth to a male</b> and if the <b>man emits seed first she gives birth to a female,</b> therefore, it can be concluded <b>from</b> the fact <b>that this</b> offspring that was born with the sandal fetus <b>is male,</b> that <b>this</b> sandal fetus <b>is also male.</b>
Lest this reasoning be accepted, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the woman must observe the strictures of a woman who gave birth to a female as well. This is because one can <b>say</b> that perhaps <b>both</b> the man and the woman <b>emitted seed at the same time,</b> and consequently <b>this</b> offspring <b>is male and that</b> sandal fetus <b>is female.</b>
<b>Alternatively,</b> it can be suggested that it is necessary for the mishna to state this <i>halakha</i> even with regard to a case where the twin of the sandal fetus is female, <b>as, if</b> the woman <b>gives birth to</b> the <b>female before sunset and</b> gives birth to the <b>sandal</b> fetus <b>after sunset,</b> which is considered the next day, the sex of the sandal fetus affects the count of the woman’s periods of impurity and purity.
If the sandal fetus is male, the woman’s status as a woman after childbirth ends after the eightieth day from the birth of the female offspring, and <b>she counts the beginning of</b> the period when seeing blood renders her impure as <b>a menstruating woman from</b> the birth of <b>the first</b> offspring, i.e., the female. <b>But</b> if the sandal fetus is female, the woman has the status of a woman after childbirth until after the eightieth day from its birth, which is the eighty-first day from the birth of the first offspring. If so, she counts <b>the beginning of</b> the period when seeing blood renders her impure as <b>a menstruating woman from</b> the birth of <b>the last</b> offspring, i.e., the sandal fetus.
The Gemara discusses why the case of a woman who discharged a sandal fetus is mentioned in other <i>mishnayot</i>, given that a sandal fetus always has a twin. First the Gemara discusses the <i>halakha</i> of a woman who discharged <b>a sandal</b> fetus <b>that we learned</b> in a mishna

Daf 26a

<b>with regard to firstborns</b> (<i>Bekhorot</i> 46a), which states that the son who is born after a sandal fetus has the status of a firstborn with regard to inheritance but not with regard to the obligation of redemption from a priest. The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> matter is that <b><i>halakha</i></b> relevant? Since the sandal fetus has a twin that is born with it, the subsequent son is in any case exempt from redemption.
The Gemara answers: That <i>halakha</i> is relevant <b>for</b> a case where the sandal fetus’s twin <b>comes</b> out of the womb <b>after it.</b> The mishna teaches that as the sandal fetus was born first, its twin is considered <b>a firstborn with regard to inheritance, but</b> it is <b>not a firstborn with regard to</b> redemption from <b>a priest.</b>
The Gemara discusses the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a woman who discharged <b>a sandal</b> fetus <b>that we learned</b> in a mishna <b>in</b> tractate <b><i>Karetot</i></b> (7b), which states that such a woman brings the offering of a woman who gave birth. The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> matter is that <b><i>halakha</i></b> relevant? In any case that woman is obligated to bring the offering of a woman who gave birth, due to the twin.
The Gemara answers: It is necessary for the mishna to state <b>that if</b> a woman <b>gives birth to</b> a full-fledged <b>offspring by means of caesarean section, and</b> to <b>a sandal</b> fetus in a regular manner <b>through</b> the <b>womb, in</b> such a case <b>she brings an offering for</b> giving birth to the <b>sandal</b> fetus, despite the fact that she does not bring an offering for the full-fledged offspring, as one does not bring an offering for a birth by caesarean section.
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to Rabbi Shimon, who said</b> that an offspring which is <b>delivered by means of caesarean section is</b> considered <b>a full-fledged offspring,</b> and its mother does bring an offering, <b>what is there to say?</b> Why is it necessary for the mishna to state this <i>halakha</i> if the woman must bring an offering regardless of the sandal fetus?
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya says:</b> It is necessary for the mishna to state <b>that if</b> a woman <b>gives birth to</b> the full-fledged <b>offspring while she is a gentile,</b> when the <i>halakhot</i> of a woman after childbirth do not apply to her, and she immediately converts to Judaism <b>and</b> gives birth to the <b>sandal</b> fetus <b>after she converted</b> and became obligated to observe the <i>halakhot</i> of a woman after childbirth, <b>that she brings an offering for the sandal</b> fetus.
<b>The Sages said</b> the answers to these questions <b>before Rav Pappa, and</b> they asked him: <b>And are these answers</b> correct? Can it be suggested that the sandal fetus was born before or after the twin fetus? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>when</b> a sandal fetus and the full-fledged offspring <b>exit</b> the womb, <b>they exit only wrapped</b> around one another?
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> in response: <b>Conclude from it</b> that the sandal fetus and its twin do not lie side by side, but rather the full-fledged <b>offspring encounters the sandal</b> fetus <b>at half its</b> height, i.e., the head of the full-fledged offspring presses into the abdomen of the sandal fetus. <b>And</b> when they are born, the full-fledged offspring <b>pushes</b> the sandal fetus <b>toward</b> the direction <b>its head</b> is pointing, to the entrance of the womb, causing the sandal fetus to be born first. Therefore, the mishna <b>with regard to firstborns</b> can be explained as referring to a case <b>where</b> the fetuses <b>exited</b> the womb <b>with their heads</b> first, <b>as</b> in such a case the <b>sandal</b> fetus <b>emerges first.</b> By contrast, the mishna <b>in</b> tractate <b><i>Karetot</i></b> is referring to a case <b>where they emerged with their feet</b> first, <b>as</b> in such a case the full-fledged <b>offspring emerges first.</b>
<b>Rav Huna bar Taḥlifa says in the name of Rava: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the two fetuses lie <b>precisely</b> side by side, <b>and</b> you should <b>reverse</b> Rav Pappa’s <b><i>halakha</i></b> so that it reads as follows: <b>With regard to firstborns,</b> the reference is to a case <b>where</b> the fetuses <b>emerged with their feet</b> first. In such a case, the full-fledged <b>offspring, which has life, hangs on and does not emerge</b> so quickly, whereas the <b>sandal</b> fetus, <b>which does not have life, slides</b> out <b>and emerges</b> first. <b>In</b> tractate <b><i>Karetot</i>,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the fetuses <b>came out with their heads</b> first. In such an instance, with regard to the full-fledged <b>offspring, which has life, once its head emerges it is</b> considered <b>a birth,</b> whereas the <b>sandal</b> fetus is considered to have been born <b>only when the majority of its</b> body <b>emerges.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If there is <b>an afterbirth in the house, the house is ritually impure,</b> in the sense that everything under the roof contracts impurity imparted by a corpse. The reason is <b>not that</b> the status of <b>an afterbirth</b> is that of <b>an offspring; rather,</b> it is <b>that there is no afterbirth without an offspring.</b> It is clear that the afterbirth contained an offspring that disintegrated after the miscarriage. That offspring rendered the contents of the house impure.
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The house does not become a tent over a corpse, as although there had been an offspring in the afterbirth, <b>the offspring disintegrated,</b> turning to blood, <b>before it emerged</b> from the womb, and it was negated by the majority of blood that accompanied the miscarriage.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the appearance of the afterbirth: At <b>the outset of</b> the pregnancy, the <b>afterbirth</b> is so thin that it is <b>similar to a string of the woof, and</b> at the <b>end of</b> the pregnancy it is much wider, <b>similar</b> in width <b>to a lupine. And</b> the afterbirth is <b>hollow like a trumpet, and there is no afterbirth</b> whose length is <b>less than a handbreadth. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says: An afterbirth is similar to the craw of roosters, from which the small</b> intestine <b>emerges.</b>
Since the <i>baraita</i> states that the minimum length of an afterbirth is a handbreadth, the Gemara cites another <i>baraita</i> that lists different items whose halakhic status is dependent on a minimum measure of a handbreadth. <b>It is taught</b> by <b>Rabbi Oshaya, the youngest [<i>ze’eira</i>] of the company [<i>demin ḥavrayya</i>]</b> of Sages: There are <b>five</b> items <b>whose</b> minimum <b>measure</b> is one <b>handbreadth, and these are they: An afterbirth,</b> the <b>shofar</b> for blowing on Rosh HaShana, the <b>spine</b> of a <i>lulav</i> that must be taken on <i>Sukkot</i>, the width of <b>the wall of a <i>sukka</i>, and the hyssop [<i>veha’ezov</i>].</b> Hyssop is used for the purification of a leper and for the preparation of the ashes of a red heifer in order to sprinkle them with water on someone who is ritually impure due to impurity imparted by a corpse.
The Gemara elaborates: The <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>an afterbirth is that which we stated</b> above. The <i>halakha</i> of <b>a shofar</b> is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How much is the measure</b> of the length <b>of a shofar</b> for blowing on Rosh HaShana? <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel explained:</b> It must be long <b>enough that when one holds it in his hand</b> with four fingers, <b>it can be seen</b> protruding <b>on one side</b> of his hand <b>and on the other side,</b> i.e., at least one <b>handbreadth.</b>
<b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a spine</b> of a <i>lulav</i>? It is <b>as Rabbi Parnakh said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The spine of a <i>lulav</i> must protrude</b> at least one <b>handbreadth beyond the myrtle branch</b> that is tied together with it. The <i>halakha</i> of <b>the wall of a <i>sukka</i></b> is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A <i>sukka</i> is valid only if it has <b>two</b> full-fledged partitions <b>in the standard sense,</b> completely closing each of those two sides and measuring at least seven handbreadths, <b>and a third</b> wall that measures <b>even</b> one <b>handbreadth.</b> If the third wall is less than a handbreadth long, the <i>sukka</i> is unfit. Finally, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>hyssop</b> is stated in a <i>baraita</i> <b>that Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches:</b> The <b>hyssop</b> used for the purification of a leper and for the preparation of the ashes of a red heifer must measure at least one <b>handbreadth.</b>
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa says</b> that <b>Sheila of Kefar Temarta taught</b> as a mnemonic: There are <b>three <i>baraitot</i>,</b> with regard to an afterbirth, a shofar, and the wall of a <i>sukka</i>, <b>and</b> there are <b>two</b> independent <b><i>halakhot</i></b> of <i>amora’im</i>, of the spine of a <i>lulav</i> and the hyssop, where the minimum <b>measure</b> of one <b>handbreadth</b> is required. The Gemara asks: Are there <b>two</b> <i>halakhot</i> of <i>amora’im</i> in this list? There <b>is</b> only <b>one</b> statement, with regard to the spine of a <i>lulav</i>. The <i>halakha</i> of the hyssop is taught in a <i>baraita</i> by Rabbi Ḥiyya. <b>Abaye says:</b> Revise the wording of that statement, so that it should not read that Rabbi Ḥiyya taught a <i>baraita</i>; rather, <b>say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya says</b> himself that the <b>hyssop</b> must measure at least one <b>handbreadth,</b> i.e., that <i>halakha</i> is not taught in a <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>And are there no more</b> cases where the minimum measure is one handbreadth, other than those five listed by Rabbi Oshaya? <b>But isn’t there</b> the following mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 3:7) that deals with the minimum size of a tent that transmits ritual impurity: <b>A cubic</b> space measuring one <b>handbreadth by</b> one <b>handbreadth with a height of</b> one <b>handbreadth transmits ritual impurity.</b> If a corpse is in that space, the impurity is transmitted to all people, vessels, and food in that space. <b>And</b> a space of that size <b>serves as a barrier before,</b> i.e., stops the spread of, <b>ritual impurity</b> beyond that space.
The Gemara answers: <b>We said</b> that there are five items whose minimum measure is one <b>handbreadth; we did not say</b> anything about a space whose measure is one <b>handbreadth by</b> one <b>handbreadth.</b>
The Gemara further asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> the following mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 5:2): <b>A stone that protrudes from the oven</b> by one <b>handbreadth,</b> which is used as a handle for lifting and carrying the oven, <b>and</b> similarly a stone that protrudes <b>from the stove three fingerbreadths</b> is considered as having <b>a connection</b> to the oven or stove with regard to ritual impurity. Consequently, if the oven or stove becomes impure, then the stone handle, which is classified as part of the oven, is likewise rendered impure. If the handle is longer than that, the additional length will be removed, so it is not considered to be part of the oven.
The Gemara answers: <b>When we said</b> that there are five items whose minimum measure is one handbreadth, we were referring to cases <b>where</b> if it <b>less than</b> one <b>handbreadth</b> it <b>is unfit</b> for the purpose of the item. <b>But here,</b> where a protruding stone one handbreadth long is considered a handle of the oven, it is <b>all the more so</b> the case <b>that</b> a protruding stone <b>less than</b> one <b>handbreadth</b> long <b>is</b> considered <b>a handle of</b> the <b>oven.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But aren’t there</b>

Daf 26b

toy <b>ovens with</b> which <b>girls</b> play, whose minimum measure with regard to ritual impurity is also one <b>handbreadth? As it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 5:1): A clay <b>oven</b> in <b>its original,</b> unbroken, <b>state</b> is susceptible to ritual impurity if it is <b>four</b> handbreadths tall. <b>And</b> with regard to an oven that became impure and was subsequently broken, if <b>its remains</b> include a piece <b>four</b> handbreadths tall, that piece remains impure. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis say: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said <b>in</b> the case of <b>a large</b> oven, made for regular use; <b>but with regard to a small</b> oven made for girls to play with, in <b>its original state, any size</b> is sufficient for it to be susceptible to contract impurity. <b>Once its construction is completed,</b> if the oven then becomes impure and is subsequently broken, if <b>its remains include</b> a piece that contains <b>the majority of</b> the oven, that piece remains impure.
The Gemara explains: <b>And how</b> small is the size defined by the mishna as <b>any size? Rabbi Yannai says:</b> One <b>handbreadth, as</b> people <b>fashion</b> toy <b>ovens for girls</b> one <b>handbreadth</b> high. This is another example of an item that has a minimum measure of one handbreadth, in addition to the five items listed by Rabbi Oshaya. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Oshaya <b>is not speaking of</b> matters that are subject to <b>dispute,</b> such as the minimum measure of an oven.
The Gemara adds: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> answer, the fact that Rabbi Oshaya does not mention a stone protruding from an oven can be explained in the same manner, since <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is also</b> subject to <b>a dispute. As the latter clause</b> of that mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 5:2) <b>teaches</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> When the Sages <b>said</b> that a stone protruding from an oven is considered a handle if it protrudes one <b>handbreadth,</b> they said so <b>only</b> with regard to a stone that protrudes <b>from the oven and toward the wall.</b> If the stone protrudes more than that, it is not considered a handle, as it is likely to be removed so that the oven can be moved closer to the wall. But if the stone protrudes toward the airspace of the house, it is considered an oven handle even if it protrudes more than one handbreadth.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But isn’t there</b> the <b>frame</b> of the Table in the Temple, which is one <b>handbreadth</b> wide, as stated in the Torah (Exodus 25:25)? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Oshaya <b>is not dealing with</b> matters <b>that are written</b> in the Torah. The Gemara further asks: <b>But isn’t there the Ark Cover,</b> which is one <b>handbreadth</b> thick, and its measure is not written explicitly in the Torah? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Oshaya <b>is not dealing with consecrated</b> items.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a cross beam, which is placed over the entrance to an alleyway in order to permit carrying items in the alleyway on Shabbat, and the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>it is enough for</b> a cross <b>beam to be</b> one <b>handbreadth wide?</b> The Gemara answers: Rabbi Oshaya <b>is not dealing with matters of rabbinic law. Rather,</b> he is speaking only <b>of</b> matters <b>that are written</b> in the Torah <b>but whose measure is not explicit</b> in the Torah.
§ <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta sat before Rav Kahana, and he sat and said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> For <b>all of the first three days</b> after a woman gives birth, if she discharges afterbirth, <b>we attribute the afterbirth to</b> the <b>offspring.</b> There is no concern that this afterbirth indicates the miscarriage of another offspring. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward,</b> once three days have passed since the birth, if the woman discharges an afterbirth, <b>we are concerned that</b> there might have been <b>another offspring</b> in the afterbirth, and the <i>halakhot</i> of a woman who discharged an offspring apply to her.
Rav Kahana <b>said to</b> Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel: <b>And did Rav say this? But didn’t Rav say</b> that <b>an offspring does not remain</b> in the womb <b>at all after another</b> offspring was born? Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel <b>was silent.</b> Rav Kahana <b>said to him: Perhaps</b> there is no contradiction between Rav’s two statements, as <b>here,</b> where he indicates that a second offspring can emerge even three days after the first, the reference is <b>to</b> a case where the first offspring is <b>a non-viable newborn,</b> whereas <b>there,</b> in the statement that a second offspring does not remain in the womb after the first offspring was born, he is referring <b>to</b> a case where the first offspring is <b>a viable</b> offspring.
Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel <b>said to him:</b> Are <b>you</b> the one who <b>says</b> this explanation <b>of Rav’s <i>halakha</i></b> of your own accord? Indeed, <b>Rav said this explicitly:</b> If a woman <b>discharged a non-viable newborn and subsequently discharged an afterbirth,</b> for <b>all of the first three days we attribute the afterbirth to</b> the <b>offspring. From this</b> point <b>forward,</b> if she discharged an afterbirth <b>we are concerned that</b> it contained <b>another offspring.</b> If she <b>gave birth</b> to a viable offspring <b>and subsequently discharged an afterbirth, even from now until ten days</b> after the birth <b>we are not concerned that</b> the afterbirth contained <b>another offspring.</b>
The Gemara relates: <b>Shmuel, Rav’s students, and Rav Yehuda were sitting</b> together. <b>Rav Yosef, son of Rav Menashya of D’vil, was passing</b> by <b>and walking toward them,</b> i.e., he was walking in their direction, and <b>he was hurrying and coming</b> along. Shmuel <b>said</b> to his company: <b>A man is coming toward us whom one can knock</b> down <b>with a straw of wheat, and he falls and stays down.</b> In other words, he cannot refute even a minor challenge to his opinions.
<b>In the meantime,</b> Rav Yosef, son of Rav Menashya, <b>arrived. Shmuel said to him: What did Rav say with regard to an afterbirth?</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to him</b> that <b>this is what Rav said: One attributes an afterbirth only to a viable item,</b> i.e., a viable offspring. <b>Shmuel</b> subsequently <b>asked all of Rav’s students</b> who were present whether Rav actually said this, <b>and they said to him</b> that Rav indeed said <b>so.</b> Shmuel <b>then looked at Rav Yehuda harshly,</b> as Rav Yehuda was also a student of Rav, but he had not transmitted this <i>halakha</i> to Shmuel after Rav’s death.
§ <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul asked Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: In the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> an item in <b>the form of a crow and</b> there is also <b>an afterbirth, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is the afterbirth attributed to the discharged item, or is there concern that the afterbirth might have contained another offspring? Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: One attributes</b> an afterbirth <b>only to an item whose species has an afterbirth.</b> Since crows do not have an afterbirth, the afterbirth cannot be associated with that discharged item.
Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul then asked Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: If the afterbirth is <b>tied to</b> the item that has the form of a crow, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: You asked</b> about <b>a matter that does not exist.</b> Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul <b>raised an objection to</b> this response from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a woman <b>who discharges a type of domesticated animal, undomesticated animal, or bird, and</b> she discharges <b>an afterbirth with them,</b> in an instance <b>when</b> the <b>afterbirth is tied to them we are not concerned about</b> the possibility of <b>another offspring.</b> If the <b>afterbirth is not tied to them, we are concerned that</b> the afterbirth contained <b>another offspring.</b> And <b>I impose upon them</b>

Daf 27a

the <b>stringency of two offspring, as I say: Perhaps</b> the <b>gestational sac of</b> this <b>afterbirth,</b> which contained the offspring, <b>disintegrated, and</b> the <b>afterbirth of</b> the <b>gestational sac</b> containing the fetus shaped like an animal also <b>disintegrated.</b> If so, there are two offspring, and as it is possible that one is male and the other female, the mother must observe the strictures of one who gave birth to both a male and a female. In any event, this <i>baraita</i> is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s claim that it is impossible for an afterbirth to be tied to a fetus that has the form of a bird.
§ <b>Rabba bar Sheila says</b> that <b>Rav Mattana says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: An incident</b> occurred where the Sages <b>attributed the afterbirth</b> that a woman discharged <b>to an offspring</b> that was born <b>up to ten days</b> beforehand. <b>And</b> Shmuel added that the Sages <b>said</b> that one <b>attributes</b> an afterbirth to an offspring that was born <b>only</b> in the case <b>of an afterbirth that emerges after the offspring</b> is born. By contrast, an afterbirth that emerges before the offspring is born is not attributed to that offspring.
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> There was <b>an incident</b> where the Sages <b>attributed the afterbirth to an offspring</b> that was born <b>up to twenty-three days</b> beforehand. <b>Rav Yosef said to him</b> a correction of his statement: <b>You said to us</b> on another occasion that the offspring was born <b>up to twenty-four</b> days beforehand.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avira, says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> There was <b>an incident</b> where a woman was pregnant with twins, <b>and</b> one <b>offspring remained</b> in the womb for <b>thirty-three days after the other</b> offspring was born. <b>Rav Yosef said to him: You said to us</b> on another occasion that the second offspring was born <b>thirty-four</b> days after the first.
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that if a woman <b>gives birth</b> to a baby <b>in</b> her <b>ninth</b> month, <b>she can give birth prematurely</b> (see <i>Rosh HaShana</i> 11a). <b>You find</b> a situation where there could be such a difference between the births of the two twins if <b>the form of one</b> of the twin fetuses <b>was completed at the end of the seventh</b> month, and it is born at that stage, <b>and the form of</b> the other <b>one was completed at the beginning of the ninth</b> month, and it is born then. In such a case, there can be a difference of thirty-four days between the births. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that a woman who <b>gives birth</b> to a baby <b>in</b> her <b>ninth</b> month <b>cannot give birth prematurely,</b> but rather she gives birth at the end of the ninth month, <b>what is there to say?</b>
The Gemara answers that one should <b>reverse the statements:</b> The difference of <b>thirty-three</b> days was stated <b>with regard to</b> a case of <b>an afterbirth</b> that was discharged an extended period after the birth of the offspring, whereas the gap of <b>twenty-three</b> days was stated <b>with regard to</b> a case of an <b>offspring</b> that was born after its twin.
<b>Rabbi Avin bar Rav Adda says</b> that <b>Rav Menaḥem of the village of She’arim, and some say</b> that he was from <b>Beit She’arim, says: An incident</b> occurred where <b>one offspring remained</b> in the womb <b>after the other</b> was born for <b>three months, and</b> both twins <b>are sitting before us in the study hall. And who are they?</b> They are <b>Yehuda and Ḥizkiyya, the sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t the Master say</b> that <b>a woman cannot become pregnant and again become pregnant</b> with another offspring while she is pregnant with the first? <b>Abaye says:</b> Both twins were conceived at the same time; <b>it was one drop</b> of semen <b>and it split into two. The form of one was completed at the beginning of the seventh</b> month, <b>and</b> the form of the other <b>one</b> was completed <b>at the end of the ninth</b> month.
§ The mishna teaches that if there is <b>an afterbirth in the house, the house is impure</b> in the sense that everything under the roof contracts impurity imparted by a corpse. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If there is <b>an afterbirth in the house, the house is impure.</b> The reason is <b>not that the</b> status of <b>an afterbirth</b> is that of <b>an offspring; rather,</b> it is <b>that there is no afterbirth without an offspring,</b> and the offspring rendered the contents of the house impure. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon deem</b> the contents of the house <b>pure.</b>
These Sages <b>said to Rabbi Meir: Do you not concede that if</b> people <b>removed</b> the afterbirth <b>to the outer room</b> of the house <b>in a basin, that</b> the room <b>is pure?</b> Rabbi Meir <b>said to them</b> in response: <b>Indeed,</b> that room is pure; <b>but why</b> so? <b>Because</b> the offspring <b>does not exist</b> anymore, i.e., it presumably disintegrated while it was moved from place to place.
These Sages <b>said to him: Just as</b> the offspring <b>does not exist</b> when the afterbirth is moved <b>to the outer room, so too, it does not exist</b> when the afterbirth is <b>in the inner room</b> either. In other words, the offspring presumably disintegrated while it was moved from the woman’s womb to the place in the house where it is located. Rabbi Meir <b>said to them:</b> A situation in which the offspring <b>disintegrated once,</b> when the afterbirth was moved to its first location in the house, <b>is not comparable to</b> a case where the offspring <b>disintegrated twice,</b> i.e., when the afterbirth was first moved to the interior room of the house and then moved to the outer room.
§ <b>Rav Pappa sat behind Rav Beivai</b> in the study hall <b>before</b> their teacher <b>Rav Hamnuna, and he sat and said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon,</b> that a house in which there is an afterbirth is pure? <b>He holds</b> that with regard to <b>any</b> item that has <b>ritual impurity with which</b> there <b>was mixed</b> an item <b>of another type,</b> it <b>is nullified</b> by the other item and is pure. Consequently, in the case of an offspring that disintegrated, the disintegrated offspring is nullified by the blood of the childbirth.
<b>Rav Pappa said to</b> Rav Beivai, who was a greater scholar than he, and to Rav Hamnuna his teacher: <b>This is also the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei,</b> who agree with Rabbi Shimon in the above <i>baraita</i>. Rav Beivai and Rav Hamnuna <b>laughed at him: What is different</b> about the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei? Since the statement of Rabbi Shimon is attributed to them as well, it is <b>obvious</b> that their reasoning is the same.
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> with regard to this incident: <b>A person should say a matter even</b> as obvious <b>as this</b> one, <b>and one should not be silent in the presence of his teacher,</b> despite the possibility that other people might laugh at him, <b>because it is stated: “If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself, or if you have planned devices [<i>zammota</i>], lay your hand over your mouth”</b> (Proverbs 30:32). One who acts “foolishly” over matters of Torah by not hesitating to issue statements that might be ridiculed will ultimately be exalted and lifted up. Conversely, one who muzzles [<i>zamam</i>] himself due to embarrassment will end up with his hand over his mouth, unable to answer questions that are posed to him.
With regard to Rabbi Shimon’s opinion that the woman is pure because the offspring is nullified by the blood of childbirth, the Gemara notes: <b>And Rabbi Shimon follows his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a ladleful [<i>melo tarvad</i>] of dust</b> from a corpse, which is the minimum amount that renders everything in a house impure, <b>into which any amount of dirt fell,</b> the house is <b>impure; and Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>pure.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon?</b> Why is the house pure when it contains a ladleful of dust from a corpse? <b>Rabba said: I found the Sages of the study hall of Rav sitting and saying:</b> The reason Rabbi Shimon deems the house pure is that <b>it is impossible for</b> there <b>not to be two grains of dirt</b> that are <b>more than one grain of dust</b> from the corpse, in a certain place in the mixture. <b>And</b> as that grain of dust from the corpse is nullified by the dirt, the amount of dust that remains <b>is insufficient</b> for rendering the house impure.
<b>And I said to them: On the contrary,</b> according to this reasoning the house should certainly be impure, as <b>it is impossible for</b> there <b>not to be two grains of dust</b> from the corpse that are <b>more than</b>

Daf 27b

<b>one grain of dirt</b> in a certain place in the mixture. That grain of dirt is thereby nullified by the dust of the corpse, <b>and</b> consequently <b>the measure</b> of the dust <b>increases.</b>
<b>Rather, Rabba said</b> that <b>this is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon:</b> The <i>halakha</i> with regard to a corpse in <b>its ultimate state</b> of dust <b>is like</b> the <i>halakha</i> in <b>its initial state</b> of decomposition: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>its initial state,</b> if <b>another matter</b> is mixed with the decomposing corpse it <b>serves as a nullification [<i>gangilon</i>] of</b> the corpse’s impurity, as the dust of a decomposed corpse can impart impurity only if it is not mingled with the dust of any other substance, <b>so too,</b> in the corpse’s <b>ultimate state</b> of dust, if <b>another matter</b> is mixed with it, that <b>serves as a nullification of</b> the impurity of the dust.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the source for the <i>halakha</i> that the dust of a corpse imparts impurity only if it is not mingled with the dust of any other substance? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Which is a corpse that has</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>dust,</b> i.e., whose dust imparts impurity; <b>and which is a corpse that does not have</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>dust?</b> If a corpse <b>was buried naked in a marble coffin or on a stone floor, that is a corpse that has</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>dust</b> that imparts impurity. Since any dust found there must have come from the corpse, it imparts impurity.
<b>And what is a corpse that does not have</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>dust?</b> If a corpse <b>was buried in its cloak, or in a wooden coffin, or on a brick floor, that is a corpse that does not have</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>dust</b> that imparts impurity, as it is assumed that some of the dust is from particles of the clothes, wood, or bricks, and the dust from a decomposed corpse imparts impurity only if it is not mingled with the dust of any other substance. The <i>baraita</i> adds another <i>halakha</i> with regard to the impurity of the dust of a corpse: <b>And</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that the <b>dust</b> of a corpse is impure <b>only with regard to</b> the corpse of a person who <b>died</b> naturally, <b>excluding one who was killed, whose</b> dust <b>is not</b> impure.
§ The Gemara returns to discuss <b>the</b> matter <b>itself,</b> i.e., the <i>baraita</i> cited above that clarifies the opinion of Rabbi Shimon: In the case of <b>a ladleful of dust</b> from a corpse <b>into which any amount of dirt fell,</b> the house <b>is impure; and Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>pure.</b> The <i>baraita</i> continues: In the case of <b>a ladleful of dust</b> from a corpse <b>that was scattered in the house, the house is impure.</b> Provided that there is a sufficient amount of dust in the house, the house is impure, even if the dust is scattered. <b>And Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>pure.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And it is necessary</b> for the <i>baraita</i> to state both of these <i>halakhot</i>. <b>As, if</b> the <i>baraita</i> had <b>taught us</b> only <b>the first</b> <i>halakha</i>, with regard to dust from a corpse in which dirt was mixed, one might have thought that it is specifically <b>in that</b> case that <b>the Rabbis say</b> the house is impure, <b>because</b> the dust is <b>concentrated</b> in one place; <b>but</b> if the dust <b>was scattered,</b> one might <b>say</b> that the Rabbis <b>concede to Rabbi Shimon that</b> the house is pure. The reasoning is <b>that</b> if an item <b>overlies</b> a collection of dust of a corpse that is insufficient to render it impure <b>and also overlies</b> another collection of similar size, where together these collections constitute a sufficient amount to render the item and everything under it impure, it <b>is not</b> impure.
<b>And if</b> the <i>baraita</i> had <b>taught us</b> the <i>halakha</i> only <b>with regard to this</b> second case, where the dust of the corpse was scattered, one might have thought that it is specifically <b>in this</b> case that <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that the house is pure, <b>as</b> an item that <b>overlies</b> an insufficient collection of the dust of a corpse <b>and also overlies</b> another collection, where together these collections constitute a sufficient amount to render the item impure, <b>is not</b> impure. <b>But in that</b> first case, where dirt was mixed with the dust of the corpse, one might <b>say</b> that Rabbi Shimon <b>concedes to the Rabbis</b> that the house is impure. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> for the <i>baraita</i> to teach both cases.
There is a different dispute between Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis that <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 2:2): If a house contains <b>a ladleful of dirt from a cemetery and</b> slightly <b>more,</b> the house <b>is impure; and Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>pure.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis?</b> The Gemara answers: They deem the house impure <b>as it is impossible for</b> slightly <b>more than a ladleful of dirt from a cemetery not to contain a ladleful of dust</b> from a corpse.
§ The Gemara asks: <b>Now that you say</b> that <b>the reason that Rabbi Shimon</b> deems the house pure, in a case where it contains dust from a corpse in which dirt was mixed, is <b>that</b> in his opinion the <i>halakha</i> of a corpse in <b>its ultimate state</b> of dust <b>is like</b> the <i>halakha</i> in <b>its initial state</b> of decomposition, then <b>with regard to</b> a case where there is <b>an afterbirth</b> in the house, <b>what is the reason</b> that Rabbi Shimon deems the house pure? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The Sages <b>touched upon it,</b> i.e., deemed the house pure, <b>due to</b> the <b>nullification</b> of the disintegrated offspring <b>by</b> the <b>majority</b> of the blood that emerged during the miscarriage, in which the afterbirth was mixed.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan follows his</b> line of <b>reasoning</b> in this regard, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov</b> both <b>said the same thing,</b> i.e., they both issued rulings based on the same principle. The relevant statement of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> is <b>that which we said,</b> i.e., that if a woman discharged an afterbirth the house is pure, as the offspring is nullified by the blood that emerged during the miscarriage. <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> ben Ya’akov said that <b>which is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 21a): <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> In the case of <b>a large animal that expelled a mass of</b> congealed <b>blood, that</b> mass <b>must be buried,</b> as perhaps there was a male fetus there, which was consecrated as a firstborn when it emerged, <b>and</b> the animal <b>is exempt from</b> having any future offspring being counted <b>a firstborn.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to that</b> <i>halakha</i>: The mass of congealed blood <b>does not impart ritual impurity, neither through</b> physical <b>contact nor through carrying</b> it. It does not have the status of an unslaughtered animal carcass, which does impart impurity in such manners. The Gemara asks: <b>But since</b> the mass <b>does not impart impurity, neither through contact nor through carrying,</b> which indicates that it is not considered a fetus, <b>why</b> must it be <b>buried?</b> The Gemara answers: It must be buried <b>in order to publicize that</b> the animal <b>is exempt from</b> having its future offspring being counted <b>a firstborn.</b>
The Gemara asks: If the animal’s subsequent offspring is not counted a firstborn, <b>evidently</b> the mass <b>is</b> treated like <b>a full-fledged offspring. But</b> if so, <b>why does Rabbi Ḥiyya teach</b> that <b>it does not impart impurity, neither through</b> physical <b>contact nor through carrying? Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>due to</b> the halakhic <b>nullification</b> of a foreign substance <b>in a majority</b> of permitted substances that the Sages <b>touched upon it,</b> to exclude it from impurity through contact or carrying. In other words, the fetus is considered a full-fledged offspring, but it does not impart impurity, because it is nullified by the rest of the congealed mass.
§ The Gemara resumes its discussion of the opinion of Rabbi Shimon that if a woman discharges an afterbirth in a house, the house is pure. <b>Rabbi Ami says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And Rabbi Shimon concedes that its mother is impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth.</b>
<b>A certain elder said to Rabbi Ami: I will explain to you the reason</b> for the statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan. As the verse states: “If a woman bears seed and gives birth to a male,</b> she shall be impure seven days, as in the days of the menstruation of her sickness she shall be impure” (Leviticus 12:2). This indicates that <b>even</b> if a woman <b>gives birth to</b> an offspring that is <b>similar only to the seed that she bore,</b> i.e., if the offspring liquefied and became similar to semen, the woman is <b>impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth.</b>
§ <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> In the case of a fetus in <b>a gestational sac, that was mashed in its</b> amniotic <b>fluid</b> by being shaken violently, <b>it is rendered like a corpse that was deformed,</b> and therefore it does not impart impurity to other items that are under the same roof.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to Reish Lakish: From where do we</b> derive <b>that a corpse that was deformed is pure? If we say</b> it is derived <b>from that which Rabbi Shabbtai says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak from Migdal [<i>Migdala’a</i>] says, and some say</b> from that which <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak from Migdal says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shabbtai says,</b> that cannot be correct. The Gemara cites the relevant statement: With regard to <b>a corpse that was burned but its form [<i>veshildo</i>]</b> still <b>exists,</b> i.e., it still has the form of a human corpse, it <b>is impure. There was an incident</b> involving such a corpse, <b>and</b> the Sages <b>deemed impure</b> all items that were under the <b>large openings</b> of the house where the corpse was located, as these openings were fit for the removal of the corpse from the house through them.

Daf 28a

<b>But they deemed pure</b> all items that were under the <b>small openings</b> to the house, i.e., those whose width was less than four handbreadths. <b>And you infer from</b> this statement that <b>the reason</b> the large openings are impure in such a case is <b>that the form of</b> the corpse still <b>exists; but otherwise,</b> i.e., if the corpse was deformed, then even the large openings are <b>pure.</b>
The Gemara explains why one cannot infer from here that a deformed corpse does not impart impurity to other items that are under the same roof: <b>On the contrary,</b> one can <b>infer from</b> this statement <b>in</b> the opposite <b>manner: It is</b> only because <b>the form of</b> the corpse still <b>exists that</b> the Sages <b>deemed pure</b> the <b>small openings</b> of the house; <b>but otherwise,</b> the <b>small openings are also impure, as each and every one</b> of them <b>is fit for taking out</b> the corpse through them, <b>each limb one</b> by <b>one.</b> Consequently, no proof can be derived from this statement in support of the opinion of Reish Lakish.
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>did Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> that a deformed corpse imparts impurity to items that are under the same roof? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 2:2): With regard to <b>the ashes of burned</b> corpses that are not mixed with other types of ashes or dirt, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that <b>its measure for</b> imparting impurity to items that are under the same roof is a <b>quarter</b> of a <i>kav</i>. Clearly, Rabbi Eliezer maintains that a deformed corpse imparts impurity to items that are under the same roof.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case of <b>a corpse that was burned but its form</b> still <b>exists?</b> How is this possible? <b>Abaye says:</b> It is possible in a case <b>where</b> one <b>burned</b> the corpse <b>on top of</b> a hard <b>leather spread [<i>katavla</i>],</b> which does not burn, and therefore the corpse retains its shape even after it is burned. <b>Rava says:</b> It is possible in a case <b>where</b> one <b>burned</b> the corpse <b>on top of a marble slate [<i>apoderim</i>]. Ravina says:</b> It is possible in a case <b>where</b> the corpse <b>was charred</b> without being reduced to ashes.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a woman <b>who discharges a shaped hand,</b> i.e., its fingers are discernible, <b>or a shaped foot, its mother is impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth,</b> as the hand or foot certainly came from a full-fledged fetus. <b>And we are not concerned</b> that <b>perhaps they came from</b> a fetus with <b>a sealed,</b> i.e., deficient, <b>body,</b> in which case the miscarriage does not have the status of childbirth with regard to ritual impurity. The reason is that most pregnant women give birth to a fully formed fetus, and therefore it is presumed that the hand or foot came from a whole fetus that was squashed during childbirth.
<b>Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna both say:</b> Although the woman observes the period of impurity of a woman after childbirth, <b>we do not give her</b> the <b>days of purity</b> following the period of impurity. <b>What is the reason?</b> Although it is presumed that the discharged limbs came from a full-fledged fetus, it is unknown whether or when the woman discharged the rest of the fetus, and the principle is that a woman who discharges observes her periods of impurity and purity when the majority of the limbs of the fetus emerge. Therefore, one can <b>say</b> that perhaps <b>her childbirth was distant,</b> i.e., the woman discharged the majority of the limbs of the fetus long before she discharged this hand or foot, and consequently her period of purity has already ended.
<b>Rav Yosef raises an objection</b> from a mishna (29a): In the case of a woman <b>who discharges and it is not known what</b> sex fetus <b>she discharged, she shall observe</b> the strictures of a woman who gave birth both <b>to a male and to a female. And if it enters your mind</b> that in <b>any case like this</b> one should <b>say</b> that perhaps the woman’s <b>childbirth was distant, let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> that the woman shall observe the strictures of a woman who gave birth to both a male and a female, <b>and</b> also observes the strictures <b>of a menstruating woman.</b> Since it is possible that the item she discharged was a limb from a fetus the majority of which she discharged a long time beforehand, then she must forgo the period of purity observed by a woman who gave birth, and treat any blood that emerges during this period like the blood of a menstruating woman.
<b>Abaye says</b> in response: <b>If</b> the mishna had <b>taught</b> that the woman observes the strictures <b>of a menstruating woman, I would say</b> that as her status as a woman after childbirth is uncertain, since she observes the strictures of a menstruating woman with regard to any blood that emerges, <b>she brings an offering</b> like any woman after childbirth, <b>but it is not eaten</b> by the priests. It might be thought that perhaps the woman did not give birth at all and is not obligated to bring the offering, and therefore her bird sin offering cannot be eaten. By omitting the <i>halakha</i> that the woman observes the strictures of a menstruating woman, the mishna <b>teaches us that</b> her offering <b>is eaten.</b> This indicates that she certainly discharged an offspring; the uncertainty is only about when she discharged it.
§ <b>Rav Huna says:</b> If <b>a fetus extended its hand out</b> of the womb <b>and</b> then <b>returned it, its mother is impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after childbirth. This is considered childbirth, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to Tamar, Judah’s daughter-in-law: <b>“And it happened when she gave birth that one put out a hand</b>…and it happened that as he drew back his hand, his brother came out” (Genesis 38:28–29). Evidently, the fetus extending out its hand was considered childbirth, despite the fact that it subsequently drew back the hand.
<b>Rav Yehuda raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a fetus extended its hand out</b> of the womb, <b>its mother</b> need <b>not be concerned</b> that she is considered a woman after childbirth <b>with regard to any matter. Rav Naḥman says</b> in response: The meaning of this statement <b>was explained to me</b> personally <b>by Rav Huna</b> himself: <b>With regard to being concerned</b> that she has the status of a woman after childbirth, the woman must be <b>concerned,</b> i.e., she must observe the strictures of a woman after childbirth. But <b>we do not give her</b> a period of <b>days of purity</b> like any woman after childbirth, <b>until most of</b> the fetus <b>emerges.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>say</b> that <b>its mother</b> need <b>not be concerned</b> that she is considered a woman after childbirth <b>with regard to any matter? Abaye says:</b> The <i>baraita</i> means that the woman need <b>not be concerned with regard to any matter by Torah law; but by rabbinic law</b> she must be <b>concerned,</b> i.e., she is required to observe the strictures of a woman after childbirth. The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t</b> Rav Huna <b>cite a verse</b> as proof for his statement that if a fetus extended its hand out it is considered childbirth? The Gemara answers: This <i>halakha</i> applies <b>by rabbinic law, and the verse is</b> cited as <b>mere support</b> for it, i.e., it is not an actual source.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A woman <b>who discharges</b> or gives birth to <b>a <i>tumtum</i>,</b> whose sexual organs are obscured, <b>or</b> to <b>a hermaphrodite [<i>ve’androginos</i>],</b> who has both male and female sexual organs, <b>shall observe</b> the strictures of a woman who gave birth both <b>to a male and to a female.</b> She is impure for fourteen days like a woman who gave birth to a female, but blood that she sees thereafter is pure only until forty days after birth, like for a woman who gave birth to a male.
In a case where she gave birth to twins, if they are <b>a <i>tumtum</i> and a male,</b> or <b>a hermaphrodite and a male, she observes</b> the strictures of a woman who gave birth both <b>to a male and to a female.</b> But if the twins are <b>a <i>tumtum</i> and a female,</b> or <b>a hermaphrodite and a female, she shall observe</b> the periods of purity and impurity established by the Torah <b>for</b> a woman who gives birth to <b>a female alone.</b> Regardless of the status of the <i>tumtum</i> and the hermaphrodite, the woman’s seven days of impurity and her succeeding thirty-three days of purity are subsumed in the fourteen days of impurity and sixty-six days of purity for a female.
If the fetus <b>emerged in pieces, or</b> if it emerged <b>reversed,</b> i.e., feetfirst rather than headfirst, <b>when most of its</b> limbs <b>emerge,</b> its status <b>is like</b> that of a child <b>born,</b> with regard to the impurity of a woman after childbirth. If the fetus <b>emerged in</b> the <b>usual manner,</b> headfirst, it is not considered born <b>until most of its head emerges. And what is</b> considered <b>most of its head?</b> It is <b>from when its forehead emerges.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> that with regard to a woman who gives birth to <b>a <i>tumtum</i> alone, or a hermaphrodite alone,</b> the mishna <b>states</b> that <b>she shall observe</b> the strictures of a woman who gave birth both <b>to a male and to a female,</b> as the sex of the offspring is uncertain, <b>is it necessary</b> for the mishna to rule that if a woman gives birth to twins, <b>a <i>tumtum</i> and a male,</b> or <b>a hermaphrodite and a male,</b> she shall observe the strictures of a woman who gave birth to both a male and a female?
The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> for the mishna to state this <i>halakha</i>, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>since Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that the sex of a fetus is determined at the moment of conception, in that if the <b>woman emits seed first she gives birth to a male,</b> and if the <b>man emits seed first she gives birth to a female,</b> therefore one might <b>say</b> that <b>since this</b> offspring that was born with the <i>tumtum</i> or hermaphrodite <b>is male, that</b> <i>tumtum</i> or hermaphrodite <b>is also male.</b> Consequently, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the woman shall observe the strictures of a woman who gave birth to a female as well, as one can <b>say</b> that perhaps <b>both</b> the man and the woman <b>emitted seed at the same time,</b> which would mean that <b>this</b> offspring <b>is male and that</b> <i>tumtum</i> or hermaphrodite <b>is female.</b>
§ <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> In the case of <b>a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite who saw a white</b> gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>ziva</i>], for which a man is impure, <b>or</b> who emitted <b>a red</b> discharge that had the appearance of menstrual blood, for which a woman is impure, if they entered the Temple <b>they are not liable for entering the Temple</b> in a state of impurity, as perhaps they are pure, in accordance with their true sex. <b>And</b> if they touched <i>teruma</i> after such a discharge, <b>one does not burn the <i>teruma</i> due to their</b> contact, as although impure <i>teruma</i> must be burned, the impurity in this case is uncertain.
If a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite <b>saw white</b> <i>ziva</i> <b>and red</b> blood <b>as one,</b> i.e., they emitted both <i>ziva</i> and blood and are therefore impure regardless of their sex, <b>they are</b> still <b>not liable for entering the Temple, but one does burn <i>teruma</i> due to their</b> contact. The reason they are not liable for entering the Temple, despite the fact that they are definitely impure, is <b>that it is stated: “Both male and female</b>

Daf 28b

<b>you shall send out,</b> out of the camp you shall send them, so that they not impurify their camp, in the midst of which I dwell” (Numbers 5:3). It is derived from the verse that only <b>a definite male</b> or <b>a definite female</b> is liable for entering the Temple in a state of impurity, <b>but not a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the following <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> the opinion of Rav: In the case of <b>a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite who saw white</b> <i>ziva</i> <b>or red</b> blood, <b>they are not liable for entering the Temple</b> in a state of impurity, <b>and</b> if they touch <i>teruma</i>, <b>one does not burn the <i>teruma</i> due to their</b> contact. If they <b>saw white</b> <i>ziva</i> <b>and red</b> blood <b>as one,</b> i.e., they emitted both <i>ziva</i> and blood, <b>they are</b> still <b>not liable for entering the Temple, but one burns <i>teruma</i> due to their</b> contact.
The Gemara reasons: <b>What is the reason</b> that they are not liable for entering the Temple despite the fact that they are definitely impure? Is it <b>not because it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“Both male and female you shall send out,”</b> from which it is derived that only <b>a definite male</b> or <b>a definite female</b> could be liable for entering the Temple in a state of impurity, <b>but not a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite? Ulla says: No,</b> Rav’s opinion cannot be proved from this <i>baraita</i>, as in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b>
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shevuot</i> 14b) that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to the sliding-scale offering the verse states: “Or if a person touches any impure thing…or the carcass of a non-kosher <b>creeping animal, and it is hidden from him”</b> (Leviticus 5:2). A precise reading of this verse indicates that <b>if</b> one has <b>a lapse of awareness</b> that he contracted ritual impurity by touching a carcass of <b>a creeping animal,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sliding-scale offering for defiling the Temple or the sacrificial food, <b>but he is not liable</b> to bring such an offering <b>for a lapse of awareness</b> that he is entering the <b>Temple</b> or partaking of sacrificial food.
<b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that it is derived from the phrase: <b>“And it is hidden from him, so that he is impure”</b> (Leviticus 5:2), that <b>for a lapse of awareness</b> that one had contracted <b>ritual impurity,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sliding-scale offering, <b>but</b> he <b>is not liable</b> to bring an offering <b>for a lapse of awareness</b> that he is entering the <b>Temple</b> or partaking of sacrificial food.
<b>And we say</b> with regard to this mishna: <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between</b> the opinions of Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Akiva? They are apparently stating the same <i>halakha</i>. <b>And Ḥizkiyya says: There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> in a case where one initially knew that he had contracted ritual impurity, but he did not know whether the impurity was contracted from a carcass of <b>a creeping animal or</b> from <b>the carcass of an unslaughtered animal. As Rabbi Eliezer holds</b> that for one to be liable to bring an offering, <b>we require that he</b> initially <b>know whether he contracted impurity from</b> a carcass of <b>a creeping animal</b> or <b>whether he contracted impurity from an unslaughtered animal carcass,</b> and if he never knew this, he does not bring an offering. <b>And Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that for him to be liable to bring an offering, <b>we do not require</b> that he know this detail, since he knows in general terms that he contracted impurity.
The Gemara infers: <b>Doesn’t Rabbi Eliezer say there,</b> in that mishna, that <b>we require</b> one to bring an offering for entering the Temple in a state of impurity only <b>if he knew</b> initially <b>whether he contracted impurity from</b> a carcass of <b>a creeping animal</b> or <b>whether he contracted impurity from an unslaughtered animal carcass? Here, too,</b> with regard to a hermaphrodite or a <i>tumtum</i> who emitted both <i>ziva</i> and blood, they are not obligated to bring an offering according to Rabbi Eliezer, as <b>we require</b> one to bring an offering only <b>if he knew whether he became impure due to</b> the <b>white</b> <i>ziva</i> he emitted or <b>whether he became impure due to</b> the <b>red</b> blood he emitted.
<b>But according to Rabbi Akiva, who said</b> that one <b>is obligated</b> to bring an offering <b>due to</b> his initial knowledge of his <b>impurity</b> even if he did not know the exact cause of his impurity, <b>here too,</b> in the case of a hermaphrodite or a <i>tumtum</i> who emitted both <i>ziva</i> and blood, <b>he is obligated</b> to bring an offering <b>due to</b> his initial knowledge of his <b>impurity,</b> despite the fact that he does not know whether he is impure due to the blood or the <i>ziva</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rav,</b> who holds that an impure <i>tumtum</i> or hermaphrodite is not liable for entering the Temple but that any <i>teruma</i> that he touches is burned, <b>what is different</b> with regard to <b>entering the Temple,</b> for <b>which</b> he is <b>not</b> liable? The reason it is different is <b>that it is written: “Both male and female you shall send out,”</b> from which it is derived that <b>a definite male</b> or <b>a definite female</b> is liable for entering the Temple in a state of impurity, <b>but not a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite.</b>
<b>If so, we should not burn <i>teruma</i></b> that he touches either, <b>as it is written</b> in a verse dealing with these types of impurity: “This is the law of the <i>zav</i>, and of one from whom the flow of semen emerges, so that he is thereby impure; and of her that is sick with her menstrual status, <b>and they who have an issue, whether a male or a female”</b> (Leviticus 15:32–33). It can similarly be derived from this verse that these types of impurity apply only to <b>a definite male</b> or <b>a definite female, but not</b> to <b>a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>is necessary for</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak, as Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> The term <b>“whether a male”</b> serves <b>to include a male leper</b> as a primary source of impurity <b>with regard to the sources of his</b> bodily emissions. In other words, the various emissions of a leper, e.g., his saliva and urine, have the status of a primary source of impurity, and therefore they transmit impurity to a person or utensil that touches them. And the term <b>“or a female”</b> serves <b>to include a female</b> as a primary source of impurity <b>with regard to the sources of her</b> bodily emissions.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>This</b> verse: “Both male and female you shall send out” (Numbers 5:3), from which Rav derives that the prohibition against an impure person entering the Temple does not apply to one whose sex is uncertain, <b>is also necessary</b> for another <i>halakha</i>. That <i>halakha</i> is that the obligation to remove from the Temple any impure person or item applies only <b>to one that has</b> the option of attaining ritual <b>purity</b> by immersing <b>in a ritual bath; this excludes</b> an impure <b>earthenware vessel,</b> which cannot be purified by immersing it in a ritual bath. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei.</b> Consequently, Rav’s <i>halakha</i> cannot be derived from that verse.
The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> that the verse serves to teach Rabbi Yosei’s <i>halakha</i> alone, <b>let the Merciful One write:</b> Any <b>person</b> you shall send out, as this would also exclude earthenware vessels. Rav’s <i>halakha</i> is derived from the fact that the wording of the verse is: “Both male and female.”
<b>And if you would say</b> in response that <b>if the Merciful One had written:</b> Any <b>person</b> you shall send out, <b>I would say</b> that impure <b>metal vessels</b> need <b>not</b> be removed from the Temple either, as they are not included in the term: Any person, this is not correct. The Gemara elaborates: The <i>halakha</i> that impure metal vessels must be removed from the Temple <b>is derived from</b> the previous verse: “That they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that has an issue, and <b>whatever is impure by the dead”</b> (Numbers 5:2). Therefore, <b>why do I</b> need the verse to write: <b>“Both male and female</b> you shall send out,” instead of simply stating: Any person you shall send out? Clearly, the phrase: “Both male and female,” is necessary <b>for</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of Rav.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, one can <b>say</b> that <b>the entire</b> phrase <b>comes for Rav’s</b> <i>halakha</i>, and not the <i>halakha</i> of Rabbi Yosei. The Gemara answers: <b>If so, let</b> the verse <b>write: Male and female. What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>“Both male and female”?</b> The verse is referring <b>to any</b> ritually impure <b>item that has</b> the same <i>halakha</i> that applies to both males and females, i.e., it can attain <b>purity by</b> being immersed in <b>a ritual bath;</b> this excludes earthenware vessels.
With regard to Rav’s <i>halakha</i> that the prohibition of entering the Temple in a state of ritual impurity does not apply to one who is a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite, the Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then even <b>when they become impure with other types of impurity,</b> in addition to the impurity of a <i>zav</i> or a menstruating woman, a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite <b>should</b> likewise <b>not be sent out</b> of the Temple, as the passage from which a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite are excluded is also referring to other types of impurity: “That they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that has an issue, and whatever is impure by the dead” (Numbers 5:2). The Gemara answers: <b>The</b> next <b>verse states: “Both male,”</b> which is referring <b>to impurity</b> caused by a substance <b>that is emitted from the male</b> organ, i.e., <i>ziva</i>.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to Rav’s derivation: <b>And</b> is it correct that <b>anywhere that</b> the phrase <b>“both male and female” is written</b> in the Torah, this <b>comes to exclude a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite? But isn’t</b> a similar expression stated <b>with regard to valuations, as it is written:</b> “For <b>the male…</b>fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the Sanctuary. And if she is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels” (Leviticus 27:3–4).
<b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is derived from the term <b>“the male”: But not a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite <b>shall not be</b> valuated <b>according to the valuation of a man,</b> which is fifty shekels, <b>but shall be</b> valuated <b>according to the valuation of a woman,</b> which is thirty shekels. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “The male,”</b> and the following verse states: <b>“And if she is a female,”</b> indicating that these <i>halakhot</i> apply only to <b>a definite male</b> or <b>a definite female, but not</b> to <b>a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite.</b>
The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>The reason</b> a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite are excluded is <b>that it is written: “The male…and if she is a female,”</b> which indicates <b>that</b> if the verse had written: <b>Male and female,</b> without the superfluous words “the” and “if,” it would <b>not</b> have been derived that the verse <b>excludes</b> a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite. This apparently contradicts the opinion of Rav, who excludes a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite from the prohibition of entering the Temple in a state of impurity merely due to the phrase: “Male and female” (Numbers 5:3). The Gemara answers: In <b>that</b> verse with regard to valuations, the words “male” and “female” are themselves <b>necessary</b>

Daf 29a

in order <b>to differentiate between the valuation of a man and the valuation of a woman.</b> Therefore, it could not have been derived from that verse that a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite are excluded from the <i>halakha</i> of valuations, were it not for the superfluous words “the” and “if.”
§ The mishna teaches that if the fetus <b>emerged in pieces, or</b> if it emerged <b>reversed,</b> i.e., feetfirst rather than headfirst; when most of its limbs emerge, its status is like that of a child born, with regard to the impurity of a woman after childbirth. <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Even</b> if <b>the head is among</b> the limbs that emerged, provided that the majority of the limbs did not yet emerge, the fetus is not considered born.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: They taught</b> in the mishna that the woman is not impure unless most of the fetus’s limbs emerged <b>only</b> in a case <b>where the head is not among</b> the limbs that emerged; <b>but</b> if <b>the head is among them, the head exempts</b> the woman’s future offspring from the obligation of primogeniture, as the fetus is considered born.
The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that these Sages <b>disagree with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel? As Shmuel said</b> that if a woman is pregnant with twins, and <b>the head</b> of one of the fetuses emerges and then disappears back into the womb, this <b>does not exempt</b> the other fetus from the obligation of primogeniture should it be born first. Shmuel says this specifically <b>in</b> a case of <b>non-viable newborns,</b> i.e., where the fetus whose head emerged was a non-viable newborn and the one that was eventually born first is a viable offspring. But if both are viable offspring, the emergence of the head is considered birth. The suggestion is that Rabbi Elazar agrees with the opinion of Shmuel, whereas Rabbi Yoḥanan disagrees with the opinion of Shmuel and maintains that the emergence of the head is considered birth even in the case of a non-viable newborn.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion, as it is possible that <b>in</b> the case of <b>a whole</b> non-viable newborn, <b>everyone,</b> i.e., Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>agrees</b> that the emergence of the head is considered a birth, contrary to the opinion of Shmuel. <b>When they disagree,</b> it is <b>in</b> the case of a fetus that emerged <b>in pieces. As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Elazar, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is</b> specifically <b>in</b> the case of <b>a whole</b> non-viable newborn <b>that</b> the emergence of the head <b>is considered</b> birth, whereas <b>with regard to</b> a fetus that emerged <b>in pieces</b> it <b>is not considered</b> birth; <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that <b>in</b> the case of a fetus that emerged <b>in pieces as well,</b> the emergence of the head <b>is considered</b> birth.
The Gemara cites <b>another version</b> of this discussion. <b>The reason</b> it is necessary for most of the limbs of the fetus to emerge for it to be considered born is <b>that it emerged in pieces, or</b> that it emerged <b>reversed,</b> i.e., feet first. It may be inferred from here that if it emerged <b>in its proper manner,</b> headfirst and whole, it is considered born, even according to Rabbi Elazar. Therefore, if the woman is pregnant with twins, the emergence of <b>the head exempts</b> the other twin from the obligations of primogeniture. Evidently, <b>both</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar <b>do not hold</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Shmuel, as Shmuel said</b> that the emergence of <b>the head</b> of one of the twins <b>does not exempt</b> the other <b>in</b> a case of <b>non-viable newborns.</b>
<b>There are those who teach this <i>halakha</i> by itself,</b> i.e., not in reference to the mishna: <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The emergence of <b>the head</b> of a non-viable newborn <b>is not</b> considered <b>like</b> the emergence of <b>most of the limbs; and Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The emergence of <b>the head</b> of a non-viable newborn <b>is</b> considered <b>like</b> the emergence of <b>most of the limbs. And they disagree with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel;</b> Rabbi Elazar holds in accordance with Shmuel’s opinion, whereas Rabbi Yoḥanan does not accept the opinion of Shmuel.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that if the fetus <b>emerged in pieces or</b> if it emerged <b>reversed, when most of its</b> limbs <b>emerge,</b> its status <b>is like</b> that of a child <b>born.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>From the fact that</b> the mishna <b>states: Or reversed, by inference</b> in the case of a fetus <b>that</b> emerged <b>in pieces</b> it emerged <b>in its proper manner,</b> i.e., the head first and then the body, <b>and</b> nevertheless the mishna <b>states</b> that it is only <b>when most of its</b> limbs <b>emerge</b> that its status <b>is like</b> that of a child <b>born.</b> This is <b>difficult for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> as he maintains that once the head emerges, the fetus is considered born.
The Gemara explains that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> could have <b>said to you: Say</b> that the mishna is referring to a case where the fetus <b>emerged in pieces and reversed,</b> whereas if it emerged with its head first, it is considered born even if most of its limbs did not emerge yet.
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> that the fetus emerged in pieces <b>or</b> reversed? If so, it cannot be explained as referring to a case where the fetus emerged both in pieces and reversed. The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> If the fetus <b>emerged in pieces or whole, and</b> in both <b>this</b> case <b>and that</b> case it emerged <b>reversed,</b> then <b>when most of its</b> limbs <b>emerge,</b> its status <b>is like</b> that of a child <b>born.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa says:</b> This dispute between Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yoḥanan is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is stated in a <i>baraita</i>: If the fetus <b>emerged in pieces or reversed, when most of its</b> limbs <b>emerge</b> its status <b>is like</b> that of a child <b>born. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> Its status is like that of a child born <b>when it emerges in its proper manner.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>saying?</b> His statement apparently indicates that if a fetus emerges with its feet first, then even after most of its limbs emerge it is not considered born.
<b>Rav Pappa says</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If the fetus <b>emerged in pieces or reversed, when most of its</b> limbs <b>emerge</b> its status <b>is like</b> that of a child <b>born; but</b> by inference, if the fetus emerged <b>in its proper manner,</b> then the emergence of <b>the head exempts</b> its twin, should it eventually be born first, from the obligations of primogeniture. And <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The status of a fetus that emerged in pieces is like that of a child born <b>when most of its</b> limbs <b>emerge,</b> provided that it emerged <b>in its proper manner,</b> i.e., both requirements are necessary. The suggestion is that the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan is in accordance with the ruling of the first <i>tanna</i>, that even if a fetus emerges in pieces, once its head emerges it is considered born; whereas the opinion of Rabbi Elazar follows the ruling of Rabbi Yosei that even if such a fetus emerges headfirst, it is not considered born.
<b>Rav Zevid objects to</b> Rav Pappa’s interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>: Since Rabbi Yosei issued his statement that both requirements are necessary, i.e., a majority of limbs and emergence in the proper manner, with regard to the two cases mentioned by the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>by inference in</b> the other case, <b>where</b> the fetus emerged <b>reversed, even</b> when <b>most of its</b> limbs emerge <b>it does not exempt</b> its twin from the obligations of primogeniture. But this is difficult, as <b>we maintain that the majority of</b> an item is considered <b>like all</b> of it. Accordingly, when most of the fetus’s limbs emerge it should be considered born even if it came out feetfirst.
<b>Rather, Rav Zevid says</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If the fetus <b>emerged in pieces and reversed, when most of its</b> limbs <b>emerge</b> its status <b>is like</b> that of a child <b>born; but</b> by inference, if the fetus emerged <b>in its proper manner</b> then the emergence of <b>the head exempts</b> its twin from the obligations of primogeniture, even if it was born in pieces. <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The fetus is considered born once its head emerges only in a case <b>when it emerges in its proper manner alive;</b> if it emerges in pieces, the fetus is considered born only when most of its limbs emerge.
<b>This</b> explanation <b>is also taught</b> explicitly in another <i>baraita</i>: If the fetus <b>emerged in pieces</b> and <b>reversed,</b> then <b>when most of its</b> limbs <b>emerge</b> its status <b>is like</b> that of a child <b>born; but</b> if the fetus emerged <b>in its proper manner,</b> the emergence of <b>the head exempts</b> its twin. <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The fetus is considered born once its head emerges only in a case <b>where it emerges in its proper manner alive.</b>
<b>And what is</b> the exact stage when a fetus that emerged <b>in its proper manner alive</b> is considered born? <b>When most of its head emerges. And what is</b> the stage when <b>most of its head</b> emerges? <b>Rabbi Yosei says: When its temples emerge. Abba Ḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua: When its forehead emerges. And some say: When the corners of its head,</b> i.e., the projection of the head above the neck, <b>are visible.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of a woman <b>who discharges and it is not known what is</b> the fetus’s sex, she <b>shall observe</b> the strictures of a woman who gave birth both <b>to a male and to a female.</b> She is impure for fourteen days, like a woman who gave birth to a female, and any blood the woman sees only until forty days after birth, not eighty days thereafter, is pure, like a woman who gave birth to a male. If <b>it is unknown whether it was</b> a male or female <b>offspring</b> or <b>whether</b> it was <b>not</b> an offspring at all, <b>she shall observe</b> the period of impurity <b>for</b> a woman who gave birth to <b>a male and for</b> a woman who gave birth to <b>a female; and for</b> any blood that she sees, she observes the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a menstruating woman.</b> Since it is possible that what she discharged was not an offspring at all, any blood she sees might be due to menstruation, not childbirth.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> With regard to a pregnant woman who <b>passed across a river and she discharged</b> her fetus into the river, and she does not know whether the fetus was fully formed, <b>she brings</b> the <b>offering</b> of a woman after childbirth, which is a burnt offering and a sin offering. <b>And</b> the sin offering, which is a bird, <b>is eaten</b> after the nape of its neck has been pinched, in the manner of a regular bird sin offering. This is the <i>halakha</i> despite the uncertainty that this fetus might not have been fully formed, in which case the woman would not be obligated to bring this offering, and a bird that is not an offering may not be eaten if its nape was pinched. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi explains the reasoning behind this ruling: One must <b>follow the majority of</b> pregnant <b>women, and most</b> pregnant <b>women give birth to full-fledged offspring.</b>
The Gemara analyzes this claim. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: If <b>it is unknown whether</b> what the woman discharged <b>was</b> a male or female <b>offspring</b> or whether it was not an offspring at all, <b>she shall observe</b> the period of impurity <b>for</b> a woman who gave birth to <b>a male and for</b> a woman who gave birth to <b>a female; and for</b> any blood that she sees, she observes the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a menstruating woman.</b> The Gemara asks: According to the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, <b>why must</b> the woman <b>observe</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a menstruating woman? Let us say</b> that one must <b>follow the majority of women, and the majority of women give birth to full-fledged offspring.</b> If so, she should observe a period of purity, during which any blood she sees is pure, after her period of impurity, like all women after childbirth.
The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> in <b>the mishna</b> is referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where</b> the woman <b>had not been presumed</b> to be <b>pregnant</b> prior to her miscarriage; <b>and when Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says</b> that a woman who discharges is presumed to have discharged an offspring, he was speaking of a case <b>where</b> the woman <b>had been presumed</b> to be <b>pregnant</b> prior to her miscarriage.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a difficulty with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi from a <i>baraita</i>: There is the case of a kosher <b>animal</b> that had not yet given birth, <b>which went</b> to the pasture <b>full,</b> i.e., pregnant, <b>and came</b> back the same day <b>empty,</b> i.e., with no live offspring.It clearly discharged, but it is unknown whether or not it discharged an offspring, which would exempt the animal’s subsequent offspring from the status of a firstborn. In this case, the offspring <b>that comes after it</b> is <b>a firstborn</b> of <b>uncertain</b> status.
The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> is this the <i>halakha</i>? According to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, one should <b>follow</b> the reality among <b>the majority of animals, and the majority of animals give birth to full-fledged offspring. And</b> if so, <b>this</b> subsequent offspring of the animal <b>is a regular</b> offspring, i.e., it is definitely not a firstborn.
<b>Ravina says</b> in response: In this case, the <i>halakha</i> does not follow the majority of animals, <b>because it can be said</b> that <b>the majority of animals give birth to an item that exempts</b> the animal’s subsequent offspring <b>from firstborn</b> status, <b>but a minority of</b> animals <b>give birth to an item that does not exempt</b> the animal’s subsequent offspring <b>from firstborn</b> status, i.e., an item that is not a full-fledged offspring. <b>And</b> an additional factor is that <b>all</b> animals <b>that give birth</b> to full-fledged offspring <b>discharge turbid liquids</b> one day before giving birth, <b>and since this</b> animal <b>did not discharge turbid liquids</b> before going to the pasture, <b>the</b> effect of the <b>majority is undermined.</b> Consequently, the status of the animal’s birth is uncertain, and for this reason its subsequent offspring is considered a firstborn of uncertain status.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If all</b> animals <b>that give birth</b> to full-fledged offspring <b>discharge turbid liquids</b> before giving birth, then it should be concluded <b>from</b> the fact <b>that this</b> animal <b>did not discharge turbid liquids</b> that it did not discharge a full-fledged offspring, and therefore the animal’s subsequent offspring <b>is a proper firstborn,</b> not a firstborn of uncertain status. <b>Rather,</b> one should <b>say</b> that Ravina meant the following: <b>The majority of</b> animals that <b>give birth discharge turbid liquids</b> beforehand, <b>and</b> therefore, <b>since this</b> animal <b>did not discharge turbid liquids, the</b> effect of the <b>majority is undermined.</b>
§ <b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said: Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi from the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a forgetful woman; but I do not know what the objection is.</b> The Gemara asks: This <i>halakha</i> of a forgetful woman, which forms the basis of the objection, <b>what is it?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:

Daf 29b

<b>A woman left</b> home for an extended period of time while she was <b>full,</b> i.e., pregnant, <b>and came</b> back when she was <b>empty,</b> as she discharged the fetus, but it is unknown exactly when and what she discharged; <b>and she spent three weeks in our presence</b> during which she was <b>pure,</b> i.e., she did not experience any bleeding, <b>and</b> for the following <b>ten weeks</b> she alternated between <b>one impure</b> week, in which she experienced bleeding every day, <b>and one pure</b> week, in which she did not experience bleeding at all.
In such a case, the woman <b>may engage in intercourse</b> with her husband at the end of the fifth week following her return, <b>on the eve of the thirty-fifth</b> day, after which she is again prohibited from engaging in intercourse with her husband. <b>And we require her to immerse</b> in a ritual bath a total of <b>ninety-five immersions.</b> This is <b>the statement of Beit Shammai. And Beit Hillel say</b> that she is required to immerse <b>thirty-five</b> times. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> She is required to immerse only once, as <b>it is sufficient for the immersion to be at the end</b> of the period when she is required to immerse every day. The entire <i>baraita</i> will be explained below.
The Gemara explains the objection from the <i>baraita</i> to the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: <b>Granted</b> in the <b>first week</b> following her arrival the woman <b>may not engage in intercourse</b> with her husband, despite the fact that she did not experience bleeding during that week, as one can <b>say</b> that perhaps <b>she is a woman who gave birth to a male</b> just before her arrival, which would mean that the first week is her seven-day period of impurity. Likewise, it is clear that the woman may not engage in intercourse with her husband during the <b>second week</b> after her arrival, as one can <b>say</b> that <b>she is a woman who gave birth to a female,</b> and consequently her period of impurity is two weeks long.
It is also clear why she may not engage in intercourse during the <b>third week,</b> as one can <b>say</b> that perhaps <b>she is a woman who gave birth to a female as a <i>zava</i>,</b> i.e., a woman who experienced a discharge of uterine blood after her menstrual period for three days without the pain of labor, and therefore assumed the status of a <i>zava</i> before giving birth. If so, she must count seven clean days after her two-week period of impurity, and subsequently immerse.
<b>But</b> in the <b>fourth week, even though</b> the woman <b>sees blood</b> during that period, <b>let her engage in intercourse</b> with her husband, <b>as it is pure blood.</b> At this stage the woman’s period of purity is certainly underway. Why does the <i>baraita</i> state that she may not engage in intercourse with her husband in this week? Is it <b>not due to</b> the concern <b>that</b> she might have discharged an item that was not a full-fledged offspring? Evidently, although most pregnant women give birth to full-fledged offspring, <b>we do not follow the majority,</b> which contradicts the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi.
The Gemara asks: <b>Rather,</b> as this is apparently a valid objection, <b>what</b> is the reason that Ravin said: <b>I do not know what the objection</b> to the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>is?</b> The Gemara explains: Perhaps it is in fact assumed that the woman gave birth to a full-fledged offspring, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, and the reason she is not considered pure in the fourth week after her arrival is that one can <b>say</b> that <b>her birth was distant,</b> i.e., she gave birth a long time before her arrival, and therefore her period of purity had already ended before the fourth week.
§ The Gemara further analyzes the above <i>baraita</i>: During <b>this fifth week, when</b> the woman <b>is pure,</b> as she did not experience any bleeding, <b>let her engage in intercourse</b> with her husband. Why is she permitted to do so only on the eve of the thirty-fifth day, at the end of the fifth week?
The Gemara answers: During <b>this fourth week,</b> when she experiences bleeding every day, <b>we are uncertain</b> with regard to <b>each and every day as</b> to whether it is <b>the end of</b> the woman’s period of purity as a woman after <b>childbirth, and that</b> it is therefore <b>the beginning of</b> the seven-day period that she must observe as <b>a menstruating woman. And</b> with regard to the <b>twenty-eighth</b> day <b>itself,</b> the last day of the fourth week, one can also <b>say</b> that <b>it is</b> after the last day of her period of purity and <b>the beginning of</b> her period as <b>a menstruating woman, and</b> therefore <b>she is required to observe seven</b> days <b>for her menstruation,</b> which end on the thirty-fourth day after her arrival. Consequently, the woman may engage in intercourse with her husband only on the eve of the thirty-fifth day.
The Gemara further inquires: As explained above, the reason it is prohibited for the woman to engage in intercourse during the third week is that she might have given birth just before arriving and had been a <i>zava</i> at the time, and therefore after observing the two weeks of impurity of a woman after childbirth, she must observe an additional seven days of impurity as a <i>zava</i>. A <i>zava</i> may undergo her purification process on the seventh day of her impurity, following which she is permitted to engage in intercourse. Accordingly, <b>let</b> the woman <b>engage in intercourse on</b> the <b>twenty-first</b> day after her arrival.
The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> in this <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who said</b> that <b>it is prohibited</b> for a woman <b>to do so,</b> i.e., to engage in intercourse on the seventh day of her <i>ziva</i> after immersing in a ritual bath, <b>lest she come to</b> a case of <b>uncertainty.</b> If she engages in intercourse on that seventh day after immersion, and subsequently experiences bleeding on that same day, it retroactively nullifies her entire seven clean days, and it turns out that she engaged in intercourse while she was impure. The Gemara continues to ask: Even so, <b>let her engage in intercourse that night,</b> after having completed seven clean days. The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>when</b> the woman <b>saw</b> blood <b>in the evening,</b> i.e., her fourth week of experiencing bleeding started in the nighttime.
§ The Gemara analyzes the statement of Beit Shammai: <b>And we require</b> the woman <b>to immerse</b> in a ritual bath for a total of <b>ninety-five immersions.</b> The Gemara explains: During <b>the first week she</b> is required <b>to immerse at night,</b> every night of the week. The reason is that as the date of her childbirth and the sex of the offspring are unknown, one can <b>say</b> that <b>she is a woman who gave birth to a male.</b> If so, the seven days of impurity might have ended on any night of the first week, and therefore she must immerse in a ritual bath on each night.
During the <b>second week, she</b> is required <b>to immerse at night,</b> every night, as one can <b>say</b> that <b>she is a woman who gave birth to a female,</b> and therefore it is possible that her fourteen-day period of impurity ended on any of the nights of the second week. She must also immerse every day of the second week <b>in the daytime,</b> as one can <b>say</b> that <b>she is a woman who gave birth to a male as a <i>zava</i>.</b> If so, it is possible that her seven-day period of impurity as a woman after childbirth ended on any given day during the first week, after which she must start to count seven clean days as a <i>zava</i>. These seven days necessarily culminate during the second week, and the <i>halakha</i> is that a woman must immerse in a ritual bath on the morning when her seven clean days of <i>ziva</i> conclude.
During the <b>third week, she</b> is required <b>to immerse</b> every day <b>in the daytime,</b> as one can <b>say</b> that <b>she is a woman who gave birth to a female as a <i>zava</i>,</b> and consequently her fourteen-day period of impurity as a woman after childbirth ended during the second week. Therefore, the woman’s seven clean days as a <i>zava</i> might end on any day of the third week, and she is obligated to immerse on that morning.
She is also required to immerse <b>on</b> every <b>night</b> of the third week, according to Beit Shammai. <b>Beit Shammai</b> conform <b>to their</b> line of <b>reasoning, as they say</b> in a mishna (71b) that a woman who finished her period of purity after childbirth, referred to as <b>a woman who immersed that long day</b> and is waiting for her purification process to be completed, <b>requires immersion</b> at the end of this period. The woman must therefore immerse on every night of the third week, in case that night is the end of her period of purity, for a total of thirty-five immersions by the end of the week. She must continue to immerse every night until her period of purity is certainly over, no matter when she gave birth, i.e., until the eightieth day since her arrival.

Daf 30a

The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> consider, <b>how many days of purity are there,</b> in the case of a woman who gave birth to a female? There are <b>sixty-six</b> days. Therefore, in order to account for all of the nights that might occur immediately after the woman’s period of purity, she must immerse on sixty-six nights, according to Beit Shammai. <b>Remove</b> from this sum the immersions of the <b>third week, when we require</b> the woman <b>to immerse</b> seven times, and <b>sixty less one are left.</b> These <b>sixty-less-one</b> times she immerses after the third week <b>and</b> the <b>thirty-five</b> times she immerses during the first three weeks <b>are</b> together <b>ninety-four</b> immersions. If so, those <b>ninety-five</b> immersions, required by Beit Shammai, <b>what is their purpose?</b> Why do they require an extra immersion?
<b>Rav Yirmeya of Difti says:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the woman <b>came before us,</b> i.e., she returned from her journey, <b>during twilight,</b> when it is halakhically uncertain whether it is day or night. The ruling is <b>that</b> in this case <b>we give her another immersion,</b> i.e., she is obligated to immerse on an additional day, in case she completed her days of impurity on the day she arrived, and that night is the night she must immerse.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Beit Hillel, who say</b> that <b>a woman who immersed that long day,</b> i.e., a woman observing her period of purity after childbirth, <b>does not require immersion</b> once her period of purity is over, those <b>thirty-five</b> immersions that they require, <b>what is their purpose?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Twenty-eight</b> immersions are required <b>as we said</b> above, i.e., due to the end of the period of impurity in case the woman gave birth to a male or to a female, and due to the completion of the woman’s seven clean days in case she gave birth as a <i>zava</i>. In addition, during <b>this fifth week we require</b> the woman <b>to immerse each and every night,</b> as one can <b>say</b> that <b>it is the end of</b> her seven-day period as <b>a menstruating woman.</b>
The Gemara raises a further difficulty: <b>Why do I</b> need the <i>baraita</i> to state that after the woman did not experience any bleeding for the first three weeks after arriving, she alternated for <b>ten weeks</b> between experiencing bleeding every day for a week and not experiencing any bleeding for a week. How does this detail contribute to Beit Shammai’s ruling that the woman must immerse ninety-five times? After all, <b>eight and a half</b> weeks <b>are sufficient.</b> Combined with the first three weeks after the woman’s arrival, this period amounts to eighty days, which is the number of days on which the woman must immerse according to Beit Shammai, as each day might be the last of her period of purity.
The Gemara answers: Although eight and a half weeks are sufficient, <b>since</b> the <i>baraita</i> must <b>teach half a week, it completes</b> that week, for a total of nine weeks. <b>And since</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> with regard to the ninth <b>week</b> that the woman is <b>impure, it also taught</b> with regard to the tenth <b>week</b> that the woman is <b>pure,</b> in accordance with the pattern of a week of purity following every week of impurity.
With regard to the opinion of Beit Hillel that the woman immerses only thirty-five times, the Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there the immersion</b> that the woman is obligated to perform <b>due to</b> the possibility that she is <b>a <i>zava</i>?</b> It is possible that by the fourth week, the woman’s period of purity after childbirth has already ended, and the bleeding she experiences that week is menstrual blood, in which case the next week that she sees blood renders her a <i>zava</i>. If so, she must immerse at the end of that week, after counting seven clean days. The same applies to all the other weeks on which she experiences bleeding, apart from the fourth. Consequently, there are additional immersions not counted by Beit Hillel.
The Gemara answers: Beit Hillel <b>count</b> only the times <b>that</b> the woman is obligated to immerse <b>before</b> she is permitted to engage in <b>intercourse</b> with her husband, which amount to thirty-five. They <b>do not count</b> the times <b>that</b> she must immerse <b>after</b> she is permitted to engage in <b>intercourse</b> with her husband.
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to Beit Shammai, who count</b> the times <b>that</b> the woman is obligated to immerse <b>after</b> she is permitted to engage in <b>intercourse</b> in their total of ninety-five immersions, <b>let them also count</b> those <b>immersions</b> in which the woman is obligated <b>due to</b> the possibility that she is <b>a <i>zava</i>.</b> The Gemara answers: Beit Shammai <b>deal with</b> immersions that are due to the woman’s <b>childbirth;</b> they do <b>not deal with</b> immersions that are due to the possibility of <b><i>ziva</i>.</b>
The Gemara questions this response: <b>But there are</b> immersions counted by Beit Shammai that are due to the possibility that she is <b>a woman who gave birth as a <i>zava</i>.</b> These immersions serve to purify the woman from her status as a <i>zava</i>, not as a woman after childbirth. The Gemara answers: Beit Shammai <b>count</b> immersions that are due to the possibility that she is <b>a woman who gave birth as a <i>zava</i>.</b> In such a scenario, immersion is delayed due to the childbirth, and is performed when the woman’s impurity period of <i>ziva</i> following childbirth is over. Therefore, these immersions are considered as connected to the childbirth. But Beit Shammai <b>do not count</b> immersions that are due to <b><i>ziva</i> alone.</b>
§ With regard to the statement of the <i>baraita</i> that the woman immerses on every night of the first week in case her period of impurity after childbirth just ended, the Gemara asks: Besides immersing on every night of <b>the first week after she came before us, let</b> the woman <b>immerse during the daytime</b> of every day of that week as well, <b>as perhaps</b> she is a <i>zava</i>, and on <b>each and every day</b> it is possible that <b>her counting</b> of clean days <b>are completed,</b> and she must therefore immerse that morning. Accordingly, seven more immersions should be added to the count.
The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> statement? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who said</b> that <b>we require</b> that the seven clean days of a <i>zava</i> must be <b>counted in our presence,</b> i.e., they must actually be counted. Since she did not know she should count before she arrived, she did not begin counting prior to her arrival. Therefore, her seven clean days begin only once she arrives, and she cannot immerse from her status as a <i>zava</i> of uncertain status before the end of the first week.
The Gemara raises a further difficulty: Even so, <b>let her immerse</b> at <b>the end of the first week,</b> on the morning of the seventh day, after counting seven clean days following her return. This adds one more immersion to the count. The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> <b>is not dealing with</b> immersions that the woman is obligated to perform <b>once a week.</b>
The Gemara further inquires: <b>Let</b> the woman <b>immerse</b> on <b>the first day that she came before us, as perhaps she is</b> a lesser <i>zava</i>, i.e., <b>a woman who</b> experienced a discharge of uterine blood after her menstrual period for one or two consecutive days, and who therefore <b>observes</b> a clean <b>day for a day</b> she experiences a discharge. The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> <b>is dealing with a greater <i>zava</i></b> alone, i.e., one who experienced a discharge for three consecutive days and must therefore count seven clean days before immersing; <b>it is not dealing with a lesser <i>zava</i>.</b>
§ The Gemara summarizes its analysis of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Conclude from it three</b> conclusions. <b>Conclude from it</b> that the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who said</b> that <b>we require</b> that the seven clean days of a <i>zava</i> must be <b>counted in our presence.</b>
<b>And conclude from it</b> that the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> that it is permitted in principle for a <i>zava</i> to engage in intercourse with her husband on her seventh clean day after immersing in a ritual bath, <b>but</b> that <b>the Sages said</b> that <b>it is prohibited</b> for her <b>to do so, lest she come to</b> a case of <b>uncertainty,</b> i.e., in case she experiences a discharge of blood after engaging in intercourse, which retroactively nullifies her entire seven clean days and renders her impure.
<b>And</b> finally, <b>conclude from it</b> that <b>immersion at its proper time is a mitzva,</b> which is why the woman immerses every day despite the fact it remains prohibited for her to engage in intercourse. <b>But Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: It is sufficient for the immersion to be at the end, and we do not say</b> that <b>immersion at its proper time is a mitzva</b> in its own right. Consequently, the woman is obligated to perform only one immersion.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A woman <b>who discharges on the fortieth day</b> since she immersed herself and engaged in intercourse with her husband need <b>not be concerned that</b> it might have been <b>an offspring</b> and she became impure with its miscarriage, as the formation of the offspring in the womb occurs only forty days after conception. But in the case of a woman who discharges <b>on the forty-first day</b> after immersion, there is concern that perhaps it was an offspring. Since its sex is unknown, <b>she shall observe</b> the period of impurity <b>for</b> a woman who gave birth to <b>a male and for</b> a woman who gave birth to <b>a female; and for</b> any blood that she sees, she observes the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a menstruating woman.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> A woman who discharges on the <b>forty-first day</b> after immersion <b>observes</b> the seven days of impurity <b>for</b> a woman who gave birth to <b>a male; and for</b> any blood that she sees after seven days, she observes the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a menstruating woman.</b> But a woman who discharges on the <b>eighty-first day</b> after immersion <b>observes</b> the strictures of a woman who gave birth both <b>to a male and to a female, and</b> also the strictures <b>of a menstruating woman, as</b> the formation of <b>the male</b> offspring <b>concludes on</b> the <b>forty-first</b> day <b>and</b> the formation of <b>the female</b> offspring concludes <b>on</b> the <b>eighty-first</b> day. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> With regard to <b>both the formation of the male and the formation of the female, this and that</b> conclude on the <b>forty-first</b> day.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara discusses the statement of the mishna that a woman who discharges on the forty-first day after immersion observes the strictures of a woman who gave birth to both a male and a female, and the strictures of a menstruating woman. <b>Why</b> are the strictures of a woman who gave birth to <b>a male mentioned</b> in this statement? What additional strictures must the woman observe due to the possibility that she gave birth to a male, over and above those she observes for the birth of a female?
<b>If</b> these strictures are mentioned due <b>to the days of impurity</b> that a woman who gave birth to a male must observe, <b>doesn’t</b> the mishna in any case <b>teach</b> that the woman observes the strictures of a woman who gave birth to <b>a female?</b> The seven days of impurity that are observed by a woman who gave birth to a male are included in the fourteen days of impurity that she observes for a female. <b>And if</b> these strictures are mentioned due <b>to the days of purity</b> that are observed by a woman who gave birth to a male, which are fewer than the days of purity that are observed for the birth of a female,

Daf 30b

<b>doesn’t</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> that the woman observes the strictures of <b>a menstruating woman,</b> i.e., she is considered ritually impure every time she experiences bleeding, and does not observe any period of purity at all?
The Gemara answers: The mishna mentions that the woman observes the strictures of a woman who gave birth to a male to teach <b>that if she sees</b> blood on the <b>thirty-fourth day</b> after her miscarriage <b>and again sees</b> blood on the <b>forty-first day,</b> her purity status <b>shall be ruined,</b> i.e., she shall be prohibited from engaging in intercourse, <b>until</b> the <b>forty-eighth</b> day. If she were not observing the strictures of a woman who gave birth to a male, but only those of a menstruating woman and one who gave birth to a female, she would not have to wait seven days after seeing blood on the forty-first day. Instead, she would wait only one day, as her possible seven-day period of menstruation began on the thirty-fourth day and ended on the fortieth. Yet, as she might have given birth to a male, the forty-first day might be the first day after her period of purity, and therefore the first of her seven days of menstruation. Consequently, she must consider herself impure until the forty-eighth day.
<b>And similarly, with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> that she observes the strictures of a woman who gave birth to <b>a female,</b> one ramification is <b>that if she sees</b> blood on the <b>seventy-fourth day and again sees</b> blood on the <b>eighty-first day,</b> her purity status <b>shall be ruined until</b> the <b>eighty-eighth</b> day. Although she observes ritual impurity after discovering bleeding on the seventy-fourth day, as perhaps she has the status of a menstruating woman, when she discovers bleeding on the eighty-first day she must begin the count of seven days of menstruation again, in case the seventy-fourth day was during her period of purity after having given birth to a female.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> A woman who discharges on the <b>forty-first day</b> after immersion <b>observes</b> both the strictures of a woman who gave birth <b>to a male, and</b> those <b>of a menstruating woman,</b> but not the strictures of a woman who gave birth to a female, as the formation of a male offspring takes forty-one days, whereas the formation of a female offspring takes eighty-one days. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yishmael says,</b> in explanation of his opinion: <b>In</b> the case of a woman who gave birth to <b>a male,</b> the verse <b>deems</b> her <b>impure</b> for seven days <b>and deems</b> her <b>pure</b> for an additional thirty-three days, for a total of forty days; <b>and with regard to</b> a woman who gave birth to <b>a female,</b> the verse <b>deems</b> her <b>impure</b> for fourteen days <b>and deems</b> her <b>pure</b> for another sixty-six days, for a total of eighty days.
It can therefore be inferred that <b>just as when</b> the verse <b>deems</b> a woman <b>impure and</b> then <b>deems</b> her <b>pure</b> for a total of forty days <b>in</b> the case of <b>a male, its</b> amount of time <b>is parallel to</b> the time of <b>the formation of</b> a male embryo; <b>so too, when</b> the verse <b>deems</b> a woman <b>impure and deems</b> her <b>pure</b> for a total of eighty days <b>in</b> the case of <b>a female, its</b> amount of time <b>is parallel to</b> the time of <b>the formation of</b> a female embryo. Accordingly, the formation of a female ends on the eighty-first day after conception. The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yishmael in response: <b>One cannot derive</b> the amount of time of the <b>formation</b> of an embryo <b>from</b> the extent of a woman’s period of <b>impurity</b> after giving birth.
Furthermore, the Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Yishmael</b> that there is a proof against his opinion from <b>an incident involving Cleopatra, Queen of Alexandria. Since her maidservants were sentenced to death by the government, she</b> took advantage of the opportunity and <b>experimented on them</b> in order to examine the amount of time it takes for an embryo to develop. She had her maidservants engage in intercourse and operated on them following their execution in order to determine the stage at which an embryo is fully formed, <b>and found</b> that both in <b>this</b> case, when the embryo is male, <b>and that</b> case, when it is female, the formation is complete <b>on the forty-first</b> day after conception. Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to them</b> in response: <b>I bring you proof from the Torah, and you bring me proof from the fools?</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What proof from the Torah</b> does Rabbi Yishmael bring for his opinion? <b>If we say</b> that his proof is the aforementioned derivation that <b>in</b> the case of a woman who gave birth to <b>a male,</b> the verse <b>deems</b> her <b>impure</b> for seven days <b>and deems</b> her <b>pure</b> for an additional thirty-three days, for a total of forty days; <b>and in</b> the case of <b>a female,</b> the verse <b>deems</b> her <b>impure</b> for fourteen days <b>and deems</b> her <b>pure</b> for an additional sixty-six days, for a total of eighty days, <b>didn’t</b> the Rabbis <b>say to him</b> in response that <b>one cannot derive</b> the amount of time that the <b>formation</b> of an embryo takes <b>from</b> the extent of a woman’s period of <b>impurity</b> after giving birth?
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yishmael’s derivation is that <b>the verse states:</b> “If a woman bears seed and gives birth to a male…and if <b>she gives birth</b> to a female” (Leviticus 12:2–5). <b>The verse adds another</b> explicit mention of <b>childbirth with regard to a female,</b> besides the mention of childbirth in the case of a male, when it could have simply stated: And if it is a female. Rabbi Yishmael derives from here that not only are the periods of ritual impurity and purity of one who gives birth to a female double those of a woman who gives birth to a male, but the formation of a female embryo also takes twice the time.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> for <b>what</b> reason does Rabbi Yishmael refer to the proof that the Rabbis cited from Cleopatra’s experiment as <b>a proof from the fools?</b> The Gemara answers: One can <b>say</b> that the maidservant who was pregnant with <b>a female</b> embryo <b>became pregnant first, forty days before</b> the maidservant who was pregnant with <b>a male</b> embryo. Consequently, it took the female embryo eighty days to be develop, not forty.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how would <b>the Rabbis</b> respond to this claim? The Gemara answers: Cleopatra <b>gave</b> the maidservants <b>a purgative medicine to drink</b> before they engaged in intercourse, which would have terminated any previous pregnancy. <b>And Rabbi Yishmael</b> would respond that <b>there are bodies that are not affected by</b> this <b>medicine,</b> i.e., certain pregnancies are not terminated by the medicine. Consequently, the maidservant who was pregnant with a female embryo might have been pregnant prior to the experiment.
The Gemara cites another <i>baraita</i> that presents a different version of this exchange between Rabbi Yishmael and the Rabbis: <b>Rabbi Yishmael said to</b> the Rabbis that there is a proof for his opinion from <b>an incident involving Cleopatra, the Greek queen, as her maidservants were sentenced to death by the government, and she experimented on them and found</b> that <b>a male</b> embryo is fully formed <b>on the forty-first</b> day after conception, <b>and a female</b> embryo is formed <b>on the eighty-first</b> day. The Rabbis <b>said to him: One does not bring proof from the fools.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> the Rabbis consider this a proof from the fools? They claim that it is possible that <b>this</b> woman <b>who</b> was pregnant with <b>a female</b> embryo did not conceive when Cleopatra had her engage in intercourse; rather, she <b>waited forty days, and then became pregnant</b> when she again engaged in intercourse. Therefore, the embryo was formed in forty days.
<b>And</b> how would <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> respond to this claim? He would claim that the maidservants could not have conceived on a later date, as Cleopatra <b>transferred them to</b> the custody of <b>a steward,</b> who made sure that they did not engage in intercourse during the experiment. <b>And the Rabbis</b> would say that <b>there is no steward [<i>apotropos</i>] for</b> restraining <b>sexual intercourse,</b> and therefore one can <b>say</b> that the <b>warden himself engaged in intercourse with</b> the maidservant.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to Rabbi Yishmael’s proof: <b>But</b> how can one be sure that the female embryo was formed after eighty-one days? <b>Perhaps if</b> the womb <b>of</b> the woman carrying <b>this female</b> embryo <b>would have been torn</b> open <b>on the forty-first</b> day after conception, the female embryo <b>would have</b> already <b>been found</b> in it, <b>just as</b> in the case of <b>a male</b> embryo. <b>Abaye says</b> in response: It was a case <b>where the indications of</b> the ages of the two embryos, e.g., their hairs and fingernails, <b>were identical.</b> Evidently, the female embryo developed in eighty days to the same degree that the male embryo developed in forty days.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And the Rabbis say: Both the formation of the male and the formation of the female</b> conclude on the forty-first day. The Gemara asks: The statement of <b>the Rabbis is</b> identical to the statement of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>.</b> Why does the mishna repeat this opinion in the name of the Rabbis?
<b>And if you would say</b> that the purpose is <b>to</b> teach that <b>the unattributed</b> opinion mentioned in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and</b> therefore it is the <i>halakha</i>, as when there is a disagreement between <b>an individual</b> Sage <b>and many</b> Sages, the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of the <b>many,</b> this cannot be the reason. The Gemara explains: It is <b>obvious</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the unattributed opinion mentioned in the first clause of the mishna, as this is a general halakhic principle.
The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>from</b> the fact that <b>the explanation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael stands to reason, as the verses</b> apparently <b>support it,</b> the <i>halakha</i> should be in accordance with his opinion, therefore the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the majority of Sages agree with the unattributed opinion mentioned in the first clause of the mishna.
§ <b>Rabbi Samlai taught: To what is a fetus in its mother’s womb comparable? To a folded notebook [<i>lefinkas</i>]. And it rests with its hands on its two sides</b> of its head, at the temples, <b>its two arms [<i>atzilav</i>] on its two knees, and its two heels on its two buttocks, and its head rests between its knees, and its mouth is closed, and its umbilicus is open. And it eats from what its mother eats, and it drinks from what its mother drinks, and it does not emit excrement lest it kill its mother. But once it emerges into the airspace of the world, the closed</b> limb, i.e., its mouth, <b>opens, and the open</b> limb, its umbilicus, <b>closes, as otherwise it cannot live</b> for <b>even one hour.</b>
<b>And a candle is lit for it above its head, and it gazes from one end of the world to the other, as it is stated: “When His lamp shined above my head, and by His light I walked through darkness”</b> (Job 29:3). <b>And do not wonder</b> how one can see from one end of the world to the other, <b>as a person can sleep here,</b> in this location, <b>and see a dream</b> that takes place <b>in</b> a place as distant as <b>Spain [<i>beAspamya</i>].</b>
<b>And there are no days when a person is in a more blissful state than those days</b> when he is a fetus in his mother’s womb, <b>as it is stated</b> in the previous verse: <b>“If only I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me”</b> (Job 29:2). <b>And</b> the proof that this verse is referring to gestation is as follows: <b>Which are</b> the <b>days that have months but do not have years? You must say</b> that <b>these are</b> the <b>months of gestation.</b>
<b>And</b> a fetus <b>is taught the entire Torah</b> while in the womb, <b>as it is stated: “And He taught me and said to me: Let your heart hold fast My words; keep My commandments, and live”</b> (Proverbs 4:4). <b>And it</b> also <b>states:</b> “As I was in the days of my youth, <b>when the converse of God was upon my tent”</b> (Job 29:4).
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the purpose of the statement: <b>And it</b> also <b>states:</b> “When the converse of God was upon my tent”? Why is it necessary to cite this verse in addition to the previously quoted verse from Proverbs? The Gemara explains: <b>And if you would say</b> that the verse in Proverbs is insufficient, as <b>it is a prophet who is saying</b> that he was taught the entire Torah in his mother’s womb, but this does not apply to ordinary people, <b>come</b> and <b>hear</b> the verse in Job: <b>“When the converse of God was upon my tent.”</b>
<b>And once</b> the fetus <b>emerges into the airspace of the world, an angel comes and slaps it on its mouth, causing it to forget the entire Torah, as it is stated: “Sin crouches at the entrance”</b> (Genesis 4:7), i.e., when a person enters the world he is immediately liable to sin due to his loss of Torah knowledge.
<b>And</b> a fetus <b>does not leave</b> the womb <b>until</b> the angels <b>administer an oath to it, as it is stated: “That to Me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear”</b> (Isaiah 45:23). The verse is interpreted as follows: <b>“That to Me every knee shall bow”; this is</b> referring to <b>the day of</b> one’s <b>death, as it is stated: “All those who go down to the dust shall kneel before Him”</b> (Psalms 22:30). <b>“Every tongue shall swear”; this is</b> referring to <b>the day of</b> one’s <b>birth, as it is stated</b> in description of a righteous person: <b>“He who has clean hands, and a pure heart, who has not taken My name in vain, and has not sworn deceitfully”</b> (Psalms 24:4), i.e., he has kept the oath that he took before he was born.
<b>And what is the oath that</b> the angels <b>administer to</b> the fetus? <b>Be righteous and do not be wicked. And even</b> if <b>the entire world says to you: You are righteous, consider yourself wicked. And know that the Holy One, Blessed be He, is pure, and His ministers are pure, and the soul that He gave you is pure. If you preserve it in</b> a state of <b>purity,</b> all is <b>well, but if</b> you do <b>not</b> keep it pure, <b>I,</b> the angel, <b>shall take it from you.</b>
<b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught a parable:</b> This matter is comparable <b>to a priest who gave <i>teruma</i>,</b> the portion of the produce designated for the priest, <b>to one who is unreliable with regard to ritual impurity [<i>am ha’aretz</i>],</b> and therefore it is suspected that he might not maintain the purity of the <i>teruma</i>. <b>And</b> the priest <b>said to him: If you keep it in</b> a state of <b>ritual purity,</b> all is <b>well, but if</b> you do <b>not</b> keep it pure, <b>I shall burn it before you.</b>
<b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b>

Daf 31a

<b>What is the verse</b> from which it is derived that a fetus is administered an oath on the day of its birth? “Upon You I have relied from birth; <b>You are He Who took me out [<i>gozi</i>] of my mother’s womb”</b> (Psalms 71:6). <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> word: <b>“<i>Gozi</i>,” is a term of administering an oath? As it is written: “Cut off [<i>gozi</i>] your hair and cast it away”</b> (Jeremiah 7:29), which is interpreted as a reference to the vow of a nazirite, who must cut off his hair at the end of his term of naziriteship.
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says: To what is a fetus in its mother’s womb comparable?</b> It is comparable <b>to a nut placed in a basin</b> full <b>of water,</b> floating on top of the water. If <b>a person puts his finger on top of</b> the nut, <b>it sinks</b> either <b>in this direction or in that direction.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: During <b>the first three months</b> of pregnancy, the <b>fetus resides in the lower compartment</b> of the womb; in the <b>middle</b> three months, the <b>fetus resides in the middle compartment;</b> and during the <b>last</b> three months of pregnancy the <b>fetus resides in the upper compartment. And once its time to emerge arrives, it turns upside down and emerges; and this is</b> what causes <b>labor pains.</b>
With regard to the assertion that labor pains are caused by the fetus turning upside down, the Gemara notes: <b>And this is</b> the explanation for <b>that which we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The labor pains experienced by</b> a woman who gives birth to <b>a female are greater than</b> those <b>experienced by</b> a woman who gives birth to <b>a male.</b> The Gemara will explain this below.
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says: What is the verse</b> from which it is derived that a fetus initially resides in the lower part of the womb? <b>“When I was made in secret, and I was woven together in the lowest parts of the earth”</b> (Psalms 139:15). Since it <b>is not stated: I resided</b> in the lowest parts of the earth, <b>but rather: “I was woven together</b> in the lowest parts of the earth,” this teaches that during the initial stage of a fetus’s development, when it is woven together, its location is in the lower compartment of the womb.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>the labor pains experienced by</b> a woman who gives birth to <b>a female,</b> that they <b>are greater than those experienced by</b> a woman who gives birth to <b>a male?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> one, a male fetus, <b>emerges in the manner in which it engages in intercourse.</b> Just as a male engages in intercourse facing downward, so too, it is born while facing down. <b>And that</b> one, a female fetus, <b>emerges in the manner in which it engages in intercourse,</b> i.e., facing upward. Consequently, <b>that</b> one, a female fetus, <b>turns its face around</b> before it is born, <b>but this</b> one, a male fetus, <b>does not turn its face around</b> before it is born.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: During <b>the first three months</b> of pregnancy, <b>sexual intercourse is difficult</b> and harmful <b>for the woman and is also difficult for the offspring.</b> During the <b>middle</b> three months, intercourse is <b>difficult for the woman but is beneficial for the offspring.</b> During the <b>last</b> three months, sexual intercourse is <b>beneficial for the woman and beneficial for the offspring; as a result of it the offspring is found to be strong and fair skinned.</b>
The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who engages in intercourse</b> with his wife <b>on the ninetieth day</b> of her pregnancy, <b>it is as though he spills</b> her <b>blood.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>How does one know</b> that it is the ninetieth day of her pregnancy? <b>Rather, Abaye says: One should go ahead and engage in intercourse</b> with his wife even if it might be the ninetieth day, <b>and</b> rely on God to prevent any ensuing harm, as the verse states: <b>“The Lord preserves the simple”</b> (Psalms 116:6).
§ <b>The Sages taught: There are three partners in</b> the creation of <b>a person: The Holy One, Blessed be He, and his father, and his mother. His father emits the white seed, from which</b> the following body parts are formed: The <b>bones,</b> the <b>sinews,</b> the <b>nails,</b> the <b>brain that is in its head, and</b> the <b>white of the eye. His mother emits red seed, from which</b> are formed the <b>skin,</b> the <b>flesh,</b> the <b>hair, and</b> the <b>black of the eye. And the Holy One, Blessed be He, inserts into him a spirit, a soul,</b> his <b>countenance [<i>ukelaster</i>], eyesight, hearing of the ear,</b> the capability of <b>speech</b> of <b>the mouth,</b> the capability of <b>walking</b> with <b>the legs, understanding, and wisdom.</b>
<b>And when</b> a person’s <b>time to depart from the world arrives, the Holy One, Blessed be He, retrieves His part, and He leaves the part of</b> the person’s <b>father and mother before them. Rav Pappa said: This</b> is in accordance with the adage <b>that people say: Remove the salt</b> from a piece of meat, <b>and</b> you may then <b>toss the meat to a dog,</b> as it has become worthless.
§ <b>Rav Ḥinnana bar Pappa taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Who does great deeds beyond comprehension, wondrous deeds without number”</b> (Job 9:10)? <b>Come and see that the attribute of flesh and blood is unlike the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He. The attribute of flesh and blood</b> is that if one <b>puts an article in a flask,</b> even if the flask is <b>tied and its opening</b> faces <b>upward, it is uncertain whether</b> the item <b>is preserved</b> from getting lost, <b>and it is uncertain whether it is not preserved</b> from being lost. <b>But the Holy One, Blessed be He, forms the fetus in a woman’s open womb, and its opening</b> faces <b>downward, and</b> yet the fetus <b>is preserved.</b>
<b>Another matter</b> that demonstrates the difference between the attributes of God and the attributes of people is that when <b>a person places his articles on a scale</b> to be measured, <b>the heavier</b> the item <b>is,</b> the more <b>it descends. But</b> when <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> forms a fetus, <b>the heavier the offspring gets,</b> the more <b>it ascends upward</b> in the womb.
<b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “I will give thanks to You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; wonderful are Your works, and that my soul knows very well”</b> (Psalms 139:14)? <b>Come and see that the attribute of flesh and blood is unlike the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He. The attribute of flesh and blood</b> is that when <b>a person plants seeds</b> of different species <b>in</b> one <b>garden bed, each and every one</b> of the seeds <b>emerges</b> as a grown plant <b>according to its species. But the Holy One, Blessed be He, forms the fetus in a woman’s womb, and all of</b> the seeds, i.e., those of both the father and the mother, <b>emerge</b> when the offspring is formed <b>as one</b> sex.
<b>Alternatively,</b> when <b>a dyer puts herbs in a cauldron [<i>leyora</i>], they all emerge as one color</b> of dye, <b>whereas the Holy One, Blessed be He, forms the fetus in a woman’s womb,</b> and <b>each and every one</b> of the seeds <b>emerges as its own type.</b> In other words, the seed of the father form distinct elements, such as the white of the eye, and the seed of the mother forms other elements, such as the black of the eye, as explained above.
<b>Rav Yosef taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “And on that day you shall say: <b>I will give thanks to You, Lord, for You were angry with me; Your anger is turned away, and You comfort me”</b> (Isaiah 12:1)? <b>With regard to what</b> matter <b>is the verse speaking?</b>
It is referring, for example, <b>to two people who left</b> their homes to go <b>on a business</b> trip. <b>A thorn penetrated</b> the body <b>of one of them,</b> and he was consequently unable to go with his colleague. <b>He started blaspheming and cursing</b> in frustration. <b>After a period of time, he heard that the ship of the other</b> person <b>had sunk in the sea,</b> and realized that the thorn had saved him from death. He then <b>started thanking</b> God <b>and praising</b> Him for his delivery due to the slight pain caused to him by the thorn. This is the meaning of the statement: I will give thanks to You, Lord, for You were angry with me. <b>Therefore, it is stated</b> at the end of the verse: <b>“Your anger is turned away, and You comfort me.”</b>
<b>And this</b> statement <b>is</b> identical to <b>that which Rabbi Elazar said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, <b>Who does wondrous things alone; and blessed be His glorious name forever”</b> (Psalms 72:18–19)? What does it mean that God “does wondrous things alone”? It means that <b>even the one for whom the miracle was performed does not recognize the miracle</b> that was performed for <b>him.</b>
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “You measure [<i>zerita</i>] my going about [<i>orḥi</i>] and my lying down [<i>riv’i</i>], and are acquainted with all my ways”</b> (Psalms 139:3)? This verse <b>teaches that a person is not created from the entire drop</b> of semen, <b>but from its clear</b> part. <i>Zerita</i> can mean to winnow, while <i>orḥi</i> and <i>riv’i</i> can both be explained as references to sexual intercourse. Therefore the verse is interpreted homiletically as saying that God separates the procreative part of the semen from the rest. <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught a parable:</b> This matter is comparable <b>to a person who winnows</b> grain <b>in the granary; he takes the food and leaves the waste.</b>
This is <b>in accordance with</b> a statement <b>of Rabbi Abbahu, as Rabbi Abbahu raises a contradiction: It is written</b> in one of King David’s psalms: <b>“For You have girded me [<i>vatazreni</i>] with strength for battle”</b> (II Samuel 22:40), without the letter <i>alef</i> in <i>vatazreni</i>; <b>and it is written</b> in another psalm: <b>“Who girds me [<i>hame’azreni</i>] with strength”</b> (Psalms 18:33), with an <i>alef</i> in <i>hame’azreini</i>. What is the difference between these two expressions? <b>David said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, You selected me [<i>zeiritani</i>],</b> i.e., You separated between the procreative part and the rest of the semen in order to create me, <b>and You have girded me [<i>zeraztani</i>] with strength.</b>
<b>Rabbi Abbahu taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> in Balaam’s blessing: <b>“Who has counted the dust of Jacob, or numbered the stock [<i>rova</i>] of Israel”</b> (Numbers 23:10)? The verse <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, sits and counts the times that the Jewish people engage in intercourse [<i>revi’iyyoteihem</i>],</b> anticipating the time <b>when the drop from which the righteous person will be created will arrive.</b>
<b>And</b> it was <b>due to this matter</b> that <b>the eye of wicked Balaam went blind. He said: Should</b> God, <b>who is pure and holy, and whose ministers are pure and holy, peek at this matter? Immediately his eye was blinded</b> as a divine punishment, <b>as it is written: “The saying of the man whose eye is shut”</b> (Numbers 24:3).
<b>And this</b> statement <b>is</b> the same as that <b>which Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written,</b> with regard to Leah’s conceiving Issachar: <b>“And he lay with her that night”</b> (Genesis 30:16)? The verse <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, contributed to that act.</b> The manner in which God contributed to this act is derived from another verse, <b>as it is stated: “Issachar is a large-boned [<i>garem</i>] donkey”</b> (Genesis 49:14). This teaches that God directed Jacob’s <b>donkey</b> toward Leah’s tent so that he would engage in intercourse with her, thereby <b>causing [<i>garam</i>]</b> Leah’s conceiving <b>Issachar.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami says:</b> The sex of a fetus is determined at the moment of conception. If the <b>woman emits seed first, she gives birth to a male,</b> and if the <b>man emits seed first, she gives birth to a female, as it is stated: “If a woman bears seed and gives birth to a male”</b> (Leviticus 12:2).
<b>The Sages taught: At first,</b> people <b>would say</b> that if the <b>woman emits seed first she gives birth to a male,</b> and if the <b>man emits seed first, she gives birth to a female. But the Sages did not explain</b> from which verse this <b>matter</b> is derived, <b>until Rabbi Tzadok came and explained</b> that <b>it</b> is derived from the following verse: <b>“These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram, with his daughter Dinah”</b> (Genesis 46:15). From the fact that the verse <b>attributes the males to the females,</b> as the males are called: The sons of Leah, <b>and</b> it attributes <b>the females to the males,</b>in that Dinah is called: His daughter, it is derived that if the woman emits seed first she gives birth to a male, whereas if the man emits seed first, she bears a female.
This statement is also derived from the following verse: <b>“And the sons of Ulam were mighty men of valor, archers, and had many sons and sons’ sons”</b> (I Chronicles 8:40). <b>Is it in a person’s power to have many sons and sons’ sons? Rather, because</b>

Daf 31b

<b>they delay</b> while <b>in</b> their wives’ <b>abdomen,</b> initially refraining from emitting semen <b>so that their wives will emit seed first,</b> in order <b>that their children will be male, the verse ascribes them</b> credit <b>as though they have many sons and sons’ sons. And this</b> statement <b>is</b> the same as that <b>which Rav Ketina said: I could have made all of my children males,</b> by refraining from emitting seed until my wife emitted seed first. <b>Rava says</b> another method through which one can cause his children to be males: <b>One who wishes to make all of his children males should engage in intercourse</b> with his wife <b>and repeat</b> the act.
§ <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami says: A woman becomes pregnant only</b> by engaging in intercourse <b>close to the onset of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle, as it is stated: “Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity”</b> (Psalms 51:7). This iniquity is referring to intercourse close to the woman’s menstrual cycle, when intercourse is prohibited. Accordingly, David is saying that his mother presumably conceived him at this time.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> A woman becomes pregnant only by engaging in intercourse <b>near</b> the time of her <b>immersion</b> in a ritual bath, through which she is purified from her status as a menstruating woman, <b>as it is stated</b> in the continuation of the same verse: <b>“And in sin [<i>uvḥet</i>] did my mother conceive me”</b> (Psalms 51:7).
The Gemara explains this derivation: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this term “<i>ḥet</i>” is</b> a reference <b>to purity?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written</b> with regard to leprosy of houses: <b>“<i>Veḥittei</i> the house”</b> (Leviticus 14:52), <b>and we translate</b> the verse into Aramaic as: <b>And he shall purify the house. And if you wish, say</b> that the interpretation is derived <b>from here: “Purge me [<i>teḥatte’eni</i>] with hyssop, and I shall be pure”</b> (Psalms 51:9). Evidently, the root <i>ḥet</i>, <i>tet</i>, <i>alef</i> refers to purification.
§ <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami says: When a male comes into the world,</b> i.e., when a male baby is born, <b>peace comes to the world, as it is stated: “Send the lambs [<i>khar</i>] for the ruler of the land”</b> (Isaiah 16:1). This <i>khar</i>, or <i>kar</i>, a gift one sends the ruler, contributes to the stability of the government and peace, and the word <b>male [<i>zakhar</i>]</b> can be interpreted homiletically as an abbreviation of: <b>This is a <i>kar</i> [<i>zeh kar</i>].</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak from the school of Rabbi Ami says: When a male comes into the world, his loaf</b> of bread, i.e., his sustenance, <b>comes into his possession.</b> In other words, a male can provide for himself. This is based on the aforementioned interpretation of the word <b>male [<i>zakhar</i>]</b> as an abbreviation of: <b>This is a <i>kar</i> [<i>zeh kar</i>],</b> and the term <i>kar</i> refers to sustenance, <b>as it is written: “And he prepared great provision [<i>kera</i>] for them”</b> (II Kings 6:23).
By contrast, <b>when a female comes into the world, nothing,</b> i.e., no sustenance, comes <b>with her.</b> This is derived from the homiletic interpretation of the word <b>female [<i>nekeva</i>]</b> as an abbreviation of the phrase: <b>She comes clean [<i>nekiya ba’a</i>],</b> i.e., empty. Furthermore, <b>until she says:</b> Give me <b>sustenance,</b> people <b>do not give her, as it is written</b> in Laban’s request of Jacob: <b>“Appoint me [<i>nokva</i>] your wages, and I will give it”</b> (Genesis 30:28). Laban used the word <i>nokva</i>, similar to <i>nekeva</i>, when he said that he would pay Jacob only if he explicitly demanded his wages.
<b>The students of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai asked him: For what</b> reason <b>does the Torah say</b> that <b>a woman after childbirth brings an offering? He said to them: At the time that</b> a woman <b>crouches to give birth,</b> her pain is so great that <b>she impulsively takes an oath that she will not engage in intercourse with her husband</b> ever again, so that she will never again experience this pain. <b>Therefore, the Torah says</b> that <b>she must bring an offering</b> for violating her oath and continuing to engage in intercourse with her husband.
<b>Rav Yosef objects to this</b> answer: <b>But isn’t</b> the woman <b>an intentional violator</b> of her oath? <b>And</b> if she wishes that her oath be dissolved, so that she may engage in intercourse with her husband, <b>the matter depends on</b> her <b>regret</b> of her oath. One is obligated to bring an offering for violating an oath of an utterance only if his transgression is unwitting. <b>And furthermore,</b> if the purpose of the offering that a woman brings after childbirth is to atone for violating an oath, then <b>she</b> should be <b>required to bring</b> a female lamb or goat as <b>an offering,</b> which is the requirement of one who violated <b>an oath,</b> rather than the bird offering brought by a woman after childbirth.
<b>And</b> the students of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai further inquired of him: <b>For what</b> reason <b>does the Torah say</b> that a woman who gives birth to <b>a male</b> is ritually impure <b>for seven</b> days, <b>but</b> a woman who gives birth to <b>a female</b> is impure <b>for fourteen</b> days? Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai answered them: When a woman gives birth to <b>a male, over which everyone is happy, she regrets</b> her oath, that she will never again engage in intercourse with her husband, already <b>seven</b> days after giving birth. By contrast, after giving birth to <b>a female, over which everyone is unhappy, she regrets</b> her oath only <b>fourteen</b> days after giving birth.
<b>And</b> the students further asked him: <b>For what</b> reason <b>does the Torah say</b> that <b>circumcision</b> is performed only <b>on the eighth</b> day of the baby’s life, and not beforehand? He answered them: It is <b>so that</b> there <b>will not be</b> a situation where <b>everyone</b> is <b>happy</b> at the circumcision ceremony <b>but the father and mother of</b> the infant <b>are unhappy,</b> as they are still prohibited from engaging in intercourse.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: For what</b> reason <b>does the Torah say</b> that <b>a menstruating woman</b> is prohibited from engaging in intercourse with her husband <b>for seven</b> days? It is <b>because</b> if a woman were permitted to engage in intercourse with her husband all the time, her husband would be too <b>accustomed to her, and</b> would eventually be <b>repulsed by her.</b> Therefore, <b>the Torah says</b> that a menstruating woman <b>shall be ritually impure</b> for <b>seven days,</b> during which she is prohibited from engaging in intercourse with her husband, <b>so that</b> when she becomes pure again <b>she will be dear to her husband as</b> at <b>the time when she entered the wedding canopy</b> with him.
§ <b>The students of Rabbi Dostai, son of Rabbi Yannai, asked him: For what</b> reason is it the norm that <b>a man pursues a woman</b> for marriage, <b>but a woman does not pursue a man?</b> Rabbi Dostai answered them by citing <b>a parable of a person who lost an item. Who searches for what?</b> Certainly <b>the owner of the lost item searches for his item;</b> the item does not search for its owner. Since the first woman was created from the body of the first man, the man seeks that which he has lost.
<b>And</b> the students of Rabbi Dostai further asked him: <b>For what</b> reason does <b>a man</b> engage in intercourse <b>facing down, and a woman</b> engage in intercourse <b>facing up toward the man?</b> Rabbi Dostai answered them: <b>This</b> man faces <b>the place from which he was created,</b> i.e., the earth, <b>and that</b> woman faces <b>the place from which she was created,</b> namely man.
<b>And</b> the students also inquired: <b>For what</b> reason is <b>a man</b> who is angry likely to <b>accept appeasement, but a woman</b> is <b>not</b> as likely to <b>accept appeasement?</b> Rabbi Dostai answered them: It is <b>because this</b> man behaves like <b>the place from which he was created,</b> i.e., the earth, which yields to pressure, <b>and that</b> woman behaves like <b>the place from which she was created,</b> i.e., from bone, which cannot be molded easily.
The students continued to ask Rabbi Dostai: <b>For what</b> reason <b>is a woman’s voice pleasant, but a man’s voice is not pleasant?</b> He answered: <b>This</b> man is similar to <b>the place from which he was created,</b> the earth, which does not issue a sound when it is struck, <b>and that</b> woman is similar to <b>the place from which she was created,</b> a bone, which makes a sound when it is struck. The proof that a woman’s voice is pleasant is <b>that it is stated</b> in Song of Songs that the man says to his beloved: <b>“For sweet is your voice, and your countenance is beautiful”</b> (Song of Songs 2:14).

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Samaritan <b>girls</b> are considered <b>menstruating women from</b> the time they lie in <b>their cradle. And the Samaritan</b> men <b>impart ritual impurity</b> to the <b>lower bedding like the upper</b> bedding, i.e., all layers of bedding beneath them are impure, and their status is like the bedding above a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>]: The status of both levels of bedding is that of first-degree ritual impurity, which can impart impurity to food and drink. This is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> Samaritan men are considered men who <b>engage in intercourse with menstruating women.</b>
<b>And</b> they are considered men who engage in intercourse with menstruating women because Samaritan women <b>observe</b> the seven-day menstrual period of ritual impurity <b>for each and every</b> emission of <b>blood,</b> even for blood that does not render them impure. Accordingly, if a Samaritan woman has an emission of impure blood during the seven-day period, she will nevertheless continue counting seven days from the first emission. It is therefore possible that the Samaritan men will engage in intercourse with their wives while they are still halakhically considered menstruating women, as the seven-day period of impurity should have been counted from the emission of the impure blood.
<b>But</b> one who enters the Temple while wearing <b>those</b> garments upon which a Samaritan had lain <b>is not liable</b> to bring an offering <b>for entering the Temple</b> in a status of impurity, <b>nor does one burn <i>teruma</i></b> that came into contact with <b>those</b> garments, <b>because their impurity</b> is <b>uncertain.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that Samaritan girls are considered menstruating women from the time they lie in their cradle. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this statement? <b>If</b> the mishna is referring to girls <b>who</b> already <b>see</b> menstrual blood, then <b>even our own,</b> i.e., Jewish girls, are <b>also</b> considered menstruating women under such circumstances. <b>And if</b> it is referring to girls <b>who do not</b> yet <b>see</b> menstrual blood, then <b>their</b> girls, i.e., those of the Samaritans, should <b>also not</b> have the status of menstruating women.
<b>Rava, son of Rav Aḥa bar Rav Huna, says</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet says: Here we are dealing with an unspecified</b> case, i.e., it is unknown whether these girls have experienced their first menstrual period. <b>Since there is a minority</b> of girls <b>who see</b> menstrual blood, <b>we are concerned</b> with regard to each Samaritan girl that she might be from this minority. The Gemara asks: <b>And who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught that one must be concerned for the minority?</b>

Daf 32a

The Gemara responds: <b>It is Rabbi Meir, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A minor boy and a minor girl may not perform the ritual through which a <i>yavam</i> frees a <i>yevama</i> of her levirate bonds [<i>ḥalitza</i>], nor may they enter into levirate marriage.</b> In other words, a minor boy whose brother died childless may not perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with his brother’s widow, nor may he enter into levirate marriage with her, even if she is an adult. Likewise, a minor girl whose husband died childless may not perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with her husband’s brother, nor may she enter into levirate marriage with him, even if he is an adult. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Meir: You have aptly stated that they may not perform <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> since <b>“man” is written in the passage</b> of the Torah discussing <i>ḥalitza</i> (Deuteronomy 25:7), <b>and we compare a woman to a man,</b> as the aforementioned verse states: “And if the man does not want to take his brother’s wife.” Consequently, neither a minor boy nor a minor girl may perform <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>But what is the reason</b> that <b>they may not enter into levirate marriage?</b>
Rabbi Meir <b>said to them: A minor boy</b> may not enter into levirate marriage <b>lest,</b> once he is older, <b>he be found</b> to be <b>a sexually underdeveloped man,</b> who is incapable of fathering children. Likewise, <b>a minor girl</b> may not enter into levirate marriage <b>lest,</b> once she is older, <b>she be found</b> to be <b>a sexually underdeveloped woman. And</b> if a sexually underdeveloped boy or girl enters into levirate marriage <b>they will be found</b> to be <b>infringing upon</b> prohibitions against <b>forbidden sexual intercourse where no mitzva applies,</b> as the entire purpose of levirate marriage is to bear children in the name of the deceased.
The Gemara notes: <b>And the Rabbis</b> maintain that one <b>follows the majority of minor boys, and most minor boys are not</b> going to be <b>sexually underdeveloped men;</b> likewise, one <b>follows the majority of</b> minor girls, <b>and most</b> minor girls <b>are not</b> going to be <b>sexually underdeveloped women.</b> In any event, the <i>baraita</i> indicates that Rabbi Meir is concerned for the minority.
The Gemara objects: You can <b>say that you heard that Rabbi Meir</b> is concerned for <b>a common minority,</b> e.g., the minority of sexually underdeveloped men and sexually underdeveloped women. <b>But did you hear him</b> say that one is concerned for <b>an uncommon minority,</b> such as the minority of young girls who menstruate?
The Gemara explains: <b>This</b> minority of young girls who menstruate <b>is also a common minority. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei said:</b> There was <b>an incident in</b> the town of <b>Ein Bul</b> where <b>they immersed</b> a baby girl in a ritual bath <b>before her mother.</b> In other words, the baby girl experienced bleeding so soon after birth that her immersion in a ritual bath occurred before her mother immersed fourteen days after giving birth. <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi likewise <b>said:</b> There was <b>an incident in Beit She’arim</b> where <b>they immersed</b> a baby girl <b>before her mother. And Rav Yosef said:</b> There was <b>an incident in Pumbedita</b> where <b>they immersed</b> a baby girl <b>before her mother.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> the immersions reported <b>by Rabbi Yosei and by Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi are understandable, <b>due to the <i>teruma</i> of Eretz Yisrael,</b> i.e., these incidents occurred in Eretz Yisrael, where the touch of a menstruating girl disqualifies <i>teruma</i>. <b>But</b> in the incident reported <b>by Rav Yosef,</b> which occurred in Babylonia, <b>why do I</b> need to immerse the baby girl? <b>But doesn’t Shmuel say:</b> The <b><i>teruma</i> of outside of Eretz Yisrael is prohibited only to one whose impurity</b> is due to <b>an emission from his body,</b> e.g., a menstruating woman, or one who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>]. <b>And this statement</b> applies only <b>with regard to eating</b> <i>teruma</i>, <b>but with regard to touching</b> <i>teruma</i>, there is <b>no</b> prohibition. Since the touch of a menstruating woman does not disqualify <i>teruma</i> outside Eretz Yisrael, why was it necessary to immerse the baby girl in the incident reported by Rav Yosef?
<b>Mar Zutra says:</b> That immersion <b>was necessary only for smearing oil of <i>teruma</i></b> of outside of Eretz Yisrael. Since smearing is equivalent to eating, it would have been prohibited to smear such oil on the baby girl, were it not for her immersion in a ritual bath. And from where is it derived that smearing is like eating with regard to <i>teruma</i>? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse discussing the prohibition against consuming <i>teruma</i> in a state of ritual impurity states: <b>“And they shall not desecrate the sacred items of the children of Israel, which they set apart for the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 22:15). The verse serves <b>to include</b> in this prohibition <b>one who smears and one who drinks.</b>
Mar Zutra continues: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> to teach that one who <b>drinks</b> <i>teruma</i> in a state of impurity is liable? Isn’t <b>drinking included</b> in the category of <b>eating? Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means that the verse serves <b>to include one who smears,</b> teaching that he is <b>like one who drinks. And if you wish, say</b> that one may derive that smearing is like drinking <b>from here: “And it came into his innards like water, and like oil into his bones”</b> (Psalms 109:18).
As it stands, the <i>halakha</i> that Samaritan girls are considered menstruating women from the time they lie in their cradle is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, who is concerned for the minority of young girls who menstruate. The Gemara objects: <b>If so,</b> let us be concerned for the same minority with regard to <b>our</b> girls <b>as well.</b>
The Gemara explains: There is no need to be concerned with regard to <b>our</b> young girls, <b>as we interpret</b> the verse: “And if a woman has an issue” (Leviticus 15:19), and derive from the fact that the verse does not merely state: <b>“A woman,”</b> but: <b>“And</b> if <b>a woman,”</b> that even minor girls are included in the <i>halakhot</i> of a menstruating woman. <b>And</b> consequently, <b>when</b> our girls <b>see</b> menstrual blood, <b>we separate them</b> in the manner of all menstruating women. Therefore, <b>the Sages did not decree with regard to them</b> that all young Jewish girls assume the status of menstruating women. By contrast, with regard to <b>them,</b> Samaritans, <b>who do not interpret</b> the difference between <b>“a woman”</b> and <b>“and</b> if <b>a woman,” when</b> their girls <b>see</b> menstrual blood <b>they do not separate them,</b> and therefore <b>the Sages decreed with regard to them</b> that all Samaritan girls assume the status of menstruating women.
§ The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is this interpretation of the difference between <b>“a woman”</b> and <b>“and</b> if <b>a woman”? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that from <b>“a woman” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of menstruation apply to an adult <b>woman. From where</b> do I derive <b>that</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a menstruating woman</b> also apply to <b>a one-day-old girl? The verse states: “And</b> if <b>a woman.”</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Apparently, when the verse includes</b> young girls through the word “and” it <b>includes</b> even <b>a one-day-old. But</b> you can <b>raise a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i>, which discusses the verse: “And the woman with whom a man shall lie carnally, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:18). From the word <b>“woman” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the sexual intercourse of an adult <b>woman</b> is considered intercourse that renders her impure. <b>From where</b> do I derive that the <b>sexual intercourse of a girl aged three years and one day</b> is also classified as intercourse? <b>The verse states: And the woman.</b> Evidently, the word “and” includes only a girl aged three years and one day.
<b>Rava said: These are <i>halakhot</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, <b>and the Sages</b> merely <b>supported them with verses.</b> There is therefore no contradiction. The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> <i>halakha</i> is derived from <b>a verse and which</b> is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai? <b>If we say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that the status of a menstruating woman may apply to <b>a one-day-old</b> girl is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, and the <i>halakha</i> that the intercourse of a girl <b>aged three years and one day</b> is considered intercourse is derived from <b>a verse,</b> then one may object: But <b>the verse is written</b> in <b>an unspecified</b> manner; consequently, a one-day-old girl should be included by the verse in the same manner as a three-year-old girl.
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the intercourse of a girl <b>aged three years and one day</b> is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, whereas the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the menstruation of <b>a one-day-old</b> girl is derived from <b>a verse.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And now that</b> it has been established that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the intercourse of a three-year-old girl is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, <b>why do I</b> need <b>a verse?</b>

Daf 32b

The Gemara responds: The verse serves <b>to exclude a man from</b> contracting ritual impurity due to <b>red</b> semen.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> what about <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a woman who experiences a discharge of uterine blood after her menstrual period [<i>zava</i>]: The verse states: “And if a woman has an issue of her blood many days” (Leviticus 15:25). From the word <b>“woman” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <i>ziva</i> applies to an adult <b>woman. From where</b> do I derive <b>that a ten-day-old</b> girl is included in the <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>ziva</i>? The verse states: “And</b> if <b>a woman.” Why do I</b> need the verse? <b>Let one derive</b> that a ten-day-old girl is included in the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>ziva</i> <b>from</b> the fact that a one-day-old girl is included in the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a menstruating woman,</b> as a woman may become a <i>zava</i> only after seven days of menstruation and three subsequent days of experiencing uterine discharge.
The Gemara responds: It was <b>necessary</b> for the verse to teach that the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>ziva</i> apply to a ten-day-old girl. <b>As, if the Merciful One had written</b> only that a one-day-old girl is included <b>in</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a menstruating woman, I would say:</b> The <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a menstruating woman</b> apply to a one-day-old girl <b>because</b> of their stringency, <b>as when</b> a woman <b>sees blood</b> on only <b>one day she is required to sit</b> for the <b>seven</b> days of menstruation. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a <i>zava</i>,</b> since the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that if</b> a woman <b>sees</b> blood on only <b>one day</b> she has the status of a lesser <i>zava</i>, and it is <b>enough for her</b> to <b>observe</b> a clean <b>day for a day</b> she experiences a discharge, one might <b>say</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>ziva</i> do <b>not</b> apply to a ten-day-old girl. It was therefore <b>necessary</b> for the verse to indicate otherwise.
The Gemara objects: <b>And let the Merciful One write</b> that a ten-day-old girl is included <b>in</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a <i>zava</i>, and</b> it would <b>not</b> be <b>required</b> to write that a one-day-old girl is included <b>in</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of a <b>menstruating woman, and I would know that</b> as a girl <b>cannot</b> become <b>a <i>zava</i> without</b> first assuming the status of <b>a menstruating woman,</b> she must also be included in the <i>halakhot</i> of a menstruating woman. The Gemara responds: <b>Yes, it is indeed so;</b> the fact that a one-day-old girl is included in the <i>halakhot</i> of a menstruating woman can be derived from the fact that a ten-day-old girl is included in the <i>halakhot</i> of a <i>zava</i>. <b>Rather, why do I</b> need the <b>verse:</b> “And if a woman,” that is stated with regard to a menstruating woman? The verse serves <b>to exclude a man from</b> contracting ritual impurity due to <b>red</b> semen.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> the Torah already <b>excluded this</b> case on <b>another occasion,</b> as stated earlier. The Gemara explains: <b>One</b> verse serves <b>to exclude</b> a man <b>from</b> contracting ritual impurity due to red <b>semen, and one</b> verse <b>serves to exclude</b> a man <b>from</b> being rendered a <i>zav</i> due to <b>blood</b> that emanates from his penis.
§ The Gemara discusses the <i>halakha</i> of <i>ziva</i> with regard to a male: <b>And so with regard to males,</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of a <i>zav</i> apply even to minor boys. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states concerning a <i>zav</i>: “When <b>any man</b> has an issue out of his flesh, his issue is impure” (Leviticus 15:2). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “any man”?</b> The verse serves <b>to include a one-day-old baby,</b> teaching <b>that</b> even <b>he is susceptible to impurity of <i>ziva</i>.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says:</b> This derivation <b>is not necessary, as</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “And of them that have an issue, <b>whether it be a male or a female”</b> (Leviticus 15:33). <b>“Whether it be a male”</b> includes <b>anyone who is a male, whether he is an adult</b> or <b>whether he is a minor; “or a female”</b> includes <b>anyone who is a female, whether</b> she is <b>an adult</b> or <b>whether</b> she is <b>a minor. If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “any man”? The Torah spoke in the language of people,</b> and one is not meant to derive anything from this verse.
The Gemara asks: <b>Apparently, when the verse includes</b> a minor boy it <b>includes</b> even <b>a one-day-old. But raise a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i>, which addresses the verse: “And if the flow of seed go out from a man, then he shall bathe all his flesh in water and be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:16). From the word <b>“man” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a man</b> is rendered ritually impure through a seminal emission. <b>From where</b> do I derive that the seminal emission of a boy <b>aged nine years and one day</b> renders him impure as well? <b>The verse states: “And a man.”</b> Evidently, the verse does not include a one-day-old boy.
<b>Rava said: These are <i>halakhot</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, <b>and the Sages</b> merely <b>supported them with verses.</b> Therefore, there is no contradiction. The Gemara asks: <b>Which is a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, <b>and which</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> derived from <b>a verse? If we say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a one-day-old</b> boy is included in the <i>halakhot</i> of a <i>zav</i> is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the seminal emission of a boy <b>aged nine years and one day</b> renders him impure is derived from <b>a verse,</b> then one may object: But <b>the verse is written</b> in <b>an unspecified</b> manner; consequently, even a one-day-old boy should be included in the verse.
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the seminal emission of a boy <b>aged nine years and one day</b> is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a one-day-old</b> boy is included in the <i>halakhot</i> of a <i>zav</i> is derived from <b>a verse.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And now that</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the seminal emission of a boy aged nine years and one day renders <b>is a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, <b>why do I</b> need <b>a verse?</b> The Gemara answers: The verse serves <b>to exclude a woman from</b> contracting the impurity of a <i>zava</i> due to <b>a white</b> discharge.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need for the Merciful One <b>to write</b> that a one-day-old is included in the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>ziva</i> <b>with regard to males, and why do I</b> need for the Merciful One <b>to write</b> that a one-day-old is included in the <i>halakhot</i> of a menstruating woman and a ten-day-old is included in the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>ziva</i> <b>with regard to females?</b>
The Gemara answers that both verses <b>are necessary. As, if the Merciful One had written</b> only <b>concerning males,</b> one might say: A one-day-old boy is included in the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>ziva</i> <b>because</b> the <i>halakha</i> is more stringent with regard to males, <b>as they are rendered impure through</b> three <b>sightings</b> of <i>ziva</i> on one day just <b>like through</b> sightings on three consecutive <b>days. But</b> with regard to <b>females, who are not rendered impure through</b> three <b>sightings</b> on one day <b>as</b> they are <b>through</b> sightings on three consecutive <b>days,</b> one might <b>say</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>ziva</i> do <b>not</b> apply to ten-day-old girls.
<b>And</b> by contrast, <b>if the Merciful One had written</b> only <b>with regard to females,</b> one might say: The <i>halakhot</i> of <i>ziva</i> apply to ten-day-old girls, <b>because</b> of the fact that <b>they are rendered impure</b> even on account of sightings that occur <b>due to circumstances beyond</b> their <b>control. But</b> with regard to <b>males, who are not rendered impure</b> on account of sightings that occur <b>due to circumstances beyond</b> their <b>control,</b> one might <b>say</b> that one-day-old boys are <b>not</b> included in the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>ziva</i>. Therefore, both verses are <b>necessary.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And the Samaritan</b> men <b>impart ritual impurity</b> to the <b>lower bedding like</b> the <b>upper</b> bedding. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the clause: The <b>lower bedding like</b> the <b>upper</b> bedding? <b>If we say</b> it means <b>that if there are ten mattresses</b> stacked one upon the other <b>and</b> a Samaritan man <b>sat upon them,</b> the lowest mattress, like the upper mattresses, is <b>rendered impure,</b> this <i>halakha</i> is <b>obvious, since he presses</b> on all of <b>them</b> when he sits on them. In other words, since Samaritan men impart impurity to the bedding beneath them because they are considered men who engage in intercourse with menstruating women, there is no reason to distinguish between the lowest mattress and the other mattresses above it.
<b>Rather,</b> the mishna means <b>that</b> the status of the lowest mattress <b>beneath</b> a man who <b>engages in intercourse with a menstruating woman is like</b> that of the bedding <b>above a <i>zav</i>,</b> i.e., the bedding beneath a Samaritan man assumes first-degree ritual impurity and does not become a primary source of impurity like the bedding beneath a <i>zav</i>. That is, <b>just as</b> the <b>upper</b> bedding <b>of a <i>zav</i></b> is not a primary source of impurity and <b>imparts impurity only</b> to <b>food and drink</b> but not people or vessels, <b>so too,</b> the bedding <b>beneath</b> a man who <b>engages in intercourse with a menstruating woman imparts ritual impurity only</b> to <b>food and drink.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that the bedding <b>above a <i>zav</i></b> imparts ritual impurity only to food and drink? <b>As it is written</b> with regard to a <i>zav</i>: <b>“And whoever touches any thing that was under him shall be impure”</b> (Leviticus 15:10). <b>What</b> is the meaning of the expression <b>“under him”?</b>

Daf 33a

<b>If we say</b> the verse is teaching that a mattress <b>beneath a <i>zav</i></b> is impure, this is already <b>derived from</b> the verse: <b>“And whoever touches his bed”</b> (Leviticus 15:5). <b>Rather,</b> the verse is referring to that <b>which touches any</b> item <b>under which the <i>zav</i> will be. And what is this</b> item? It is the bedding <b>above a <i>zav</i>.</b> The verse teaches that the bedding above a <i>zav</i> imparts ritual impurity.
The verse further states: “And he who bears [<i>vehanoseh</i>] these things shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:10), indicating that <b>he who bears also becomes impure. And what is this?</b> This is an item <b>borne [<i>nisa</i>]</b> by a <i>zav</i>. <b>What is the reason,</b> i.e., how is this indicated by the verse? The term <b><i>vehanisa</i> is written</b> in the verse.
The Gemara continues: <b>The verse removed</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the bedding above a <i>zav</i> <b>from</b> the status of <b>severe impurity and brought it to</b> the status of <b>lesser impurity, to tell you that it imparts impurity only</b> to <b>food and drink,</b> but not to people or garments.
The Gemara objects: <b>Say</b> that <b>the verse removed</b> the bedding above a <i>zav</i> <b>from severe impurity,</b> in the sense <b>that it does not impart impurity</b> to <b>a person to</b> the extent that he may in turn <b>impart impurity</b> to the <b>garments</b> he is wearing. <b>But let</b> the bedding above a <i>zav</i> <b>impart impurity</b> to <b>people or garments.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>the verse states:</b> “And whoever touches anything that was under him <b>shall be impure”</b> (Leviticus 15:10), which <b>indicates lesser impurity.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that Samaritan men are considered men who engage in intercourse with menstruating women, and consequently they impart impurity to the bedding beneath them. The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that the bedding <b>beneath</b> one who <b>engages in intercourse with a menstruating woman</b> is impure? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a menstruating woman: “And if any man lie with her, <b>and her impurity be upon him,</b> he shall be impure seven days, and every bed upon which he lies shall be impure” (Leviticus 15:24).
The <i>baraita</i> explains: One <b>might</b> have thought that the phrase: “And her impurity be upon him,” indicates that the man assumes the impure status of the menstruating woman with whom he engaged in intercourse, such that if they were together on the sixth day of her menstruation <b>he may elevate</b> himself <b>at her time,</b> i.e., he may immerse in a ritual bath the next day, just like the menstruating woman. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “He shall be impure seven days.”</b>
<b>But</b> if so, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “And her impurity be upon him”? As,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that a man who engages in intercourse with a menstruating woman <b>will not impart impurity</b> to <b>people and earthenware vessels.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And her impurity be upon him,”</b> to teach that he imparts impurity like a menstruating woman. In other words, <b>just as she imparts impurity</b> to <b>people and earthenware vessels, so too, he imparts impurity</b> to <b>people and earthenware vessels.</b>
<b>If</b> so, i.e., that one who engages in intercourse with a menstruating woman is compared to the woman herself, then say: <b>Just as she renders</b> the <b>bedding</b> beneath her <b>and</b> the <b>seat</b> upon which she sits impure <b>to</b> the extent that they <b>impart impurity</b> to <b>a person to</b> in turn <b>impart impurity</b> to <b>the garments</b> he is wearing, <b>so too, he renders</b> the <b>bedding</b> beneath him <b>and</b> the <b>seat</b> upon which he sits impure <b>to</b> the extent that they <b>impart impurity</b> to <b>a person to</b> in turn <b>impart impurity</b> to <b>the garments</b> he is wearing. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And every bed upon which he lies shall be impure”</b> (Leviticus 15:24).
The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: <b>As,</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “And every bed upon which he lies shall be impure,”</b> since it is already written: “And her impurity be upon him,” which indicates that just as a menstruating woman imparts impurity to her bedding, so too does one who has intercourse with her. <b>And</b> if so, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “And every bed upon</b> which he lies shall be impure”? <b>The verse separated</b> the <i>halakha</i> of one who has intercourse with a menstruating woman <b>from</b> the <b>severe impurity</b> of the menstruating woman herself, <b>and brought him to lesser impurity, to tell you that he imparts impurity only</b> to <b>food and drink,</b> but not to people or garments.
<b>Rav Aḥai refutes</b> this derivation: <b>Say</b> that <b>the verse removed</b> the <i>halakha</i> of one who has intercourse with a menstruating woman <b>from severe impurity and brought it to lesser impurity,</b> in the sense <b>that</b> his bedding <b>does not impart impurity</b> to <b>a person to</b> in turn <b>impart impurity</b> to the <b>garments</b> upon him. <b>But let</b> his bedding <b>impart impurity</b> to <b>people or garments. Rav Asi says:</b> The verse states: “And every bed upon which he lies <b>shall be impure,”</b> which <b>indicates a lesser impurity.</b>
The Gemara objects: But <b>say</b> that the phrase: <b>“And her impurity be upon him,”</b> is <b>a generalization,</b> and the phrase: <b>“And every bed</b> upon which he lies shall be impure,” is <b>a detail.</b> If so, the verse constitutes <b>a generalization and a detail,</b> and it is a hermeneutical principle that in such a case <b>the generalization</b> is referring <b>only</b> to <b>that which</b> is specified <b>in the detail.</b> Accordingly, with regard to the <b>bedding and seat</b> upon which the man rests, <b>yes,</b> they are rendered impure, but <b>other items</b> are <b>not.</b>
<b>Abaye says</b> that when the verse states: <b>“He shall be impure seven days,”</b> between the generalization and the detail, this <b>interrupts the matter.</b> Accordingly, <b>this is</b> a case of <b>a generalization and a detail that are distant from one another, and</b> with regard to <b>any generalization and detail that are distant from one another, one does not derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> from them in accordance with the principle <b>of a generalization and a detail.</b>
<b>Rava says: Actually, one may derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> from a generalization and a detail that are distant from one another. But this verse does not constitute a case of a generalization and a detail, as the verse states: “And every bed upon which he lies.” The term <b>“and every” is an amplification.</b>
<b>Rabbi Ya’akov objects to this: Say</b> that as the verse compares a man who engages in intercourse with a menstruating woman to the woman herself, the man should be <b>like her,</b> i.e., <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>her you did not differentiate between her touch and her bedding in terms of imparting impurity</b> to <b>a person and imparting impurity to garments,</b> as the <i>halakha</i> is <b>stringent</b> concerning both in that her touch and her bedding impart impurity to people to in turn impart impurity to their garments; <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>him, you shall not differentiate between his touch and his bedding in terms of imparting impurity</b> to <b>a person and imparting impurity to garments,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> should be <b>lenient</b> in both cases: Neither his bedding nor his touch should impart impurity to people to in turn impart impurity to their garments.
<b>Rava says</b> in response that when the verse states: “And her impurity be <b>upon him,”</b> this <b>indicates</b> that the Torah intends for the impurity <b>to weigh upon him,</b> i.e., in a stringent manner.
§ The mishna teaches that the impurity of Samaritan men is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> Samaritan men are considered men who <b>engage in intercourse with menstruating women,</b> and this is because they observe the seven-day menstrual period of impurity for each and every emission of blood. The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say</b> that <b>all</b> Samaritan men <b>are</b> considered men who <b>engage in intercourse with menstruating women?</b> Aren’t there some unmarried men who do not engage in intercourse with menstruating women? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak of Migdal says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> only <b>with regard to</b> men to whom women are <b>married.</b>
The mishna further teaches: <b>And</b> Samaritan men are considered men who engage in intercourse with menstruating women because <b>they observe</b> the seven-day menstrual period of impurity <b>for</b> each and every emission of <b>blood.</b> In this regard <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir said: If</b> Samaritan women would begin <b>observing</b> a seven-day period of impurity <b>for each and every</b> emission of <b>blood, it</b> would be <b>a great remedy for them,</b> i.e., this practice would not lead to sin, as they would observe a seven-day period from each emission. But this is not their practice.
<b>Rather,</b> when Samaritan women see green blood, which does not render them impure, they begin counting seven days of impurity from that emission. <b>As,</b> if <b>they see red blood,</b> which is impure, during that period, they do not begin observing another seven days. Instead, they consider it an additional emission of blood <b>and they complete</b> the remaining days from the seven days they began observing <b>for</b> the <b>green blood.</b> Consequently, the women will have immersed in a ritual bath while still impure.
<b>Alternatively,</b> a Samaritan woman is considered ritually impure because she <b>counts</b> the <b>day</b> on <b>which she ceases</b> to experience three consecutive days of emissions of <i>ziva</i> <b>toward</b> the <b>total</b> of <b>seven</b> clean days that a <i>zava</i> must experience before being able to immerse in a ritual bath. Accordingly, she does not wait seven full days, as is required by <i>halakha</i>.
<b>Rami bar Ḥama objects to this: And let her count that</b> day on which she ceases to experience emissions of <i>ziva</i>, <b>and we,</b> i.e., Jewish women, <b>shall also count it, as we maintain</b> that the halakhic status of <b>part of the day is like</b> that <b>of an entire</b> day.
<b>Rava says</b> in response: <b>If so,</b> that even with regard to <i>ziva</i> the halakhic status of part of the day is like that of an entire day, one can object: It is taught in a <i>baraita</i> that if a <i>zav</i> experiences an emission of <b>semen</b> while counting seven clean days toward his purity, the seminal emission <b>negates</b> the day on which he experiences it. <b>How can you find the</b> circumstances of this <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to <i>ziva</i>? Isn’t</b> the halakhic status of <b>part of the day is like</b> that <b>of an entire</b> day? If so, let the remainder of the day on which he experiences the emission count as a day.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: Perhaps even with regard to <i>ziva</i> the halakhic status of part of the day is like that of an entire day, and <b>if</b> the <i>zav</i> <b>sees</b> the seminal emission <b>in the middle of the day,</b> the remainder of the day is <b>indeed</b> counted as a whole day. But <b>here we are dealing with</b> a <i>zav</i> <b>who sees</b> a seminal emission <b>adjacent to sunset,</b> when there is no remaining time in the day that can be counted as an entire day.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a seminal emission negates a day from the count of a <i>zav</i> is derived from the verse: “This is the law of the <i>zav</i>, and of him from whom the flow of seed goes out, so that he is impure thereby” (Leviticus 15:32). Is it right that one <b>will stand and say about the verse</b> that <b>when it is written, it is written</b> specifically with regard to a seminal emission that occurs <b>adjacent to sunset?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Yes, perforce you must leave</b> aside the plain meaning <b>of</b> this <b>verse, as it compels itself to be established</b> as referring to such limited circumstances because it must conform to the principle that the halakhic status of part of the day is like that of an entire day.
§ The Gemara mentioned earlier that if a <i>zav</i> experiences a seminal emission while counting seven clean days toward his purity, the seminal emission negates the day on which he experiences it. On a similar note, <b>Rami bar Ḥama raises a dilemma:</b> In the case of a woman who <b>discharges semen</b> after engaging in intercourse with her husband, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>as to</b> whether <b>she negates</b> her counting <b>with regard to <i>ziva</i>?</b> Rami bar Ḥama elaborates: In general, a woman who discharges semen is impure, but the reason for this <i>halakha</i> is uncertain. Is it because <b>she was</b> considered one who <b>saw</b> semen, i.e., the emission of semen itself renders her impure just like a man who experiences a seminal emission? <b>And</b> if so, this woman <b>negates</b> her count.

Daf 33b

<b>Or perhaps</b> it is because <b>she was touching</b> the semen, <b>and</b> if so <b>she has not</b> thereby <b>negated</b> her count, just as a <i>zav</i> does not negate his count if he touches semen.
<b>Rava says: Commensurate with the sharpness</b> of Rami bar Ḥama is the extent of his <b>error,</b> as this is not a dilemma at all, since <b>even</b> if one could suggest <b>that</b> a <i>zava</i> who discharges semen has <b>indeed negated</b> her count, one must ask: <b>How much should she negate?</b> If one suggests <b>she should negate</b> all <b>seven</b> days of her counting, this is untenable, as <b>it is enough for her</b> that she should negate her count <b>like</b> the man who <b>engages in intercourse with her,</b> i.e., like a <i>zav</i> who discharges semen, who negates only one day.
And if one suggests that <b>she should negate one day</b> alone, this too is untenable, as <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “But if she is purified from her <i>ziva</i> then she shall count to herself seven days, <b>and after that she shall be pure”</b> (Leviticus 15:28). The word <b>“after”</b> indicates that she shall be pure only <b>after all of them,</b> i.e., after seven consecutive clean days, such <b>that there should be no impurity separating between them.</b> If so, there cannot be a situation where a <i>zava</i> negates a single day, and consequently it cannot be that a <i>zava</i> who discharges semen negates any part of her count.
The Gemara rejects Rava’s response: <b>And according to your reasoning, how does a <i>zav</i> himself negate</b> only one day from his count due to a seminal emission? After all, <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And when the <i>zav</i> is purified of his <i>ziva</i>, then he shall count for himself seven days for his purification, and wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and he shall be pure” (Leviticus 15:13). The phrase: “Seven days <b>for his purification,”</b> indicates <b>that there should be no impurity separating between them.</b>
<b>Rather, what have you to say?</b> The verse means only <b>that there should not be an impurity of <i>ziva</i> separating between them. Here too,</b> with regard to a <i>zava</i>, the verse means only <b>that there should not be an impurity of <i>ziva</i> separating between them;</b> a discharge of semen is not included in this restriction. It is therefore possible that a discharge of semen from a <i>zava</i> negates only one day from her count. Accordingly, the dilemma raised by Rami bar Ḥama remains in place.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>But</b> one who enters the Temple while wearing <b>those</b> garments upon which a Samaritan had lain <b>is not liable</b> to bring an offering <b>for entering the Temple,</b> nor does one burn <i>teruma</i> that came into contact with those garments, because their impurity is uncertain. In connection to these <i>halakhot</i>, the Gemara relates that <b>Rav Pappa happened</b> to come <b>to</b> the city of <b>Tavakh. He said: If there is a Torah scholar here I will go and greet him. A certain elderly woman said to him: There is a Torah scholar here and Rav Shmuel is his name, and he teaches <i>mishnayot</i>; may it be</b> God’s <b>will that you should be like him.</b>
Rav Pappa <b>said</b> to himself: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that they bless me through</b> this Rav Shmuel that I should be like him, I may <b>conclude from it</b> that <b>he is a God-fearing</b> individual. Rav Pappa <b>went to</b> visit <b>him,</b> and Rav Shmuel <b>raised a bull for him,</b> i.e., he slaughtered a bull in honor of Rav Pappa, and he also <b>raised</b> a difficulty between two <b><i>mishnayot</i></b> that apparently contradict <b>one another: We learn</b> in the mishna: One who enters the Temple while wearing <b>those</b> garments upon which a Samaritan had lain is <b>not liable</b> to bring an offering <b>for entering the Temple, nor does one burn <i>teruma</i></b> that came into contact with <b>those</b> garments, <b>because their impurity is uncertain. Evidently, we do not burn <i>teruma</i> due to uncertain</b> impurity.
<b>And</b> one can <b>raise a contradiction</b> from another mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 4:5): <b>For six</b> cases of <b>uncertain</b> impurity <b>one burns the <i>teruma</i></b> if it came into contact with them, or if a person came into contact with them and subsequently touched the <i>teruma</i>. One of these is <b>for the uncertain</b> case <b>of the garments of one who is unreliable with regard to ritual impurity [<i>am ha’aretz</i>].</b> Such garments impart impurity through contact and through carrying, due to a concern that the wife of the <i>am ha’aretz</i> might have sat on them while she was menstruating. Evidently, one burns <i>teruma</i> due to uncertain impurity.
<b>Rav Pappa</b> began his response with a supplication and <b>said: May it be</b> God’s <b>will that this bull shall be eaten peacefully,</b> i.e., that I will provide a satisfactory resolution of this contradiction. Since the bull was slaughtered in my honor, failing to resolve the contradiction might spoil the meal. Rav Pappa continued: <b>Here we are dealing with a Samaritan</b> who is <b>devoted to the meticulous observance of mitzvot, especially <i>halakhot</i> of ritual purity, <i>teruma</i>, and tithes [<i>ḥaver</i>].</b> There is therefore less concern with regard to his ritual purity than that of an <i>am ha’aretz</i>. Consequently, the mishna here states that <i>teruma</i> is not burned on account of him.
Rav Shmuel rejected this response: Since the mishna is referring to men who engage in intercourse with menstruating women, <b>are you equating a Samaritan <i>ḥaver</i></b> with a man who <b>engages in intercourse with a menstruating woman?</b>
Rav Pappa <b>left</b> Rav Shmuel in embarrassment <b>and came before Rav Shimi bar Ashi,</b> to whom he related this incident. Rav Shimi bar Ashi <b>said to him: What is the reason</b> that <b>you did not respond to him</b> that the ruling of the mishna is stated <b>with regard to a Samaritan who immersed</b> in a ritual bath <b>and arose</b> from his impure status, <b>and</b> subsequently <b>trod on the garments of a <i>ḥaver</i>,</b> which means they are now considered the bedding of the Samaritan, <b>and</b> then those <b>garments of</b> the <b><i>ḥaver</i> went and touched <i>teruma</i>?</b> In such a case one does not burn the <i>teruma</i>.
<b>As, if</b> one would say to burn it <b>due to the impurity of an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, he</b> has <b>immersed</b> in a ritual bath. <b>And if</b> one were to suggest that it should be burned <b>because</b> the Samaritan is one who <b>engages in intercourse with a menstruating woman,</b> this too is an unsatisfactory reason. This is because it is <b>uncertain</b> whether <b>he recently engaged in intercourse</b> with his wife, in which case his immersion does not remove his impurity; and it is <b>uncertain</b> whether <b>he did not recently engage in intercourse</b> with his wife, in which case he is in fact pure.
<b>And</b> even <b>if you say</b> that <b>he recently engaged in intercourse</b> with his wife, another uncertainty remains: It is <b>uncertain</b> whether his wife began counting seven days from an emission of green blood and ignored any subsequent emission of red blood and <b>completed</b> her count for the <b>green</b> blood, which would mean that she was in fact a menstruating woman when she engaged in sexual intercourse with her husband; and it is <b>uncertain</b> whether <b>she did not complete</b> a count of seven days from the emission of the green blood, rather from the emission of red blood, in which case she was not a menstruating woman when her husband engaged in intercourse with her. <b>And</b> therefore <b>this is a compound uncertainty, and</b> there is a principle that <b>one does not burn <i>teruma</i> on</b> account of <b>a compound uncertainty.</b>
Rav Pappa raised an objection to Rav Shimi bar Ashi: <b>And let</b> one <b>derive</b> that the garments of the <i>ḥaver</i> are impure <b>because</b> they came into contact with the <b>garments of an <i>am ha’aretz</i>. As the Master said:</b> The <b>garments of an <i>am ha’aretz</i></b> are considered impure with the ritual impurity imparted by the <b>treading</b> of a <i>zav</i>, which means they impart impurity to people and to garments, <b>for individuals who are scrupulous with regard to impurity [<i>perushin</i>].</b> Rav Shimi bar Ashi <b>said to</b> Rav Pappa: The mishna is referring <b>to a naked Samaritan.</b> Consequently, none of his garments came into contact with the garments of the <i>ḥaver</i>.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>Sadducee girls, when they were accustomed to follow in the ways of their</b> Sadducee <b>ancestors their</b> status <b>is like</b> that of <b>Samaritan women,</b> whose <i>halakha</i> was discussed in the previous mishna. If the Sadducee women <b>abandoned</b> the customs of their ancestors in order <b>to follow in the ways of the Jewish people</b> their status <b>is like</b> that of <b>a Jewish woman. Rabbi Yosei says: Their</b> status <b>is always like</b> that of <b>a Jewish woman, until they will abandon</b> the ways of the Jewish people in order <b>to follow in the ways of their</b> Sadducee <b>ancestors.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in <b>an unspecified</b> case, i.e., when the custom of a Sadducee woman is unknown? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> evidence from the mishna: With regard to <b>Sadducee girls, when they are accustomed to follow in the ways of their</b> Sadducee <b>ancestors their</b> status <b>is like</b> that of <b>Samaritan women.</b> It can be inferred from the mishna <b>that</b> in <b>an unspecified</b> case their status <b>is like</b> that of <b>a Jewish woman.</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Say the latter clause:</b> If the Sadducee women <b>abandoned</b> the customs of their ancestors in order <b>to follow in the ways of the Jewish people their</b> status <b>is like</b> that of <b>a Jewish woman.</b> One may infer from this <b>that</b> in <b>an unspecified</b> case their status <b>is like</b> that of <b>Samaritan women. Rather, no</b> inference is <b>to be learned from this</b> mishna.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the last clause of the mishna, <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Their</b> status <b>is always like</b> that of <b>a Jewish woman, until they will abandon</b> the ways of the Jewish people in order <b>to follow in the ways of their</b> Sadducee <b>ancestors. By inference,</b> one may conclude <b>that the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that in <b>an unspecified</b> case their status <b>is like</b> that of <b>Samaritan women.</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from it</b> that this is the case.
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> There was <b>an incident involving a certain Sadducee who was conversing with the High Priest in the marketplace, and</b> as he was speaking, <b>saliva [<i>tzinora</i>] sprayed from his mouth and fell onto the garments of the High Priest. And the face of the High Priest turned green,</b> as he feared that his garments had been rendered ritually impure. <b>And he rushed to</b> the Sadducee’s <b>wife</b> to inquire whether she properly observed the <i>halakhot</i> of menstruation, in which case his garments were not rendered impure by the saliva of her husband, as he is not considered one who engages in intercourse with a menstruating woman.
<b>She said to him: Even though</b> women such as myself <b>are the wives of Sadducees,</b> who do not follow in the ways of the <i>perushim</i>, <b>they are scared of the <i>perushim</i> and they show</b> their <b>blood to the Sages</b> when an uncertainty arises. The garments of the High Priest are therefore pure, as the Sadducee wives properly observe the <i>halakhot</i> of menstruation.
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: We are familiar with the</b> wives of Sadducees <b>more so than everyone</b> else, as they are our neighbors, <b>and</b> I can testify that <b>they</b> all <b>show</b> their <b>blood to the Sages, except for a certain woman who was</b> living <b>in our neighborhood who did not show</b> her <b>blood to the Sages, and she died,</b> as a punishment for her behavior.
The Gemara objects: <b>And let</b> the High Priest <b>derive</b> that his garments are impure <b>due to the saliva of an <i>am ha’aretz</i>,</b> which imparts impurity. <b>Abaye said:</b> That case involved <b>a Sadducee <i>ḥaver</i>,</b> who was particular with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual purity. <b>Rava said: Are you equating a Sadducee <i>ḥaver</i></b> with a man who <b>engages in intercourse with a menstruating woman?</b> After all, the High Priest was initially concerned that the Sadducee might engage in intercourse with his wife while she is still menstruating. <b>Rather, Rava said:</b>

Daf 34a

This incident occurred during <b>a pilgrimage Festival,</b> either Passover, <i>Sukkot</i>, or <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>and the Sages rendered the ritual impurity of an <i>am ha’aretz</i> during a pilgrimage Festival as purity. As it is written: “And all the men of Israel gathered to the city, like one man, united [<i>ḥaverim</i>]”</b> (Judges 20:11). Whenever all the Jewish people gather in a single place, such as on a pilgrimage Festival, <b>the verse renders all of them <i>ḥaverim</i>,</b> even one who is an <i>am ha’aretz</i>. There was therefore no concern for impurity due to the saliva of an <i>am ha’aretz</i>. Yet, the High Priest was concerned that this Sadducee was one who engages in intercourse with a menstruating woman.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to the <b>blood of</b> a menstruating <b>gentile woman</b> or a gentile <i>zava</i>, <b>and</b> the <b>blood</b> discharged <b>by</b> a female Jewish <b>leper</b> during the days <b>of purity</b> of a woman who gives birth, <b>Beit Shammai deem</b> them <b>ritually pure, and Beit Hillel say:</b> The halakhic status of the blood of the gentile woman is <b>like</b> that of <b>her saliva and her urine,</b> which impart impurity only while moist. Likewise, the blood discharged by a Jewish leper during the days of purity imparts impurity only when moist.
With regard to <b>the blood of a woman who gave birth</b> and reached the conclusion of her days of impurity, i.e., seven days after giving birth to a male or fourteen days after giving birth to a female, but <b>who did not</b> yet <b>immerse</b> in a ritual bath, <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> Although she has yet to immerse in a ritual bath, the blood does not retain the halakhic status of menstrual blood. Rather, the status of the blood is <b>like</b> that of <b>her saliva and her urine,</b> and it imparts impurity only while moist. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> Since she did not immerse in a ritual bath, her blood is considered like that of a menstruating woman, and it <b>imparts impurity</b> whether it is <b>moist or dry.</b>
<b>And</b> Beit Shammai <b>concede</b> to Beit Hillel <b>in</b> the case of <b>a woman who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>,</b> where the woman must count seven clean days from the conclusion of her days of impurity, <b>that</b> any blood <b>she</b> sees during those seven days <b>imparts impurity</b> whether it is <b>moist or dry.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that according to Beit Shammai the blood of a gentile woman does not impart impurity. The Gemara objects: <b>And do Beit Shammai not accept</b> that which is taught with regard to the verse: <b>“Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, when any man has an issue [<i>zav</i>]</b> out of his flesh, his issue is impure” (Leviticus 15:2), from which it is inferred: By Torah law, <b>the children of Israel become impure through <i>ziva</i> and gentiles do not become impure through <i>ziva</i>, but</b> the Sages <b>decreed concerning them that they shall be like <i>zavin</i> in all their matters</b> of ritual purity.
The Gemara responds: <b>Beit Shammai</b> could <b>say to you</b> that <b>this was stated</b> only <b>with regard to males,</b> not females. <b>As, if</b> it was stated even <b>with regard to females, how should one act</b> with regard to this impurity? <b>Should</b> their blood <b>impart impurity</b> whether it is <b>moist or dry?</b> If so, <b>you have rendered it like</b> blood that imparts impurity <b>by Torah</b> law, and people will mistakenly come to burn <i>teruma</i> that comes into contact with it. Perhaps one will suggest that it <b>should impart impurity</b> only while it is <b>moist and it should not impart impurity</b> when it is <b>dry.</b> But if so, <b>you</b> will have <b>differentiated</b> between moist and dry blood even <b>with regard to</b> blood <b>that</b> is impure by <b>Torah</b> law, i.e., one might mistakenly conclude that the blood of Jewish women imparts impurity only when it is moist, when in fact it imparts impurity whether it is moist or dry.
The Gemara objects: <b>If so,</b> then with regard to <b>the saliva and urine of</b> a gentile <i>zava</i>, which impart impurity by rabbinic law only when moist, Beit Shammai should <b>also</b> rule that they do not impart impurity at all, in order to distinguish their saliva and urine from that of a Jewish <i>zava</i>, which by Torah law impart impurity only when moist (see 54b). The Gemara responds: <b>Since we implement a conspicuous marker with regard to the blood of</b> a gentile woman, i.e., it is clear that her status is different from that of a Jewish woman in that her blood does not impart impurity whatsoever, everyone <b>will know that</b> the impurity of <b>her saliva and her urine</b> is only <b>by rabbinic</b> law, and there is no concern that people might come to mistakenly burn <i>teruma</i> that comes into contact with the saliva and urine of a gentile <i>zava</i>.
The Gemara persists: <b>And let them implement a conspicuous marker with regard to the saliva and urine of</b> a gentile woman, that they should not impart impurity whatsoever, <b>and let them deem her blood impure</b> even when dry. In this manner, everyone will know that the impurity of a gentile woman applies only by rabbinic law, and they will not come to treat that which is impure by Torah law in the same manner. The Gemara responds: With regard to <b>her saliva and her urine, which are</b> relatively <b>common, the Sages decreed</b> that <b>they</b> are impure, but with regard to <b>her blood, which is not</b> as <b>common, the Sages did not decree</b> that <b>it</b> is impure.
§ With regard to a gentile man, <b>Rava says: The <i>ziva</i> of</b> a gentile man is <b>ritually impure, even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai,</b> who maintain that the <i>ziva</i> of a gentile woman does not impart impurity whatsoever. By contrast, <b>the semen of</b> a gentile is <b>pure, even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel,</b> who hold that the blood of menstruating gentiles and the blood of their <i>ziva</i> imparts impurity when it is moist.
Rava elaborates: <b>The <i>ziva</i> of</b> a gentile man is <b>impure, even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, as it is</b> possible <b>to implement a conspicuous marker with his semen,</b> i.e., since his semen does not impart impurity whatsoever, everyone will know that the impurity imparted by the <i>ziva</i> of a gentile applies by rabbinic law, and they will not come to burn <i>teruma</i> that comes in contact with the <i>ziva</i> of a gentile.
And <b>the semen of</b> a gentile is <b>ritually pure, even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel.</b> This is because <b>the Sages</b> had to <b>implement a conspicuous marker with regard to it</b> to indicate that the <i>ziva</i> of a gentile imparts impurity only by rabbinic law <b>in order that they will not</b> come <b>to burn <i>teruma</i> and consecrated</b> items <b>that</b> come into contact with their <i>ziva</i>, as must be performed with <i>teruma</i> and consecrated items that contract impurity by Torah law.
The Gemara objects: <b>And let</b> the Sages <b>implement a conspicuous marker with regard to the <i>ziva</i> of</b> a gentile man, that it should not impart impurity whatsoever, <b>and let them deem his semen impure.</b> The Gemara explains: With regard to <b>his <i>ziva</i>, which is not dependent on an action</b> he performs but is emitted on its own, <b>the Sages decreed</b> that <b>it</b> is impure; with regard to <b>his semen, which is dependent on an action</b> he performs, <b>the Sages did not decree</b> that <b>it</b> is impure.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the following mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 8:4) <b>supports</b> Rava’s opinion: In the case of <b>a gentile woman who discharged semen</b> that came <b>from a Jew</b> who engaged in intercourse with her, the semen is <b>impure,</b> as it came from a Jew. <b>And</b> in the case of <b>a Jewish woman who discharged semen</b> that came <b>from a gentile,</b> the semen is <b>pure. What, is it not</b> correct to say that the mishna means the semen of the gentile is <b>entirely pure,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rava? The Gemara refutes this suggestion: <b>No,</b> perhaps the mishna means that the semen of a gentile is <b>pure by Torah law</b> but <b>impure by rabbinic law,</b> whereas according to Rava, the semen of a gentile is pure even by rabbinic law.
The Gemara cites another source that possibly supports Rava’s opinion: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>You are found</b> to <b>say the semen of a Jew is impure wherever</b> it is found,

Daf 34b

<b>even</b> if it is <b>in the womb of a gentile woman.</b> If she discharges this semen, it imparts ritual impurity. <b>And</b> by contrast, the semen <b>of a gentile is ritually pure wherever</b> it is found, <b>even</b> if it is <b>in the womb of a Jewish woman, except for</b> any <b>urine that</b> intermingled <b>with it.</b> In other words, if the semen of a gentile intermingled with his urine, the mixture is impure due to the urine it contains, as the Sages decreed that a gentile is considered like a <i>zav</i> in all matters. Consequently, his urine imparts impurity.
The Gemara continues: <b>And if you would say</b> in rejection of this proof: Here <b>as well,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means that the semen of a gentile is <b>ritually pure by Torah law but impure by rabbinic</b> law, one may respond: Since the <i>baraita</i> states that the urine of a gentile is impure, <b>is that to say</b> that <b>her urine,</b> i.e., the urine of the gentile that intermingled with his semen and is now inside the womb of the Jewish woman, is <b>ritually impure by Torah law?</b> Isn’t it impure only by rabbinic law? <b>Rather, conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that the semen of a gentile is <b>pure even by rabbinic law.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>conclude from it</b> that this is so.
<b>The Master said</b> above in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The semen of a Jew is impure wherever</b> it is found, <b>even</b> if it is <b>in the womb of a gentile woman.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let one resolve</b> from this <i>baraita</i> a dilemma <b>that Rav Pappa raises. As Rav Pappa raises a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>semen of a Jew in the womb of a gentile woman?</b> Let one conclude from the <i>baraita</i> that the semen is impure.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: Rav Pappa <b>does not raise his dilemma</b> with regard to the semen of a Jew that is in the womb of a gentile woman <b>within three</b> days of their intercourse, as such semen is impure. Rather, <b>when</b> Rav Pappa <b>raises his dilemma</b> it is with regard to semen in the womb of the gentile more than <b>three</b> days <b>after</b> their intercourse. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in such a case?
The Gemara explains the sides of the dilemma: Do we say that as <b>Jewish</b> women <b>are concerned about</b> the proper fulfillment of <b>mitzvot, their bodies are hot and</b> semen in their wombs <b>becomes foul</b> within three days, whereas <b>gentile</b> women <b>are not concerned about</b> the proper fulfillment of <b>mitzvot</b> and therefore <b>their bodies are not hot and</b> semen in their wombs <b>does not become foul</b> within three days? <b>Or perhaps, since</b> gentiles <b>eat repugnant creatures and creeping animals, their bodies are</b> also <b>hot and</b> semen in their wombs <b>becomes foul</b> within three days? Since no resolution is found, the Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>blood</b> discharged <b>by</b> a female Jewish <b>leper</b> during the days <b>of purity</b> of a woman who gives birth, <b>Beit Shammai</b> deem it ritually pure and Beit Hillel say it imparts impurity only while moist. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Beit Hillel,</b> i.e., from where is their opinion derived? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> The verse states at the conclusion of the passage discussing impure individuals: “Whether it be a male or a female” (Leviticus 15:33). <b>“Whether it be a male”</b> serves <b>to include the sources</b> of bodily emissions <b>of a male leper,</b> teaching that they also impart impurity. Likewise, the phrase <b>“or a female”</b> serves <b>to include the sources</b> of bodily emissions <b>of a female leper,</b> teaching that they too impart impurity.
<b>What</b> is meant by the <b>sources</b> of bodily emissions of a female leper? <b>If we say</b> that this is referring to <b>the rest of her sources,</b> e.g., her saliva and urine, this can be <b>derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a male</b> leper. <b>Rather,</b> it is referring <b>to her blood,</b> and the verse serves <b>to render impure</b> the <b>blood</b> of a leper discharged during the days of <b>her purity.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>Beit Shammai,</b> who maintain the blood is ritually pure, interpret the verse? They contend that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the emissions of <b>a female</b> leper <b>cannot be derived from</b> that of <b>a male</b> leper, <b>as</b> such a comparison <b>can be refuted</b> as follows: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about a male</b> leper? He is unique <b>in that he is required to let his hair grow and rend his garments, and he is prohibited to</b> engage in <b>sexual intercourse.</b> Can <b>you say,</b> then, that the same <i>halakhot</i> should apply to the emissions <b>of a female</b> leper, <b>to</b> whom all the aforementioned requirements do <b>not</b> apply? Consequently, the verse is necessary to teach that the saliva and urine of a female leper are impure.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>Beit Hillel</b> respond? They respond as follows: If the verse serves to include only the saliva and urine of a female leper, then <b>let the Merciful One write</b> this <i>halakha</i> only <b>with regard to a female</b> leper. <b>And</b> there will be <b>no need</b> to write it with regard to <b>a male</b> leper, as <b>I will say</b> that the saliva and urine of a male leper are impure by an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>And what,</b> if with regard to <b>a female</b> leper, <b>who is not required to let her hair grow and rend her garments, and</b> it <b>is not prohibited</b> for her <b>to</b> engage in <b>sexual intercourse, the Merciful One</b> nevertheless <b>includes her sources</b> of bodily emissions as impure, then in the case of <b>a male</b> leper, to whom all the aforementioned requirements apply, is it <b>not all the more so</b> that his emissions are impure?
Therefore, <b>if</b> the phrase “whether it be a male” <b>is not</b> needed for the <b>matter of a male</b> leper, as this <i>halakha</i> may be derived by an <i>a fortiori</i> inference, <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of a female</b> leper. <b>And if it is not</b> needed for the <b>matter of her</b> other <b>sources</b> of bodily emissions, as they are derived from the phrase “or a female,” <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of her blood,</b> i.e., <b>to render impure</b> the <b>blood of her</b> days of <b>purity.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>Beit Shammai</b> respond? They would answer that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the emissions of <b>a male</b> leper <b>cannot be derived</b> by an <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a female</b> leper, <b>as</b> it <b>can be refuted</b> as follows: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about a female?</b> She is unique <b>in that she is rendered impure</b> as a <i>zava</i> even by sightings that occur <b>due to circumstances beyond</b> her <b>control.</b> Can <b>you say</b> that the same <i>halakhot</i> should apply to the emissions <b>of a male,</b> for <b>whom</b> this is <b>not</b> the case?
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>Beit Hillel</b> respond? They respond as follows: Can it be that we are <b>standing</b> and dealing <b>with</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a leper, and</b> Beit Shammai are attempting to <b>refute</b> the <i>a fortiori</i> inference by citing <b>matters</b> pertaining <b>to a <i>zav</i>?</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Beit Shammai?</b> According to Beit Shammai, this is a legitimate refutation of the <i>a fortiori</i> inference, as <b>they refute</b> it through the common <b>name of impurity</b> that applies to both a leper and a <i>zav</i>.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>Beit Shammai</b> could <b>say to you: That</b> phrase <b>“whether it be a male” is necessary to</b> teach another <i>halakha</i>, that the phrase <b>“whether it be a male”</b> serves to include <b>anyone who is a male, whether an adult or a minor,</b> in the <i>halakhot</i> of a <i>zav</i>. <b>And</b> how do <b>Beit Hillel</b> respond? <b>They derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the following verse: <b>“This is the law of the <i>zav</i>,</b> and of him from whom the flow of seed goes out, so that he is unclean through it” (Leviticus 15:32). The verse indicates that the <i>halakhot</i> of a <i>zav</i> apply to any male, <b>whether</b> he is <b>an adult or whether</b> he is <b>a minor.</b>
§ The Gemara mentioned earlier that a minor is included in the <i>halakhot</i> of a <i>zav</i>. In this regard <b>Rav Yosef says: When Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish taught</b> the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of a <i>zav</i>, he raised this dilemma:</b> With regard to the <b>first sighting</b> of <i>ziva</i> <b>of a <i>zav</i></b> who is a <b>minor, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>as to</b> whether <b>it imparts impurity through contact?</b> Does one say that as <b>the Merciful One states: “This is the law of the <i>zav</i>, and of him from whom the flow of seed goes out”</b> (Leviticus 15:32), one’s <i>ziva</i> is thereby compared to his semen?
Accordingly, with regard to <b>any</b> male <b>whose semen imparts impurity, his first sighting</b> of <i>ziva</i> <b>imparts impurity. And</b> with regard to <b>this</b> minor, <b>since his semen does not impart impurity, his first sighting does not impart impurity either. Or perhaps, since if</b> this minor <b>sees two</b> emissions of <i>ziva</i> the first sighting <b>combines</b> with the second sighting to render him impure as a <i>zav</i> for seven days, this indicates that the first sighting of a minor is significant, and consequently it should <b>render him impure</b> until the evening, just like an adult male.
<b>Rava says: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“This is the law of the <i>zav</i>,” whether</b> he is <b>an adult</b> or <b>whether</b> he is <b>a minor.</b> Since the verse equates an adult and a minor, <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>an adult his first sighting imparts impurity, so too,</b> with regard to <b>a minor,</b> his <b>first sighting imparts impurity as well.</b>
The Gemara earlier stated that the phrase “whether it be a male” serves to include the sources of bodily emissions of a male leper, teaching that they impart impurity. In this regard <b>Rav Yosef raises a dilemma:</b> Granted, the first sighting of <i>ziva</i> of an otherwise ritually pure individual imparts impurity only through contact, as stated above, and only the second sighting imparts impurity through carrying. But with regard to the <b>first sighting</b> of <i>ziva</i> <b>of a leper, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>as to</b> whether <b>it imparts impurity</b> even <b>through carrying?</b> Does one say that the <b>place of <i>ziva</i></b> in one’s body <b>is</b> considered <b>a source, and</b> therefore his <i>ziva</i> <b>imparts impurity</b> through carrying, like all the sources of bodily emissions of a leper? <b>Or perhaps</b> the place of <i>ziva</i> <b>is not</b> considered <b>a source,</b> in which case the first sighting of <i>ziva</i> does not impart impurity through carrying.
<b>Rava says: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “When any man has an issue out of his flesh, <b>his issue [<i>zovo</i>] is unclean”</b> (Leviticus 15:2). The verse <b>teaches with regard to the <i>zov</i> that it is impure,</b> and that it imparts impurity through carrying. <b>To what</b> case is the verse referring? <b>If we say</b> it is referring <b>to</b> one who is <b>just a <i>zav</i></b> and not a leper as well, and the verse is teaching that any drop of <i>ziva</i> emitted by him imparts impurity through carrying,

Daf 35a

there is no need for the verse to teach this. After all, if this drop of <i>ziva</i> <b>causes impurity for others,</b> i.e., if the person emitting the drop imparts impurity through carrying, is it <b>not all the more so</b> that the drop <b>itself</b> imparts impurity through carrying? <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the verse is referring <b>to</b> a drop of <i>ziva</i> from <b>a <i>zav</i></b> who is also <b>a leper.</b> And it was necessary for the verse to teach this <i>halakha</i>, as it could not be derived by means of the <i>a fortiori</i> inference. This is because this drop of <i>ziva</i> is not what causes the leper to impart impurity through carrying; rather, it is his leprosy that causes him to impart impurity through carrying.
Rava concludes: <b>And</b> as the verse mentions the word “issue” twice, it is evident that it is referring to a second sighting of <i>ziva</i>. <b>From</b> the fact that <b>a verse was necessary to include a second sighting</b> of <i>ziva</i> of a leper, teaching that his <i>ziva</i> imparts impurity through carrying, <b>conclude from it</b> that the <b>place of <i>ziva</i> is not</b> considered <b>a source.</b> If it were a source, then even the first sighting of <i>ziva</i> would impart impurity through carrying.
<b>Rav Yehuda of Diskarta said to Rava: From where</b> do you know that the verse is referring to a <i>zav</i> who is also a leper? <b>Actually, perhaps I will say to you</b> that the verse is referring <b>to</b> the <i>ziva</i> of one who is <b>just a <i>zav</i>. And</b> as for <b>that</b> <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>that you said:</b> If this drop of <i>ziva</i> <b>causes impurity for others,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> that the drop <b>itself</b> imparts impurity through carrying, one can counter that inference. The case of the <b>scapegoat</b> brought on Yom Kippur <b>will prove</b> that this <i>a fortiori</i> inference is not valid, <b>as it causes impurity to others,</b> since the dispatcher of the scapegoat is rendered ritually impure, <b>and</b> yet the goat <b>itself is pure,</b> as a living animal cannot be rendered impure.
With regard to the dilemma raised by Rav Yosef about the first sighting of <i>ziva</i> of a leper, <b>Abaye said: What</b> is the reason <b>he raises</b> such <b>a dilemma? But it was he who said</b> that when the verse states: <b>“This is the law of the <i>zav</i>”</b> (Leviticus 15:32), it thereby teaches that the <i>halakhot</i> of a <i>zav</i> apply <b>whether</b> he is <b>an adult</b> or <b>whether</b> he is <b>a minor. And since he derives</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from there,</b> the verse: “And of them that have an issue [<i>vehazav</i>] of <i>ziva</i>, whether it be a male or a female” (Leviticus 15:33), <b>remains</b> available <b>for him</b> to derive as follows: <b>“Whether it be a male”</b> serves <b>to include a male leper</b> with regard <b>to his sources</b> of bodily emissions, and “or <b>a female”</b> serves <b>to include a female leper</b> with regard <b>to her sources</b> of bodily emissions.
<b>And</b> as this verse discusses a full-fledged <i>zav</i>, and the word “issue” is mentioned twice, <b>the Merciful One compares a leper to a full-fledged <i>zav</i>: Just as a full-fledged <i>zav</i> imparts impurity through carrying, so too,</b> the <b>first sighting</b> of <i>ziva</i> <b>of a leper imparts impurity through carrying.</b>
§ <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The <b>first sighting</b> of <i>ziva</i> <b>of a <i>zav</i> imparts ritual impurity</b> to one who comes into contact with it, even if the emission occurred <b>due to circumstances beyond</b> his <b>control, as it is stated: “This is the law of the <i>zav</i>, and of him from whom the flow of seed goes out”</b> (Leviticus 15:32). The verse compares the first sighting of <i>ziva</i> to a seminal emission: <b>Just as semen imparts impurity</b> even if it occurs <b>due to circumstances beyond</b> his <b>control, so too,</b> the <b>first sighting of a <i>zav</i> imparts impurity</b> even if it occurs <b>due to circumstances beyond</b> his <b>control.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the statement of Rav Huna: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a mishna (<i>Zavim</i> 2:2): With regard to a man who <b>saw a first sighting</b> of <i>ziva</i>, <b>one examines him</b> to determine whether the discharge was caused by circumstances beyond his control. <b>What, is it not</b> that the purpose of this examination is <b>to</b> clarify that he does not have <b>ritual impurity,</b> i.e., if the discharge was due to circumstances beyond his control he remains pure, which contradicts the statement of Rav Huna? The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> the purpose of this examination is <b>to</b> determine whether he will be obligated to bring <b>an offering</b> if he experiences another two discharges of <i>ziva</i>. If the first sighting was caused by circumstances beyond his control, it is not counted toward the three sightings that render one liable to bring an offering.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the latter clause of the same mishna: <b>When</b> he experiences <b>the second</b> sighting of <i>ziva</i>, <b>one examines him</b> to determine whether the discharge was caused by circumstances beyond his control. <b>For what</b> purpose does one examine him? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>to</b> exempt him from bringing <b>an offering</b> in the event that he experiences a third discharge <b>but not to</b> clarify that he does not have <b>ritual impurity,</b> this is untenable, as one may <b>read here</b> the verse: “An issue <b>out of his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 15:2), from which it is derived that one is <b>not</b> rendered a <i>zav</i> if the discharge occurred <b>due to circumstances beyond his control. Rather, is it not</b> that the examination serves <b>to</b> clarify that he does not have <b>ritual impurity? And from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the examination in <b>the latter clause</b> is <b>for</b> purposes of <b>impurity,</b> one may conclude that the examination of <b>the first clause</b> is <b>also for</b> purposes of <b>impurity.</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Are the cases comparable? This</b> case is <b>as it is, and that</b> case is <b>as it is.</b> In other words, it is possible that each examination is intended for a different purpose. In particular, the first examination is meant to exempt him from bringing an offering, and the second examination pertains to both the offering and ritual impurity.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the same mishna, which states that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Even</b> after <b>the third</b> discharge <b>one examines him, because of the offering.</b> In other words, if the third discharge occurred due to circumstances beyond his control, he is not liable to bring an offering. From the fact that according to Rabbi Eliezer the examination is due to the offering, one may conclude <b>by inference that the first</b> <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying</b> the examinations are <b>for ritual impurity.</b> If so, then according to the mishna one who has an initial discharge of <i>ziva</i> due to circumstances beyond his control remains pure.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> this is not the proper explanation of the mishna. Rather, <b>everyone agrees</b> that the examination serves <b>to</b> exempt him from bringing <b>an offering. And here they disagree with regard to</b> whether one interprets instances of the word <b>“<i>et</i>”</b> in a verse. With regard to a <i>zav</i>, the verse states: “And of them that have an issue of <i>ziva</i> [<i>vehazav et zovo</i>], whether it be a male or a female” (Leviticus 15:33). <b>The Rabbis do not interpret</b> instances of the word <b>“<i>et</i>,” and Rabbi Eliezer interprets</b> instances of the word <b>“<i>et</i>.”</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>The Rabbis do not interpret</b> instances of the word <b>“<i>et</i>.”</b> Therefore, they explain the verse as follows: <b>“<i>Hazav</i>”</b> is referring to <b>one</b> sighting; <b>“<i>zovo</i>”</b> makes <b>two</b> sightings, and when the verse states: <b>“Whether it be a male,”</b> this indicates that <b>for the third</b> sighting <b>the Merciful One compares</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a male <b>to</b> that of <b>a female,</b> i.e., just as a woman is rendered impure even through an emission of <i>ziva</i> due to circumstances beyond her control, so too, the third sighting of <i>ziva</i> by a man renders him impure even if it occurs due to circumstances beyond his control. Accordingly, the Rabbis maintain that there is no need for an examination after the third sighting.
<b>And Rabbi Eliezer interprets</b> instances of the word <b>“<i>et</i>.”</b> Therefore, he explains the verse as follows: <b>“<i>Hazav</i>”</b> is referring to <b>one</b> sighting; <b>“<i>et</i>”</b> makes <b>two</b> sightings; <b>“<i>zovo</i>”</b> totals <b>three</b> sightings. Accordingly, even for the third sighting of <i>ziva</i> one must examine whether it was caused due to circumstances beyond his control. If it was, he is not liable to bring an offering. When the verse states: “Whether it be a male,” this indicates that <b>for the fourth</b> sighting <b>the Merciful One compares</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a male <b>to</b> that of <b>a female,</b> in that it is counted as a sighting even if it occurred due to circumstances beyond his control.
The Gemara attempts to refute the statement of Rav Huna: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: But wasn’t a <i>zav</i> included in</b> the category of <b>one who experienced a seminal emission? Why,</b> then, <b>was he taken out</b> and discussed in a separate passage? In order <b>to be lenient with him and to be stringent with him</b> relative to the <i>halakhot</i> of one who experienced a seminal emission. Rabbi Yitzḥak elaborates: The separate passage serves <b>to be lenient with him, as he is not rendered impure through</b> an emission that occurs <b>due to circumstances beyond</b> his <b>control,</b> unlike one who experienced a seminal emission. <b>And</b> the separate passage serves <b>to be stringent with him,</b>

Daf 35b

<b>as he renders</b> impure the <b>bedding</b> upon which he lies <b>and</b> the <b>seat</b> upon which he sits, like a primary source of ritual impurity, which is not the case for one who experienced a seminal emission.
The Gemara analyzes Rabbi Yitzḥak’s statement: <b>When</b> does this statement apply, i.e., to which sighting of <i>ziva</i> is Rabbi Yitzḥak referring? <b>If we say</b> he is referring <b>to</b> the <b>second sighting</b> this is untenable, for <b>where</b> in the verse <b>was</b> such a person <b>included in</b> the category of <b>one who experienced a seminal emission?</b> After the second sighting one is considered a full-fledged <i>zav</i>. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that he is referring <b>to</b> the <b>first sighting. And</b> yet Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>teaches:</b> The separate passage discussing a <i>zav</i> serves <b>to be lenient with him, as</b> a <i>zav</i> <b>is not rendered impure through</b> an emission that occurs <b>due to circumstances beyond</b> his <b>control.</b> This contradicts the statement of Rav Huna.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>And how can you understand</b> that Rabbi Yitzḥak is referring <b>to</b> the first sighting of <i>ziva</i>? But Rabbi Yitzḥak also says: The separate passage serves <b>to be stringent with him, as he renders</b> impure the <b>bedding</b> upon which he lies <b>and</b> the <b>seat</b> upon which he sits. <b>With the first sighting</b> of <i>ziva</i> <b>is</b> one <b>fit</b> to render impure his <b>bedding or</b> his <b>seat?</b>
<b>Rather, this</b> is what <b>he is saying: Rabbi Yitzḥak says: But wasn’t a <i>zav</i> with</b> his <b>first sighting included</b> in the category of <b>one who experienced a seminal emission? Why,</b> then, <b>was he taken out</b> and discussed in a separate passage <b>with regard to</b> his <b>second sighting?</b> In order <b>to be lenient with him and to be stringent with him.</b> In other words, the passage serves <b>to be lenient with him, as he is not rendered impure</b> through an emission that occurs <b>due to circumstances beyond</b> his <b>control. And</b> it serves <b>to be stringent with him, as he renders</b> impure the <b>bedding</b> upon which he lies <b>and</b> the <b>seat</b> upon which he sits.
With regard to <i>ziva</i>, <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The discharge of <b><i>ziva</i> is similar to water of barley dough.</b> Whereas the discharge of <b><i>ziva</i> comes from dead flesh,</b> i.e., when one’s penis is flaccid, <b>semen comes from living flesh,</b> when one’s penis is erect. Moreover, the discharge of <b><i>ziva</i> is runny, and is similar</b> in appearance <b>to the white of a unfertilized egg.</b> By contrast, <b>semen is viscous, and</b> it <b>is similar</b> in appearance <b>to the white of an egg that is not unfertilized,</b> i.e., a fertilized egg.
§ The mishna teaches that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree with regard to <b>the blood of a woman who gave birth</b> and reached the conclusion of her days of impurity, but <b>did not</b> yet <b>immerse</b> in a ritual bath. Beit Shammai say: The blood does not retain the halakhic status of menstrual blood; rather, it imparts impurity only while moist. And Beit Hillel say: Since she did not immerse in a ritual bath, her blood is considered like that of a menstruating woman, and it imparts impurity whether it is moist or dry.
With regard to this dispute, it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai: Do you not concede with regard to a menstruating woman who did not immerse</b> after seven days <b>and</b> thereafter <b>saw blood, that she is impure</b> as a menstruating woman in every sense? If so, a woman who failed to immerse after childbirth should likewise be impure as a menstruating woman. <b>Beit Shammai said to them: No,</b> this is not a legitimate comparison. Even <b>if you say</b> this is true <b>with regard to a menstruating woman,</b> there the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that even</b> in a case where <b>she immersed and</b> immediately <b>saw</b> blood thereafter, she is <b>impure. Will you say</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>with regard to a woman who gave birth,</b> where the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that if she immersed and</b> then <b>saw</b> blood <b>she is pure?</b> Therefore, even if a woman who gave birth neglected to immerse and experienced bleeding, she is not considered a full-fledged menstruating woman, and the blood does not impart impurity whether it is moist or dry.
Beit Hillel <b>said to</b> Beit Shammai: The <i>halakha</i> of <b>a woman who gives birth as a <i>zava</i> will prove</b> this is in fact a legitimate comparison. A woman who gives birth as a <i>zava</i> may immerse only after experiencing seven clean days. The <i>halakha</i> is <b>that if she immersed</b> in her days of purity <b>and</b> then <b>saw</b> blood <b>after</b> the seven <b>days of counting</b> for <i>ziva</i>, she is <b>pure,</b> as she is in her days of purity. But if <b>she did not immerse and she saw</b> blood, she is <b>impure.</b> If so, the same should apply to a woman who gave birth and did not immerse at the conclusion of her days of impurity: She should be considered a full-fledged menstruating woman as long as she has not immersed.
Beit Shammai <b>said to them: The same is true and</b> this <b>is the refutation,</b> i.e., we maintain that even in the case of a woman who gave birth as a <i>zava</i> and failed to immerse after seven clean days, her blood imparts impurity only while moist. Accordingly, one cannot compare this case to that of a typical menstruating woman.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>disagree</b> with regard to a woman who gave birth as a <i>zava</i> and counted seven clean days but did not immerse? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>And</b> Beit Shammai <b>concede</b> to Beit Hillel <b>in</b> the case of <b>a woman who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>, that</b> any blood <b>she</b> sees <b>imparts impurity</b> whether it is <b>moist or dry?</b>
The Gemara responds: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai disagree with regard to a woman <b>who counted</b> seven clean days for her <i>ziva</i>. In such a case Beit Shammai maintain that any blood she sees imparts impurity only when moist. <b>There,</b> in the mishna, they agree with regard to a woman <b>who did not</b> yet <b>count</b> seven clean days for her <i>ziva</i>. In such an instance, even Beit Shammai concede that her blood imparts impurity whether it is moist or dry.
The Gemara notes: <b>And it is taught</b> likewise in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a woman who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>, who counted</b> seven clean days after the conclusion of her days of impurity <b>but did not</b> yet <b>immerse, and</b> she subsequently <b>saw</b> blood, <b>Beit Shammai follow their opinion</b> with regard to any woman who gave birth and concluded her days of impurity but did not yet immerse, <b>and Beit Hillel</b> likewise <b>follow their opinion.</b> In other words, according to Beit Shammai her blood imparts impurity only while moist, whereas according to Beit Hillel it imparts impurity whether moist or dry.
§ With regard to blood emitted by a woman during her days of purity after childbirth, <b>it was stated</b> that there is a dispute between the Sages. <b>Rav says: It is</b> from <b>one source</b> in a woman’s body that pure and impure blood are emitted, but <b>the Torah rendered impure</b> the blood emitted during her days of impurity <b>and the Torah rendered pure</b> the blood emitted during her days of purity.
<b>And Levi says: There are two sources</b> in a woman’s body. Blood emitted during her days of impurity emerges from one source, while blood emitted during her days of purity emerges from the other, and these two sources are not active simultaneously. Rather, when <b>the</b> source of the <b>impure</b> blood <b>is closed,</b> i.e., following her days of impurity, <b>the</b> source of the <b>pure</b> blood <b>opens,</b> and when <b>the</b> source of the <b>pure</b> blood <b>is closed,</b> at the conclusion of her days of purity, either thirty-three days for a male child or sixty-six days for a female child, <b>the</b> source of the <b>impure</b> blood <b>is opened.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> the opinions of Rav and Levi? The Gemara responds: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to the following cases: A woman who <b>continuously discharges</b> menstrual blood <b>from within seven</b> days of giving birth to a male until sometime <b>after</b> those <b>seven</b> days, during her days of purity; <b>and</b> likewise, a woman who continuously discharges menstrual blood <b>from within fourteen</b> days of giving birth to a female until sometime <b>after</b> those <b>fourteen</b> days, during her days of purity; <b>and</b> a woman who continuously discharges menstrual blood <b>from within forty</b> days of giving birth to a male until sometime <b>after</b> those <b>forty</b> days, i.e., after the conclusion of her days of purity; <b>and</b> a woman who continuously discharges menstrual blood <b>from within eighty</b> days of giving birth to a female until sometime <b>after</b> those <b>eighty</b> days, i.e., after the conclusion of her days of purity.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>According to Rav,</b> who maintains that both pure and impure blood emerge from the same source, in the cases described in <b>the first clause,</b> i.e., if she continuously discharged menstrual blood from within her days of impurity until sometime during her days of purity, one is <b>to</b> be <b>lenient,</b> In other words, any blood emitted during her days of purity is pure, since the Torah rendered it pure. <b>And</b> in the cases described in <b>the latter clause,</b> when the discharge begins during her days of purity and continues until after the conclusion of her days of purity, one is <b>to</b> be <b>stringent,</b> as the Torah deemed impure any blood emitted after her days of purity.
<b>According to Levi,</b> who says that there are two different sources in the body, in the cases described in <b>the first clause</b> one is <b>to</b> be <b>stringent,</b> as the continuous flow of blood indicates this blood is emanating from the source of the impure blood, and the Torah deemed pure only the blood that emerges from the source of the pure blood. <b>And</b> in the cases described in <b>the latter clause</b> one is <b>to</b> be <b>lenient,</b> as the continuous flow of blood indicates this blood is from the source of the pure blood.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the mishna: With regard to <b>the blood of a woman who gave birth</b> and reached the conclusion of her days of impurity but <b>did not</b> yet <b>immerse, Beit Shammai say:</b> The blood is <b>like her saliva and urine,</b> and it imparts impurity only while moist. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> Her blood is considered like that of a menstruating woman, and it <b>imparts impurity</b> whether <b>moist or dry.</b>
It <b>enters your mind</b> to explain <b>that</b> the mishna is referring to a case where a woman’s discharge of menstrual blood <b>ceased</b> during her days of impurity, and she subsequently experienced bleeding after the conclusion of her days of impurity. If so, <b>granted</b> the mishna is clear <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, who said</b> pure and impure blood emanate from <b>one source,</b> as it is <b>due to that</b> reason that Beit Hillel maintain that the blood <b>imparts impurity</b> whether it is <b>moist or dry,</b> since she did not yet immerse. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Levi, who said there are two</b> separate <b>sources, why</b> do Beit Hillel maintain that the blood <b>imparts impurity</b> whether it is <b>moist or dry?</b> After all, blood emitted during her days of purity comes from the source of pure blood.
The Gemara explains that <b>Levi</b> could <b>say to you: Here we are dealing with</b> a woman who <b>continuously discharges</b> menstrual blood from within her days of impurity until sometime during her days of purity. Since the continuous flow of blood indicates that this blood emanates from the source of the impure blood, Beit Hillel rule that it imparts impurity whether it is moist or dry. The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the mishna is dealing <b>with</b> a woman who <b>continuously discharges</b> menstrual blood, <b>what is the reason that Beit Shammai</b> maintain this blood imparts impurity only while moist? Isn’t it evident that it is impure menstrual blood? The Gemara responds: <b>Beit Shammai hold</b> that <b>it is</b> from <b>one source</b> that pure and impure blood emanate, and the Torah deemed pure any blood emitted during her days of purity.
The Gemara questions the opinion of Rav: <b>Granted,</b> the mishna is clear <b>according to Levi,</b> who maintains there are two separate sources, as <b>that is</b> how there is a practical difference <b>between</b> the opinions of <b>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel.</b> Beit Hillel hold there are two sources, and the continuous flow of blood from her days of impurity into her days of purity indicates that the blood emanates from the source of the impure blood, whereas Beit Shammai contend that pure and impure blood emanate from one source, and the Torah deemed pure the blood of her days of purity. <b>But according to Rav, what is</b> the reason for the difference <b>between them?</b>
The Gemara responds: The difference <b>between them</b> is due to their opinions with regard to the significance of the <b>days and</b> the <b>immersion</b> at the conclusion of her days of impurity. <b>As, Beit Shammai hold</b> that <b>the Merciful One rendered</b> the purity of her blood <b>dependent on days,</b> which means that once she begins her days of purity her blood is pure regardless of whether or not she immersed. <b>And Beit Hillel hold</b> that it is dependent <b>on</b> both <b>days and immersion.</b> Accordingly, if she fails to immerse after her days of impurity, any blood she sees is impure.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from the continuation of the mishna: <b>And</b> Beit Shammai <b>concede</b> to Beit Hillel <b>in</b> the case of <b>a woman who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>, that</b> any blood <b>she</b> sees <b>imparts impurity</b> whether it is <b>moist or dry.</b> It <b>enters your mind</b> to explain that <b>here too,</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> a woman’s discharge of menstrual blood <b>ceased</b> during her days of impurity, and she then experienced bleeding during her days of purity. Since she is still a <i>zava</i> at the beginning of her days of purity, the blood imparts impurity whether it is moist or dry.
The Gemara continues: If so, <b>granted,</b> the mishna is clear <b>according to Rav, who said</b> that pure and impure blood emanate from <b>one source,</b> as it is <b>due to that</b> reason that the blood <b>imparts impurity</b> whether it is <b>moist or dry,</b> since she is still a <i>zava</i> and the Torah has not yet deemed her pure. <b>But according to Levi, who said there are two sources, why</b> does the blood <b>impart impurity</b> whether it is <b>moist or dry?</b> Let it be considered like the saliva or urine of a <i>zava</i>, which imparts impurity only when moist.
The Gemara explains that <b>Levi</b> could <b>say to you: Here too,</b> we are dealing <b>with</b> a woman who <b>continuously discharges</b> menstrual blood from within her days of impurity until her days of purity. The continuous flow of blood indicates that the blood emanates from the source of the impure blood. The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the mishna is dealing <b>with</b> a woman who <b>continuously discharges</b> menstrual blood, <b>for what</b> purpose <b>was</b> it <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to teach this <i>halakha</i>? It is obvious that this blood is impure.
The Gemara answers that it <b>was necessary for</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai.</b> The mishna is teaching that <b>even though Beit Shammai say</b> there <b>is one source, and the Merciful One rendered</b> the purity of her blood <b>dependent on days</b> alone, <b>that statement</b> applies only <b>in</b> the case of <b>a woman who only gave birth, as</b> her <b>days</b> of impurity <b>have been completed</b> at this point. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a woman who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>, who requires</b> the <b>counting</b> of seven clean days from the end of her days of impurity, that statement does <b>not</b> apply, and blood emitted before she counted seven clean days imparts impurity whether moist or dry, like the blood of a menstruating woman.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>, which addresses the verse: “If a woman be delivered, and bear a male, then she shall be impure seven days; as in the days of her menstrual sickness she shall be impure” (Leviticus 12:2). The superfluous phrase <b>“her</b> menstrual <b>sickness she shall be impure”</b> serves <b>to include</b> a man <b>who engages in intercourse with her,</b> teaching that he is rendered impure like a menstruating woman and imparts impurity like her.
Furthermore, the phrase <b>“Her</b> menstrual <b>sickness she shall be impure”</b> serves <b>to include the nights;</b> although the verse states: “As in the days,” she is impure during the night as well. Finally, <b>“her</b> menstrual <b>sickness she shall be impure”</b> serves <b>to include a woman who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>,</b> teaching <b>that she must observe seven clean days.</b> The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Granted,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is clear <b>according to Rav, who said</b> there <b>is one source,</b> as it is <b>due to that</b> reason that a woman who gives birth as a <i>zava</i> <b>requires seven clean days.</b>

Daf 36a

<b>But according to Levi, who said there are two sources, why do I</b> need this woman to wait <b>seven</b> clean days? It should be <b>enough</b> for her to wait seven days after experiencing <b>any amount</b> of cleanliness from the conclusion of her days of impurity. After all, according to Levi, once the blood ceases to flow from her days of impurity, any blood emitted thereafter is from the source of pure blood. Consequently, even if she experiences a flow of blood during the seven clean days this should not negate her count.
The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: She requires that</b> the blood flow <b>should stop</b> for <b>any amount</b> of time after her days of impurity, so <b>that</b> she will have entered her days of purity, and consequently, the next seven days <b>will be considered for her as</b> the <b>seven clean</b> days required by a <i>zava</i>.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: There are certain women with regard to whom the <i>halakha</i> is that if they notice an emission of menstrual blood they are deemed impure only from when they saw the blood, and one is not concerned they might have experienced the emission from an earlier time. Two such women are one who is pregnant and one who is nursing. This applies only to a pregnant woman who has been noticeably pregnant for three periods, each thirty days in length, and has not experienced bleeding during the three periods; and to a nursing woman who has been nursing for three periods, each also thirty days in length, and did not experience bleeding during that time. With regard to this the <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>The days of her pregnancy</b> in which she saw no blood <b>count for her toward the days of her nursing</b> in which she saw no blood, to complete three periods, <b>and</b> likewise, <b>the days of her nursing count for her toward the days of her pregnancy.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: <b>How</b> so? If a woman <b>stopped</b> experiencing bleeding for <b>two</b> periods <b>during her days of pregnancy and one</b> period <b>during her days of nursing;</b> or if she did not experience bleeding for <b>two</b> periods <b>during her days of nursing and one</b> period <b>during her days of pregnancy;</b> or if she did not experience bleeding for <b>one and a half</b> periods <b>during her days of pregnancy and one and a half</b> periods <b>during her days of nursing,</b> the days <b>count for her as three periods</b> in which she did not experience bleeding, and if she experiences bleeding she is deemed impure only from the hour that she saw the blood.
The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Granted,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is clear <b>according to Rav, who said there is one source,</b> as it is <b>due to that</b> reason that the woman <b>requires a cessation</b> of menstrual emissions for <b>three periods</b> in order that she may be considered a woman whose menstrual emissions have ceased. <b>But according to Levi, who said there are two sources, why do I</b> need <b>a cessation</b> of menstrual emissions for <b>three periods?</b> Provided the woman’s menstrual emissions cease for <b>any amount</b> of time at the completion of her days of impurity, it should be <b>enough,</b> as any blood she may emit thereafter is pure and should not negate her count of three periods.
The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: She requires that</b> the blood flow <b>should stop</b> for <b>any amount</b> of time at the conclusion of her days of impurity, <b>in order that</b> her days of purity <b>will be counted for her as</b> part of the <b>three periods,</b> even if she experiences bleeding during her days of purity.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> although Shammai and Hillel disagree with regard to all women who experience bleeding (see 2a), as Shammai maintains they are impure only from when they saw the blood while Hillel holds that they assume ritual impurity status retroactively from the last time they examined themselves and were found to be pure, <b>they agree with regard to</b> a woman who <b>sees</b> blood <b>after</b> seeing <b>blood</b> during her days <b>of purity, that it is sufficient for her</b> to be considered impure from the <b>hour</b> of <b>her</b> seeing the blood.
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Granted,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is clear <b>according to Levi, who said there are two sources,</b> as it is <b>due to that</b> reason that <b>it is sufficient for her</b> to be considered impure from the <b>hour</b> of <b>her</b> seeing the blood. In other words, although she experienced bleeding during her days of purity, until this emission she was still considered a woman whose menstrual emissions have ceased. <b>But according to Rav, who said there is one source,</b> if this woman experienced bleeding during her days of purity, she cannot be considered a woman whose menstrual emissions have ceased. If so, <b>why is it sufficient for her</b> to be considered impure from the <b>hour</b> of <b>her</b> seeing the blood? <b>She should be</b> considered <b>impure</b> retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period,</b> like all other women.
The Gemara responds: The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where there is no time</b> between the conclusion of her days of purity and the subsequent emission of blood. In such a situation, she cannot be considered impure retroactively for a twenty-four-hour period, as the previous twenty-four hours are part of her days of purity.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> still, why is she impure only from when she sees the blood? <b>She should be</b> considered <b>impure from examination to examination,</b> i.e., from the last time she examined herself and found that she was pure. The Gemara responds: <b>Since there is no</b> possibility of her being impure retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period,</b> with regard to impurity <b>from examination to examination as well, the Sages did not decree</b> impurity <b>with regard to her.</b>
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a woman who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>, who counted</b> seven clean days after the conclusion of her days of impurity <b>but did not</b> yet <b>immerse, and</b> subsequently <b>saw</b> blood, <b>Beit Shammai follow their opinion</b> with regard to any woman who gave birth and concluded her days of impurity but did not yet immerse, <b>and Beit Hillel</b> likewise <b>follow their opinion.</b> In other words, according to Beit Shammai her blood imparts impurity only while moist, whereas according to Beit Hillel it imparts impurity whether it is moist or dry.
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Granted,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is clear <b>according to Rav, who said there is one source,</b> as it is <b>due to that</b> reason Beit Hillel maintain that the blood <b>imparts impurity</b> whether it is <b>moist</b> or <b>dry.</b> In other words, as she has not yet immersed, the Torah does not deem pure her menstrual emissions. <b>But according to Levi, who said there are two sources,</b> any blood she may emit after counting seven clean days must have come from the source of pure blood. If so, <b>why does</b> it <b>impart impurity</b> whether it is <b>moist or dry?</b>
The Gemara explains that <b>Levi</b> could <b>say to you: I say</b> my opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i> cited above, <b>that</b> Shammai and Hillel <b>agree</b> that with regard to a woman who experiences bleeding after experiencing bleeding during her days of purity, it is sufficient for her to be considered impure from the hour that she saw the blood. That <i>baraita</i> apparently indicates that there are in fact two sources.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that this <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> a woman who <b>continuously discharges</b> menstrual blood from within her days of impurity into her days of purity. Accordingly, the blood she sees during her days of purity is still from the source of impure blood. The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that the woman <b>counted</b> seven clean days.
The Gemara explains: <b>Here we are dealing with a woman who gave birth to a female as a <i>zava</i>,</b> and therefore her days of impurity are two weeks in length. And this is a case <b>where</b> in the <b>first week</b> her menstrual emissions <b>ceased,</b> and in the <b>latter week</b> her menstrual emissions <b>did not cease,</b> and they continued until her days of purity. <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i> <b>holds: The days of her birth,</b> i.e., the days of impurity, <b>in which she does not see</b> blood, <b>count for her toward the counting of her <i>ziva</i>.</b> Accordingly, although she is considered to have counted seven clean days, the blood emitted during her days of purity is from the source of impure blood.
§ With regard to the dispute between Rav and Levi, <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Rav Shemen from Sikhra said to us: Mar Zutra happened to</b> come to <b>our locale, and he taught</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav as a stringency, and the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Levi as a stringency.</b> In other words, if a woman continuously discharges menstrual blood from within her days of purity until sometime after the conclusion of her days of purity, the blood emitted after her days of purity is impure, in accordance with the opinion of Rav. By contrast, if she continuously discharges menstrual blood from within her days of impurity into her days of purity, the blood emitted during her days of purity is impure, in accordance with the opinion of Levi.
<b>Rav Ashi said: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav, whether as a leniency or as a stringency.</b> Likewise, <b>Mareimar taught: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav, whether as a leniency or as a stringency.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav, whether as a leniency or as a stringency.</b>

Daf 36b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to a pregnant woman <b>who experiences</b> labor <b>pains,</b> and they are accompanied by an emission of blood<b>,</b> her status is that of <b>a menstruating woman.</b> If <b>she experienced</b> these <b>pains</b> accompanied by emissions of blood for <b>three</b> consecutive <b>days within the eleven days</b> between periods of menstruation<b>,</b> during which time emissions of blood render a woman a <i>zava</i>, <b>and she rested</b> from labor <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period, i.e.,</b> the pangs subsided<b>, and</b> she then <b>gave birth,</b> it indicates that the emissions were not due to her imminent labor<b>,</b> and <b>this</b> woman <b>is</b> considered <b>one who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> She is considered a <i>zava</i> only if the pangs subsided for a twenty-four-hour period of <b>a night and</b> the following <b>day, like Shabbat evening and its</b> accompanying <b>day.</b> Additionally, she is considered a <i>zava</i> in a case <b>where she rested from the pain</b> of labor <b>but not</b> necessarily <b>from the</b> flow of <b>blood.</b> In other words, the presence of labor pangs determines whether this blood is due to labor or the impure blood of <i>ziva</i>. Accordingly, if the pangs cease for twenty-four hours, she is considered a <i>zava</i> even if blood was discharging continuously from when she experienced her labor pains.
<b>How long</b> before birth <b>is</b> pain attributable to <b>her</b> labor <b>pains,</b> which means that the blood is not considered blood of <i>ziva</i>? <b>Rabbi Meir says: Even forty or fifty days</b> before the birth, any blood she sees during the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> is not considered blood of <i>ziva</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It is <b>sufficient</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies only from within one <b>month</b> of <b>her</b> due date. <b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> Labor <b>pains</b> do <b>not</b> occur <b>more than two weeks</b> before birth. Accordingly, if she experiences bleeding for three consecutive days during eleven days of <i>ziva</i> that occur before this time, she is a <i>zava</i>.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that a pregnant woman who experiences an emission of menstrual blood due to labor pains is considered a menstruating woman. This statement apparently applies to all blood due to labor. The Gemara therefore asks: <b>Is this to say that any</b> woman <b>who experiences</b> an emission due to labor <b>pains is a menstruating woman?</b> But if a woman experiences an emission due to labor pains in the eleven days of <i>ziva</i>, she is not rendered a <i>zava</i>, nor can this render her a menstruating woman.
<b>Rav said:</b> It is correct that a woman who experiences an emission of blood due to labor during the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> is not rendered a <i>zava</i>, or even a lesser <i>zava</i>, who must observe one clean day for the day she experienced an emission. But she is <b>a menstruating woman for</b> one <b>day,</b> i.e., she is prohibited to her husband on the day of the emission, and in the evening she may immerse and become permitted to him. <b>And Shmuel said:</b> It is a rabbinic decree that she must observe a clean day, as <b>we are concerned lest she rest</b> from labor and thereby be rendered a lesser <i>zava</i>, as the cessation of pangs would indicate that her emission was not due to her imminent labor.
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> A woman <b>who experiences</b> labor <b>pains</b> during the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> <b>is nothing,</b> i.e., she is completely pure and is permitted to her husband. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in the mishna that a woman <b>who experiences</b> labor <b>pains</b> is <b>a menstruating woman?</b> This apparently includes all women who experience an emission due to labor, even if it occurs during the eleven days of <i>ziva</i>.
<b>Rava said:</b> The mishna means that if she experienced an emission due to labor <b>during the days of menstruation,</b> she is considered <b>a menstruating woman;</b> if she experienced the emission <b>during the days of <i>ziva</i>,</b> she is <b>pure. And it is taught</b> likewise in a <i>baraita</i>: A woman <b>who experiences</b> labor <b>pains during the days of menstruation</b> is a menstruating woman; if she experiences them <b>during the days of <i>ziva</i>,</b> she is <b>pure.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>How</b> so, i.e., when does an emission during the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> render a woman one who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>? If <b>she experienced</b> labor <b>pains</b> for <b>one day and</b> then <b>rested</b> from labor for <b>two</b> days, and she experienced an emission on all three days; <b>or</b> if <b>she experienced</b> labor <b>pains</b> for <b>two</b> days <b>and rested</b> from labor for <b>one day,</b> and she experienced bleeding on all three days; <b>or</b> if <b>she rested</b> from labor for one day <b>and she</b> then <b>experienced</b> labor <b>pains</b> for one day, <b>and again rested</b> from labor for one day, and she experienced bleeding on all three days; in each of these cases <b>this</b> woman <b>is</b> considered <b>one who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>,</b> as the cessation of labor pains indicates that the emission of blood is not due to her imminent labor.
<b>But</b> if she <b>rested</b> from labor for <b>one day and</b> then <b>experienced</b> labor <b>pains</b> for <b>two</b> days; <b>or</b> if <b>she rested</b> from labor for <b>two</b> days <b>and experienced</b> labor <b>pains</b> for <b>one day; or</b> if <b>she experienced</b> labor <b>pains</b> for one day <b>and</b> then <b>rested</b> from labor for one day, <b>and again experienced</b> labor <b>pains</b> for one day; <b>this</b> woman <b>is not</b> considered <b>one who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>,</b> since the labor pains indicate that the blood is due to her imminent labor. This is <b>the principle of the matter:</b> If she experienced labor <b>pains adjacent to</b> giving <b>birth, this</b> woman <b>is not</b> considered <b>one who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>;</b> if she was <b>resting</b> from labor <b>adjacent to</b> giving <b>birth, this</b> woman <b>is</b> considered <b>one who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>.</b>
<b>Ḥananya, son of Rabbi Yehoshua’s brother, says:</b> In <b>any</b> situation <b>where</b> she experiences an emission due to <b>her</b> labor <b>pains</b> that <b>occur on her third day,</b> she is not a <i>zava</i>. <b>Even</b> if she was in a state <b>of resting</b> from labor for <b>the entire</b> third <b>day,</b> with the exception of one hour of labor pains, <b>this</b> woman <b>is not</b> considered <b>one who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>,</b> since a woman is considered to be resting from labor on the third day only if she was resting for the entire day.
The Gemara asks: The statement that this is <b>the principle of the matter</b> serves <b>to add what?</b> The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to add</b> the ruling <b>of Ḥananya,</b> son of Rabbi Yehoshua’s brother, that for a woman to be considered one who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>, she must have rested from labor for the entire third day.
§ The mishna teaches that if a woman experiences bleeding due to labor pains during the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> she is not considered a <i>zava</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a <i>zava</i>: “And if a woman has an issue of her blood many days” (Leviticus 15:25). The term <b>“her blood”</b> indicates that only <b>her blood</b> that comes <b>due to herself</b> is impure as blood of <i>ziva</i>, <b>but not</b> blood that comes <b>due to</b> her <b>child.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Do you say</b> the verse excludes blood that comes <b>due to</b> her <b>child? Or</b> is it <b>only</b> excluding blood that comes <b>due to circumstances beyond</b> her <b>control? When</b> the verse <b>states: “And if a woman has an issue of her blood,”</b> the inclusion of <i>ziva</i> due to <b>circumstances beyond</b> her <b>control is</b> already <b>stated</b> in the inclusive phrase: Has an issue. If so, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the term <b>“her blood”?</b> The verse is teaching that only <b>her blood</b> that comes <b>due to herself</b> is impure as blood of <i>ziva</i>, <b>but not</b> blood that comes <b>due to</b> her <b>child.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> given that the verse contains both an inclusion and an exclusion, <b>what did you see to deem pure</b> the blood emitted due to <b>the child, and to deem impure</b> the blood she sees <b>due to circumstances beyond</b> her <b>control?</b> Perhaps the opposite is the case, that blood emitted due to circumstances beyond her control is pure, whereas blood caused by labor is impure. The Gemara answers: <b>I deem pure</b> the blood emitted <b>due to the child, as there is</b> a period of <b>purity after it,</b> i.e., her days of purity following her days of impurity; <b>and I deem impure</b> the blood she sees <b>due to circumstances beyond</b> her <b>control, as there is no</b> period of <b>purity after it.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>On the contrary, I</b> should <b>deem</b> the blood <b>pure in</b> a case where it was emitted due to <b>circumstances beyond</b> her <b>control, as</b> an emission of <i>ziva</i> due <b>to circumstances beyond</b> one’s <b>control</b> in the case <b>of</b> a male <b><i>zav</i> is pure.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Now, in any event, we are dealing with</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a woman, and in</b> the case of <b>a woman we do not find</b> that an emission caused by <b>circumstances beyond</b> her <b>control</b> is pure. It is therefore preferable to deem impure an emission caused by circumstances beyond her control, and to deem pure an emission due to childbirth.
The Gemara adds: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>What is your opinion, that</b> one should <b>deem</b> the blood <b>pure in</b> a case where it was emitted due to <b>circumstances beyond</b> her <b>control, and deem</b> the blood <b>impure</b> in a case where it was emitted <b>due to the child?</b> But <b>you have no greater</b> instance of <b>circumstances beyond</b> her <b>control than this,</b> the experience of labor pains.
The Gemara objects: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that the above verse is interpreted in such a manner, then in the case <b>a menstruating woman as well,</b> with regard to whom the verse states: “And a woman, if she has an issue, and her issue in her flesh is blood, she shall be in her menstruation seven days” (Leviticus 15:19), <b>let us say</b> that when the verse states <b>“her issue”</b> this indicates that only <b>her issue</b> that comes <b>due to herself</b> renders her a menstruating woman, <b>but not</b> an issue that comes <b>due to</b> her <b>child.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Do you say</b> that the verse excludes an issue that comes due to her <b>child? Or</b> is it excluding <b>only</b> an issue that comes due to <b>circumstances beyond</b> her <b>control? When</b> the verse <b>states: “And a woman if she has an issue,”</b> the inclusion of an issue due to <b>circumstances beyond</b> her <b>control is</b> already <b>stated.</b> If so, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the term <b>“her issue”?</b> The verse is teaching that only <b>her issue</b> that comes <b>due to herself</b> renders her a menstruating woman, <b>but not</b> an issue that comes <b>due to</b> her <b>child.</b> If the verse can be interpreted in this manner, why does the <i>baraita</i> teach that a woman who experiences labor pains during the days of menstruation is considered a menstruating woman?
<b>Reish Lakish said:</b> The <b>verse states</b> with regard to the days of purity after childbirth: <b>“She shall observe</b> the blood of purity” (Leviticus 12:5). This indicates that <b>you have another</b> instance of an <b>observance that is like this one,</b> i.e., where the woman is not rendered impure by an emission of blood. <b>And which</b> is <b>this</b> other case? <b>This</b> is the case of blood that is emitted due to labor <b>pains during</b> the eleven <b>days of <i>ziva</i>.</b> An emission during the days of menstruation, by contrast, renders the woman a menstruating woman. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that <b>this</b> other case is where a woman has an emission of blood due to labor <b>pains during the days of menstruation,</b> not where she experiences an emission during the days of <i>ziva</i>.
<b>Rather, Shmuel’s father said</b> the <b>verse states: “And she shall be impure two weeks, as in her menstruation”</b> (Leviticus 12:5), <b>and not: As in her <i>ziva</i>. By inference,</b> one may conclude <b>that</b> there is an instance in which an emission of blood that occurs during <b>her</b> days of <b><i>ziva</i></b> is <b>pure. And which</b> case is <b>this? This</b> is the case of blood that is emitted due to labor <b>pains during</b> the eleven <b>days of <i>ziva</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And now that it is written: “And she shall be impure two weeks as in her menstruation,” why do I</b> need the term <b>“her blood”</b> (Leviticus 15:25) from which it is likewise derived that blood emitted due to labor pains during the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> is pure? The Gemara answers: <b>If not</b> for the term <b>“her blood,” I would say</b> the verse is teaching that a woman who gives birth is impure <b>as in her menstruation, and not as in her <i>ziva</i>, and</b> therefore, <b>even</b> if she experienced bleeding during her days of <i>ziva</i> <b>in</b> a state of <b>resting</b> from labor pains, she remains pure. Consequently, the term “her blood” <b>teaches us</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies only if she experiences bleeding due to labor pains.
§ According to Rav, a woman who emits blood during the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> due to labor pains is considered like a menstruating woman for that day, i.e., she is prohibited to her husband until she immerses in the evening. The Gemara relates that <b>Sheila bar Avina ruled</b> in an actual <b>case in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav.</b> The Gemara further relates that <b>when Rav was dying, he said to Rav Asi: Go</b> and <b>hide</b> this <i>halakha</i>, i.e., inform Sheila bar Avina that my ruling is incorrect. <b>And if he does not listen</b> to you, <b>drag him [<i>garyei</i>]</b> to your side with convincing claims. Rav Asi misheard and <b>thought</b> that Rav <b>said to him <i>gadyei</i>,</b> excommunicate him.
<b>After Rav died,</b> Rav Asi went to Sheila bar Avina and <b>said to him: Retract your</b> ruling, <b>as Rav</b> himself <b>retracted his</b> opinion. Sheila bar Avina <b>said to</b> Rav Asi: <b>If it is so, that he retracted his</b> opinion, <b>he would have told me,</b> as I was his student; he would not have sent a messenger to inform me of such a retraction. Consequently, Sheila bar Avina <b>did not listen</b> to Rav Asi. Rav Asi <b>excommunicated him,</b> as he thought that this was Rav’s instruction. Sheila bar Avina <b>said to</b> Rav Asi: <b>But is the Master not afraid of the fire,</b> i.e., of a punishment for offending me?
Rav Asi <b>said to him,</b> linking in a fanciful manner his own name to the various names of an important <i>tanna</i>: <b>I am Isi ben Yehuda, who is Isi ben Gur Arye, who is Isi ben Gamliel, who is Isi ben Mahalalel,</b> and this name alludes to <b>a copper mortar [<i>asita</i>], over which rot has no power,</b> i.e., no harm will befall me. Sheila bar Avina <b>said to</b> Rav Asi: <b>And I am Sheila bar Avina,</b> and my father’s name alludes to <b>an iron pestle [<i>bukhna</i>], which smashes a copper mortar,</b> i.e., harm may befall you through the merit of my ancestors.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Asi fell ill</b> and contracted one sickness after another, so that when <b>he entered the heat</b> of a fever, <b>he exited</b> a sickness where he felt <b>cold,</b> and when <b>he entered into</b> a sickness where he felt <b>cold, he exited the heat</b> of a fever. Eventually, <b>Rav Asi died.</b>

Daf 37a

Immediately upon Rav Asi’s death, <b>Sheila</b> bar Avina <b>went</b> and <b>said to his wife: Prepare for me provisions [<i>zevadata</i>],</b> i.e., shrouds for my burial, as I will soon die. This is in order <b>that</b> Rav Asi <b>will not go and tell Rav matters</b> of criticism <b>about me,</b> that I did not listen to Rav Asi and that I caused his death because I took offense when he excommunicated me. His wife <b>prepared for him</b> the <b>provisions,</b> and <b>Sheila passed away.</b> The biers of Rav Asi and Sheila bar Avina were brought together for burial. Those accompanying the dead <b>saw that</b> the <b>myrtle</b> that was customarily placed on a bier was <b>flying from this bier to that bier. They said: Conclude from it</b> that <b>the Sages,</b> i.e., Rav Asi and Sheila bar Avina, <b>have made peace</b> with one another.
§ The mishna teaches that a woman who experiences an emission of blood due to labor pains is not rendered a <i>zava</i> if she sees the blood in days when she can become a <i>zava</i>, but rather a menstruating woman if she sees the blood on days during which she can be a menstruating woman. In this regard <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> In general, if a <i>zava</i> experiences an emission of blood while counting seven clean days, her count is negated and she must begin a new count of seven clean days. But <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a <i>zava</i> who experienced an emission of blood due to labor <b>pains?</b> Does this emission <b>negate</b> her count <b>with regard to <i>ziva</i>?</b>
Rava elaborates: Does every <b>substance that imparts impurity negate</b> the count of seven clean days? If so, as <b>this</b> emission <b>imparts impurity like</b> blood of <b>the days of menstruation,</b> it negates her count as well. <b>Or perhaps</b> only <b>a substance that causes</b> a woman to become a <i>zava</i> <b>negates</b> her count, <b>and</b> as <b>this</b> blood <b>is not</b> a substance that <b>causes</b> her to become a <i>zava</i> it does not negate her count.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: The case of an emission <b>of <i>ziva</i></b> due to <b>circumstances beyond</b> one’s <b>control will prove</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to this dilemma, <b>as</b> such an emission <b>does not cause</b> one to be rendered a <i>zav</i>, <b>and</b> yet <b>it negates</b> one’s count of seven clean days.
Rava <b>said to him:</b> This is <b>not so [<i>la’ei</i>],</b> as <b>this</b> emission of <i>ziva</i> due to circumstances beyond one’s control <b>is also</b> a substance that <b>causes</b> one to be rendered a <i>zav</i>, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zavim</i> 2:2): With regard to a man who <b>saw a first sighting</b> of <i>ziva</i>, <b>one examines him</b> to determine whether the discharge was caused by circumstances beyond his control. After the <b>second</b> sighting of <i>ziva</i> as well, <b>one examines him.</b> But after the <b>third</b> sighting <b>one does not examine him,</b> as even if the third sighting occurred due to circumstances beyond his control he is nevertheless rendered a <i>zav</i> on its account.
Abaye asked Rava: <b>And according to Rabbi Eliezer, who said: Even</b> after <b>the third</b> discharge <b>one examines him,</b> will you <b>indeed</b> say that <b>since</b> an emission of <i>ziva</i> due to circumstances beyond one’s control <b>does not cause</b> one to be rendered a <i>zav</i>, <b>it does not negate</b> his count? Rava <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>According to Rabbi Eliezer,</b> this is <b>indeed</b> the case.
The Gemara attempts to reject Rava’s explanation of the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Even</b> after <b>the third</b> discharge <b>one examines him</b> to establish whether he must bring an offering, but after <b>the fourth</b> discharge <b>one does not examine him. What, is it not</b> correct to say that as he was already rendered a <i>zav</i> after three discharges, an examination after the fourth discharge is <b>for</b> the matter of <b>negating</b> any clean days counted thus far? If so, Rabbi Eliezer maintains that an emission of <i>ziva</i> due to circumstances beyond one’s control negates one’s count.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> it is possible that the purpose of the examination after the fourth discharge is to determine whether <b>to render impure that drop</b> of <i>ziva</i> such that it imparts impurity <b>through carrying.</b> According to Rabbi Eliezer, the discharge of a <i>zav</i> imparts impurity through carrying, even if the discharge occurred due to circumstances beyond his control.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to the third</b> discharge, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that <b>one examines him,</b> but after <b>the fourth</b> discharge <b>one does not examine him.</b> The reason is as <b>I said,</b> that the purpose of these examinations is <b>to</b> determine liability to bring <b>an offering, and</b> they do <b>not</b> pertain <b>to</b> the matter of <b>negating</b> any clean days counted thus far. Since the fourth sighting does not affect liability to bring an offering there is no need for an examination. Evidently, Rabbi Eliezer maintains that a discharge that occurs due to circumstances beyond one’s control does negate his count.
The Gemara concedes: <b>Rather, according to Rabbi Eliezer,</b> one can <b>resolve</b> the dilemma and conclude <b>that</b> even <b>a substance that does not cause</b> one to be rendered a <i>zav</i> <b>negates</b> one’s count. But <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis?</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear that</b> which <b>the father of Rabbi Avin teaches</b> with regard to the question of why a discharge of <i>ziva</i> causes a <i>zav</i> to negate his entire count of clean days, whereas a seminal emission negates only the day of the emission itself: <b>What</b> did <b>his <i>ziva</i> cause for him?</b> An impurity of <b>seven</b> days. <b>Therefore,</b> a discharge of <i>ziva</i> causes him to <b>negate</b> his count of <b>seven</b> clean days. By contrast, <b>what</b> did <b>his seminal emission cause for him?</b> An impurity of <b>one day</b> alone. <b>Therefore,</b> a seminal emission causes him to <b>negate</b> only <b>one day</b> of his count.
The Gemara analyzes this statement: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the claim that <i>ziva</i> causes an impurity of <b>seven</b> days? <b>If we say</b> it means merely <b>that</b> <i>ziva</i> <b>renders him impure</b> for <b>seven</b> days, then the father of Rabbi Avin <b>should have</b> stated: <b>Just as his <i>ziva</i></b> causes him to be impure for <b>seven</b> days, so too, it negates his count of seven clean days. <b>Rather, is it not</b> that the mention of causation indicates that this is what he is saying: <b>A substance that causes</b> one to be rendered a <i>zav</i> <b>negates</b> one’s count of seven clean days, whereas <b>a substance that does not cause</b> one to be rendered a <i>zav</i>, e.g., an emission of blood due to labor pains, <b>does not negate</b> one’s count. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>conclude from it</b> that this is the opinion of the Rabbis.
With regard to the <i>halakha</i>, <b>Abaye said: We have a tradition</b> that blood emitted by a woman due to labor <b>pains does not negate</b> the seven clean days <b>of <i>ziva</i>,</b> in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis. <b>And if you a find <i>tanna</i> who said</b> that it does <b>negate</b> them, the statement of <b>that</b> <i>tanna</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b>
§ It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Marinus says:</b> In the case of a <i>zava</i> who gave birth in the middle of counting seven clean days, the <b>birth does not negate</b> her count of seven clean days <b>of <i>ziva</i>.</b> With regard to this statement, <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> as to whether her days of impurity <b>may be counted</b> toward the seven clean days of <i>ziva</i>? <b>Abaye says:</b> The birth <b>does not negate</b> her count, <b>but it does not count</b> toward the seven clean days. <b>Rava says:</b> The birth <b>does not negate</b> her count <b>and</b> it also <b>counts</b> toward the seven days.
<b>Rava said: From where do I say</b> that the birth is counted toward the seven days? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “But if she is purified from her <i>ziva</i> then she shall count for herself seven days, <b>and after that she shall be pure”</b> (Leviticus 15:28). The word <b>“after”</b> indicates that she shall be pure only <b>after</b> counting <b>all of them,</b> i.e., <b>that there should not be an impurity separating between</b> any of the seven clean days.
Rava explains: <b>Granted, if you say</b> the birth <b>counts</b> toward the seven clean days, <b>this is</b> in accordance with the requirement <b>that there should not be an impurity separating</b> between any of the seven clean days, as they remain consecutive. <b>But if you say</b> the birth <b>does not count</b> toward the seven clean days, then the <b>birth separates between</b> the seven clean days. The Gemara notes: <b>And Abaye</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means <b>that there should not be an impurity of <i>ziva</i> separating between them.</b> There is no problem with a separation due to birth.
<b>Rava</b> further <b>said: From where do I say</b> that the birth is counted toward the seven clean days? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “But if she is purified <b>from her <i>ziva</i></b> then she shall count for herself seven days” (Leviticus 15:28). This indicates that she counts seven clean days <b>from her <i>ziva</i> and not from her leprosy,</b> i.e., she begins counting seven days from the cessation of her <i>ziva</i>, even if she is a leper. Likewise, she counts seven clean days <b>from her <i>ziva</i> and not from her</b> giving <b>birth,</b> as she counts seven clean days even if they continue through her days of impurity. The Gemara notes: <b>And Abaye</b> could have <b>said to you:</b> From this verse <b>teach one</b> derivation, i.e., <b>from her <i>ziva</i> and not from her leprosy, but do not teach:</b> From her <i>ziva</i> <b>and not from her</b> giving <b>birth.</b>
<b>And Rava</b> would respond: <b>What is this</b> suggestion? <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> taught: <b>From her <i>ziva</i> and not from her</b> giving <b>birth,</b> one can understand why the <i>tanna</i> also teaches: From her <i>ziva</i> and not from her leprosy: <b>Since it was necessary for</b> the <i>tanna</i> to teach this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>birth,</b> he <b>taught</b> it with regard to <b>her leprosy, due to</b> the fact that he taught it with regard to <b>birth. But if you say</b> that the <i>tanna</i> taught only: <b>From her <i>ziva</i> and not from her leprosy,</b> then the verse is unnecessary, as <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> already <b>derived from</b> another verse: <b>“And when the <i>zav</i> is purified of his <i>ziva</i>”</b> (Leviticus 15:13), i.e., <b>from his <i>ziva</i> and not from his leprosy.</b>
<b>And Abaye</b> could respond: <b>One</b> verse discusses the case <b>of a <i>zav</i> and</b> the other <b>one</b> discusses the case <b>of a <i>zava</i>, and</b> both verses <b>are necessary. As, if the Merciful One had written</b>

Daf 37b

this <i>halakha</i> only <b>with regard to a <i>zav</i>,</b> one might have thought that the Torah was lenient solely in the case of a <i>zav</i>, <b>because</b> a <i>zav</i> <b>is not rendered impure</b> on account of an emission that occurs <b>due to circumstances beyond</b> his <b>control. But</b> in the case of <b>a <i>zava</i>, who is rendered impure</b> on account of an emission that occurs <b>due to circumstances beyond</b> her <b>control,</b> one might <b>say</b> this <i>halakha</i> does <b>not</b> apply. It was therefore <b>necessary</b> for the verse to teach that a <i>zava</i> may count her seven clean days even if she is a leper.
<b>And if the Merciful One had written</b> this <i>halakha</i> only <b>with regard to a <i>zava</i>,</b> one might have thought that the Torah was lenient with regard to a <i>zava</i>, <b>because she is not rendered impure through</b> three <b>sightings</b> on one day, <b>as</b> she is <b>through</b> sightings on three consecutive <b>days. But</b> with regard to <b>a <i>zav</i>, who is rendered impure through</b> three <b>sightings</b> on one day, <b>as</b> he is <b>through</b> sightings on three consecutive <b>days,</b> one might <b>say</b> that this <i>halakha</i> does <b>not</b> apply. It was therefore <b>necessary</b> for the verse to teach that a <i>zav</i> may count his seven clean days even if he is a leper.
<b>Abaye says: From where do I say</b> that although the birth does not negate the count of a <i>zava</i>, it does not count toward the seven clean days? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> which addresses the verse: “If a woman be delivered, and bear a male, then she shall be impure seven days; as in the days of her menstrual sickness she shall be impure” (Leviticus 12:2). The superfluous phrase: <b>“Her</b> menstrual <b>sickness she shall be impure,”</b> serves <b>to include</b> a man <b>who engages in intercourse with her,</b> teaching that he is rendered impure as a menstruating woman and imparts impurity like her.
Furthermore, the phrase: <b>“Her</b> menstrual <b>sickness she shall be impure,”</b> serves <b>to include the nights,</b> i.e., although the verse states: “As in the days,” she is impure during the night as well. Finally, the phrase: <b>“Her</b> menstrual <b>sickness she shall be impure,”</b> serves <b>to include a woman who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>,</b> teaching <b>that she must observe seven clean days.</b>
Abaye continues: <b>What, is it not</b> correct that the <i>baraita</i> means she must observe seven days that are <b>clean from</b> the impurity of <b>birth?</b> Evidently, her days of impurity do not count toward her count of seven clean days. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means that these days must be clean <b>of blood.</b> If she does not experience bleeding during her days of impurity, they may be counted toward her seven clean days.
<b>And Abaye said: From where do I say</b> that the birth does not count toward the seven clean days? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the aforementioned verse: The verse compares the <i>halakha</i> of the impurity of birth to the impurity of menstruation, indicating that <b>the days of her menstruation are like the days of her</b> giving <b>birth: Just as the days of her menstruation are unfit for <i>ziva</i>,</b> as a woman may be rendered a <i>zava</i> only through emissions during the eleven days following the seven days of menstruation, <b>and</b> the <b>counting of seven</b> clean days of <i>ziva</i> <b>is not reckoned from them</b> because as long as she remains a <i>zava</i> she cannot be deemed a menstruating woman; <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>the days of her</b> giving <b>birth, which are unfit for <i>ziva</i></b> because a woman cannot be rendered a <i>zava</i> on account of blood emitted due to childbirth, the <b>counting of seven</b> clean days of <i>ziva</i> <b>is not reckoned from them.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>And Rava,</b> who maintains that the days of impurity may be counted toward the seven clean days, could say to you: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who said</b> that not only is the birth not counted toward the seven clean days, it <b>also negates</b> any days counted thus far.
The Gemara analyzes the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>, which compares the <i>halakha</i> of the impurity of birth to the impurity of menstruation, with regard to <i>ziva</i>: <b>But does one derive</b> the <b>possible from</b> the <b>impossible?</b> In other words, how can the <i>halakha</i> with regard to impurity after giving birth be derived from that of the days of menstruation? While it is possible for a woman to give birth as a <i>zava</i>, it is impossible for a <i>zava</i> to simultaneously attain the status of a menstruating woman.
<b>Rav Aḥadevoi bar Ami says:</b> This <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who said</b> that <b>one derives</b> the <b>possible from</b> the <b>impossible. And Rav Sheshet says</b> a different explanation: Although generally one does not derive the possible from the impossible, <b>perforce the verse juxtaposed</b> the days of impurity after birth and those of menstruation, and a juxtaposition in the verse is expounded even if one case is possible while the other is not. <b>Some say</b> a different attribution of these answers, that <b>Rav Aḥadevoi bar Ami says</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> This <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who said</b> that <b>one derives</b> the <b>possible from</b> the <b>impossible. And Rav Pappa says: Perforce the verse juxtaposed</b> the days of impurity after birth and those of menstruation.
§ The mishna teaches that if a woman <b>experienced</b> labor <b>pains</b> accompanied by emissions of blood for <b>three</b> consecutive <b>days</b> within the eleven days between periods of menstruation, and the pangs subsided for a twenty-four-hour period, and she then gave birth, this indicates that the emissions were not due to her imminent labor, and this woman is considered one who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>. Additionally, the mishna states that she is considered a <i>zava</i> in a case where she rested from the pain of labor, but not necessarily from the flow of blood. Accordingly, if the pangs cease for twenty-four hours, she is considered a <i>zava</i> even if blood was discharging continuously.
In this regard, <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If <b>she rested from</b> both <b>this and that,</b> from labor pains and emissions of blood, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that as she rested from labor pains it is evident that the emissions of blood were not due to her imminent labor, and she is <b>ritually impure. Rabbi Ḥanina says</b> that as the emissions of blood also ceased it is apparent that they were due to her imminent labor, and she is <b>ritually pure.</b>
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina says,</b> in explanation of his opinion: Hear <b>a parable;</b> to what is this case comparable? It is comparable <b>to a king who left</b> his palace, <b>and his soldiers</b> left <b>before him.</b> Although the king travels behind them, <b>it is known that they are the soldiers of the king.</b> Likewise, although both the labor pains and the blood subsided, it is clear that the blood she emitted was due to the approaching birth, and therefore she is not a <i>zava</i>.
<b>And Rav Ḥisda says:</b> By the same parable, i.e., assuming that the soldiers arrive before the king, <b>all the more so that</b> there <b>must</b> be <b>many more soldiers</b> accompanying the king upon his arrival. The lack of soldiers before the arrival of the king indicates that they are not in fact soldiers of the king. Likewise, the cessation of labor pains before the birth indicates that the previous emissions of blood were not due to her imminent labor. She is therefore rendered a <i>zava</i>.
The Gemara raises an objection against the opinion of Rav Ḥisda: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> She is considered a <i>zava</i> only if the pangs subsided for a twenty-four-hour period of <b>a night and</b> the following <b>day, like Shabbat evening and its</b> accompanying <b>day.</b> Additionally, she is considered a <i>zava</i> in a case <b>where she rested from the pain</b> of labor <b>but not from the</b> flow of <b>blood.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> she is rendered a <i>zava</i> is <b>that</b> she rested <b>from the pain</b> of labor <b>and not from the</b> flow of <b>blood. But</b> if she rested <b>from</b> both <b>this and that,</b> from labor pains and emissions of blood, she is <b>ritually pure.</b> The mishna is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda.</b>
The Gemara explains that <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> could <b>say to you: It is not necessary</b> to teach <b>that</b> if she rested <b>from</b> both <b>this and that</b> she is <b>impure, as,</b> in terms of the above parable, the king’s <b>soldiers have ceased entirely,</b> i.e., both the labor pains and the blood have completely subsided. <b>But</b> with regard to a case where she rested <b>from the pain but not from the blood,</b> one might <b>say</b> that <b>just as she did not cease</b> emitting <b>blood, so too, she did not cease</b> experiencing labor <b>pains, and</b> the fact <b>that</b> she does not sense any pain <b>is</b> because <b>she was seized by a general disorientation,</b> i.e., she was so weakened by the labor that she was unable to discern pain. Consequently, she should remain pure. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that if she does not feel labor pains, this is indicative that the previous emissions of blood were not due to her imminent labor, and she is a <i>zava</i>.
The Gemara poses a difficulty with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: If a woman <b>experienced</b> labor <b>pains</b> for <b>three</b> consecutive <b>days within the eleven days</b> between periods of menstruation, <b>and she rested</b> from labor <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period, and</b> she then <b>gave birth, this</b> woman <b>is</b> considered <b>one who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the mishna: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the scenario described in the mishna? <b>If we say that</b> it is <b>as is taught,</b> i.e., she rested from labor pains but continued to emit blood, then <b>why do I</b> need for her to experience <b>three</b> days of labor pains accompanied by emissions of blood in order for her to be rendered a <i>zava</i>? If she experienced bleeding <b>during two</b> days <b>of</b> labor <b>pains</b> and <b>one</b> day <b>of resting,</b> it would be <b>sufficient</b> to render her a <i>zava</i>, as she experienced bleeding even on the day she rested from labor pains.
<b>Rather, is it not</b> correct that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> If <b>she experienced</b> labor <b>pains</b> accompanied by emissions of blood for <b>three days and she</b> then <b>rested from</b> both <b>this and that, or if</b> she experienced labor <b>pains</b> for <b>two</b> days <b>and she</b> then <b>rested</b> from labor pains <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period, this</b> woman <b>is</b> considered <b>one who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>? And</b> if so, the mishna is <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina.</b>
The Gemara explains that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina</b> could <b>say to you: No, actually</b> the mishna is to be understood <b>as</b> it <b>is taught,</b> that she experienced labors pains for three days and then rested from the pain but continued to emit blood. <b>And this</b> is what the mishna <b>is teaching us: That even though</b> she <b>began</b> experiencing labor <b>pains</b> at beginning <b>of the third</b> day, <b>and she</b> then <b>rested</b> from labor pains <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> during which she continued to emit blood, <b>she is impure.</b> And this serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> i.e., Ḥananya, son of Rabbi Yehoshua’s brother, who maintains that if a woman experiences labor pains during even part of her third day of experiencing emissions of blood she is not a <i>zava</i>, even if the pain then subsided for a twenty-four-hour period (see 36b).
The mishna teaches: <b>How long</b> before birth <b>is</b> pain attributable to <b>her</b> labor <b>pains,</b> such that the blood is not considered blood of <i>ziva</i>? <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> Even forty or fifty days before the birth. The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> that you have said that even <b>fifty</b> days before the due date a woman can experience labor <b>pains, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to teach that she can experience them <b>forty</b> days before? <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where the mishna states that she can experience labor pains fifty days before birth, it is referring <b>to a sick woman; there,</b> where the mishna states that she can experience labor pains forty days before birth, it is referring <b>to a healthy woman.</b>
§ With regard to the <i>halakha</i> that a woman who experiences labor pains does not contract the impurity of <i>ziva</i>, <b>Rabbi Levi says: The</b> birth of <b>a child renders</b> the mother <b>ritually pure</b> from <i>ziva</i> <b>only</b> if she experienced bleeding during the eleven <b>days that are fit</b> for her <b>to become a <i>zava</i>.</b> But if she experienced bleeding due to labor pains during the days of menstruation that precede or follow those eleven days, she is a menstruating woman. <b>And Rav says: Even</b> if she continued to experience bleeding <b>during</b> the <b>days that are fit for the counting of a <i>zava</i>,</b> i.e., in the seven days following the eleven days of <i>ziva</i>, which are also part of her days of menstruation, she remains pure. <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava says: And according to the reasoning of Rav,</b>

Daf 38a

<b>even</b> if she continues to experience bleeding <b>during</b> the <b>days that are fit for the</b> new <b>counting</b> following <b>the negation</b> of the days counted by <b>a <i>zava</i>,</b> she remains pure. If a woman experiences bleeding during her seven clean days, she negates any days counted thus far, and must begin a new count of seven clean days. Accordingly, all the days that follow her days of <i>ziva</i> are effectively considered days that are fit for the counting of a <i>zava</i>. Therefore, blood emitted due to labor pains during these days is also ritually pure. Consequently, the blood that accompanies labor pains is ritually impure only if she begins to emit it during her days of menstruation.
The Gemara poses a difficulty with regard to the opinion of Levi: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>How long</b> before birth <b>is</b> pain attributable to <b>her</b> labor <b>pains? Rabbi Meir says:</b> Even <b>forty or fifty days</b> before the birth. Rabbi Meir apparently maintains that a woman who experiences continuous labor pains accompanied by emissions of blood for forty or fifty days remains pure.
The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>Granted,</b> the mishna is clear <b>according to Rav,</b> as <b>you find</b> that it is possible that she will remain pure for such a long period, i.e., <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava</b> that Rav deems the blood pure even during the days that are fit for the new counting following the negation of the days counted by a <i>zava</i>. Accordingly, as long as the woman begins to experience labor pains during her days of <i>ziva</i>, she remains pure until birth, provided the labor pains continue without a twenty-four-hour period of resting. <b>But according to Levi,</b> who maintains that blood accompanying labor pains is pure only during the days of <i>ziva</i>, the mishna is <b>difficult,</b> as it is impossible for her blood to remain pure due to labor pains for fifty days.
The Gemara explains that <b>Levi</b> could <b>say to you: Does</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> that she is <b>pure during all</b> these days, i.e., that she remains pure throughout the days of menstruation and <i>ziva</i>? Not so. Rather, if she emitted blood due to labor pains <b>during the days of menstruation</b> she has the status of <b>a menstruating woman,</b> whereas if she emitted the blood <b>during the days of <i>ziva</i></b> she is <b>pure.</b> The mishna is teaching only that she will not be deemed a <i>zava</i> on account of this blood.
Some Sages <b>state another version</b> of the above disagreement: <b>Rabbi Levi says: The</b> birth of <b>a child renders</b> the mother <b>ritually pure only</b> if she experienced bleeding during the eleven <b>days that are fit</b> for her <b>to become a greater <i>zava</i>,</b> i.e., if she experienced bleeding on three consecutive days during that time. But if she experienced bleeding on only one or two days she is rendered a lesser <i>zava</i>, and she must observe a clean day for each day she experiences a discharge. <b>What is the reason?</b> It <b>is written:</b> “And if a woman has an issue of <b>her blood many days</b>…all the days of the issue of her impurity she shall be as in the days of her menstruation: She is impure” (Leviticus 15:25). The verse is referring specifically to a greater <i>zava</i>, indicating that the <i>halakha</i> that a woman is not rendered a <i>zava</i> on account of an emission of blood caused by labor pains applies only to a greater <i>zava</i>.
<b>Abba Shaul says in the name of Rav:</b> The birth of a child renders the mother ritually pure <b>even</b> if she experienced bleeding on the <b>days that are fit</b> for her <b>to become a lesser <i>zava</i>. What is the reason? “Days” and “many days” are written there,</b> from which the impurity of a lesser <i>zava</i> is derived. Accordingly, the verse includes a lesser <i>zava</i> in this <i>halakha</i> as well.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>How long</b> before birth <b>is</b> pain attributable to <b>her</b> labor <b>pains? Rabbi Meir says: Even forty or fifty days</b> before the birth. Rabbi Meir apparently maintains that a woman who experiences continuous labor pains accompanied by emissions of blood for forty or fifty days remains pure. If so, the mishna is <b>difficult according to both</b> opinions, as all agree that only emissions of blood due to labor pains that occur during her days of <i>ziva</i> are pure. The Gemara responds: <b>Does</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> that <b>she is pure during all</b> fifty days? Not so. Rather, if <b>she experienced</b> labor <b>pains</b> accompanied by emissions of blood <b>during the days of menstruation</b> she has the status of <b>a menstruating woman,</b> whereas if she experienced them <b>during the days of <i>ziva</i> she is pure.</b>
With regard to the above statement of Rabbi Meir, it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: There is</b> a scenario in which a woman <b>experiences</b> labor <b>pains</b> accompanied by emissions of blood for <b>one hundred and fifty days, and</b> the impurity of <b><i>ziva</i> is not included in those</b> days, i.e., she will not be rendered a greater <i>zava</i>. <b>How</b> so? First, a woman emits blood for <b>two</b> days <b>not at the time</b> of her menstruation, e.g., she experiences bleeding on the tenth and eleventh days of <i>ziva</i>. She is not rendered a menstruating woman by these emissions, as they occurred during the days of <i>ziva</i>, nor does she become a greater <i>zava</i>, since she experienced bleeding on only two days.
Rabbi Meir continues: <b>And</b> then she continues to experience bleeding throughout the <b>seven</b> days of <b>menstruation.</b> She is not considered to have experienced bleeding of <i>ziva</i> for three consecutive days, as the third emission occurred during her days of menstruation. <b>And</b> she then experiences bleeding for the first <b>two</b> days <b>after the</b> days of <b>menstruation,</b> i.e., on the first and second days of the eleven days of <i>ziva</i>. <b>And</b> on the third day of <i>ziva</i> she begins the period of <b>fifty</b> days before giving birth, during <b>which the child renders</b> her <b>pure.</b> This constitutes a period of sixty-one days during which she is not rendered a greater <i>zava</i>.
Rabbi Meir continues: <b>And</b> this period is followed by <b>eighty</b> days <b>of</b> purity from <i>ziva</i> after giving birth to <b>a female,</b> for a total of 141 days during which she does not become a greater <i>zava</i> on account of blood emitted. <b>And</b> there are then <b>seven</b> days of <b>menstruation</b> following her days of purity, <b>and</b> another <b>two</b> days <b>after the</b> days of <b>menstruation,</b> i.e., the first and second days of <i>ziva</i>, during which she experiences bleeding, for a total of 150 days during which she does not become a greater <i>zava</i> on account of blood emitted.
The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Meir: <b>If so, there is</b> also a scenario in which a woman <b>experiences</b> emissions of blood due to labor <b>pains</b> for <b>all the days of her</b> life, <b>and</b> the impurity of <b><i>ziva</i> is not included in them.</b> For example, she gives birth to a female, and at the conclusion of her days of impurity engages in intercourse with her husband and becomes pregnant. She continues to experience bleeding throughout her days of purity, after which she experiences bleeding during the seven days of menstruation and the first two days of the next cycle of <i>ziva</i>. She then experiences labor pains accompanied by blood for fifty days, after which she miscarries a female. She subsequently becomes pregnant again within eighty days of the miscarriage, and the above process repeats itself. In this manner, she will never become a greater <i>zava</i>.
Rabbi Meir <b>said to them: What is your opinion,</b> that a woman is not rendered a <i>zava</i> <b>due to</b> the birth of <b>non-viable newborns?</b> The <i>halakha</i> that blood emitted due to labor <b>pains</b> does not render a woman a <i>zava</i> does <b>not</b> apply <b>to non-viable newborns.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There is</b> a scenario in which a woman <b>sees</b> blood for <b>one hundred days, and</b> the impurity of greater <b><i>ziva</i> is not included in them. How</b> so? She emits blood for <b>two</b> days <b>not at the time</b> of her menstruation, <b>and</b> then throughout the <b>seven</b> days of <b>menstruation, and</b> then for the first <b>two</b> days <b>after the</b> days of <b>menstruation. And</b> this period is followed by <b>eighty</b> days <b>of</b> purity from <i>ziva</i> after giving birth to <b>a female, and seven</b> days of <b>menstruation</b> following her days of purity, <b>and</b> another <b>two</b> days <b>after the</b> days of <b>menstruation.</b> This amounts to one hundred days.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>teaching us?</b> The Gemara responds: The <i>baraita</i> serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion of <b>the one who said</b> that <b>it is impossible for</b> there to be <b>an opening of the womb [<i>hakever</i>] without</b> an emission of <b>blood.</b> According to this opinion, if a woman gives birth after experiencing bleeding on the first two days after the days of menstruation, it is certain she experienced bleeding on the third day as well, as every birth is accompanied by an emission of blood. Consequently, she has experienced bleeding on three consecutive days during the days of <i>ziva</i> and is rendered a greater <i>zava</i>. The <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us that it is possible for</b> there to be <b>an opening of the womb without</b> an emission of <b>blood.</b> Therefore, if she gave birth on the third day of <i>ziva</i> and she did not experience bleeding, she is not rendered a greater <i>zava</i>.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It is <b>sufficient</b> that a woman is not rendered a <i>zava</i> on account of blood that is emitted due to labor pains only from within one month of her due date. In this regard, it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Tarfon:</b> It is <b>sufficient for her</b> not to be rendered a <i>zava</i> from within one <b>month</b> of <b>her</b> due date. <b>And there is</b> an aspect of <b>leniency and</b> an aspect of <b>stringency in the matter.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>How</b> so? If <b>she experienced</b> labor <b>pains</b> accompanied by an emission of blood for <b>two</b> days <b>at the end of</b> her <b>eighth</b> month of pregnancy, which are days in which she can be rendered a <i>zava</i>, <b>and</b> for <b>one</b> day <b>at the beginning of</b> her <b>ninth</b> month, then <b>even</b> if she <b>gave birth</b> at <b>the beginning of</b> the <b>ninth</b> month, the one day from the ninth month joins together with the two days from the eighth month, and <b>this</b> woman is considered <b>one who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>.</b> This is an aspect of stringency.
<b>But</b> if <b>she experienced</b> labor <b>pains</b> accompanied by an emission of blood for <b>one day at the end of</b> her <b>eighth</b> month, <b>and</b> for only <b>two</b> days <b>at the beginning of</b> her <b>ninth</b> month, then <b>even</b> if she <b>gave birth at the end of</b> the <b>ninth</b> month, <b>this</b> woman <b>is not</b> considered <b>one who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>,</b> and she is pure. This is an aspect of leniency.
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava says: Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that the blast of <b>the shofar</b> at the beginning of the ninth month <b>causes</b> the blood emitted during that month to be pure. That is to say, once the ninth months begins, any blood emitted does not render her a <i>zava</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so,</b> that the entire ninth month of pregnancy is suitable for giving birth, and therefore any blood seen during the ninth month is attributed to the imminent labor? <b>But doesn’t Shmuel say</b> that <b>a woman becomes pregnant and gives birth only after 271 days,</b> which is a full nine months, <b>or after 272 days, or after 273</b> days? She will not, however, give birth during the ninth month itself.
The Gemara responds: Shmuel <b>said</b> his statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the early</b> generations of <b>pious</b> men. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The early</b> generations of <b>pious</b> men <b>would engage in sexual intercourse only on a Wednesday, so that their wives should not come</b>

Daf 38b

<b>to a desecration of Shabbat.</b> If they were to engage in sexual intercourse on a Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday, their wives might give birth on Shabbat, either 271, 272, or 273 days after conception either. The Gemara asks: If this was indeed the concern of the early generations of pious men, why would they engage in intercourse only <b>on a Wednesday, and nothing more?</b> After all, if they engaged in intercourse on a Thursday, Friday, or Shabbat, they would likewise avoid any desecration of Shabbat. The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means that the early generations of pious men would engage in intercourse each week only <b>from Wednesday onward.</b>
<b>Mar Zutra said: What is the reasoning of the early</b> generations of <b>pious</b> men, who state that a woman does not give birth before 271 days have passed from the time of insemination? <b>As it is written</b> with regard to Boaz and Ruth: “And he went in unto her, <b>and the Lord gave her conception [<i>herayon</i>]”</b> (Ruth 4:13). The letters that constitute the word <b><i>herayon</i> are 271 in numerical value.</b>
<b>Mar Zutra says: Even according to the one who said,</b> e.g., Shmuel and the early generations of pious men, that a woman <b>who gives birth at nine</b> months <b>does not give birth after an incomplete</b> number of months, i.e., she carries for a full nine months, nevertheless, a woman <b>who gives birth at seven months can give birth after an incomplete</b> number of months. <b>As it is stated</b> with regard to the birth of Samuel: <b>“And it came to pass, when the seasons of the days had come, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son”</b> (I Samuel 1:20). <b>The minimal</b> number of <b>“seasons”</b> is <b>two,</b> and as each season of the year is three months, this amounts to six months. And <b>the minimal</b> number of <b>“days” is two.</b> If so, Samuel was born in the seventh month of Hannah’s pregnancy.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> Labor <b>pains</b> do <b>not</b> occur <b>more than two weeks</b> before birth. <b>Shmuel said: What is the reasoning of the Rabbis,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon? <b>As it is written</b> with regard to a woman who gives birth to a female: <b>“And she shall be impure two weeks, as in her menstruation”</b> (Leviticus 12:5). The verse indicates that she is impure <b>as in her menstruation but not as in her <i>ziva</i>. By inference,</b> one may conclude <b>that her <i>ziva</i> is pure,</b> i.e., if she emits blood accompanied by labor pains she is not rendered a <i>zava</i>. <b>And</b> for <b>how</b> long is this the case? For <b>two weeks.</b>
With regard to the <i>halakha</i> that blood emitted due to labor pains does not impart impurity of <i>ziva</i>, <b>the Sages taught: There is</b> a scenario in which a woman <b>experiences</b> labor <b>pains</b> accompanied by emissions of blood for <b>twenty-five days</b> before birth, <b>and</b> the impurity of greater <b><i>ziva</i> is not included in them. How</b> so? She emits blood for <b>two</b> days <b>not at the time</b> of her menstruation, i.e., on the tenth and eleventh days of <i>ziva</i>, <b>and</b> then for the <b>seven</b> days of <b>menstruation, and</b> then for the first <b>two</b> days of <i>ziva</i> <b>that</b> come <b>after</b> the days of <b>menstruation. And</b> this period is followed by <b>fourteen</b> days during <b>which the</b> impending birth of <b>a child renders pure</b> the blood she sees.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And it is impossible for</b> a woman <b>to experience</b> labor <b>pains</b> accompanied by emissions of blood for <b>twenty-six days without a child,</b> such that <b>she will not be</b> a woman <b>who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>.</b> Since a span of twenty-six days includes at least five days of <i>ziva</i>, there will inevitably be three consecutive days of <i>ziva</i> during which she experienced bleeding, therefore rendering her a greater <i>zava</i>.
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: Is the <i>baraita</i> really dealing with a case <b>without a child,</b> i.e., where she is not even pregnant? If there is no child, then experiencing bleeding <b>on three</b> consecutive days after the days of menstruation <b>is also sufficient</b> to render her a greater <i>zava</i>. <b>Rav Sheshet said</b> one should <b>say</b> the <i>baraita</i> as follows: Twenty-six days <b>in a case where there is a child,</b> i.e., where she is pregnant. <b>Rava said to</b> Rav Sheshet: <b>But</b> the <i>baraita</i> explicitly <b>teaches: Without a child.</b>
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: It is impossible for</b> a woman <b>to experience</b> labor <b>pains</b> accompanied by emissions of blood for <b>twenty-six days in a case where there is a child,</b> such that <b>she will not be</b> a woman <b>who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>. And in a case where there is no child</b> born <b>but</b> there is <b>a non-viable newborn, with three</b> consecutive days of emissions <b>she also becomes a <i>zava</i>. What is the reason?</b> The <i>halakha</i> that blood emitted due to labor <b>pains</b> does not render a woman a <i>zava</i> does <b>not</b> apply <b>to non-viable newborns.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A woman <b>who experiences</b> labor <b>pains within eighty</b> days <b>of</b> giving birth to <b>a female,</b> e.g., she conceived during the sixty-six days of purity, or she initially conceived twins and she gave birth to a female and the birth of the second fetus was delayed, <b>all blood that she sees is ritually pure,</b> as she is currently within her days of purity. And this remains the <i>halakha</i> <b>until the child emerges</b> from the womb, at which point she is rendered impure as a woman who gives birth. <b>And Rabbi Eliezer deems ritually impure</b> the blood that occurs due to these labor pains.
The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Eliezer: And what,</b> if <b>in an instance where</b> the verse <b>was stringent with regard to blood</b> emitted while <b>resting,</b> namely if a pregnant woman emits blood after her days of purity without any labor pains she is rendered impure, the verse <b>was lenient with regard to blood</b> that accompanies <b>the</b> labor <b>pains;</b> then in <b>an instance where</b> the verse <b>was lenient with regard to blood</b> emitted while <b>resting,</b> i.e., during a woman’s days of purity, <b>is it not right that we will be lenient with regard to blood</b> that accompanies <b>the</b> labor <b>pains?</b>
Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to them:</b> When deriving a <i>halakha</i> by means of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference, there is a principle that <b>it is sufficient for the</b> conclusion that <b>emerges from</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference to be like</b> its <b>source.</b> In other words, the status of blood emitted due to labor pains during her days of purity should not be more lenient than that of blood emitted due to labor pains after her days of purity. Rabbi Eliezer elaborates: <b>Concerning what</b> type of impurity <b>was</b> the verse <b>lenient with regard to</b> a woman who experiences an emission of blood due to labor pains? <b>Concerning the impurity of <i>ziva</i>. But she</b> may still be rendered <b>ritually impure</b> with <b>the impurity of a menstruating woman.</b> So too, if a woman experiences emissions of blood due to labor pains during her days of purity, she is rendered a menstruating woman.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis concerning a woman who emits blood due to labor pains during her days of purity, <b>the Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> that addresses a verse discussing a woman who gives birth to a female: “And sixty-six days she shall observe the blood of purity” (Leviticus 12:5). The term <b>“She shall observe”</b> serves <b>to include</b> a woman <b>who experiences</b> labor <b>pains within eighty</b> days <b>of</b> giving birth to <b>a female,</b> teaching <b>that all blood that she sees is ritually pure.</b> And this remains the case <b>until the child emerges</b> from the womb. <b>And Rabbi Eliezer deems ritually impure</b> the blood that occurs due to these labor pains.
The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Eliezer: And what,</b> if <b>in an instance where</b> the verse <b>was stringent with regard to</b> blood that is emitted while <b>resting before</b> the birth of <b>the child,</b> as such blood renders her a <i>zava</i>, the verse <b>was lenient with regard to</b> blood that is emitted while <b>resting after</b> the birth of <b>the child,</b> i.e., during her days of purity; then in <b>an instance where</b> the verse <b>was lenient with regard to</b> blood emitted due to labor <b>pains before</b> the birth of <b>the child, is it not right that we will be lenient with regard to</b> blood that is emitted due to labor <b>pains after</b> the birth of <b>the child?</b>
Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to them: It is sufficient for the</b> conclusion that <b>emerges from</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference to be like</b> its <b>source.</b> Rabbi Eliezer elaborates: <b>Concerning what</b> type of impurity <b>was</b> the verse <b>lenient with regard to</b> a woman who experiences an emission of blood due to labor pains? <b>Concerning the impurity of <i>ziva</i>. But</b> an emission of blood <b>renders her impure</b> with <b>the impurity of a menstruating woman.</b> So too, if a woman experiences emissions of blood due to labor pains during her days of purity, she is rendered a menstruating woman.
The Rabbis <b>said to him: But we</b> will <b>respond to you</b> with <b>another version</b> of the <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>And what,</b> if <b>in an instance where</b> the verse <b>was stringent with regard to</b> blood that is emitted while <b>resting before</b> the birth of <b>the child</b> the verse <b>was lenient with regard to</b> blood that is emitted due to labor <b>pains that</b> come <b>with it,</b> i.e., which precede the birth of the child; then in <b>an instance where</b> the verse <b>was lenient with regard to</b> blood emitted while <b>resting,</b> namely during a woman’s days of purity, <b>is it not right that we will be lenient with regard to</b> blood that accompanies <b>the</b> labor <b>pains that</b> come <b>with it?</b>
Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to them: Even</b> if <b>you respond</b> by citing <i>a fortiori</i> inferences of that type throughout <b>the entire day,</b> the principle remains that <b>it is sufficient for the</b> conclusion that <b>emerges from</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference to be like</b> its <b>source. Concerning what</b> type of impurity <b>was</b> the verse <b>lenient with regard to</b> a woman who experiences an emission of blood due to labor pains? <b>Concerning the impurity of <i>ziva</i>. But</b> an emission of blood <b>renders her impure</b> with <b>the impurity of a menstruating woman.</b>
<b>Rava said: With this</b> response <b>Rabbi Eliezer triumphed over the Rabbis: Didn’t you say</b> that the reason why a woman is not rendered a <i>zava</i> on account of blood that is emitted due to labor pains before birth is because the verse states: “And if a woman has an issue of her blood many days” (Leviticus 15:25)? The term <b>“her blood”</b> indicates that only <b>her blood</b> that comes <b>due to herself</b> is impure due to <i>ziva</i>, <b>but not</b> blood that comes <b>due to</b> her <b>child. So too,</b> one can say that as the verse states with regard to a woman who gives birth: <b>“And she shall be purified from the fountain of her blood”</b> (Leviticus 12:7), this indicates that only <b>her blood</b> that comes <b>due to herself</b> is pure from <i>ziva</i>, <b>but not</b> blood that comes <b>due to</b> her <b>child.</b>
This Gemara raises a difficulty against the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer: If so, one can <b>say</b> that if she emits blood due to labor pains <b>during the days of menstruation</b> she is <b>a menstruating woman,</b> but if she emits blood <b>in the days of <i>ziva</i>,</b> i.e., after the days of menstruation, she is <b>pure.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>the verse states: “She shall observe</b> the blood of purity” (Leviticus 12:5), which indicates that there is <b>one observance for all</b> the days of her purity, i.e., all the blood she emits due to labor pains during her days of purity is either pure or impure.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> For <b>all</b> the <b>eleven days</b> of <i>ziva</i> that follow the seven days of menstruation, a woman <b>has the presumptive status of ritual purity,</b> as it is unusual for her to experience bleeding on these days.

Daf 39a

If a woman <b>sat and did not examine</b> herself every morning and evening to determine whether she emitted blood and is impure, it makes no difference whether she failed to examine herself <b>unwittingly</b> or due to <b>circumstances beyond her control,</b> or even if she acted <b>intentionally and did not examine</b> herself; she remains <b>ritually pure.</b> She is rendered impure only if she examined herself and was found to have emitted blood.
By contrast, if <b>the time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle arrived,</b> when she is required to examine herself, <b>and she did not examine</b> herself, <b>that</b> woman <b>is ritually impure,</b> as it is typical for a woman to discharge blood at that time. <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> If a woman <b>was in hiding</b> from danger, <b>and the time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle arrived and she did not examine</b> herself on that day, <b>that</b> woman <b>is pure, because fear drives away blood.</b> There is therefore no concern that she might have emitted blood.
<b>But</b> with regard to the seven clean <b>days of the <i>zav</i> and the <i>zava</i>, and</b> with regard to a woman who <b>observes</b> a clean <b>day for a day</b> she experiences a discharge during her days of <i>ziva</i>, if she fails to examine herself on those days, <b>these</b> women <b>have a presumptive status of ritual impurity,</b> as they already experienced a discharge.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that throughout the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> that follow the seven days of menstruation, a woman has the presumptive status of ritual purity. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is this stated? <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> This serves <b>to say that she does not require an examination</b> during these days. The Gemara objects: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause teaches:</b> If <b>she sat and did not examine</b> herself she remains ritually pure, <b>it can be inferred that she requires examination <i>ab initio</i>.</b>
The Gemara explains: In <b>the latter clause we arrive at</b> the case of a woman who is in the <b>days of menstruation,</b> not in the days of <i>ziva</i>. <b>And this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> For <b>all</b> the <b>eleven days</b> of <i>ziva</i> that follow the days of menstruation, a woman <b>has the presumptive status of ritual purity and she does not require examination. But during the days of her menstruation she requires examination.</b> Nevertheless, if <b>she sat and did not examine</b> herself, whether <b>unwittingly</b> or due to <b>circumstances beyond her control,</b> or even if she acted <b>intentionally and did not examine</b> herself, she remains <b>ritually pure.</b>
<b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> a different answer: The first clause of the mishna <b>is necessary only for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who said:</b> With regard to <b>a woman who does not have</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle,</b> she is <b>forbidden to engage in intercourse,</b> lest she emit blood during intercourse. The mishna is teaching that <b>this statement</b> applies only <b>during the days of her menstruation, but during the days of her <i>ziva</i></b> even Rabbi Meir concedes that she <b>stands in</b> her <b>presumptive status of purity</b> and may engage in intercourse with her husband.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that even according to Rabbi Meir there are days in which a woman who does not have a fixed menstrual cycle is permitted to engage in sexual intercourse with her husband, <b>why did Rabbi Meir say</b> that her husband <b>must divorce</b> her <b>and he may never take</b> her <b>back,</b> even if she eventually develops a fixed menstrual cycle? Let them engage in intercourse during the eleven days of <i>ziva</i>. The Gemara answers: He must divorce her <b>lest</b> the matter <b>lead to failure during the days of menstruation,</b> i.e., in case they come to engage in intercourse during the days of menstruation, when she might experience regular menstrual bleeding.
The Gemara objects: But <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause teaches:</b> If <b>the time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle arrived and she did not examine</b> herself, that woman is ritually impure, <b>it can be inferred that we are dealing with a woman who has</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle.</b> The Gemara explains: The mishna <b>is incomplete and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching:</b> For <b>all</b> the <b>eleven</b> days of <i>ziva</i> that follow the days of menstruation, a woman <b>has the presumptive status of ritual purity and she is permitted to her husband, but during the days of menstruation she is prohibited</b> to her husband.
<b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? In</b> the case of <b>a woman who does not have</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle,</b> where there is a concern she might experience bleeding during any of the days of menstruation. <b>But</b> in the case of a woman who <b>has</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle, she is permitted</b> to engage in sexual intercourse with her husband, <b>and she requires examination.</b> Nevertheless, if <b>she sat and did not examine</b> herself, whether <b>unwittingly</b> or due to <b>circumstances beyond her control,</b> or even if she acted <b>intentionally and did not examine</b> herself, she remains <b>ritually pure.</b> If <b>the time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle arrived and she did not examine</b> herself, she is <b>impure.</b>
The Gemara objects: But <b>from</b> the fact that <b>the last clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> it can be inferred that <b>the first clause</b> is <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>the entire</b> mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and this</b> is what it <b>is saying: If she was not in hiding and the time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle arrived and she did not examine</b> herself, she is <b>impure, as Rabbi Meir says:</b> If a woman <b>was in hiding and the time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle arrived and she did not examine</b> herself, she is <b>pure, as fear drives away blood.</b>
<b>Rava says</b> a different explanation of the first clause of the mishna: The mishna is coming <b>to say that</b> if a woman experiences bleeding during the eleven days of <i>ziva</i>, as she previously had the presumptive status of purity <b>she does not impart impurity</b> retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> to any ritually pure items she touched. It is assumed that she did not emit any blood before this emission.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a menstruating woman, and a <i>zava</i>, and a woman who observes a day for a day, and a woman who gave birth, they all impart impurity</b> retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period.</b> A woman who observes a day for a day is one who experiences bleeding for one or two days during her days of <i>ziva</i>, and the <i>baraita</i> teaches that even such a woman imparts impurity retroactively for a twenty-four-hour period. If so, this is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of Rava’s explanation.
<b>Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya says</b> another explanation of the first clause of the mishna in the name of <b>Shmuel:</b> The mishna is coming <b>to say that</b> a woman <b>does not fix</b> a menstrual <b>cycle for herself during the days of her <i>ziva</i>.</b> In other words, a sighting during these days does not combine with sightings during the previous two periods of <i>ziva</i> to establish a fixed menstrual cycle. The Gemara relates that this statement was recited before <b>Rav Yosef,</b> who <b>said: I did not hear this <i>halakha</i></b> from Shmuel.
<b>Abaye said to him:</b> But <b>you</b> yourself <b>told us</b> this <i>halakha</i>, <b>and</b> it was <b>with regard to that</b> mishna <b>you told</b> it to <b>us,</b> as we learned in a mishna (63b): If the woman <b>was accustomed to see</b> an emission of blood on the <b>fifteenth day,</b> so that this was her fixed menstrual cycle, <b>and she deviated</b> from her cycle <b>to</b> see an emission on the <b>twentieth day,</b> then on both <b>this</b> day, the fifteenth, <b>and that</b> day, the twentieth, it is <b>prohibited</b> for her to engage in sexual intercourse due to the concern that she might have an emission on either day. If <b>she deviated</b> from her cycle <b>twice, to</b> see an emission on the <b>twentieth day,</b> then on both <b>this</b> day <b>and that</b> day it is <b>prohibited</b> for her to engage in intercourse. If she deviates a third time to see on the twentieth she has established for herself a new fixed menstrual cycle.
Abaye continues: <b>And you said to us with regard to this</b> mishna that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to a woman who normally experiences bleeding <b>fifteen</b> days <b>from her immersion, which are twenty-two</b> days <b>from her sighting</b> of menstrual blood. This means <b>that there, she stands in her days of menstruation. But</b> if she normally experiences bleeding <b>fifteen</b> days <b>from her sighting</b> of menstrual blood, so <b>that she stands in her days of <i>ziva</i>,</b> she <b>has not fixed</b> a menstrual cycle, and the previous cycle is uprooted even if she deviates from it only once.
§ With regard to the ruling that a woman’s menstrual cycle cannot be fixed during her days of <i>ziva</i>, <b>Rav Pappa said: I said</b> this <b><i>halakha</i> before Rav Yehuda of Diskarta,</b> and I asked him for a clarification of the following matter: Granted, <b>she does not fix</b> a menstrual cycle during the days of <i>ziva</i>, and there is no need for three deviations to uproot her cycle; rather, it is uprooted by even one deviation. But <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether <b>we should be concerned</b> that <b>she</b> might experience bleeding? In other words, if she normally experiences bleeding on a particular day during her days of <i>ziva</i>, must she avoid engaging in sexual intercourse with her husband on that day out of concern that she might emit blood?
Rav Yehuda of Diskarta <b>was silent and did not say anything to</b> Rav Pappa. Therefore, <b>Rav Pappa said: Let us see</b> and try to resolve this <b>ourselves.</b> The mishna cited above states: If the woman <b>was accustomed to see</b> an emission of blood <b>on the fifteenth day, and she deviated</b> from her cycle <b>to</b> see an emission on the <b>twentieth day,</b> then on both <b>this</b> day <b>and that</b> day it is <b>prohibited</b> for her to engage in sexual intercourse.

Daf 39b

<b>And</b> with regard to this mishna, <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to a woman who normally experiences bleeding <b>fifteen</b> days <b>from her immersion, which are twenty-two</b> days <b>from her sighting</b> of menstrual blood, which means that there, she stands in her days of menstruation.
<b>And</b> when the mishna states that <b>she deviated</b> from her cycle and experienced bleeding on the twentieth day, it means she experienced bleeding twenty days from her immersion, i.e., <b>twenty-seven days from</b> her previous sighting, not twenty-two. This means <b>that when twenty-two days again elapse</b> from when she usually experiences bleeding, <b>she stands within</b> what is now the eleven <b>days of her <i>ziva</i>. And</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that both <b>this,</b> the twenty-second day, <b>and that,</b> the twenty-seventh day, <b>are prohibited,</b> despite the fact that the twenty-second day now stands during her days of <i>ziva</i>. <b>Evidently, we are concerned</b> for an emission of blood during the days of <i>ziva</i> if she is accustomed to experiencing bleeding on that day.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>And Rav Pappa holds</b> that <b>we count twenty-two</b> days of her menstrual cycle <b>from twenty-two</b> days, i.e., from when she usually begins to menstruate, whereas <b>we count the beginning</b> of the days of <b>menstruation from</b> day <b>twenty-seven,</b> when she actually experiences bleeding. Consequently, the twenty-second day of her normal menstrual cycle falls during the days of <i>ziva</i>, according to the actual day of menstruation.
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said to Rav Pappa: From where</b> do you know this is the correct reckoning of her days? <b>Perhaps one also counts</b> those <b>twenty-two</b> days <b>from</b> day <b>twenty-seven,</b> such <b>that when twenty-two days again arrive</b> from day twenty-seven, <b>she stands within her days of menstruation.</b> Accordingly, there is no proof from the mishna with regard to a sighting during the days of <i>ziva</i>.
Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, adds: <b>And so too, it is reasonable</b> that the twenty-two days are counted from when she actually experiences bleeding. <b>As if you do not say so,</b> then consider the case of <b>this chicken that</b> normally <b>lays</b> an egg on one <b>day and withholds</b> an egg the next <b>day, and lays</b> an egg on the third <b>day and withholds</b> an egg on the fourth <b>day. And</b> the chicken deviated from its routine, so that after laying eggs on the first day and third day, it <b>withheld</b> an egg for <b>two days and</b> then <b>laid</b> an egg on <b>one day,</b> i.e., on the sixth day.
When this chicken <b>again takes hold</b> of its previous routine and starts laying an egg on one day and withholding an egg on the next, does <b>it take hold of</b> the order of the routine <b>ahead of it,</b> i.e., will it withhold an egg on the next day, <b>or</b> does <b>it take hold</b> of its routine <b>as it</b> was <b>from the outset,</b> so that it will lay an egg on the seventh day, as if there had been no deviation? <b>Perforce it takes hold of</b> the order of the routine <b>ahead of it.</b> Likewise, a woman who deviated from her normal menstrual cycle counts the days of her cycle according to the order of the cycle ahead of her, i.e., from the time that she experiences bleeding.
<b>Rav Pappa said to</b> Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: <b>But</b> if so, a question arises with regard to <b>that which Reish Lakish said: A woman fixes</b> a menstrual <b>cycle for herself during the days of her <i>ziva</i>, but a woman does not fix</b> a menstrual <b>cycle for herself during the days of her menstruation,</b> i.e., when she is already a menstruating woman. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: A woman fixes</b> a menstrual <b>cycle for herself during the days of her menstruation.</b> One could ask: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this dispute? Rabbi Yoḥanan cannot be referring to a case where all her sightings occurred while she was a menstruating woman, as everyone agrees that a woman’s menstrual cycle is not fixed in such a situation (see 11a).
Rather, <b>is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where she saw</b> blood on the <b>first of the month; and</b> then again on <b>the fifth of</b> that same <b>month,</b> when she was a menstruating woman; <b>and</b> subsequently she saw blood on the <b>first of the</b> next <b>month and</b> then again on <b>the fifth of</b> that <b>month; and now</b> in the third month she <b>saw</b> blood <b>on the fifth of the month but on the first of the month she did not see</b> blood? In such a situation, the woman experienced an emission of blood on the fifth of the month for three consecutive months.
Rav Pappa concludes: <b>And</b> it is with regard to this case that Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>says: A woman fixes</b> a menstrual <b>cycle for herself during the days of her menstruation.</b> Although she was not actually a menstruating woman before she experienced bleeding on the fifth day of the third month, this is nevertheless considered a sighting during her days of menstruation. <b>Evidently, one counts</b> her menstrual cycle <b>from the first of the month,</b> despite the fact that she did not actually experience bleeding. Likewise, with regard to the case involving twenty-two days, one counts from when she generally experiences bleeding, not from the day she emitted blood in practice.
Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, <b>said to</b> Rav Pappa: These are <b>not</b> the circumstances of the dispute. Rather, <b>this</b> is what <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The dispute is referring to a case <b>where she saw</b> blood on the <b>first of the month; and</b> then again on the <b>first of the</b> next <b>month, and</b> then again on <b>the twenty-fifth</b> day <b>of</b> that <b>month; and</b> again on the <b>first of the</b> next <b>month,</b> which occurs during her days of menstruation. Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that although she is in her days of menstruation, this sighting on the first of the third month serves to fix her menstrual cycle, <b>as we say</b> with regard to the sighting on the twenty-fifth day of the previous month that <b>it is extra blood that gathered inside her.</b> Therefore, it does not negate her regular cycle.
The Gemara notes: <b>And likewise, when Ravin and all</b> the <b>sea-farers came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia and transmitted statements of Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>they said</b> this statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua.</b><br/>.

Daf 40a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> After the birth of an offspring by <b>caesarean section,</b> the mother <b>does not observe</b> seven or fourteen <b>days of impurity and</b> thirty-three or sixty-six <b>days of purity for</b> male and female offspring, respectively, <b>and she is not obligated to</b> bring <b>for it</b> the <b>offering</b> brought by a woman after childbirth. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The halakhic status of <b>that</b> offspring is <b>like</b> that of an offspring <b>born</b> in a standard birth.
<b>All women become ritually impure</b> with the flow of blood from the uterus <b>into the outer chamber,</b> i.e., the vagina, although it did not leave the woman’s body, <b>as it is stated: “And her issue in her flesh shall be blood,</b> she shall be in her menstruation seven days” (Leviticus 15:19), indicating that even if her menstrual blood remains in her flesh, she becomes impure. <b>But one who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>] and one who experiences a seminal emission do not become ritually impure until their</b> emission of <b>impurity emerges outside</b> the body.
If a priest <b>was partaking of <i>teruma</i>,</b> the portion of the produce designated for the priest, <b>and sensed a quaking of his limbs</b> indicating that a seminal emission was imminent, he should firmly <b>hold</b> his <b>penis</b> to prevent the emission from leaving his body, <b>and swallow the <i>teruma</i></b> while ritually pure. <b>And</b> the emission of a <i>zav</i> and a seminal emission <b>impart impurity in any amount, even like</b> the size of <b>a mustard seed or</b> even <b>smaller than that.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna cites a dispute as to whether or not a birth by caesarean section is considered a birth with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to childbirth. <b>Rabbi Mani bar Patish said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> who say that it is not considered a birth? It is because <b>the verse states: “If a woman emitted seed and gave birth to a male,</b> then she shall be impure seven days…And when the days of her purification are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a pigeon or a dove for a sin offering” (Leviticus 12:2–6). It is derived from here that the <i>halakhot</i> mentioned in that passage do not apply <b>unless she gives birth through the place where she emits seed.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> interpret the term “emitted seed”? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> word serves to teach <b>that even</b> if <b>she gave birth only</b> to a fluid that <b>resembles the seed that she emitted,</b> i.e., the fetus died and entirely decomposed and dissolved before emerging, <b>its mother is ritually impure</b> due to <b>childbirth.</b>
The Gemara further asks: <b>And Rabbi Shimon, what is</b> the <b>reason</b> for <b>his</b> opinion that the <i>halakhot</i> of childbirth apply in the case of a caesarean section? <b>Reish Lakish said</b> that it is because the <b>verse states:</b> “But if <b>she gives birth</b> to a female” (Leviticus 12:5). The term “she gives birth” is superfluous in the context of the passage, as it was mentioned previously, and it therefore serves <b>to include</b> the birth of an offspring by <b>caesarean section.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what do <b>the Rabbis</b> derive from this superfluous expression? The Gemara answers: In their opinion, <b>that</b> expression <b>is necessary to include</b> the birth of a child <b>whose sexual organs are indeterminate [<i>tumtum</i>] or a hermaphrodite. As</b> it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that as the words <b>“male”</b> (Leviticus 12:2) <b>and “female”</b> (Leviticus 12:5) are <b>written</b> in the passage, these <i>halakhot</i> apply only to <b>a definite male</b> and <b>a definite female, but not</b> to <b>a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite.</b> Therefore, the term “she gives birth” <b>teaches us</b> that it is the birth itself, not the sex of the offspring, that matters.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> from where does <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> derive that these <i>halakhot</i> apply to a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> that <b>which bar Livai teaches, as bar Livai teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> that discusses the verse: “And when the days of her purity are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter” (Leviticus 12:6). Since the verse uses the terms “son” and “daughter,” rather than male and female, it is derived from the term <b>“for a son”</b> that these <i>halakhot</i> apply <b>to a son in any case,</b> even if his masculinity is not definite. Similarly, the term <b>“for a daughter”</b> teaches that these <i>halakhot</i> apply <b>to a daughter in any case,</b> even if her femininity is not definite.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what do <b>the Rabbis</b> derive from the terms “for a son” and “for a daughter”? The Gemara answers: In their opinion, <b>that</b> term <b>is necessary to obligate</b> the mother to bring an offering <b>for each and every son</b> to whom she gives birth, rather than one offering after having given birth to several sons; <b>and likewise to obligate</b> her to bring an offering <b>for each and every daughter</b> to whom she gives birth.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> from where does <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers that <b>he derives it from</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>that a <i>tanna</i> taught before Rav Sheshet:</b> The verse states: <b>“This is the law for one who gives birth,</b> whether to a male or a female” (Leviticus 12:7). This <b>teaches that</b> a woman <b>brings a single offering for many offspring</b> born within a short time, e.g., after a multiple birth. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>she may bring</b> an offering <b>for</b> her <b>childbirth and</b> an offering <b>for</b> an irregular <b>discharge</b> of blood from the uterus [<i>ziva</i>], in a case where she is required to bring one, <b>as one,</b> i.e., that she may fulfill her two obligations with a single offering.
The Gemara interrupts the <i>baraita</i> to raise a difficulty: <b>But</b> how could it possibly enter your mind that a woman may bring one offering for two obligations? In the case of <b>a woman after childbirth who consumed blood, or a woman after childbirth who ate</b> forbidden <b>fat,</b> is <b>one offering sufficient for her?</b> One who eats blood or forbidden fat is obligated to bring a sin offering for atonement (see Leviticus 7:25–27). There is no reason to think that a woman after childbirth, who is required to bring a sin offering for a reason other than her childbirth, may bring one offering for both obligations. Similarly, there are no grounds for suggesting that a single offering might suffice for both childbirth and <i>ziva</i>.
<b>Rather,</b> the statement of the <i>baraita</i> should be revised, as follows: One <b>might</b> have thought that a woman <b>may bring</b> an offering <b>for a childbirth that</b> occurred <b>before the completion</b> of her term of postpartum purity, <b>and for</b> a second <b>childbirth that</b> happened <b>after the completion</b> of that period, <b>as one,</b> i.e., she may fulfill her two obligations with a single offering. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “This</b> is the law for one who gives birth” (Leviticus 12:7), indicating that each birth, unless it occurred within the period of purity following another birth, requires its own offering. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> respond to this derivation? The Gemara answers that in their opinion, <b>even though it is written: “This</b> is the law,” <b>it was</b> still <b>necessary</b> for the verse to state: <b>“For a son, or for a daughter.”</b>
The Gemara explains: Had the Torah stated only the verse: “This is the law,” it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that one offering does not suffice for two births that occurred as a result <b>of two pregnancies,</b> as the second one was a miscarriage whose conception occurred during the woman’s period of purity following the first birth. <b>But</b> if both births occurred as a result <b>of one pregnancy, such as</b> in the case of <b>Yehuda and Ḥizkiyya,</b> the twin <b>sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> who were born three months apart (see 27a), <b>I would say that one offering</b> for both births is <b>sufficient for her.</b> Therefore, the verse “for a son, or for a daughter” <b>teaches us</b> otherwise.
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And Rabbi Shimon,</b> who maintains that childbirth by caesarean section has the halakhic status of regular childbirth, <b>concedes in</b> the case of <b>consecrated</b> animals <b>that</b> if one attempts to consecrate an animal born by caesarean section, it <b>is not consecrated. What is the reason</b> for this opinion? <b>He derives</b> it by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the word <b>birth</b> that is written with regard to consecrated animals (see Leviticus 22:27), and the word <b>birth</b> that is written in connection with a <b>firstborn</b> animal (see Deuteronomy 15:19). <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of the firstborn, the <i>halakhot</i> apply specifically to one who <b>“opens the womb”</b> (Exodus 13:15), <b>so too here,</b> in the case of consecrated animals, the <i>halakhot</i> apply only to one who <b>opens the womb.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>And let</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>derive</b> a different conclusion by a similar verbal analogy, as the word <b>birth</b> is written with regard to consecrated animals, and the word <b>birth</b> is also written <b>with regard to a person,</b> i.e., a woman who gives birth (see Leviticus 12:2): <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of humans, childbirth by <b>caesarean section</b> has the status of childbirth according to Rabbi Shimon, <b>so too here,</b> in the case of consecrated animals, an animal born by <b>caesarean section</b> is considered the same as an animal born via a natural birth.
The Gemara answers: It <b>is</b> more <b>reasonable for</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>to derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a consecrated animal <b>from a firstborn</b> animal, rather than from the <i>halakha</i> of childbirth, <b>as</b> it is written with regard to a consecrated animal: <b>“Its mother”</b> (Leviticus 22:27), and it is likewise written <b>with regard to</b> a firstborn animal: <b>“Its mother”</b> (Exodus 22:29). The Gemara objects: <b>On the contrary, he should derive</b> it <b>from human</b> births, <b>as</b> that would be a derivation of the <i>halakha</i> concerning consecrated animals that are <b>ordinary,</b> i.e., not firstborns, <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning human births of children that are <b>ordinary,</b> and not firstborns.
The Gemara adopts a different line of reasoning: <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>should derive</b> it <b>from a firstborn</b> animal, <b>as</b> they both share the following five characteristics: In both cases it is written: “its <b>mother”;</b> both are cases of <b>a sacrificial animal;</b> both are subject to <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> the disqualification of an offering through improper intent during its sacrificial rites; both are subject to <b><i>notar</i>,</b> the disqualification of sacrificial meat after a prescribed time; <b>and</b> finally, both are subject to disqualification by becoming <b>ritually impure.</b> By contrast, humans do not share any of these characteristics.
The Gemara objects: <b>On the contrary, he should derive</b> it <b>from human</b> births, <b>as</b> both cases share the following four characteristics: They are both instances of <b>ordinary,</b> non-firstborn offspring; they both apply to the offspring of either sex, and are not exclusively <b>males;</b> they are both dealing with offspring that are not automatically <b>sacred</b> at birth; and they both apply <b>to</b> offspring that are not <b>a gift</b> to a priest, but belong to an individual non-priest. By contrast, firstborn animals do not share any of these characteristics. The Gemara answers that the comparison to firstborn animals is preferable to the comparison to human childbirth because <b>these</b> shared characteristics <b>are more</b> numerous. The comparison to consecrated animals includes five shared characteristics, whereas the comparison to human births involves only four.
<b>Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rav Huna, said in the name of Rava:</b> A <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught which supports</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Rabbi Yehuda says: “This is the law of the burnt offering; that is the burnt offering</b> that goes up on the pyre upon the altar” (Leviticus 6:2). It is derived from this verse that the <i>halakha</i> is that if a part of a disqualified offering is taken up to the altar it should be burned there, rather than taken down, despite its unfit status. <b>There are three</b> expressions which indicate <b>exclusion</b> in this verse: The term “this is,” which indicates this one and not another one; the term “that is,” indicating that one and not another one; and the term “the burnt offering” instead of “a burnt offering.”

Daf 40b

These three expressions allude <b>to the exclusion of</b> the following three cases from the above principle: An offering that was disqualified because it was <b>slaughtered at night, and</b> an offering <b>whose blood spilled</b> before it could be sprinkled on the altar, <b>and</b> an offering <b>whose blood</b> was disqualified because it <b>was taken outside the curtains [<i>lakela’im</i>]</b> surrounding the courtyard of the Tabernacle in the wilderness, i.e., it left the Temple courtyard. These three cases are excluded, <b>as</b> in these instances, <b>if</b> parts of the disqualified offering <b>ascended,</b> i.e., were brought upon the altar, <b>they must descend,</b> i.e., be taken down.
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> From the verse’s reference to <b>a burnt offering, I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a valid burnt offering</b> should not be taken down from the altar. <b>From where</b> is it derived that the verse also serves <b>to include</b> the following disqualified offerings: An offering <b>that</b> is invalid because it <b>was slaughtered at night; and</b> one <b>whose blood spilled</b> before sprinkling; <b>and</b> one <b>whose blood was taken outside the curtains,</b> i.e., the Temple courtyard; <b>and</b> one whose blood <b>was left overnight; and</b> one <b>that was</b> itself <b>taken out</b> of the Temple courtyard; <b>and</b> one <b>that</b> became <b>ritually impure; and</b> one <b>that was left overnight; and</b> one <b>that was slaughtered</b> with the intent to eat its flesh <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time or outside its</b> designated <b>area.</b>
<b>And</b> likewise, from where is it derived that the verse serves to include offerings <b>that</b> those who are <b>unfit</b> for performing the Temple service <b>collected or sprinkled their blood; and</b> offerings <b>whose</b> blood is supposed to be <b>placed above</b> the red line of the altar but <b>which one placed below</b> that line; <b>and</b> offerings <b>whose</b> blood is supposed to be <b>placed below</b> the red line of the altar but <b>which one placed above</b> it; <b>and</b> offerings <b>whose</b> blood should be <b>placed</b> on the altar situated <b>outside</b> the Sanctuary but <b>which one</b> instead <b>placed</b> on the altar <b>inside</b> the Sanctuary; <b>and</b> offerings <b>whose</b> blood should be <b>placed</b> on the altar <b>inside</b> the Sanctuary but <b>which one placed</b> on the altar <b>outside; and a Paschal offering and a sin offering that one slaughtered not for their</b> own <b>sake,</b> i.e., while slaughtering he actually intended to sacrifice a different offering? <b>From where</b> is it derived that although these offerings are disqualified, if they were brought up to the altar they are not taken down?
<b>The verse states: “This is the law of the burnt offering.”</b> The verse thereby <b>included</b> in <b>one law all</b> items <b>that ascend</b> upon the altar, even disqualified offerings, teaching <b>that if they ascended</b> the altar, <b>they shall not descend.</b>
Rabbi Shimon continues: One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> should also <b>include an animal that copulated with a person; and an animal that was the object of bestiality; and</b> an animal <b>that</b> was <b>set aside</b> for idol worship; <b>and</b> an animal <b>that was worshipped</b> as a deity; <b>and</b> an animal that was given as <b>payment</b> to a prostitute <b>or</b> as <b>the price</b> of a dog; <b>and</b> an animal that is an offspring of <b>diverse kinds,</b> i.e., crossbreeding; <b>and an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>]; and</b> an animal born by <b>caesarean section.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “This,”</b> to exclude these disqualifications.
Rabbi Shimon elaborates: <b>And what did you see,</b> i.e., what is the reason <b>to include these</b> particular cases <b>and to exclude those</b> particular cases?

Daf 41a

Rabbi Shimon explains: <b>After the verse</b> both <b>included</b> some disqualified offerings in this principle <b>and excluded</b> others, <b>you should say: I include</b> in the items that should not be taken down if they had been placed on the altar <b>those whose disqualification</b> occurred <b>in the sacred</b> area, i.e., the Temple courtyard, in the course of the sacrificial service, e.g., an offering that was slaughtered at night, or whose blood spilled before sprinkling. <b>And I exclude those whose disqualification was not in the sacred</b> area, such as an animal that copulated with a person, as these animals were disqualified before their sacrificial process began. This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara explains how this <i>baraita</i> supports the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan. The <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches, in any event, that</b> an animal <b>born by caesarean section</b> is <b>not</b> fit for sacrifice. <b>What, is it not</b> referring to one who consecrates an animal born by <b>caesarean section</b> and renders it <b>a sacrificial</b> animal? Evidently, although Rabbi Shimon maintains that a human birth by caesarean section has the halakhic status of a regular birth, he concedes that animals born in this manner are unfit for sacrifice. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan, said: No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is dealing <b>with a firstborn</b> animal born by <b>caesarean section,</b> and it is this animal that is disqualified as an offering. A firstborn animal is sacred only if it emerged from the womb.
The Gemara objects to this interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>: How can it be referring to <b>a firstborn</b> animal? The <i>halakha</i> that firstborn status does not apply to an animal born by caesarean section is <b>derived from</b> the phrase <b>“opens the womb,”</b> which teaches that only animals born in the natural manner are endowed with the sanctity of firstborn animals and may be sacrificed on the altar. Since an animal born by caesarean section is not sacred at all, and it is clear that a non-sacred animal cannot be sacrificed upon the altar, it is obvious that the animal must be taken down if it was placed there in error.
The Gemara responds to this objection: <b>Rather, what</b> would you say? Would you say that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to an ordinary animal, not a firstborn, <b>that</b> had been consecrated as <b>a sacrificial</b> animal? But this animal is not sacred either, as <b>derived from</b> the verbal analogy of the term <b>“its mother”</b> stated with regard to the firstborn and the term <b>“its mother”</b> stated in connection with consecrated animals, as Rabbi Yoḥanan taught earlier. If one seeks to consecrate as an offering an animal that was born by caesarean section, it is not rendered sacred at all. Accordingly, the same reasoning applies as before: It is evident that a non-sacred animal may not be placed on the altar, and it must be removed if placed there in error.
The Gemara rejects this response: <b>What is this</b> comparison between firstborn animals and consecrated animals? <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to animals <b>that are consecrated</b> to be offerings, <b>that is why two verses are necessary: One</b> verse, the verbal analogy between consecrated animals and firstborn animals, teaches <b>that a non-sacred animal</b> whose mother <b>gave birth</b> to it <b>by caesarean section and</b> whose owner subsequently <b>consecrated it</b> as an offering is not sacred at all, and must therefore be removed from the altar if it was placed there in error.
<b>And one</b> verse: “This is the law of the burnt offering; that is the burnt offering that goes up on the pyre upon the altar” (Leviticus 6:2), teaches <b>with regard to a sacrificial animal that gave birth by caesarean section,</b> that although the offspring is sacred by virtue of its mother’s sanctity, it may not be sacrificed and must be removed from the altar if placed there in error. <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i> <b>maintains</b> that the <b>offspring of sacrificial animals are</b> automatically <b>sacred upon their emergence</b> from the womb. <b>But if you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a firstborn</b> animal that was born by caesarean section, the <i>halakha</i> that this animal is not sacred <b>is derived from</b> the phrase <b>“opens the womb.”</b>
The Gemara adds: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to interpret the <i>baraita</i> in this manner, that it is referring to an offspring born to a sacrificial animal by caesarean section, <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that <b>an animal that copulated with a person, and an animal that was the object of bestiality, and</b> an animal <b>that</b> was <b>set aside</b> for idol worship, <b>and</b> an animal <b>that was worshipped</b> as a deity, <b>and</b> an animal that is an offspring of <b>diverse kinds,</b> must all be removed from the altar if placed there in error.
The Gemara explains: Now <b>are these</b> disqualifications <b>derived from here,</b> from the verse adduced by the <i>baraita</i>? No, they are <b>derived from elsewhere,</b> as taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “You shall bring your offering from the cattle, even from the herd or from the flock” (Leviticus 1:2). The expression <b>“from the cattle”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> from eligibility as an offering <b>an animal that copulated with a person and an animal that was the object of bestiality.</b> The expression <b>“from the herd”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> an animal <b>that was worshipped</b> as a deity. <b>“From the flock”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> an animal <b>set aside</b> for idol worship. The word “or” in the expression <b>“or from the flock”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> an animal <b>that gored</b> a person, killing him. In all these cases the animal cannot be consecrated at all, and therefore it is not necessary for the Torah to teach that they must be removed from the altar if placed there in error.
<b>And furthermore,</b> is the disqualification of an animal born of a mixture of <b>diverse kinds derived from here?</b> No, it is <b>derived from elsewhere,</b> as taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “When <b>a bull or a sheep or a goat</b> is born, it shall be seven days under its mother; but from the eighth day and onward it may be accepted for an offering” (Leviticus 22:27). The term <b>“a bull”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> an offspring of <b>diverse kinds</b> from being used as an offering, The phrase <b>“or a goat”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> an animal that <b>resembles</b> another, i.e., a sheep that is the offspring of sheep but that looks like a goat, or vice versa. Once again, as these animals cannot be consecrated at all, it is not necessary for the Torah to teach that they must be removed from the altar if placed there in error.
<b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>two verses are necessary</b> for each of these cases: <b>One to</b> teach that <b>a non-sacred animal</b> that is subject to any of these disqualifications cannot be consecrated, <b>and</b> the other <b>one to</b> teach that with regard to <b>a sacrificial animal</b> that was born with this status by virtue of its mother’s sanctity, if it is subject to one of these disqualifications it may not be sacrificed and must be removed from the altar if placed there in error. Accordingly, it stands to reason that <b>here too,</b> in the case of an animal born by caesarean section, <b>two verses</b> are <b>necessary</b> for the same reason: One for a non-sacred animal, to teach that it cannot be consecrated, and another for the offspring of a sacrificial animal.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Although a woman who experiences a discharge of uterine blood after her menstrual period is rendered a <i>zava</i> and must count seven clean days before immersing and purifying herself, if a pregnant woman <b>experiences</b> birth <b>pangs</b> accompanied by bleeding for <b>three days</b> after her menstrual period, at the end of which she gives birth, she is not rendered a <i>zava</i>, as the bleeding is attributed to the childbirth. <b>And</b> if the <b>offspring emerged by caesarean section, she is</b> considered <b>one who has given birth during</b> a period of <b><i>ziva</i>. But Rabbi Shimon says: She is not</b> considered <b>one who has given birth during</b> a period of <b><i>ziva</i>. And</b> the <b>blood that emerges from there is ritually impure, but Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>pure.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Granted, the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> is clear: <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning,</b> cited in the mishna, that birth via caesarean section has the halakhic status of childbirth; <b>and the Rabbis,</b> i.e., the first <i>tanna</i>, conform <b>to their</b> line of <b>reasoning,</b> that birth via caesarean section does not have the halakhic status of childbirth. <b>But</b> in <b>the latter clause, with regard to what</b> matter <b>do they disagree? Ravina said:</b> The latter clause is referring to a case <b>where the offspring emerged by caesarean section,</b>

Daf 41b

<b>and blood</b> emerged <b>through the womb,</b> i.e., vaginally, during the three days preceding the birth. <b>And Rabbi Shimon</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning,</b> that a caesarean birth is a full-fledged birth, and therefore the blood that emerged prior to the birth is ritually pure, <b>and the Rabbis</b> conform <b>to their</b> line of <b>reasoning,</b> that a caesarean birth is not halakhically considered a birth, which means that the blood which emerged beforehand is considered the blood of <i>ziva</i>, and is ritually impure.
<b>Rav Yosef objects to this</b> explanation: <b>One</b> difficulty is that according to this interpretation, the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i> is superfluous, <b>as</b> the dispute recorded there <b>is</b> identical to that of <b>the first clause. And furthermore,</b> the words: <b>From there,</b> in the phrase: The blood that emerges from there, <b>indicate</b> that this is referring to a place already mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>, i.e., the <b>place</b> from which the <b>offspring</b> emerged, which is the abdominal incision of the caesarean section, not the vagina.
<b>Rather, Rav Yosef said</b> that this is the explanation of the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i>: It is referring to a situation <b>where</b> both the <b>offspring and blood emerged through</b> the incision in the <b>abdomen.</b> It is in such a case that the first <i>tanna</i> deems the blood which emerged impure and Rabbi Shimon deems it pure.
<b>And</b> the matter <b>with regard to</b> which they <b>disagree</b> is whether or not <b>the location</b> of a woman’s <b>source,</b> i.e., her uterus, is ritually <b>impure.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that <b>the location</b> of a woman’s <b>source</b> is ritually <b>impure,</b> and therefore any blood that emerges from it, regardless of how it came out of her body, is impure as well. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds</b> that <b>the location</b> of a woman’s <b>source</b> is <b>pure,</b> and blood that emerges from there is also pure. Only uterine blood which emerges vaginally is impure.
§ <b>Reish Lakish says: According to the statement of the one who deems the blood impure,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>he deems the woman impure</b> as well, as though it were blood of menstruation. Likewise, <b>according to the statement of the one who deems the blood pure,</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>he deems the woman pure</b> as well. <b>But Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Even according to the statement of the one who deems the blood impure,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>he deems the woman pure.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan follows his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning</b> here, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a woman does not become impure</b> due to menstruation <b>unless the flow</b> of blood <b>emerges from her nakedness,</b> i.e., genitalia? <b>As it is stated: “And a man who lies with a woman having her flow, and shall uncover her nakedness, he has made naked her source”</b> (Leviticus 20:18) This <b>teaches that a woman is not impure</b> due to menstruation <b>unless</b> the <b>flow emerges from her nakedness.</b>
<b>Reish Lakish says in the name of Rabbi Yehuda Nesia:</b> If a woman’s <b>source,</b> i.e., her uterus, <b>became dislodged and fell</b> out of her body <b>onto the ground, she is ritually impure, as it is stated: “Because your foundation was poured out, and your nakedness was uncovered”</b> (Ezekiel 16:36). The word “foundation” alludes to the uterus, and the verse is referring to it after it has been “poured out,” i.e., detached, as an uncovering of nakedness, which indicates that it is still a source of impurity even after it has been detached from its place.
The Gemara asks: <b>To what</b> kind of impurity is this woman subject in this situation? <b>If we say</b> that she is subject <b>to the impurity of seven</b> days of menstruating women, that is impossible, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah that such impurity is caused by <b>“blood”</b> (Leviticus 15:19), <b>and not a piece</b> of flesh. <b>Rather,</b> she is subject <b>to impurity</b> that lasts until the <b>evening,</b> as a result of the surface of her body having come into contact with the uterus, which is a source of impurity.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the case of a woman’s <b>source that discharged two</b> whitish, clear, <b>pearl-like [<i>margaliyyot</i>] drops, she is impure.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>To what</b> kind of impurity is this woman subject in this situation? <b>If we say</b> that she is subject <b>to the impurity of seven</b> days of menstruating women, that is impossible, as the mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 19a) states that there are <b>five</b> distinct colors of <b>ritually impure blood in a woman, but no more,</b> and pearly white is not one of those colors. <b>Rather,</b> she is subject <b>to impurity</b> that lasts until the <b>evening,</b> as a result of her body having come into contact with a discharge from the uterus, which is a source of impurity. <b>And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>specifically</b> if there were <b>two</b> drops, <b>but</b> if there was only <b>one</b> such drop she is not impure, as <b>I can say</b> that the drop <b>came from elsewhere,</b> not from the uterus.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>All women become ritually impure</b> with the flow of blood from the uterus <b>into the outer chamber,</b> i.e., the vagina, as it is stated: “And her issue in her flesh shall be blood” (Leviticus 15:19). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> exactly <b>is the outer chamber? Reish Lakish says: Any</b> place <b>which can be seen when a little girl sits</b> with her legs spread. When the blood reaches that area in the vagina, the woman becomes ritually impure.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to</b> Reish Lakish in objection: <b>That place is</b> considered <b>exposed</b> even <b>with regard to</b> contact with the carcass of a <b>creeping animal.</b> If one comes into contact with the carcass of a creeping animal he becomes impure. This is the <i>halakha</i> only if the animal touches a part of the body that is exposed, not an internal cavity such as the inside of the mouth. Since the area of the vagina described by Reish Lakish is considered an exposed part of the body for the purposes of the impurity imparted by the carcass of a creeping animal, it should not be necessary for the mishna to derive the <i>halakha</i> of her impurity from the expression “in her flesh.” <b>Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The term outer chamber extends <b>until</b> the area <b>between the teeth-</b>like projections inside the vagina.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Is the area <b>between the teeth-</b>like projections itself considered <b>as internal,</b> which would mean that blood there would not render the woman impure, <b>or as external? Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution, <b>as Rabbi Zakkai teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i>: The term outer chamber extends <b>to</b> the area <b>between the teeth-</b>like projections, but the area <b>between the teeth-</b>like projections <b>themselves</b> is considered <b>as internal.</b>
<b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i></b> that a woman becomes impure when the blood reaches the <b>place of threshing,</b> which is a euphemism. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of this euphemism, the <b>place of threshing? Rav Yehuda says:</b> It is referring to the <b>place</b> in the vagina <b>where the penis threshes,</b> i.e., reaches, during intercourse.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written concerning a menstruating woman: “And if a woman has an issue, and her flow in her flesh shall be blood, she shall be in her menstruation seven days” (Leviticus 15:19). The term <b>“in her flesh” teaches that she becomes impure</b> while the blood is still <b>inside</b> her flesh just <b>as</b> when the blood emerges <b>outside</b> her body. <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this applies in the case of <b>a menstruating woman. From where</b> is it derived that it applies to <b>a <i>zava</i></b> as well? <b>The</b> same <b>verse states: “Her flow [<i>zovah</i>] in her flesh.”</b>
<b>From where</b> is it derived that this also applies to a woman who <b>discharges semen</b> after intercourse? <b>The</b> same <b>verse states</b> the apparently superfluous term <b>“shall be.” And Rabbi Shimon says:</b> In the case of discharging semen, <b>it is sufficient for her</b> to be <b>like the man who engaged in intercourse with her: Just as the man who engaged in intercourse with her does not become impure until</b> the source of <b>impurity,</b> the semen, <b>emerges outside</b> his body, <b>so too, she does not become impure until her</b> source of <b>impurity,</b> the semen, <b>emerges outside</b> her body. It does not render her impure while it is still inside her body.
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Shimon</b> in fact <b>hold</b> that <b>it is sufficient for her</b> to be <b>like the man who engaged in intercourse with her? But isn’t it taught</b> to the contrary in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “The woman also with whom a man shall lie carnally, <b>they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be impure until the evening”</b> (Leviticus 15:18). <b>Rabbi Shimon said: And what does this</b> verse <b>come to teach us? If</b> it teaches <b>with regard to</b> one who <b>comes into contact with semen</b> that they are impure, <b>it is already stated below</b> (Leviticus 22:4): <b>“Or a man</b> from whom the flow of seed goes out,” from which it is derived that coming into contact with semen renders one impure.
<b>Rather,</b> this verse is necessary <b>because</b> in the case of intercourse the contact with the source of <b>impurity</b> occurs in <b>a concealed part</b> of the body, <b>and</b> contact with <b>impurity</b> by <b>a concealed part</b> of the body generally <b>does not render</b> one <b>impure. But</b> here <b>it is a Torah edict</b> that the woman does become impure in this manner. This <i>baraita</i> proves that according to Rabbi Shimon a woman is rendered impure by semen even when it is inside her body.
The Gemara answers that this is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> this second <i>baraita</i> is dealing <b>with</b> a woman who <b>engages in intercourse,</b> whereas <b>there,</b> the first <i>baraita</i> is dealing <b>with</b> a woman who <b>discharges</b> semen after intercourse. It is only during the act of intercourse that a woman becomes impure due to the semen. If she later discharges semen, she does not become impure, according to Rabbi Shimon, until the semen leaves her body and touches her on the outside.
The Gemara objects: But in the case of a woman who <b>discharges</b> semen, one can <b>derive</b> that she is impure <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that she engaged in intercourse</b> prior to the discharge. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Shimon is referring to a case <b>where she immersed herself,</b> thereby purifying herself <b>from</b> the impurity <b>from her intercourse,</b> and she subsequently discharged semen.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> in the case of a woman who <b>engages in intercourse it is sufficient for her</b> to simply immerse herself, and then she is <b>in</b> a state of <b>impurity</b> only until <b>evening? But didn’t Rava say:</b> A woman who <b>engages in intercourse is prohibited from partaking of <i>teruma</i>,</b> even if she is married to a priest, for <b>the entire three days</b> following the intercourse, <b>as it is impossible for her not to discharge</b> semen throughout this period, and <i>teruma</i> may not be consumed by one who is impure?
The Gemara answers: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> others <b>immersed</b> the woman while she was still <b>in bed,</b> and she remained there. If she remains lying down, it is possible for her not to discharge semen following intercourse, and the immersion after intercourse purifies her. The Gemara asks: <b>By inference,</b> one can conclude <b>that when Rava said</b> that a woman is in a constant state of impurity for three days after intercourse, he was referring to a case <b>where she walked</b> to the ritual bath <b>by foot and immersed</b> herself. But if so, <b>perhaps while she was walking she released</b> all the semen in her body even before the three days were over, and therefore will not subsequently become impure.

Daf 42a

<b>And if you would say</b> that it is certainly possible that she released all the semen, but Rava’s concern was that <b>perhaps</b> some of it might have <b>remained, if so, he should have</b> said: <b>We are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> some semen <b>remained</b> and will be discharged, rather than: It is impossible for her not to discharge semen throughout this period.
<b>Rather, according to Rava too,</b> this is referring even to a case <b>where</b> others <b>immersed her</b> while she was still <b>in bed</b> and she remained there for three days. <b>And</b> the contradiction is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> in the statement of Rava, he is referring to a woman <b>who turns around</b> in bed from side to side. It is therefore certain that she will discharge semen over the course of three days. <b>There,</b> in the statement of Rabbi Shimon, he is speaking of a woman lying in bed <b>who does not turn around</b> from side to side. Such a woman will not discharge semen at all.
<b>And</b> the statement of <b>Rava is referring to a verse</b> in the Torah, <b>and this</b> is what <b>he is saying: When the Merciful One writes</b> in the Torah, with regard to a man and woman who engaged in intercourse: <b>“They shall both bathe themselves in water, and be impure until the evening”</b> (Leviticus 15:18), which indicates that when evening comes the woman’s purification is complete, it is dealing with a case <b>where she</b> is in bed and <b>does not turn around</b> from side to side. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where she does turn around, she is prohibited from partaking of <i>teruma</i></b> for <b>the entire three days</b> following the intercourse, <b>as it is impossible for her not to discharge</b> semen throughout this period.
<b>Rav Shmuel bar Bisna asked Abaye:</b> With regard to a woman who <b>discharges semen, is her</b> status that of <b>one who experienced</b> an emission of an impure substance, <b>or is her</b> status that of <b>one who came into contact</b> with an impure substance?
The practical <b>difference</b> between these two possibilities is threefold: Whether or not the discharge <b>negates</b> her counting of seven clean days at the end of the <i>ziva</i> period, whether or not it <b>renders</b> her <b>impure by any amount, and</b> whether or not it <b>renders</b> her <b>impure</b> while still <b>inside</b> her body <b>as</b> it would after emerging <b>out</b> of her body. If it is considered an emission of an impure substance, it negates her count of seven clean days, and it renders her impure even in the slightest amount, and it renders her impure even before it emerges from her body. If it renders her impure because she came into contact with it, it does not negate her count, it renders her impure only if a certain minimum amount emerges, and it renders her impure only after touching the outside of her body.
Before addressing the dilemma, the Gemara raises a difficulty with Rav Shmuel bar Bisna’s question itself: <b>Whichever</b> way <b>you</b> look at it, the question is problematic. <b>If he had heard the <i>baraita</i></b> cited above, the answer is obvious: <b>According to the Rabbis, her status is</b> that of one who <b>experienced</b> an emission of an impure substance, as the <i>baraita</i> clearly states that in the Rabbis’ opinion the woman is rendered impure even before the semen emerges from her body. <b>And according to Rabbi Shimon, her status is</b> that of one who <b>came into contact with</b> the impure substance, as Rabbi Shimon states that the woman is impure only when the semen emerges from her body.
<b>And if</b> Rav Shmuel bar Bisna <b>did not hear the <i>baraita</i></b> and was unaware of it, it <b>is</b> certainly more <b>reasonable</b> to assume that <b>her</b> status should be that of one who <b>came into contact</b> with the semen. Why would he think otherwise, as after all, the emitted substance did not originate in her body?
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> Rav Shmuel bar Bisna <b>had heard the <i>baraita</i>, and he did not raise the dilemma according to</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis.</b> According to their opinion it is clear that the woman has the status of one who experienced an emission of an impure bodily substance. Rather, <b>when he raises the dilemma,</b> it is <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon.</b>
<b>And he does not raise the dilemma with regard to</b> the question of whether or not the semen <b>renders</b> her <b>impure</b> when it is <b>inside</b> the body <b>as</b> it would after emerging <b>outside</b> the body, as Rabbi Shimon states explicitly that the woman is impure only when the semen leaves her body. Rather, <b>when he raises the dilemma,</b> it is only with regard to the other two issues mentioned above: Whether or not the discharge <b>negates</b> her counting of seven clean days at the end of the <i>ziva</i> period, <b>and</b> whether or not it <b>renders</b> her <b>impure in any amount.</b> He therefore asked: <b>What</b> is the status of her discharge of semen with respect to these two matters?
The Gemara explains the sides of the dilemma: It is possible that <b>when Rabbi Shimon says: It is sufficient for her</b> to be <b>like the man who engaged in intercourse with her, this statement</b> applies only with regard to the question of whether or not the semen <b>renders</b> her <b>impure</b> when it is <b>inside</b> the body <b>as</b> it would after emerging <b>outside</b> the body. It does not render her impure unless it touches her body on the outside. <b>But</b> with regard to the question of whether or not the discharge <b>negates</b> her counting of seven clean days at the end of the <i>ziva</i> period <b>and</b> whether or not it <b>renders</b> her <b>impure in any amount,</b> perhaps <b>she is</b> considered impure as one who <b>experienced</b> an emission of an impure substance. <b>Or perhaps</b> there <b>is no difference.</b> Rather, with regard to all three issues she has the status of one who came into contact with an impure substance.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different explanation of Rav Shmuel bar Bisna’s dilemma: <b>Actually, he did not hear the <i>baraita</i></b> and was unaware of it. <b>And</b> as for the question of why he would think that the woman should have the status of one who experienced an emission of an impure bodily substance, <b>this was his dilemma: Since the Merciful One was stringent</b> before the giving of the Torah <b>on</b> Mount <b>Sinai with regard to</b> men <b>who had experienced a seminal emission,</b> in that they were prohibited from attending that event, as it is stated: “Be ready on the third day; do not come near a woman” (Exodus 19:15), whereas those who had come into contact with other impure items were not prohibited from attending, perhaps the stringency of this particular source of impurity should likewise be applied to a woman who discharges semen. If so, <b>her</b> status should be like one who <b>experienced</b> a seminal emission, rather than one who merely came into contact with semen.
The Gemara explains the other side of the dilemma: <b>Or perhaps we should not derive</b> any <i>halakhot</i> <b>from</b> the instructions given before the revelation at <b>Sinai, as that</b> was <b>a novelty.</b> The Gemara cites a proof for this claim: <b>As</b> that was the case with regard to <b><i>zavin</i> and lepers, whose</b> impurity is even more <b>stringent</b> than that of one who experiences a seminal emission, <b>but</b> nevertheless <b>the Merciful One was not stringent with regard to them,</b> as He permitted them to attend the ceremony of the giving of the Torah.
After clarifying Rav Shmuel bar Bisna’s dilemma, the Gemara cites Abaye’s answer to him. Abaye <b>said to him:</b> The woman’s status <b>is</b> that of one who <b>experienced</b> an emission of semen. Rav Shmuel bar Bisna <b>came</b> and <b>asked Rava</b> the same question, and <b>he</b> too <b>said to him:</b> The woman’s status <b>is</b> that of one who <b>experienced</b> an emission. <b>He came before Rav Yosef,</b> and <b>he</b> too <b>said to him: Her</b> status <b>is</b> that of one who <b>experienced</b> an emission. Rav Shmuel bar Bisna <b>came back to Abaye</b> and <b>said to him: You are all spewing the same saliva.</b> None of you are teaching anything new, as you all repeat the same unsatisfactory answer.
Abaye <b>said to him: I said well to you,</b> i.e., my response was correct. <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that <b>it is sufficient for</b> the woman to be <b>like the man who engaged in intercourse with her only with regard to</b> the question of whether or not the semen <b>renders</b> her <b>impure</b> while still <b>inside</b> her body <b>as</b> it would after emerging <b>out</b> of her body. Rabbi Shimon rules that it does not render her impure until it touches her on the outside. <b>But with regard to</b> the other two issues, i.e., <b>negating</b> the woman’s count of seven clean days at the end of a <i>ziva</i> period <b>and rendering</b> her <b>impure in any amount,</b> Rabbi Shimon maintains that the woman’s status <b>is</b> that of one who <b>experienced</b> an emission. Therefore, the discharge negates her count and renders her impure by any amount.
§ The Gemara continues to discuss types of ritual impurity that apply whether the impure substance is still inside the body or has been discharged from it. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a menstruating woman, a <i>zava</i>,</b> a woman <b>who observes</b> a clean <b>day for a day</b> she experiences a discharge, <b>and a woman after childbirth, they all become impure</b> while the blood is still <b>inside</b> their bodies just <b>as</b> they would be when the blood emerges <b>outside</b> their bodies.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> with regard to <b>all those</b> other cases, <b>it is well,</b> i.e., one can understand this ruling with regard to blood that has not left the body. <b>But</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a woman after childbirth</b> is puzzling, since <b>if</b> this is referring to blood that she discharges <b>in</b> her <b>days of menstruation,</b> then she is <b>a menstruating woman,</b> and she is included in the earlier category. Likewise, <b>if</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to blood that she discharges <b>in</b> her <b>days of <i>ziva</i>,</b> she has the status of <b><i>ziva</i>,</b> and once again is included in a previously mentioned category.
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the mention of a woman after childbirth is <b>necessary</b> only in a case <b>where</b> the days of ritual impurity after childbirth, which are seven for a male and fourteen for a female, have passed, and the woman <b>descended to immerse</b> in a ritual bath in order to emerge <b>from</b> her status of <b>impurity to purity.</b>
<b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> here is <b>like that which Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ashi said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> In the case of <b>a woman after childbirth who descended to immerse</b> in a ritual bath in order to emerge <b>from</b> her status of <b>impurity to purity, and blood was uprooted from her</b> uterus but it did not leave her body, her status is as follows: If this occurred <b>on</b> her <b>descent</b> to the ritual bath, she remains <b>impure,</b> as the immersion is ineffective. If it happened <b>on</b> her <b>ascent</b> from the bath, she is <b>pure,</b> as her period of purity, which is thirty-three days for a male and sixty-six for a female, has commenced.
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Zeira,</b> with regard to this <i>halakha</i>: If the blood emerged <b>on</b> her <b>descent</b> to immerse, <b>why</b> is she <b>impure?</b> After all, the blood <b>is</b> a substance of <b>impurity</b> that is <b>encapsulated</b> inside a body, and there is a <i>halakha</i> that an encapsulated source of impurity does not impart impurity to other items (see <i>Ḥullin</i> 71a). Rabbi Zeira <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>Go</b> and <b>ask Rabbi Avin, as I explained to him</b> the reason for this <i>halakha</i>, <b>and he nodded [<i>vekharkish</i>] his head to me</b> in <b>the study hall,</b> in affirmation of my explanation.
The Gemara relates that Rabbi Yirmeya indeed <b>went</b> and <b>asked</b> Rabbi Avin the reason, and Rabbi Avin <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: The Sages <b>rendered</b> this blood <b>like the unslaughtered carcass of a kosher bird, which imparts impurity</b> even <b>to</b> the <b>garments</b> of the one who eats it, when there is an olive-bulk of it <b>in</b> his <b>throat,</b> despite the fact that this source of impurity is encapsulated in his body. Rabbi Yirmeya asked Rabbi Avin: <b>Are</b> these cases <b>comparable?</b> How can one compare the impurity of a woman after childbirth to the impurity of one who eats the unslaughtered carcass of a kosher bird?

Daf 42b

Rabbi Yirmeya elaborates: <b>There,</b> with regard to the impurity contracted by swallowing an unslaughtered bird carcass, this unusual type of impurity <b>does not have</b> an equivalent form of <b>impurity outside,</b> since if one merely touches an unslaughtered bird carcass, he and his garments remain pure. By contrast, <b>here,</b> with regard to the blood of a woman after childbirth, <b>let it become impure</b> only <b>when it emerges outside</b> her body, like all other items that impart impurity by contact once they are no longer encapsulated. Rather, due to this difficulty one must explain that <b>here too,</b> Rabbi Zeira is referring to a case <b>where</b> the blood <b>emerged outside</b> her body after her immersion; otherwise she remains pure.
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the reason that the woman is pure is that the blood <b>emerged outside</b> her body, <b>what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this <i>halakha</i>? Certainly, this blood renders the woman impure upon contact. The Gemara answers that this ruling is necessary, <b>lest you say: Since</b> the woman’s <b>immersion is effective for</b> any <b>blood that is inside</b> her, i.e., it prevents that blood from rendering her impure, <b>let it also be effective for this</b> blood, which did not leave her body until after the immersion. Therefore, Rabbi Zeira <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the <i>halakha</i>.
The Gemara objects: <b>We have resolved our <i>halakha</i>,</b> the statement of Rabbi Zeira, <b>but</b> the difficulty remains with regard to the case of <b>a woman after childbirth.</b> In light of the explanation of Rabbi Zeira’s opinion, the <i>baraita</i> cited at the beginning of the discussion, which states that a woman after childbirth becomes impure by blood that is still inside her body, cannot be interpreted in accordance with his opinion, as Rabbi Zeira maintains that the blood does not render her impure unless it emerges outside her body. Accordingly, the original difficulty remains: <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to blood that she discharges <b>in</b> her <b>days of menstruation,</b> then she is <b>a menstruating woman,</b> and <b>if</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to her <b>days of <i>ziva</i>,</b> it has the status of <b><i>ziva</i>,</b> both are which are already listed in the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara explains: <b>Here we are dealing with a dry birth,</b> without the emission of blood, and the <i>baraita</i> is teaching that the woman is rendered impure despite the fact that no blood emerged. The Gemara asks: If the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>a dry birth, what</b> blood <b>is there</b> that <b>becomes impure</b> while still <b>inside</b> the woman’s body just <b>as</b> it would when emerging <b>outside</b> her body? There is no blood at all in the case of a dry birth.
The Gemara answers that this clause is not referring to blood; rather, this is a situation <b>where</b> the <b>offspring put his head out of the corridor,</b> in which case it is considered born and renders its mother impure, despite the fact that the rest of its body has not emerged. <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Oshaya, as Rav Oshaya said:</b> If a midwife inserted her hand into the womb of a woman whose fetus is dead, she is rendered impure due to contact with a corpse. This is a rabbinic <b>decree lest</b> the midwife touch it after <b>the offspring puts his head out of the corridor</b> and it dies afterward, in which case the fetus is considered born and therefore she would be ritually impure by Torah law.
The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> this is <b>similar to</b> an incident involving <b>a certain</b> man <b>who came before Rava</b> and <b>said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> whether one <b>may circumcise on Shabbat?</b> Rava <b>said to him:</b> One may <b>well</b> do so. <b>After</b> that man <b>left, Rava said</b> to himself, perplexed: Can it <b>enter your mind that that man did not know that</b> it is <b>permitted to circumcise on Shabbat,</b> and he approached me to inquire about such a basic matter? There must be an unstated aspect to his question. Rava therefore <b>went after him</b> and <b>said to him: Say to me, my friend [<i>izi</i>], how did the incident itself happen?</b>
The man <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>I heard</b> the <b>child making a noise at nightfall on Shabbat eve,</b> before Shabbat began, <b>but it was not born until Shabbat.</b> Rava <b>said to him: This is</b> a baby who <b>put his head out of the corridor,</b> as otherwise his voice would not have been heard. Consequently, it is considered born already on Friday, which means that it should be circumcised on the following Friday, the eighth day after its birth. <b>And</b> if it is circumcised afterward, this <b>is a circumcision</b> performed <b>not at its</b> appointed <b>time, and</b> there is a <i>halakha</i> that although circumcision on the eighth day overrides Shabbat, nevertheless, with regard to <b>any circumcision</b> performed <b>not at its</b> appointed <b>time, one does not desecrate Shabbat for its</b> performance.
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to <b>that place in a woman,</b> i.e., her vagina, how is it defined? <b>Is</b> an impure substance located there considered <b>encapsulated, or is it</b> considered to be located in <b>a concealed part</b> of the body?
The Gemara explains: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> as to whether it is considered encapsulated or concealed? The difference is in a case <b>where another</b> woman <b>inserted an olive-bulk of an animal carcass,</b> which is the size that imparts impurity, <b>into that place. If you say</b> that <b>it is</b> considered <b>encapsulated, an encapsulated</b> source of <b>impurity does not impart impurity. But if you say</b> that <b>it is</b> considered located in <b>a concealed part</b> of the body, <b>although</b> the woman <b>does not become impure by contact, she at least becomes impure by carrying</b> the olive-bulk of the carcass.
<b>Abaye said: It is</b> considered <b>encapsulated. Rava said: It is</b> considered located in <b>a concealed part</b> of the body. <b>Rava</b> further <b>said: From where do I say</b> this? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “The woman also with whom a man shall lie carnally, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:18). Rabbi Shimon said: Now what does this verse teach? If it teaches that one who touches semen is rendered impure, this is derived from the verse: “Or a man from whom the flow of seed goes out” (Leviticus 22:4). <b>Rather,</b> it must be teaching that a woman who engages in intercourse is rendered impure by the man’s semen, despite the fact that the semen did not touch her on the outside of her body.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: This is a novelty <b>because</b> the semen <b>is</b> a source of <b>impurity</b> located in <b>a concealed part</b> of the body, <b>and</b> ordinarily contact with a source of <b>impurity</b> by <b>a concealed part</b> of the body <b>does not render</b> one <b>impure. But</b> here <b>it is a Torah edict</b> that the woman does become impure in this manner. Evidently, an impure substance in the vagina is considered located in a concealed part of the body.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Abaye,</b> how does he respond to Rava’s proof? The Gemara answers that Abaye would explain that the <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i>, Rabbi Shimon, <b>states one</b> reason <b>and</b> adds <b>another: One</b> reason <b>that</b> this <i>halakha</i> is a novelty is that semen in the vagina <b>is an encapsulated</b> substance of <b>impurity, and another</b> reason is that <b>even if you were to say</b> that the semen <b>is</b> considered located in <b>a concealed part</b> of the body, which ordinarily <b>does not render</b> one <b>impure, but</b> here, <b>it is a Torah edict</b> that the woman does become impure in this manner.
§ A similar <b>dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to the <b>place</b> in a person’s throat where <b>an unslaughtered carcass of a kosher bird</b> renders him ritually impure, how is it defined? <b>Is</b> the meat of the carcass considered <b>encapsulated, or is it</b> considered located in <b>a concealed part</b> of the body?
The Gemara explains: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference?</b> The difference is in a case <b>where another</b> individual <b>inserted an olive-bulk of an animal carcass into his mouth. If you say</b> that an impure item located in one’s throat <b>is</b> considered <b>encapsulated, an encapsulated</b> source of <b>impurity does not impart impurity.</b> But if <b>you say</b> that <b>it is</b> considered located in <b>a concealed part</b> of the body, <b>although</b> the one swallowing the meat of the carcass <b>indeed does not become impure by contact, he at least becomes impure by carrying</b> the meat.
Abaye and Rava disagree with regard to this issue as well. <b>Abaye said: It is</b> considered <b>encapsulated, and Rava said: It is</b> considered located in <b>a concealed part</b> of the body. <b>Abaye</b> further <b>said: From where do I say</b> that it is considered encapsulated? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>an animal carcass should impart impurity to garments</b> when it is <b>in</b> one’s <b>throat,</b> like an unslaughtered carcass of a kosher bird. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “That which dies of itself, or is torn of animals, he shall not eat to render himself impure through it”</b> (Leviticus 22:8).
The <i>baraita</i> continues: This verse, which is dealing with impurity through eating, applies to <b>that which has impurity only</b> by means of <b>its consumption,</b> i.e., an unslaughtered carcass of a kosher bird, which imparts impurity solely when it is in one’s throat. Therefore, the verse <b>excludes this</b> animal carcass from impurity by consumption, <b>as it is impure,</b> i.e., it imparts impurity, even <b>before one eats it,</b> by touch and carrying. This ruling, that other sources of impurity do not impart impurity in the throat, supports Abaye’s opinion that an item located in the throat is considered encapsulated, which is why it does not impart impurity.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And let it be derived</b> that an animal carcass imparts impurity to garments when it is in one’s throat <b>by an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>an unslaughtered carcass of a kosher bird,</b> in the following manner: <b>If an unslaughtered carcass of a kosher bird,</b> whose status is relatively lenient, <b>as it does not have impurity outside</b> the body, since if one touched it or carried it he is not rendered impure, and yet <b>it has impurity inside</b> the throat, then with regard to <b>this</b> animal carcass, whose status is more stringent, <b>as it does have impurity outside</b> the body, <b>is it not right that it</b> should <b>have impurity inside</b> the throat?
The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states:</b> “That which dies of itself, or is torn of animals, he shall not eat to become impure <b>through it,”</b> which indicates that one becomes impure when the item is in the throat only <b>through it,</b> i.e., an unslaughtered carcass of a kosher bird, <b>and not through another,</b> i.e., an animal carcass.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> with regard to an animal carcass: <b>“And he who eats</b> of its carcass shall wash his clothes and be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:40), which indicates that an animal carcass does impart impurity by means of consumption?
The Gemara explains that this verse is written <b>to provide a measure</b> for the impurity of an animal carcass, but this measure applies only <b>to one who touches and to one who carries</b> it, not to one who eats the carcass. This measure is <b>like</b> the amount that one <b>eats. Just as</b> the minimum amount that one <b>eats</b> is <b>an olive-bulk,</b> i.e., this is the minimum measure that has the halakhic status of consumption, <b>so too,</b> the minimum measure of an animal carcass that imparts impurity to one who <b>touches or carries</b> it is <b>an olive-bulk.</b>
§ The Gemara further discusses the impurity of a concealed part of the body. <b>Rava says:</b> If the carcass of a <b>creeping animal</b> is found <b>in the folds [<i>bekometo</i>] of</b> one’s body, e.g., the armpit, he is <b>ritually pure.</b> If the flesh of <b>an animal carcass</b> is found <b>in the folds of</b> one’s body, he is <b>impure.</b>
Rava elaborates: If the carcass of a <b>creeping animal</b> is found <b>in the folds of</b> one’s body he is <b>ritually pure,</b> as <b>it is through contact that a creeping animal imparts impurity, and a concealed part</b> of the body <b>is not susceptible to</b> impurity through <b>contact.</b> By contrast, if the flesh of <b>an animal carcass</b> is found <b>in the folds of</b> one’s body he is <b>impure,</b> as <b>although it does not impart impurity through contact,</b> since it is in a concealed part of the body, <b>it at least imparts impurity by carrying,</b> and he is considered to be carrying the animal carcass.
Rava further said: If there was the carcass of <b>a creeping animal in the folds of</b> one’s body, <b>and he brought</b> the creeping animal that was in the fold <b>into the airspace of</b> a large earthenware vessel, such as <b>an oven,</b> the oven is thereby rendered <b>impure,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> when a creeping animal is placed in its airspace. The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that as <b>the Merciful One states</b> with regard to the impurity of creeping animals: “And any earthenware vessel into <b>whose interior</b> any of them fall, whatever is in it shall be impure, and it you shall break” (Leviticus 11:33), this teaches that impurity applies only if the creeping animal fell inside the vessel itself,

Daf 43a

<b>and not</b> if it was in <b>the interior of its interior,</b> i.e., contained within something else, such as a fold, which is inside the vessel, therefore Rava <b>teaches us</b> that a fold in one’s body is not considered like the interior of the interior of a vessel. Rather, this definition applies only when the carcass of the creeping animal was actually inside another vessel whose opening was outside the oven.
§ The Gemara continues to discuss the folds in the body with regard to ritual impurity. <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> If there was <b>a pole</b> or a stick placed <b>in the folds of</b> an individual impure with the impurity of <b>a <i>zav</i>, and he moved a ritually pure</b> person <b>with it,</b> that individual is <b>pure,</b> despite the fact that a <i>zav</i> imparts impurity by moving an item. If the <b>pole</b> was placed <b>in the folds of one who is pure, and he moved the <i>zav</i> with it,</b> the pure individual is thereby rendered <b>impure,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> of one who carries a <i>zav</i>.
The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> that if a <i>zav</i> moved another with a pole in his own folds he does not render the other person impure? <b>As the verse states: “And whoever a <i>zav</i> touches, without having rinsed his hands in water,</b> he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water” (Leviticus 15:11). <b>This is</b> referring to the impurity imparted by <b>the movement of a <i>zav</i>, as we have not found an impurity</b> similar <b>to it in the entire Torah.</b> Only a <i>zav</i> imparts impurity to items by moving them.
<b>And the Merciful One expresses</b> this impurity imparted <b>by</b> movement using <b>the language of touch,</b> in order <b>to say that</b> the <b>moving and touch</b> of a <i>zav</i> <b>are like his hands: Just as there,</b> with regard to the impurity imparted by contact with the hands, it occurs <b>external</b> to the body, <b>so too here,</b> impurity by means of movement applies only to moving an item with the <b>external</b> portions of the body of the <i>zav</i>.
§ The mishna teaches that a woman becomes ritually impure with the flow of blood from the uterus into the vagina, even if it did not leave the woman’s body. <b>But the <i>zav</i> and one who experiences a seminal emission do not become ritually impure</b> until their emission of impurity emerges outside the body. The Gemara explains: This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a <i>zav</i>, as it is written: “When</b> any man <b>has an issue out of his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 15:2). The verse teaches that a <i>zav</i> is not impure <b>until his issue emerges out of his flesh.</b> With regard to <b>one who experiences a seminal emission,</b> the reason is <b>that it is written: “And if the flow of seed goes out from a man”</b> (Leviticus 15:16), which indicates that the flow must exit his body.
§ The mishna further states that if a priest <b>was partaking of <i>teruma</i> and sensed</b> a quaking in his limbs, indicating that a seminal emission was imminent, he should firmly hold his penis to prevent the emission from leaving his body, and swallow the <i>teruma</i> while ritually pure. The Gemara asks: May one <b>hold</b> his penis? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Anyone who holds</b> his <b>penis and urinates</b> is considered <b>as though he is bringing a deluge to the world,</b> as masturbation was one of the sins that led to the flood?
<b>Abaye said,</b> in resolution of this difficulty, that the mishna is referring to one who holds his penis <b>with a coarse cloth. Rava said: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna is referring to a priest who holds his penis <b>with a soft cloth,</b> and the reason it is permitted is that <b>once</b> the semen <b>has</b> already <b>been uprooted</b> from his body, it is <b>uprooted,</b> and his subsequent holding of the penis, even with a soft cloth, does not increase the flow of semen. <b>And Abaye</b> prohibits the use of a soft cloth, as he is <b>concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> one might <b>come to increase</b> the emission of semen, due to the contact of this cloth. <b>But Rava is not concerned</b> that one might <b>come to increase</b> the emission.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to the opinion of Rava. <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>To what is this</b> holding of a penis <b>comparable?</b> It is comparable <b>to</b> one who <b>places a finger in</b> his <b>eye,</b> in <b>that as long as</b> the <b>finger</b> is <b>in the eye,</b> the eye <b>will tear and continue to tear.</b> Here too, the priest’s action will lead to an increased emission of semen.
The Gemara answers that <b>Rava</b> would maintain that if the priest’s limbs were not quaking and the semen was coming out in drops, there is indeed a concern that holding the penis might increase the emission. But when he feels his limbs quaking, this concern does not apply. The reason is that <b>any</b> such event, i.e., <b>a heating</b> of the body that leads to a seminal emission <b>and</b> which is <b>then</b> followed by another <b>heating</b> of that kind <b>at the time</b> when the semen has been uprooted, is <b>uncommon.</b> Consequently, in this case the priest may hold his penis even with a soft cloth.
<b>Shmuel says: Any</b> emission of <b>semen that is not felt by one’s entire body does not render</b> him <b>impure. What is the reason? The Merciful One states: “The flow of seed”</b> (Leviticus 15:16), which indicates that it is referring to an emission <b>that is fit to fertilize,</b> i.e., it is referring only to the kind of emission which is felt as it exits the body.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 8:3): If one <b>was having</b> sexual <b>thoughts at night and he arose and found</b> that <b>his flesh</b> was <b>warm, he is ritually impure,</b> despite the fact that he did not sense the emission of semen. This shows that the impurity of a seminal emission applies even if one did not feel it in his entire body. The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Huna interpreted</b> this mishna as referring <b>to</b> one who <b>engaged in intercourse in his dream. Since it is impossible to engage in intercourse without</b> the accompanying <b>sensation,</b> he certainly must have felt it, despite the fact that he was unaware of this when he awoke.
The Gemara cites <b>another version</b> of the above statement. <b>Shmuel says: Any semen that is not shot like an arrow does not render</b> one <b>impure.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> practical difference <b>is there between this version</b> of Shmuel’s ruling <b>and that version</b> of Shmuel’s ruling? The Gemara answers that the difference <b>between them</b> is a case where the semen <b>was uprooted</b> accompanied <b>by a sensation, but it emerged without a sensation.</b> According to the first version the man is rendered impure, as he sensed the uprooting of the semen, whereas according to the second version he is not impure, as this is not considered semen shot like an arrow.
The Gemara notes that this <b>matter, which</b> is <b>obvious to Shmuel, is raised as a dilemma by Rava. As Rava raises a dilemma:</b> If semen <b>was uprooted</b> accompanied <b>by a sensation but it emerged without a sensation, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is the man ritually impure or not?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 8:3): With regard to <b>one who experienced a seminal emission,</b> and <b>who</b> subsequently <b>immersed but did not urinate</b> before doing so, <b>when he</b> later <b>urinates</b> he is rendered <b>impure,</b> as some semen will also be emitted. The reason that he is rendered impure by this emission, which he does not sense, must be because the uprooting of the semen was accompanied by a sensation. The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>There it is different, as the majority</b> of the semen <b>emerged</b> accompanied <b>by a sensation,</b> and therefore he is rendered impure by this small amount even without a sensation.
<b>Some say another version</b> of the previous discussion. <b>Shmuel says: Any semen that is not shot like an arrow cannot fertilize,</b> i.e., impregnate a woman. The Gemara infers: <b>It cannot fertilize, but it does render</b> the man who emits it <b>ritually impure, as it is stated: “If there be among you any man who is not ritually pure by reason of that which happened to him</b> by night” (Deuteronomy 23:11). This teaches that <b>even mere semen</b> which cannot fertilize renders one impure.
<b>Rava raises</b> a similar <b>dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a gentile who had</b> sexual <b>thoughts,</b> on account of which semen was uprooted but not emitted from his body, <b>and he</b> subsequently <b>descended and immersed</b> for the purpose of conversion, which means that he is now Jewish, and he then emitted semen, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to his status of ritual purity?
The Gemara explains the dilemma: Even <b>if you say</b> that <b>we follow</b> the moment of <b>uprooting,</b> at which point he was still a gentile, one can maintain that <b>this statement</b> applies only when it entails <b>a stringency,</b> as is the case with regard to a born Jew. <b>But here, where</b> this would lead <b>to a leniency,</b> as the gentile would be ritually pure, perhaps <b>we do not say</b> that one follows the moment of uprooting. <b>Or perhaps</b> there <b>is no difference</b> in the application of this principle between a born Jew and a convert, but rather, one always follows the moment of uprooting. The Gemara concludes that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rava raises</b> a further <b>dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a woman who experienced a discharge of uterine blood after her menstrual period [<i>zava</i>], whose urine,</b> which imparts impurity like all liquids that she discharges vaginally, <b>was uprooted</b> but not emitted from her body, <b>and she descended</b> to the ritual bath <b>and immersed</b> to purify herself from her <i>ziva</i>, and urinated afterward, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
The Gemara explains the sides of the dilemma: Even <b>if you say</b> that generally <b>we follow</b> the moment of <b>uprooting,</b> and therefore she should be impure, since the urine was uprooted when she was a <i>zava</i>, nevertheless one can claim that <b>this statement</b> applies only with regard to <b>semen, as</b> the man <b>cannot hold it</b> back from emission. <b>But</b> with regard to the <b>urine of</b> a <i>zava</i>, <b>which she can hold in,</b> one does <b>not</b> follow the moment of uprooting. <b>Or perhaps</b> there <b>is no difference</b> in the application of this principle between urine and semen, but rather, in both cases one follows the moment of uprooting. Here too, the Gemara concludes that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rava raises</b> yet another <b>dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a gentile <i>zava</i>,</b> who is not impure by Torah law, although by rabbinic law she is considered a <i>zava</i> in all regards, <b>whose urine was uprooted</b> when she was a gentile,

Daf 43b

<b>and she descended</b> to the ritual bath <b>and immersed</b> for the sake of conversion, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
Once again, the Gemara explains the dilemma: <b>If you say</b> that <b>we follow</b> the moment of <b>uprooting even though she can hold in</b> the urine, nevertheless one can claim that <b>this statement</b> applies specifically to <b>a Jewish woman, who is impure by Torah law. But</b> with regard to <b>a gentile <i>zava</i>, who is impure by rabbinic law,</b> it is possible that one does <b>not</b> follow the moment of uprooting. <b>Or perhaps</b> there <b>is no difference</b> in the application of this principle between the case of a Jewish woman and a gentile woman, as in both cases one follows the moment of uprooting. The Gemara again concludes that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The mishna teaches that the emission of a <i>zav</i> and a seminal emission <b>impart impurity in any amount. Shmuel says:</b> In order for <b>a <i>zav</i></b> to become ritually impure, he <b>must</b> experience a discharge substantial enough <b>to</b> cause <b>a blockage of the tip of the penis, as it is stated:</b> “And this shall be his impurity in his issue: Whether his flesh run with his issue, <b>or his flesh be stopped from his issue,</b> it is his impurity” (Leviticus 15:3).
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that the emission of a <i>zav</i> and a seminal emission <b>impart impurity in any amount?</b> The Gemara answers that Shmuel <b>said</b> his ruling <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Natan, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Natan says in the name of Rabbi Yishmael:</b> In order for <b>a <i>zav</i></b> to become ritually impure, he <b>must</b> experience a discharge substantial enough <b>to</b> cause <b>a blockage of the tip of the penis, but</b> the Rabbis <b>did not concede to his</b> opinion, as they maintain that any amount is sufficient. The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna agrees with the opinion of the Rabbis, whereas Shmuel agrees with the statement of Rabbi Natan in the name of Rabbi Yishmael.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yishmael,</b> i.e., what is the source in the Torah for his ruling? The Gemara answers: His source is, as mentioned above, <b>that the verse states:</b> “And this shall be his impurity in his issue: Whether his flesh run with his issue, <b>or his flesh be stopped from his issue,</b> it is his impurity” (Leviticus 15:3). This verse indicates that the emission must be enough to cause a blockage of his penis.
The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yishmael, what do they derive from this verse? The Gemara explains that according to the Rabbis, <b>that</b> verse <b>is necessary</b> to teach a different <i>halakha</i> with regard to a <i>zav</i>, that it is only a discharge which is <b>moist,</b> and which therefore could cause a blockage of the organ, that <b>imparts impurity, but a dry</b> discharge does <b>not impart impurity.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> from where does <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> derive that only a moist discharge imparts impurity? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived from</b> the word <b>“run”</b> in the verse “And this shall be his impurity in his issue: Whether his flesh run with his issue.”
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what do <b>the Rabbis</b> derive from this word? The Gemara explains that according to the Rabbis, <b>that</b> verse <b>comes to</b> teach the <b>number</b> of emissions by which a <i>zav</i> is rendered impure, as follows: The term <b>“his issue”</b> is <b>one</b> emission, the term <b>“his flesh run”</b> is another emission so that there are <b>two</b> emissions, and the term <b>“with his issue”</b> makes a total of <b>three</b> emissions. The verse thereby <b>teaches with regard to a <i>zav</i> who experienced three emissions that</b> he <b>is obligated to</b> bring <b>an offering</b> as part of his purification process.
The Gemara continues: From the last section of the verse: <b>“Or his flesh be stopped from his issue,</b> it is his <b>impurity,”</b> it is derived that one is <b>impure</b> even by means of <b>part of his issue,</b> i.e., even if he did not experience three emissions. Here the verse <b>teaches with regard to a <i>zav</i> who experienced two emissions that</b> although he is not obligated to bring an offering, he <b>renders</b> a surface designated for <b>lying and</b> a surface designated for <b>sitting ritually impure</b> by lying or sitting on them, even without touching them directly. The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yishmael, from where does he</b> derive this <i>halakha</i> of the requisite <b>number</b> of emissions? The Gemara answers that <b>he derives it from that</b> which <b>Rabbi Simai</b> said.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Simai says: The verse enumerated two</b> emissions <b>and called</b> the <i>zav</i> <b>impure:</b> “When any man has an emission out of his flesh, due to his issue he is impure” (Leviticus 15:2). And yet, another verse enumerates <b>three</b> emissions <b>and it</b> too <b>called him impure:</b> “And this shall be his impurity in his emission: Whether his flesh runs with his emission, or his flesh be stopped from his emission, it is his impurity” (Leviticus 15:3). <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> verses be reconciled? If one is impure after two emissions, for what purpose does the Torah mention three? It is to teach that <b>two</b> emissions are necessary <b>to</b> establish <b>impurity, and three</b> are necessary <b>to</b> render a <i>zav</i> liable to bring <b>an offering.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who derives both</b> the <i>halakha</i> of impurity and the obligation to bring an offering <b>from</b> the single verse: “And <b>this shall be his impurity in his issue,” what do they,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>do with</b> the other verse: <b>“When any man has an emission out of his flesh”?</b> The Gemara answers that this verse is <b>necessary</b> to teach the <i>halakha</i> that a <i>zav</i> is not impure <b>unless</b> the discharge <b>emerges from his flesh.</b>
The Gemara further asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the last part of the previous verse, which can be read as: <b>His issue is impure</b> (Leviticus 15:2)? The Gemara explains that this <b>teaches with regard to the issue</b> itself <b>that it is impure,</b> i.e., not only does it render the man who emitted it impure, but the substance itself is impure and imparts impurity to others by contact.
§ With regard to the statement of the mishna that the issue of the <i>zav</i> and a seminal emission render them impure in any amount, <b>Rav Ḥanilai says in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon: Semen</b> imparts impurity <b>to</b> the man who <b>emits</b> it <b>in any amount,</b> whereas <b>with regard to one who touches</b> semen, it imparts impurity only <b>in</b> the amount of <b>a lentil-bulk.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that the emission of a <i>zav</i> and a seminal emission <b>impart impurity in any amount? What, is it not</b> referring to <b>one who touches</b> semen? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the mishna is referring <b>to</b> the man who <b>emits</b> it.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: There is an element of <b>stringency</b> which applies <b>to</b> the impurity of <b>semen that</b> does not apply <b>to</b> the impurity of the carcass of <b>a creeping animal, and</b> likewise there is an element of <b>stringency</b> which applies <b>to</b> the impurity of the carcass of <b>a creeping animal that</b> does not apply <b>to</b> the impurity of <b>semen.</b> The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: The <b>stringency</b> which applies <b>to</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal</b> but not to semen is <b>that</b> with regard to the carcass of <b>a creeping animal there is no differentiation in its impurity, which is not the case with regard to semen,</b> as certain types of semen impart impurity while others do not. The <b>stringency</b> which applies <b>to semen</b> but not to the carcass of a creeping animal is <b>that semen imparts impurity in any amount, which is not the case with regard to</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal,</b> which must be at least a lentil-bulk.
The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: <b>What, is it not</b> referring <b>to one who touches</b> semen, and the <i>baraita</i> rules that he is rendered impure by any amount? The Gemara again answers: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is speaking <b>of</b> the man who <b>emits</b> semen, whereas one who touches it becomes impure only if it is at least as large as a lentil-bulk.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this answer: <b>But</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> the case of semen as <b>similar to</b> that of the carcass of <b>a creeping animal,</b> which indicates that <b>just as</b> the impurity of the carcass of <b>a creeping animal</b> is imparted <b>by contact, so too,</b> the impurity discussed in the <i>baraita</i> with regard to <b>semen</b> is imparted <b>by contact. Rav Adda bar Ahava said</b> in response: The <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches the category of</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal, and</b> it likewise <b>teaches the category of semen,</b> i.e., it is referring to these types of impurity in general, but this does not mean that these types of impurity are contracted in the same manner.
The Gemara asks: <b>And does</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal not impart impurity in any amount? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 1:7): <b>The limbs</b> of impure bodies that are whole <b>have no</b> minimum <b>measure</b> with regard to imparting ritual impurity. Even if a limb is <b>less than an olive-bulk of</b> a human <b>corpse, or less than an olive-bulk of an animal carcass, or less than a lentil-bulk of</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal,</b> it imparts ritual impurity. If so, how can the <i>baraita</i> state that there is a minimum measure of a lentil-bulk with regard to the impurity of a creeping animal?
The Gemara answers that the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a limb is different, as</b> when <b>all of it</b> is intact <b>it stands in place of a lentil</b>-bulk, i.e., a whole limb is considered like a lentil-bulk of the carcass of a creeping animal, regardless of its actual size. The proof is <b>that if</b> it were <b>lacking</b> any slight <b>bit,</b> thereby causing this <b>limb</b> of a creeping animal to be less than a lentil-bulk, <b>would it impart impurity?</b> Certainly not. Clearly, then, the impurity of a limb is due to its wholeness, not its size.
The <i>baraita</i> teaches: The stringency that applies to the carcass of a creeping animal but not to semen is that with regard to a creeping animal there is no differentiation concerning its impurity, which is not the case with regard to semen. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the differentiation</b> with regard to <b>the impurity of semen? If we say</b> that this is referring to the difference <b>between</b> the semen of <b>Jews,</b> to which this impurity applies, <b>and</b> the semen <b>of gentiles,</b> to which it does not apply, <b>there is also</b> a differentiation with regard to the impurity of the carcass of a creeping animal between <b>a sea mouse,</b> which is not impure, and <b>a land mouse,</b> which is impure.
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to the differentiation <b>between</b> the emission of <b>a minor,</b> which is not classified as semen and which does not render him impure, <b>and</b> that of <b>an adult,</b> which does render him impure. By contrast, there is no such differentiation with regard to the impurity of the carcass of a creeping animal, as it imparts impurity regardless of its age and size.
§ <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The amount of semen which imparts impurity to one who touches it is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is stated in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the Torah <b>includes one who touches semen,</b> in addition to one who emits semen, as impure? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the impurity of the carcass of a creeping animal: <b>“Or whoever</b> touches any creeping animal, whereby he may become impure” (Leviticus 22:5). It is inferred from the inclusive phrase “or whoever” that one who touches semen is also impure.
<b>And in general, <i>tanna’im</i> disagree</b> with regard to the possibility of deriving a <i>halakha</i> in this manner. <b>As some say</b> with regard to a <i>halakha</i> that is inferred from another <i>halakha</i>: <b>Infer from it, and</b> derive the details of the <i>halakha</i> <b>from it</b> as well. <b>And some say</b> with regard to such a <i>halakha</i>: <b>Infer from it, but interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> according <b>to its</b> own <b>place,</b> i.e., not all aspects of the source case are applied to this <i>halakha</i>.
The Gemara explains how this general dispute applies to the case at hand. <b>According to the one who says</b> that one <b>infers from it and</b> again <b>from it,</b> the derivation is as follows: <b>Just as</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal</b> imparts impurity <b>by contact, so too, semen</b> imparts impurity <b>by contact. And</b> one again infers <b>from</b> the impurity of the carcass of a creeping animal that <b>just as</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal</b> imparts impurity <b>in</b> the amount of <b>a lentil-bulk, so too, semen</b> imparts impurity <b>in</b> the amount of <b>a lentil-bulk.</b>
<b>And according to the one who says: Infer from it, but interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> according <b>to</b> its own <b>place,</b> one derives as follows: <b>Just as</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal</b> imparts impurity <b>by contact, so too, semen</b> imparts impurity <b>by contact. But</b> one must <b>interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> according <b>to</b> its own <b>place: Just as semen</b> imparts impurity <b>to the one who emits</b> it <b>in any amount, so too,</b> it imparts impurity <b>to the one who touches</b> it <b>in any amount.</b>
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan, said to Rav Pappa: From where</b> do you infer <b>that</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>derives</b> the impurity of one who touches semen <b>from</b> the phrase <b>“or whoever”</b> that is stated with regard to the impurity <b>of</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal? Perhaps he derives it from</b> the previous verse: <b>“Or from whoever the flow of seed goes out”</b> (Leviticus 22:4), <b>and everyone</b> agrees that when a <i>halakha</i> is derived from a verse dealing with the same matter, one should <b>infer from it and</b> derive the details of the <i>halakha</i> <b>from it</b> as well. If so, the amount of semen that imparts impurity by contact should be derived from the amount that renders the one who emitted it impure, which is any amount.
The Gemara relates that the Sages <b>asked the <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> i.e., those who recite <i>mishnayot</i> and <i>baraitot</i>, whether the derivation of the <i>baraita</i> is from the verse dealing with the carcass of a creeping animal or from the one dealing with semen. They discovered that <b>there are those who teach</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the assumption of <b>Rav Pappa,</b> that it is derived from a creeping animal, <b>and there are those who teach</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan,</b> that the source is the verse referring to semen.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A baby girl,</b> even one who is <b>one day old,</b> who experiences an emission of blood, <b>becomes impure with</b> the impurity of <b>a menstruating woman.</b> A baby girl who is <b>ten days old</b> who experiences an emission of blood for three consecutive days after the conclusion of the seven days fit for menstruation <b>becomes impure with</b> the impurity of <b><i>ziva</i>,</b> and is therefore obligated to observe seven clean days before immersion.
<b>A baby boy,</b> even one who is <b>one day old, becomes impure with</b> the impurity of <b><i>ziva</i>; and becomes impure with</b> the impurity of <b>leprous marks; and becomes impure with impurity</b> imparted by <b>a corpse; and he creates</b> a levirate bond requiring the widow of his childless brother <b>to</b> enter into <b>levirate marriage</b> with him; <b>and he exempts</b> his widowed mother <b>from the</b> obligation of <b>levirate marriage,</b> freeing her to marry anyone she chooses; <b>and he enables</b> his mother, an Israelite woman who is no longer married to his father, a priest, to continue <b>to partake of <i>teruma</i>; and he disqualifies</b> his mother, the daughter of a priest who is no longer married to his father, an Israelite man, <b>from</b> continuing to partake of <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> because the child is unfit to partake of <i>teruma</i>;

Daf 44a

<b>and he inherits</b> the estate of his mother if she died on the day of his birth; <b>and</b> if he dies, <b>he bequeaths</b> that inheritance to his paternal brothers; <b>and one who kills him is liable</b> for his murder, as it is written: “And he that smites any man mortally shall be put to death” (Leviticus 24:17), i.e., any man, including a child who is one day old; <b>and</b> if he dies, <b>his</b> status in relation <b>to his father and to his mother and to all his relatives,</b> in terms of the <i>halakhot</i> of mourning, is <b>like</b> that of <b>a full-fledged groom [<i>keḥatan shalem</i>],</b> whose death is deeply mourned.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter,</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of menstruation apply even to a one-day-old baby girl, derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And if a woman has an issue, and her issue in her flesh is blood, she shall be in her impurity seven days” (Leviticus 15:19). When the verse states <b>“a woman,” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of menstruation apply to an adult <b>woman. From where</b> do I derive that the impurity <b>of a menstruating woman</b> also applies to <b>a one-day-old</b> baby? <b>The verse states: “And a woman,”</b> to include even a baby girl.
The mishna further teaches that a baby girl who is <b>ten days old</b> who experiences an emission of blood for three consecutive days after the conclusion of the seven days fit for menstruation, becomes impure with the impurity <b>of <i>ziva</i>.</b> Again, the Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And if a woman has an issue of her blood many days not in the time of her menstruation…she shall be as in the days of her menstruation: She is impure” (Leviticus 15:25). When the verse states <b>“a woman,” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of a <i>zava</i> apply to an adult <b>woman. From where</b> do I derive that the impurity <b>of <i>ziva</i></b> also applies to <b>a ten-day-old</b> baby? <b>The verse states: “And a woman,”</b> to include even a baby girl.
The mishna further teaches that <b>a baby boy,</b> even one who is <b>one day old,</b> can become impure with the impurity of <i>ziva</i>. Once again, the Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a <i>zav</i>: “When <b>any man</b> has an issue out of his flesh, his issue is impure” (Leviticus 15:2). It would have been enough for the verse to state “a man.” <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state “any man”?</b> It is in order <b>to include</b> even <b>a one-day-old</b> baby boy who has such a discharge, to teach <b>that he becomes impure with</b> the impurity of <b><i>ziva</i>.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says</b> that this derivation <b>is not necessary, as</b> the verse <b>states: “And of those who have an issue, whether it be a male or a female”</b> (Leviticus 15:33). The phrase <b>“whether it be a male”</b> includes <b>anyone</b> who is a male, <b>whether</b> he is <b>an adult</b> or <b>whether</b> he is <b>a minor; “or a female”</b> includes <b>anyone</b> who is a female, <b>whether</b> she is <b>an adult</b> or <b>whether</b> she is <b>a minor. If so, why</b> must <b>the</b> earlier <b>verse state “any man”? The Torah spoke in the language of people,</b> i.e., this emphasis is not unusual and therefore one should not derive a <i>halakha</i> from the superfluous word.
The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> a one-day-old baby <b>becomes impure with</b> the impurity of <b>leprous marks.</b> The Gemara explains that this is derived from that <b>which is written</b> with regard to leprous marks: <b>“When a person shall have in the skin of his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 13:2). This serves to include <b>anyone who is a person,</b> irrespective of age.
The mishna further teaches: <b>And</b> a one-day-old baby <b>becomes impure with impurity</b> imparted by <b>a corpse.</b> The Gemara explains that this is derived from that <b>which is written</b> in the context of purification from impurity imparted by a corpse: “And a pure person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, <b>and upon the people that were there”</b> (Numbers 19:18). This apparently superfluous mention of “people” serves to include <b>anyone who is a person,</b> irrespective of age.
The mishna also teaches: <b>And</b> a one-day-old baby <b>creates</b> a levirate bond requiring the widow of his childless brother <b>to</b> enter into <b>levirate marriage</b> with him. The Gemara explains that this is derived from that <b>which is written: “If brothers dwell together</b> and one of them dies, and he has no child, the wife of the dead man shall not be married outside of the family to one not of his kin. Her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her and take her to him to be his wife, and consummate the levirate marriage” (Deuteronomy 25:5). This verse is referring to <b>brothers who had one dwelling in the world,</b> i.e., who were alive at the same time, which includes a baby who was born the day his brother died.
The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> a one-day-old baby <b>exempts</b> his widowed mother <b>from the</b> obligation of <b>levirate marriage.</b> The Gemara explains the derivation: <b>The Merciful One states:</b> “And one of them dies, <b>and he has no child”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), <b>and this</b> late husband <b>has</b> a child, albeit one who is one day old.
The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> a one-day-old baby <b>enables</b> his mother, an Israelite woman who is no longer married to his father, a priest, to continue <b>to partake of <i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara explains that this is <b>as it is written,</b> with regard to those who are entitled to partake of <i>teruma</i> on account of a priest: <b>“And those who are born in his house, they may eat [<i>yokhelu</i>] of his bread”</b> (Leviticus 22:11). <b>Read into</b> the verse: Those who are born in his house <b>enable others to eat [<i>ya’akhilu</i>] of his bread,</b> i.e., on account of her son the priest, the Israelite mother may continue to partake of <i>teruma</i> even after the death of his father.
§ The mishna also teaches: <b>And</b> a one-day-old baby <b>disqualifies</b> his mother, the daughter of a priest who is no longer married to his father, an Israelite man, <b>from</b> continuing to partake of <b><i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara explains that the reason is that <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “But if a priest’s daughter becomes a widow, or divorced, <b>and has no child,</b> and is returned to her father’s house, as in her youth, she may eat of her father’s bread” (Leviticus 22:13), <b>and this</b> daughter of a priest <b>has</b> a child.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> state <b>specifically</b> that she has <b>a child? Even</b> if she has <b>a fetus</b> in her womb from an Israelite man, the same <i>halakha</i> applies, <b>as it is written: “As in her youth,”</b> which <b>excludes a pregnant woman,</b> since her pregnancy has changed her physical state from that of her youth.
The Gemara answers that both derivations <b>are necessary. As, if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“And has no child,”</b> I would say that the reason the daughter of a priest who has a child from an Israelite man may no longer partake of <i>teruma</i> is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that at the outset,</b> before she married, she was <b>one body, and now</b> she has developed into <b>two bodies,</b> herself and her child. <b>But here,</b> in a case when she is merely pregnant, <b>when at the outset</b> she was <b>one body and now</b> she remains <b>one body,</b> one might <b>say</b> that <b>she should</b> be permitted to <b>partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “As in her youth.”</b>
<b>And</b> by contrast, <b>if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“As in her youth,”</b> I would say that the reason that the daughter of a priest who is pregnant from an Israelite man may no longer partake of <i>teruma</i> is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that at the outset</b> she had <b>an empty body and now</b> she has <b>a full body,</b> and consequently she is not returning to her father’s household in her initial state. <b>But here,</b> after she has given birth, <b>where at the outset</b> she had <b>an empty body and now</b> she still has <b>an empty body,</b> one might <b>say</b> that <b>she should</b> be permitted to <b>partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>. Therefore, the Merciful One writes: “And has no child.” Therefore, both derivations are <b>necessary.</b>
The Gemara asks: The need for both <b>verses</b> has been <b>resolved, but the mishna</b> remains difficult: <b>What</b> is the reason the mishna is referring <b>specifically</b> to a baby who is <b>one day old,</b> when, as stated above, the same <i>halakha</i> applies <b>even</b> to <b>a fetus? Rav Sheshet said: Here we are dealing with a priest who has two wives: One</b> who is <b>a divorcée,</b> as she was previously divorced from another man, and who was therefore married to this priest in violation of <i>halakha</i>, <b>and one who is not a divorcée. And he has sons from</b> the wife <b>who is not a divorcée, and he has</b> a baby boy who is <b>one day old from the</b> wife who is <b>a divorcée.</b> This son is disqualified from the priesthood and may not partake of <i>teruma</i>.
Rav Sheshet continues: The mishna is teaching <b>that</b> this baby <b>disqualifies his father’s</b> Canaanite <b>slaves from partaking of <i>teruma</i></b> again. Since this child is entitled to a portion of his father’s inheritance, which includes his slaves, they may no longer partake of <i>teruma</i> due to his presence in the world. <b>And</b> the mishna teaches this <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei, who said</b> that <b>a fetus also disqualifies</b> his father’s slaves from partaking of <i>teruma</i>. For this reason, the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that with regard to <b>a one-day-old</b> baby boy, <b>yes,</b> he disqualifies his father’s slaves from partaking of <i>teruma</i>, but <b>a fetus</b> does <b>not.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that this baby <b>inherits and he bequeaths.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From whom does he inherit?</b> It must be <b>from his father. And to whom does he bequeath?</b> Presumably, he bequeaths <b>to his paternal brother,</b> in a case where the baby inherited his father’s property and then died on the same day, as maternal half-brothers do not inherit from each other. The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this interpretation: What is the novelty of the <i>halakha</i> that the brother of this one-day-old baby inherits from him? After all, <b>if</b> the surviving brother <b>wants, let him inherit from his father, and if he wants, let him inherit from</b> the one-day-old baby. Either way, he receives his late father’s property.
<b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> The mishna is teaching that a one-day-old baby <b>inherits his mother’s property</b> if she died on the day he was born, so that he is able <b>to bequeath</b> it, even if he dies after a day, <b>to</b> his heirs who are not the mother’s heirs, e.g., <b>a paternal half-brother. And</b> in such a case it is <b>specifically</b> when he is at least <b>one day old</b> that he inherits from his mother and bequeaths the property to his paternal half-brothers, <b>but a fetus,</b> whose mother died before he emerged, does <b>not</b> inherit from his mother. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The reason is <b>that</b> presumably the fetus <b>died first,</b> before its mother died, <b>and</b> there is a <i>halakha</i> that <b>a son does not inherit from his mother</b>

Daf 44b

while <b>in the grave,</b> i.e., after death, <b>in order to bequeath to his paternal half-brother.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so,</b> that it is presumed that the fetus died before its mother? <b>But wasn’t there an incident</b> in which the mother died <b>and</b> the fetus <b>made up to three spasmodic motions</b> afterward? <b>Mar, son of Rav Ashi, said:</b> That is <b>just as it is with the tail of the lizard, which twitches</b> after being severed from the lizard, but it is merely a spasmodic motion which does not indicate that it is still alive.
<b>Mar, son of Rav Yosef, said</b> a different explanation of the mishna’s ruling <b>in the name of Rava:</b> The mishna teaches that a one-day-old baby inherits in order <b>to say that</b> such a child <b>reduces the portion of the firstborn.</b> A firstborn is entitled to a double portion of the inheritance, which is calculated by taking into account the portion due to his dead brother. <b>And Mar, son of Rav Yosef,</b> further <b>said in the name of Rava: A son who was born after his father’s death does not reduce the portion of the firstborn.</b> Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> in the mishna does not apply to a fetus. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>We require</b> fulfillment of the verse: “If a man has two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, <b>and they bore him children”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:15), and this does not apply to a fetus not yet born at the time of the father’s death.
The Gemara notes: <b>In Sura they taught</b> Mar’s statement <b>that</b> way, whereas <b>in Pumbedita they taught</b> it <b>this</b> way: <b>Mar, son of Rav Yosef, said in the name of Rava: A firstborn who was born after his father’s death does not receive a double</b> portion. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>We require</b> fulfillment of the verse: “But <b>he shall acknowledge</b> the firstborn…by giving him a double portion” (Deuteronomy 21:17), <b>and</b> in this case the father <b>is not</b> there to acknowledge him.
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with all these versions of</b> the statement of <b>Mar, son of Rav Yosef, in the name of Rava,</b> i.e., a one-day-old baby reduces the portion of the firstborn, a son born after his father’s death does not reduce the portion of the firstborn, and a firstborn born after his father’s death does not receive a double portion.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And one who kills</b> a one-day-old baby is <b>liable</b> for his murder. The Gemara explains that the reason for this is <b>as it is written: “And he who smites any man mortally</b> shall be put to death” (Leviticus 24:17), where the phrase “any man” indicates that this verse applies <b>in any case,</b> even in the case of a one-day-old baby.
The mishna further teaches: <b>And</b> if a one-day-old baby dies, <b>his</b> status in relation <b>to his father and to his mother and to all his relatives</b> is <b>like</b> that of <b>a full-fledged groom.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is this stated? <b>Rav Pappa said: With regard to mourning.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this stated? It is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, who said: With regard to humans, any</b> child <b>that remained</b> alive <b>thirty days</b> after birth <b>is not</b> considered <b>a non-viable newborn.</b> It can be inferred from this statement that if <b>he did not remain</b> alive for thirty days after birth, <b>he is</b> of <b>uncertain</b> status. The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where one is certain that its months</b> of gestation <b>were completed,</b> and therefore it is certainly a viable newborn.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A girl</b> who is <b>three years and one day old,</b> whose father arranged her betrothal, <b>is betrothed through intercourse,</b> as the halakhic status of intercourse with her is that of intercourse in all halakhic senses. <b>And</b> in a case where the childless husband of a girl three years and one day old dies, <b>if</b> his brother the <b><i>yavam</i> engages in intercourse with her, he acquires her</b> as his wife; <b>and</b> if she is married, a man other than her husband <b>is liable for</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>her due to</b> violation of the prohibition against intercourse with <b>a married woman.</b>
<b>And</b> if she is impure due to menstruation, <b>she imparts impurity to one who engages in intercourse with her</b> who then <b>renders impure</b> all the layers of <b>bedding beneath</b> him, rendering them impure <b>like the upper</b> bedding covering a <i>zav</i>, in the sense that it assumes first-degree ritual impurity and does not become a primary source of ritual impurity, and it renders impure food and drink, but it does not render impure people and vessels.
If <b>she marries a priest, she may partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> like any other wife of a priest; if she is unmarried and <b>one</b> of the men <b>who are unfit</b> for the priesthood, e.g., a <i>mamzer</i> or <i>ḥalal</i>, <b>engaged in intercourse with her, he disqualifies her from</b> marrying into <b>the priesthood,</b> and if she is the daughter of a priest, she is disqualified from partaking of <i>teruma</i>. Finally, if <b>one of all those with whom relations are forbidden,</b> as <b>stated in the Torah,</b> e.g., her father or her husband’s father, <b>engaged in intercourse with her, they are executed</b> by the court <b>for</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>her, and she is exempt,</b> because she is a minor.
If the girl is <b>less than that</b> age, younger than three years and one day, the status of intercourse with her is not that of intercourse in all halakhic senses; rather, it is <b>like placing a finger into the eye.</b> Just as in that case, the eye constricts, sheds tears, and then returns to its original state, so too, in a girl younger than three years and one day old, the hymen returns to its original state.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A girl</b> who is <b>three years</b> old <b>is betrothed through intercourse;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> She must be <b>three years and one day old.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between</b> their opinions, as both agree that she cannot be betrothed before the age of three? The Sages <b>of the school of Rabbi Yannai said:</b> There is a difference <b>between</b> their opinions in the case of a girl on <b>the eve of the first day of</b> the fourth <b>year</b> of her life. According to Rabbi Meir, she can be betrothed through intercourse, as on this day three years are complete, whereas the Rabbis maintain that she cannot be betrothed in this manner, as she has not yet entered the first day of her fourth year.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> There is a difference <b>between</b> their opinions with regard to the issue of whether <b>thirty days in a year are considered</b> equivalent to <b>a year.</b> Rabbi Meir maintains that thirty days in a year are considered equivalent to a year, and therefore a girl aged two years and thirty days is already considered like a three-year-old and may be betrothed through intercourse. By contrast, the Rabbis contend that thirty days in a year are not considered equivalent to a year, and she may be betrothed through intercourse only upon reaching the age of three years and one day.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against the explanation of Rabbi Yannai from a <i>baraita</i>: A girl who is <b>three years old, and even</b> one who is <b>two years and one day old, is betrothed through intercourse;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> She must be <b>three years and one day old.</b>

Daf 45a

The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, just as there is a <i>tanna</i> who says</b> that <b>one day in a year is considered</b> equivalent to <b>a year, so too, there is a <i>tanna</i> who says</b> that <b>thirty days in a year are considered</b> equivalent to <b>a year.</b>The <i>baraita</i> states that according to Rabbi Meir, a girl two years and one day old is considered like a three-year-old, following the opinion that one day in a year is equivalent to a full year. Similarly, Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that there is a second <i>tanna</i> who says that thirty days in a year are considered equivalent to a full year, and therefore a girl can be betrothed by intercourse from the age of two years and thirty days.
<b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yannai,</b> that Rabbi Meir requires a full three years, this <i>baraita</i> is <b>difficult,</b> as it explicitly states that in Rabbi Meir’s opinion even a girl aged two years and one day can be betrothed by intercourse. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, this <i>baraita</i> is <b>difficult</b> according to the opinion of Rabbi Yannai.
§ The last clause of the mishna teaches that if the girl is <b>less than that</b> age, i.e., younger than three years and one day, the status of intercourse with her is <b>like placing a finger into the eye. A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: What happens to <b>this hymen,</b> i.e., to the hymen of a girl under three with whom a man engaged in intercourse? Does it <b>disappear and come</b> back again later, <b>or perhaps it is not removed at all until after</b> she reaches the age of <b>three?</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What difference is</b> there in <i>halakha</i> between these two suggestions? The Gemara answers that there is a practical ramification in a case <b>where</b> a priest <b>engaged in intercourse</b> with a girl to whom he is married <b>within</b> her first <b>three</b> years, <b>and found blood</b> on her due to that intercourse, <b>and</b> again <b>engaged in intercourse</b> with her many times, including <b>after</b> she turned <b>three, but</b> on that occasion <b>he did not find blood. If you say</b> that after engaging in intercourse when the girl is younger than three, the hymen <b>disappears and comes</b> back again, here one can maintain that it disappeared due to the first time they engaged in intercourse and did not grow back because <b>there was not enough time</b> without intercourse <b>for it</b> to grow back.
<b>But if you say</b> that the hymen <b>is not removed</b> at all <b>until after</b> she reaches the age of <b>three,</b> the fact that <b>this</b> girl did not emit blood after three years must be because <b>another</b> man <b>engaged in intercourse with her</b> after she turned three, in which case she is classified as a <i>zona</i>, a woman who has engaged in sexual intercourse with a man forbidden to her by the Torah, and is forbidden to her husband the priest. The Gemara reiterates: <b>What,</b> then, is the resolution of the dilemma?
<b>Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rav Ika, objects to this</b> explanation of the practical ramifications of the dilemma: <b>But</b> even if one maintains that the hymen of a girl younger than three disappears and grows back, one can still contend that this girl engaged in intercourse with another man, as <b>who will say to us that a wound that</b> was inflicted <b>within three years</b> of a girl’s birth <b>is not restored</b> and healed <b>immediately? Perhaps it is restored immediately, and this</b> girl did not emit blood because <b>another</b> man <b>engaged in intercourse with her</b> previously, and she is therefore a <i>zona</i> who is forbidden to a priest.
<b>Rather,</b> the practical <b>difference</b> between the two suggestions relates to a case <b>where</b> the husband <b>engaged in intercourse</b> with this girl <b>within</b> her first <b>three</b> years, <b>and found blood, and engaged in intercourse</b> with her again <b>after</b> she turned <b>three, and</b> again <b>found blood. If you say</b> that the hymen <b>disappears and comes</b> back again, <b>this</b> blood emitted when she is less than three years old <b>is blood</b> from the tearing of <b>the hymen,</b> which does not render her impure. <b>But if you say</b> that the hymen <b>is not removed</b> at all <b>until after</b> she reaches the age of <b>three,</b> then <b>this</b> blood she emitted when she was younger than three <b>is menstrual blood,</b> which renders her impure. <b>What,</b> then, is the resolution of the dilemma?
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the mishna: If the girl is <b>less than that</b> age of three years and one day, intercourse with her is <b>like placing a finger into the eye. Why do I</b> need the mishna <b>to teach: Like placing a finger into the eye? Let</b> it <b>teach</b> simply: If she is <b>less than that</b> age, intercourse with her is <b>nothing. What, is it not</b> correct that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>teaches us,</b> by its comparison to an eye: <b>Just as</b> placing a finger in <b>an eye</b> causes it to <b>tear and tear again,</b> when another finger is placed in it, <b>so too</b> after the intercourse of a girl under three the <b>hymen disappears and comes</b> back again?
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving</b> a gentile woman called <b>Yusteni, the daughter of Asveirus, son of Antoninus,</b> a Roman emperor, <b>who came before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>She said to him: My teacher, at what</b> age is <b>a woman</b> fit to <b>marry,</b> i.e., at what age is it appropriate for a woman to engage in intercourse, which would therefore be the appropriate time to marry? Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to her:</b> She must be at least <b>three years and one day old.</b>
Yusteni further inquired: <b>And at what</b> age is <b>she</b> fit to <b>become pregnant?</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to her:</b> When she is at least <b>twelve years and one day old. She said to him: I married when</b> I was <b>six, and gave birth</b> a year later, <b>when</b> I was <b>seven. Woe for</b> those <b>three years,</b> between the age of three, when I was fit for intercourse, and the age of six, when I married, <b>as I wasted</b> those years <b>in my father’s house</b> by not engaging in intercourse.
The Gemara asks: <b>And can</b> a minor of that age <b>become pregnant? But didn’t Rav Beivai teach</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Naḥman: Three women</b> may <b>engage in intercourse</b> while <b>using</b> a contraceptive absorbent <b>cloth,</b> a soft fabric placed at the entrance to the womb to prevent conception, despite the fact that this practice generally is prohibited. They are <b>a minor; a pregnant woman; and a nursing woman.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> specifies the reason for allowing these women to use contraceptive absorbent cloths: <b>A minor, lest she become pregnant and</b> perhaps <b>die</b> from this pregnancy; <b>a pregnant woman, lest</b> she be impregnated a second time and <b>her</b> older <b>fetus become</b> deformed into the shape of <b>a sandal</b> fish, by being squashed by the pressure of the second fetus; and <b>a nursing woman, lest</b> she become pregnant and her milk dry up, in which case <b>she weans her son</b> too early, thereby endangering him, <b>and he dies.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And who is</b> considered <b>a minor?</b> It is a girl <b>from the age of eleven years and one day until</b> the age of <b>twelve years and one day.</b> If she was <b>younger than that or older than that, she may go ahead and engage in intercourse</b> in her usual manner, i.e., without contraception. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> Since it is assumed that a minor who is less than eleven years old cannot become pregnant, she is considered to be in no danger.
<b>And the Rabbis say: Both</b> in <b>this</b> case of a minor girl who can become pregnant <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case of a minor girl who cannot become pregnant, she <b>may go ahead and engage in intercourse in her usual manner, and Heaven will have mercy</b> upon her and prevent any mishap, <b>as it is stated: “The Lord preserves the simple”</b> (Psalms 116:6). In light of the statement of Rabbi Meir, how could Yusteni have become pregnant at age seven?
The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that Yusteni was able to become pregnant at such a young age because she was a gentile, and the verse states with regard to gentiles: <b>“Their flesh is the flesh of donkeys”</b> (Ezekiel 23:20). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that Yusteni was lying when she said she became pregnant at age seven, as it is stated with regard to gentiles: <b>“Whose mouth speaks falsehood, and their right hand is a right hand of lying”</b> (Psalms 144:8).
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving a certain woman who came before Rabbi Akiva</b> and <b>said to him: My teacher, I engaged in intercourse within three years</b> of my birth; <b>what</b> is <b>my</b> status with regard to marrying <b>into the priesthood?</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>said to her: You are fit</b> to marry <b>into the priesthood.</b>
<b>She said to him: My teacher, I will tell you a parable; to what is this matter comparable?</b> It is comparable <b>to a baby whose finger</b> one forcibly <b>dipped in honey.</b> On the <b>first time and</b> the <b>second</b> time, <b>he moans at</b> his mother for doing so, but on the <b>third</b> occasion, once he is used to the taste of honey, he willingly <b>sucks</b> the finger dipped in honey. She was insinuating to Rabbi Akiva that she engaged in intercourse several times, and although the first couple of times were against her will, the third incident was with her consent. Rabbi Akiva <b>said to her: If so, you are disqualified</b> from marrying <b>into the priesthood.</b>
Rabbi Akiva <b>saw</b> his <b>students looking at each other,</b> puzzling over this ruling. <b>He said to them: Why is this matter difficult in your eyes? They said to him: Just as the entire Torah is a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai, so too</b> this <i>halakha</i> of a girl who engaged in intercourse when she was <b>less than three years old,</b> i.e., that she is <b>fit</b> to marry <b>into the priesthood,</b> is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai,</b> and it applies whether she engaged intercourse against her will or with her consent. The Gemara notes: <b>And even Rabbi Akiva did not say</b> to the woman that she was unfit to marry into the priesthood because that is the <i>halakha</i>; rather, he did so <b>only to sharpen</b> the minds of his <b>students with</b> his statement, to see how they would respond.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of a boy, <b>nine years and one day old,</b> whose brother had died childless, <b>who engaged in intercourse with his <i>yevama</i>,</b> his brother’s widow, the status of the intercourse is that of halakhic intercourse and <b>he acquires her</b> as his wife; <b>but he cannot give</b> her <b>a bill of divorce,</b> if he chooses to end the marriage, <b>until he reaches majority.</b>
<b>And he becomes ritually impure</b> after engaging in intercourse <b>with a menstruating woman to</b> the degree that he <b>renders impure</b> all the layers of <b>bedding beneath</b> him, such that they become impure <b>like the upper</b> bedding covering a <i>zav</i>. Accordingly, the bedding assumes first-degree ritual impurity status and does not become a primary source of ritual impurity, and it renders impure food and drink and does not render impure people and vessels.
<b>And</b> if he is disqualified from the priesthood and the woman with whom he engages in intercourse is the daughter of a priest, <b>he disqualifies</b> her from partaking of <i>teruma</i>; <b>but</b> if he is a priest who marries an Israelite woman, <b>he does not enable</b> her <b>to partake of <i>teruma</i>. And</b> if he engages in bestiality, <b>he disqualifies the animal from</b> being sacrificed <b>upon the altar, and</b> the animal <b>is stoned due to his</b> act. <b>And if he engaged in intercourse with one of all those with whom relations are forbidden,</b> as <b>stated in the Torah,</b> e.g., his aunt or his mother, <b>they are executed</b> by the court <b>due to</b> having engaged in intercourse with <b>him,</b> because they are adults; <b>but he is exempt,</b> as he is a minor.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that a boy aged nine years and one day cannot give his <i>yevama</i> a bill of divorce until he reaches majority. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> even <b>when he reaches majority, is a bill of divorce enough to</b> enable <b>her</b> to marry any man? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the Sages <b>rendered the</b> halakhic status of the act of <b>intercourse of</b> a boy <b>nine</b> years and one day <b>old like</b> that of <b>levirate betrothal</b> by means of money or a document performed <b>by an adult man,</b> which is an acquisition by rabbinic law? Accordingly, she is not his full-fledged wife.
Therefore, one can assert as follows: <b>Just as</b> after <b>a levirate betrothal</b> performed <b>by an adult man,</b> the <i>yavam</i> <b>must</b> give the <i>yevama</i> <b>a bill of divorce to</b> release her from <b>his levirate betrothal and</b> perform <b><i>ḥalitza</i> to</b> release her from <b>his</b> levirate <b>bond, so too</b> with regard to <b>the intercourse of</b> a boy <b>nine</b> years and one day <b>old,</b> the <i>halakha</i> should be that he <b>must</b> give her <b>a bill of divorce for his levirate betrothal and</b> perform <b><i>ḥalitza</i> to</b> release her from <b>his</b> levirate <b>bond.</b>
<b>Rav said</b> in response that <b>this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>is saying:</b>

Daf 45b

<b>When he reaches majority he may engage in intercourse with her,</b> and thereby acquire her as his full-fledged wife, <b>and</b> if he wished to divorce her <b>he</b> can then <b>give her a bill of divorce</b> without having to perform <i>ḥalitza</i>.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to a girl who is <b>eleven years and one day old, her vows are examined</b> to ascertain whether she is aware of the meaning of her vow and in Whose name she vowed. Once she is <b>twelve years and one day old</b> and has grown two pubic hairs, which is a sign of adulthood, even without examination <b>her vows are in effect. And one examines</b> her vows throughout <b>the entire twelfth</b> year until her twelfth birthday.
With regard to a boy who is <b>twelve years and one day old, his vows are examined</b> to ascertain whether he is aware of the meaning of his vow and in Whose name he vowed. Once he is <b>thirteen years and one day old</b> and has grown two pubic hairs, even without examination <b>his vows are in effect. And one examines</b> his vows throughout <b>the entire thirteenth</b> year until his thirteenth birthday.
<b>Prior to that time,</b> eleven years and one day for a girl and twelve years and one day for a boy, <b>even if they said: We know in Whose name we vowed</b> and <b>in Whose name we consecrated, their vow is not</b> a valid <b>vow and their consecration is not</b> a valid <b>consecration. After that time,</b> twelve years and one day for a girl and thirteen years and one day for a boy, <b>even if they said: We do not know in Whose name we vowed</b> and <b>in Whose name we consecrated, their vow is</b> a valid <b>vow and their consecration is</b> a valid <b>consecration.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>But since</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> With regard to a girl who is <b>eleven years and one day old her vows are examined, why do I</b> need the mishna to further state: Once she is <b>twelve years and one day old her vows are in effect?</b> After all, by this stage she is already an adult. The Gemara answers that this ruling is necessary, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>one examines</b> her vows <b>forever,</b> even when she is an adult. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the vows of an adult are valid even without examination.
The Gemara further asks: <b>And since</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> Once she is <b>twelve years and one day old her vows are in effect, why do I</b> need it to further state: <b>One examines</b> her vows throughout <b>the entire twelfth</b> year? The Gemara answers that this ruling is necessary, as it might <b>enter your mind to say: Since the Master says</b> that <b>thirty days in a year are considered</b> equivalent to <b>a year,</b> in a case <b>where we examine her</b> for <b>thirty</b> days after she turned eleven <b>and she did not know</b> how <b>to utter</b> a vow <b>properly,</b> i.e., she did not have a clear understanding of the meaning of the vow, one might <b>say</b> that <b>one should examine</b> her <b>no further</b> until she reaches the age of twelve. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that she is examined throughout her twelfth year.
The Gemara asks: <b>And let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> only <b>these two clauses:</b> Once she is <b>twelve years and one day old her vows are in effect, and one examines</b> her vows throughout <b>the entire twelfth</b> year. Once both of these have been taught, <b>why do I</b> need the ruling: With regard to a girl who is <b>eleven years and one day old, her vows are examined?</b>
The Gemara answers that this clause <b>was necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say:</b> In <b>an ordinary</b> case, a girl <b>requires examination in</b> her <b>twelfth</b> year, whereas <b>in</b> her <b>eleventh</b> year she <b>does not require examination. But</b> in a case <b>where we discern about her that she</b> has <b>a very sharp</b> mind, perhaps <b>she should be examined</b> already <b>in</b> her <b>eleventh</b> year. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that she is not examined in her eleventh year irrespective of how intelligent she is, as she is too young.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the mishna to teach that <b>prior to that time</b> their vows and consecration are always not valid <b>and after that time</b> they are always valid? These <i>halakhot</i> can be inferred from the previous statements of the mishna. The Gemara answers that these rulings are necessary, as it might <b>enter your mind to say: These matters</b> apply only in a case <b>where they do not say:</b> We know in Whose name we vowed, when they are younger than the periods mentioned in the mishna, or: We do not know in Whose name we vowed, when they are older. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where they do say</b> such statements, perhaps <b>we rely on their</b> claim. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that when they are younger than the periods stated in the mishna their vows are never valid, and when they are older, their vows are always valid.
§ The mishna indicates that the intellectual development of a girl is faster than that of a boy. In this regard, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>This</b> opinion, with regard to the periods of vows for girls and boys, is in accordance with <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. But <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says</b> the opposite, that the <b>matter stated</b> here <b>with regard to a girl is</b> actually <b>stated with regard to a boy,</b> whereas the <b>matter stated with regard to a boy is</b> in fact <b>stated with regard to a girl,</b> as the intellectual development of males is faster than that of females.
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: What is the reason of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>As it is written,</b> with regard to the creation of woman: <b>“And the rib,</b> which <b>the Lord God</b> had taken from the man, <b>He made [<i>vayyiven</i>]</b> a woman, and brought her to the man” (Genesis 2:22). This <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, granted a woman a greater understanding [<i>bina</i>] than</b> that <b>of a men.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, derive from this verse? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires that</b> verse <b>for that which Reish Lakish</b> taught, <b>as Reish Lakish said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from the man, He made a woman, and brought her to the man.”</b> This <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, braided</b> the hair of <b>Eve, and</b> then <b>brought her to Adam the first</b> man. <b>As in the cities overseas [<i>bikhrakei hayyam</i>] they call braiding</b> hair, <b>building [<i>benayita</i>].</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, what is the reason</b> that he maintains that the intellectual development of males is faster than that of females? <b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says: Since a boy frequents his teacher’s house, cleverness enters his</b> mind <b>first.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that there are three periods in the development of girls and boys: When their vows are examined, i.e., the twelfth year for a girl and the thirteenth year for a boy, which will be termed below: During the time; the period beforehand, when their vows are entirely invalid, called: Before the time; and after that period, when their vows are always valid, known as: After the time. But the mishna does not address the issue of their physical development during these periods, with regard to the appearance of two pubic hairs. In this regard, <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If a boy or girl developed pubic hairs <b>during</b> the <b>time,</b> is this year considered <b>like</b> the development of signs indicating puberty <b>before</b> the <b>time</b> that the child reaches majority, and therefore they are not treated as signs indicating puberty, <b>or</b> is it considered <b>as after</b> the <b>time?</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is this dilemma raised? <b>If</b> it is <b>with regard to vows,</b> the development of pubic hairs <b>is not considered as before</b> the <b>time, but</b> it <b>is not considered as after</b> the <b>time</b> either. Instead, the status of the vow is determined in accordance with the examination of the child’s understanding, as stated in the mishna.
<b>Rather,</b> the dilemma is raised <b>with regard to punishments,</b> i.e., whether such a boy or girl is punished like an adult for violating the prohibitions of the Torah. <b>What,</b> then, is the <i>halakha</i>? The Sages disagree. <b>Rav and Rabbi Ḥanina both say:</b> The development of pubic hairs <b>during</b> that <b>time</b> is considered <b>as before</b> the <b>time,</b> and therefore the boy or girl is not liable to receive punishment for his or her actions. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi both say:</b> The development of pubic hairs <b>during</b> that <b>time</b> is considered <b>as after</b> the <b>time,</b> and they are punished.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: And your mnemonic,</b> to remember which Sages said which ruling, is the verse: <b>“Now this [<i>vezot</i>] was the custom in former times in Israel”</b> (Ruth 4:7). The Sage whose name has a feminine form like the word <i>vezot</i>, namely, Rav Ḥanina, maintains that the development of pubic hairs during the time is considered as before the time, like the former times mentioned in the verse.
<b>Rav Hamnuna raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi from the mishna: <b>After that time,</b> twelve years and one day for a girl and thirteen years and one day for a boy, <b>even if they say: We do not know in Whose name we vowed</b> and <b>in Whose name we consecrated, their vow is</b> a valid <b>vow and their consecration is</b> a valid <b>consecration.</b> Rav Hamnuna infers from this ruling that if they issued this statement <b>during</b> the <b>time,</b> it is considered <b>as before</b> the <b>time,</b> even if they had developed two hairs.
<b>Rava said to</b> Rav Hamnuna, in rejection of this proof: <b>Say the former clause</b> in the mishna: <b>Prior to that time,</b> eleven years and one day for a girl and twelve years and one day for a boy, <b>even if they said: We know in Whose name we vowed</b> and <b>in Whose name we consecrated, their vow is not</b> a valid <b>vow and their consecration is not</b> a valid <b>consecration.</b> One can infer the opposite from here, that if they issued this statement <b>during</b> the <b>time,</b> it is considered <b>as after</b> the <b>time.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>And</b> that <b>is not so,</b> as <b>Rava erred. He thought</b> that <b>Rav Hamnuna inferred from the superfluous</b> statement of the <b>mishna,</b> i.e., that the clause Rav Hamnuna cites is unnecessary for the <i>halakha</i> it states, which is why Rav Hamnuna inferred his conclusion from it. <b>And</b> therefore Rava responded that <b>rather than inferring from the latter clause</b> of the mishna that if the boy or girl claims not to know in Whose name he or she vowed during the time, it is considered as before the time, <b>let him infer from the former clause</b> that it is considered as after the time, as Rava demonstrated.
The Gemara continues: <b>But it is not so;</b> rather, <b>Rav Hamnuna inferred</b> that it is considered as before the time <b>from the</b> statement of <b>the mishna itself,</b> without assuming that it is superfluous, as follows: In <b>that</b> mention in the mishna of: <b>After</b> that <b>time, what are the circumstances? If</b> it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the boy <b>has not</b> yet <b>developed two</b> pubic <b>hairs, he is a minor. Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> the boy <b>has developed two</b> pubic <b>hairs,</b>

Daf 46a

<b>and the reason</b> that the development of two hairs renders him an adult is <b>that</b> the onset of <b>his matter,</b> i.e., his reaching puberty, <b>was completed for him after</b> the <b>time?</b> Rav Hamnuna infers from here that if the child developed two hairs <b>during</b> the <b>time,</b> it is considered <b>as before</b> the <b>time,</b> and he or she is not classified as an adult.
<b>And furthermore, Rabbi Zeira raises an objection</b> to the opinion that the development of signs indicating puberty during the time is equivalent to their development after the time. It is taught in a <i>baraita</i> which deals with the verse: “Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: <b>When</b> either <b>man</b> or a woman <b>shall clearly utter a vow”</b> (Numbers 6:2). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “man,”</b> after it has already stated “the children of Israel”? This serves <b>to include</b> anyone who is <b>thirteen years and one day old, that even if he does not know</b> how <b>to utter clearly</b> and articulate the meaning of his statements, <b>his vows are in effect.</b>
Rabbi Zeira analyzes this <i>baraita</i>. <b>What are the circumstances? If</b> it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the boy <b>has not</b> yet <b>developed two</b> pubic <b>hairs,</b> then <b>he is a minor,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> with regard to him cannot be derived from the word “man.” <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> the boy <b>has developed two</b> pubic <b>hairs? And</b> by inference, <b>the reason that he is</b> considered <b>a man</b> due to his development of pubic hairs <b>is that he is thirteen years and one day old, but</b> if the boy developed two hairs <b>during</b> the <b>time,</b> it is considered <b>as before</b> the <b>time.</b> The Gemara concludes: This is indeed <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi that developing pubic hairs during the time is equivalent to developing hairs after the time.
<b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is not a refutation of the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, as this matter is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> since there is another <i>baraita</i> which teaches the following: Everyone agrees with regard to <b>a nine-year-old</b> boy <b>who developed two hairs</b> that this is not considered a sign of puberty, as they are treated as hairs that grow on <b>a mole. From nine</b> years <b>of age until</b> the age of <b>twelve years and one day,</b> even if the hairs have not fallen out, this is still considered <b>a mole. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> At this stage it is <b>a sign</b> indicating puberty. If he is <b>thirteen years and one day old</b> and has grown two hairs, <b>all agree</b> that it is <b>a sign</b> indicating puberty.
Rav Naḥman analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>itself</b> is <b>difficult,</b> as <b>you</b> initially <b>said</b> that <b>from nine</b> years <b>of age until</b> the age of <b>twelve years and one day</b> it is <b>a mole,</b> from which it can be inferred that if he developed two pubic hairs in <b>the thirteenth year itself,</b> it is <b>a sign</b> indicating puberty. <b>And then</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that if he is <b>thirteen years and one day old</b> and has grown two hairs, this is <b>a sign</b> indicating puberty, which indicates that if he developed the hairs in <b>the thirteenth year itself,</b> it is <b>a mole.</b>
Rav Naḥman concludes: <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that there <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> who states the first line of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that <b>during</b> that <b>time</b> is considered <b>as after</b> the <b>time, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the last line of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that <b>during</b> that <b>time</b> is considered <b>as before</b> the <b>time?</b> If so, the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi is one side of a dispute between <i>tanna’im</i>.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No, everyone,</b> i.e., the <i>tanna’im</i> of both clauses of the <i>baraita</i>, agrees that <b>during</b> that <b>time</b> is considered <b>as before</b> the <b>time, and this</b> clause <b>and that</b> clause of the <i>baraita</i> are both referring <b>to a young girl. And</b> the difference between them is that <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who maintains that the thirteenth year for a female is considered after the time, and therefore the development of two pubic hairs at this stage is a sign of maturation; <b>and the last clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar,</b> who holds that the thirteenth year for a female is considered before the time.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>this</b> clause <b>and that</b> clause are both dealing <b>with a young boy, and the first clause</b> is in accordance with <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar and the last clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who maintains that the thirteenth year for a boy is considered before the time.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> that both <b>this</b> clause <b>and that</b> clause are in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, and the difference between them is that <b>this</b> last clause of the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a young boy,</b> whereas <b>that</b> first clause is referring <b>to a young girl. And if you wish, say</b> that both <b>this</b> clause <b>and that</b> clause are in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar,</b> and <b>that</b> first clause of the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a young boy,</b> whereas <b>this</b> last clause is referring <b>to a young girl.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> further teaches that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says</b> with regard to hairs from nine years of age until the age of twelve years and one day, that it is <b>a sign</b> indicating puberty. In explanation of this opinion, <b>Rabbi Keruspedai, son of Rabbi Shabbtai, says: And</b> this <b>is</b> the <i>halakha</i> only <b>when</b> the hairs <b>are still upon him,</b> i.e., they had not fallen out when he reached the age of puberty, as otherwise they are considered a mole.
The Gemara notes that <b>this</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a boy <b>nine years and one day old who developed two hairs,</b> this is considered <b>a mole.</b> If the boy is <b>from nine</b> years <b>of age until</b> the age of <b>twelve years and one day, and</b> the hairs <b>are still upon him,</b> it is still considered <b>a mole. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> It is <b>a sign</b> indicating puberty.
§ In summary of the rulings cited above, <b>Rava said: The <i>halakha</i></b> is that the development of two hairs <b>during</b> the <b>time</b> is considered <b>as before</b> the <b>time,</b> and it does not render one an adult. <b>Rav Shmuel bar Zutra teaches this <i>halakha</i> of Rava in this formulation: Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>a minor girl</b> whose father has passed away and whose mother or brothers accepted betrothal on her behalf, a form of betrothal instituted by the Sages, throughout her <b>entire twelfth year she</b> has the <b>continuous</b> right to <b>perform refusal with regard to</b> this marriage and thereby annul it. <b>From that</b> point <b>forward,</b> when she is already an adult, <b>she may no</b> longer <b>perform refusal, and she may not perform <i>ḥalitza</i></b> with the brother of her husband, if he died without children.
The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> statement of Rava <b>itself</b> is <b>difficult: You</b> first <b>said</b> that once she is twelve <b>she may not perform refusal. Evidently, she is an adult woman.</b> But <b>if she is an adult woman, let her perform <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> like any other adult woman.
<b>And if you would say</b> that Rava <b>is uncertain</b> whether a twelve-year-old girl is presumed to have developed two hairs and is therefore an adult, or whether it is presumed that she has not yet grown two hairs and remains a minor, and consequently he is stringent on both counts, that she may not perform refusal, like an adult, but she may also not perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, like a minor, this suggestion is problematic, as <b>is</b> Rava actually <b>uncertain</b> in this regard? <b>But doesn’t Rava say: A minor girl who reached her full age</b> of maturity, i.e., twelve years and one day, <b>does not require examination</b> to determine whether she has grown two hairs, as there is <b>a presumption</b> that <b>she has developed signs</b> indicating puberty.
The Gemara answers that <b>this statement,</b> that it is presumed that a twelve-year-old girl has developed two hairs, applies only <b>in an ordinary</b> situation. <b>But here</b> Rava is referring to a case <b>where they examined</b> her <b>and did not find</b> hairs. In such an instance, Rava did <b>not</b> say that the presumption is in effect.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that she was actually examined, she should be considered a minor in all regards and <b>she should</b> be able to <b>perform refusal.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>We are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the girl had already developed pubic hairs but <b>they fell out.</b> Consequently, although the girl is not treated with the presumption that she is an adult, she does not have the certain status of a minor either, and cannot perform refusal.
The Gemara objects: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that <b>we are concerned</b> that the pubic hairs fell out. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that <b>we are not concerned</b> that they have fallen out, <b>what is there to say? As it was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to this matter. <b>Rav Pappa says: We are not concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the pubic hairs <b>fell out; Rav Pappi says: We are concerned</b> that they might have fallen out. The Gemara answers that <b>this statement</b> of Rav Pappa, that there is no concern that perhaps the pubic hairs fell out, applies only <b>with regard to <i>ḥalitza</i>, but with regard to refusal</b> everyone agrees that <b>we are concerned</b> that they might have fallen out.
The Gemara asks: <b>By inference, does the one who says</b> that <b>we are concerned</b> that perhaps the hairs fell out maintain that this twelve-year-old <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i>? But</b> this cannot be correct, as <b>he says</b> that <b>we are merely concerned</b> that the hairs might have fallen out, not that this is certainly the case. How, then, can she perform <i>ḥalitza</i> like an adult?
<b>Rather,</b> Rava is <b>actually</b> referring to a case <b>where one did not examine</b> the girl, <b>and with regard to <i>ḥalitza</i> we are concerned</b> that she might not have developed hairs and is still a minor. <b>And when Rava said</b> that there is <b>a presumption</b> that a twelve-year-old has developed signs indicating puberty, he was referring <b>to refusal, but with regard to <i>ḥalitza</i> she requires examination.</b>
With regard to the issue of whether there is concern that hairs might have fallen out, <b>Rav Dimi of Neharde’a said: The <i>halakha</i></b> is that if a girl reached the age of twelve and she was examined and the signs of puberty were not found, <b>we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the pubic hairs <b>fell out.</b> Consequently, if her mother or brothers had accepted betrothal for her when she was a minor, she cannot perform refusal at that stage.
The Gemara adds: <b>And this statement</b> applies only in a case <b>where</b> her husband <b>betrothed her during</b> the <b>time,</b> before she reached the age of twelve years and one day, <b>and engaged in intercourse</b> with her <b>after</b> the <b>time,</b> when she was already twelve years and one day old. This is a situation <b>where there is an uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>Torah law,</b> since if she had developed two hairs and is an adult, the marriage applies by Torah law, due to the intercourse. <b>But</b> if he engaged in intercourse with her only <b>at the outset,</b> before she turned twelve, there is <b>no</b> concern that perhaps she developed pubic hairs and they fell out, as this marriage applies by rabbinic law.
§ With regard to a minor who vowed, <b>Rav Huna says:</b> If the minor is aware of the meaning of his vow and in Whose name he or she vowed, and the minor’s age is during the time, i.e., the twelfth year for a girl or the thirteenth year for a boy, and he <b>consecrated</b> an item of food <b>and</b> subsequently <b>ate</b> it, <b>he is flogged,</b> which is the punishment for one who eats consecrated food.
Rav Huna explains: <b>As it is stated: “When</b> either <b>a man</b> or a woman <b>shall clearly utter a vow”</b> (Numbers 6:2), from which it is derived that if one on the brink of adulthood is able to articulate that his vow is in the name of God, his vows are valid. <b>And</b> another verse states: <b>“He shall not profane his word”</b> (Numbers 30:3). This indicates that <b>any</b> person <b>who is</b> included <b>in explicitness</b> of intent <b>is</b> also included <b>in</b> the prohibition: <b>“He shall not profane</b> his word,” <b>and anyone who is not</b> included <b>in explicitness</b> of intent <b>is not</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition: <b>“He shall not profane</b> his word.”
<b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda raises an objection</b> to Rava, <b>in support</b> of the opinion <b>of Rav Huna:</b>

Daf 46b

<b>Since we find that the verse equates a minor,</b> i.e., one on the brink of adulthood, <b>to an adult with regard to an intentional</b> violation of <b>an oath and with regard to</b> a vow of <b>prohibition,</b> where one renders an item prohibited to himself through a vow, <b>and with regard to</b> the prohibition of <b>he shall not profane</b> his word, one <b>might</b> have thought that this minor, like an adult, <b>should</b> also <b>be liable</b> to bring <b>an offering for</b> misuse of <b>his consecrated</b> property, e.g., if he ate an item that he consecrated.
Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to vows: <b>“This is the matter</b> which the Lord has commanded. When a man vows a vow to the Lord, or takes an oath” (Numbers 30:2–3). The emphasis of “this” indicates that it is only with regard to this matter, i.e., prohibitions resulting from vows, that a discriminating minor on the brink of adulthood is considered an adult, but he is not rendered liable to bring an offering for his misuse.
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that a discriminating minor on the brink of adulthood is considered an adult <b>with regard to</b> a vow of <b>prohibition and with regard to</b> the prohibition of <b>he shall not profane</b> his word, which indicates that he is <b>liable</b> for violating this prohibition. This supports the opinion of Rav Huna that a minor is flogged for eating food he consecrated. The Gemara refutes this proof: There is room to <b>say</b> that the word: And, in the phrase: With regard to a vow of prohibition and with regard to the prohibition of he shall not profane his word, should be omitted, and the <i>baraita</i> is comparing a minor to an adult <b>with regard to the prohibition</b> of <b>he shall not profane</b> his word, but it does not indicate that he is liable to receive lashes for violating this prohibition.
The Gemara asks: Can the <i>baraita</i> actually mean that a minor is compared to an adult with regard to <b>the prohibition</b> of <b>he shall not profane</b> his word, but he is not flogged? <b>Whichever way you</b> look at it, this is problematic: <b>If a discriminating</b> minor <b>on the brink of adulthood</b> is considered an adult <b>by Torah law, he should be flogged too,</b> for his violation. <b>And if a discriminating</b> minor <b>on the brink of adulthood</b> is <b>not</b> considered an adult <b>by Torah law, there is no prohibition</b> violated here <b>either.</b> The Gemara answers that according to the <i>baraita</i> the prohibition does not apply to the minor himself, but <b>to those who are warned to</b> keep <b>him</b> away from the prohibited item.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: If so, one can <b>conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that if <b>a minor eats</b> meat from unslaughtered <b>animal carcasses</b> or violates other prohibitions, <b>the court is commanded to prevent him</b> from doing so. This is problematic, as elsewhere it is stated that this matter is subject to dispute (see <i>Yevamot</i> 114a). The Gemara explains: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the minor <b>consecrated</b> the food item <b>and others ate</b> it. They are liable to receive lashes for their consumption, but if he ate it he is not liable.
The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>This works out well according to the one who said</b> that if a minor <b>consecrated</b> a food item <b>and others ate</b> it, <b>they are flogged. But according to the one who said</b> that in such a case <b>they are not flogged, what can be said? As it was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to this issue: If a minor <b>consecrated</b> a food item <b>and others ate</b> it, <b>Rav Kahana says</b> that <b>they are not flogged; Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish both say</b> that <b>they are flogged.</b>
The Gemara therefore reverts to the interpretation that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to the prohibition of he shall not profane his word, not the punishment for violation of the vow. And the reason lashes are not administered is that the prohibition is <b>by rabbinic law. And</b> as for the <b>verse</b> mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>, when it states that the verse equates a minor to an adult, which indicates that it is dealing with Torah law, this verse is <b>a mere support</b> for a rabbinic law.
§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself,</b> i.e., the dispute cited above. If a minor <b>consecrated</b> a food item <b>and others ate</b> it, <b>Rav Kahana says</b> that <b>they are not flogged; Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish both say</b> that <b>they are flogged. With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> these Sages <b>disagree?</b> One <b>Sage,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, <b>holds</b> that <b>a discriminating</b> minor <b>on the brink of adulthood</b> is considered an adult <b>by Torah law,</b> which is why others are liable for eating an item he consecrated; <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav Kahana, <b>holds</b> that <b>a discriminating</b> minor <b>on the brink of adulthood</b> is considered an adult <b>by rabbinic law.</b>
<b>Rav Yirmeya raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a minor girl who is <b>an orphan</b> from her father and her mother or brothers accepted betrothal on her behalf, <b>who vowed, her husband may nullify her</b> vow, like any other husband, despite the fact that this marriage is valid merely by rabbinic law. Rav Yirmeya analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>a discriminating</b> minor <b>on the brink of adulthood</b> is considered an adult <b>by rabbinic law,</b> one can explain that a husband whose <b>marriage</b> is <b>by rabbinic law comes and negates a vow</b> that also applies <b>by rabbinic law. But if you say</b> that a discriminating minor on the brink of adulthood is considered an adult <b>by Torah law,</b> can a husband whose <b>marriage</b> is <b>by rabbinic law come and negate a vow</b> that applies <b>by Torah law?</b>
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Her husband may nullify her</b> vows, <b>whichever</b> way <b>you</b> look at it: <b>If</b> the validity of the vows of such a minor applies <b>by rabbinic law,</b> the husband may nullify her vows, as the validity of their marriage <b>is</b> likewise <b>by rabbinic law.</b> And <b>if</b> the validity of a vow by a discriminating minor on the brink of adulthood is <b>by Torah law,</b> which means she would be violating a Torah prohibition, this <b>is</b> the same as the case of <b>a minor</b> who <b>may eat</b> meat from unslaughtered <b>animal carcasses</b> or violate other prohibitions, <b>and the court</b> or any other adult, including her husband in this case, <b>is not commanded to prevent him</b> from doing so,and it does not matter if his nullification was not effective.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> there is still concern for a violation, as <b>when she grows</b> and becomes an adult <b>she will eat</b> the food that she rendered forbidden to herself, relying <b>on the initial nullification</b> of her vow by her husband, which was not valid. At that stage she is an adult, whom the court is certainly commanded to prevent from violating prohibitions.
<b>Rabba bar Livai said</b> that this is not a concern, as <b>her husband nullifies her</b> vows <b>each and every moment,</b> and therefore when she reaches majority he will nullify her vow in a manner that is valid by Torah law. <b>And</b> this <b>is</b> the <i>halakha</i>, that the nullification takes effect by Torah law, only in a case <b>where</b> her husband <b>engaged in intercourse</b> with her after she became an adult, thereby rendering their marriage valid by Torah law.
The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>But</b> there is a principle that <b>a husband cannot nullify</b> vows of his wife that <b>preceded</b> their marriage; and as she is considered his wife by Torah law only when she becomes an adult, her vow when she was a minor preceded their marriage. The Gemara answers that he can still nullify her vow, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Pineḥas in the name of Rava, as Rav Pineḥas said in the name of Rava: Any</b> woman <b>who takes a vow,</b> it is from the outset contingent <b>on her husband’s consent</b> that <b>she takes the vow.</b> Since the minor was married by rabbinic law, she vowed on the condition that her husband should agree to her vow, and therefore the nullification is valid by Torah law.
§ The Gemara continues to discuss the validity of the vows of a discriminating minor on the brink of adulthood. <b>Abaye said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 1:3): With regard to <b>a minor who has not grown two hairs, Rabbi Yehuda says: His <i>teruma</i> is not</b> valid <b><i>teruma</i>. Rabbi Yosei says: Until he has reached the age of vows,</b> i.e., when he does not yet have the status of a discriminating minor on the brink of adulthood, <b>his <i>teruma</i> is not</b> valid <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> but <b>once he has reached the age of vows, his <i>teruma</i> is <i>teruma</i>.</b>
The Sages <b>assumed</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that <b><i>teruma</i> in the present</b> applies <b>by Torah law.</b> They therefore objected: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>a discriminating</b> minor <b>on the brink of adulthood</b> is an adult <b>by Torah law,</b> one can understand that one who is <b>a man by Torah law</b> with regard to vows <b>can come and prepare untithed produce [<i>tivla</i>]</b> for consumption by tithing it, which also applies <b>by Torah law. But if you say</b> that a discriminating minor on the brink of adulthood is an adult <b>by rabbinic law,</b> can one who is <b>a man by rabbinic law come and prepare untithed produce,</b> which is prohibited <b>by Torah law?</b> The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>No,</b> perhaps <b>Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that <b><i>teruma</i> in the present</b> applies <b>by rabbinic law,</b> and this is why he rules that a minor on the brink of adulthood can set aside <i>teruma</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Yosei hold</b> that <b><i>teruma</i> in the present</b> applies <b>by rabbinic law? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in</b> the anthology called <b><i>Seder Olam</i>:</b> The verse that states with regard to the Jewish people’s return to Eretz Yisrael following their exile: “And the Lord your God will bring you into the land <b>that your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:5).
These two expressions of possession indicate that the Jewish people had <b>a first possession</b> of Eretz Yisrael in the days of Joshua, when Eretz Yisrael was first sanctified with regard to the obligation of its mitzvot, <b>and they had a second</b> possession at the time of Ezra and the return of the Babylonian exile. In other words, the sanctity of the land lapsed when the First Temple was destroyed and the Jews were exiled to Babylonia, and therefore a second sanctification was necessary when they returned to their land. But <b>they</b> will <b>not have a third</b> possession. That is, it will never be necessary to sanctify the land a third time, as the second sanctification was permanent.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> that <b>taught <i>Seder Olam</i>? Rabbi Yosei.</b> Since Rabbi Yosei maintains that the second sanctification of Eretz Yisrael did not lapse even after the destruction of the Second Temple, he must also maintain that <i>teruma</i> in the present applies by Torah law.
The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Yosei taught</b> <i>Seder Olam</i> <b>but he does not maintain</b> in accordance with <b>its</b> ruling here. The Gemara adds: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> that this is so, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to non-sacred <b>dough that became mixed</b> with <i>teruma</i> dough, <b>or which was leavened with leaven of <i>teruma</i>,</b>

Daf 47a

it is <b>subject to the obligation</b> of separating <b><i>ḥalla</i>,</b> the portion of the dough designated for the priest. <b>And</b> although <i>teruma</i> fell into it, that produce does not have the status of <i>teruma</i>, as the <i>teruma</i> was nullified by a majority of non-sacred produce. Consequently, <b>it is not rendered unfit</b> for consumption, i.e., rendered ritually impure, <b>by one</b> who was ritually impure <b>who immersed that day</b> and is waiting for nightfall for his purification process to be completed. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon deem</b> the dough <b>exempt from the</b> obligation of separating <b><i>ḥalla</i>,</b> as this obligation does not apply to <i>teruma</i>, and the entire dough is exempt due to the mixture of <i>teruma</i> it contains.
The Sages <b>assumed</b> that <b>the one who said</b> that <b><i>teruma</i></b> in the present applies <b>by Torah law</b> maintains that <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> likewise applies in the present <b>by Torah law,</b> whereas <b>the one who said</b> that <b><i>teruma</i></b> in the present applies <b>by rabbinic law</b> holds that <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> also applies <b>by rabbinic law.</b> If so, <b>granted, if you say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that <b><i>ḥalla</i> in the present</b> applies <b>by rabbinic law,</b> one can understand that <b>a mixture</b> which has the status of <i>teruma</i> <b>by rabbinic law comes and abrogates</b> the obligation of separating <b><i>ḥalla</i>,</b> which also applies <b>by rabbinic law.</b>
<b>But if you say</b> that <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> in the present applies <b>by Torah law,</b> can <b>a mixture</b> that has the status of <i>teruma</i> <b>by rabbinic law come and abrogate</b> the mitzva of <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> which is <b>by Torah law?</b> Evidently, according to Rabbi Yosei the obligation of separating <i>ḥalla</i> in the present is by rabbinic law, and therefore <i>teruma</i> likewise applies by rabbinic law. If so, Rabbi Yosei does not agree with the opinion he cites in <i>Seder Olam</i>, according to which <i>teruma</i> applies in the present by Torah law.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>But perhaps Rabbi Yosei maintains</b> that <b><i>teruma</i> in the present</b> applies <b>by Torah law and</b> yet <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> applies <b>by rabbinic law,</b> and therefore the mixture discussed in the above <i>baraita</i>, which has the status of <i>teruma</i> by Torah law, abrogates the obligation of <i>ḥalla</i>, which is by rabbinic law.
The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> this answer is <b>as Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, responded</b> to the statement of the other Sages. <b>As Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: I</b> once <b>found the Sages of the study hall of Rav sitting and saying: Even according to the one who said</b> that <b><i>teruma</i> in the present</b> applies <b>by rabbinic law,</b> the obligation to separate <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> is <b>by Torah law.</b>
The reason is <b>that</b> during the <b>seven</b> years <b>that</b> the Jewish people <b>conquered</b> Eretz Yisrael led by Joshua <b>and</b> during the <b>seven</b> years <b>that they divided</b> the land, <b>they were obligated to</b> separate <b><i>ḥalla</i> but they were not obligated to</b> separate <i>teruma</i> and <b>tithe.</b> In the present as well, although there is no obligation to set aside <i>teruma</i> in Eretz Yisrael by Torah law, the obligation to separate <i>ḥalla</i> applies by Torah law.
Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, continued: <b>And I said to them:</b> On the contrary, <b>even according to the one who said</b> that <b><i>teruma</i> in the present</b> applies <b>by Torah law,</b> the obligation to separate <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> applies <b>by rabbinic law, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>: “When you come into the land where I bring you…from the first of your dough you shall set apart a cake for a gift” (Numbers 15:18–20). <b>If</b> the obligation applies <b>“when you come”</b> into the land, one <b>might</b> have thought that it took effect <b>from</b> the moment <b>that two or three spies entered</b> the land. Therefore <b>the verse states: “When you come,”</b> from which it is derived that the Torah is saying: <b>I said</b> that the obligation applies <b>when all of you come, and not when some of you come.</b>
According to this <i>baraita</i>, the separation of <i>ḥalla</i> is an obligation by Torah law only when the entire Jewish people come to Eretz Yisrael. <b>And when Ezra brought</b> the Jewish people to Eretz Yisrael at the beginning of the Second Temple period, <b>not all of them ascended.</b> Since the majority of the Jewish people stayed behind, separating <i>ḥalla</i> was not restored to the status of an obligation by Torah law.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The Sages stated a parable</b> based on the development of the fruit of a fig tree with regard to the three stages of development <b>in a woman:</b> Minority, young womanhood, and grown womanhood. <b>An unripe fig, a ripening fig, and a ripe fig. An unripe fig</b> represents the stage when <b>she is still a child</b> and has not yet developed the signs of puberty; <b>a ripening fig</b> represents <b>the days of her young womanhood,</b> when she reaches twelve years and one day and has developed two pubic hairs.
With regard to the periods both <b>during this</b> stage, minority, <b>and during that</b> stage, young womanhood, the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>her father is entitled to</b> any lost object that <b>she finds</b> that cannot be returned to its owner, <b>and to her earnings, and to nullification of her vows. A ripe fig</b> represents the stage of grown womanhood: <b>Once she has reached her majority, her father no longer has authority over her.</b> He can no longer nullify her vows, and he does not have a claim to lost objects found by her and her earnings belong to her.
<b>What are the signs</b> that indicate grown womanhood? <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says:</b> Grown womanhood begins <b>from when</b> her breast <b>grows</b> sufficiently so that <b>a fold</b> appears <b>below the breast. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> It begins <b>from when the breasts sag</b> onto the chest. <b>Ben Azzai says:</b> It begins <b>from when the areola</b> at the tip of the breast <b>darkens. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> It begins when the breasts have developed to <b>a size where</b> a person <b>places his hand on the nipple and it depresses and slows to return.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that <b>an unripe fig [<i>paga</i>]</b> represents the stage when a woman <b>is still a child.</b> The Gemara explains that the meaning of the word <i>paga</i> is <b>as it is written: “The fig tree puts forth her green fruits [<i>fageha</i>]”</b> (Song of Songs 2:13). The mishna further teaches that <b>a ripening fig [<i>boḥal</i>]</b> represents <b>the days of her young womanhood.</b> The Gemara explains that the meaning of this word is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ma’asrot</i> 1:2): The obligation of tithes applies to <b>the figs from when they begin to ripen [<i>misheyyibaḥalu</i>]; and Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rav says</b> that this means <b>from when the heads</b> of the figs <b>whiten.</b>
The Gemara adds: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the source is <b>from here: “For My soul became impatient of them, and their soul also grew in disgust [<i>baḥala</i>] toward Me”</b> (Zechariah 11:8). The verse indicates that this word denotes growth. As for the third term in the mishna, <b>a ripe fig [<i>tzemel</i>],</b> it is <b>as one would say:</b> A fruit <b>has come forth complete [<i>yatzeta mele’a</i>].</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And what are the signs</b> that indicate grown womanhood? <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says:</b> Grown womanhood begins <b>from when</b> her breast <b>grows</b> sufficiently so that <b>a fold</b> appears below the breast. <b>Shmuel says:</b> This does <b>not literally</b> mean <b>from when</b> her breast <b>grows</b> sufficiently so that a permanent <b>fold</b> appears below the breast. <b>Rather,</b> it means that the breast has grown enough <b>so that</b> if she were to <b>stretch her hand behind her</b> back, <b>it would appear as though</b> her breast has <b>grown</b> sufficiently that there is <b>a fold below the breast.</b>
The Gemara relates that <b>Shmuel examined</b> these stages <b>in his</b> Canaanite <b>maidservant, and</b> subsequently <b>gave her four dinars</b> as <b>payment for her humiliation.</b> The Gemara notes that in this regard <b>Shmuel</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as Shmuel said</b> that the verse: <b>“You may enslave them forever”</b> (Leviticus 25:46) teaches: <b>I gave them</b> to you <b>for</b> the <b>service</b> of slaves, <b>but not for humiliation.</b> Consequently, if a master humiliated his Canaanite slave, he must pay him damages.
The Gemara further relates, with regard to the attitude toward maidservants, that <b>Shmuel</b> would <b>designate</b> a particular slave <b>for</b> each of his maidservants for intercourse, and he would not allow his slaves to engage in intercourse with whichever maidservant they chose. By contrast, <b>Rav Naḥman</b> would <b>exchange</b> his maidservants between his slaves, while <b>Rav Sheshet handed</b> his maidservants <b>to an Arab, and said to them:</b> You may engage in intercourse with whomever you choose, but <b>take care</b> not to engage in intercourse <b>with a Jew.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> Grown womanhood begins when the breasts have developed to a size where if a person places his hand on the nipple [<i>oketz</i>] it depresses and slows to return. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>oketz</i>? Shmuel said:</b> It means <b>the protrusion [<i>oketz</i>] of the breast,</b> i.e., the nipple.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What are the signs of maturity? Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: From when the breasts knock against each other,</b> due to their size. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka says: From when the head</b> of the protrusion in the center <b>of the nipple darkens.</b> The Gemara asks with regard to this suggestion: <b>From when it darkens? One</b> thereby <b>renders her old,</b> i.e., if one accepts this sign, the beginning of maturity is delayed significantly. <b>Rather, Rav Ashi said: From when the head of the protrusion splits. Rabbi Yosei says: From when the nipple</b> grows to such an extent that it <b>is surrounded by a circle. Rabbi Shimon says: From when</b> there is <b>a softening</b>

Daf 47b

of <b>the protuberance above the womb,</b> the mons pubis.
<b>And Rabbi Shimon</b> ben Yoḥai <b>would likewise say: The Sages provided three signs</b> indicating puberty <b>in a woman below,</b> i.e., near her vagina, <b>and</b> they stated three <b>corresponding</b> signs <b>above.</b> If a woman has the signs of <b>an unripe fig above, it is known that she has not grown two</b> pubic <b>hairs;</b> if she has the signs of <b>a ripening fig above, it is known that she has grown two hairs;</b> and if she has the signs of <b>a ripe fig above, it is known that the protuberance has softened.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is this <b>protuberance? Rav Huna says: There is a swollen place</b> in a woman’s body, <b>above that place,</b> a euphemism for the vagina. It is initially hard, but <b>when</b> a girl <b>grows it increasingly softens.</b> The Sages <b>asked Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: With regard to the signs of maturity in woman, <b>in accordance with whose statement is the <i>halakha</i>? He sent them</b> in response: The <i>halakha</i> <b>is stringent in accordance with all of their statements,</b> i.e., if any one of these signs mentioned by the Sages cited above appears in a girl, she must be treated as an adult with regard to all stringent aspects of this classification.
<b>Rav Pappa and Rav Ḥinnana, son of Rav Ika,</b> disagree about the context of this statement of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi that the <i>halakha</i> is stringent in accordance with all of the Sages’ statements. <b>One</b> of them <b>teaches</b> it <b>with regard to this</b> matter, of a woman’s signs of puberty, <b>and</b> the other <b>one teaches</b> it <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>a Tyrian courtyard, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ma’asrot</i> 3:5): <b>What is a Tyrian courtyard, which</b> renders food brought inside it to be <b>required to be tithed? Rabbi Shimon says: A Tyrian courtyard</b> is one <b>inside of which vessels are safe.</b>
The Sages discuss this mishna: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>a Tyrian courtyard? Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The courtyard is called by this name <b>as</b> the custom <b>in</b> the city of <b>Tyre</b> is to <b>place a watchman at the entrance of the courtyard</b> to guard the articles inside. Consequently, any courtyard in which vessels are safe is called a Tyrian courtyard. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> In <b>any</b> courtyard <b>where</b> there is no permanent watchman who locks and unlocks it, but rather <b>one</b> of its residents <b>opens</b> the courtyard <b>and</b> another <b>one locks</b> it, e.g., a courtyard shared by several partners, each of whom can do as he chooses without asking the other, the produce inside it is <b>exempt</b> from the obligation of separating tithe, as such a courtyard is not considered one in which vessels are safe.
<b>Rabbi Neḥemya says: Any</b> courtyard <b>which</b> is hidden from the gaze of outsiders, and therefore <b>a person is not ashamed to eat inside it,</b> that courtyard renders produce inside it <b>obligated</b> to have tithe separated from it. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Any</b> courtyard <b>that</b> one who does not live there <b>can enter it, and</b> the residents <b>do not say to him: What do you want</b> here, produce inside such a courtyard is <b>exempt</b> from tithe.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If there are <b>two courtyards, one within the other,</b> positioned in such a manner that the residents of the inner courtyard cannot enter their houses without passing through the outer courtyard, whereas the residents of the outer courtyard do not traverse the inner one, <b>the inner</b> courtyard renders any produce located inside it <b>obligated</b> to have tithe separated from it, <b>but</b> produce located in <b>the outer</b> courtyard is <b>exempt</b> from tithe. It is not safe, as residents of a different courtyard pass freely through it.
According to the opinion of one of the <i>amora’im</i> mentioned above, i.e., either Rav Pappa or Rav Ḥinnana, son of Rav Ika, it was with regard to this issue that the Sages <b>asked Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>In accordance with whose statement is the <i>halakha</i>? He said to them: The <i>halakha</i> is stringent in accordance with all of</b> the Sages’ <b>statements.</b> In other words, with regard to any courtyard in which produce must be tithed according to any of these opinions, the <i>halakha</i> is that tithe must be separated from this produce.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A girl twelve years and one day old who grew two pubic hairs is classified as a young woman. Six months later, she becomes a grown woman. But a woman who is <b>twenty years old who did not grow two</b> pubic <b>hairs</b> and was never classified as a young woman <b>shall bring proof that she is twenty years old, and</b> from that point forward <b>she</b> assumes the status of <b>a sexually underdeveloped woman [<i>ailonit</i>],</b> who is incapable of bearing children. If she married and her husband died childless, <b>she neither performs <i>ḥalitza</i> nor does she enter into levirate marriage,</b> as the mitzva of levirate marriage applies only to a woman capable of conceiving a child. An <i>ailonit</i> is excluded from that mitzva.
In the case of a man who is <b>twenty years old who did not grow two</b> pubic <b>hairs, they shall bring proof that he is twenty years old and he</b> assumes the status of <b>a sexually underdeveloped man [<i>saris</i>],</b> who is excluded from the mitzva of levirate marriage. Therefore, if his married brother dies childless, <b>he neither performs <i>ḥalitza</i> nor enters into levirate marriage</b> with his <i>yevama</i>. <b>This is the statement of Beit Hillel. Beit Shammai say:</b> For both <b>this</b> case of a woman <b>and that</b> case of a man, they shall bring proof that they are <b>eighteen years old,</b> and they assume the status of a sexually underdeveloped woman and man respectively.
<b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The status of <b>the male</b> is determined <b>in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel,</b> i.e., he assumes the status of a sexually underdeveloped man at the age of twenty; <b>and</b> the status of <b>the female</b> is determined <b>in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai,</b> i.e., she assumes the status of a sexually underdeveloped woman at the age of eighteen. The reason is <b>that the woman is quick to reach</b> physical maturity, and reaches that stage <b>before the man</b> reaches physical maturity.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that a sexually underdeveloped man does not enter into levirate marriage with the widow of his childless brother. <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another mishna (<i>Yevamot</i> 96b): A boy who is <b>nine years and one day old,</b> who has not developed two hairs, <b>and</b> a man who is <b>twenty years old who has not grown two hairs, are one and the same to me</b> with regard to levirate marriage, in that if they engaged in intercourse with the widow of their childless brother, this levirate marriage is partially effective, to the extent that this woman requires both a bill of divorce and <i>ḥalitza</i>.
<b>Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rav says</b> in explanation of the ruling of the mishna here: <b>And this</b> <i>halakha</i> applies only in a case <b>where he developed</b> physical <b>signs of a sexually underdeveloped man</b> (see <i>Yevamot</i> 80b) by the age of twenty. By contrast, the mishna in <i>Yevamot</i> is referring to one who did not develop signs of a sexually underdeveloped man. <b>Rava said:</b> The language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as it teaches: And he is a sexually underdeveloped man,</b> which indicates that he had already developed physical signs of such a condition. The Gemara concludes: <b>Conclude from it</b> that this is the correct interpretation of the mishna.
The Gemara asks a question with regard to the <i>halakha</i> itself: <b>And</b> in a case <b>where he does not develop the signs of a sexually underdeveloped man, until what</b> age is he considered a minor? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches: Until most of his years</b> have passed, i.e., until he reaches the age of thirty-five, halfway to seventy, which is the standard length of a person’s life.
The Gemara relates: <b>When</b> people <b>would come before Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> to inquire about someone who had reached the age of puberty but had not yet developed the physical signs of maturity, <b>if</b> the person in question was <b>thin, he</b> would <b>say to them: Go</b> and <b>fatten him</b> up before we decide on his status. <b>If</b> he was <b>fat,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya would <b>say to them: Go</b> and <b>make him thin. As these signs</b> indicating puberty <b>sometimes come due to thinness</b> and <b>sometimes they come due to fatness.</b> It is therefore possible that after his bodily shape is properly adjusted this individual will develop the signs indicating puberty and will not have the status of a sexually underdeveloped man.
§ <b>Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> in</b> this <b>entire chapter</b> with regard to all of the places where an age is mentioned in years is that even when the phrase: And one day, is not explicitly noted, they are all calculated <b>from</b> the <b>time</b> of year of birth <b>until</b> that same <b>time</b> of year in the age specified. <b>And Ulla said:</b> With regard to cases <b>where we learned</b> in the mishna a quantity of years including the phrase: And one day, <b>we learned</b> that the reference is to full years; <b>and</b> with regard to cases <b>where we did not learn</b> this phrase, i.e., where a quantity of years is mentioned in the mishna without the phrase: And one day, <b>we did not learn</b> it, and part of the final year is equivalent to a whole year.
The Gemara discusses these two opinions. <b>Granted, according to Ulla, this</b> is the reason <b>that</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches there,</b> in previous <i>mishnayot</i> (44b, 45a, 45b): And <b>one day; and here,</b> in this mishna, the <i>tanna</i> <b>does not teach</b> this phrase. <b>But according to Rav, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> be consistent and <b>teach</b> this phrase in all cases, including the mishna here.
<b>And furthermore, it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Keifar says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of a sexually underdeveloped man and a sexually underdeveloped woman: <b>The twentieth year, of which thirty days have passed,</b> i.e., from the age of nineteen and thirty days, <b>is</b> considered <b>like the twentieth year in all regards; and Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>similarly issued</b> a practical <b>ruling</b> of <i>halakha</i> <b>in</b> the city of <b>Lod,</b> that <b>the eighteenth year of which thirty days have passed is</b> considered <b>like the eighteenth year in all regards.</b>
<b>Granted,</b> according to the opinion of Ulla, it is <b>not difficult that Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi is referring to the eighteenth year whereas <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Keifar</b> discusses the twentieth year, as <b>this</b> statement of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai</b> with regard to the age of a sexually underdeveloped woman, and <b>that</b> statement of Rabbi Yosei ben Keifar is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel. But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav,</b> who maintains that full years are required for a sexually underdeveloped man or woman, this <i>baraita</i> poses <b>a difficulty.</b>
The Gemara answers that this matter <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> and Rav maintains in accordance with the opinion that full years are required. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Full years are required with regard to the period of one <b>year stated with regard to sacrificial</b> animals, e.g., “a lamb in its first year” (Leviticus 12:6); the one <b>year stated with regard to houses of walled cities,</b> during which one can redeem a house he has sold in a walled city (see Leviticus 25:29); and the <b>two years</b> stated <b>with regard to an ancestral field,</b> during which one cannot yet redeem an ancestral field he has sold (see Leviticus 25:15).
The <b>six years</b> stated <b>with regard to a Hebrew slave</b> (see Exodus 21:2) <b>and similarly</b> the years <b>of a son and of a daughter,</b> as will be explained, <b>all of</b> these are years <b>from</b> the <b>time</b> of the first year <b>until</b> that same <b>time</b> of year in the year specified, i.e., these periods are units of whole years instead of expiring on predetermined dates, as at the end of the calendar year. This supports the opinion of Rav that the years mentioned with regard to a sexually underdeveloped man or woman are full years.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that the one <b>year stated with regard to sacrificial</b> animals is calculated by whole years and not by calendar years? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said</b> that <b>the verse states: “A lamb in its first year”</b> (Leviticus 12:6). Since the verse does not state: A one-year-old lamb, it means <b>a year</b> based on calculation of <b>its</b> life, <b>and not a year of the universal count,</b> i.e., the calendar year.
The Gemara further asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that the one <b>year stated with regard to houses of walled cities</b> is calculated by a whole year and not by calendar year? <b>The verse states:</b> “Then he may redeem it <b>within a whole year after it is sold,</b> for a full year he shall have the right of redemption” (Leviticus 25:29). The verse is referring to a year counted from the day <b>of its</b> own <b>sale, and not the year of the universal count. From where do we</b> derive that the <b>two years</b> stated <b>with regard to an ancestral field</b> are whole years? <b>The verse states:</b> “According the number of years after the Jubilee you shall buy from your neighbor, and <b>according to the number</b>

Daf 48a

<b>of years of the crops he shall sell to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:15). The plural form of both “years” and “crops” indicates that the number of years does not necessarily correspond to the quantity of crops. Consequently, <b>sometimes you</b> might <b>sell three</b> yields of <b>crops in two years.</b> If one purchases a field in the summer, when the produce has not yet been harvested, and he harvests that yield and subsequently grows and harvests two more crops before the completion of the whole two years, he will have gained three yields in less than two years.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that the <b>six years</b> stated <b>with regard to a Hebrew slave</b> is calculated by whole years? The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “Six years he shall work, and in the seventh</b> he shall go out free for nothing” (Exodus 21:2). The word “and” in the phrase <b>“and in the seventh”</b> indicates that <b>he shall also work</b> in the seventh calendar year, if six full years have not passed since he was sold. For example, if he was sold in the month of Nisan, it means that five years and six months have passed when Tishrei, the first month of the seventh year, arrives; he has not yet completed six years of service, and he must work in this seventh calendar year as well, until the date on which he was sold.
The <i>baraita</i> mentions the years <b>of a son and of a daughter</b> among those calculated as full years. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is this stated? <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says: With regard to valuations,</b> i.e., the age of a valuated male or female is calculated in whole years from the date of his birth, not by calendar years. <b>And Rav Yosef says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is stated <b>with regard to</b> the matters taught in <b>our</b> fifth <b>chapter</b> in tractate <i>Nidda</i>, which is named after its opening words: <b><i>Yotze Dofen</i>,</b> meaning an offspring born by caesarean section. In other words, when a mishna in this chapter mentions years, it means full years, even when it does not state this explicitly.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Do you</b> and Rav <b>disagree</b> with regard to this matter? In other words, as you interpreted the mention of a son and a daughter differently, does each of you reject the halakhic application of the other? Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>No, he said one</b> matter, <b>and I said one</b> different matter, <b>but we do not disagree.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>And this, too, stands to reason, as if it enters your mind</b> that they <b>disagree</b> with regard to this matter, then <b>the one who said</b> full years are required <b>for</b> determining <b>valuations</b> does <b>not say</b> that full years are necessary <b>for</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of this chapter, <b><i>Yotze Dofen</i>. But doesn’t Rav say,</b> like Rav Yosef, that <b>the <i>halakha</i> in</b> this <b>entire chapter</b> with regard to all of the places where an age is mentioned in years is that even when the phrase: And one day, is not explicitly noted, they are all calculated <b>from</b> the <b>time</b> of year of birth <b>until</b> that same <b>time</b> of year in the age specified, not by calendar years?
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if that is correct, then <b>according to</b> Rav, who is <b>the one who said</b> that full years are required <b>for</b> determining <b>valuations, what is the reason</b> that <b>he does not say</b> in his interpretation of the <i>baraita</i> that full years are required <b>for</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>Yotze Dofen</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: Rav maintains that the years of a son and of a daughter mentioned in the <i>baraita</i> are <b>similar to those</b> other cases mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Just as those</b> numbers of years <b>are written</b> in the Torah, <b>so too these</b> years of a son and of a daughter are referring to matters <b>where</b> the years <b>are written</b> in the Torah, i.e., the years of valuations, unlike the topics discussed in <i>Yotze Dofen</i>, where the years are not mentioned explicitly in the Torah.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how would <b>the other</b> <i>amora</i>, Rav Yosef, respond to this contention? The Gemara answers: He would maintain that if the <i>baraita</i> were referring to the years of valuations, which are written in the Torah, then <b>this</b> expression in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Of a son and of a daughter,</b> is unsuitable. Rather, the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have</b> stated: <b>Of the male and of the female,</b> which are the terms the Torah uses with regard to valuations, whereas the terms: Son and daughter, are used in <i>Yotze Dofen</i>.
§ <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Keifar, who said</b> his ruling <b>in the name of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> that a man nineteen years and thirty days of age who has not developed signs of puberty is deemed a sexually underdeveloped man. In this regard, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> May it be God’s will that <b>I merit to ascend</b> to Eretz Yisrael, <b>and</b> that <b>I learn</b> this <b><i>halakha</i> from the mouth of its Master,</b> Rabbi Elazar.
The Gemara recounts that <b>when</b> Rabbi Zeira eventually <b>ascended</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>he</b> indeed <b>found Rabbi Elazar</b> and <b>said to him: Did you say</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Keifar?</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>said to him: I said</b> that it <b>stands to reason</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with his opinion. He elaborated: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> throughout <b>the entire chapter</b> the Mishna <b>teaches:</b> And <b>one day, but here,</b> in the last mishna, <b>it does not teach</b> this phrase, one can <b>conclude from it</b> that it <b>stands to reason</b> that there is a reason for this discrepancy, <b>in accordance with the opinion of</b> Rabbi Yosei ben Keifar.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>the lower sign</b> of puberty, two pubic hairs, <b>appeared</b> in a young woman <b>before the upper</b> sign, development of the breasts, <b>appeared,</b> then she is an adult, as the pubic hairs are an unequivocal sign. Therefore, if her childless husband died and she came before her husband’s brother [<i>yavam</i>] for levirate marriage, <b>she either performs the ritual through which a <i>yavam</i> frees a <i>yevama</i> of her levirate bonds [<i>ḥalitza</i>] or enters into levirate marriage</b> with her husband’s brother.
If <b>the upper</b> sign indicating puberty <b>appeared before the lower</b> sign <b>appeared,</b> i.e., the two pubic hairs are not visible, <b>although that</b> order of development is apparently <b>impossible, Rabbi Meir says:</b> In fact, it is possible for the breasts to develop before the growth of two pubic hairs, and the concern is that the two hairs did not grow and fall out but rather they never grew in the first place, which would mean that she remains a minor. Therefore, if her childless husband dies, <b>she neither performs <i>ḥalitza</i> nor does she enter into levirate marriage</b> with her husband’s brother.
<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> She has reached majority, and therefore if her childless husband dies <b>she either performs <i>ḥalitza</i> or enters into levirate marriage</b> with her husband’s brother. That is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the Sages <b>said:</b> It is <b>possible for the lower</b> sign of puberty <b>to appear before the upper</b> sign <b>appears; but</b> it is <b>impossible for the upper</b> sign <b>to appear before the lower</b> sign <b>appears.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis disagree with regard to the <i>halakha</i> when the upper sign of puberty appears before the lower sign. The mishna stated about that case: <b>Although that</b> order of development is <b>impossible.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> the mishna explicitly states that it is referring to a situation where the upper sign <b>did appear</b> before the lower one. The Gemara explains: When the mishna states that it <b>did appear,</b> that is <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who maintains that such an occurrence is possible, whereas when the mishna teaches: <b>Although that</b> order of development is <b>impossible,</b> it is referring <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who contend that it is not possible.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> why is it necessary at all to mention the phrase: Although that order of development is impossible. Instead, let the mishna simply <b>teach:</b> If <b>the upper</b> sign of puberty <b>appeared, Rabbi Meir says: She neither performs <i>ḥalitza</i> nor does she enter into levirate marriage</b> with her husband’s brother; <b>and the Rabbis say: She either performs <i>ḥalitza</i> or enters into levirate marriage</b> with her husband’s brother. <b>And I would know</b> that the ruling of the Rabbis is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is impossible</b> for the upper sign of puberty to appear before the lower sign.
The Gemara explains: <b>If</b> the mishna <b>had not taught: Although that</b> order of development is <b>impossible, I would say</b> that with regard to <b>most women the lower</b> sign <b>appears first,</b> before the upper sign; <b>but</b> in <b>a minority of women, the upper</b> sign <b>appears first. And Rabbi Meir,</b> who rules that she is a minor who may not perform either <i>ḥalitza</i> or enter into levirate marriage, conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, that one must be concerned for the minority.</b> In other words, Rabbi Meir takes into account the minority of women in whom the upper sign appears first, and therefore he considers her to be a minor. <b>And the Rabbis</b> likewise conform to their standard line of <b>reasoning that one need not be concerned for the minority,</b> and therefore they consider the young woman to have reached majority.
<b>And this statement,</b> that one can rely on the assumption that if a woman has the upper sign then she certainly has the lower sign, while the minority of cases are not taken into account, applies only <b>in an ordinary</b> case, where the woman was not examined to determine if she had the lower sign. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where we examined</b> her <b>and did not find</b> the lower sign, one might <b>say</b> that <b>the Rabbis concede to Rabbi Meir that</b> the <b>upper</b> sign appeared <b>before</b> the lower sign, and therefore she neither performs <i>ḥalitza</i> nor enters into levirate marriage with her husband’s brother.
Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us that</b> according to the Rabbis it is <b>impossible</b> for the upper sign to precede the lower sign, which means that even if she was examined and no lower sign was found, the assumption is that the two hairs of the lower sign had <b>certainly appeared, but</b> later they <b>fell out.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who holds that it is possible for the upper sign to precede the lower, <b>that</b> accounts for that verse <b>which is written</b> with regard to a maturing young woman: “And you increased and grew up, and you came to excellent beauty; <b>your breasts were fashioned, and your hair was grown”</b> (Ezekiel 16:7). This verse mentions the upper sign before the lower sign. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> the verse <b>should have</b> said the <b>reverse,</b> first stating “your hair has grown,” and then stating “your breasts were fashioned.” The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what the verse <b>is saying: Since your breasts were fashioned, it is known that your hair was</b> already <b>grown.</b>
The Gemara raises a further difficulty: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> this accounts for <b>that which is written: “When they from Egypt bruised your breasts for the sprouting forth of your young womanhood”</b> (Ezekiel 23:21). This verse, which compares the Jewish people to a promiscuous girl, describes how, in her childhood, Egyptian men would play with her by pressing her breasts in order to engage in licentious sexual intercourse with her when she became a young woman, i.e., once the pubic hairs that indicate puberty developed. This indicates that it is possible for the upper sign to appear before the lower sign. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> the verse <b>should have</b> said the <b>reverse.</b>
The Gemara similarly answers that <b>this</b> is what the verse <b>is saying: Since your breasts appeared, it is known that</b> the pubic hairs, which are the sign of <b>your young womanhood, have</b> already <b>appeared.</b> Or <b>if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>The sprouting forth of [<i>shedei</i>]</b> your young womanhood? It is not speaking of the lower sign, but rather of the upper sign, i.e., the <b>entire</b> verse <b>is written</b> in reference <b>to the breasts,</b> <i>shadayim</i> in Hebrew. <b>And this</b> is what <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, is saying to the Jewish people:</b>

Daf 48b

Although <b>your breasts began to develop, you</b> still <b>did not reform</b> your ways, and you continued to act licentiously. And furthermore, even when <b>your breasts grew fully, you also did not reform</b> your ways.
§ The Gemara asks: <b>In any event, everyone,</b> both Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis, agrees that <b>we rely on the lower</b> sign. <b>From where do we</b> derive that we rely exclusively on the lower sign and do not require the appearance of the upper sign as well? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said, and likewise</b> a Sage of <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: The verse states: “A man or woman, when they commit any of the sins of men”</b> (Numbers 5:6). <b>The Torah</b> thereby <b>rendered a woman equal to a man with regard to all punishments of the Torah. Just as a man</b> is considered to have reached majority based <b>on one sign,</b> i.e., the lower sign of two pubic hairs, <b>so too, a woman</b> reaches majority based <b>on one sign,</b> the lower sign.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that although a woman’s status, like that of a man, depends on one sign, in the case of a woman she reaches majority <b>either</b> through <b>this,</b> the lower sign, <b>or that,</b> the upper sign. From where is it derived that it must be specifically the lower sign? The Gemara answers: This is based on the same comparison of men and women. Her <i>halakha</i> is <b>like</b> that of <b>a man: Just as a man</b> reaches majority based on the <b>lower</b> sign <b>and not</b> the <b>upper</b> sign, as this is not applicable to him, <b>so too, a woman</b> reaches majority based on the <b>lower</b> sign <b>and not</b> the <b>upper</b> sign.
The Gemara notes that <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>, that the lower sign is sufficient by itself for a woman, <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, said: This</b> is <b>how</b> the Sages <b>would explain it in</b> the study hall of <b>Yavne. They said: Once</b> the <b>lower</b> sign has <b>appeared, we no longer concern ourselves with</b> the appearance of the <b>upper</b> sign in order to establish a woman’s status, as she is considered to have reached her majority by virtue of the lower sign.
§ It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with regard to the appearance of signs indicating puberty in young women, that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> In the case of young <b>women</b> who reside in <b>cities,</b> the <b>lower</b> sign <b>appears</b> more <b>quickly</b> than the upper sign, <b>because they frequent the bathhouses,</b> which stimulates the growth of the hair. By contrast, in the case of young <b>women</b> who reside in <b>villages,</b> the <b>upper</b> sign <b>appears</b> more <b>quickly</b> than the lower sign, <b>because they grind with mills,</b> which develops their breasts.
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> There are differences in the rate of development of the breasts. In the case of <b>the daughters of the wealthy,</b> the growth of the breast on the <b>right side arrives</b> more <b>quickly</b> than that of the left side, <b>as</b> it <b>rubs against their upper body cloaks,</b> which are worn by the wealthy. By contrast, in the case of <b>the daughters of the poor,</b> the growth of the breast on the <b>left side arrives</b> more <b>quickly</b> than that of the right side, <b>because they draw jugs of water on</b> that side. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the left breast develops more quickly <b>because they carry their</b> younger <b>brothers on their</b> left <b>sides.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The growth of the breast on the <b>left side</b> arrives <b>before</b> that of the <b>right side. Rabbi Ḥanina, son of the brother of Rabbi Yehoshua, says:</b> It <b>never</b> occurred that the growth of the breast on the <b>left side</b> arrived <b>before</b> that of the <b>right side, except for</b> the case of <b>one</b> young woman <b>who was in my neighborhood, as</b> the growth of the breast on her <b>left side</b> arrived <b>before</b> that of the <b>right side, and</b> later the right breast <b>returned to its normal condition</b> and developed normally.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All</b> girls who <b>are examined</b> to determine whether or not their signs indicating puberty have appeared <b>are examined based on</b> the testimony of <b>women. And likewise, Rabbi Eliezer</b> would follow this <i>halakha</i> in practice and <b>give</b> the girls <b>to his wife</b> to examine, <b>and Rabbi Yishmael</b> would similarly <b>give</b> the girls <b>to his mother</b> to examine.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Before the</b> minimum <b>age</b> at which pubic hair is considered a sign, i.e., eleven years and one day, when any hair that is found is considered to be merely a mole and not a sign, <b>and</b> similarly <b>after the age</b> of majority, twelve years and one day, when a female is presumed to have grown pubic hair like most girls her age, <b>women may examine them</b> and their testimony is accepted. But <b>during the time</b> between eleven years and one day and twelve years and one day, <b>women may not examine them.</b> The reason is <b>that one does not resolve</b> cases of <b>uncertainty based on</b> the testimony of <b>women. Rabbi Shimon says: Even during the time</b> between eleven years and one day and twelve years and one day, <b>women may examine them. And a woman is deemed credible,</b> and her testimony is accepted, <b>to be stringent but not to be lenient.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>How so,</b> i.e., how is a woman’s testimony accepted with regard to the girl she has examined as a stringency but not a leniency? If the woman said that the girl is <b>a female who reached majority,</b> her claim is accepted to the extent <b>that she does not perform refusal.</b> The refusal of a husband, which applies in the case of a girl whose father had died and who was married off by her mother or brother, can be performed by the girl only until she reaches majority. If the woman said that this girl is <b>a minor,</b> her testimony is accepted to the extent <b>that she does not perform <i>ḥalitza</i>.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>But</b> the woman who examined the girl is <b>not deemed credible to say</b> that she <b>is a minor girl</b> to the extent <b>that she performs refusal. And</b> likewise, the woman is not deemed credible to say that she <b>is a female who reached majority to</b> the extent <b>that she performs <i>ḥalitza</i>.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Before the</b> minimum <b>age</b> at which pubic hair is considered a sign, <b>and</b> similarly <b>after the age</b> of majority, <b>women may examine them.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Granted,</b> one can understand that <b>before the</b> minimum <b>age</b> there is <b>a requirement</b> for <b>examination,</b> so <b>that if</b> they <b>find</b> hair <b>after the</b> minimum <b>age</b> which they already saw before the minimum age, these hairs <b>are</b> evidently a mere <b>mole,</b> not a sign of maturity.
<b>But why do I</b> need a girl to undergo <b>an examination after the age</b> of majority? <b>Didn’t Rava say: A minor girl who reached her full years,</b> i.e., her age of majority, twelve years and one day, <b>does not require an examination,</b> as there is <b>a presumption</b> that <b>she has developed signs</b> indicating puberty? The Gemara explains: <b>When Rava said</b> that one relies on this <b>presumption,</b> he was referring specifically <b>to</b> her inability from now on to perform <b>refusal. But with regard to <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> she <b>requires an examination</b> to determine that she has reached maturity.
The <i>baraita</i> stated that according to Rabbi Yehuda, women are deemed credible to examine girls who are either younger than eleven years and one day or older than twelve years and one day. But <b>during the time</b> between eleven years and one day and twelve years and one day, <b>women may not examine them.</b> The Gemara explains that Rabbi Yehuda <b>holds</b> that the period <b>during</b> this <b>time</b> is considered like <b>after the age</b> of majority. In other words, the signs indicating puberty that a girl develops during this time are considered to be full-fledged signs, which means that she has reached majority even before the age of twelve and one day. Accordingly, the testimony of women is not accepted for this period, as her change of status enables her to perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with her husband’s brother.
<b>But after the</b> minimum <b>age</b> of twelve years and one day, <b>when there is the presumption of Rava</b> that a girl has already developed signs indicating puberty, one <b>may rely on women and</b> have them <b>examine</b> the girl. <b>During</b> this <b>age,</b> between eleven and twelve, <b>when there is no presumption of Rava</b> that she has already developed signs indicating puberty, one <b>may not rely on women, and</b> therefore <b>women may not examine</b> the girl.
By contrast, <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that <b>even during</b> this <b>age,</b> between eleven years and one day and twelve years and one day, <b>women may examine</b> girls to determine if they have grown pubic hair. This is because Rabbi Shimon <b>holds</b> that the period <b>during</b> this <b>age</b> is considered <b>like before the</b> minimum <b>age,</b> which means that the girl is a minor based on her age, regardless of the results of the examination. <b>And</b> the only reason she <b>requires an examination</b> is <b>that if</b> they <b>find</b> hair <b>after the</b> minimum <b>age,</b> which they had already seen before the minimum age, these hairs <b>are</b> deemed a mere <b>mole,</b> not a sign of maturity.
The <i>baraita</i> further teaches: <b>And a woman is deemed credible</b> to testify <b>to be stringent</b> with regard to the girl who she examined <b>but not to be lenient.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Who taught this</b> <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and</b> it is referring to <b>during</b> the <b>age</b> between eleven years and one day and twelve and one day.

Daf 49a

<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the <i>tanna</i> who taught this ruling was <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> and the <i>baraita</i> is referring to an examination conducted <b>after the age</b> of majority. <b>And</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>does not</b> accept <b>the presumption of Rava</b> that a girl of this age has already developed signs indicating puberty.
§ The mishna teaches that according to the Rabbis a young woman who apparently developed the upper sign before the lower sign has reached majority, and therefore if her childless husband died she either performs <i>ḥalitza</i> or enters into levirate marriage with her husband’s brother. This ruling is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the Sages <b>said:</b> It is <b>possible</b> for the lower sign of puberty to appear before the upper sign, but it is impossible for the upper sign to appear before the lower sign. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>this additional</b> repetition of this point? <b>It was</b> already <b>taught in the first clause</b> that it is impossible for the upper sign to appear without the lower sign having already appeared.
<b>And if you would say</b> that it is repeated <b>because</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>wants</b> to teach <b>an unattributed</b> mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> in order to establish that the <i>halakha</i> follows their opinion in their dispute with Rabbi Meir, that cannot be the case. The Gemara explains why this suggestion is incorrect: This is <b>obvious,</b> as there is a principle that in a dispute between <b>an individual</b> Sage <b>and a majority</b> of other Sages, the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is always decided <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the majority.</b>
The Gemara answers: It is necessary for the <i>tanna</i> to state that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis despite the fact that they are the majority, <b>lest you say that the rationale for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir is</b> more <b>reasonable.</b> One might have thought this, <b>as the verses</b> cited above <b>support it:</b> “Your breasts were fashioned, and your hair was grown,” and: “When they from Egypt bruised your breasts for the sprouting forth of your young womanhood.” Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the <i>tanna</i> repeated the claim that the upper sign cannot precede the lower one <b>because</b> he <b>wants to teach</b> a case in the next mishna which is <b>similar to</b> this one, i.e., this summary provides a transition to the <i>halakha</i> brought in the following mishna.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Similar to</b> the order of the appearance of the signs of puberty in a girl, where it is impossible for the upper sign to appear before the lower sign, there is an analogous principle with regard to the mutual dependency of two items: <b>Any earthenware vessel</b> with a hole <b>that enables entry</b> of liquid into the vessel certainly <b>enables exit</b> of liquid through that hole, and it thereby ceases to be a vessel fit for sanctification of the waters mixed with the ashes of the red heifer. <b>And there are</b> holes <b>that enable exit</b> of liquids from the earthenware vessels <b>but do not enable entry</b> of liquids from outside the vessel, and therefore it remains a vessel.
Likewise, <b>in any limb</b> of the body <b>where there is a nail, there is</b> certainly <b>a bone in it</b> as well. If it is the limb of a corpse, it transmits ritual impurity through contact, movement, and in a tent, even if its size is less than that of an olive-bulk. <b>And there are</b> limbs <b>in which there is a bone but</b> yet <b>there is not a nail in it.</b> That limb does not transmit impurity in a tent if its size is less than that of an olive-bulk.
Similarly, <b>any</b> item <b>that becomes ritually impure</b> with impurity of a <i>zav</i> imparted by <b>treading,</b> e.g., a vessel designated for sitting, <b>becomes ritually impure</b> with <b>impurity imparted by a corpse. And there are</b> vessels <b>that become ritually impure</b> with <b>impurity imparted by a corpse but do not become ritually impure</b> with impurity of a <i>zav</i> imparted by <b>treading.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that any earthenware vessel with a hole that enables entry of liquid into the vessel certainly enables exit of liquid through that hole, whereas there are holes that enable exit of liquids but do not enable entry. The Gemara explains the halakhic significance of this distinction. A vessel that contains a hole that is large enough to enable liquid to <b>enter</b> is no longer considered a vessel and is therefore <b>unfit to</b> contain the <b>water of purification. And</b> it is also <b>disqualified as a shard [<i>gastera</i>]</b> of a vessel. A shard still has some utility and is therefore susceptible to ritual impurity. By contrast, an earthenware vessel that contains a small hole <b>that enables</b> only the <b>exit</b> of liquids is <b>fit for</b> the <b>water of purification, but</b> is <b>disqualified as a shard</b> of a vessel.
<b>Rav Asi says</b> that <b>they teach</b> the following <i>halakha</i>: In the case of <b>an earthenware vessel, its measure</b> of a hole that renders it no longer ritually impure is one that is large enough <b>to enable liquid to enter</b> it. <b>And they said</b> that the measure of a small hole is that <b>which enables</b> the <b>exit</b> of <b>liquids only with regard to a shard.</b> The Gemara inquires: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Mar Zutra, son of Rav Naḥman, said:</b> It is <b>because</b> people <b>do not say: Bring</b> another <b>shard to</b> seal the leak of <b>a shard;</b> rather, they throw it out immediately. A shard is used as a plate beneath a perforated earthenware vessel. If the shard itself is also perforated and leaks, it is no longer of any use.
§ On the topic of holes in earthenware vessels, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How does one test</b> a broken <b>earthenware vessel to know if it was pierced</b> with a hole <b>that enables liquid to enter</b> it <b>or not? One brings a tub filled with water and places</b> the broken <b>pot into it. If</b> the water from the tub <b>enters</b> the pot, <b>it is known that</b> the pot contains a hole <b>that enables liquid to enter. And if</b> the water does <b>not</b> enter the pot, <b>it is known that</b> the vessel contains only a small hole <b>that</b> merely <b>enables</b> the <b>exit</b> of <b>liquids.</b>

Daf 49b

<b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that the method for determining whether an earthenware vessel contains a hole that allows liquid to enter is as follows: One takes the <b>handles of the pot and turns it over,</b>placing it upside down <b>in</b> an empty tub, <b>and</b> he then <b>covers</b> the pot with <b>water. If</b> water <b>enters</b> the pot, <b>it is known that</b> it contains a hole <b>that enables liquid to enter, and if</b> the water does <b>not</b> enter the pot, <b>it is known that</b> the vessel contains a small hole <b>that enables</b> only the <b>exit</b> of <b>liquids.</b>
<b>Or</b> one can determine the size of the hole by the following method: One <b>places</b> the pot, with liquid in it, <b>on the fire. If the fire holds</b> the liquid back and does not allow it to exit the vessel, then <b>it is known</b> that the vessel contains a small hole <b>that enables</b> only the <b>exit</b> of <b>liquids. And if</b> the fire does <b>not</b> hold the liquid back and does not prevent it from exiting the vessel, then <b>it is known</b> that it contains a hole <b>that enables liquid to enter.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: One should not place</b> the pot with liquid in it <b>on the fire.</b> This is not a reliable test for determining the size of the hole, as it is possible that the hole is actually large enough to enable liquid to enter, but nevertheless <b>the fire prevents</b> the liquid from exiting. <b>Rather, one places</b> the pot with liquid in it <b>on hot ash. If the hot ash holds</b> the liquid back and does not allow it to exit the vessel, then <b>it is known</b> that the vessel contains a small hole <b>that enables</b> only the <b>exit</b> of <b>liquids. But if</b> the hot ash does <b>not</b> hold the liquid back and does not prevent it from exiting the vessel, <b>it is known</b> that it contains a hole <b>that enables liquid to enter.</b> Another manner of testing is to fill the vessel with liquid. If it <b>drips</b> one <b>drop after</b> another <b>drop, it is known</b> that it contains a hole <b>that enables liquid to enter.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> difference <b>is there between</b> the method of testing stated by <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> placing the vessel in a tub of water, and that <b>of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> placing the vessel upside down into the tub and then covering it with water? <b>Ulla said:</b> The difference <b>between</b> their opinions is whether liquid that <b>enters</b> through a hole <b>with difficulty,</b> i.e., as the result of force, is considered entering. According to Rabbi Yehuda, placing the vessel directly into a tub of water constitutes the use of force to a certain degree, and he maintains that if water enters the vessel in such a case, this does not count as liquid entering the vessel. Therefore, he rejects the testing method of the first <i>tanna</i>.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>In any limb</b> of the body <b>where there is a nail,</b> there is certainly a bone in it as well. But it is possible for there to be limbs that contain a bone without a nail. The Gemara explains the halakhic significance of this distinction. A limb <b>in which there is a nail</b> and which therefore certainly contains a bone has the status of a full-fledged limb. Therefore, it <b>transmits impurity</b> through <b>contact, movement, and in a tent,</b> even if its size is less than that of an olive-bulk. By contrast, if <b>there is a bone in</b> the limb <b>but there is no nail,</b> it <b>transmits impurity</b> through <b>contact and movement</b> even if its size is less than that of an olive-bulk, <b>but</b> it does <b>not transmit impurity in a tent</b> unless its size is that of an olive-bulk.
<b>Rav Ḥisda says: The</b> following <b>matter was stated by our great rabbi,</b> Rav, <b>may the Omnipresent</b> come <b>to his assistance. An extra finger</b> on one’s hand <b>in which there is a bone but there is no nail transmits impurity</b> through <b>contact and movement</b> even if its size is less than that of an olive-bulk, <b>but</b> it does <b>not transmit impurity in a tent.</b>
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i>, that it must contain both bone and a nail for it to be considered a limb, only in a case <b>where</b> this finger <b>cannot be counted along the back of the hand,</b> i.e., the extra finger is not aligned with the others. But if it is aligned with the other fingers then it is considered like any other limb and imparts impurity in a tent, whether or not it contains a nail.
§ The mishna further teaches: Similarly, <b>any</b> item that <b>becomes ritually impure</b> with impurity of a <i>zav</i> imparted by <b>treading</b> becomes ritually impure with impurity imparted by a corpse. The Gemara explains that this means that <b>any item that is fit to</b> become impure with the impurity of a <i>zav</i> imparted by <b>treading</b> is fit to <b>become ritually impure</b> with <b>impurity imparted by a corpse.</b>
The mishna continues: <b>And there are</b> vessels <b>that become ritually impure</b> with <b>impurity imparted by a corpse but do not become ritually impure</b> with impurity of a <i>zav</i> imparted by <b>treading.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by this statement? The Gemara answers: This serves <b>to add</b> a measuring vessel, e.g., the measure of <b>a <i>se’a</i> or a half-<i>se’a</i> [<i>vetarkav</i>].</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the impurity of the treading of a <i>zav</i>: <b>“And he who sits on</b> any <b>object</b> whereon the <i>zav</i> sits shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and is impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:6). One <b>might</b> have thought that if a <i>zav</i> <b>turned over</b> a vessel used to measure <b>a <i>se’a</i> and sat on it, or</b> if he turned over a vessel used to measure <b>a half-<i>se’a</i> and sat on it,</b> that vessel <b>should be</b> rendered <b>impure</b> as a seat upon which a <i>zav</i> sat.
Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And he who sits on any object <b>whereon the <i>zav</i> sits”</b> (Leviticus 15:6). The wording of the verse indicates that it is speaking of an object <b>that is designated for sitting,</b> i.e., upon which people generally sit, <b>excluding such</b> a vessel, with regard to <b>which we say to</b> someone sitting on it: <b>Stand up and</b> allow us to use it to <b>do our work,</b> i.e., to measure. This is not defined as a vessel used for sitting, as it serves another function.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Any</b> person <b>who is fit to adjudicate</b> cases of <b>capital law is fit to adjudicate</b> cases of <b>monetary law, and there are</b> those <b>who are fit to adjudicate</b> cases of <b>monetary law but are unfit to adjudicate</b> cases of <b>capital law.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> The statement of the mishna that some are fit to adjudicate cases of monetary law but are unfit to adjudicate cases of capital law serves <b>to add</b> the case of <b>a <i>mamzer</i>.</b> Although he may not adjudicate cases of capital law, nevertheless he may adjudicate cases of monetary law.
The Gemara asks: Why is it necessary to teach this here? <b>We</b> already <b>learned</b> this on <b>another occasion,</b> in a mishna (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 32a): <b>All are fit to judge</b> cases of <b>monetary law, but not all are fit to judge</b> cases of <b>capital law. And we discussed it,</b> and asked <b>what is added</b> by the phrase: All are fit to judge. <b>And Rav Yehuda said</b> in response that this serves <b>to add</b> the case of <b>a <i>mamzer</i>.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>One</b> mishna serves <b>to add</b> the case of <b>a convert, and one</b> other mishna serves <b>to add</b> the case of <b>a <i>mamzer</i>.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>And</b> both additions <b>are necessary. As, if</b> the <i>mishnayot</i> had <b>taught us</b> only that <b>a convert</b> is fit to judge cases of monetary law, one might have said that the <i>halakha</i> is lenient in the case of a convert <b>because</b> he is <b>fit to enter into the congregation,</b> i.e., marry a Jewish woman. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a <i>mamzer</i>, who is unfit to enter into the congregation,</b> one might <b>say</b> that <b>he</b> is <b>not</b> fit to judge cases of monetary law.
<b>And if</b> the <i>mishnayot</i> had <b>taught us</b> only that <b>a <i>mamzer</i></b> is fit to judge cases of monetary law, one might have said that the <i>halakha</i> is lenient in the case of a <i>mamzer</i> <b>because he comes from a fit drop</b> of semen, i.e., his father is Jewish. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a convert, who comes from an unfit drop,</b> as he was born a gentile, one might <b>say</b> that he is <b>not</b> fit to judge cases of monetary law. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to teach the <i>halakhot</i> of both a convert and a <i>mamzer</i>.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Any</b> person <b>who is fit to adjudicate</b> a case and serve as a judge <b>is fit to testify</b> as a witness, <b>and there are</b> those <b>who are fit to testify but are not fit to adjudicate.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by this statement, that some people are fit to testify but not to adjudicate? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This serves <b>to add one who is blind in one of his eyes. And</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this ruling?

Daf 50a

<b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “According to their word shall every dispute and every leprous mark be”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:5)? <b>What do disputes have to do with leprous marks?</b> The verse <b>juxtaposes disputes to leprous marks,</b> to teach that <b>just as leprous marks</b> are viewed by a priest only <b>in the daytime, as it is written</b> with regard to leprous marks: <b>“And on the day when</b> raw flesh <b>appears in him</b> he shall be impure” (Leviticus 13:14), <b>so too, disputes</b> are adjudicated only <b>in the daytime.</b>
<b>And just as leprous marks</b> are seen by priests who can see, but <b>not by blind</b> priests, <b>as it is written: “As far as appears to the priest”</b> (Leviticus 13:12), which teaches that they must be viewed by priests who can see with both eyes, <b>so too, disputes are not</b> adjudicated <b>by blind judges,</b> even if they are blind in only one eye. <b>And</b> the verse <b>juxtaposes leprous marks to disputes</b> to teach that <b>just as disputes may not</b> be judged <b>by relatives</b> of the litigants, <b>so too, leprous marks may not</b> be viewed <b>by</b> a priest who is <b>a relative</b> of the afflicted party.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>If</b> these two <i>halakhot</i> are compared, one can also say that <b>just as disputes</b> are judged specifically <b>by three</b> judges, <b>so too, leprous marks</b> must be viewed <b>by three</b> priests. <b>And this</b> suggestion is supported by <b>a logical inference:</b> If a case that only involves <b>one’s money</b> is adjudicated <b>by three</b> judges, <b>all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that leprous marks, which afflict the person <b>himself,</b> should be viewed by three priests? To counter this notion, <b>the verse states: “And he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons, the priests”</b> (Leviticus 13:2). <b>You</b> have <b>learned</b> from this <b>that even one priest may view leprous marks.</b>
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain blind person who was</b> living <b>in the neighborhood of Rabbi Yoḥanan who would render judgments, and</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>did not say anything to him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>How could</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>do this? But didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> himself <b>say</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the ruling of <b>an unattributed mishna?</b>
<b>And we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>Any</b> person <b>who is fit to adjudicate</b> a case and serve as a judge <b>is fit to testify</b> as a witness, <b>and there are</b> those who are <b>fit to testify but</b> are <b>not fit to adjudicate. And we said: What is added</b> by this <i>halakha</i>, <b>and Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It serves <b>to add one who is blind in one of his eyes,</b> as he is fit to testify but unfit to judge. Since Rabbi Yoḥanan evidently maintains that one who is blind even in one of his eyes is not fit to judge, why did he not admonish this judge?
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan found another unattributed mishna</b> which indicates a different conclusion. <b>As we learned</b> in the mishna in tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> (32a): In cases of <b>monetary law,</b> the court <b>judges during the daytime, and concludes</b> the deliberations and issues their ruling even <b>at night.</b> This is not the <i>halakha</i> with regard to leprous marks, which may not be viewed at night at all. Accordingly, one does not compare judging cases of monetary law to viewing leprous marks. Since this comparison was the source for disqualifying a blind judge, one cannot derive from it that a blind judge is disqualified.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> manner is <b>the strength of that unattributed</b> mishna in tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> greater <b>than</b> the strength of <b>this unattributed</b> mishna here? Why did Rabbi Yoḥanan accept the ruling of that mishna? The Gemara explains: <b>If you wish, say</b> that <b>an unattributed</b> mishna that records the opinion <b>of many</b> Sages, as in <i>Sanhedrin</i>, is <b>preferable,</b> whereas the mishna here was established as in accordance with the individual opinion of Rabbi Meir. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it is <b>because</b> the mishna in <i>Sanhedrin</i> <b>teaches this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>in the context of the <i>halakhot</i> of judges.</b> Since that chapter is the primary source for all of the <i>halakhot</i> of court matters, its rulings are of greater weight.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Any</b> food from <b>which</b> one is <b>obligated to</b> separate <b>tithes becomes impure with the ritual impurity of food; and there is</b> food <b>that becomes impure with the ritual impurity of food but</b> from <b>which one is not obligated to</b> separate <b>tithes.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the last clause of this mishna? The Gemara answers: This serves <b>to add meat, fish, and eggs.</b> Although they are subject to the ritual impurity of food, one is not obligated to separate tithes from them.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>any</b> produce from <b>which</b> one is <b>obligated to</b> designate <b>produce in the corner of the field given to the poor [<i>pe’a</i>],</b> as commanded in the Torah (see Leviticus 19:9, 23:22), one is <b>obligated to</b> separate <b>tithes</b> from it; <b>and there is</b> produce from <b>which</b> one is <b>obligated to</b> separate <b>tithes but</b> from <b>which one is not obligated to</b> designate <b><i>pe’a</i>.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the last clause of the mishna? The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to add figs and vegetables,</b> for <b>which</b> one is <b>not obligated to</b> designate <b><i>pe’a</i>,</b> although the obligation of tithes does apply to them. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 1:4): The Sages <b>stated a principle with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>pe’a</i>:</b> With regard to <b>anything that is food, and is protected, and</b> that <b>grows from the earth, and is gathered as one,</b> i.e., there is one fixed time for gathering it, <b>and</b> that one <b>brings in</b> to store <b>for preservation,</b> its owner <b>is obligated to</b> designate <b><i>pe’a</i>.</b>
The Gemara analyzes each criterion of the mishna. The clause: <b>Anything that is food,</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> the <b><i>sefiḥin</i>,</b> produce that grew without being intentionally planted, <b>of woad [<i>setim</i>] and safflower [<i>vekotza</i>].</b> These plants are used as dyes rather than for food. The clause: <b>And is protected,</b> serves <b>to exclude ownerless</b> crops, which no one protects. The clause: <b>And grows from the earth,</b> serves <b>to exclude truffles and mushrooms,</b> which do not draw sustenance from the ground. The clause: <b>And is gathered as one,</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> the <b>fig</b> tree, whose fruit is gathered over an extended period, as the figs do not all ripen at the same time. Finally, the clause: <b>And</b> that <b>one brings in</b> to storage <b>for preservation,</b> serves <b>to exclude vegetables,</b> which cannot be stored for lengthy periods.
<b>And yet</b> in the case <b>of tithe, we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ma’asrot</i> 1:1) with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of tithes: <b>Anything that is food, and is protected, and grows from the earth is obligated in tithes. And whereas</b> some of the conditions overlap, the following criteria <b>are not taught</b> with regard to tithes: <b>Gathered as one, and that one brings in</b> to storage <b>for preservation.</b> Evidently, the obligation of tithes applies to fig trees and vegetables, despite the fact that the obligation of <i>pe’a</i> does not apply.
The Gemara notes that <b>if</b> these vegetables that are exempt from <i>pe’a</i> <b>contained garlic and onions,</b> which are stored for an extended period of time, then they are <b>obligated</b> in <i>pe’a</i> as well. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 3:4): If one has <b>garden beds of onions that are between the vegetables, Rabbi Yosei says</b> that one leaves a separate <b><i>pe’a</i> from each and every one</b> of the beds. <b>And the Rabbis say</b> one leaves <i>pe’a</i> <b>from one</b> garden bed <b>for all</b> of them.
§ <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the case of <b>endives that were initially planted</b> to be fed <b>to animals, and</b> later the owner <b>reconsidered their</b> designation and decided to use them <b>for human</b> consumption

Daf 50b

<b>they require intent</b> to be used for human consumption <b>once they are detached</b> from the ground, in order for them to be susceptible to ritual impurity. Rabbi Yoḥanan rules in this manner because he <b>holds</b> that <b>intent</b> to designate produce while it is <b>attached</b> to the ground <b>is not considered intent.</b>
<b>Rava said: We learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 1:1) <b>as well: Thirteen matters were stated with regard to the carcass of a kosher bird, and this is one of them:</b> In order for such a carcass to be susceptible to impurity and to be capable of imparting impurity to food through contact, it <b>requires</b> a person’s <b>intention</b> to eat it, <b>but it does not require</b> exposure to liquid to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity. Even if one had intent to eat the bird while it was still alive, intent is still required after it became a carcass for it to transmit impurity. Rava concludes: <b>Evidently, intent</b> that the bird be eaten while the bird is <b>alive is not considered intent. Here too, intent</b> to designate produce while it is <b>attached</b> to the ground <b>is not considered intent.</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> Rava’s proof is inconclusive, as <b>here we are dealing with a young bird that fell from a height, where</b> the bird <b>was not before us</b> prior to it becoming a carcass, <b>so that</b> one could have had <b>intent that it</b> is food. Consequently, it requires intent afterward for it to impart impurity, but had there been intent while it was still alive, that would have sufficed.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rabbi Zeira: <b>What is there to say</b> about the case of the <b>chicken in Yavne?</b> In that instance the Sages deemed the chicken impure due to intent only after it became a carcass, despite the fact that it was present before them while it was alive. This apparently indicates that intent which occurred while the bird was alive is not considered intent. Rabbi Zeira <b>said to</b> Abaye: That <b>was</b> actually <b>a wild chicken,</b> which was not before them while it was alive, and therefore there was no intent that it should be food while it was alive.
Those who heard this comment <b>laughed at</b> Rabbi Zeira’s interpretation: <b>A wild chicken is a non-kosher bird, and does a non-kosher bird impart impurity? Abaye said to them: A great man has stated a matter; do not laugh at him.</b> Rabbi Zeira means that this is referring <b>to a chicken that rebelled</b> against its owner, ran away to the wild, and raised its kosher chicks there. One of those chicks subsequently returned from the wild. Consequently, it had not been present before the Sages while it was alive. <b>And what</b> did Rabbi Zeira mean when he mentioned <b>a wild [<i>bara</i>]</b> chicken? He meant one <b>that was created [<i>de’ivrai</i>] from</b> a chicken <b>that rebelled.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa stated</b> an alternative interpretation: <b>It was a marsh [<i>de’agma</i>] hen.</b> Since no one lives in a marsh, there was no opportunity for intent while it was alive, and therefore intent was necessary afterward. The Gemara adds: <b>Rav Pappa</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning</b> in this regard, <b>as Rav Pappa said:</b> The animal called <b>the marsh rooster is prohibited,</b> as it is a non-kosher bird, whereas <b>the marsh hen is</b> kosher and <b>permitted.</b>
<b>And your mnemonic</b> to remember which animal is permitted and which is prohibited is the well-known statement of the Sages with regard to the verse: “An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 23:4). <b>An Ammonite</b> man is unfit to enter the assembly <b>but not an Ammonite woman.</b> Here too, the animal with a female name is permitted, whereas the one with a male name is prohibited. <b>Mareimar taught: The marsh hen is prohibited,</b> contrary to the opinion of Rav Pappa, as <b>the Sages saw that it mauled and ate</b> its prey. <b>And this is</b> the <b><i>geiruta</i>,</b> a non-kosher bird.
§ Apropos the case of a young kosher bird that fell and died, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A young</b> kosher <b>bird that fell into a winepress</b> and died there, <b>where</b> the owner <b>intended to draw it up</b> from the press <b>for a Samaritan</b> to eat, is <b>ritually impure,</b> like any carcass of a kosher bird. If he intended to draw it up from the press <b>for a dog</b> to eat, it is <b>ritually pure. Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says: Even</b> if he intended to draw it up from the press <b>for a dog</b> to eat, it is <b>impure,</b> as the bird does not require intent for it to be impure.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says</b> in explanation of his opinion: This <i>halakha</i> can be derived by the following <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If</b> the carcass of a kosher bird <b>transmits severe</b> ritual <b>impurity,</b> i.e., it renders one’s garments impure when an olive-bulk of it is in the throat, <b>without thought,</b> i.e., even if no one had intent that a person should eat it, should it <b>not transmit a lenient impurity</b> of food, by touch alone, likewise <b>without thought?</b>
The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri: <b>No,</b> this is not a valid <i>a fortiori</i> inference. <b>If you said</b> that there is no requirement of intent <b>with regard to severe</b> ritual <b>impurity, that</b> is because severe ritual impurity <b>does not assume</b> its status <b>with that</b> requirement of thought, i.e., intent is not relevant to that type of impurity. <b>Shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that there is no requirement of thought <b>with regard to lenient impurity, which does assume</b> its status <b>with that</b> requirement of thought? The Gemara will soon explain the precise meaning of this concept of assuming its status with the requirement of thought.
Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri <b>said to</b> the Rabbis: The case of the <b>chicken in Yavne can prove</b> that the question of whether or not intent is required does not depend on that factor. The case in Yavne involved an item <b>that does assume</b> its status <b>with that</b> requirement of thought, <b>and</b> yet the Sages <b>declared it impure without intent.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri: Will you cite <b>proof from there?</b> In that case <b>there were Samaritans there, and</b> the people in Yavne <b>intended that it be eaten</b> by the Samaritans.
The Gemara analyzes the case of a young kosher bird that fell into a winepress: <b>What</b> type of situation <b>are we dealing with? If we say</b> that we are dealing <b>with cities,</b> where there are many people available to consume all sorts of food, including the carcass of a kosher bird, <b>why does it</b> require <b>intent? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 3:3): <b>An unslaughtered carcass of a kosher animal in any location,</b> whether the population is large or small, <b>and the carcass of a kosher bird or the fat</b> of a kosher animal found <b>in cities [<i>bakerakim</i>], require neither intent</b> for human consumption <b>nor</b> contact with liquid for them to be rendered <b>susceptible</b> to impurity?
<b>Rather,</b> it must be referring <b>to villages,</b> where the population is small and there are not many people who would eat the carcass. <b>But</b> this too is difficult: <b>Is there anyone who said that intent is not required</b> in the case of a carcass of a non-kosher bird for the impurity of food? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in the beginning of that same mishna: <b>A carcass of a non-kosher animal</b> found <b>in any location, and an unslaughtered carcass of a kosher bird in the villages</b> both <b>require intent</b> to consume them, <b>but they do not require</b> contact with a liquid to become <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity?
<b>Rabbi Zeira bar Ḥanina says: Actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case that occurred <b>in a city,</b> and even so intent is required. The reason is that the young bird fell into a winepress, <b>and</b> the <b>winepress rendered it disgusting and</b> thereby <b>rendered it like</b> the carcass of a kosher bird in <b>a village,</b> where there are few people who would eat it.
The Gemara analyzes the exchange cited above. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says</b> that this <i>halakha</i> can be derived by <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If</b> the carcass of a kosher bird <b>transmits severe</b> ritual <b>impurity without thought,</b> should it <b>not transmit lenient impurity without thought?</b>
The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri: <b>No,</b> this is not a valid <i>a fortiori</i> inference. <b>If you said</b> so <b>with regard to severe ritual impurity, that</b> is because it <b>does not assume</b> its status <b>with that</b> requirement of thought.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the clause: It <b>does not assume</b> its status <b>with that</b> requirement of thought? In what manner is thought required for the lenient impurity of food it imparts in the case of a bird carcass but not required for the severe impurity it imparts when it is in the throat? <b>Rava said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri: <b>No, if you said</b> that there is no requirement of thought

Daf 51a

<b>in</b> a case of <b>severe</b> ritual <b>impurity,</b> i.e., when the carcass of a kosher bird renders one’s garments impure while it is in his throat, <b>which does not render</b> impure another item <b>similar to it,</b> i.e., a person who is rendered impure by the carcass does not render another man impure; <b>shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that there is no requirement of thought <b>in</b> the case of <b>lenient impurity,</b> i.e., when the carcass transmits impurity as food, <b>which does render</b> impure another item <b>similar to it?</b> Food that became impure transmits impurity to other food, albeit by rabbinic law.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: But in that case, <b>all the more so</b> impurity as food should apply without thought. <b>If severe impurity,</b> i.e., the unique impurity of the carcass of a kosher bird, <b>which is lenient</b> in the sense <b>that it does not render</b> impure another item <b>similar to it,</b> nevertheless <b>imparts impurity without thought,</b> i.e., without one knowing what is in his throat, then with regard to <b>lenient impurity,</b> i.e., the carcass’s impurity as food, <b>which is</b> more <b>severe</b> in the sense <b>that it renders</b> impure another item <b>similar to it, isn’t it logical that it</b> should <b>impart impurity without thought?</b>
<b>Rather, Rav Sheshet said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the Rabbis, who replied to Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, <b>are saying: No, if you said</b> that thought is not required <b>with regard to severe impurity,</b> i.e., the carcass of a kosher bird in the throat, <b>as it does not require</b> contact with a liquid for it to be rendered <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity, <b>shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that thought is not required <b>with regard to lenient impurity,</b> i.e., its impurity as food, <b>where</b> it <b>does require</b> contact with a liquid for it to be rendered <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity?
The Gemara asks: <b>And does</b> the carcass of a kosher bird <b>require</b> contact with a liquid for it to be rendered <b>susceptible</b> to impurity as food? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Three matters were stated with regard to the carcass of a kosher bird:</b> In order for it to be susceptible to impurity as food, it <b>requires</b> a person’s <b>intent</b> to eat it; <b>and it transmits impurity</b> to garments by rendering one who swallows it ritually impure <b>only</b> when an olive-bulk of it is <b>in the throat; and it does not require</b> contact with a liquid for it to be rendered <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity?
The Gemara answers: <b>Although it does not require</b> contact <b>with a creeping animal</b> for it to be rendered <b>susceptible</b> to impurity, i.e., it is inherently impure, nevertheless <b>it does require</b> contact with <b>water</b> or another liquid for it to be rendered <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about being rendered <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity by contact with <b>a creeping animal that it does not require</b> this contact? This ruling is <b>in accordance with that which the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught.</b> If so, it should <b>also not require</b> contact with <b>water</b> or another liquid for it to be rendered <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity, likewise <b>in accordance with that which the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught.</b>
<b>As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states that seeds contract impurity from the carcass of a creeping animal only if they first come into contact with water: “And if any part of their carcass fall <b>upon any sowing seed that is to be sown,</b> it is pure. But if water be put upon the seed, and any part of their carcass fall thereon, it is impure unto you” (Leviticus 11:37–38). This passage teaches that as long as water did not fall on the seeds, they are not susceptible to ritual impurity. This <i>halakha</i> applies to all items similar to seeds.
Accordingly, <b>just as seeds, which will never transmit impurity severe</b> enough to transmit to humans, like any food, <b>require</b> contact with liquid to be rendered <b>susceptible</b> to impurity, <b>so too, all</b> items <b>that will never transmit severe impurity require</b> contact with liquid to be rendered <b>susceptible</b> to impurity. This <b>excludes the carcass of a kosher bird, which will ultimately transmit impurity severe</b> enough to be transmitted to a human, i.e., when it is in his throat, and therefore <b>it does not require</b> contact with liquid for it to be rendered <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity.
<b>Rather, Rava said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Pappa</b> who said: The Rabbis’ rejection of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri’s <i>a fortiori</i> inference is not based on the specific <i>halakha</i> of impurity of food imparted by the carcass of a bird. Rather, they are referring to the fact that <b>in general</b> there is no item under the common <b>name of severe impurity</b> that requires contact with a liquid for it to be rendered susceptible to ritual impurity. By contrast, with regard to the common <b>name of lenient impurity</b> as food, <b>in general</b> the items in this category require contact with a liquid for them to be rendered susceptible to impurity, despite the fact that the particular case of the carcass of a kosher bird is an exception. Therefore, intent is required for lenient impurity even in the case of a carcass of a kosher bird.
§ <b>Rava says: And Rabbi Yoḥanan concedes with regard to</b> the obligation to <b>tithe, that intent</b> while the produce is <b>attached</b> to the ground <b>is considered intent. Rava said: From where do I say</b> that <b>this</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? It is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ma’asrot</i> 3:9) that deals with the obligation to tithe: <b>Savory, hyssop [<i>veha’ezov</i>], and thyme [<i>vehakoranit</i>],</b> i.e., various types of hyssop plants, that were growing <b>in a courtyard,</b> are eaten by some people although they are not specifically intended for human consumption. Therefore, <b>if they were protected</b> by the owners, those owners are <b>obligated</b> to separate tithes from them.
The Gemara clarifies the mishna: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this ruling? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring to a case <b>where one initially planted them for human</b> consumption, does it <b>need to be said</b> that there is an obligation to tithe if they are protected by the owners? It is clear that in such a situation the criteria for the obligation to tithe, i.e., that it is human food which is protected, have been met. <b>Rather,</b> is it <b>not</b> referring to a case <b>where one initially planted them</b> to be fed <b>to an animal,</b> and nevertheless the mishna <b>teaches: If</b> the owner reconsidered their designation and decided to use them for human consumption and <b>they were protected</b> by the owners, the owners are <b>obligated</b> to tithe them. This apparently indicates that intent while the produce is attached to the ground is considered intent.
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> that Rava’s proof is inconclusive, for the following reason: <b>Here we are dealing with a courtyard where</b> these various types of hyssop plants <b>grew by themselves, and</b> where they are <b>unspecified,</b> they are <b>intended for human</b> consumption. Therefore, they meet the first criteria for the obligation to tithe, as they are considered food. <b>And</b> the mishna addresses the second requirement, that the food must be protected, and <b>this</b> is what it <b>is saying: If the courtyard protects its produce,</b> the owners <b>are obligated</b> in tithes, <b>and if not, they are exempt.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi raises</b> a further <b>objection</b> to Rava’s explanation from a mishna (50a): <b>Any</b> food from <b>which</b> one is <b>obligated to</b> separate <b>tithes becomes impure with the ritual impurity of food. But if it is so,</b> as Rava claimed, that intent while the produce is attached to the ground is considered intent with respect to the obligation to tithe, despite the fact that it is not considered intent with regard to impurity, then the mishna’s blanket statement is inaccurate. Rav Ashi elaborates: After all, <b>there are these</b> endives that were initially planted in order to feed to an animal and later the owner reconsidered their designation and decided to use them for human consumption, from <b>which</b> one is <b>obligated to</b> separate <b>tithe, but which do not become impure with the ritual impurity of food.</b>
<b>Rava said</b> in response that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: Any type</b> of food from <b>which</b> one is <b>obligated to</b> separate <b>tithe becomes impure with the ritual impurity of food.</b> In other words, this is referring to types of food, not to all situations. It is possible for a particular circumstance to be an exception to this principle.
The Gemara adds that <b>this too stands to reason,</b> that the mishna is referring only to types of food, not situations, <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause teaches</b> (51b): With regard to <b>any</b> animal from <b>which</b> the owner is <b>obligated to</b> give <b>the first shearing</b> of its wool, he is <b>obligated to</b> have <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood taken from it, i.e., the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw, if it was slaughtered. <b>And there are</b> animals from <b>which</b> one is <b>obligated to</b> have <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood taken from it, <b>but</b> from which he is <b>not obligated to</b> give <b>the first shearing.</b>
<b>And if it is so,</b> that the principles of the mishna are all-inclusive, one can raise the following difficulty: <b>But there is</b> the specific case of <b>an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>],</b> from <b>which</b> one is <b>obligated to</b> give <b>the first shearing, but one is not obligated to</b> have <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood taken from it, as it may not be eaten. This proves that Rava is correct, that the mishna is not referring to all circumstances, but only to general categories.
<b>Ravina said,</b> rejecting this proof: It is possible that the mishna is referring to all circumstances, and as for the difficulty with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>, one can say that in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon exempts the</b> owner of <b>a <i>tereifa</i> from</b> the mitzva of <b>the first shearing.</b>
<b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i> that the mishna is not referring to all circumstances, but only to general categories: With regard to <b>one who declares his vineyard ownerless, and who arose the</b> next <b>morning and picked grapes</b> from the vineyard before anyone else took possession of them, he is <b>obligated in</b> the mitzva of leaving for the poor <b>individual fallen</b> grapes <b>[<i>peret</i>], and in</b> the mitzva of leaving for them <b>incompletely formed clusters</b> of grapes <b>[<i>uve’olelot</i>], and in</b> the mitzva of <b>forgotten</b> clusters, <b>and in <i>pe’a</i>.</b> The Torah includes such cases in the phrase: “Leave them for the poor and for the stranger” (Leviticus 19:10, 23:22), which is written with regard to all these mitzvot. <b>And he is exempt from</b> the obligation to separate <b>the tithe</b> from the grapes. Since the vineyard is ownerless, there is no obligation to tithe the produce.
The Gemara explains the proof: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna (50a): With regard to <b>any</b> produce from <b>which</b> one is <b>obligated to</b> designate <b><i>pe’a</i>,</b> one is likewise <b>obligated to</b> separate <b>tithes? Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> the mishna that Rava is correct in asserting that the mishna <b>is teaching</b> only principles with regard to each <b>type</b> of produce, but there are exceptions in certain circumstances? The Gemara answers that one should in fact <b>conclude from</b> the mishna that Rava is correct.
§ With regard to the obligations of <i>pe’a</i> and tithes, the Gemara notes that <b>we learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Pe’a</i> 3:2): The Rabbis and Rabbi Akiva disagree with regard to a case where one harvested several separate patches in a field. Rabbi Akiva rules that each patch requires its own <i>pe’a</i>, whereas the Rabbis maintain that one <i>pe’a</i> is required for all of the patches. Nevertheless, <b>the Rabbis concede to Rabbi Akiva in</b> the case of <b>one who sows dill or mustard in two or three</b> separate <b>locations</b> in a single field, <b>that he leaves <i>pe’a</i> for each and every one</b> of these plots on its own, rather than one corner for all of them.

Daf 51b

The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>dill,</b> from <b>which</b> one is <b>obligated to</b> designate <b><i>pe’a</i>,</b> as stated in the mishna, one must also <b>be obligated to</b> separate <b>tithe,</b> since if the obligation of <i>pe’a</i> applies then the obligation of tithes likewise applies. <b>As we learned</b> in the mishna (50a): With regard to <b>any</b> produce from <b>which</b> one is <b>obligated to</b> designate <b><i>pe’a</i>,</b> one is likewise <b>obligated to</b> separate <b>tithe.</b>
<b>And from</b> the fact that with regard to dill one is <b>obligated to</b> separate <b>tithe,</b> it follows that it <b>becomes impure with the ritual impurity of food.</b> As the mishna on 50a states: Any food that is obligated in tithes becomes impure with the ritual impurity of food. <b>Apparently, any item that is prepared</b> in order <b>to</b> add <b>taste</b> to food, such as dill, <b>becomes impure with the ritual impurity of food, as this dill is prepared</b> in order <b>to</b> add <b>taste</b> to food.
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to this conclusion from a mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 3:5), which deals with the ritual impurity of food: With regard to spices such as <b>costus, amomum, chief spices, root of crowfoot, asafoetida, peppers, and a cake of safflower,</b> although their function is merely to add taste to food, they are considered food for the purposes of the following <i>halakha</i>: They <b>may be bought with</b> second-<b>tithe money,</b> which must be taken to Jerusalem and used to purchase food. <b>But</b> they are not considered food insofar as <b>they do not become impure with the ritual impurity of food.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri said to</b> Rabbi Akiva: <b>If</b> they are considered food to the extent that <b>they may be bought with</b> second-<b>tithe money, for what</b> reason are <b>they not</b> considered food in terms of <b>becoming impure with the ritual impurity of food? And if they do not become impure</b> with the ritual impurity of food because they are not considered food, then <b>they should also not be bought with</b> second-<b>tithe money.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri said</b> with regard to this <i>halakha</i>: <b>They counted</b> the opinions of the Sages, <b>and they concluded that</b> these spices <b>may not be bought with</b> second-<b>tithe money, and</b> they do <b>not become impure</b> with the ritual <b>impurity of food.</b> This apparently contradicts the previous claim that dill, which is a spice, becomes impure with the ritual impurity of food.
<b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> the following resolution of the difficulty: <b>When that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which indicates that dill is considered food and can contract the impurity of food, <b>is taught,</b> it is referring <b>to dill that is prepared for a spice dish [<i>likhmakh</i>],</b> i.e., to be ground and placed in a Babylonian spice, <i>kutaḥ</i>, which is used as a dip.
<b>Rav Ashi said: I said this <i>halakha</i> of</b> Rav Ḥisda’s <b>before Rav Kahana,</b> and he commented: <b>Do not say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring specifically to a case <b>where</b> the <b>dill</b> was prepared <b>for a spice dish</b> from the outset, which would indicate that if dill is <b>undesignated</b> then it is intended to be an ingredient <b>in a pot</b> of food. <b>Rather, undesignated dill</b> is also <b>prepared for a spice dish. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 3:4): With regard to <i>teruma</i> <b>dill, once it imparted flavor in a pot</b> of food and was removed from the pot, it <b>is no</b> longer <b>subject to</b> the prohibition of a non-priest partaking of <b><i>teruma</i>, and it can no</b> longer <b>become impure with the ritual impurity of food.</b>
Rav Kahana explains the proof: It can be inferred from this mishna that <b>until</b> the dill has <b>imparted flavor in a pot</b> of food it <b>is subject to</b> the prohibition of a non-priest partaking of <b><i>teruma</i>, and it can become impure with the ritual impurity of food. And if</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> that <b>undesignated</b> dill is intended as an ingredient <b>in a pot</b> of food, then <b>even when</b> one did <b>not place</b> the dill in a pot, the same <i>halakha</i> with respect to <i>teruma</i> and impurity should apply, as when it is <b>undesignated</b> the dill is intended as an ingredient <b>in a pot</b> of food. <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> the mishna that <b>undesignated</b> dill is <b>prepared for a spice dish?</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from</b> the mishna that this is the case.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>any</b> animal, i.e., sheep and rams, from <b>which one is obligated</b> by Torah law (see Deuteronomy 18:4) <b>to</b> give <b>the first shearing</b> of its wool to a priest, he <b>is obligated to</b> have <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood, i.e., the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw, which must be removed from slaughtered animals, taken from it (see Deuteronomy 18:3). <b>And there are</b> animals from <b>which one is obligated to</b> have <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood taken from them, e.g., cattle and goats, <b>but</b> from which <b>he is not obligated to</b> give <b>the first shearing.</b>
The mishna teaches a similar principle: For <b>all</b> Sabbatical-Year produce <b>to which there</b> applies the obligation of <b>eradication</b> from the house when it ceases to be available to the animals in the field, <b>there is</b> the sanctity of <b>Sabbatical-</b>Year produce upon <b>it,</b> i.e., it may not be used for commerce and is ownerless while it is attached to the ground. <b>And there</b> is produce <b>for which there is</b> the sanctity of <b>Sabbatical-</b>Year produce, <b>but for</b> which <b>there is no</b> obligation of <b>eradication</b> from the house, e.g., produce that is preserved in the ground and does not cease to be available in the field.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the sanctity of Sabbatical-Year produce applies to any produce upon which there is an obligation of eradication, but the converse is not necessarily the case. The Gemara cites an example of plants whose various parts illustrate these <i>halakhot</i>: Plants <b>such as the wild arum leaf and the ceterach,</b> which cease to be available in the field during the rainy season, are subject to eradication and to the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year. Examples of the second <i>halakha</i> of the mishna, that <b>there is</b> produce <b>for which there is</b> the sanctity of <b>Sabbatical-</b>Year produce <b>but</b> for which <b>there is no</b> obligation of <b>eradication</b> from the house, include the <b>root of the wild arum and the root of the ceterach.</b>
The Gemara explains <b>that it is written</b> in connection to the Sabbatical Year: <b>“And for the cattle and the beasts that are in your land, all its produce may be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 25:7), from which it is derived: <b>As long as the undomesticated animals eat</b> a type of produce <b>from the field, you may feed</b> that type of produce <b>to your domesticated animal in the house,</b> as it still remains in the field. But if that type of produce <b>has ceased for the undomesticated animals in the field, you must cease</b> feeding it <b>to your domesticated animal in the house.</b> This is the obligation of eradication. <b>And these,</b> the root of the wild arum and the ceterach, <b>have not ceased for undomesticated animals</b> in the field, and therefore there is no obligation of eradication.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> It is written: “Whatever has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, you may eat them” (Leviticus 11:9). There is a principle with regard to the signs indicating that fish are kosher: <b>Any</b> fish <b>that has scales has fins; and there are</b> fish <b>that have fins but do not have scales.</b> Similarly, with regard to kosher animals it is written: “Whatever parts the hoof, and is wholly cloven-footed, and chews the cud, among the beasts, that you may eat” (Leviticus 11:3). <b>Any</b> animal <b>that has horns has hooves; and there are</b> animals <b>that have hooves but do not have horns.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that <b>any</b> fish <b>that has scales</b> also has fins and therefore is <b>a kosher fish.</b> The mishna also stated that <b>there are</b> fish <b>that have fins but do not have scales.</b> Such a fish is <b>a non-kosher fish.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Since we rely</b> exclusively <b>upon</b> the sign of the <b>scales,</b> as a fish that has scales necessarily has fins as well, <b>why do I</b> need the sign of <b>fins that the Merciful One writes</b> in the Torah as one of the criteria of kosher fish?
The Gemara answers: <b>If the Merciful One</b> had <b>not</b> also <b>written</b> the sign of <b>fins</b> in the Torah, <b>I would say: What</b> does the word <b><i>kaskeset</i>,</b> scales, <b>that is written</b> in the Torah mean? It does not mean scales, but <b>fins. And</b> I would therefore say that <b>even a non-kosher fish,</b> which has fins but no scales, is permitted. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes</b> both signs, <b>fins and scales.</b>
The Gemara further asks: <b>But now that the Merciful One wrote</b> in the Torah <b>fins and <i>kaskeset</i>, from where do we</b> derive that <b><i>kaskeset</i></b> denotes <b>clothing,</b> i.e., scales, rather than fins? The Gemara answers: We derive it from a verse, <b>as it is written</b> about Goliath the Philistine: <b>“And he was clad with a coat of mail [<i>kaskasim</i>]”</b> (I Samuel 17:5).
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if there is proof that <i>kaskeset</i> means scales, the question returns: <b>Let the Merciful One write</b> only <b>“scales” and</b> then there would be <b>no need</b> to write <b>“fins.” Rabbi Abbahu says, and likewise</b> a Sage of <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught,</b> that this is in accordance with the verse: “The Lord was pleased, for His righteousness’ sake, <b>to make Torah great and glorious”</b> (Isaiah 42:21).In this context, this means that it is fitting for the Torah to state all the characteristics of a kosher animal rather than merely state that which is absolutely necessary.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> This mishna teaches a generalization that is similar to the previous ones: <b>Anything that requires a blessing after</b> one partakes of <b>it requires a blessing beforehand. And there exist</b> items <b>that require a blessing before but</b> do <b>not require a blessing thereafter.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that there are items that require a blessing before but not after. The Gemara inquires: <b>What</b> case does this <i>halakha</i> in the mishna <b>add?</b> The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to add</b> the case of <b>vegetables,</b> as one recites a blessing before eating them but not afterward. The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, who</b> maintains that one <b>recites a blessing on vegetables</b> after eating them, <b>what</b> case does this <i>halakha</i> in the mishna <b>add?</b> The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to add</b> the case of <b>water,</b> as one recites a blessing before drinking it but not afterward.
The Gemara further asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Pappa, who</b> rules that <b>one recites a blessing on water</b> after drinking it, <b>what</b> case does this <i>halakha</i> in the mishna serve <b>to add?</b> The Gemara answers that the mishna, which does not explicitly mention food, serves <b>to add mitzvot.</b> In other words, one recites a blessing before performing a mitzva, e.g., wearing ritual fringes or taking the <i>lulav</i> and the like, but one does not recite a blessing after its fulfillment. The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the <b>residents of the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>who recite</b> the following <b>blessing after they remove their phylacteries: Who sanctified us with His mitzvot and commanded us to keep His laws, what</b> does this <i>halakha</i> in the mishna <b>come to add?</b> The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to add</b> the case of

Daf 52a

fragrant <b>spices.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A young girl who</b> reached the age of puberty and <b>grew two</b> pubic <b>hairs</b> is an adult. If her childless husband dies, <b>she either performs <i>ḥalitza</i></b> and is thereby permitted to marry anyone, <b>or enters into levirate marriage</b> with her husband’s brother. <b>And</b> furthermore, such a girl is <b>obligated to</b> fulfill <b>all the mitzvot stated in the Torah</b> in which women are obligated.
<b>And likewise, a young boy who</b> reached the age of puberty and <b>grew two</b> pubic <b>hairs</b> is an adult and is <b>obligated to</b> fulfill <b>all the mitzvot stated in the Torah. And he is fit to be</b> declared <b>a stubborn and rebellious son</b> if he performs the actions that warrant that designation, <b>from when he grows two</b> pubic <b>hairs until</b> his <b>beard will form a circle.</b> During that period, although he is an adult and punishable for his actions, he is incapable of fathering a child. Consequently, as he is a son and not a father, he can be designated a stubborn and rebellious son.
The mishna explains that the reference is to <b>the lower,</b> pubic, hair, <b>and not to the upper,</b> facial, hair. <b>But</b> the term beard is used, despite its being subject to misinterpretation, due to the fact <b>that the Sages spoke euphemistically.</b>
<b>A young girl who</b> reached the age of puberty and <b>grew two</b> pubic <b>hairs can no</b> longer <b>perform refusal</b> to end a marriage with a husband to whom she was married as a minor by her mother and brothers after her father’s death. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> She retains the right to perform refusal <b>until</b> the pubic hair will grow to the extent <b>that the black</b> hair <b>will be preponderant</b> in the pubic area.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But since we learned</b> in the mishna that a young girl who reached the age of puberty and grew two pubic hairs is considered an adult and is <b>obligated to</b> fulfill <b>all the mitzvot stated in the Torah, why do I</b> need the mishna to also teach: <b>She either performs <i>ḥalitza</i> or enters into levirate marriage.</b> These specific examples are included in the broader statement.
The Gemara explains: This emphasis serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei, who said: Man,</b> i.e., an adult man, <b>is written in the passage</b> of <i>ḥalitza</i>: “And if the man does not wish to take his brother’s wife” (Deuteronomy 25:7). <b>But</b> with regard to the <b>woman, whether</b> she is <b>an adult or whether</b> she is <b>a minor,</b> she can be released by <i>ḥalitza</i>, as the Torah does not specify her age. The mishna <b>teaches us that</b> the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei. Rather, <b>if</b> she <b>grew two</b> pubic <b>hairs,</b> then <b>yes,</b> she can perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, whereas <b>if</b> she did <b>not</b> grow two hairs, she may <b>not</b> perform <i>ḥalitza</i> or enter into levirate marriage. <b>What is the reason</b> for this ruling? It is that the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>woman</b> is <b>like</b> that of the <b>man,</b> as a woman is juxtaposed to man in this passage.
The Gemara asks further: <b>And since we learned</b> in the continuation of the mishna: <b>And likewise, a young boy who</b> reached the age of puberty and <b>grew two</b> pubic <b>hairs</b> is an adult, <b>why do I</b> need the mishna to add explicitly: Is <b>obligated to</b> fulfill <b>all the mitzvot stated in the Torah?</b>
<b>And if you would say</b> that the mishna specified this <b>because</b> it <b>wanted to teach</b> the particular <i>halakha</i>: <b>And he is fit to be</b> declared <b>a stubborn and rebellious son,</b> that cannot be the reason, as <b>we</b> already <b>learned</b> that <b><i>halakha</i></b> on <b>another occasion</b> in a mishna (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 68b): <b>When</b> is such a boy liable to receive the death penalty imposed upon <b>a stubborn and rebellious son? From when he grows two</b> pubic <b>hairs until</b> his <b>beard will form a circle.</b> The reference is to <b>the lower,</b> pubic, hair <b>and not to the upper,</b> facial hair, <b>but</b> the term beard is used, due to the fact <b>that the Sages spoke euphemistically.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> it <b>is indeed so,</b> i.e., it is not necessary for the mishna to specify with regard to a boy that he is obligated to fulfill all the mitzvot stated in the Torah. <b>But since</b> the mishna <b>specified</b> this <b>matter</b> in the case <b>of a young girl,</b> it <b>also specified</b> this <b>matter</b> in the case <b>of a young boy.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>A young girl who</b> reached the age of puberty and <b>grew</b> two pubic hairs can no longer perform refusal to end a marriage with a husband to whom she was married as a minor by her mother and brothers after her father’s death. Rabbi Yehuda maintains that she retains the right of refusal until the pubic hair grows to the extent that the black hair is preponderant in the pubic area. <b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yehuda concedes</b> to the Rabbis <b>that if she engaged in intercourse</b> with her husband <b>after she grew two</b> pubic <b>hairs,</b> she <b>can no longer perform refusal.</b> This is because the act of intercourse renders her betrothed to him by Torah law, and refusal is a rabbinic enactment that is effective only with regard to a betrothal that applies by rabbinic law.
<b>Rav Kahana’s colleagues thought to perform an action in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> in the mishna, <b>and</b> to permit a young girl who had grown two pubic hairs to perform refusal, <b>even though she</b> had <b>engaged in intercourse</b> with her husband after growing two hairs. They held that until the pubic hair grows to the extent that the black hair is preponderant in the pubic area, her betrothal does not apply by Torah law.
<b>Rav Kahana said to</b> his colleagues: <b>Didn’t the incident involving Rabbi Yishmael’s daughter,</b> who was married as a minor by her mother and brothers after her father’s death, transpire <b>in that manner? As she came to the study hall to refuse</b> her marriage, <b>and her son was riding on her shoulders. And on that</b> very <b>day, Rabbi Yishmael’s statement,</b> that a young girl may perform refusal even if she engaged in intercourse with her husband after growing two hairs, <b>was mentioned in the study hall. And she cried</b> with <b>a great weeping in the study hall,</b> as a result of the incident.
The Sages who were in the study hall <b>said:</b> Could it be that with regard to <b>a matter that that righteous</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>said,</b> i.e., that she can perform refusal, <b>his offspring would stumble upon it?</b> The consequence of her refusal is that she is considered to have borne the child retroactively out of wedlock.
<b>As Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel says in the name of Rabbi Yishmael:</b> The verse states with regard to a <i>sota</i>: <b>“And neither was she taken”</b> (Numbers 5:13), i.e., raped. In this case <b>she is prohibited</b> to her husband. It may be inferred that if she <b>was taken</b> forcefully <b>she is permitted</b> to her husband. <b>And there is</b> a case of <b>another</b> woman <b>where, even though she was not taken</b> forcefully, but was willing, she nevertheless remains <b>permitted. And which</b> case <b>is this?</b> This is referring to one <b>whose betrothal</b> was <b>a mistaken betrothal, as, even if her son</b> from this marriage <b>is riding on her shoulders she may perform refusal and go</b> off as pleases <b>her.</b> Although she engaged in intercourse with her husband after growing two pubic hairs, she was relying on the original betrothal, which was a mistaken betrothal, and did not intend to become betrothed to him by means of this intercourse, which would have rendered her betrothed by Torah law. She may therefore nullify the betrothal by means of refusal.
<b>And</b> the Gemara relates that as a result of the event involving Rabbi Yishmael’s daughter, the Sages assembled, <b>counted</b> the votes, <b>and concluded: Until when may</b> a young <b>girl perform refusal? Until</b> she <b>grows two</b> pubic <b>hairs.</b> Once Rav Kahana’s colleagues heard this, they <b>retracted</b> and <b>did not perform an action</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda in the mishna, to permit the girl to perform refusal as they had originally planned.
The Gemara further relates that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak and the disciples of Rabbi Ḥanina performed an action in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> in the mishna, <b>and</b> permitted a young girl who had grown two pubic hairs to perform refusal, <b>even though she</b> had <b>engaged in intercourse</b> with her husband after growing two hairs. <b>Rav Shemen bar Abba</b> subsequently <b>went</b> and <b>stated</b> this story <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> and <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan went</b> and <b>stated it before Rabbi Yehuda Nesia.</b> Rabbi Yehuda Nesia <b>sent a constable [<i>ballasha</i>] and removed</b> that girl from her second husband.
With regard to Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion, that the black hair must be preponderant in the pubic area, <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Mar Ukva says:</b> This does <b>not</b> mean <b>that</b> the <b>black</b> hair must <b>literally be preponderant</b> in the pubic area. <b>Rather, there must be two hairs lying down, so that it appears as though the black</b> hairs in the pubic area cover an area <b>greater than the white</b> area uncovered by hair. <b>Rava says:</b> Rabbi Yehuda means that there are <b>two hairs that surround</b> the pubic area <b>from end to end.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that the growth of two hairs is a sign of becoming an adult. The Gemara clarifies the details of this <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rabbi Ḥelbo says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says:</b> These <b>two hairs that</b> the Sages <b>said</b> are a sign of adulthood <b>must have follicles at their roots. Rav Malkiyyu says</b> that <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava</b> says: If there are two <b>follicles</b> next to each other, they constitute a sign of adulthood <b>even if there are no hairs</b> in them. The assumption is that follicles do not exist without hair, and therefore there must have been hairs there that fell out.
This <i>halakha</i> was stated by a Sage by the name of Rav Malkiyyu. To prevent confusion between his rulings and those of the similarly named Rav Malkiyya, <b>Rabbi Ḥanina, son of Rav Ika, says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> involving <b>a skewer,</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>maidservants, and</b> the <i>halakha</i> involving hair <b>follicles</b> were all stated by <b>Rav Malkiyyu.</b> By contrast, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>forelock [<i>belorit</i>],</b> the <i>halakha</i> involving <b>burnt ashes, and</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>cheese</b> were all stated by a different Sage named <b>Rav Malkiyya.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa says:</b> The aforementioned <i>halakhot</i> that relate to <b>a mishna or a <i>baraita</i></b> were stated by <b>Rav Malkiyya,</b> whereas <b><i>halakhot</i></b> that do not refer to a mishna or <i>baraita</i> but are independent statements of <i>amora’im</i> were taught by <b>Rav Malkiyyu. And a mnemonic</b> to remember this is: <b>The mishna is a queen [<i>malketa</i>],</b> i.e., the comments that are referring to a mishna were issued by Rav Malkiyya, whose name is similar to the Aramaic term for queen.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between</b> the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina, son of Rav Ika, and Rav Pappa? The Gemara answers: The difference <b>between them</b> is with regard to which Sage taught the <i>halakha</i> involving <b>maidservants.</b> Rav Pappa maintains that it was taught by Rav Malkiyya, as it is referring to a dispute in a mishna. By contrast, according to Rabbi Ḥanina, this <i>halakha</i> was stated by Rav Malkiyyu.
With regard to the <i>halakha</i> of Rav Malkiyyu itself, concerning follicles, <b>Rav Ashi says: Mar Zutra told me</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina of Sura</b> posed the following <b>difficulty:</b> If it is correct that follicles suffice as a sign of adulthood, <b>let</b> the <b><i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna <b>not evade</b> the issue, <b>but</b> rather let him <b>teach us</b> explicitly that <b>follicles</b> are a sign of adulthood even if they do not contain hair. The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> the mishna had <b>taught us</b> the case of <b>follicles, I would say</b> that they are not considered a sign of adulthood <b>until there are two hairs in two follicles.</b> By omitting any mention of follicles in the mishna, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us that even two hairs in one follicle</b> are a sign of adulthood.
The Gemara asks: <b>And is there</b> actually <b>a case like this,</b> of two hairs in one follicle? <b>But isn’t it written: “He crushes me with a tempest, and multiplies my wounds without cause”</b> (Job 9:17); <b>and Rava said</b> with regard to this verse: <b>Job blasphemed with a tempest,</b> and <b>with a tempest he was answered. He blasphemed with a tempest,</b> as Job <b>said before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, perhaps a tempest passed before You and You confused Iyyov,</b> Job, <b>with <i>oyev</i>,</b> enemy. <b>With a tempest he was answered,</b> as the verse states: <b>“Then the Lord answered</b>

Daf 52b

<b>Job out of the tempest, and said”</b> (Job 38:1–3) <b>to him:</b> Greatest <b>imbecile in the world! I have created many hairs on a person’s head, and for each and every hair I created</b> its own <b>distinct follicle, so that two hairs should not draw</b> sustenance <b>from one follicle. As, were two</b> hairs <b>to draw</b> sustenance <b>from one follicle,</b> it would <b>weaken a man’s vision.</b> Now if <b>I did not confuse one follicle with another, would I confuse</b> a man named <b>Iyyov with <i>oyev</i>?</b> This indicates that two hairs do not grow from one follicle.
The Gemara answers: It is <b>not difficult; that</b> statement above, that two hairs in one follicle is a valid sign of adulthood, is referring to the hairs <b>in</b> the rest of a person’s <b>body,</b> whereas <b>this</b> statement, that there cannot be two hairs in one follicle, is referring to the hairs <b>on</b> a person’s <b>head.</b>
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b>two hairs that</b> the Sages <b>said</b> are signs of adulthood are valid signs <b>even if</b> they are not adjacent; but rather <b>one</b> hair is <b>on the spoon-</b>shaped area above his organ <b>and one</b> is <b>on the</b> young boy’s <b>testicles.</b>
The Gemara notes <b>that</b> this <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>two hairs that</b> the Sages <b>said</b> are signs of adulthood are valid signs <b>even</b> if <b>one</b> hair is <b>on</b> the young girl’s <b>back,</b> below her pubic area, <b>and one on her lower abdomen.</b> The same applies if <b>one</b> hair is <b>on the finger joints of her hand and one</b> hair is <b>on the toe joints of her foot.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda, of the village of Akko, who said</b> it <b>in the name of Rabbi Shimon. And</b> what do <b>the Rabbis</b> say about this matter? <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> According to the Rabbis, they are not a valid sign of adulthood <b>unless</b> the <b>two hairs are in one place.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis disagree with regard to when a young girl can perform refusal. According to the Rabbis, it is until she grows two pubic hairs after she reaches the age of twelve years and one day. According to Rabbi Yehuda she still retains the right to perform refusal at that point, until the majority of the pubic area is filled with hair. In this regard, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Until when can a young girl perform refusal? Until she grows two</b> pubic <b>hairs;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> She can perform refusal <b>until</b> the area covered by the <b>black</b> pubic hairs <b>is greater</b> than the white skin of the genital area. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Until the nipple is surrounded</b> by hair. <b>Ben Shelakot says: Until</b> the pubic area is <b>filled with hair.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Shimon said: Ḥanina ben Ḥakhinai found me in</b> the city of <b>Tzaidan and said</b> to me: <b>When you reach Rabbi Akiva, say to him: Until when can a young girl perform refusal? If he says to you</b> that she may perform refusal <b>until she grows two</b> pubic <b>hairs, say to him: But didn’t ben Shelakot testify in the presence of all of you in Yavne</b> that she may perform refusal <b>until</b> the pubic area <b>is filled with hair [<i>shetekhalkel</i>], and you did not say anything to him,</b> thereby indicating that you conceded to him?
Rabbi Shimon continued: <b>When I reached Rabbi Akiva,</b> and I said what I had been told to say to him, <b>he said to me: I do not know what this filling with hair [<i>kilkul</i>] is, I don’t know</b> any <b>ben Shelakot,</b> and my opinion with regard to your question, <b>until when can a young girl perform refusal,</b> is that she can perform refusal <b>until she grows two</b> pubic <b>hairs.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The <b>two</b> white or black <b>hairs that are mentioned with regard to</b> disqualification of a red <b>heifer; and</b> the two white hairs mentioned <b>with regard to leprous marks,</b> i.e., that if they grow within a white leprous mark, it is impure; <b>and</b> the two hairs <b>that are mentioned in every place,</b> i.e., with regard to a young boy and girl, are significant only if they are long <b>enough to bend the top</b> of the hairs <b>to</b> reach <b>their roots.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> They must be long <b>enough to</b> grasp them and <b>cut</b> them <b>with a fingernail. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> They must be long <b>enough to be cut with a pair [<i>bezug</i>]</b> of scissors.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Mar Ukva says</b> with regard to the various opinions in the mishna on the measure of hairs: The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with the statements of all of them to be stringent.</b> One should consider it hair only if all of the criteria are met, or consider it to be hair if any one condition is met, depending on which standard yields the more stringent result.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to a woman <b>who sees</b> a red <b>stain</b> on her garment, <b>that</b> woman’s reckoning <b>is distorted.</b> Since she does not know when the blood that caused the stain appeared, she does not know when the seven days of menstrual flow end and when the eleven days of the flow of the <i>zava</i> begin.
<b>And</b> therefore she must be <b>concerned due to</b> the possibility that it might have been caused by the <b>flow of a <i>zava</i>.</b> If she wore the same garment for three days on which she can assume the status of a <i>zava</i>, and subsequently discovered a stain with an area that is the size of at least three split beans, the concern is that on each of those three days a stain with the area of at least one split bean, the minimum area that transmits impurity, was formed. The result is that she is a greater <i>zava</i> and is required to count seven clean days before immersion. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: No</b> configuration <b>of stains</b> leads to concern <b>due to the flow of a <i>zava</i>.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> are <b>the Rabbis</b> in this mishna? <b>It is Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says: Stains do not</b> lead to concern <b>due to the flow of a <i>zava</i>, but stains can sometimes lead to <i>ziva</i>.</b>
<b>How so,</b> i.e., how can stains lead to <i>ziva</i> according to Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus? If a woman <b>wore three</b> different <b>robes that</b> had been <b>examined by her</b> for blood stains, <b>and</b> she then <b>found a stain on</b> each of <b>them; or</b> if she <b>saw</b> blood flowing from her body on <b>two</b> consecutive <b>days and</b> on the third day she saw a stain on <b>one</b> of the <b>robes</b> that she wore that day, <b>those are the stains that lead to <i>ziva</i>.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to the above statement: According to the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus, <b>now</b> that in a case where she sees stains on <b>three robes we</b> are <b>concerned</b> for <i>ziva</i>, despite the fact <b>that</b> she <b>does not see</b> the blood flowing <b>from her body, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state that we are concerned if she experiences bleeding from her body on <b>two days and</b> sees a stain on <b>one</b> of the <b>robes?</b>
The Gemara answers: It is necessary to state that, <b>lest you say</b> that in <b>any case like this,</b> where she experiences bleeding from her body on two days and on the third day she sees a stain on one of the robes, <b>she brings an offering and it is consumed,</b> like one who is definitely a <i>zava</i>. Therefore, Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus <b>teaches us</b> that her status as a <i>zava</i> is uncertain, and consequently she brings a bird for a sin offering that is due to uncertainty, which is not eaten.
<b>Rava said: With this</b> claim <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus bested the</b> other <b>Rabbis,</b> who agree with the opinion of Rabbi Meir in the mishna: <b>What is different</b> about a stain that is <b>less than three split beans in one place, that we are not concerned</b> she might be a <i>zava</i>? The reason is <b>that we say</b> she <b>saw</b> blood <b>on</b> only <b>two days.</b> But in a case where she discovered a stain on her robe with the area of at least <b>three split beans in one place,</b> one can <b>also say:</b> The area of <b>two and a half</b> split beans should be attributed to blood <b>seen from her body, but the other is</b> the <b>blood of a louse that</b> was there <b>due to the dirt</b> associated with her bleeding.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> respond to this claim? The Gemara answers: They maintain that <b>since it is possible to divide</b> the stain into <b>at least one split bean for each</b> of the three <b>days, we do not attribute</b> the stain to the blood of a louse.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to the statement of Rava: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus,</b> one can infer that <b>it is</b> specifically in the case of a stain with the area of at least <b>three split beans in one place that we are not concerned</b> she might be a <i>zava</i>. It can be inferred from here that if it is <b>in three places, we are concerned.</b> But <b>didn’t you say</b> that if she discovered stains <b>in three robes, yes,</b> we are concerned, which indicates that if it is <b>in three places</b> on a single robe we are <b>not</b> concerned.
The Gemara answers that it was <b>in accordance with the statement of the Rabbis</b> that Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>to them,</b> as follows: <b>According to my</b> opinion, if she discovered stains <b>in three robes, yes</b> we are concerned, whereas if it is <b>in three places</b> we are <b>not</b> concerned. <b>But according to your</b> opinion, <b>at least concede to me that where</b> she <b>saw</b> a stain on her robe with the area of at least <b>three split beans in one place, that we say</b> that the area of <b>two and a half</b> split beans can be attributed to blood <b>seen from her body, and the other is</b> the <b>blood of a louse</b> that was there <b>due to the dirt</b> associated with her bleeding.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> respond to this claim? The Gemara answers: They maintain that <b>since it is possible to divide</b> the stain into <b>at least one split bean for each</b> of the three <b>days, we do not attribute</b> the stain to the blood of a louse.
§ With regard to a woman who finds a stain on her robe, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a woman <b>who sees</b> a red <b>stain</b> on her garment that she wore for a number of days and she does not know when and where it is from, what is her status? <b>If</b> the area is large <b>enough to be divided</b> into three parts, where the total area is the size of <b>three split beans,</b> each of <b>which is</b> the minimum measure to render her a <i>zava</i>, i.e., an area the size of <b>at least a split bean,</b> she must be <b>concerned</b> that she is a <i>zava</i>, as this stain might be the result of seeing a sufficient measure of blood on each of three occasions. <b>But if</b> the stain is <b>not</b> that size, she does <b>not</b> need to <b>be concerned.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Agra says in the name of Rabbi Yosei: Both</b> in <b>this</b> case, where she saw a stain large enough to be divided into three parts, where the total area is the size of three split beans, <b>and that</b> case, where the stain was not that large, she must be <b>concerned</b> that she might be a <i>zava</i>. This is due to the fact that she possibly saw stains of sufficient size on only two occasions, but one was during twilight, which counts as two days, amounting to a total of three days.

Daf 53a

<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda ben Agra and the Rabbis should be decided as follows: <b>The statement of Rabbi Yehuda ben Agra,</b> who maintains that there is a concern for the possibility that the woman might have seen blood at twilight, <b>appears</b> to be correct <b>in</b> a case <b>where she did not examine. And the statement of the Rabbis,</b> who are not concerned about that possibility, appears to be correct <b>in</b> a case <b>where she did examine.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> did Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi mean by: Where she <b>did examine, and what</b> did he mean by: Where she <b>did not examine? Rava says: I found the Sages in the study hall of Rav sitting and saying</b> the following explanation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the woman <b>examined herself but did not examine her robe. And even</b> with regard to <b>herself, she examined</b> herself <b>only</b> during <b>twilight [<i>bein hashemashot</i>]</b> as defined <b>by Rabbi Yehuda,</b> i.e., the time it takes to walk a half <i>mil</i> before the emergence of the stars. <b>But during twilight</b> as defined <b>by Rabbi Yosei,</b> i.e., the blink of an eye before the emergence of the stars, <b>she did not examine</b> herself.
<b>As the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>during</b> the period of <b>twilight</b> as defined <b>by Rabbi Yosei it is</b> already <b>night,</b> and therefore it does not matter that she did not examine herself then. <b>And</b> as <b>she did examine</b> herself <b>during</b> the period of <b>twilight</b> as defined <b>by Rabbi Yehuda,</b> and she found no blood, there is no concern that she saw during twilight, which would count as two sightings. <b>And Rabbi Yosei</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as</b> Rabbi Yosei, in whose name Rabbi Yehuda ben Agra said his ruling, <b>stated</b> that the time that he defines as <b>twilight is</b> considered <b>uncertain,</b> i.e., it is not definitely night or day, and therefore there is a concern that she might have seen blood at that time, which would count as seeing twice.
Rava continues: <b>And I said to</b> those Sages: <b>Had</b> the woman’s <b>hands</b> been <b>in her eyes,</b> a euphemism for her private parts, for <b>the entire twilight</b> period, what <b>you say</b> would be <b>fine.</b> But <b>now</b> that this is not the case, <b>perhaps when she removed her hands</b> from examining herself <b>she saw</b> blood. <b>And</b> those Sages <b>said to me:</b> The case about which <b>we said</b> that opinion <b>was where she placed her hands in her eyes</b> for <b>the entire twilight</b> period.
The Gemara further clarifies the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: The statement of Rabbi Yehuda ben Agra</b> in the name of Rabbi Yosei, who maintains that one needs to be concerned for the possibility that the woman saw blood at twilight, which would count as though she saw blood twice, <b>appears</b> to be correct <b>in</b> a case <b>where she did not examine.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by: Where she did <b>not examine?</b>
<b>If we say that she examined</b> herself <b>during</b> the period <b>that is</b> defined by <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> as twilight, <b>but</b> she <b>did not examine</b> herself <b>during</b> the time period <b>that is</b> defined by <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> as twilight, this is difficult: If Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi accepted the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda ben Agra only in such a case, this indicates, <b>by inference, that Rabbi Yehuda</b> ben Agra himself, whose ruling is more strict than that of the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>even though</b> she <b>examined</b> herself <b>during</b> the twilight period as defined by <b>both</b> Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei, <b>she must be concerned.</b> This conclusion is untenable, as <b>she examined</b> herself throughout twilight and there was no blood.
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that when Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi referred to a case where she did not examine herself, he meant <b>that she examined</b> herself <b>neither during</b> the period <b>that Rabbi Yehuda</b> defines as twilight, <b>nor during</b> the period <b>that Rabbi Yosei</b> defines as twilight. <b>But</b> if she <b>examined</b> herself <b>during</b> the period <b>that Rabbi Yehuda</b> defines as twilight, <b>but</b> she <b>did not examine</b> herself <b>during</b> the period <b>that Rabbi Yosei</b> defines as twilight, then she does <b>not</b> need to be <b>concerned.</b>
<b>Evidently,</b> the time period <b>that Rabbi Yosei</b> defines as <b>twilight is</b> considered <b>nighttime</b> according <b>to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. But if so, <b>say the latter clause: And the statement of the Rabbis</b> appears to be correct <b>in</b> a case <b>where she did examine. What</b> is meant by: Where she did <b>examine?</b>
<b>If we say that she examined</b> herself <b>during</b> the period <b>that is</b> defined <b>by Rabbi Yehuda</b> as twilight, <b>but</b> she <b>did not examine</b> herself <b>during</b> the period <b>that is</b> defined <b>by Rabbi Yosei</b> as twilight, this is difficult: If Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi accepted the opinion of the Rabbis only in such a case, this indicates <b>by inference that the Rabbis</b> themselves <b>hold</b> that <b>even though</b> she <b>did not examine</b> herself <b>during</b> the twilight period as defined by <b>both</b> Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei, nevertheless, <b>we are not concerned. But</b> in such a case, <b>she did not examine</b> herself at twilight at all.
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious that</b> she <b>examined</b> herself <b>both during</b> the period <b>that Rabbi Yehuda</b> defines as twilight, <b>and during</b> the period <b>that Rabbi Yosei</b> defines as twilight. <b>But</b> if she <b>examined</b> herself <b>during</b> the period <b>that Rabbi Yehuda</b> defines as twilight, <b>and</b> she <b>did not examine</b> herself <b>during</b> the period <b>that Rabbi Yosei</b> defines as twilight, then <b>we</b> are <b>concerned.</b>
<b>Evidently,</b> the time period <b>that Rabbi Yosei</b> defines as <b>twilight is</b> considered to be of <b>uncertain</b> status regarding whether it is day or night <b>according to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. The Gemara asks: If so, one statement <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi poses <b>a difficulty for</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, as the inferences from the two parts of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s observation contradict one another.
The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>is saying: The statement of Rabbi Yehuda ben Agra appears</b> correct <b>to the Rabbis</b> in a case <b>where she did not examine</b> herself <b>at all, neither during</b> the period <b>that Rabbi Yehuda</b> defines as twilight, <b>nor during</b> the period <b>that Rabbi Yosei</b> defines as twilight. <b>As, even the Rabbis disagree with</b> Rabbi Yehuda ben Agra <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> she <b>examined</b> herself <b>during</b> the period <b>that Rabbi Yehuda</b> defines as twilight <b>but</b> she <b>did not examine</b> herself <b>during</b> the time period <b>that Rabbi Yosei</b> defines as twilight. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where</b> she <b>did not examine</b> herself <b>at all, they concede to him</b> that we are concerned that she might have emitted blood at twilight.
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a woman <b>who sees</b> a red <b>stain,</b> if she <b>saw a large</b> stain, covering an area the size of at least three split beans, she must be <b>concerned</b> that she might be a <i>zava</i>. But if she <b>saw a small</b> stain, covering an area of less than the size of three split beans, she does <b>not</b> need to <b>be concerned</b> that she is a <i>zava</i>. <b>This</b> is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda ben Agra, who said</b> it <b>in the name of Rabbi Yosei.</b>
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: I heard from</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>that</b> with regard to both <b>this one and that one,</b> i.e., whether it is a large or small stain, she <b>must be concerned</b> that she is a <i>zava</i>. <b>And</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>said</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>to me based on this reasoning: And what</b> would be the case <b>if a menstruating woman did not</b> perform the examination marking the first step in her <b>transition</b> from ritual impurity <b>to ritual purity</b> on the seventh day <b>from <i>minḥa</i></b> time <b>onward?</b> Would she <b>not</b> have <b>a presumptive status of ritual impurity?</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi added: <b>And</b> Rabbi Yosei’s <b>statement appears</b> to be correct <b>with regard to</b> the case <b>where she examined.</b>
Once again, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by the term: Where she <b>examined? If we say that she examined</b> herself <b>during</b> the period <b>that is</b> defined <b>by Rabbi Yehuda</b> as twilight, <b>but</b> she <b>did not examine</b> herself <b>during</b> the period <b>that is</b> defined <b>by Rabbi Yosei</b> as twilight, this indicates <b>by inference that Rabbi Yehuda ben Agra,</b> who disagrees in the second <i>baraita</i> with this version of Rabbi Yosei’s opinion and rules more leniently, <b>holds</b> that <b>even though</b> she <b>did not examine</b> herself <b>during</b> the twilight period as defined by <b>both Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei,</b> nevertheless, <b>she</b> does <b>not</b> need to <b>be concerned</b> that she is a <i>zava</i>. <b>But</b> this conclusion is untenable, as <b>she did not examine</b> herself at twilight at all.
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi is referring to a case <b>where</b> she examined herself <b>both during</b> the period <b>that Rabbi Yehuda</b> defines as twilight <b>and during</b> the period <b>that Rabbi Yosei</b> defines as twilight. This indicates, <b>by inference, that Rabbi Yehuda ben Agra holds</b> that if she <b>examined</b> herself <b>during</b> the period <b>that Rabbi Yehuda</b> defines as twilight, <b>but</b> she <b>did not examine</b> herself <b>during</b> the time period <b>that Rabbi Yosei</b> defines as twilight, then she does <b>not</b> need to be <b>concerned,</b> as a sighting at that time would not count as two.
<b>Evidently,</b> the period <b>that Rabbi Yosei</b> defines as <b>twilight is</b> considered to be <b>nighttime according to Rabbi Yehuda ben Agra.</b> If so, one statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda ben Agra</b> poses <b>a difficulty with regard to</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda ben Agra,</b> as earlier it was stated that according to Rabbi Yehuda ben Agra twilight is not definitely night.
<b>Granted, without</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, the apparent contradiction between these statements of Rabbi Yehuda ben Agra in the two <i>baraitot</i> is <b>not difficult,</b> as one could explain as follows: <b>There,</b> with regard to the first <i>baraita</i>, it is referring to a case <b>where she examined</b> herself <b>during</b> the period <b>that is</b> defined <b>by Rabbi Yehuda</b> as twilight, <b>but</b> she <b>did not examine</b> herself <b>during</b> the period <b>that is</b> defined <b>by Rabbi Yosei</b> as twilight. By contrast, <b>here</b> it is referring to a case <b>where she examined</b> herself <b>both during</b> the period <b>that is</b> defined <b>by Rabbi Yehuda</b> as twilight <b>and during</b> the period <b>that is</b> defined <b>by Rabbi Yosei</b> as twilight. <b>But in</b> light of the statement <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, one cannot explain in this manner, and therefore the contradiction poses <b>a difficulty.</b>
The Gemara answers: This is not a contradiction, as there are <b>two <i>tanna’im</i> and</b> they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda ben Agra. This <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda’s twilight ends,</b>

Daf 53b

<b>and</b> only <b>thereafter</b> the twilight <b>of Rabbi Yosei begins,</b> when there is uncertainty, and there is a concern that perhaps she saw blood at that time. <b>And that <i>tanna</i></b> of the second <i>baraita</i> <b>holds</b> that the <b>twilight of Rabbi Yosei is subsumed within</b> and occurs at the end of the twilight <b>of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> According to the opinion of this <i>tanna</i>, since she examined herself throughout the twilight of Rabbi Yehuda, she also necessarily examined herself throughout the twilight of Rabbi Yosei and therefore there is no need to be concerned about her status.
§ On the topic of a woman seeing a stain, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A woman <b>who sees</b> a red <b>stain</b> on her garment <b>renders herself and consecrated items</b> that she touched <b>impure retroactively,</b> from the time when that garment was last laundered. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> She does <b>render consecrated items</b> that she touched <b>impure</b> retroactively, but she <b>does not render herself impure</b> with regard to rendering impure objects that she touched since the time the garment was last laundered. The reason is <b>that her stain should not be more stringent than her</b> actual <b>seeing</b> of blood. If she experiences bleeding, she renders impure only objects that she touched during the previous twenty-four-hour period.
The Gemara asks: <b>But don’t we find</b> that Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar himself holds that <b>her stain</b> is <b>more stringent than her</b> actual <b>seeing</b> of blood <b>with regard to consecrated</b> items? Her stain renders such items impure retroactively from the time that the garment was laundered, whereas her actually seeing blood renders impure only those items that she touched during the past twenty-four-hour period.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, teach</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>like this: Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says</b> that she does <b>not even render consecrated</b> items that she touched <b>impure</b> retroactively from the time that the garment was laundered, but only those items that she touched during the past twenty-four-hour period. The reason is <b>that her stain should not be more stringent than her</b> actual <b>seeing</b> of blood <b>with regard to any matter.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a woman <b>who saw</b> a red <b>stain</b> on her garment, <b>and afterward saw blood,</b> what is the <i>halakha</i>? She <b>attributes her stain to her seeing</b> blood, i.e., the stain is treated as part of the seeing of blood, which means that she is impure only from when she found the stain, as it assumed that it appeared no earlier. This is the <i>halakha</i> provided that she saw the blood within a twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> of her discovery of the stain. But if more than twenty-four hours passed, she cannot attribute the stain to her sighting. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> She may attribute the stain to the sighting only if she experienced bleeding on the <b>day of</b> discovering the stain. If she experienced bleeding after that day, even if it was within twenty-four hours, she may not attribute the stain to the sighting, which means that she is impure retroactively from when she found the stain, in case it appeared earlier. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: The statement of</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar <b>appears</b> to be more correct <b>than mine, as he fixes her</b> situation, i.e., he is lenient, <b>and I ruin her</b> situation, as my ruling is stringent. Since the impurity of a stain applies by rabbinic law, one should follow the more lenient opinion.
The Gemara asks: But does Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar actually <b>fix her</b> situation? Does he not <b>ruin her</b> situation? If she experiences bleeding the day after she found the stain, but within twenty-four hours of finding the stain, according to Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar she renders items impure retroactively. By contrast, according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi she renders objects impure only from when she discovered the stain. <b>Ravina says: Reverse</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement, so that it states: My statement appears to be more correct than that of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, as I fix her situation and he ruins her situation.
<b>Rav Naḥman says: Actually, do not reverse</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement, as Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi meant the following: Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar’s opinion appears to be more correct, <b>as he fixes her <i>halakhot</i> with regard to <i>ziva</i>.</b> If she experiences bleeding on the day after discovering the stain, the count of her seven days of menstrual flow begins on that day of her actual sighting, not from when she saw the stain. This is due to the fact that the stain is not attributable to the seeing of the blood. Therefore, if she experiences bleeding on the seventh day after first experiencing bleeding, which is the eighth day after discovering the stain, she is not considered a lesser <i>zava</i>, and she can be purified from her status as a menstruating woman.
<b>But I,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>ruin her <i>halakhot</i> with regard to <i>ziva</i>.</b> Since the stain is attributable to the seeing of the blood within twenty-four hours, her counting starts from when she found the stain, and therefore the blood that she sees on the eighth day after discovering the stain is considered <i>ziva</i>. Consequently, she is considered a lesser <i>zava</i> and must observe a clean day for each day she experiences a discharge.
§ <b>Rabbi Zeira asked Rabbi Asi:</b> Are <b>stains</b> like the actual sight of blood, in that they <b>require</b> an examination in which she is clean of blood, marking the first step in her <b>transition</b> from impurity to <b>purity</b> before immersion on the night following the seventh day, <b>or not?</b> Rabbi Asi <b>was silent and said nothing to</b> Rabbi Zeira.
The Gemara relates that on another <b>occasion</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>found</b> Rabbi Asi <b>sitting and saying</b> that a woman who sees a stain and afterward experiences bleeding <b>attributes her stain to her seeing</b> blood, if she saw the blood within a twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> of when she discovered the stain. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
Rabbi Asi added that there is a dispute with regard to the details of this <i>halakha</i>. <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> This applies only in a case <b>where she examined</b> herself at the end of the seventh day from the discovery of the stain. This examination indicates that the stain is related to her experiencing bleeding, and therefore the standard <i>halakha</i> of a woman who becomes pure at the end of her seven menstrual days applies to her. By contrast, if she examined herself only at the end of the eighth day, the stain is not attributable to her bleeding. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The stain is attributable to her bleeding under all circumstances, <b>even if she did not examine</b> herself until the eighth day.
Upon hearing this, Rabbi Zeira <b>said to</b> Rabbi Asi: Does that mean, <b>by inference, that stains require</b> an examination marking the first step in her <b>transition</b> from impurity to <b>purity?</b> Rabbi Asi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Zeira: <b>Yes,</b> that is the <i>halakha</i>. Rabbi Zeira further said to Rabbi Asi: <b>But</b> on <b>many occasions I asked you</b> about this matter <b>and you did not say anything to me. Perhaps in the course</b> of your studies this <i>halakha</i> <b>came</b> back <b>to you?</b> Rabbi Asi <b>said to him: Yes, in the course</b> of my studies this <i>halakha</i> <b>came</b> back <b>to me.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of a woman <b>who sees</b> an emission of blood during <b>twilight</b> on the <b>eleventh day</b> of the days in which she can assume the status of a <i>zava</i>, as there is uncertainty whether the emission was during the day and it is the flow of a <i>zava</i> or whether it was at night and it is menstrual flow, she observes seven days of impurity like <b>the beginning of</b> the seven days of <b>menstruation and the end of menstruation.</b> If she experienced an emission on the two previous days as well, she observes seven clean days before immersion like <b>the beginning of the flow of <i>ziva</i> and the end of the flow of <i>ziva</i>.</b>
Similarly, in the case of a woman who experiences an emission of blood during twilight on <b>the fortieth day</b> after the birth <b>of a male or the eightieth day</b> after the birth <b>of a female,</b> there is uncertainty whether it is considered daytime and therefore part of the final day of the blood of purity, or night that is part of the following day when the blood is impure. With regard to experiencing bleeding during <b>twilight in all</b> those cases, <b>these</b> women <b>are mistaken</b> in their calculation of the days of menstrual flow and the flow of a <i>zava</i>. Consequently, if they experience bleeding for three consecutive days at the beginning or at the end of the eleven days of <i>ziva</i>, they bring the offering of a <i>zava</i> but it is not eaten, as it was brought based on uncertainty.
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said: Instead of</b> making provisions to <b>remedy</b> the uncertainties <b>of the misguided, come and remedy</b> the uncertainties of <b>the competent</b> women who know what day they saw the blood but require guidance, due to the multitude of emissions that they experienced.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if a woman experiences bleeding during twilight on the eleventh day of the days on which she can assume the status of a <i>zava</i>, the flow is considered to be <b>the beginning of</b> the seven days of <b>menstruation and the end of menstruation.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: But the concern <b>is</b> only that this flow might be either <b>the beginning of</b> the seven days of <b>menstruation,</b> if twilight is treated as night, <b>or the end of <i>ziva</i>,</b> if twilight is treated as day.
<b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> A woman <b>who sees</b> an emission of blood during <b>twilight</b> on the <b>eleventh day</b> of the days on which she can assume the status of a <i>zava</i> must be concerned both for the possibility that it is <b>the beginning of</b> the seven days of <b>menstruation and</b> for the possibility that it is <b>the end of the flow of <i>ziva</i>.</b> If she had also seen an emission on the two previous days, she observes seven clean days before immersion, due to uncertainty.
With regard to the continuation of the mishna, which states: The beginning of the flow of <i>ziva</i> and the end of the flow of <i>ziva</i>, this should be understood as follows: <b>And</b> in the case of a woman who experiences an emission of blood during twilight <b>on the seventh</b> day of the seven days of the flow <b>of her menstruation,</b> she must be concerned both for the possibility that it is <b>the end of</b> the seven days of <b>menstruation and</b> for the possibility that it is <b>the beginning of the flow of <i>ziva</i>.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said</b> to the Rabbis: <b>Instead of</b> making provisions to <b>remedy</b> the uncertainties <b>of the misguided,</b> come and remedy the uncertainties of the competent women. The Gemara asks: <b>Are these</b> women who experience bleeding during twilight

Daf 54a

actually <b>misguided?</b> Since they are in doubt as to their status, would it not be more accurate to say that <b>they are mistaken?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> this is how one should <b>teach</b> the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua in the mishna: Instead of making provisions to remedy the uncertainties of the <b>mistaken,</b> come and remedy the uncertainties of the competent women.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to these competent women: What is the <i>halakha</i> in the case of a woman who consistently has the following pattern for each pair of days: <b>One day</b> she is <b>impure,</b> i.e., she experiences bleeding, <b>and one day</b> she is <b>pure,</b> she does not experience bleeding? In what manner is it permitted for her to engage in intercourse with her husband? She <b>may engage in intercourse</b> with her husband on the <b>eighth day</b> from the first time that she experienced bleeding <b>and its accompanying night.</b> At that time she is pure from her menstruation, as she immersed and purified herself on the night of the seventh day. It is permitted for her to engage in intercourse during the eighth day and the following night, as she will not experience bleeding until the ninth day.
In addition, she may engage in intercourse <b>four nights out of</b> the cycle of <b>eighteen days,</b> which consist of the seven menstrual days and the eleven days of the flow of the <i>zava</i>. This woman will never become a greater <i>zava</i>, as she does not emit blood on consecutive days. Since she must observe a day of purity during the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> each time she experiences bleeding, she may engage in intercourse with her husband on the night following the tenth, twelfth, fourteen, and sixteenth days. The night after the eighteenth day is considered part of the next cycle of menstruation and <i>ziva</i>. <b>But if</b> she <b>sees</b> blood <b>in the evening,</b> she <b>may engage in intercourse</b> with her husband <b>only</b> on the <b>eighth</b> night and its day. During the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> she either experiences bleeding at night or is observing a day of purity for the blood she had emitted earlier.
If in every set of four days, <b>two days</b> she is <b>impure,</b> i.e., experiences bleeding, <b>and two days</b> she is <b>pure,</b> she <b>may engage in intercourse</b> with her husband on the <b>eighth</b> day, in the day or at night, <b>and</b> also on the <b>twelfth</b> day, after observing the eleventh as a day of purity for the sightings of the ninth and tenth days, <b>and</b> by a similar calculation on the <b>sixteenth</b> day <b>and</b> on the <b>twentieth</b> day, as she has not yet seen the blood of menstruation in this new cycle.
The Gemara objects: <b>And let her also engage in intercourse</b> with her husband on the <b>nineteenth</b> day, as the eleven days of the flow of the <i>zava</i> have already passed at the end of the eighteenth day, and she is no longer required to observe a clean day for each day she experiences a discharge. <b>Rav Sheshet says: That is to say that when we learned</b> in a mishna (72a) that a husband who could not wait for the conclusion of the day after the last day of <i>ziva</i> before engaging in intercourse is <b>a glutton,</b> it means that it is actually <b>prohibited</b> for them to engage in intercourse.
<b>Rav Ashi says:</b> In fact, it is not prohibited for a woman to engage in intercourse with her husband on the day after the end of the days of the flow of the <i>zava</i> even by rabbinic decree, as it is already the beginning of her menstrual days, and she is no longer required to observe a clean day for each day she experiences a discharge. But <b>although</b> there is <b>no requirement</b> to <b>observe</b> a clean day <b>for</b> the <b>eleventh day</b> of <i>ziva</i>, which is the eighteenth day of the full cycle, <b>in any event</b> there is <b>a requirement</b> to <b>observe</b> a clean day for the <b>tenth day,</b> i.e., the seventeenth of the entire cycle. Since she did not observe a clean day on the eighteenth day, as she saw blood on that day as well, she must observe the nineteenth day in purity.
If out of every set of six days, <b>three days</b> she is <b>impure, and three days</b> she is <b>pure,</b> she <b>may engage in intercourse</b> with her husband during <b>two</b> of the <b>days, and thereafter</b> she may <b>never again engage in intercourse</b> with him. The eighth and ninth days, which are the first days of the flow of <i>ziva</i>, are the second and third of the three days on which she experiences bleeding. Therefore, she can immerse and purify herself on the night of the eleventh, and engage in intercourse with her husband on the eleventh and twelfth days. These are the only two days on which she is permitted to engage in intercourse with her husband, as afterward she will experience bleeding for three days during the days of the flow of the <i>zava</i>, and is thereby rendered a greater <i>zava</i>. Accordingly, she requires seven clean days to become pure again, which she will never attain, as she never has more than three clean days.
If out of every set of eight days, <b>four days</b> she is <b>impure, and four days</b> she is <b>pure,</b> she <b>may engage in intercourse</b> with her husband during <b>one</b> of the <b>days,</b> the eighth, after her purification for menstruation, as it is the last of her first set of four days without blood, <b>and thereafter</b> she may <b>never again engage in intercourse</b> with him, as she will be rendered a greater <i>zava</i> by experiencing bleeding on the next three days.
If out of every set of ten days, <b>five days</b> she is <b>impure, and five days</b> she is <b>pure,</b> she <b>may engage in intercourse</b> with her husband during <b>three</b> of the <b>days,</b> i.e., the eighth, ninth, and tenth, as she has completed her menstruation period and has not yet emitted the blood of <i>ziva</i>, <b>and thereafter</b> she may <b>never again engage in intercourse</b> with him. Similarly, if out of every set of twelve days, <b>six days</b> she is <b>impure, and six days</b> she is <b>pure,</b> she <b>may engage in intercourse</b> with her husband during <b>five</b> of the <b>days,</b> i.e., the eighth to the twelfth, <b>and thereafter</b> she may <b>never again engage in intercourse</b> with him.
If out of every set of fourteen days, <b>seven days</b> she is <b>impure, and seven days</b> she is <b>pure,</b> she <b>may engage in intercourse</b> with her husband during <b>a quarter</b> of the <b>days of her</b> life, i.e., seven <b>out of</b> every <b>twenty-eight days.</b> In the first seven days she is a menstruating woman, but during the next seven days she is pure. In the third set of seven days, when she again experiences bleeding, she becomes a <i>zava</i>, which means that in her last seven days, which are without blood, she counts the clean days for her <i>ziva</i>, after which this cycle of twenty-eight days begins afresh.
If out of every set of sixteen days, <b>eight days</b> she is <b>impure, and eight days</b> she is <b>pure,</b> she <b>may engage in intercourse</b> with her husband <b>fifteen days out of</b> every <b>forty-eight</b> days. The first eight days during which she experiences bleeding are the seven days of menstruation and one day of <i>ziva</i>, which renders her a lesser <i>zava</i>. Therefore, she must observe one clean day, after which she is pure for seven days. The first two days of the third set of eight are her last days of <i>ziva</i>, and the bleeding she experiences renders her again a lesser <i>zava</i>, while the next six are during her days of menstruation. Then she starts her fourth set of eight days, which are without blood. The first of these completes her days of menstruation, after which she may engage in intercourse for the subsequent seven days. During the fifth set of eight days she experiences bleeding, rendering her a greater <i>zava</i>. She counts her clean days in the sixth set, leaving her one day of purity, after which the cycle of forty-eight days starts again.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> the days during which she is permitted <b>are</b> actually only <b>fourteen,</b> not fifteen. This objection is based on the assumption that a woman cannot count her clean days for <i>ziva</i> during days that are fit for menstruation. Consequently, the last four days of the fifth cycle are actually part of her days of menstruation, as her eleven days of <i>ziva</i> ended after the fourth day of that cycle. If so, the sixth set of eight days consists of three menstrual days followed by five days of <i>ziva</i>. Although she is not a menstruating woman in those three days, as she did not previously count seven clean days, they still do not count for her seven clean days of <i>ziva</i>, since they are fit to be menstrual days. She can start counting her seven clean days only on day forty-four, but on day forty-nine, before the seven clean days are finished, she will again experience bleeding. Therefore, it should not be permitted for her to engage in intercourse with her husband on the forty-eighth night.
<b>Rav Adda bar Yitzḥak says</b> that this premise should be rejected: <b>That is to say</b> that <b>her menstrual days on which she does not</b> actually <b>see</b> blood <b>do count toward her counting of her</b> seven clean days of <b><i>ziva</i>.</b> In other words, she begins counting the seven clean days during these menstrual days. <b>As a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages with regard to this issue:

Daf 54b

<b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of a woman who gave birth when she was a <i>zava</i>? There are seven <b>days of</b> impurity following the <b>birth</b> of a son and fourteen days of impurity following the birth of a daughter, during which the mother is impure even if she did not experience bleeding. With regard to those days during this period <b>on which she does not see</b> blood, are they <b>reckoned in the counting of her</b> seven clean days required to become purified from the status of <b><i>ziva</i>?</b>
<b>Rav Kahana says: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: A woman <b>saw</b> blood on <b>two</b> consecutive days during the period of <i>ziva</i>, <b>and on the third</b> day <b>she miscarried, but she does not know what she miscarried,</b> i.e., whether it was a stillborn human fetus for which a woman contracts the impurity of childbirth, or whether she discharged an amorphous piece of tissue. In addition, she does not know whether she emitted blood during the miscarriage.
In such a case, <b>it is uncertain</b> whether <b>she</b> has the status of one who experienced <b><i>ziva</i> or</b> whether she has the status of a woman who gave <b>birth.</b> If she gave birth to a fetus and did not emit blood, she is a woman after childbirth but not a <i>zava</i>. If the discharge was an amorphous piece of tissue and she saw blood, she is a <i>zava</i>. If it was a human fetus and she saw blood, she is one who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>. Finally, if she did not emit blood and it was a discharge of an amorphous piece of tissue, she is not obligated to bring an offering at all.
Consequently, <b>she brings an offering but it is not eaten</b> by the priests, as it is uncertain whether it is an offering of <i>ziva</i> or an offering for her childbirth, or whether it is non-sacred. <b>And</b> the <b>days of</b> impurity following this uncertain <b>birth, on which she does not see</b> blood, <b>are reckoned in the counting of her</b> seven clean days required to become purified from the status of <b><i>ziva</i>.</b> This resolves the dilemma raised by the Sages.
<b>Rav Pappa says</b> that this does not resolve the dilemma, as it <b>is different there, since it can be said</b> that <b>she is a woman who gave birth to a male, and</b> it is only for that reason that <b>all of these additional seven</b> days <b>that we give her</b> due to the concern that she might have given birth to a female, which would render her impure for fourteen days, <b>are reckoned in the counting of her</b> seven clean days of <b><i>ziva</i>.</b> But if it was certain that she gave birth to a female, those days after the birth would not count toward her period of <i>ziva</i>.
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said to Rav Pappa:</b> Is <b>there uncertainty that</b> perhaps she is <b>a woman who gave birth to a male,</b> but <b>there</b> is <b>no uncertainty that</b> she might be <b>a woman who gave birth to a female?</b> In fact, both possibilities must be taken into account. And yet, despite the fact that she might have given birth to a female, these seven days are included in the counting of her seven clean days. <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> it that such days <b>are reckoned</b> in the counting? The Gemara comments: Indeed, <b>conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that these days do count.
The Gemara concludes its citation of the <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a woman whose set pattern is that <b>nine days</b> she is <b>impure,</b> i.e., experiences bleeding, <b>and nine days</b> she is <b>pure,</b> she <b>may engage in intercourse</b> with her husband during <b>eight days out of eighteen.</b> The last two days of the nine with blood are part of her <i>ziva</i> period, after which she must observe one clean day, leaving her with eight days when she may engage in intercourse before the cycle begins again.
In the case of a woman whose set pattern is that <b>ten days</b> she is <b>impure and ten days</b> she is <b>pure,</b> the number of <b>days of her</b> being permitted to <b>engage in intercourse</b> with her husband <b>is equivalent to</b> the number of <b>days of her</b> experiencing the flow of <b><i>ziva</i>.</b> In the first seven days she is a menstruating woman, followed by three days of blood that render her a <i>zava</i>. She must count seven of the ten days without blood to be purified from her <i>ziva</i>, which leaves her three days in which she may engage in intercourse, exactly the same as the three days of <i>ziva</i> on which she saw blood. <b>And so too,</b> the same applies in the case <b>of one hundred</b> days, as she experiences bleeding of <i>ziva</i> for ninety-three days, and is subsequently permitted to her husband for ninety-three days, <b>and so too</b> in the case <b>of one thousand</b> days.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The blood of a menstruating woman and the flesh of a corpse transmit impurity</b> by contact and by carrying when they are <b>moist, and</b> likewise <b>transmit impurity</b> when they are <b>dry. But</b> with regard to <b>the</b> gonorrhea-like <b>discharge of a <i>zav</i> [<i>ziva</i>], and the mucus and the saliva</b> of a <i>zav</i>, <b>and</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal, and an animal carcass, and semen,</b> all <b>transmit impurity</b> when they are <b>moist but do not transmit impurity</b> when they are <b>dry. And if one could soak</b> those dry substances in water <b>and</b> thereby <b>restore</b> them <b>to their</b> previous <b>state, they transmit impurity</b> when <b>moist and transmit impurity</b> when <b>dry.</b>
The mishna asks: <b>And how long is the</b> process of <b>soaking these</b> substances that determines whether they can be restored to their previous state? This is referring to soaking them <b>in lukewarm</b> water <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> With regard to <b>the flesh of a corpse</b> that is <b>dry and cannot be soaked to restore</b> it <b>to</b> its <b>previous state,</b> it is <b>ritually pure,</b> in the sense that an olive-bulk of the flesh does not transmit impurity imparted by a corpse. But a ladleful of the flesh transmits the impurity of the decayed flesh of a corpse.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the blood of a menstruating woman transmits impurity by contact and by carrying both when moist and when dry. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Ḥizkiyya says:</b> They are derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to a menstruating woman: “This is the law of him that has an issue…<b>And of her who experiences the flow of her menstrual impurity”</b> (Leviticus 15:32–33). The verse compares the status of the menstrual flow to that of the menstruating woman. This teaches that the status of <b>the menstrual flow is like</b> the status of the woman <b>herself: Just as she transmits impurity</b> by contact and by carrying, <b>so too, the menstrual flow transmits impurity</b> by contact and by carrying.
The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for the impurity of the menstrual blood when it is <b>moist,</b> since it is called the menstrual flow; <b>from where do we</b> derive that <b>dry</b> menstrual blood also transmits impurity? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to menstrual impurity: “And if a woman should have an issue, and her issue in her flesh <b>shall be</b> blood, she shall be in her impurity seven days, and whoever touches her shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:19). The term “shall be” indicates that the blood <b>shall</b> remain <b>in its</b> impure <b>status</b> even once it is dry.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> one may <b>say</b> that <b>this statement</b> applies only <b>to</b> blood that was initially <b>moist and</b> subsequently <b>became dry,</b> as it retains its initial status. With regard to blood that was <b>dry at the outset, from where do we</b> derive that it too transmits impurity? <b>And furthermore,</b> this inference does not provide a source for <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (21a): In the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> an item whose shape is <b>similar to a type of shell, similar to a type of soil, similar to a type of hair,</b> or <b>similar to a type of mosquito,</b> if such items are <b>red, she should cast</b> them <b>into water</b> to ascertain their nature. <b>If they dissolved,</b> it is blood, and the woman is <b>impure. From where do we</b> derive that even this type of blood is impure? The Gemara explains: The term <b>“shall be” is an amplification,</b> indicating that menstrual blood in all these forms is impure.
The Gemara objects: <b>If</b> so, one can likewise infer the following: <b>Just as she,</b> a menstruating woman, <b>renders</b> an item designated for <b>lying or sitting</b> impure <b>to</b> the extent that it <b>transmits impurity to a person and</b> to the extent that that person <b>transmits impurity to</b> his <b>garments,</b> despite the fact that the garments did not come into contact with the couch, <b>so too, her blood also renders</b> items designated for <b>lying or sitting</b> impure <b>to</b> the extent that they <b>transmit impurity to a person and</b> to the extent that he <b>transmits impurity to</b> his <b>garments,</b> in the manner of a primary source of ritual impurity. The Gemara replies: <b>Is that to say</b> that the concepts of <b>lying and sitting apply</b> to <b>her</b> menstrual <b>blood?</b> These categories of impurity are limited to people.
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to your reasoning</b> that this category of impurity is limited to people, <b>do</b> the concepts of <b>lying and sitting apply</b> to <b>a stone afflicted</b> with leprosy, so <b>that a verse was necessary to exclude</b> it? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>a stone afflicted</b> with leprosy <b>should render</b> an item designated for <b>lying or sitting</b> impure <b>to</b> the extent that it <b>transmits impurity to a person and</b> to the extent that he <b>transmits impurity to</b> his <b>garments.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>And</b> this ruling might be derived by <b>logical inference:</b> If one enters a house where there is a stone afflicted with leprosy he becomes impure, but one who enters a house together with a man who experienced a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>] does not become impure. One may therefore infer as follows: <b>If a <i>zav</i>, who does not transmit impurity by entering</b> a house, nevertheless <b>renders</b> an item designated for <b>lying or sitting</b> impure <b>to</b> the extent that it <b>transmits impurity to a person</b> and to the extent that that person <b>transmits impurity to</b> his <b>garments,</b> then with regard to <b>a stone afflicted</b> with leprosy, <b>which does transmit impurity by entering</b> a house, <b>is it not logical that</b> it <b>renders</b> an item designated for <b>lying or sitting impure to</b> the extent that it <b>transmits impurity to a person</b> and to the extent that he <b>transmits impurity to</b> the <b>garments</b> he is wearing?
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Every bed upon which the <i>zav</i> lies shall be impure, and every item upon which he sits shall be impure” (Leviticus 15:4). The term <b>“the <i>zav</i>”</b> indicates that only <b>the <i>zav</i>, and not a stone afflicted</b> with leprosy, renders items designated for lying or sitting impure. The Gemara infers from the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The reason</b> a stone afflicted with leprosy does not transmit impurity to items designated for lying or sitting is <b>that the verse excluded it, but</b> were it <b>not so,</b> the stone <b>would transmit impurity</b> to items designated for lying or sitting, despite the fact that the concepts of lying and sitting do not apply to a stone.
The Gemara replies that <b>from this</b> same derivation one can infer that menstrual blood does not render items designated for lying or sitting impure: <b>Didn’t you say</b> that the term “the <i>zav</i>” teaches that only <b>the <i>zav</i>, and not a stone afflicted</b> with leprosy, renders items designated for lying or sitting impure? <b>So too,</b> a verse excludes menstrual blood from this category of impurity, as <b>the verse states:</b> “And he if is on the bed, or on any item <b>upon which she sits,</b> when he touches it, he shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:23). The term “she” indicates that <b>she,</b> the menstruating woman, <b>but not her blood,</b> transmits impurity to items designated for lying or sitting.

Daf 55a

The Gemara raises an objection: There is a unique <i>halakha</i> with regard to the impurity of a <i>zav</i> and a menstruating woman: In a case where one of them sits on an item, including one that cannot become ritually impure, e.g., a stone, and beneath that item is a vessel, that vessel becomes impure, even if their weight has no effect on the vessel, as in the case of a very heavy stone. <b>If</b> the verse compares the status of the menstrual blood to the status of the menstruating woman, as derived above, one can infer as follows: <b>Just as</b> a menstruating woman <b>transmits impurity to</b> items that lie beneath <b>a very heavy stone, so too, her menstrual flow also transmits impurity to</b> items that lie beneath <b>a very heavy stone.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> in response: Items designated for lying or sitting also transmit impurity to items that lie beneath a very heavy stone. <b>The verse states</b> with regard to an item of this kind, which was rendered impure by a <i>zav</i>: “And whoever touches anything that was under him shall be impure until the evening, <b>and he that carries them</b> shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and he shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:10). The term <b>“them” is an exclusion,</b> indicating that items designated for lying or sitting transmit impurity to items that lie beneath a very heavy stone, but menstrual blood does not.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And the flesh of a corpse</b> transmits impurity both when moist and when dry. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Reish Lakish said</b> that this is as <b>the verse states:</b> “Or whoever touches any creeping thing by which he may be made impure, or a man from whom he may be made impure, <b>from any impurity that he has”</b> (Leviticus 22:5). The term “from any” is an amplification, indicating that one may become impure <b>from any impurities that come from</b> a dead person, whether they are moist or dry.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived from the verse: “And whoever touches in the open field one who is slain with a sword, or one who died, <b>or the bone of a man, or a grave,</b> shall be impure seven days” (Numbers 19:16). The verse indicates that the impurity of a dead <b>man</b> is <b>similar to</b> the impurity of <b>a bone: Just as a bone</b> is <b>dry, so too here,</b> with regard to the impurity of a corpse, it transmits impurity even when it is <b>dry.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> the inferences of Reish Lakish and Rabbi Yoḥanan? The Gemara answers that the practical difference <b>between them</b> is the case of a corpse which is so dry <b>that it crumbles.</b> Reish Lakish maintains it is impure, as the term “from any” indicates that a corpse transmits impurity in any form, whereas Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains it is ritually pure, as it is unlike a bone, which does not crumble.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Reish Lakish from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The flesh of a corpse that crumbled</b> is <b>ritually pure.</b> The Gemara answers that this is not difficult, as the <i>baraita</i> <b>there</b> is referring to where the flesh is so dry <b>that it has become</b> like <b>flour and is</b> therefore classified as <b>dust.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinions of both Reish Lakish and Rabbi Yoḥanan from a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 3:3): <b>Everything that is in a corpse transmits impurity, except for the teeth, and the hair, and the nails.</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> only when these items are separated from the body, <b>but when they are attached</b> to the corpse they are <b>all impure.</b> According to Rabbi Yoḥanan teeth should transmit impurity because they are similar to bones, while according to Reish Lakish they should be included in the term “from any.”
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said:</b> Only items that are <b>similar to a bone</b> transmit impurity: <b>Just as a bone</b> is an item <b>that was created with him</b> at the time of birth, <b>so too, all</b> items that transmit impurity are those <b>that were created with him,</b> whereas teeth are not present at the time of birth. The Gemara asks: <b>But are there not</b> the cases of <b>hair and nails, which were created with him, and</b> yet the mishna states that <b>they are ritually pure?</b>
<b>Rather, Rav Adda bar Ahava said</b> a different explanation: Only those items that are <b>similar to a bone</b> transmit impurity: <b>Just as a bone</b> is an item <b>that was created with him and its root does not renew</b> itself, i.e., if a bone is removed a new bone does not grow in its place, <b>so too, any item that was created with him and whose root does not renew</b> itself transmits impurity. <b>The teeth were excluded</b> from this category, <b>as they were not created with him.</b> The <b>hair and nails were excluded, as even though they were created with him</b> their <b>roots renew</b> themselves, since they grow again after they are cut off.
The Gemara objects: <b>But isn’t there</b> the case of <b>skin, whose root renews</b> itself, <b>and</b> this is as <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥullin</i> 54a): In the case of an animal <b>whose hide was removed [<i>hageluda</i>], Rabbi Meir deems</b> it <b>kosher,</b> as the skin renews itself, <b>and the Rabbis deem</b> it an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>] and <b>unfit</b> for consumption. The Gemara explains: <b>And even the Rabbis deem</b> it <b>unfit only</b> due to the fact <b>that in the meantime,</b> between the removal of the old hide and the growth of the new one, <b>the air affects it and</b> as a result <b>it</b> will <b>die, but</b> they concede that <b>actually</b> the skin’s <b>root renews</b> itself. <b>And</b> nevertheless <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥullin</i> 122a): <b>These</b> are the entities <b>whose skin</b> has the same halakhic status <b>as their flesh: The skin of a</b> dead <b>person,</b> and the skin of a domesticated pig…and the skin of the hump of a young camel, etc.
The Gemara explains that <b>it was stated with regard to that</b> mishna that <b>Ulla said: By Torah law, the skin of</b> a dead <b>person is ritually pure. And what is the reason</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that it is <b>impure?</b> It is a rabbinic <b>decree lest a person should fashion rugs for a donkey</b> out of <b>the skins of his</b> deceased <b>father and mother.</b>
<b>And some say</b> a different version of the above discussion: <b>Isn’t there</b> the case of <b>skin, whose root does not renew</b> itself, <b>and</b> this is as <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥullin</i> 54a): In the case of an animal whose hide was removed, Rabbi Meir deems it kosher, <b>and the Rabbis deem</b> it a <i>tereifa</i> and <b>unfit</b> for consumption, as its skin does not regrow? The Gemara explains: <b>And even Rabbi Meir deems</b> it <b>fit only because the flesh cools and</b> the animal <b>heals, but</b> he concedes that <b>actually</b> the skin’s <b>root does not renew</b> itself. Accordingly, the skin of a corpse should be impure. <b>But Ulla said: By Torah law, the skin of</b> a dead <b>person is ritually pure.</b>
The Gemara answers that <b>when</b> the opinion <b>of Ulla was stated, it was stated with regard to the latter clause</b> of that mishna: <b>And</b> for <b>all of</b> these skins, in a case <b>where one tanned them or where one</b> spread them on the ground and <b>trod on them</b> for the same amount of time it takes <b>for tanning,</b> they are no longer classified as flesh and <b>are ritually pure, except for the skin of</b> a dead <b>person,</b> which maintains the status of flesh. <b>And</b> with regard to this <b>Ulla said</b> that <b>by Torah law the skin of</b> a dead <b>person, when one tanned it, is ritually pure. And what is the reason</b> the Sages <b>said</b> it is <b>impure?</b> It is a rabbinic <b>decree lest a person should fashion rugs</b> out of <b>the skin of his</b> deceased <b>father and mother.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> the case of <b>flesh, whose root renews</b> itself, as when one’s flesh is cut it regrows and heals, <b>and</b> yet it is <b>impure? Mar bar Rav Ashi says: Flesh</b> does not renew itself, as although when someone is cut his flesh regrows and heals, <b>a scar is formed</b> in <b>its place.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>But <i>ziva</i></b> transmits impurity when moist, although not when dry. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b><i>ziva</i></b> transmits impurity? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that discusses the verse: “When any man has an issue out of his flesh, <b>his issue,</b> it is <b>impure”</b> (Leviticus 15:2). This <b>taught with regard to <i>ziva</i> that it is impure.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> asks: Why is this derivation necessary? <b>Could this not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference?</b> Since <i>ziva</i> <b>causes impurity to others,</b> i.e., to the one who emitted the discharge, is it <b>not all the more so</b> that <i>ziva</i> <b>itself</b> is impure? The <i>baraita</i> replies that the case of the <b>scapegoat</b> brought on Yom Kippur <b>may prove</b> that this inference is not valid, <b>as it causes impurity to others,</b> i.e., the dispatcher of the scapegoat is rendered impure, <b>and</b> yet the goat <b>itself is pure. So too, you should not be surprised about this,</b> the discharge of <i>ziva</i>, <b>that even though it causes impurity to others,</b> <i>ziva</i> <b>itself is pure.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “His issue,</b> it is <b>impure.”</b> This <b>taught with regard to <i>ziva</i> that it is impure.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> one <b>may say</b> that <b>this statement,</b> that the discharge of <i>ziva</i> transmits impurity, applies only to transmitting impurity <b>by contact. But</b> with regard to transmitting impurity <b>by carrying</b> it does <b>not</b> transmit impurity, <b>just as it is with regard to</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal,</b> which transmits impurity by contact but not by carrying. <b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye said: A verse was not necessary</b> to teach that <i>ziva</i> transmits ritual impurity <b>by contact, as</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <i>ziva</i> is <b>no less</b> stringent <b>than</b> with regard to <b>semen,</b> which transmits impurity by contact.

Daf 55b

<b>When the verse was necessary,</b> it was <b>to</b> teach that <i>ziva</i> transmits impurity by <b>carrying.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> yet one may <b>say</b> that <i>ziva</i> <b>transmits impurity</b> to <b>a person and</b> to his <b>garments</b> only <b>by carrying, but</b> as for impurity <b>by contact,</b> although <i>ziva</i> <b>transmits impurity</b> to the <b>person</b> who touches it, <b>it does not transmit impurity</b> to his <b>garments, just as is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to contact</b> with an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass.</b> If one touches a carcass he is rendered impure but his garments remain pure, despite the fact that if one carries a carcass his garments are also rendered impure.
The Gemara answers: This could <b>not enter your mind, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say,</b> with regard to the verse: “This is the law of him that has an issue…And of her who experiences the flow of her menstrual impurity, and <b>of one who emits his issue [<i>zovo</i>], in the case of a male or a female”</b> (Leviticus 15:32–33). The verse <b>juxtaposes</b> the impurity of <b>the issue of the <i>zav</i> to</b> the impurity of the <i>zav</i> <b>himself: Just as</b> with regard to <b>him you did not distinguish between</b> impurity transmitted by <b>contact with him and</b> impurity transmitted by <b>carrying him, as</b> in both cases the <i>zav</i> <b>transmits impurity to a person and transmits impurity to</b> his <b>garments, so too,</b> with regard to <b>the issue of the <i>zav</i></b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>the same.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And now that we have derived</b> the impurity of the discharge of a <i>zav</i> <b>from</b> the verse: “And <b>of one who emits his issue”</b> (Leviticus 15:33), <b>why do I</b> need the verse: “When any man has an issue out of his flesh, <b>his issue,</b> it is <b>impure”</b> (Leviticus 15:2)?
<b>Rav Yehuda of Diskarta said:</b> This verse <b>was necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that the case of the <b>scapegoat may prove</b> that the discharge of a <i>zav</i> is not impure, <b>as</b> the scapegoat <b>causes impurity to others and</b> yet the goat <b>itself is pure.</b> Likewise, one might conclude that although the discharge of a <i>zav</i> causes impurity to others, <i>ziva</i> itself is pure. <b>And if</b> one were to dismiss this possibility, <b>due to</b> the verse: “And <b>of one who emits his issue [<i>zovo</i>],</b> in the case of a male or a female” (Leviticus 15:33), one could reply <b>that</b> it does not indicate the impurity of <i>ziva</i>. Rather, <b>it comes to</b> teach the <b>number</b> of emissions by which one becomes impure with the impurity of a <i>zav</i>.
Rav Yehuda of Diskarta clarifies this interpretation of the verse. The term: <b>An issue [<i>zov</i>],</b> would indicate <b>one</b> emission of <i>ziva</i>. Since the verse uses the term <b>“his issue [<i>zovo</i>],”</b> the superfluous addition indicates <b>two</b> emissions of <i>ziva</i>. With regard to these two emissions, the verse states: “In the case of a male,” indicating that the status of a male <i>zav</i> differs from the status of a female <i>zava</i> in that he is not rendered impure if the emission occurred due to an accident, which would render a female impure. <b>But in</b> the case of <b>the third</b> emission of <i>ziva</i> <b>the Merciful One juxtaposed</b> the status of a male <i>zav</i> <b>to</b> that of <b>a female,</b> as the verse states: “Or a female,” indicating that even if the third emission was due to an accident he is nevertheless obligated to bring an offering.
Since one would not have derived the impurity of <i>ziva</i> from this verse, <b>the Merciful One wrote: “His issue,</b> it is <b>impure”</b> (Leviticus 15:2). <b>And now that the Merciful One states: “His issue, it is impure,”</b> one <b>may derive from</b> the verse “and of one who emits his issue” not only the number of emissions, but <b>also this</b> interpretation, that there is no difference between the impurity imparted by <i>ziva</i> by contact and by carrying.
§ The mishna teaches: And the mucus <b>and the saliva</b> of a <i>zav</i> transmit impurity when moist but not when dry. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive the ritual impurity of the <b>saliva</b> of a <i>zav</i>? The Gemara answers that this is derived <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And if</b> one who has an issue <b>spits</b> on the pure person, then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and he is impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:8). One <b>might</b> have thought that the saliva transmits impurity even if the <i>zav</i> merely spat in the direction of a pure person, <b>despite</b> the fact <b>that it did not</b> come into <b>contact</b> with him. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And if one who has an issue spits <b>on the pure person,”</b> which teaches that <b>unless</b> the saliva comes into <b>contact with the pure person</b> he is not rendered impure.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>his saliva</b> is impure. <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>his phlegm, his mucus, and his nasal fluids</b> are also impure? <b>The verse states: “And if</b> one who has an issue <b>spits.”</b> The superfluous “and” is an amplification, indicating that these substances also transmit impurity.
<b>The Master said</b> above: One <b>might</b> have thought that the saliva transmits impurity even if the <i>zav</i> merely spat in the direction of a pure person, <b>despite</b> the fact <b>that it did not</b> come into <b>contact</b> with him. The Gemara asks: <b>From where would this be derived?</b> Why would one think that a person becomes impure from saliva that did not come into contact with him, making it necessary for a verse to exclude this possibility?
The Gemara explains: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>we should derive</b> a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the term <b>saliva</b> in the verse “and if one who has an issue spits,” and the term <b>saliva</b> stated in connection with <b>a <i>yevama</i>,</b> a widow whose husband died childless and who participates in <i>ḥalitza</i>, as the verse states: “His <i>yevama</i> shall approach him, before the Elders, and remove his shoe from on his foot and spit before him” (Deuteronomy 25:9). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to <i>ḥalitza</i>, the ritual is valid <b>even though</b> the saliva <b>did not touch</b> her brother-in-law, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the saliva of a <i>zav</i>, it transmits impurity despite the fact <b>that it did not</b> come into <b>contact</b> with the pure person. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that the saliva of a <i>zav</i> transmits impurity only if it comes into contact with the pure person.
The Gemara objects: <b>And</b> yet one <b>may say</b> that <b>this statement,</b> that the saliva of a <i>zav</i> transmits impurity, applies only to transmitting impurity <b>by contact. But</b> with regard to transmitting impurity <b>by carrying</b> it does <b>not</b> transmit impurity, <b>just as is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal,</b> which transmits impurity by contact but not by carrying. <b>Reish Lakish said</b> that <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The verse states:</b> “And if one who has an issue spits <b>on the pure person.”</b> The term “on the pure person” is interpreted to mean that in any case where <b>something</b> of the saliva <b>is in the hand of</b> the <b>pure person I deemed</b> him <b>impure for you,</b> even if he did not come into direct contact with the saliva but merely carried it.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> one may <b>say</b> that although the saliva of a <i>zav</i> transmits impurity both by carrying and by contact, nevertheless there is the following difference between them: <b>By carrying</b> the saliva of a <i>zav</i>, <b>it transmits impurity</b> to <b>a person and</b> to his <b>garments,</b> but <b>by contact,</b> although it <b>transmits impurity</b> to the <b>person</b> who touches it, <b>it does not transmit impurity</b> to his <b>garments, just as is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to contact</b> with an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass.</b>
<b>Reish Lakish said, and so</b> too <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught,</b> that <b>the verse states:</b> “And if one who has an issue spits <b>on the pure person.”</b> The term “on the pure person” teaches that a case of <b>purity,</b> i.e., that <b>which I deemed pure for you in a different case, I have deemed impure for you here. And which</b> case <b>is this? This is</b> referring to <b>contact</b> with <b>an animal carcass,</b> which renders only the one touching it impure, but not his garments, whereas the saliva of a <i>zav</i> renders them both impure.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that the case deemed pure elsewhere but deemed impure here is that <b>of carrying</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal.</b> Perhaps the verse is teaching that whereas a creeping animal does not transmit impurity by carrying, the saliva of a <i>zav</i> does transmit impurity by carrying. By contrast, contact with the saliva of a <i>zav</i> renders only the one touching it impure, but not his garments, as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to an animal carcass. The Gemara responds: <b>If that is so, let the verse write:</b> If one who has an issue spits <b>on the person. What</b> is the reason the verse states specifically: <b>“On the pure person”? Conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from it,</b> both that the saliva of a <i>zav</i> transmits impurity by carrying and that contact with the saliva renders impure both the person and his garments.
§ The aforementioned <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>And the nasal fluids</b> of a <i>zav</i> also transmit impurity. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> are these <b>nasal fluids? Rav says:</b> This is referring to fluids <b>that are emitted via the mouth</b> of a person. They are impure <b>because</b> it is <b>impossible for the nasal fluids</b> to flow through the mouth <b>without</b> containing <b>traces of saliva,</b> which are impure. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>even</b> to fluids <b>that are emitted via the nose. Evidently,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>maintains</b> that nasal fluids <b>are</b> categorized as <b>a flow</b> of bodily fluids, <b>and the Merciful One included it</b> among the impure bodily fluids of a <i>zav</i>, by the amplification: “And if one who has an issue spits.”
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to <b>Rav,</b> who maintains that nasal fluids are impure because they contain traces of saliva, this is difficult: <b>Let</b> the mishna <b>also count</b> among the impure bodily fluids of the <i>zav</i> <b>the tears of his eye, as Rav said: He who desires to blind his eye should have a gentile paint [<i>likhḥol</i>]</b> his eye, as the gentile is apt to add a substance that causes blindness. <b>And Levi said: He who desires to die should have a gentile paint</b> his eye, as the gentile is apt to add poison to the paint.
The Gemara continues: <b>And Rav Ḥiyya bar Gurya said: What is the reasoning of Rav, that he did not say</b> like Levi: <b>He who desires to die</b> should have a gentile paint his eye? Rav did not say this because he maintains one can prevent the poisonous substances from killing him, <b>since he can suck</b> the poisonous substances into his mouth by inhaling <b>and emit them via the mouth.</b> This indicates that the fluids of the eye can also be emitted through the mouth, and if so, the tears of a <i>zav</i> should likewise transmit impurity. The Gemara answers: <b>And Rav</b> would say that <b>although the poison [<i>dezihara</i>]</b> placed in one’s eye can <b>exit</b> the body via the mouth, <b>the tears themselves do not exit</b> the body through the mouth.
The Gemara states: With regard to the above dispute between Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There are nine</b> types of <b>fluids</b> of <b>the <i>zav</i>. The sweat, the foul secretion</b> from an infected wound, <b>and the excrement are pure from any</b> form of impurity. The <b>tears</b> that emerge <b>from his eye,</b> the <b>blood from his wound, and the milk of a woman</b> who is a <i>zava</i> all <b>transmit the ritual impurity of liquids,</b> i.e., they render food and liquids impure, as other impure liquids do, in a situation <b>where</b> there is at least <b>a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> of the fluid. <b>But his <i>ziva</i>, his saliva, and his urine</b> all <b>transmit a severe</b> form of <b>ritual impurity.</b> The Gemara comments: The <i>baraita</i> lists many substances, <b>and yet it does not teach</b> that <b>nasal fluids</b> are impure.
<b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>does not teach</b> that nasal fluids are impure, <b>as he could not teach it categorically,</b> since <b>sometimes</b> the nasal fluid <b>comes via the mouth,</b> and is impure, <b>and sometimes it comes via the nose,</b> and is not impure. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> that nasal fluids are impure.
The Gemara responds: <b>And according to your reasoning, does</b> this <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> that <b>his phlegm and his mucus</b> are impure? <b>Rather, he taught</b> that <b>saliva</b> is impure, <b>and</b> this includes the impurity of <b>all</b> substances <b>that are derived from</b> its <b>amplification,</b> e.g., his phlegm and his mucus. <b>Here too,</b> with regard to nasal fluids, the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>his saliva, and</b> this includes <b>all</b> substances <b>that are derived from</b> its <b>amplification,</b> including nasal fluids.
The <i>baraita</i> teaches that in the case of a <i>zav</i> or <i>zava</i>, the tears of their eyes and the blood from their wounds, as well as the milk of a <i>zava</i>, all transmit the ritual impurity of liquids. The Gemara cites the source for these cases of impurity: <b>The tears of his eye</b> are classified as a liquid, <b>as it is written:</b> “You have fed them with the bread of tears, <b>and given them tears to drink in great measure”</b> (Psalms 80:6). <b>And</b> the <b>blood from his wound</b> is classified as a liquid, <b>as it is written: “And he shall drink the blood of the slain”</b> (Numbers 23:24). Although the verse is referring to the blood of a dead person, and not to the blood of a wound, <b>what</b> difference does it make <b>to me</b> if one <b>killed all of him,</b> and <b>what</b> difference does it make <b>to me</b> if one <b>killed part of him,</b> i.e., wounded him? With regard to the <b>milk of a woman,</b> it too is classified as a liquid, <b>as it is written: “And she opened the bottle of milk, and gave him to drink”</b> (Judges 4:19).
The <i>baraita</i> teaches that the urine of a <i>zav</i> transmits a severe form of ritual impurity, as do his <i>ziva</i> and his saliva. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that the <b>urine</b> of a <i>zav</i> is impure? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “When any man has an issue out of his flesh, <b>his issue,</b> it is <b>impure. And this</b> shall be his impurity” (Leviticus 15:2–3). The term “and this” comes <b>to include his urine with regard to</b> a severe form of <b>ritual impurity.</b> The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>And could this not be</b> derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference? If saliva, which comes from a place of purity,</b> i.e., one’s mouth, whose secretions are not usually impure, is nevertheless <b>impure,</b> then with regard to <b>his urine, which comes</b>

Daf 56a

<b>from a place of impurity,</b> the same place that emits <i>ziva</i>, <b>is it not logical that it should be impure?</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: The case of <b>blood that issues from the opening of the penis may prove</b> that this inference is invalid, <b>as</b> the blood <b>comes from a place of impurity and</b> yet <b>it is pure. Likewise, you should not be surprised about this,</b> the urine of a <i>zav</i>, <b>that even though it comes from a place of impurity it should be pure.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “When any man has an issue out of his flesh, <b>his issue,</b> it <b>is impure. And this</b> shall be his impurity” (Leviticus 15:2–3). The term “and this” comes <b>to include his urine with regard to</b> the severe form of <b>ritual impurity.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that blood that issues from the opening of the penis is pure? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning a <i>zav</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>blood that issues from his mouth or from the opening of the penis is impure,</b> like his saliva and urine. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “His issue, it is impure”</b> (Leviticus 15:2). The term “it” is an exclusion, indicating that <b>it,</b> <i>ziva</i>, <b>is impure, but blood that issues from his mouth or from the opening of the penis is not impure; rather, it is pure.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>But</b> perhaps <b>I should reverse</b> the <i>halakhot</i>. One could derive from the amplification “and this” that blood issuing from the penis of the <i>zav</i> is impure, and from the exclusion “it” that his urine is pure. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> Urine, rather than blood, should be included among the impure fluids of the <i>zav</i>, as it is <b>similar to saliva: Just as saliva</b> is a fluid <b>that</b> first <b>gathers together and</b> then <b>comes out</b> of the mouth, <b>so too, all</b> impure fluids are those <b>that gather together and</b> then <b>come out</b> of the body. <b>Blood</b> is therefore <b>excluded, as</b> it <b>does not</b> first <b>gather together and</b> then <b>come out</b> of the body.
The Gemara objects: <b>But there is</b> the case of the <b>milk that</b> is emitted <b>from a woman, which</b> first <b>gathers together and</b> then <b>comes out</b> of the body, and it should therefore transmit a severe form of ritual impurity, like saliva and <i>ziva</i>. <b>And</b> yet <b>the Master said</b> in the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>: The <b>milk of a woman transmits the ritual impurity of liquids.</b> One may infer that with regard to <b>the ritual impurity of liquids, yes,</b> it transmits impurity, <b>but</b> it does <b>not</b> transmit <b>a severe</b> form of <b>ritual impurity.</b>
<b>Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> In order to transmit a severe form of impurity the fluid must be <b>similar to saliva: Just as saliva</b> first <b>gathers together and</b> then <b>comes out</b> of the mouth, <b>and</b> if it is not expectorated <b>it is reabsorbed, so too, all</b> impure fluids first <b>gather together and</b> then <b>come out</b> of the body, <b>and are reabsorbed</b> by the body if they are not emitted. <b>Blood</b> is therefore <b>excluded, as</b> it <b>does not</b> first <b>gather together and</b> then <b>come out</b> of the body. The <b>milk that</b> is emitted <b>from a woman</b> is also <b>excluded, as even though it gathers together and</b> then <b>comes out</b> of the body <b>it cannot be reabsorbed.</b>
The Gemara further objects: <b>But let us derive from</b> the case of <b><i>ziva</i></b> that both blood and breast milk transmit impurity: <b>Just as his <i>ziva</i> does not</b> first <b>gather together and</b> then <b>come out</b> of the body, and yet it <b>transmits impurity, so too, all</b> the fluids of a <i>zav</i> should transmit impurity, even if they do not gather together before they are emitted from the body. <b>Rava said</b> in explanation: <b>One cannot derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the blood and breast milk of a <i>zav</i> or <i>zava</i> <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>his <i>ziva</i>, as</b> the case of <i>ziva</i> is unique <b>in that</b> it <b>causes impurity to others,</b> i.e., to the one who emitted <i>ziva</i>.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And the</b> carcass of <b>a creeping animal</b> transmits impurity when moist but not when dry. <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> With regard to the carcass of <b>a creeping animal that dried up but its skeleton is intact,</b> i.e., its bone structure remains in place, it <b>is ritually impure.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that the items it lists, including the creeping animal, all <b>transmit impurity</b> when they are <b>moist, but they do not transmit impurity</b> when they are <b>dry? Rabbi Zeira said:</b> It is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement of Reish Lakish, that creeping animals transmit impurity even when dry, is referring <b>to</b> a case where <b>all of</b> the bones are intact. By contrast, <b>that</b> ruling of the mishna, that they do not transmit impurity when dry, is referring <b>to</b> a situation where only <b>part of</b> the bones are intact.
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Bisna, says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says:</b> The verse states with regard to creeping animals: “Whoever touches <b>them</b> when they are dead shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:31). One <b>might</b> have thought that the carcasses of creeping animals transmit impurity only if one comes into contact <b>with all of them,</b> i.e., with creeping animals that are completely intact. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And upon whatever any <b>of them</b> falls when they are dead shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:32). The term “any of them” indicates that this <i>halakha</i> applies even if one comes into contact with only part of a creeping animal.
<b>If</b> the <i>halakha</i> is derived from the term <b>“of them,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that even if one comes into contact <b>with a part of them</b> he is rendered impure. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Whoever touches <b>them,”</b> which indicates completely intact creeping animals. The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? <b>Here,</b> where the verse indicates that even part of them transmits impurity, it is referring <b>to a moist</b> creeping animal. <b>There,</b> where the verse teaches that only a complete creeping animal transmits impurity, it is speaking <b>of a dry</b> creature.
<b>Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>these lizards of</b> the city of <b>Meḥoza, when their skeleton is intact</b> they <b>are impure.</b> The dab lizard is one of the creeping animals listed in the Torah. <b>And Reish Lakish says:</b> With regard to the carcass of <b>a creeping animal that was burned but its skeleton is intact,</b> it <b>is ritually impure.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a mishna that indicates a burnt carcass of a creeping animal is pure (<i>Teharot</i> 9:9): In a case where <b>a burnt creeping animal was found on top of</b> a pile of <b>olives, and likewise,</b> if the <b>tattered rag</b> of a <i>zav</i> was found on a pile of olives, the olives and the rag <b>are pure.</b> One is not concerned that the carcass of the creeping animal touched the olives or rag before it was burned, because <b>with regard to all</b> matters of <b>impurity,</b> it is assumed that when the item in question came into contact with the potential sources of impurity, the potential sources of impurity were in the same state <b>as</b> they were at <b>the time they were found,</b> and a burnt carcass does not transmit impurity. <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> It is <b>not difficult; this</b> statement of Reish Lakish refers <b>to</b> a case where <b>all of</b> the bones are intact, whereas <b>that</b> ruling of the mishna is referring <b>to</b> a situation where only <b>part of</b> the bones are intact.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Bisna, says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> When the verse states: “Whoever touches <b>them</b> when they are dead shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:31), one <b>might</b> have thought that creeping animals transmit impurity only if one comes into contact <b>with all of them,</b> i.e., with creeping animals that are completely intact. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And upon whatever any <b>of them</b> falls when they are dead shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:32), indicating that even a part of them transmits impurity.
<b>If</b> the <i>halakha</i> is derived from the term <b>“of them,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that even contact <b>with a part of them</b> transmits impurity. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Whoever touches <b>them.” How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? <b>Here,</b> where the verse teaches that only the complete carcass of a creeping animal transmits impurity, it is referring <b>to a burnt</b> creeping animal. <b>There,</b> where the verse indicates that even a part of them transmits impurity, it is referring <b>to</b> the carcass of a creeping animal <b>that is not burnt.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that the <i>ziva</i> of a <i>zav</i>, the mucus and saliva of a <i>zav</i>, the carcass of a creeping animal, an animal carcass, and semen all <b>transmit impurity</b> when they are <b>moist,</b> but they do not transmit impurity when they are dry. The Gemara cites the sources for these <i>halakhot</i>: The <i>ziva</i> of <b>a <i>zav</i></b> transmits impurity only when moist, <b>as it is written: “His flesh runs</b> with his issue” (Leviticus 15:3), which is referring to a moist discharge. <b>His phlegm and his mucus and his saliva</b> likewise transmit impurity only when moist, <b>as it is written:</b> “And <b>if one who has an issue spits”</b> (Leviticus 15:8), which is referring to a substance <b>that is like saliva,</b> which is moist.
The carcass of <b>a creeping animal</b> transmits impurity only when moist, as <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “Whoever touches them <b>when they are dead</b> shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:31). This indicates that they transmit impurity when they are in a state <b>similar to</b> their state at the time of <b>death,</b> when creatures are still moist. <b>Semen</b> transmits impurity only when moist, as it must be <b>fit to inseminate. An animal carcass</b> transmits impurity only when moist, <b>as it is written:</b> “And <b>if</b> any animal of which you may eat <b>dies,</b> he who touches its carcass shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39), which teaches that the carcass transmits impurity when it is in a state <b>similar to</b> its state at the time of <b>death.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that <b>if one could soak</b> those dry substances in water and restore them to their previous state they would transmit impurity both when moist and when dry. The mishna further teaches that this is referring to soaking them in lukewarm water for a twenty-four-hour period. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b> Does the mishna mean that the soaking must be performed <b>in lukewarm</b> water from <b>the beginning of</b> the soaking until <b>its end, or perhaps</b> it is sufficient if the water is lukewarm at <b>the beginning of</b> the soaking, <b>even if</b> at <b>the end of</b> the soaking the water <b>is not</b> lukewarm?
The Gemara explains: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How much</b> time <b>is their soaking in lukewarm</b> water? <b>Yehuda ben Nekosa says:</b> This is referring to a twenty-four-hour <b>period,</b> and it is sufficient if the water is lukewarm at <b>its beginning, even if it is not</b> lukewarm <b>at its end. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> The water <b>must be lukewarm for</b> the entire twenty-four-hour <b>period.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> With regard to <b>the flesh of a corpse</b> that is dry and cannot be soaked to restore it to its previous state, it is ritually pure. <b>Shmuel says:</b> It <b>is pure from transmitting impurity by</b> the amount of <b>an olive-bulk, but</b> if there is a ladleful of the flesh it <b>transmits the impurity of</b> the <b>decayed</b> flesh of a corpse. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> With regard to <b>the flesh of a corpse that dried up and cannot be soaked and restored to</b> its <b>previous state,</b> it <b>is ritually pure from transmitting impurity by</b> the amount of <b>an olive-bulk, but it is impure</b> with the <b>impurity of</b> the <b>decayed</b> flesh of a corpse.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The carcass of <b>a creeping animal that was found in an alleyway renders</b> pure items <b>impure retroactively.</b> All items that passed through that alleyway <b>from</b> the time about which <b>one may state: I examined this alleyway and there was no</b> carcass of <b>a creeping animal in it, or from</b> the <b>time of</b> the <b>sweeping</b> of the alleyway, are impure.
<b>And likewise,</b> a blood <b>stain that was discovered on</b> the <b>robe</b> of a woman <b>renders</b> her <b>impure retroactively.</b> Any pure items that she handled <b>from</b> the time about which <b>one may state: I examined this robe and there was no</b> blood <b>stain on it, or from the time of the laundering</b> of the robe, are impure.
<b>And</b> the carcass of a creeping animal or a blood stain <b>renders</b> items <b>impure</b> retroactively <b>whether</b> they are still <b>moist</b> or are already <b>dried out. Rabbi Shimon says: The dry</b> one <b>renders</b> items <b>impure retroactively, but the moist</b> one <b>does not render</b> items <b>impure</b> from the aforementioned times, <b>but</b> only <b>from</b> such <b>a time that it could still be moist</b> from then up to the moment it was discovered.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the case of the carcass of a creeping animal that was found in an alleyway, <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: The mishna teaches that any pure items that passed through that alleyway <b>from</b> the <b>time of</b> the <b>sweeping</b> of the alleyway are impure. Does this mean that once the alleyway is swept <b>its presumptive status</b> is that it has been <b>examined,</b> as it is examined during the sweeping and any impure item would have been discovered, and therefore any pure items that passed through the alleyway beforehand remain pure? <b>Or perhaps</b> the mishna means that once the alleyway is swept <b>its presumptive status</b> is that it has been entirely <b>swept,</b> and therefore any creeping animal would have been removed by the sweeping.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> that arises from this dilemma? The Gemara answers: There is a difference in a case <b>where</b> the one who swept the alleyway <b>said he swept</b> it <b>but did not examine</b> it. <b>If you say</b> that items that were present in the alleyway before it was swept remain pure because <b>the presumptive status of</b> a swept alleyway is that it has been <b>examined,</b> in <b>this</b> case the man explicitly said that <b>he did not examine</b> it, so it does not have this presumptive status. By contrast, <b>if you say</b> that the items remain pure because <b>the presumptive status of</b> the alleyway is that it has been completely <b>swept,</b> in <b>this</b> case too it has been <b>swept,</b> and therefore the items that were present earlier remain pure.

Daf 56b

<b>Alternatively,</b> there is a difference between these explanations in a case <b>where</b> the creeping animal <b>was found in a hole</b> in the ground. <b>If you say the presumptive status of</b> a swept alleyway is that it has been <b>examined,</b> it is clear that <b>one who examines</b> the alleyway <b>also examines</b> any <b>holes,</b> and any items that were in the alleyway beforehand should remain pure. By contrast, <b>if you say its presumptive status</b> is that it has been completely <b>swept,</b> this applies only to items that are on the ground, whereas <b>a hole is not</b> considered to have been <b>swept.</b> Consequently, even items that passed through the alleyway before it was swept should be deemed impure.
The mishna teaches: <b>And likewise,</b> a blood <b>stain</b> that was discovered on the robe of a woman renders her impure retroactively. With regard to this <i>halakha</i> as well <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: The mishna states that any pure items the woman handled <b>from</b> the <b>time of laundering</b> are impure. Does this mean that once the robe has been laundered <b>its presumptive status</b> is that it has been <b>examined,</b> as when it is laundered it is examined thoroughly, and any blood stain would have been discovered? <b>Or perhaps</b> the mishna means that <b>its presumptive status</b> is that <b>it is</b> thoroughly <b>laundered,</b> and any blood stain would have been removed by the laundering.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> that arises from this dilemma? The Gemara replies: There is a difference in a case <b>where</b> the person who laundered the robe <b>said he laundered</b> it <b>but did not examine</b> it. <b>If you say its presumptive status</b> is that it has been <b>examined,</b> in <b>this</b> case the man explicitly said that <b>he did not examine</b> the robe, so it does not have this presumptive status. By contrast, <b>if you say its presumptive status</b> is that <b>it is</b> thoroughly <b>laundered,</b> in <b>this</b> case too it has been <b>laundered.</b>
<b>Alternatively,</b> there is a difference between these explanations in a case <b>where</b> the blood stain <b>was found on the side</b> of the robe, in an area where there are folds and stitches. <b>If you say its presumptive status</b> is that it has been <b>examined,</b> it is clear that <b>one who examines</b> the robe <b>also examines the side</b> of the robe, and therefore any items that the woman handled before the robe was laundered should remain pure. By contrast, <b>if you say its presumptive status</b> is that <b>it is</b> thoroughly <b>laundered,</b> this applies only to the main part of the robe, but <b>on</b> its <b>side</b> it <b>is not laundered</b> thoroughly enough to remove a blood stain.
<b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to these two dilemmas? <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir says: For what</b> reason <b>did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that the carcass of <b>a creeping animal that was found in an alleyway renders</b> pure items <b>impure retroactively from</b> the time about which <b>one may state: I examined this alleyway and there was no creeping animal in it, or from</b> the <b>time of</b> the <b>sweeping</b> of the alleyway? It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> there is <b>a presumption with regard to Jewish people</b> that <b>they examine their alleyways at the time of their sweeping. And</b> therefore, <b>if they did not examine</b> the alleyway <b>they retroactively lose</b> the purity of any items that were there from the last time it was examined.
<b>And</b> similarly, <b>for what</b> reason <b>did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that a blood <b>stain that was found on</b> the <b>robe</b> of a woman <b>renders</b> her <b>impure retroactively from</b> the time about which <b>one may state: I examined the robe and there was no</b> blood <b>stain on it, or from the time of the laundering</b> of the robe? It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> there is <b>a presumption with regard to the Jewish women</b> that <b>they examine their robes at the time of their laundering. And</b> therefore, <b>if they did not examine</b> the robe <b>they retroactively lose</b> the purity of any items they handled since it was last examined.
<b>Rabbi Aḥa says:</b> Even in a case where the robe was not examined when it was laundered and a blood stain was subsequently found on it, and it is unknown whether the stain was present before the laundering, there is a remedy to the dilemma: <b>Let her launder it again. If the appearance of</b> the blood stain <b>changes</b> as a result of this laundering <b>it is known that</b> the robe became stained <b>after</b> the previous <b>laundering,</b> which is why the present laundering affected its appearance. Consequently, those pure items that the woman handled before the earlier laundering remain pure. <b>And if</b> the blood stain’s appearance does <b>not</b> change due to the second laundering <b>it is known that</b> the robe became stained <b>before the</b> previous <b>laundering,</b> and therefore the items that she handled before the laundering are impure.
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> One can differentiate between a blood stain that was on the robe before it was laundered and one that stained the robe afterward by inspecting the stain itself. This is because the appearance of a blood <b>stain after the laundering is not similar to</b> the appearance of a blood <b>stain before the laundering, as this</b> stain, from after the laundering, <b>penetrates [<i>makdir</i>]</b> the garment, <b>and that</b> stain, from before the laundering, <b>forms a crust [<i>maglid</i>]</b> that can be scraped off the robe. With regard to the Gemara’s dilemma, one may <b>conclude from</b> Rabbi Meir’s statement that <b>the presumptive status of</b> a swept alleyway or a laundered robe is that it has been <b>examined.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>conclude from it</b> that this is so.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> the carcass of a creeping animal or a blood stain <b>renders</b> items <b>impure</b> retroactively <b>whether</b> they are still <b>moist</b> or are already dried out. Rabbi Shimon says: The dry one renders items impure retroactively, whereas the moist one does not render items impure since the aforementioned times, but only from such a time that it could still be moist from then up to the moment it was discovered. With regard to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The mishna <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to the carcass of <b>a creeping animal, but</b> Rabbi Shimon concedes that <b>a moist</b> blood <b>stain also renders</b> the woman <b>impure retroactively</b> from the time that the robe was examined. This is because one can <b>say</b> the blood stain <b>was dry</b> beforehand <b>and water fell upon it,</b> causing it to become moist.
The Gemara asks: With regard to the moist carcass of <b>a creeping animal as well,</b> one can <b>say it was dried out</b> beforehand <b>and water fell on it.</b> It should therefore render items impure retroactively from the time that the alleyway was swept. The Gemara answers: <b>If it is so, that this is</b> what occurred, the dead creeping animal <b>would be sundered apart</b> and would not have its current appearance.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Any</b> blood <b>stains</b> on garments <b>that come from</b> the town of <b>Rekem are ritually pure,</b> as most of the residents there are gentiles, and the blood stains of gentile women are not ritually impure. <b>Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> those stains <b>impure because</b> in his opinion the residents of Rekem are not gentiles; rather, <b>they are converts</b> whose halakhic status is that of Jews, <b>but they are misguided</b> and do not put away their bloodstained garments. The blood stains on garments <b>that come from among the gentiles are ritually pure.</b> With regard to blood stains on garments that come <b>from among the Jews and from among the Samaritans, Rabbi Meir deems</b> them <b>impure,</b> as they may have come from the Jews. <b>And the Rabbis deem</b> them <b>ritually pure due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> Jews <b>are not suspected of</b> failing to put away <b>their</b> garments on which there are blood <b>stains.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna <b>categorically teaches</b> that any blood stains on garments that come from among the gentiles are ritually pure, thereby indicating that this applies <b>even</b> to garments that come <b>from</b> among the gentile population of <b>Tarmod. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: That is to say, one may accept converts from Tarmod,</b> i.e., there is no concern with regard to whether they are actually Jews of flawed lineage, who may not marry Jews of fit lineage.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But</b> aren’t there <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and the Elders who both say</b> that <b>one may not accept converts from Tarmod?</b> This is due to a concern that the daughters of the ten tribes exiled during the First Temple period might have intermingled with them, and according to Rabbi Yoḥanan the offspring of a Jewish woman and a gentile is a <i>mamzer</i>, who may not marry a Jew of fit lineage.
<b>And if you would say</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan merely infers that this is the opinion of the mishna, as indicated by the term: <b>That</b> is to say, <b>but he</b> himself <b>does not hold accordingly,</b> that is not so. <b>Didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> a principle that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the ruling of <b>an unattributed mishna,</b> as is the case here?
The Gemara answers: <b>They are <i>amora’im</i>, and</b> they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> According to one <i>amora</i>, Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that converts from Tarmod are not accepted, and he did not state that it is a principle that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the ruling of an unattributed mishna. According to another <i>amora</i>, Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the unattributed mishna, and therefore one may accept converts from Tarmod.
§ The mishna teaches with regard to blood stains on garments that come <b>from among the Jews</b> and from among the Samaritans that Rabbi Meir deems them impure, and the Rabbis deem them ritually pure. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, if they deem</b> stains that come <b>from a Jewish</b> woman <b>pure, whose</b> stains <b>do they deem impure?</b>
The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>is incomplete and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching:</b> Everyone agrees that blood stains on garments that come <b>from among the Jews are impure.</b> With regard to blood stains that come <b>from among the Samaritans, Rabbi Meir deems</b> them <b>impure, as</b> he maintains the <b>Samaritans are true converts</b> and have the halakhic status of Jews, whose blood stains are impure. <b>And the Rabbis deem</b> them <b>ritually pure, as</b> they maintain the <b>Samaritans are converts</b> who converted under duress <b>due to</b> the threat posed by <b>lions,</b> and therefore their conversion is void, and their halakhic status is that of gentiles.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why does the mishna state that according to the Rabbis the blood stains of the Samaritans are ritually pure due to the fact <b>that they are not suspected of</b> failing to put away <b>their</b> garments on which there are blood <b>stains?</b> The mishna <b>should</b> state that their blood stains are pure, as they are <b>converts</b> who converted <b>due to</b> the threat of <b>lions.</b>
<b>Rather, this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> Blood stains on garments that come <b>from among the Jews and from among the Samaritans are ritually impure, as</b> everyone agrees the <b>Samaritans are true converts.</b> With regard to blood stains <b>that are found in</b> the <b>towns of Jews, they are pure, as they are not suspected of</b> failing to put away <b>their</b> garments on which there are blood <b>stains, and they</b> certainly <b>put them away.</b> Therefore, the stains necessarily come from gentiles.
The Gemara continues paraphrasing the mishna: With regard to blood stains <b>that are found in</b> the <b>towns of Samaritans, Rabbi Meir deems</b> them <b>impure, as</b> the inhabitants <b>are suspected of</b> failing to put away <b>their</b> garments on which there are blood <b>stains. And the Rabbis deem</b> them <b>pure, as</b> they maintain that even Samaritans <b>are not suspected of</b> failing to put away <b>their</b> garments on which there are blood <b>stains,</b> and the stains are necessarily from gentiles.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All</b> blood <b>stains</b> on garments <b>that are found anywhere</b> where Jews and gentiles reside <b>are ritually pure,</b> since they must not belong to Jews, who put away their stained garments. This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>except for</b> the stained garments <b>that are found in the</b> inner <b>rooms</b> of the house, as these might be garments that the Jews put away there; <b>and</b> except for the stained garments found <b>in proximity to the house of impurity,</b> i.e., the room that women used when they were impure due to menstruation.
<b>The house of impurity of Samaritans imparts</b> the <b>impurity</b> that is imparted by a corpse <b>by means of a tent, due to</b> the fact <b>that they bury the stillborn</b> children <b>there. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The house of impurity of Samaritans does not impart that impurity, as <b>they would not bury</b> a stillborn child there. <b>Rather, they would cast</b> it outside <b>and an animal would drag it</b> away.
Samaritans <b>are deemed credible to state: We buried the stillborn</b> children <b>there,</b> in a certain place, and it transmits ritual impurity; <b>or</b> to state: <b>We did not bury</b> the stillborn children there, and it does not transmit ritual impurity. <b>They are</b> likewise <b>deemed credible to state about an animal whether it</b> previously <b>gave birth</b> or <b>whether it did not</b> previously <b>give birth;</b> and their testimony is accepted with regard to determining whether the animal’s offspring has the status of a firstborn animal, which is sacred. They <b>are</b> also <b>deemed credible</b> to testify <b>about the marking of graves,</b> i.e., that where they marked is deemed a grave and where they did not mark is deemed a place where there is no grave.
<b>But</b> with regard to the following cases, in which the exact location of a grave is unknown, the Samaritans <b>are not deemed credible</b> to testify: They are <b>not</b> deemed credible to testify <b>about the overhanging boughs, nor about the protrusions</b> that jut out of stone fences and cover the ground. If it is unknown which bough or protrusion hangs over a grave, forming a tent that transmits the impurity of a corpse, and if a Samaritan testifies that the grave is not beneath a particular bough or protrusion his testimony is not accepted. <b>And</b> likewise they are <b>not</b> deemed credible to testify <b>about a <i>beit haperas</i>.</b> The Sages issued a decree that in such a case, the area that was plowed is impure as far as one hundred cubits from the original grave, due to the concern that the bones were dispersed by the plow.
<b>This is the principle</b> governing the credibility of Samaritans: In the case of any <b>matter</b> of <i>halakha</i> <b>that they are suspected</b> of not fulfilling, <b>they are not deemed credible</b> to testify <b>about it.</b>

Daf 57a

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the Samaritans do not observe burial customs for stillborn children. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> verse <b>did they interpret</b> as a source for this practice? The Gemara replies that they interpreted the verse: <b>“You shall not remove your fellow’s boundary marker, which was bounded by the first ones, in your inheritance</b> that you shall inherit, in the land that the Lord your God gives you to possess it” (Deuteronomy 19:14).
The Gemara explains: The Sages derived from this verse that it is prohibited to sell one’s ancestral burial ground. In accordance with this interpretation of the verse, the Samaritans derived that <b>any</b> individual <b>who has an inheritance,</b> i.e., who stands to inherit land, <b>has a boundary,</b> i.e., a burial place, whereas <b>any</b> individual <b>who does not have an inheritance</b> in the land, e.g., a stillborn child, <b>does not have a boundary,</b> i.e., a burial place. The Samaritans therefore concluded that the mitzva of burial does not apply to stillborn children.
The mishna teaches that Samaritans <b>are deemed credible to state: We buried</b> the stillborn children in a certain place, or to state that they did not bury the stillborn children there, and that place does not transmit ritual impurity. The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> the Samaritans <b>do not accept</b> the Sages’ interpretation of the verse: <b>“And you shall not put a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14), that one may not cause another to sin. Since they are not concerned about misleading others, why is their testimony accepted? <b>Rabbi Abbahu says:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> a Samaritan <b>priest is standing there,</b> on that spot, which indicates that he genuinely maintains it is not impure with the impurity of a corpse.
The Gemara objects: <b>But perhaps he is an impure priest</b> and therefore he does not refrain from standing in an impure place. The Gemara explains: The mishna is referring to a situation <b>where</b> the priest <b>is holding <i>teruma</i> in his hand,</b> which indicates he is ritually pure. The Gemara further objects: <b>But perhaps it is impure <i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara explains: The mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the priest <b>is partaking of</b> the <i>teruma</i>, which indicates that it is not impure, as it is prohibited to consume impure <i>teruma</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if this is the circumstance, it is obvious that the Samaritan priest’s testimony can be accepted. Then <b>what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: The ruling of the mishna is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that the Samaritans <b>are not knowledgeable with regard to</b> the stages of the <b>formation</b> of an embryo, and they might bury a fetus believing that it is an unformed fetus that does not transmit impurity, when it is actually a forty-day-old fetus, which is impure. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that they are sufficiently knowledgeable, and their testimony is accepted.
The mishna teaches that the Samaritans are <b>deemed credible</b> to state <b>with regard to an animal</b> that it previously gave birth, and its subsequent offspring does not have the sacred status of a firstborn animal. The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> the Samaritans <b>do not accept</b> the Sages’ interpretation of the verse: <b>“And you shall not put a stumbling block before the blind,”</b> that one may not cause another to sin. Why, then, is their testimony accepted? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the Samaritan <b>is shearing and working</b> the offspring of the animal. Since the Samaritans are meticulous with regard to Torah law, it is evident that it is not a firstborn.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if this is the circumstance, <b>what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: The ruling of the mishna is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that the Samaritans <b>are not knowledgeable with regard to a murky</b> discharge emitted from the uterus, which is indicative of a fetus and exempts subsequent births from the mitzva of the firstborn (see <i>Bekhorot</i> 21a). It is possible that the Samaritan mistakenly believes the animal previously emitted a murky discharge and therefore its offspring is not a firstborn. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that they are sufficiently knowledgeable, and their testimony is accepted.
The mishna further teaches that the Samaritans <b>are deemed credible</b> to testify <b>with regard to</b> the <b>marking</b> of graves, as the Samaritans mark their graves, and we rely on their marking as an indication that a corpse is buried there. Therefore, any place where there is no marking is considered ritually pure. The Gemara explains: <b>Even though</b> the marking of graves <b>is</b> required only <b>by rabbinic law,</b> and Samaritans generally do not observe rabbinic law, <b>since it is written</b> in the Bible, the Samaritans <b>are meticulous with regard to it, as it is written:</b> “And those that pass through shall pass through the land, <b>and when one sees a human bone he shall set up a marking by it,</b> until the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog” (Ezekiel 39:15).
The mishna teaches: <b>But</b> with regard to the following cases in which the exact location of a grave is unknown, the Samaritans <b>are not deemed credible</b> to testify: They are <b>not</b> deemed credible to testify <b>about overhanging boughs,</b> nor about the protrusions that jut out of stone fences. The Gemara explains these terms: The term <b>overhanging boughs</b> should be understood <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 8:2): <b>These are overhanging boughs: A tree that hangs over the ground.</b> The term <b>protrusions</b> should be understood <b>as we learned</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Oholot</i> 9:4): <b>Protruding stones that jut out of a fence.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that the Samaritans are not deemed credible to testify about <b>a <i>beit haperas</i>.</b> With regard to a <i>beit haperas</i>, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav Shmuel says:</b> The reason the Sages deemed a <i>beit haperas</i> impure is due to the concern that the bones, but not the flesh of the corpse, were dispersed by the plow throughout the field. The <i>halakha</i> is that a bone transmits impurity by carrying or by contact, if it is at least the size of a barley grain, but it does not transmit impurity by means of a tent. Therefore, if <b>a person</b> is carrying ritually pure items, or if he wishes to remain ritually pure so that he may consume consecrated items, and yet he must pass through a <i>beit haperas</i>, he <b>may blow</b> on the earth of the <b><i>beit haperas</i></b> before each step, so that if there is a bone beneath the dust he will expose it and avoid it. <b>And</b> in this manner he may <b>walk</b> across the area while remaining ritually pure, even though he might step over a bone.
<b>Rav Yehuda bar Ami says in the name of Rav Yehuda: A <i>beit haperas</i> that has been trodden</b> underfoot by many people <b>is pure,</b> as it may be assumed that any bone fragments at least as large as a barley grain that were on the surface were either broken or removed. <b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who plows a graveyard, this</b> individual thereby <b>renders</b> it <b>a <i>beit haperas</i>. And to what</b> extent <b>does he render</b> it a <i>beit haperas</i>, i.e., how far does the concern apply that bones might have been dispersed? The field is rendered a <i>beit haperas</i> to the extent of <b>a full furrow [<i>ma’ana</i>], one hundred cubits</b> by one hundred cubits, which is the <b>area</b> required for sowing <b>four <i>se’a</i></b> of seed. <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The area rendered a <i>beit haperas</i> is the area required for sowing <b>five</b> <i>se’a</i> of seed.
With regard to the ruling of the mishna that the Samaritans are not deemed credible to testify about a <i>beit haperas</i>, the Gemara asks: <b>And aren’t they deemed credible? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a field in which a grave was lost,</b> which has the status of a <i>beit haperas</i>, <b>a Samaritan is deemed credible to say: There is no grave there?</b>
The <i>baraita</i> explains: This is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he is not</b> considered to be <b>testifying</b> about a case of uncertain impurity; <b>rather,</b> he is testifying <b>about</b> the location of the <b>grave itself,</b> which is a matter of Torah law, and the Samaritans are deemed credible with regard to a matter of Torah law. Likewise, in the case of <b>a tree that is hanging over the ground,</b> a Samaritan <b>is deemed credible to say: There is no grave beneath it, as he is testifying only about</b> the location of the <b>grave itself.</b> This indicates that the Samaritans are deemed credible with regard to overhanging boughs and protrusions.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> in explanation: The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the Samaritan <b>is walking</b> to <b>and fro over the entire</b> area, and therefore if there was a grave there he would certainly have become impure. Consequently, one may rely on his statement with regard to the purity of the place. By contrast, the mishna is speaking of a case where the Samaritan did not traverse the entire area, and therefore his testimony is not accepted, as they are not meticulous with regard to cases of uncertainty.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> it is obvious that his testimony is credible, and <b>what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: The ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that perhaps a narrow <b>strip</b> of land, which is called by the same name as this field, <b>extends</b> into a nearby field, and the Samaritan presumes the grave is located in that strip of land. If so, even if the Samaritan traversed the entire field his testimony cannot be accepted, as he traversed the field because he considered it merely a case of uncertain impurity. The <i>baraita</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that if the Samaritan traverses the entire field his testimony is accepted, as this concern is not an issue.
The mishna teaches: <b>This is the principle</b> governing the credibility of Samaritans: In the case of any matter of <i>halakha</i> that they are suspected of not fulfilling, they are not deemed credible to testify about it. The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the term: <b>This is the principle?</b> The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to add</b> that Samaritans are not deemed credible with regard to Shabbat <b>boundaries,</b> i.e., to say that a Shabbat boundary extends until a certain point, as the <i>halakha</i> of Shabbat boundaries applies by rabbinic law. <b>And</b> likewise, the Samaritans are not deemed credible with regard to the status of <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation</b> in idol worship, as the Samaritans do not refrain from drinking wine touched by a gentile.

Daf 57b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A woman <b>who sees</b> a blood <b>stain on her flesh adjacent to</b> her <b>vagina [<i>beit haturpa</i>],</b> i.e., a place where blood that originated in her vagina could be found, <b>becomes ritually impure,</b> as there is a concern that it originated in the uterus and is menstrual blood. <b>And</b> if it was discovered on her flesh in an area <b>not adjacent to</b> her <b>vagina</b> she remains <b>ritually pure,</b> as it certainly did not originate in the uterus. If the stain was discovered <b>on her heel or on the tip of her large toe,</b> although it is not adjacent to her vagina she is <b>ritually impure,</b> as blood from the uterus could have reached there.
In a case where the stain was discovered <b>on her leg or on her feet,</b> if it was <b>on the inner</b> side she is <b>ritually impure,</b> as blood from the uterus could have reached there. If it was <b>on the outer</b> side she is <b>ritually pure, and</b> if it was <b>on the sides,</b> either <b>from here,</b> i.e., on the front of her leg or foot, <b>or from there,</b> i.e., on the back of her leg or foot, she is also <b>ritually pure,</b> as blood from the uterus could not have reached there.
In a case where the woman <b>saw</b> a blood stain <b>on her robe,</b> if it was <b>from the belt and below</b> she is <b>ritually impure,</b> as blood from the uterus could have reached there; if it was <b>from the belt and above</b> she is <b>ritually pure.</b> In a case where <b>she saw</b> the stain <b>on the</b> end of the <b>sleeve of the robe, if</b> the sleeve can <b>reach adjacent to</b> her <b>vagina</b> she is <b>ritually impure; and if not,</b> i.e., if the stain is in a place on the sleeve that does not reach adjacent to the vagina, she is <b>ritually pure.</b>
If it was a robe which <b>she would remove and with which she would cover</b> herself <b>at night, wherever</b> on the robe <b>that the stain is found,</b> the stain renders her <b>ritually impure, due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the robe <b>moves</b> while the woman is asleep and therefore the blood could have originated in the uterus. <b>And likewise with regard to a kerchief [<i>bapoleyos</i>],</b> no matter where the blood is found on the kerchief, the woman is impure.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the cases discussed in the mishna concerning a blood stain found on a woman, <b>Shmuel says:</b> If a woman <b>examined the ground</b> beneath her to see if it was clean from blood and other substances, and she found nothing, <b>and</b> subsequently she <b>sat upon it and</b> then <b>found blood on it,</b> although it might be assumed that this blood came from her, <b>she is ritually pure.</b> The reason is <b>as it is stated:</b> “And her issue <b>in her flesh</b> shall be blood, she shall be in her menstrual state seven days” (Leviticus 15:19). This verse teaches that a woman does not become impure <b>unless she senses,</b> i.e., experiences some type of sensation, <b>in her flesh</b> that she emitted blood from her uterus. Since this woman did not sense an emission of blood, she is pure.
The Gemara asks: How can Shmuel interpret the verse in this manner? After all, <b>he requires this</b> term: <b>“In her flesh,”</b> to teach a different <i>halakha</i>, <b>that</b> a woman <b>becomes impure</b> by finding blood <b>inside</b> her body <b>just as</b> by seeing blood <b>outside</b> her body, i.e., provided that the blood is uterine blood, even if it is currently situated inside her vaginal canal, she is impure. The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> if it serves to teach only that blood inside is like blood outside, <b>let the verse say: In the flesh. What</b> is the reason that the verse states: <b>“In her flesh”? Conclude from</b> this term that a woman does not become impure <b>unless she senses in her flesh.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And still,</b> Shmuel <b>requires</b> the term <b>“in her flesh”</b> to teach that she is impure only if the blood touches her flesh, <b>and not</b> through blood found <b>in a gestational sac, nor</b> through blood found <b>in</b> an amorphous <b>piece</b> of tissue that she emitted. The Gemara answers: <b>Conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from</b> this verse, as the plain meaning of the term teaches all these <i>halakhot</i>.
With regard to the opinion of Shmuel, the Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a mishna at the beginning of the next chapter (59b): In the case of <b>a woman who is urinating and sees blood</b> intermingled with the urine, <b>Rabbi Meir says: If</b> she urinates while <b>she is standing</b> she is <b>ritually impure,</b> as the blood could have originated in the uterus. <b>And if she is sitting</b> she is <b>ritually pure,</b> as it is clear that the blood is from a wound.
The Gemara analyzes this mishna: <b>What are the circumstances? If she sensed</b> while urinating, then in the case where <b>she is sitting, why is she ritually pure,</b> according to Shmuel? <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where she did not sense</b> while urinating? <b>And</b> yet the mishna <b>teaches</b> that if she urinates while <b>she is standing</b> she is <b>ritually impure.</b> This indicates that her status does not depend on her sensing, which contradicts the statement of Shmuel.
The Gemara answers: This affords no proof, as the mishna is <b>actually</b> referring to a case <b>where she sensed</b> while urinating, <b>and</b> yet since this feeling accompanied urination, one might <b>say</b> it <b>was the sensation of urine.</b> Consequently, if she urinated while <b>standing,</b> the <b>urine would return to</b> her <b>uterus and bring blood</b> with it. <b>But</b> if she urinated while <b>sitting</b> the urine cannot return to the uterus and therefore she is <b>pure,</b> as the sensation is attributed to her urine.
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the mishna below (58b): With regard to <b>an examination cloth that was placed beneath the pillow and blood was</b> later <b>found on</b> the cloth, and it is unclear whether it is the blood of an examination or the blood of a louse that was crushed beneath it, <b>if</b> the stain is <b>round</b> it is <b>ritually pure.</b> There is no concern that this blood might have come from her examination, as a woman examines through an act of wiping and a stain produced in this manner would not be round. <b>And if</b> the stain is <b>elongated</b> it is <b>ritually impure,</b> as this shape can be formed by an examination.
The Gemara analyzes the mishna: <b>What are the circumstances? If she sensed,</b> then in the case where the stain is <b>round why</b> is it <b>pure? Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where she did not sense? And</b> yet the mishna <b>teaches</b> that <b>an elongated</b> stain is <b>impure.</b> This contradicts the opinion of Shmuel that a woman is rendered impure only if she sensed.
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the mishna is <b>actually</b> referring to a case <b>where she sensed, but</b> since she also performed an examination one might <b>say</b> this <b>was the sensation of the examination cloth.</b> Consequently, if the stain was <b>elongated,</b> as appropriate for a stain produced by an examination, the blood <b>certainly came from her body,</b> whereas if the stain was <b>round</b> it is <b>pure,</b> as this is not the usual appearance of a stain from an examination.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another mishna (14a): If blood <b>was found on his,</b> i.e., the husband’s, examination cloth following intercourse, the woman and her husband are both <b>ritually impure</b> for seven days, in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> of a menstruating woman and one who engages in intercourse with her, <b>and they are</b> each <b>liable to</b> bring a sin <b>offering</b> for unwittingly performing an action punishable with excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>]. If blood <b>was found on her</b> cloth <b>immediately</b> after intercourse, the woman and her husband are likewise <b>ritually impure</b> for seven days <b>and are</b> each <b>liable to</b> bring a sin <b>offering.</b> If blood <b>was found on her</b> swatch <b>after time</b> passed, they are both <b>ritually impure due to uncertainty,</b> as it is possible that the blood appeared only after intercourse, <b>and they are exempt from</b> bringing <b>the</b> sin <b>offering.</b>
The Gemara analyzes this mishna: <b>What are the circumstances? If</b> it is referring to a situation <b>where she sensed,</b> then in the case where blood was found on her cloth <b>after time</b> passed, <b>why are they exempt from</b> bringing <b>the</b> sin <b>offering? Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where she did not sense? And</b> yet the mishna <b>teaches</b> that if blood <b>was found on her</b> cloth <b>immediately</b> after intercourse, they are <b>ritually impure</b> for seven days <b>and are</b> each <b>liable to</b> bring a sin <b>offering.</b> Once again, this contradicts the opinion of Shmuel. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the mishna is <b>actually</b> referring to a case <b>where she sensed, but</b> since she was engaging in intercourse at the time, one might <b>say</b> this <b>was the sensation</b> of the male <b>organ.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>You are found</b> to <b>say</b> that there are <b>three uncertainties</b> involving cases where blood is found <b>on a woman</b> or her garments. If a stain is discovered <b>on her flesh</b> and there is <b>uncertainty whether it is impure or pure,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that it is <b>impure.</b> If it is found <b>on her robe</b> and there is <b>uncertainty whether it is impure or pure,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that it is <b>pure. And</b> in the case of a woman whose status as a menstruating woman is uncertain, <b>with regard to</b> her <b>touching</b> items <b>and with regard to</b> her <b>moving</b> items, one should <b>follow the majority.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>Follow the majority,</b> with regard to this woman of uncertain status? Does this <b>not</b> mean that <b>if</b> for <b>the majority of her days</b> she is in a state of <b>ritual impurity,</b> as she emits impure blood on many days, then <b>she is</b> considered <b>impure</b> even when her status is uncertain? <b>And</b> since this <i>baraita</i> does not differentiate between cases where she did and did not sense, the ruling that one follows the majority, and that she is impure, evidently applies <b>even though she did not sense,</b> which contradicts the opinion of Shmuel.
The Gemara answers: <b>No</b> proof may be brought from here, as this is what the <i>baraita</i> means: <b>If</b> on <b>the majority of her days</b> this woman <b>sees</b> blood accompanied <b>by a sensation, she is impure,</b> despite the fact that she is uncertain whether she had a sensation, <b>as</b> one can <b>say she sensed</b> on this occasion as well, <b>but</b> it was <b>not on her mind,</b> i.e., she did not pay attention to it at the time.
Before returning to the opinion of Shmuel, the Gemara analyzes the other clauses of this <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> above: If a stain is discovered <b>on her flesh</b> and there is <b>uncertainty whether it is impure or pure,</b> it is <b>impure;</b> if it is found <b>on her robe</b> and there is <b>uncertainty whether it is impure or pure,</b> it is <b>pure.</b> The juxtaposition of these two cases indicates that the blood is found in the same area in both instances.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? If</b> the blood was discovered <b>from the belt and below,</b> then when it was found <b>on her robe why is she pure? But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: In a case where the woman saw a blood stain on her robe, if it was <b>from the belt and below</b> she is <b>ritually impure? And if</b> the blood was <b>from the belt and above,</b> then if it was discovered <b>on her flesh why is she impure? But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that if <b>she saw blood on her flesh</b> in an area <b>not adjacent to</b> her <b>vagina</b> she remains <b>ritually pure?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the blood was discovered <b>from the belt and below, and if you wish, say</b> instead that it was found <b>from the belt and above.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the blood was found <b>from the belt and below,</b> as the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a situation where the blood can be attributed to an external factor, <b>e.g.,</b> a case <b>where she passed through a marketplace of butchers [<i>tabbaḥim</i>].</b> Consequently, if the blood is found <b>on her flesh</b> it is assumed that <b>it came from her body, as, if it came from the</b> outside <b>world, it should have been found on her robe</b> as well. If it is discovered <b>on her robe</b> it is assumed that <b>it came from the</b> outside <b>world, as, if it came from her body, it should have been found on her flesh</b> as well.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the blood was found <b>from the belt and above,</b> and the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a situation where it is possible the blood came from her body, <b>e.g.,</b> a case <b>where she jumped</b> backward. Therefore, if the blood is found <b>on her flesh it certainly came from her body, as, if it came from the</b> outside <b>world, it should have been found on her robe</b> as well. And if it is discovered <b>on her robe</b> the assumption is that <b>it came from</b> the outside <b>world, as, if it came from her body, it should have been found on her flesh</b> as well.
The Gemara raises an objection from the <i>baraita</i> to the opinion of Shmuel: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that if a stain is discovered <b>on her flesh</b> and there is <b>uncertainty whether it is impure or pure,</b> it is <b>impure, and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though she did not sense,</b> which contradicts the opinion of Shmuel. <b>And furthermore, we learned</b> in the mishna that a woman <b>who sees</b> a blood <b>stain on her flesh adjacent to</b> her <b>vagina becomes ritually impure, and</b> this is apparently the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though she did not sense. Rav Yirmeya of Difti says:</b> The ruling of Shmuel that a woman must sense in order to be rendered impure applies only by Torah law. But <b>Shmuel concedes that</b> in all the cases cited above, where it is indicated that a woman is impure despite the fact that she did not sense, <b>she is impure</b>

Daf 58a

<b>by rabbinic law.</b> Accordingly, Shmuel agrees that if she examined the ground, found it clean, sat upon it, and later found blood, even if she did not sense that she emitted blood she is impure by rabbinic law.
<b>Rav Ashi said: Shmuel said</b> this woman is pure even by rabbinic law, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya, as we learned</b> in a mishna (59b) that <b>Rabbi Neḥemya says: Any item that is not susceptible to ritual impurity,</b> e.g., the ground, <b>is not susceptible to</b> ritual impurity due to blood <b>stains.</b> This is because the decree of impurity of blood stains was limited to items susceptible to ritual impurity. According to Rav Ashi, all the sources cited above that indicate she is impure even if she did not sense an emission are referring to cases where the stain was found on an item that is susceptible to ritual impurity.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ashi</b> with regard to Shmuel’s opinion, <b>that is</b> why Shmuel <b>says</b> the woman examined <b>the ground</b> beneath her, as the ground is not susceptible to ritual impurity. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yirmeya, why</b> does Shmuel refer <b>specifically</b> to <b>the ground?</b> The same <i>halakha</i> should apply <b>even</b> if she sat on <b>a cloak</b> and did not sense an emission of blood. The Gemara answers that Shmuel <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>It is not necessary</b> to state that if a woman examined <b>a cloak,</b> found it pure, sat upon it, and then saw a blood stain on it, she is pure. The reason is <b>that</b> it is <b>not</b> easy to <b>examine</b> a cloak <b>well,</b> due to its creases, <b>and</b> therefore <b>there is</b> room <b>to say</b> the stain on the cloak <b>came from the</b> outside <b>world,</b> i.e., from some external factor. <b>Rather, even</b> in the case of the <b>ground, which</b> one can <b>examine well</b> and therefore <b>there is</b> room <b>to say</b> the stain on the ground must have <b>come from her body</b> when she sat upon it, Shmuel teaches that the blood is nevertheless <b>ritually pure.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: If a stain was discovered on her heel or on the tip of her large <b>toe,</b> although it is not adjacent to her vagina <b>she is ritually impure,</b> as blood from the uterus could have reached there. The Gemara comments: <b>Granted,</b> when blood is found on <b>her heel</b> she is impure, as <b>it is wont to touch that place,</b> her vagina, when she kneels. <b>But</b> if the blood is discovered <b>on the tip of her large toe, what is the reason</b> she is thereby rendered impure? <b>And if you would say</b> the reason is that <b>sometimes</b> the tip of one large toe might <b>touch her heel,</b> i.e., the heel of the other foot, <b>do we presume</b> that <b>ritual impurity</b> travels <b>from place to place?</b> Since that is not presumed, the stain on the large toe of one foot cannot be presumed to come from the heel of the other foot.
The Gemara cites the source of this principle. <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman <b>had a wound on her neck</b> in an area <b>where she can attribute</b> the blood she found adjacent to her vagina to that wound, <b>she may attribute</b> the blood to the wound and she is pure. But if the wound was <b>on her shoulder,</b> which is a place <b>where she cannot attribute</b> the blood she found adjacent to her vagina to that wound, <b>she may not attribute</b> it to the wound, and she is ritually impure.
The Gemara explains the proof from the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> it is clear from this <i>baraita</i> that <b>we do not say</b> that <b>perhaps she took</b> blood from her wounded shoulder <b>in her hand and brought it there,</b> near her vagina. <b>Rather,</b> this is the reason for the ruling of the mishna: <b>The tip of her large toe is different, as when she walks it might happen</b> that the tip of this toe is positioned under her vagina and blood drips onto it from there. For this reason she is rendered impure by a stain on that toe.
The Gemara asks: <b>And do we not presume</b> that <b>ritual impurity</b> travels <b>from place to place? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If blood <b>was found on the joints of her fingers</b> on the back of her hand <b>she is impure,</b> despite the fact that blood from her source is not usually found on that part of her hand <b>because hands are active?</b>
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? Is it <b>not due to</b> the fact <b>that we say she examined with one hand and</b> then <b>touched</b> the back <b>of the other hand?</b> If so, this indicates that ritual impurity is presumed to travel from place to place. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the reason she is impure when blood is found on the back of her hand is that <b>her hand is different, as</b> with regard to the <b>entire</b> hand, including the back, it might <b>happen that it touched</b> the vagina,as one’s hands are active.
§ The mishna teaches: In a case where the stain was discovered <b>on her leg or on her feet,</b> if it was <b>on the inner</b> side she is ritually impure, as blood from the uterus could have reached there. If it was on the outer side of the leg or foot she is ritually pure. The Gemara asks: With regard to the term: <b>On the inner</b> side, <b>until where</b> does it extend? The students of <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai said: Until the place of the joint [<i>mekom ḥavak</i>]</b> of the thigh and shin, the ligaments on the inside of the kneecap.
In this regard, <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Is <b>the place of the joint</b> itself considered <b>as</b> part of <b>the inner</b> side <b>or as</b> part of <b>the outer</b> side? <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as Rav Ketina</b> explicitly <b>teaches:</b> The inner side extends <b>until the place of the joint, and the joint itself</b> is considered <b>as</b> part of <b>the inner</b> side. The Gemara adds that <b>Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rav Avya, teaches it explicitly</b> that the students of <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai</b> themselves <b>said:</b> The inner side extends <b>until the place of the joint, and the joint itself</b> is considered <b>as</b> part of <b>the inner</b> side.
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b> If the stain on a woman’s body was in the shape <b>of a bracelet, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Likewise, if it was in the shape <b>of a straight line, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If it was not in a single defined shape but was <b>a series of drops, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Furthermore, if the stain extended <b>along the width of her thigh, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is there a concern in these cases that the blood might have come from her uterus?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: If a stain is discovered <b>on her flesh</b> and there is <b>uncertainty whether it is impure or pure,</b> it is <b>impure. What, is it not</b> that the case of blood found <b>on her flesh</b> is referring to <b>a case like this,</b> i.e., those cases mentioned by Rabbi Yirmeya, and therefore she is impure? The Gemara answers: There is <b>no</b> proof from here, as <b>perhaps</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a stain <b>shaped like a strip</b> along the length of her thigh, as this is the usual form of a stain from the vagina.
The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain woman who discovered blood in the warp</b> on the loom where she was weaving. She was concerned that while she was weaving, the threads of the warp might have come between her legs and been stained. <b>She came before Rabbi Yannai</b> to inquire about the status of this blood. Rabbi Yannai <b>said to her: Let her go and come,</b> i.e., she should go and weave in her usual manner. Since this involves a repetitive action, it will soon become clear whether the threads stretch between her legs.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>one does not</b> rely on <b>repeated</b> actions <b>with regard to ritually pure</b> items? Since the second action might not precisely mimic the first it cannot be relied upon to determine ritual-purity status. The Gemara answers that <b>when we say one does not</b> rely on <b>repeated</b> actions it is only in cases where it would lead <b>to a leniency. But</b> if it leads <b>to a stringency,</b> as in this case where the woman is currently pure, since the blood was not found on her body or her garments <b>one does</b> rely on <b>repeated</b> actions. If the repeated action indicates that the threads of the warp come between her legs while weaving, she is impure.
§ The mishna teaches: If it was a robe that <b>she would remove</b> and cover herself with at night, no matter where on the robe the stain is found, she is ritually impure because the robe moves while the woman is asleep, and therefore the blood could have originated in the uterus. The Gemara comments: It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei, said:</b> With regard to <b>this matter</b> of blood found on a robe worn at night, <b>I issued a prohibitive ruling in the city of Rome. And when I came to the Sages in the south</b> of Eretz Yisrael <b>they said to me: You issued a proper ruling.</b>
With regard to blood discovered on a robe, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a tall</b> woman <b>who wore the robe of a short</b> woman without first examining it to see if it was clean of stains, <b>and</b> likewise <b>a short</b> woman <b>who wore the robe of a tall</b> woman, if a stain was subsequently found on the robe and it is unknown from which woman it came, the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: <b>If</b> the location of the stain <b>reaches adjacent to the vagina of the tall</b> woman <b>they are both ritually impure.</b> The reason is that in this case it certainly reached that area of the short woman. <b>And if</b> it does <b>not</b> reach adjacent to the vagina of the tall woman, <b>the tall</b> woman <b>is pure,</b> as the stain is definitely not from her, <b>and the short</b> woman <b>is impure.</b>
It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: If a woman <b>examined her robe</b> and did not find a stain, <b>and</b> then <b>lent it to another</b> woman, after which a stain was discovered on the robe, what is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>She,</b> the woman who lent the robe, <b>is pure, and the other</b> woman, the one who borrowed the robe, <b>may attribute</b> the stain <b>to</b> the woman who lent the robe to her, i.e., she may say that she does not rely on the lender’s examination. <b>Rav Sheshet said</b> in explanation of this <i>baraita</i>: <b>And we learn</b> this ruling that the borrower can say she does not rely on the lender only <b>with regard to the matter of</b> a monetary <b>judgment</b> as to which of the women must pay for the laundering of the robe. <b>But with regard to the matter of ritual impurity, she,</b> the lender, <b>is pure, and the other</b> woman, the borrower, <b>is impure.</b>

Daf 58b

The Gemara asks: In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>two women who were occupied with one</b> slaughtered <b>bird, and</b> the bird <b>contained only</b> an amount of <b>blood</b> capable of producing a stain as big <b>as a <i>sela</i></b> coin, <b>and</b> blood the size <b>of a <i>sela</i> was found on this</b> woman <b>and</b> blood the size <b>of a <i>sela</i></b> was found <b>on that</b> woman, <b>they are both impure,</b> despite the fact that the blood of one of them can be attributed to the bird. Likewise, in the case of Rav Sheshet the lender should be impure as well, as she might not have examined the robe properly. The Gemara answers: <b>There it is different, as there is an additional <i>sela</i>.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a woman who <b>wore three robes,</b> one on top of the other, <b>that had been examined by her</b> for blood stains, and she subsequently found a stain on one of the robes, <b>if she can attribute</b> the blood on the robe to an external source, <b>she may attribute</b> it to that source, and she is pure. <b>And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if the stain was <b>on the lower</b> robe, closest to her skin. But if she <b>cannot</b> reasonably <b>attribute</b> the blood to an external factor <b>she may not attribute</b> it to an external factor, and she is impure, <b>and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if the stain was <b>on the upper</b> robe.
The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: <b>How so?</b> If <b>she passed through a marketplace of butchers,</b> where blood could have sprayed on her clothes, <b>she may attribute</b> a stain on her garment to the butchers and she is pure, <b>even</b> if the stain was <b>on the lower</b> robe. If <b>she did not pass through a marketplace of butchers</b> or anywhere else with a lot of blood, then <b>even</b> if the stain was <b>on the upper</b> robe she <b>may not attribute</b> the blood to an external source and she is impure.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And</b> a woman who discovers a blood stain on her body or her garment <b>may attribute</b> its existence <b>to any matter to which she can attribute</b> it: If she <b>slaughtered a domesticated animal, an undomesticated animal, or a bird;</b> or if she <b>was occupied with</b> the removal of blood <b>stains</b> from the garments of other women or from her own garment, from any source, such as blood that originated from a wound elsewhere on her body or even her own menstrual blood from a prior menstrual cycle; <b>or if she sat alongside</b> others <b>who were occupied with</b> removing blood stains; or if <b>she killed a louse;</b> in all of these cases, <b>that</b> woman <b>may attribute</b> the blood stain <b>to it.</b>
<b>How large</b> a stain may a woman <b>attribute</b> to a louse? <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says:</b> It can be <b>up to</b> the area <b>of a split bean. And</b> she may attribute the stain to a louse <b>even if she does not</b> remember that <b>she killed</b> it. <b>And she may attribute</b> the blood stain <b>to her son or to her husband</b> in a case where one of them is near her and has a wound. Furthermore, <b>if</b> the woman herself <b>has a wound,</b> even if the wound scabbed over and is no longer bleeding, <b>but it can reopen and bleed, that</b> woman <b>may attribute</b> the blood stain to that wound.
There was <b>an incident involving one woman who came before Rabbi Akiva. She said to him: I saw</b> a blood <b>stain.</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>said to her: Perhaps</b> there <b>was a wound on your</b> body? <b>She said to him: Yes,</b> there was a wound <b>and it healed. He said to her:</b> Was it <b>perhaps</b> a wound that <b>could reopen and bleed? She said to him: Yes</b> it was. <b>And Rabbi Akiva deemed her ritually pure.</b>
Rabbi Akiva <b>saw his students looking at each other,</b> wondering why he ruled leniently in this case. Rabbi Akiva <b>said to them: What</b> in this <b>matter is difficult in your eyes?</b> The reason I ruled this way is <b>that the Sages did not state the matter</b> of the impurity of blood stains in order <b>to be stringent; rather,</b> they instituted this impurity in order <b>to be lenient, as it is stated: “And if a woman has an issue, and her issue in her flesh shall be blood”</b> (Leviticus 15:19), from which it is derived that by Torah law, <b>“blood”</b> deems her impure, <b>but not a stain.</b> Impurity from a blood stain was instituted by the Sages, and they rule leniently in any case where the stain can be attributed to another source.
With regard to <b>an examination cloth that was placed beneath the pillow and blood was found on</b> the cloth, and it is unclear whether it is the blood of an examination or the blood of a louse that was crushed beneath it, if the stain is <b>round</b> the woman is <b>ritually pure,</b> as an examination to determine whether a woman is menstruating would not leave a round stain. If the stain is <b>elongated</b> the woman is <b>ritually impure;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that a woman who discovers a blood stain on her body or her garment may attribute its existence to any matter to which she can attribute it. The Gemara notes: <b>We learn</b> in the mishna <b>that which the Sages taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>An incident</b> occurred involving a blood stain found on a woman’s garment, <b>and Rabbi Meir attributed</b> it <b>to an eye salve [<i>bekilor</i>]</b> that the woman had previously handled, <b>and</b> likewise, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>attributed</b> a stain <b>to the sap of a sycamore</b> tree the woman had touched.
§ The mishna teaches: Or if she was occupied with the removal of blood stains from the garments of other women or from her own garment, from any source, such as blood that originated from a wound elsewhere on her body or even her own menstrual blood from a prior menstrual cycle; <b>or if she sat</b> alongside others who were occupied with removing blood stains. The Gemara infers: If she knows for certain that <b>she sat</b> alongside those occupied with removing blood stains, <b>yes,</b> she may attribute blood to this source. But if she does <b>not</b> know for certain that <b>she sat</b> alongside those who were removing blood stains, but knows only that she was in the same area as they were, she may <b>not</b> attribute blood to this source.
Again the Gemara comments: <b>We learn</b> in the mishna <b>that which the Sages taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman <b>passed through a marketplace of butchers</b> and it is <b>uncertain whether</b> blood from the marketplace <b>sprayed on her</b> or <b>whether</b> it did <b>not spray on her, she may attribute</b> a stain to the butchers. But if she is <b>uncertain whether she passed by</b> the marketplace or <b>whether</b> she did <b>not pass by, she is</b> deemed <b>impure</b> and may not attribute it to that source. In this case as well, only if she is certain that she was in a circumstance to which she can attribute the blood may she attribute it to that cause.
§ The mishna teaches that if <b>she killed a louse</b> she may attribute the blood stain to it. The Gemara infers: If she <b>killed</b> a louse, <b>yes,</b> she may attribute blood to it, but if she <b>did not kill</b> a louse she may <b>not</b> attribute blood to it. The Gemara asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in <b>the mishna?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>it is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman <b>killed</b> a louse before finding blood, <b>she may attribute</b> blood to it. If <b>she did not kill</b> a louse <b>she may not attribute</b> blood to it; this is <b>the statement of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. And the Rabbis say: Both</b> in <b>this</b> case <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case <b>she may attribute</b> blood to a louse.
<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said</b> there is a difficulty with regard to both his opinion and that of the Rabbis: <b>According to my statement,</b> that a woman may attribute a stain only to a creature she actually killed, <b>there is no limit; and according to the statement of my colleagues,</b> who rule that she may attribute a stain to a louse even if she had not killed one, <b>there is no end.</b>
Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel explains: <b>According to my statement, there is no limit</b> to the size of the stain she found, <b>as</b> she is impure even if it is as small as a mustard seed. Consequently, <b>you have no woman who is pure to her husband, as you have no bed of any sort on which there are not several drops of blood of a louse.</b> Since I rule that a woman may attribute blood to a louse only if she previously killed one, all women will be in a state of impurity to their husbands.
By contrast, <b>according to the statement of my colleagues there is no end</b> to the advantage their ruling provides to women, <b>because</b> if their ruling is accepted <b>you have no woman who is not pure to her husband, as you have no sheet of any sort on which there are not several blood drops,</b> and every woman can attribute all these drops to a louse, even if she had not killed one.
Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel continues: <b>But the statement of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus appears</b> to be more correct <b>than my statement and their statement, as</b> Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus <b>would say: How large</b> a stain may a woman <b>attribute</b> to a louse? It can be <b>up to</b> the area <b>of a split bean. And</b> therefore <b>we concede to</b> his opinion and accept <b>his statement.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say</b> that a woman <b>may attribute</b> blood to a louse whether or not she killed one, <b>how large</b> can the stain be? After all, some stains are far bigger than those produced by a louse. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: She may attribute</b> a stain <b>to a bedbug,</b> which has more blood than a louse, <b>and</b> this applies to any stain whose size is <b>up to</b> the width <b>of a lupine</b> seed<b>.</b>
The Gemara continues to discuss the matter of the bedbug. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>This bedbug, its length</b> is <b>equal to its width, and its taste is like its</b> foul <b>smell. A covenant is made with it,</b> i.e., it is a law of nature, <b>that anyone who squeezes it</b> will <b>smell its</b> foul odor. The Gemara explains with regard to which <i>halakhot</i> these characteristics of the bedbug were mentioned. The fact that <b>its length</b> is equal <b>to its width</b> was stated <b>with regard to the matter of stains,</b> i.e., if a stain is found whose length is the same as its width, one may attribute it to the blood of a bedbug even if the stain is larger than the area of a split bean.
The statement that <b>its taste is like its</b> foul <b>smell</b> is applicable <b>with regard to the matter of</b> the partaking of <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> the portion of the produce designated for the priest, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 8:2): <b>Or if he tasted the taste of a bedbug in his mouth,</b> which is prohibited for consumption, <b>this</b> person <b>must spit out</b> the contents of his mouth, despite the fact that it is generally prohibited to waste <i>teruma</i>. <b>How does he know</b> that there is a bedbug in his mouth? He knows because <b>its taste is like its</b> foul <b>smell. And still, how does he know</b> the smell of a bedbug? In answer to this question the <i>baraita</i> explains that one does not err with regard to the smell of the bedbug, as <b>a covenant is made with it that anyone who squeezes it</b> will <b>smell its</b> foul odor, and therefore it is a well-known smell.
The mishna teaches that a woman may attribute a blood stain as having come from another entity and remain pure. In this regard <b>Rav Ashi says:</b> In the case of <b>a town in which there are pigs, one</b> need <b>not be concerned for stains</b> found on the body or clothes of a woman living there. Since pigs wander the streets and often have stains of blood on them, and their living areas attract bugs of all kinds, any blood stain found on a woman can be attributed to the pigs. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: And this</b> town <b>of Dukeret,</b> where there are many slaughterhouses, garbage heaps, and bugs, <b>is</b> considered <b>like a town in which there are pigs.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>How large</b> a stain may a woman <b>attribute</b> to a louse? Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says: It can be up to the area of a split bean. The Gemara notes that the meaning of the statement of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus is a matter of dispute among the Sages. <b>Rav Huna says:</b> If the stain was the size <b>of a split bean she may not attribute</b> it to the blood of a louse; if it was <b>less than</b> the size <b>of a split bean she may attribute</b> it to the blood of a louse. <b>And Rav Ḥisda says:</b> Even if it was the size <b>of a split bean she may</b> still <b>attribute</b> it to the blood of a louse; but if the stain was <b>more than</b> the size <b>of a split bean she may not attribute</b> it to the blood of a louse.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that these Sages <b>disagree with regard to</b> the matter of: <b>Up to and including. As Rav Huna maintains</b> that the term: Up to, means: <b>Up to</b> the measure <b>but not including</b> the measure, and since Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus said that a stain can be up to the area of a split bean, this does not include the size of a bean itself. <b>And Rav Ḥisda maintains</b> that the term means: <b>Up to and including</b> the measure.
The Gemara responds: <b>Rav Huna</b> could <b>say to you</b> that <b>there are</b> instances where the term means <b>up to and including</b> the measure, <b>and there are</b> instances where it means <b>up to and not including</b> the measure. <b>And</b> both <b>here,</b> where it means up to and not including the measure, it is intended <b>as a stringency,</b> as in the statement of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus; <b>and there,</b> where it means up to and including the measure, it is likewise intended <b>as a stringency.</b>
<b>And Rav Ḥisda</b> could <b>say to you</b> that <b>in general I will say to you</b> that when it leads <b>to a stringency, we say</b> that the term: Up to, means up to and including the measure, whereas if it leads <b>to a leniency we do not say</b> so. <b>And here,</b> with regard to stains, I interpret the term in this manner despite the fact that it entails a leniency, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Abbahu. As Rabbi Abbahu says: All measures of the Sages</b> must be interpreted <b>stringently, except for</b> the measure <b>of a split bean</b> as a standard <b>for stains</b> of blood found on a woman’s clothing, which is interpreted <b>leniently.</b> Therefore, even if the stain is exactly the size of a bean the woman remains pure.
<b>Some say this <i>halakha</i> as a distinct</b> matter, not specifically as an explanation of the mishna: <b>Rav Huna says</b> the area <b>of a split bean</b> is considered the same <b>as</b> the area of <b>greater than a split bean. And Rav Ḥisda says</b> the area <b>of a split bean</b> is considered the same <b>as</b> the area of <b>less than a split bean. And</b> these two <i>amora’im</i> <b>disagree with regard to</b> the matter of <b>up to,</b> whether it means including or not including the measure itself, as discussed <b>in</b> this case <b>here,</b> with regard to stains. The Gemara <b>raises an objection:</b>

Daf 59a

If <b>there were on</b> a woman’s body <b>small drops of blood and large drops of blood, she may attribute</b> these drops to an external source, even <b>with regard to the largest</b> drop, provided that it is <b>up to</b> the size <b>of a split bean. What, is it not</b> that a drop the size <b>of a split bean</b> itself is considered <b>small,</b> like a drop that is less than the size of a bean, which contradicts the opinion of Rav Huna? The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it means that a drop exactly the size <b>of a split bean</b> is like <b>a large</b> drop, i.e., a drop greater than a bean.
It <b>was stated:</b> If a stain <b>was found on</b> a woman and it was the size <b>of a split bean and</b> slightly <b>more,</b> which is too large to be attributed to a louse, <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> area that was slightly <b>more</b> than a bean there was <b>a squashed louse,</b> what is the status of that woman? <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says she is ritually impure,</b> as the stain is not attributed to a louse; <b>Rabbi Yannai says she is pure.</b> The Gemara explains their opinions: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says she is impure,</b> in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> <b>that</b> a woman <b>may attribute</b> a stain to a louse only <b>with regard to</b> a stain whose area is up to the area <b>of a split bean,</b> whereas <b>with regard to</b> a stain the size <b>of a split bean and</b> slightly <b>more, she may not attribute</b> it to a louse.
By contrast, <b>Rabbi Yannai says she is pure,</b> as he maintains that <b>this statement</b> that one may not attribute a stain larger than a bean to a louse applies only <b>where</b> there is <b>no louse squashed</b> on the stain. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where</b> there is <b>a louse squashed</b> on the stain <b>it is apparent that this</b> blood that causes the stain to be slightly <b>more</b> than the size of a bean <b>is the blood of a louse.</b> Since it is visibly squashed there, there is no uncertainty in this regard. When that area is subtracted one <b>is left</b> with a stain that is the size <b>of a split bean,</b> and one may say that <b>since in general</b> a woman <b>attributes</b> a stain the size of a bean to a louse, <b>here too, she may attribute</b> the stain to another, second louse.
With regard to the dispute between Rabbi Ḥanina and Rabbi Yannai, <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b> If a woman <b>was occupied with</b> an item the size <b>of a split bean,</b> e.g., the blood of a slaughtered bird, or eye salve, <b>and</b> then a stain <b>was found on her</b> the size <b>of a split bean and</b> slightly <b>more, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Yirmeya elaborates: <b>The dilemma can be raised according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> who maintained in the previous case that she is impure, <b>and</b> the <b>dilemma can be raised according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yannai,</b> who ruled that she is pure.
<b>The dilemma can be raised according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> as perhaps <b>Rabbi Ḥanina states there</b> that <b>she is impure only where she was not occupied</b> with a louse, and there is no reason to attribute the stain to that cause. <b>But here, where she was occupied</b> with an item that can stain her, it can be claimed that <b>she may attribute</b> the stain to that source. <b>Or perhaps, even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yannai, who said</b> in the previous case that <b>she is pure, that statement</b> applies only <b>where a louse</b> was found <b>squashed on</b> the stain; <b>but</b> in a case <b>where there is no louse squashed on</b> the stain and there is no certainty that part of the stain came from another source, <b>she may not attribute</b> part of the stain to the item she was occupied with and part of the stain to a louse. In this situation everyone agrees she is impure.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman <b>was occupied with a red</b> item <b>she may not attribute a black</b> stain <b>to it.</b> Likewise, if she was dealing <b>with a small</b> item <b>she may not attribute a large</b> stain <b>to it. What are the circumstances</b> of the second clause of this <i>baraita</i>? Is it <b>not</b> referring to <b>a case like this</b> dilemma raised by Rabbi Yirmeya where she was occupied with an item the size of a bean and a stain was found on her that was the size of a bean and slightly more? If so, the <i>baraita</i> teaches that in such a situation she may not attribute the stain to the item.
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where she was occupied with</b> an item the size <b>of a split bean, and</b> subsequently a stain <b>was found on her</b> the size of <b>two split beans and</b> slightly <b>more.</b> In this situation she may not attribute the stain to the item she was occupied with. The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this case? Even if as much of the stain as possible is attributed to the item, a stain larger than a bean remains, and that part cannot be attributed to that source.
The Gemara answers that the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that one should <b>take</b> the blood stain the size <b>of a split bean</b> that came from the blood of <b>the bird</b> she was previously occupied with and <b>cast</b> it <b>into the middle</b> of the stain. In other words, assume the blood from the bird is in the middle of the large stain, joining together two smaller stains. Consequently, one could say: <b>Go here</b> and measure the stain on this side, and <b>there is no measure</b> that transmits impurity, as it is less than the size of a bean, and likewise, <b>go there,</b> to the other side, and <b>there is no measure</b> that transmits impurity. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so, and in such a case she is impure.
<b>Rava says:</b> If <b>one type</b> of a stain <b>was found on</b> a woman, e.g., a stain from the sap of a sycamore tree or an eye salve, <b>she may attribute</b> other stains <b>to</b> that source, even if the stains are of <b>several types,</b> i.e., if they differ in color from the first stain. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rava from the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>: If a woman <b>was occupied with a red</b> item <b>she may not attribute a black</b> stain <b>to it.</b> The Gemara answers: A situation where she <b>was occupied is different</b> from Rava’s case. Since she was occupied with a red item, there is no reason to attribute a black stain to that source. In Rava’s case, by contrast, she was not occupied with any item, and therefore one can say that just as a stain of one type was sprayed upon her without her knowledge, the same occurred with regard to the other types of stains.
<b>Some say</b> a different version of the above discussion. <b>Rava says:</b> If a woman <b>was occupied with</b> an item <b>of one type, she may attribute</b> stains of <b>several types to it.</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rava: If a woman <b>was occupied with a red</b> item <b>she may not attribute a black</b> stain <b>to it.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>When Rava said</b> his ruling he was referring to a situation <b>where she was occupied with</b> a slaughtered <b>chicken, which has several types of blood,</b> and therefore she may attribute stains of different types to that cause.
§ The mishna teaches that there was <b>an incident involving</b> one <b>woman</b> who came before Rabbi Akiva and he deemed her pure, to the surprise of his students. He explained to them that the Sages did not state the matter of the impurity of blood stains in order to be stringent; rather, they instituted this impurity in order to be lenient. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>the Sages did not state the matter</b> of the impurity of blood stains <b>to be lenient, but</b> rather <b>to be stringent?</b>
<b>Ravina says</b> that there is no contradiction between these two statements: The very institution of the impurity of blood stains was enacted so as <b>not to be</b> more <b>lenient than Torah law,</b> but <b>rather to be stringent beyond Torah law. But</b> since the impurity of blood <b>stains themselves is by rabbinic law,</b> the Sages were lenient in specific cases.
§ The mishna teaches with regard to <b>an examination cloth that was placed</b> beneath the pillow and blood was later found on the cloth, that Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, maintains that if the stain is round it is ritually pure and if it is elongated it is ritually impure. Concerning this <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Do the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, or not?</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>An elongated stain combines</b> with other elongated stains, so that if together they form the area of slightly more than a bean the woman is impure. But <b>a series of drops do not combine</b> to constitute a stain that renders her impure. <b>Whose</b> opinion is stated in this <i>baraita</i>? <b>If</b> it is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, why do I</b> need <b>a combination</b> in the case of an elongated stain? <b>Didn’t he say</b> that <b>an elongated</b> stain of <b>any</b> size renders her <b>impure?</b>
<b>Rather, is it not</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> and should one not <b>conclude from it</b> that the Rabbis <b>disagree</b> with Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok? The Gemara responds: <b>No, actually</b> the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, and when Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, said</b> an elongated stain is ritually impure he was referring to a stain found <b>on an examination cloth; but with regard to</b> a regular <b>stain</b> of an elongated shape, he does <b>not</b> hold it is impure regardless of its size.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok.</b> Since Shmuel rules that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with his opinion, it may be derived <b>by inference that</b> the Rabbis <b>disagree</b> with his opinion, as otherwise there would be no need for a ruling of <i>halakha</i>. The Gemara affirms: Indeed, <b>conclude from it</b> that this is correct.

Daf 59b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>a woman who is urinating and saw blood</b> intermingled with the urine, <b>Rabbi Meir says: If</b> she urinated while <b>standing</b> she is <b>ritually impure,</b> as the blood could have originated in the uterus. <b>And if she is sitting,</b> she is <b>ritually pure,</b> as it is clear that the blood is from a wound. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Whether</b> she urinates in <b>this</b> manner, i.e., standing, <b>or whether</b> she urinates in <b>that</b> manner, i.e., sitting, she is <b>ritually pure.</b>
In the case of <b>a man and a woman who urinated into a basin [<i>hasefel</i>], and blood is found on the water</b> in the basin, <b>Rabbi Yosei deems her ritually pure.</b> Even when it is clear that it is the blood of a woman who urinated, and there is only one uncertainty, Rabbi Yosei deems her ritually pure. In this case, there is a compound uncertainty: Did the blood originate with the man or with the woman, and did the blood come from the uterus or from a wound? <b>And Rabbi Shimon deems her ritually impure,</b> because there is only one uncertainty, <b>as it is not</b> the typical <b>manner of the man to discharge blood</b> with his urine; <b>rather, the presumptive status of</b> the <b>blood</b> is that it was discharged <b>from the woman.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that in a case where a woman finds blood in her urine Rabbi Meir distinguishes between a case where she is standing and a case where she is sitting. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about a situation where she is <b>standing?</b> The difference is <b>that we say</b> that while she was urinating the <b>urine returned to the uterus and brought blood</b> from there, which renders her impure. But if so, when she is <b>sitting as well, let us say</b> that the <b>urine returns to the uterus and brings blood.</b> Why does Rabbi Meir deem her ritually pure in that case?
<b>Shmuel says,</b> in answer to this question: This mishna is referring specifically to a case <b>where</b> the urine <b>flows</b> in a steady stream, without the woman straining. In such a situation, when she is sitting and the urine flows in a steady stream, the stream of urine does not return to the uterus and bring blood. By contrast, if she is standing the urine does not flow in a steady stream, and she must strain to urinate. When she strains to urinate, the urine can bring blood from the uterus with it, whether she is standing or sitting. The Gemara objects: But in a case where she is sitting <b>as well,</b> when the urine <b>flows</b> in a steady stream, <b>perhaps after the urine has finished, blood will come</b> naturally from the uterus, and the flow of blood will mix with the urine?
<b>Rabbi Abba says:</b> This is no concern, as the mishna is referring to a case <b>where she is sitting on the edge of the basin and</b> urinates in a steady <b>flow into the basin, and</b> the <b>blood is found</b> only <b>inside the basin. As, if it is so that after</b> the stream of <b>urine finished</b> the blood <b>came</b> naturally from her uterus, the blood <b>should have been found on the edge of the basin.</b> Since the blood is found only inside the basin it is clear that it came with the urine, not separately.
<b>Shmuel said, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei. And similarly, Rabbi Abba ruled for</b> a Sage called <b>Kala,</b> who inquired into this matter, that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: In the case of <b>a man and a woman</b> who urinated into a basin, and blood is found on the water in the basin, Rabbi Yosei deems her ritually pure. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: In a case where <b>a man and a woman were standing</b> and they urinated into the same basin, and blood was found in the basin, <b>what</b> would <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who distinguishes between a woman who was sitting and a woman who was standing, <b>say</b> the <i>halakha</i> is?
The Gemara clarifies the dilemma: <b>When Rabbi Meir said</b> that a woman who sees blood in her urine while standing is impure, does this apply <b>when</b> there is only <b>one uncertainty,</b> i.e., whether the blood came from a wound or from the uterus? <b>Whereas</b> in a case <b>of a compound uncertainty,</b> i.e., whether the blood came from the man or from the woman, and even if it came from the woman, whether it came from a wound or from her uterus, perhaps Rabbi Meir <b>does not deem</b> her <b>impure? Or perhaps there is no difference</b> between the two cases according to Rabbi Meir.
<b>Reish Lakish said:</b> Rabbi Meir would rule in <b>this</b> case of a compound uncertainty exactly as he rules in <b>that</b> case of a single uncertainty, i.e., there is no difference between the two cases. Reish Lakish clarifies: <b>From where</b> do I know that this is Rabbi Meir’s opinion? <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the latter clause of the mishna <b>does not teach: Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei deem her pure.</b> Instead, the mishna states merely that Rabbi Yosei deems her pure. This indicates that Rabbi Meir deems her impure even if a man and a woman both urinated into the same basin where the blood was found.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to Reish Lakish’s opinion: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if according to Rabbi Meir a woman is impure even when a man also urinates into the same basin, <b>now</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir deems her impure in</b> a case of <b>compound uncertainty, is it necessary</b> for the mishna to teach his opinion <b>in</b> a case of <b>one uncertainty?</b> The Gemara answers: The mishna formulated the <i>halakha</i> in that manner <b>to convey the far-reaching</b> nature of the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei,</b> i.e., <b>that he deems her pure even in</b> a case of <b>one uncertainty.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>rather than</b> stating the <b>dispute in</b> a case of <b>one uncertainty,</b> which serves <b>to convey the far-reaching</b> nature of the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> teach the <b>dispute in</b> a case of <b>compound uncertainty,</b> in order <b>to convey the far-reaching</b> nature of the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir.</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>preferable for the</b> <i>tanna</i> to teach <b>the strength of a lenient</b> ruling. If a <i>tanna</i> can formulate a dispute in a manner that emphasizes the extent of the more lenient opinion, he will do so.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> disagreed with Reish Lakish, and <b>said: When Rabbi Meir says</b> that the woman is impure, that applies only to a case <b>of one uncertainty, but</b> in a case <b>of compound uncertainty</b> Rabbi Meir <b>did not say</b> that she is impure. The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if Rabbi Meir deems her pure when both a man and a woman urinate into the same basin, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach: Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei deem her pure.</b> Why does the <i>tanna</i> mention only Rabbi Yosei? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so,</b> that Rabbi Meir agrees with this ruling, <b>but since</b> the mishna <b>left off</b> with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei</b> at the end of the first clause of the mishna, the <i>tanna</i> <b>opened</b> the latter clause <b>with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei</b> as well.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> as <b>Rabbi Yosei deems</b> her <b>pure</b> in a case <b>of one uncertainty, is it necessary</b> for the mishna to teach his opinion a case <b>of a compound uncertainty?</b> The Gemara answers: It is necessary for the <i>tanna</i> to state that Rabbi Yosei deems her pure in a case of compound uncertainty, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>this statement,</b> that Rabbi Yosei deems her pure, applies only <b>after the fact,</b> if the woman has already touched pure items, <b>but</b> he does <b>not</b> deem her pure <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that Rabbi Yosei deems her pure even <i>ab initio</i>.
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> In the case of <b>a man and a woman who urinated into a basin, and blood is found on the water</b> in the basin, <b>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei deem her ritually pure, and Rabbi Shimon deems her ritually impure,</b> as there is only one uncertainty.
§ The mishna teaches that Rabbi Shimon deems her ritually impure because there is only one uncertainty, as it is not the typical manner of the man to discharge blood with his urine. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: In a case where <b>a woman</b> was <b>sitting</b> and she urinated into a basin, and blood was found in the basin, <b>what</b> would <b>Rabbi Shimon say?</b> The Gemara explains the dilemma: <b>When Rabbi Shimon stated</b> his opinion, was he referring specifically <b>to</b> a woman who <b>is standing, who in general must strain</b> to urinate in such a position, and perhaps as a result the blood came from the uterus? <b>Whereas</b> if <b>she</b> is <b>sitting</b> without straining, in which case Rabbi Meir deems her pure, perhaps Rabbi Shimon agrees that she is <b>not</b> impure. <b>Or perhaps there is no difference</b> between the two cases according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon.
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman urinates while <b>sitting</b> and blood is found in the basin, she can <b>attribute</b> the blood to a wound and she is pure, but if she is <b>standing she cannot attribute</b> the blood to a wound, and therefore she is impure; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei said: Both</b> in <b>this</b> case <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case <b>she</b> can <b>attribute</b> the blood to a wound and she is pure. <b>Rabbi Shimon said: Both</b> in <b>this</b> case <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case <b>she cannot attribute</b> the blood to a wound, and she is impure.
Another <b>dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon: In a case where <b>a man and a woman</b> were <b>sitting</b> and urinated into the same basin, and blood was found in the basin, <b>what</b> would <b>Rabbi Shimon say?</b> The Gemara clarifies the dilemma: <b>When Rabbi Shimon stated</b> his opinion, was he referring to a woman who <b>is standing, who in general must strain</b> to urinate in such a position and perhaps as a result the blood came from the uterus, <b>or</b> to a case where <b>she</b> alone <b>is sitting, which</b> are cases of only <b>one uncertainty? Whereas</b> in a case of <b>compound uncertainty,</b> i.e., uncertainty whether the blood came from the man or from the woman, and even if it did come from the woman, whether it was from a wound or from her uterus, perhaps <b>he does not say</b> that she is impure. <b>Or perhaps there is no difference</b> between the cases, as it is entirely atypical for a man to discharge blood.
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the mishna: <b>Since Rabbi Shimon said</b> that <b>the presumptive status of</b> the <b>blood</b> is that it was discharged <b>from the woman,</b> evidently there <b>is no difference</b> in his opinion whether she was <b>standing or</b> whether she was <b>sitting.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case where a woman <b>lent her garment to a gentile woman or to a menstruating</b> Jewish <b>woman,</b> and after the borrower returned the garment the owner wore it and then discovered a blood stain, she <b>attributes</b> the blood stain <b>to</b> the gentile or the menstruating woman.
In a case of <b>three women who wore one garment or who sat on one bench [<i>safsal</i>],</b> one after the other, and the garment, or bench, was examined before the first of them donned it, or sat on it, and it was clean, and after the third one removed the garment, or stood up, <b>a blood</b> stain <b>was discovered on</b> the garment or on the bench, <b>all</b> the women <b>are ritually impure.</b>
If <b>they sat on a stone bench or on the bench [<i>ha’itzteva</i>] of a bathhouse,</b> neither of which can become ritually impure, the first because it is stone and the second because it is attached to the floor of the bathhouse, and a blood stain was found on one of those benches, <b>Rabbi Neḥemya deems</b> all three women <b>ritually pure, as Rabbi Neḥemya would say: Any item that is not susceptible to ritual impurity is not susceptible to</b> ritual impurity due to blood <b>stains.</b> The decree of impurity due to blood stains was limited to items susceptible to ritual impurity.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav says:</b> The ruling of the mishna is stated <b>with regard to a gentile woman</b>

Daf 60a

<b>who is</b> of age and already <b>seeing</b> a flow of menstrual blood, i.e., she has had a flow of menstrual blood.
The Gemara explains: <b>From where</b> does Rav know that this is referring to a gentile woman who once experienced a flow of blood? He infers from the mishna that the gentile woman it mentions is <b>similar to a menstruating woman: Just as a menstruating woman</b> is one <b>who sees,</b> i.e., who has already experienced bleeding, <b>so too,</b> the mishna is referring to an adult <b>gentile woman who</b> already <b>sees</b> menstrual blood.
<b>Rav Sheshet says: I say</b> that <b>when Rav was dozing or sleeping he said that <i>halakha</i>,</b> i.e., it is an error. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman loaned her garment to a gentile and subsequently found a blood stain on it, <b>she attributes</b> the stain <b>to the gentile woman.</b> This <i>tanna</i> deems it permitted for her to attribute the blood to any gentile woman, regardless of her age or her likelihood of bleeding. <b>Rabbi Meir</b> disagrees and <b>says:</b> This applies specifically <b>to a gentile woman who is fit to see</b> menstrual blood. <b>And</b> the Gemara adds that <b>even Rabbi Meir says only that</b> the gentile woman must be <b>fit to see</b> menstrual blood, <b>but</b> he too agrees that <b>it is not necessary</b> for her to be <b>seeing</b> blood at that time. She does not have to have actually experienced bleeding at some point.
<b>Rava said</b> in response to Rav Sheshet’s challenge: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir</b> is coming <b>to be stringent?</b> Rav Sheshet maintains that according to the first <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> she can attribute the blood stain to any gentile, whereas Rabbi Meir rules stringently that she may attribute it only to a gentile who is fit to experience bleeding. This is incorrect, as <b>Rabbi Meir</b> is actually coming <b>to be lenient.</b> In other words, the first <i>tanna</i> is more stringent, as he deems it permitted for her to attribute the blood stain only to a gentile woman who had experienced a menstrual flow at least once. By contrast, Rabbi Meir rules that she may attribute the stain to a gentile woman who is old enough to experience bleeding, even if she has never experienced a menstrual flow.
The Gemara provides the reason for Rava’s opinion. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A woman who loaned her garment to a gentile woman and subsequently finds a blood stain on it <b>may not attribute</b> the stain <b>to</b> the <b>gentile woman. Rabbi Meir says</b> that <b>she may attribute</b> the blood stain to the gentile woman. <b>But if so,</b> the first <i>baraita</i>, which states that according to the first <i>tanna</i> she may attribute the blood stain to any gentile woman, is <b>difficult.</b> You must <b>answer like this:</b> According to the first <i>tanna</i> she may attribute the blood to any gentile woman provided that <b>she sees,</b> i.e., that she once experienced bleeding. By contrast, <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> a more lenient opinion, <b>that</b> she may attribute it to the gentile woman provided that <b>she is fit to see</b> menstrual blood, <b>and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though she has not</b> actually <b>seen</b> menstrual blood yet.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a woman who loaned her garment to another woman who was a lesser <i>zava</i>: The lender <b>may attribute</b> the blood stain on the loaned garment <b>to a woman who observes</b> a clean <b>day for</b> each <b>day</b> she experiences a discharge, if the blood is found <b>on her second</b> day, i.e., the day after she had a discharge, despite the fact that she does not have a presumptive status of seeing blood. It is nevertheless considered that her uterus is open and the likelihood is that she will experience bleeding.
<b>And</b> likewise, she may also attribute the blood stain if she loaned her garment <b>to a woman counting seven</b> clean days <b>who did not immerse</b> in a ritual bath, and who will now have to count another seven clean days. <b>Therefore,</b> the status of the one who loaned the garment <b>is fixed, and</b> the status of <b>the other</b> woman <b>is ruined</b> and she must begin her counting again; this is <b>the statement of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: She may not attribute</b> the blood flow to either of these women. <b>Therefore,</b> the statuses of <b>both</b> the woman who loaned the garment and the one who borrowed it <b>are ruined,</b> in that both women are deemed impure.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> both Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>agree that</b> a woman who lends her garment <b>may attribute</b> any blood stain found on it <b>to a woman</b> who <b>observes a day for a day</b> if it is <b>on her first</b> day of the discharge. In this case the status of the woman who borrowed the garment is no more ruined than it was already, as either way she can become pure on the following day.
<b>And</b> they also agree <b>in</b> a case where the woman who borrowed the garment was a woman after childbirth <b>who is observing</b> the period <b>of</b> the <b>blood of purity.</b> During these days, attributing the blood to her does not ruin her status, as any blood she emits is pure and does not affect her status. <b>And</b> similarly, the lender may attribute the blood stain <b>to a virgin</b> who engages in intercourse for the first time, <b>as her blood is pure,</b> as there is an assumption that it is hymenal bleeding rather than menstrual blood.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the clause starting with: <b>Therefore,</b> mentioned <b>by Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel?</b> It is obvious that the status of only one woman is ruined, so what information does this observation add? The Gemara answers that this clause does not add any new information; rather, the <i>baraita</i> taught it <b>because</b> of the use of the similar clause beginning with: Therefore, stated <b>by Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi in the latter part of the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara persists: But <b>why do I</b> need the clause starting with: <b>Therefore,</b> in the statement <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? That too is apparently superfluous. The Gemara explains: It is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that the status of the woman <b>who has</b> the blood <b>stain found with her</b> when she is wearing the garment, should be <b>ruined,</b> whereas the status of <b>the other</b> woman should <b>not be ruined,</b> as the garment was not with her when the blood stain was discovered. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> the clause beginning with: Therefore, to stress that both women are impure.
§ With regard to the dispute between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> In a case of two individuals, one of whom was <b>ritually impure and</b> the other of whom was <b>pure, who walked on two paths, one</b> of which was <b>pure and</b> the other <b>one impure</b> due to a corpse buried there, and neither remembers which path he took, and afterward they handled items of ritual purity, e.g., the portion of produce designated for the priest [<i>teruma</i>] or consecrated items, <b>we have arrived at the dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b> According to Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, if one of the two individuals was already impure it can be assumed that he was the one who walked along the ritually impure path, and the other individual remains pure. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi claims that there is no assumption that the one who was pure retains that state, as it is equally possible that he walked along the ritually impure path.
<b>Rav Adda objects to this</b> suggestion of Rav Ḥisda, claiming that one cannot compare the two cases. It is possible that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>states</b> his <i>halakha</i> <b>only there,</b> with regard to a woman who observes a day for a day, as she can immerse in a ritual bath at any time, and <b>therefore both</b> women <b>are like each other,</b> i.e., both have a presumption of ritual purity. But <b>here,</b> in the case of the two individuals walking on two paths, <b>what</b> practical <b>difference</b> does it make to the one who was previously impure if he remains ritually impure? Since there is no change of status, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi would agree in that case that it can be assumed that the individual who was previously impure was the one who walked on the impure path.
<b>And</b> the Gemara asks: How would <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> respond to this claim? Rav Ḥisda would answer that a woman who observes a day for a day is also not fully pure, as <b>ultimately she requires immersion</b> in a ritual bath to complete her purification, and yet Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi still rejects the attribution of the blood flow to her. Accordingly, the two cases are comparable and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi would not assume that the individual who was already impure was the one who walked along the path that was impure.
<b>It was stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> In a case of two individuals, one of whom was <b>ritually impure and</b> the other of whom was <b>pure, or even</b> where one was <b>pure and</b> the other was impure due to <b>uncertainty, who walked on two</b> different <b>paths, one</b> of which was <b>impure and</b> the other <b>one pure,</b> and neither remembers which path he took, one may <b>attribute</b> by assuming that <b>the impure</b> path was the one traversed <b>by</b> the individual who was impure due to <b>uncertainty, and</b> the <b>pure</b> path was traversed <b>by</b> the one who was <b>ritually pure.</b> And <b>everyone agrees</b> with this ruling, i.e., Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi agrees with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel in this case. This statement is in accordance with Rav Adda’s objection, not in accordance with the suggestion of Rav Ḥisda.
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised a dilemma before Rabbi Yehuda bar Livai: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to attributing</b> a blood <b>stain to</b> a woman who is already impure due to having seen a blood <b>stain?</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan clarifies his question: <b>I am not raising</b> this <b>dilemma to you according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
Rabbi Yoḥanan explains why his dilemma does not apply according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>Now, and if there,</b> where one loaned her garment to a woman who observes a clean day for a day, which is a case <b>where she sees</b> a discharge <b>from her body,</b> and yet <b>you said</b> that according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi the other woman <b>may not attribute</b> the blood stain to her, then <b>here,</b> in the case of a woman who is impure merely due to having seen a blood stain, <b>where</b> her impurity <b>came from</b> a source <b>external</b> to her, is it <b>not all the more so</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi would not permit one to attribute the blood stain to her?
Rather, <b>when I raise</b> this <b>dilemma to you,</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan clarifies the dilemma: Perhaps <b>it is</b> only <b>there,</b> in the case where she loaned her garment to a woman who observes a day for a day, <b>where she sees</b> the discharge <b>from her body,</b> that the lender <b>may attribute</b> the blood stain to her, whereas <b>here, where</b> it is possible that the stain <b>came from</b> a source <b>external</b> to her, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel would <b>not</b> permit the lender to <b>attribute</b> this new blood stain to her. <b>Or perhaps it is no different,</b> and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel would rule leniently in both cases.
Rabbi Yehuda bar Livai <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: She <b>may not attribute</b> this blood stain to a woman who was already impure due to having seen a blood stain, and both women are ritually impure. Rabbi Yoḥanan asked Rabbi Yehuda bar Livai: <b>What is the reason</b> that she may not attribute the blood stain to her? Rabbi Yehuda bar Livai answered: It is <b>because</b> in this case one <b>may not attribute</b> the new blood stain to that other woman, as her previous stain might have come from an external cause.
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raised an objection to</b> Rabbi Yehuda bar Livai from the following <i>baraita</i>: A woman who loans her garment to another and subsequently finds a blood stain on it <b>may not attribute</b> the blood <b>stain to</b> a woman who was impure due to having previously seen a blood <b>stain.</b> But if <b>she loaned her garment to a gentile woman or to</b> a woman who was <b>observing</b> days of impurity <b>due to</b> having seen a blood <b>stain, she may attribute</b> the blood stain found on the garment to that other woman.
Before explaining the objection, the Gemara first analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>itself</b> is <b>difficult.</b> In <b>the first clause you said</b> that a woman who loans her garment to another and subsequently finds a blood stain on it <b>may not attribute</b> the blood stain to a woman who was impure due to having previously seen a blood stain, whereas in <b>the latter clause you said</b> that she <b>may attribute</b> the blood stain to such a woman. Rabbi Yoḥanan explains this contradiction: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult. This</b> first clause of the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and that</b> latter clause is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b>
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> an alternative resolution of the contradiction: Both <b>this</b> clause <b>and that</b> clause are in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. The difference is that <b>this</b> latter clause, where she may attribute the blood stain to the other woman, is referring to a case where the blood stain was found <b>on</b> that woman’s <b>first</b> day, when she had just found the blood stain and is impure for that day. Since she is in any case impure for that day, she is not adversely affected by having the new stain attributed to her. The case where the blood stain may not be attributed to the other woman is a case where the blood stain in question was found <b>on her second</b> day, i.e., the day after she found the blood stain, when she is not impure but merely requires immersion. The lender may not attribute the new blood stain to her, as that would render her ritually impure for an extra day.
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> yet another resolution of the <i>baraita</i>: Both <b>this</b> first clause <b>and that</b> latter clause are in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, and it</b> is <b>not difficult.</b>

Daf 60b

<b>Here,</b> in the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i>, when she may attribute the stain to a woman who had seen a blood stain, it is referring to rendering that woman impure <b>retroactively</b> with regard to the status of pure items that she had already touched before the stain was found on the garment she borrowed. This attribution of the blood stain to the woman who was already impure due to seeing a blood stain does not harm her impure status in any way, as items she had previously touched were already considered impure. <b>There,</b> in the beginning of the <i>baraita</i>, where the ruling is that the lender may not attribute the blood stain to a woman who was already impure, it is referring to her own status <b>with regard to the future.</b> With regard to the future, one may not attribute the stain to woman who had already seen a blood stain, as this attribution would ruin that woman’s counting of pure days.
The Gemara returns to the objection: The <i>baraita</i> has been resolved, but <b>in any case</b> everyone agrees that according to Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel she may attribute the stain to a woman who had previously seen a blood stain. This presents <b>a difficulty</b> to the answer of Rabbi Yehuda bar Livai, i.e., that according to Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel one may not attribute the blood stain in such a case. <b>Ravina said:</b> It is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying</b> in its latter clause: If <b>she loaned her garment to a gentile woman,</b> then with regard to defining the lender as one <b>who had seen</b> a blood <b>stain,</b> the lender <b>may attribute</b> the stain <b>to</b> the gentile woman. If so, it cannot be inferred from the <i>baraita</i> that according to Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel one may attribute a blood stain to another woman who was already impure due to a blood stain.
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: Or to</b> a woman who was <b>observing</b> days of impurity <b>due to</b> having seen a blood <b>stain,</b> i.e., it mentions another woman who was already impure due to having seen a blood stain. Ravina explains that <b>this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying:</b> If she loaned the garment to a gentile woman <b>or to</b> a woman after childbirth <b>who is observing</b> the period <b>of</b> the <b>blood of purity,</b> then with regard to defining the lender as <b>a woman who saw</b> a blood <b>stain, she may attribute</b> the stain to the gentile or to the woman observing the days of ritually pure blood, and the lender remains pure.
§ The mishna teaches: In a case of <b>three</b> women <b>who wore</b> one garment, etc. If they sat on a stone bench or on the bench of a bathhouse, Rabbi Neḥemya deems all three women ritually pure, <b>as Rabbi Neḥemya would</b> say: Any item that is not susceptible to ritual impurity is not susceptible to ritual impurity due to blood stains. The Gemara clarifies the opinion of Rabbi Neḥemya. <b>Rav Mattana says: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Neḥemya? As it is written:</b> “And her gates shall lament and mourn; <b>and clean she shall sit upon the ground”</b> (Isaiah 3:26). This teaches that <b>once she sits on the ground,</b> which is not susceptible to ritual impurity, <b>she shall be clean,</b> i.e., pure.
<b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: Rabbi Neḥemya would deem her ritually pure even</b> if she sat <b>on the exterior</b> of an inverted <b>earthenware vessel.</b> Since an earthenware vessel becomes impure only if an impure item enters its airspace, its exterior is not susceptible to ritual impurity and therefore it does not render a woman who sees a blood stain on it ritually impure. The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> Rabbi Neḥemya himself said that she does not become impure if a blood stain is found on an item that is not susceptible to ritual impurity. What does Rabbi Ḥanina add to that statement?
The Gemara answers: This observation is necessary, <b>lest you say: Let</b> the Sages <b>decree</b> that she becomes impure from a blood stain found on <b>the exterior</b> of an earthenware vessel, <b>due to</b> its similarity to a blood stain found on <b>the interior,</b> which would render her impure. Therefore, Rabbi Ḥanina <b>teaches us</b> that there is no such decree.
<b>Abaye says: Rabbi Neḥemya would deem her ritually pure</b> if she saw blood stains <b>on small rags that do not have</b> an area of <b>three</b> fingerbreadths <b>by three</b> fingerbreadths, <b>as</b> these rags <b>are suitable</b> for use <b>neither for the poor nor for the wealthy.</b>
<b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Rav Mattana taught in the name of Rav:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya. Rav Naḥman said</b> to Rav Ḥiyya bar Rav Mattana: <b>Father teaches</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>An incident</b> of this kind <b>came before the Sages,</b> involving two women who found a blood stain on an item that was not susceptible to ritual impurity, <b>and</b> the Sages <b>deemed</b> both women <b>ritually impure,</b> in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, who disagree with Rabbi Neḥemya. <b>And</b> yet <b>you say</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya?</b>
The Gemara inquires: <b>What is</b> that incident in question? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>two women who were grinding with a hand mill</b> and were standing next to each other, <b>and blood was found beneath the</b> woman on the <b>inside,</b> i.e., the woman standing closest to the mill, <b>they are both ritually impure.</b> The reason is that the woman standing further away pushes in to get closer to the mill, and therefore the blood stain could be from either of them. But if blood was found <b>beneath</b> the woman on <b>the outside,</b> i.e., the woman standing further from the mill, the woman on <b>the outside is impure and</b> the woman on <b>the inside is pure.</b> If the blood was found <b>between them, they are both impure.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>There was an incident and blood was found on the edge of a bathtub, and</b> in another case a blood stain was found <b>on an olive leaf at the time that</b> the women <b>were kindling the oven. And the incident came before the Sages and</b> they <b>deemed</b> both women <b>ritually impure.</b> Since an olive leaf is not susceptible to ritual impurity, this <i>baraita</i> is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Neḥemya.
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Rav Mattana answered: <b>It is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> whether or not the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Neḥemya. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a blood stain is found on an item that is not susceptible to ritual impurity, <b>Rabbi Ya’akov deems her impure, but Rabbi Neḥemya deems her pure. And the Sages ruled</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case of <b>three women who were sleeping in one bed and blood was discovered beneath one of them, all of them are ritually impure.</b> If when the blood was discovered <b>one of them examined</b> herself <b>and discovered that she was impure</b> due to menstruation, <b>she is impure and the</b> other <b>two are pure. And</b> if none of them examined themselves, or if all of them examined themselves and were pure, <b>they attribute</b> the blood <b>to each other,</b> i.e., if one of them is unfit to menstruate, e.g., she is pregnant, she may attribute the blood to the other women who are fit to menstruate. <b>And if</b> all three women <b>were not fit to see</b> the flow of blood, e.g., they each belonged to one of the categories listed in the mishna on 7a, <b>one considers them as though they were fit,</b> and all three are impure, because the blood must have originated from one of them.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if one of the women examined herself when the blood was discovered and found that she was impure due to menstruation, she is impure and the other two are pure. In this regard, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The other two women may attribute the blood to the one who examined herself only <b>when she examined herself within</b> the brief <b>period of time</b> needed for the onset of <b>menstruation.</b> But if she checked herself after this time, although she is impure, the other women are also impure, due to uncertainty.
The Gemara explains: Rav <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>bar Padda, who said:</b> There are three time periods with regard to defining a woman’s ritual-purity status if she sees blood after engaging in intercourse. The shortest is the period of time required for the onset of menstruation, i.e., for menstrual bleeding to begin. The next shortest is the time it would take the woman to get out of bed after intercourse and wash her private parts. The longest period is any time longer than that. If a woman finds blood after intercourse within the period of time needed for the onset of menstruation, she must have been impure during intercourse. With regard to <b>any</b> woman <b>whose husband</b> would be liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a sin offering</b> if he had engaged in intercourse with her, because she found the blood within that short period, if she had not been engaging in intercourse, but rather had been preparing food in a state of ritual purity, and then she found blood within that short period, all the <b>pure items</b> that she touched <b>are ritually impure.</b>
By contrast, with regard to any woman <b>whose husband</b> would be liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a provisional guilt offering</b> if he had engaged in intercourse with her, as it is uncertain whether he violated a transgression for which he would be liable to bring a sin offering, if she had not been engaging in intercourse, but rather had been preparing food in a state of ritual purity and then found blood within that same time period, the status of all the <b>pure items</b> she touched is <b>suspended,</b> as their status is uncertain. They are not burned but they may not be eaten either. Finally, with regard to any woman <b>whose husband</b> would be <b>exempt</b> from bringing any offering, i.e., where she finds blood after a longer time period, if she had not been engaging in intercourse, but rather had been preparing food in a state of ritual purity, and then found the blood after a longer time period, all the <b>pure items</b> she touched remain <b>pure.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Oshaya says:</b> There is no connection between her husband’s obligation to bring an offering and the ritual-purity status of the items she handled. <b>Even</b> if <b>her husband</b> is liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a sin offering,</b> i.e., when she discovered the blood within the period of time needed for the onset of menstruation, the status of all the <b>pure items</b> she touched before she discovered the blood is <b>suspended,</b> as their status is uncertain.
Rabbi Oshaya explains his reasoning. <b>Granted, there,</b> in the case of intercourse, where the husband must bring an offering, one can <b>say</b> that the male <b>organ prevented the blood</b> from emerging from her body, and therefore it is clear that she was impure beforehand. <b>But here,</b> in the case of preparing food in a state of ritual purity, <b>if it is so that there was blood</b> coming out of her while she was preparing the food, <b>what prevented</b> the blood from emerging from her body?
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya says a parable</b> in explanation <b>of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Oshaya: To what is this matter comparable? To a child and an old man who are walking along the road. As long as they are on the road,</b> the <b>child delays his arrival,</b> i.e., he walks at the pace of the old man. But once <b>they enter the city,</b> the <b>child hastens his arrival,</b> and runs on ahead. Similarly, as soon as the couple has finished engaging in intercourse, the blood comes quickly, but the blood is hindered from coming out during intercourse. <b>And Abaye</b> also <b>says a parable</b> in explanation <b>of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Oshaya: To what is this matter comparable? To a man who puts</b> his <b>finger in</b> his <b>eye. As long as</b> his <b>finger is in</b> his <b>eye,</b> the <b>tears delay their arrival</b> and remain in the eye. But as soon as <b>he</b> has <b>removed his finger</b> the <b>tears hasten their arrival.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> with regard to three women who were sleeping in one bed and blood was discovered beneath one of them, that if one of them is unfit to menstruate <b>they attribute</b> the blood <b>to each other,</b> i.e., to the women who are fit to menstruate. In this regard, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How do they attribute</b> the blood to <b>one another?</b> If one of the women is <b>pregnant and</b> one <b>is not pregnant,</b> the <b>pregnant</b> woman <b>may attribute</b> the blood <b>to the</b> woman <b>who is not pregnant.</b>
If one of the women is <b>nursing</b> and the other <b>is not nursing, the nursing</b> woman <b>may attribute</b> the blood <b>to the</b> woman <b>who is not nursing.</b> If one of the women is <b>old</b> and no longer experiences bleeding regularly, <b>and</b> the other one <b>is not old,</b> the <b>old</b> woman <b>may attribute</b> the blood <b>to</b> the woman <b>who is not old.</b> Likewise, if one of the women is <b>a virgin,</b> in this context, one who has not yet experienced bleeding due to her youth, <b>and</b> the other woman <b>is not a virgin,</b> in this context, one who has experienced bleeding, the <b>virgin may attribute</b> the blood <b>to</b> the woman <b>who is not a virgin.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>If both</b> women <b>are pregnant,</b> or <b>both</b> women <b>are nursing,</b> or <b>both</b> women <b>are old,</b> or <b>both</b> women <b>are virgins,</b> in <b>this</b> case the <i>halakha</i> is <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna: If both women <b>were not fit to see</b> menstrual blood, and yet blood is found beneath them on the bed, <b>one considers</b> them

Daf 61a

<b>as though they were fit,</b> and all three are impure, because the blood must have originated from one of them.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case of <b>three women who were sleeping in one bed</b> that was located adjacent to a wall, <b>and blood was discovered beneath the middle</b> woman, <b>all of them are ritually impure.</b> If the blood was discovered <b>beneath</b> the woman on <b>the inside,</b> closest to the wall, <b>the two innermost</b> women <b>are ritually impure and</b> the woman on <b>the outside is ritually pure.</b> If the blood was discovered <b>beneath</b> the woman on <b>the outside,</b> farthest from the wall, <b>the two outermost</b> women <b>are ritually impure and</b> the woman on <b>the inside is ritually pure.</b>
<b>When</b> is that the ruling? It is <b>when they passed</b> into their positions on the bed <b>via the foot of the bed; but if they passed</b> into their positions on the bed <b>via</b> the side of the bed, <b>over</b> the place where the blood was discovered, <b>all of them are ritually impure.</b> If immediately after the blood was discovered, <b>one of them examined</b> herself <b>and she was found</b> to be <b>ritually pure, she is pure and</b> the other <b>two are impure.</b> If <b>two of them examined</b> themselves <b>and found</b> that they were <b>ritually pure, they are pure and</b> the <b>third is impure.</b> If all <b>three of them examined</b> themselves <b>and found</b> that they were <b>ritually pure, all of them are ritually impure,</b> as the blood must have originated from one of them.
<b>To what</b> case <b>is</b> this <b>matter comparable?</b> It is similar <b>to</b> the case of <b>a ritually impure pile</b> of stones with an olive-bulk of a corpse beneath it, <b>where</b> this pile <b>was intermingled with two ritually pure piles, and they examined one of them and found it pure. That</b> pile <b>is pure and</b> the other <b>two are impure.</b> If they examined <b>two</b> of them <b>and found</b> them <b>ritually pure, they are ritually pure and</b> the <b>third is impure.</b>
If they examined all <b>three of them and found</b> them <b>ritually pure, all of them are impure;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir, as Rabbi Meir would say:</b> With regard to <b>any item that has</b> the <b>presumptive status of ritual impurity, it forever</b> remains <b>in its</b> state of <b>ritual impurity,</b> even if one examined the relevant area or item and the source of impurity was not found, <b>until it becomes known to you where</b> the <b>ritual impurity is.</b> The assumption is that the impurity was not found because the examination was not conducted properly.
<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> One continues <b>searching</b> the relevant area <b>until he reaches bedrock or virgin soil,</b> beneath which there is certainly no ritual impurity. If no ritual impurity is found at that stage, presumably an animal dragged the olive-bulk of the corpse from beneath the pile, and the pile of rocks is pure.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The previous mishna taught that if blood is found beneath one of three women lying together on a bed, they are all ritually impure. By contrast, the mishna here distinguishes based on the precise location where the blood was found. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different in the first clause,</b> i.e., the previous mishna, <b>which did not distinguish</b> on the basis of where the blood was found, <b>and what is different in the latter clause,</b> i.e., this mishna, <b>which does distinguish</b> in that manner? <b>Rabbi Ami said</b> that the previous mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the women were lying <b>intertwined,</b> and therefore it is impossible to distinguish between the woman on the inside and the woman on the outside.
§ The mishna teaches: If immediately after the blood was discovered, <b>one of them examined</b> herself and she was found to be ritually pure, she is pure and the other two are impure. If two of them examined themselves and found that they were ritually pure, they are pure and the third is impure. If all three of them examined themselves and found that they were ritually pure, all of them are ritually impure. The mishna proceeds to compare this case to that of a pile of stones beneath which there is an olive-bulk of a corpse. The Gemara asks: <b>Why does</b> the <i>tanna</i> need <b>to teach: To what</b> case <b>is</b> this <b>matter comparable?</b> The ruling of the mishna is clear enough without this analogy.
The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what <b>Rabbi Meir is saying to the Rabbis: What is different with regard to</b> the case of <b>blood, where you do not disagree</b> with me, as you concede that all three women are impure, <b>and what is different with regard to</b> the case of <b>the pile</b> of stones, <b>where you disagree</b> with me and maintain that all three piles of stones can be ritually pure if they are examined?
<b>And the Rabbis</b> would counter that the two cases are different. <b>Granted, there,</b> with regard to the piles of stones, one could <b>say</b> that <b>a raven</b> or some other animal <b>took</b> away the olive-bulk of the corpse, so there is a reason to deem all the piles pure. <b>But here,</b> in the case of the three women and the blood, <b>from where did this blood come?</b> It must have come from one of them. Therefore, at least one of the women must be ritually impure, and one cannot say that all three are pure.
The Gemara discusses other cases involving possible mistakes in examinations. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Meir said</b> that there was <b>an incident involving a sycamore</b> tree <b>in Kefar Sava, with regard to which they had a presumption of ritual impurity,</b> i.e., a presumption that there was a corpse buried beneath it. <b>And they examined</b> by digging in that place <b>and did not find</b> any corpse. <b>Some days</b> later, <b>the wind blew at it and uprooted</b> the sycamore tree, <b>and they found a skull from a corpse stuck in its roots.</b> This apparently indicates that in general one cannot rely upon an examination. The Sages <b>said to</b> Rabbi Meir: Do you seek to bring <b>a proof from there?</b> One can <b>say</b> that <b>they did not examine as much as was necessary.</b>
The Gemara cites another case. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei said</b> that there was <b>an incident involving a cave in Shiḥin with regard to which they had a presumption of ritual impurity</b> of a corpse. <b>And they examined</b> by digging inside the cave <b>until they reached ground that was as smooth as a fingernail, and they did not find</b> any corpse. <b>Some days</b> later <b>workers entered</b> the cave <b>because</b> they sought shelter from <b>the rain. And they dug with their shovels and found a mortar full of bones.</b> Once again, this indicates that one cannot rely upon an examination. The Sages <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yosei: Do you bring <b>a proof from there?</b> One can <b>say they did not examine as much as was necessary.</b>
The Gemara cites yet another relevant case. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Abba Shaul says</b> that there was <b>an incident involving bedrock in Beit Ḥoron, with regard to which they had a presumption of ritual impurity</b> of a corpse. <b>And the Sages were unable to examine</b> it <b>because</b> the area of the bedrock <b>was too large. And there was one old man there, and his name was Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya. He said to them: Bring me sheets. They brought him sheets and he soaked them in water and spread them over</b> the bedrock. In every <b>place of ritual purity</b> the ground remained <b>dry,</b> and in every <b>place of ritual impurity</b> the ground became <b>moist.</b> They understood that it was not entirely bedrock, as the area where the ground was wet was actually soft earth. <b>And they examined</b> there by digging <b>and found a large pit filled with bones.</b>
It is <b>taught: That</b> pit that they found is <b>the pit that Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, filled with corpses, as it is written: “Now the pit where Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain by the side of Gedaliah</b> was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasa king of Israel; the same Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, filled with them that were slain” (Jeremiah 41:9).
The Gemara analyzes that verse: <b>And did Gedaliah kill them? But didn’t Ishmael kill them?</b> Gedaliah was one of those killed by Ishmael and his men (see Jeremiah 41:2). The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, since</b> Gedaliah <b>should have been concerned</b> and cautious based <b>on the advice of Johanan, son of Kareah,</b> who warned him that Ishmael was conspiring to kill him and even offered to go and kill Ishmael in a preemptive strike (see Jeremiah 40:13–16), <b>but</b> Gedaliah <b>was not concerned</b> and he refused to listen to Johanan’s advice, saying that he did not want to listen to malicious speech, <b>the verse ascribes him</b> blame <b>as though he</b> himself <b>killed them.</b>
§ In relation to the above comment that Gedaliah was killed after not heeding the warning of Johanan, the Gemara clarifies what is permitted when receiving such a warning. <b>Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>this</b> prohibition against listening to <b>malicious speech, even though one should not accept</b> the malicious speech as true, <b>one is</b> nevertheless <b>required to be concerned</b> about the harm that might result from ignoring it.
The Gemara cites examples of people who were concerned about malicious speech. There were <b>these people of the Galilee about whom a rumor emerged that they had killed someone. They came before Rabbi Tarfon</b> and <b>said to him: Will the Master hide us?</b> Rabbi Tarfon <b>said to them: What should we do? If I do not hide you,</b> your pursuers <b>will see you</b> and kill you. If <b>I do hide you,</b> this too is problematic, as <b>didn’t the Rabbis say:</b> With regard to <b>this</b> prohibition against listening to <b>malicious speech, even though one should not accept</b> the malicious speech as true, <b>one is required to be concerned</b> about the harm that might result from ignoring it? Therefore, <b>you</b> must <b>go</b> and <b>hide yourselves.</b>
The Gemara cites another case of a report that caused concern. Before the battle against Og, king of Bashan, it is stated: <b>“And the Lord said to Moses: Do not fear</b> him; for I have delivered him into your hand, and all his people, and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon” (Numbers 21:34). The Gemara asks: <b>Now, Sihon and Og were brothers, as the Master said: Sihon and Og were sons of Ahijah, son of Shamhazai.</b> In <b>what</b> way is Sihon <b>different from Og, that</b> God found it necessary to warn Moses not to be <b>afraid</b> of Og, <b>and</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> Og <b>different from Sihon, that</b> there was <b>no</b> need for a warning not to be <b>afraid</b> of Sihon?
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: From the answer</b> that God gave <b>to that righteous</b> one, Moses, <b>you know what was in his heart,</b> i.e., what gave Moses cause to fear. Moses <b>said</b> to himself: <b>Perhaps the merit of our forefather Abraham will stand for</b> Og and save him. Og was the one who told Abraham that Lot had been taken captive by the four kings, enabling Abraham to rescue Lot.
The Gemara cites the source of this claim. <b>As it is stated: “And there came one that was saved, and told Abram the Hebrew,</b> now he dwelt by the terebinths of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshkol, and brother of Aner; and these were confederate with Abram. And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan” (Genesis 14:13–14). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that the term “one that was saved” <b>is</b> referring to <b>Og, who was saved from</b> the punishment of <b>the generation of the flood.</b> For this reason, Moses was more afraid of Og.
§ The Gemara cites another instance in which an impure item was lost, similar to the case discussed above involving the pile of stones. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Menstrual blood is itself a source of impurity. With regard to <b>a garment in which</b> a blood <b>stain was lost,</b> i.e., it is difficult to determine if the blood is still on the garment, <b>one applies to it,</b> i.e., scrubs it with, <b>seven</b> abrasive <b>substances</b> that are known to remove blood stains, <b>and</b> thereby <b>nullifies</b> the blood stain, so that the garment is pure. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b>

Daf 61b

<b>He examines it section by section,</b> as by examining each part of the garment separately he will discover any remaining blood stain.
In the case of a garment <b>in which a seminal emission,</b> which is also ritually impure, <b>was lost,</b> i.e., it is not known where on the garment the semen is, if the garment is <b>new, one examines it by</b> sticking <b>a needle</b> into every part of it. In this manner he will feel if the semen is in the garment. If the garment is <b>worn out, one examines it by</b> holding it up to <b>the sun,</b> as the sun’s rays will not pass through the stained part of the garment. It was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>section</b> mentioned need <b>not</b> be <b>less than three</b> fingerbreadths by three <b>fingerbreadths</b> in area.
The Gemara cites another case of a garment in which something was lost. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a garment in which diverse kinds,</b> a prohibited mixture of wool and linen, <b>was lost,</b> i.e., it is a wool garment into which a linen thread was sewn or vice versa and it is not known where on the garment the thread is located, <b>one may not sell it to a gentile and one may not</b> even <b>fashion it</b> into <b>a saddlecloth for a donkey.</b> This is prohibited lest one remove a piece of the garment and sew it onto his own clothing. <b>But one may fashion it</b> into <b>a shroud for a corpse,</b> as there is no concern that one might remove it from the dead. <b>Rav Yosef said: That is to say</b> that the <b>mitzvot will be nullified in the future.</b> If this were not the case, then when the dead are resurrected they will be deriving benefit from the garment of diverse kinds in which they were buried.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef, <b>and some say</b> that <b>Rav Dimi</b> said to Rav Yosef: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Mani say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yannai said: They taught</b> that it is permitted to place a corpse in a shroud of diverse kinds <b>only</b> in order <b>to eulogize him, but it is prohibited to bury him</b> in a shroud of diverse kinds? Rav Yosef <b>said to him: Wasn’t it stated with regard to that</b> matter that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>even</b> permitted <b>to bury him</b> in a shroud of diverse kinds?
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning</b> in this regard, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Set apart [<i>ḥofshi</i>] among the dead,</b> like the slain that lie in the grave, whom You remember no more” (Psalms 88:6)? <b>Once a person dies, he becomes free [<i>ḥofshi</i>] from the mitzvot.</b>
§ <b>Rafram bar Pappa says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> With regard to <b>a garment in which diverse kinds was lost, one may dye it, and it is permitted</b> to wear the garment, as wool and linen absorb dye differently, and therefore it will be easy to notice the location of the other kind of thread and remove it. <b>Rava said to Rafram bar Pappa: From where does the Elder,</b> i.e., Rav Ḥisda, derive <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>?
Rafram bar Pappa <b>said to him: It is</b> derived from <b>the mishna, as we learned:</b> With regard to a pile of stones that was known to have an item of ritual impurity buried beneath it, one continues <b>searching</b> beneath each of these piles <b>until he reaches bedrock. And if</b> the impure item <b>is not</b> there, i.e., if he found nothing, one can <b>say</b> that <b>a raven</b> or some other animal <b>took it. So too</b> here, <b>wool and flax,</b> i.e., linen, <b>do not absorb</b> the dye <b>in the same</b> manner. <b>And since</b> he dyed the garment and <b>he does not know</b> of any mixture of linen and wool within it, as the entire garment absorbed the dye in the same way, one must <b>say that</b> that thread <b>has fallen out,</b> and therefore it is permitted to wear the garment.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Yeiva, said in the name of Mar Zutra:</b> In a case of <b>one who put a thread of flax in a cloak of wool and it fell out, but he does not know whether it</b> all <b>fell out or</b> whether it <b>did not</b> all <b>fall out,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to wear the cloak.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is lenient in this case of uncertainty? <b>By Torah law,</b> it <b>is written: “Diverse kinds [<i>sha’atnez</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:11), and this is interpreted as an acronym indicating that the <i>halakha</i> of diverse kinds does not apply <b>unless</b> the item <b>is</b> combed <b>smooth [<i>shua</i>], spun [<i>tavui</i>]</b> as a thread, <b>and woven [<i>nuz</i>].</b> Without these characteristics, the combination is not considered diverse kinds by Torah law. <b>And it is the Sages who decreed</b> that diverse kinds that are merely attached to each other are prohibited, despite the fact that they are not combed and spun together. <b>And</b> in this case, <b>since he does not know if it</b> all <b>fell out</b> it is <b>permitted,</b> as the <i>halakha</i> is lenient with regard to uncertainties involving prohibitions that are by rabbinic law.
<b>Rav Ashi objects to this</b> leniency. One can <b>say</b> that by Torah law it is prohibited if the linen and wool are <b>either combed, or spun, or woven.</b> Perhaps the word <i>sha’atnez</i> does not limit the prohibition to a combination of all three activities, but to any one of them. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Mar Zutra, from</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One expresses</b> the prohibition in the Torah <b>in one word,</b> <i>sha’atnez</i>. Therefore, the term means all three characteristics together.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A colored garment renders</b> a woman <b>impure due to</b> blood <b>stains</b> if she sees a blood stain on it. <b>Rabbi Natan bar Yosef says:</b> If she sees a blood stain on the colored garment <b>she is not impure due to</b> a blood <b>stain, as</b> the Sages <b>enacted</b> that <b>women</b> wear <b>colored garments,</b> and this decree was made <b>only</b> in order <b>to be lenient with regard to their</b> blood <b>stains,</b> i.e., so that they do not become impure.
The Gemara questions Rabbi Natan bar Yosef’s use of the word: Enacted. The Sages <b>enacted? What was their enactment? Rather,</b> Rabbi Natan bar Yosef said the reason <b>that</b> the Sages <b>permitted colored garments to women</b> was <b>only</b> in order <b>to be lenient with regard to her</b> blood <b>stains.</b> The Gemara raises an objection: From the statement that the Sages <b>permitted</b> colored garments one can conclude <b>by inference they were</b> previously <b>prohibited.</b> But was there a time when it was not permitted for women to wear colored garments?
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sota</i> 49a): <b>In the war [<i>bapulmus</i>] of Vespasian they decreed upon the crowns of bridegrooms,</b> i.e., that bridegrooms may no longer wear crowns, <b>and upon the drum [<i>ha’irus</i>],</b> i.e., they also banned the playing of drums. <b>They</b> also <b>sought to decree with regard to colored garments,</b> i.e., that women may not wear such garments, but <b>they said: This is preferable,</b> that women should wear colored garments, <b>in order to be lenient with regard to their</b> blood <b>stains,</b> as a blood stain found on a colored garment does not render a woman ritually impure.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <b>seven substances</b> that <b>one applies to the stain</b> on a garment to ascertain whether it is a blood stain or a dye, as these seven substances remove the blood. They are: <b>Tasteless saliva, and liquid from split beans, and urine, and natron, and <i>borit</i>,</b>

Daf 62a

<b>Cimolian earth [<i>kamonya</i>], and potash [<i>eshlag</i>].</b>
If <b>one immersed</b> the garment with the stain whose nature is unknown <b>and</b> then <b>handled ritually pure items with</b> the garment, and then <b>applied</b> these <b>seven substances to</b> the stain <b>and it did not disappear, that</b> stain <b>is</b> presumably from <b>a dye, and</b> therefore <b>the ritually pure items are pure, and he need not immerse</b> the garment again, as there is no impurity. If the stain <b>disappeared or if it faded, that is</b> a blood <b>stain, and the ritually pure items</b> that he handled <b>are impure, and he must immerse</b> the garment again.
<b>What is tasteless saliva?</b> It is saliva that emerges from the mouth of <b>any</b> person <b>who tasted nothing</b> all night, when he first awakens in the morning. <b>Liquid from split beans</b> is created through <b>the chewing of split beans</b> that <b>divided naturally,</b> not by human hand, which is then applied to the stain. The <b>urine</b> that is an effective detergent is specifically urine <b>that fermented</b> for three days.
<b>And one must rub each and every one</b> of the substances <b>three times</b> over the stain, and one must apply them separately, and one must apply them in the order they are listed in the mishna. If <b>one applied them</b> in a manner that is <b>not in their</b> prescribed <b>order, or if one applied</b> all <b>seven substances simultaneously, he has done nothing.</b> One cannot determine by means of that examination whether it is blood or a dye.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara clarifies the identities of the seven substances that remove blood stains. With regard to natron, a Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: This is referring to <b>Alexandrian natron,</b> i.e., from the city in Egypt, <b>and not natron from Anpantrin,</b> which is of a different quality.
The mishna lists <b><i>borit</i></b> as one of the seven substances. <b>Rav Yehuda says: This</b> is referring to <b>ice plant.</b> The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Borit</i> and ice plant,</b> which indicates that they are two different substances? <b>Rather, what is <i>borit</i>? Sulfur.</b>
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from the <i>baraita</i> discussing the <i>halakha</i> of plants whose use is prohibited during the Sabbatical Year: <b>They added to</b> the list of such plants: Bulbs of <b>ornithogalum, and wormwood,</b> and <b><i>borit</i>, and ice plant. And if it would enter your mind</b> to say that <i>borit</i> is <b>sulfur, is there sulfur</b> that is subject to the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of the Sabbatical Year? But didn’t we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>this is the principle: Anything that has a root</b> and grows <b>is</b> subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>the Sabbatical Year, and</b> anything <b>that does not have a root is not</b> subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>the Sabbatical Year? Rather, what</b> is <b><i>borit</i>?</b> It is <b>ice plant. But isn’t it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: And <b><i>borit</i> and ice plant?</b> The Gemara explains that there are <b>two types</b> of <b>ice plant,</b> one of which is called <i>borit</i>.
With regard to the <b>Cimolian earth</b> mentioned in the mishna, <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> This is the earth referred to as: <b>Pull out, stick in. And</b> with regard to the <b><i>eshlag</i></b> mentioned in the mishna, <b>Shmuel said: I asked</b> all of <b>the seafarers</b> about the identity of <i>eshlag</i>, <b>and they told me it is called <i>ashlega</i>,</b> in Aramaic, <b>and can be found in the shell of the pearl, and is removed with an iron skewer.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>one immersed</b> the garment with the stain whose nature is unknown <b>and</b> then <b>handled</b> ritually pure items with the garment, and then applied these seven substances to the stain and it did not disappear, that stain is a dye, and therefore the ritually pure items are pure, and he need not immerse the garment again, as there is no impurity. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one applied these seven substances to</b> the stain <b>and it did not disappear,</b> but he then applied <b>soap [<i>tzafon</i>] and it disappeared,</b> any <b>ritually pure</b> items that he handled with the garment <b>are impure.</b>
The Gemara raises an objection with regard to this ruling: But <b>soap causes dye to disappear as well;</b> why then should one assume that the stain was blood? <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means that if <b>one applied</b> only <b>six of the</b> seven <b>substances to it and</b> the stain <b>did not disappear,</b> and he then <b>applied soap to</b> the stain <b>and it disappeared,</b> any <b>ritually pure</b> items that he handled with the garment <b>are impure.</b> The reason is <b>that if he had applied</b> all <b>seven</b> substances <b>initially, perhaps</b> the stain would have <b>disappeared,</b> proving that it was blood. Consequently, the garment is rendered impure due to uncertainty.
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one applied</b> the <b>seven substances to</b> the stain <b>and it did not disappear,</b> indicating that it is a dye, and he then <b>repeated</b> and applied the seven substances a second time <b>and</b> the stain <b>disappeared,</b> any <b>ritually pure</b> items that he handled with the garment remain <b>ritually pure.</b>
In explanation of this <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rabbi Zeira says: They taught</b> that the pure items remain pure <b>only</b> with regard to <b>the ritually pure</b> items <b>that were handled between</b> the <b>first washing</b> with the seven substances <b>and the second</b> washing. <b>But</b> with regard to any <b>pure</b> items <b>that were handled</b> with the garment <b>after</b> the <b>second washing,</b> these <b>pure</b> items become <b>impure, as he was particular about it,</b> i.e., by repeating the washing procedure he showed he was concerned that it might be blood, <b>and</b> the stain <b>disappeared,</b> demonstrating that it was in fact blood.

Daf 62b

<b>Rabbi Abba said to Rav Ashi,</b> with regard to his statement: <b>Does</b> the <b>matter</b> of purity or impurity <b>depend on</b> whether or not one is <b>particular</b> about the blood stain? If the items he handled on the garment between the first and second washings are ritually pure, then any items he handled after the second washing should likewise be pure.
Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Yes,</b> the status of purity depends upon whether or not the owner of the garment is particular about the stain. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya says:</b> If one finds <b>blood</b> on a garment that is <b>certainly from a menstruating woman</b> and therefore renders the garment impure, one <b>may apply</b> the <b>seven substances</b> listed in the mishna <b>to it and</b> thereby <b>nullify it</b> from being considered a blood stain at all, even if the stain is not completely removed. And he may then immerse the garment in a ritual bath and it is ritually pure.
Rav Ashi analyzes this ruling: <b>But why</b> is the garment pure? After all, <b>it</b> has <b>blood from a menstruating woman</b> on it. <b>Evidently,</b> the <b>matter</b> of whether or not it is ritually pure <b>depends upon</b> whether or not the owner of the garment <b>is particular</b> about the blood stain. <b>So too</b> here, the <b>matter</b> of whether or not it is ritually pure <b>depends upon</b> whether or not the owner of the garment <b>is particular</b> about the blood stain.
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (see <i>Kelim</i> 9:5): In a case of <b>pottery,</b> i.e., a chamber pot, <b>that a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>] has used</b> and <b>that has absorbed</b> impure <b>liquids</b> from the <i>zav</i>, <b>and</b> it then <b>fell into the air of an oven, and the oven was</b> subsequently <b>heated, the oven is impure, as</b> the impure <b>liquid will eventually emerge</b> from the chamber pot due to the heat of the oven.
The <i>amora’im</i> disagree with regard to the correct interpretation of this mishna. <b>Reish Lakish says: They taught</b> that the oven is impure once it is heated <b>only</b> with regard to <b>liquids</b> of <b>lesser</b> ritual impurity, i.e., that are not primary sources of impurity, such as the tears or urine of one who was rendered impure by contact with a corpse. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>liquids</b> of <b>greater</b> ritual impurity, e.g., urine of a <i>zav</i> or <i>zava</i>, the oven is <b>impure even though the oven was not heated. Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>both liquids</b> of <b>lesser</b> ritual impurity <b>and liquids</b> of <b>greater</b> ritual impurity that fell into an oven, <b>if the oven was heated,</b> then <b>yes,</b> the oven is impure, but <b>if</b> the oven was <b>not</b> heated, it is <b>not</b> impure.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish</b> from the mishna: If <b>one immersed</b> the garment with the stain whose nature is unknown, <b>and</b> then <b>handled ritually pure items with</b> the garment, and then <b>applied</b> these <b>seven substances to</b> the stain <b>and it did not disappear, that</b> stain <b>is</b> presumably from <b>a dye, and</b> therefore <b>the ritually pure items are ritually pure, and he need not immerse</b> the garment again, as there is no impurity. Rabbi Yoḥanan understands that the stain is not definitely from a dye; even if it is from blood, such blood that is absorbed into the garment to the degree that it does not come out after this process is performed, does not impart ritual impurity. The same should apply in the case of the oven, i.e., the liquids should impart impurity only when the oven is heated and they actually emerge.
Reish Lakish <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan in response: <b>Leave</b> aside blood <b>stains,</b> i.e., one cannot cite a proof from them, as they impart impurity <b>by rabbinic law,</b> and for this reason the Sages were lenient and ruled that they do not impart impurity until they actually emerge. But with regard to liquids that are impure by Torah law, the <i>halakha</i> is different.
Rabbi Yoḥanan raises another objection to Reish Lakish: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach:</b> If one finds <b>blood</b> on a garment that is <b>certainly from a menstruating woman</b> and therefore renders the garment impure, one <b>may apply</b> the <b>seven substances</b> listed in the mishna <b>to it and nullify</b> the stain from being considered a blood stain at all, even if the stain is not entirely removed; and he may then immerse the garment in a ritual bath and it is ritually pure?
Reish Lakish <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan in response: You cannot raise an objection to me from the <i>baraita</i> of Rabbi Ḥiyya, since if <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>did not teach</b> this <i>halakha</i> in the Mishna, <b>from where</b> did <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> learn it? Rabbi Ḥiyya was a student of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, and therefore he could not have included a <i>halakha</i> that contradicts the Mishna. Consequently, this statement in his name must be erroneous.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish</b> from a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 3:2): With regard to <b>a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of blood</b> from a corpse <b>that was absorbed in</b> the floor of <b>a house,</b> every vessel in <b>the house is ritually impure</b> by virtue of being under the same roof as the blood. The Gemara parenthetically notes: <b>And some say</b> that the mishna states that every vessel in <b>the house is ritually pure. And</b> these two statements <b>do not disagree,</b> as <b>this</b> first statement was issued <b>in</b> reference to <b>vessels that</b> were in the house <b>at the outset,</b> before the blood became absorbed; and <b>this</b> second statement was issued <b>in</b> reference to <b>vessels that</b> came into the house <b>at the end,</b> after the blood had already been absorbed.
The mishna continues: In a case where the blood <b>was absorbed in a garment,</b> it is examined. <b>If</b> the garment <b>is washed and a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of blood emerges from it, it is ritually impure</b> and it imparts impurity to the vessels in the house as well. <b>But if not,</b> then <b>it is pure,</b> and it does not impart impurity. Apparently, only blood that can be removed from a garment is considered blood, whereas blood absorbed in the garment is insignificant. This is in accordance with the opinion that an absorbed substance does not impart ritual impurity, even if it can be removed in some manner.
<b>Rav Kahana said</b> in response: <b>They taught here</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> among <b>the leniencies</b> that apply to the measurement <b>of a quarter-</b><i>log</i>. That is, this case <b>is different,</b> as the mishna is referring to <b>the blood of submission</b> discharged from a body at the time of death, and such blood is ritually impure <b>by rabbinic law.</b> But in general, a ritually impure liquid that is absorbed into an item does impart impurity.
<b>Reish Lakish raised an objection to Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> from a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 3:2): <b>Any</b> liquid <b>that is absorbed</b> but <b>that is unable to emerge is pure.</b> Reish Lakish infers from this mishna that if <b>it is able to emerge it is impure, and</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though it has not</b> yet <b>emerged.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> in defense of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion: <b>Anywhere that</b> the liquid <b>is unable to emerge and</b> the owner of the garment <b>is not particular about it,</b> i.e., he is not bothered that this liquid is absorbed within the garment, <b>everyone,</b> i.e., both Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, <b>agrees</b> that the garment <b>is pure.</b> If the liquid <b>is able to emerge and</b> the owner of the garment <b>is particular about it</b> and does not want it in his garment, <b>everyone agrees</b> that the garment <b>is impure.</b>
<b>They disagree when</b> the liquid <b>is able to emerge and</b> the owner <b>is not particular about it.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Reish Lakish, <b>holds</b> that <b>since</b> the liquid <b>is able to emerge, even though</b> the owner <b>is not particular about it,</b> the garment is impure. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that <b>even though</b> the liquid <b>is able to emerge,</b>

Daf 63a

<b>if he is particular</b> that he does not want the liquid there, then <b>yes,</b> it renders the garment impure, but <b>if not,</b> then the liquid does <b>not</b> render the garment impure.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>What is tasteless saliva?</b> A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: What is the definition of tasteless saliva? <b>Any</b> saliva <b>where</b> the person <b>had not tasted anything since the evening. Rav Pappa,</b> who was sitting <b>before Rava, thought to say:</b> This <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of the <b>one who said</b> that <b>he did not eat anything</b> all <b>night</b> long. <b>Rava said to him: Is it taught:</b> One who had not tasted anything <b>in the evening,</b> which would indicate that it is referring only to one who did not eat since nightfall? No, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches:</b> Where the person had not tasted anything <b>since the evening,</b> which means even if he ate after nightfall, but did not eat for the rest of the night. This serves <b>to exclude</b> a case <b>where he</b> arose <b>early</b> in the morning <b>and ate,</b> as in such a case it is no longer tasteless saliva.
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What is tasteless saliva? Any</b> saliva <b>where</b> the person did not eat any food and <b>he passed the middle of the night and</b> he was <b>in</b> a state of <b>sleep.</b> The Gemara asks: Is that <b>to say that the matter depends on</b> whether or not he had <b>sleep? But didn’t we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Even if <b>he slept the entire day, that is not tasteless saliva;</b> but if <b>he was awake the entire night, that is tasteless saliva?</b> This indicates that sleep is not a critical factor in producing tasteless saliva. The Gemara resolves this apparent contradiction by explaining that <b>there,</b> in the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i>, it is referring to a case <b>where</b> he was awake all night and did not sleep properly, but <b>was dozing</b> off and on.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>dozing? Rav Ashi said:</b> It is referring to a situation in which one is <b>asleep and</b> yet <b>not</b> fully <b>asleep,</b> and <b>awake and</b> yet <b>not</b> fully <b>awake. If someone calls him he answers, and he is</b> in a mental state in which <b>he does not know</b> how <b>to provide</b> an answer that requires logical <b>reasoning, but when people remind him</b> about something when he is in that state that has happened previously <b>he remembers</b> it.
A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>rose</b> early in the morning <b>and learned</b> aloud <b>his chapter</b> of the Torah, <b>that</b> saliva in his mouth is <b>not tasteless saliva,</b> as speech weakens the strength of the saliva. <b>And how much</b> learning and talk removes the strength of the saliva? <b>Rav Yehuda bar Sheila says</b> that <b>Rav Ashi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Any</b> case <b>where he uttered most of his</b> normal amount of <b>speech</b> that he usually says <b>in three hours.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Liquid from split beans</b> is created through <b>the chewing of split beans</b> that divided naturally, not by human hand, which are then applied to the stain. The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that this ruling <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish, as Reish Lakish said: Tasteless saliva must be</b> mixed <b>with each and every one</b> of the other six substances in order to remove the blood stain. The Gemara answers that this is no proof, as <b>perhaps</b> it is not due to the saliva, but rather <b>the heat of his mouth</b> is what <b>helps</b> the split beans remove the stain.
The Gemara notes that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: The liquid from split beans</b> is effective in removing blood stains only when it is <b>boiling, and before [<i>over</i>] one puts salt into</b> the pot.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that</b> the word <b><i>over</i> is a formulation of priority? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said that the verse states: “And Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran [<i>vayya’avor</i>] the Cushite”</b> (II Samuel 18:23), i.e., Ahimaaz overtook the Cushite. <b>Abaye said:</b> It is derived <b>from here: “And he passed [<i>avar</i>] before them”</b> (Genesis 33:3). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the proof is <b>from here: “And their king passed [<i>vayya’avor</i>] before them and the Lord at their head”</b> (Micah 2:13).
§ The mishna teaches: The <b>urine</b> that is an effective detergent is specifically urine <b>that fermented.</b> A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: For <b>how</b> long must it be <b>fermented?</b> For <b>three days.</b>
On the topic of the urine used to remove a blood stain, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: All the measures of the Sages with regard to</b> blood <b>stains require a measure for their measure.</b> There are many types of urine, each of which has different properties, and it is unclear which is to be used. Is it urine <b>of a young</b> person <b>or of an old</b> person? Is it urine <b>of a man or of a woman?</b> Is it urine that has been kept <b>covered or uncovered?</b> Is it urine <b>from the summer or from the rainy season?</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And one must rub</b> each and every one of the substances <b>three times. Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma</b> with regard to this rubbing: Is the <b>going and coming</b> of the hand over the surface of the rubbed item considered <b>one</b> rubbing, <b>or perhaps</b> the <b>going and coming</b> are considered <b>two</b> actions and two distinct rubbings? <b>What</b> is the correct count? The Gemara states: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The mishna further teaches: If <b>one applied them</b> in a manner that is <b>not in their</b> prescribed <b>order,</b> or if one applied all seven substances simultaneously, he has done nothing. <b>The Sages taught</b> two <i>baraitot</i> with regard to this matter. If one applied the substances from the <b>second</b> half of the list, i.e., natron, <i>borit</i>, Cimolian earth, and potash, <b>before the</b> substances from the <b>first</b> half of the list, i.e., tasteless saliva, liquid from split beans, and urine, it <b>is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: The <b>second</b> set <b>count for him,</b> but the <b>first do not count for him. And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The <b>first count for him,</b> but the <b>second do not count for him.</b>
<b>Abaye said</b> that there is no dispute between these two <i>baraitot</i>: Both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> agree that the substances that he applied <b>second count for him, and not</b> the substances that he applied <b>first. And what</b> does the second <i>baraita</i> mean when it uses the term: <b>First?</b> It means the <b>first according to the order</b> of the mishna, which were the <b>second in their application.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> For <b>any woman who has</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle</b> that is not time dependent, but is dependent on a physical sensation, <b>her time is sufficient,</b> i.e., she does not transmit ritual impurity retroactively, for twenty-four hours or until the last time she examined herself (see 2a). <b>And these are the</b> fixed menstrual <b>cycles</b> based on sensation: When a woman menstruates after <b>she yawns [<i>mefaheket</i>], or</b> after <b>she sneezes, or</b> after <b>she senses</b> pain <b>near her stomach or in her lower abdomen, or</b> after <b>she secretes</b> a discharge, <b>or</b> after <b>a type of</b> feverish <b>shuddering [<i>tzemarmorot</i>] overtakes her. And likewise</b> the same applies with regard to any sensation <b>of the like. And</b> in the case of <b>any</b> woman <b>who establishes</b> a pattern <b>for herself</b> by experiencing such a sensation <b>three times</b> before the onset of menstruation, <b>that is</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that for any woman who has a fixed menstrual cycle, her time is sufficient. The Gemara objects: <b>We</b> already <b>learned</b> that her time is sufficient on <b>another occasion</b> (2a): For <b>any woman who has</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle,</b> and she examined herself at that time and discovered blood, <b>her time is sufficient,</b> and it is only from that moment that she transmits ritual impurity. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> it is referring <b>to</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle of</b> a certain number of <b>days; here,</b> it is referring <b>to</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle based on a physical</b> sensation.
<b>As it teaches</b> in the continuation of the mishna: <b>These are the</b> fixed menstrual <b>cycles</b> based on sensation: When a woman menstruates after <b>she yawns,</b> or after <b>she sneezes, or</b> after <b>she senses</b> pain <b>near her stomach or in her lower abdomen, or</b> after <b>she secretes</b> a discharge. All of these are physical sensations.
The mishna includes the case where <b>she secretes</b> a discharge as one of the physical sensations. The Gemara understands this as referring to a continuous discharge of blood, and therefore asks: <b>But</b> during menstruation <b>she is continuously discharging</b> blood; how can this be a signal of the onset of menstruation? <b>Ulla, son of Rav Ilai, said:</b>

Daf 63b

The mishna is referring to a case <b>where she discharges ritually impure blood in the midst of</b> discharging <b>ritually pure blood.</b> For example, if she normally first discharges blood that is not red, and it therefore does not render her impure, and then she experiences a discharge of red blood.
The mishna teaches: <b>Or a type of</b> feverish <b>shuddering</b> overtakes her, <b>and likewise</b> the same applies with regard to any sensation <b>of the like.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by this last phrase? <b>Rabba bar Ulla said:</b> It serves <b>to include a woman whose head is heavy upon her or her limbs are heavy upon her, or she trembles or belches</b> constantly.
<b>Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The Sages <b>said, with regard to</b> establishing a set period of <b>days,</b> that <b>two</b> days are sufficient, i.e., if a woman experiences bleeding twice on the same date of the month or after the same interval, she has a fixed menstrual cycle. By contrast, <b>with regard to</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle</b> based on a physical sensation, it is sufficient if she experiences bleeding even <b>once.</b> But <b>for those</b> sensations <b>which the Sages did not include</b> in the mishna, she has a fixed cycle only if she experiences bleeding <b>three</b> times accompanied by one of those symptoms.
The Gemara asks: When Shmuel said: <b>For those which the Sages did not include, what</b> did he intend <b>to add? Rav Yosef says:</b> This serves <b>to add</b> the case mentioned above, i.e., <b>her head is heavy upon her, or her limbs are heavy upon her, or she trembles or belches</b> constantly. <b>Abaye said</b> to Rav Yosef: <b>What is</b> that addition <b>teaching us?</b> In effect, <b>it is</b> already taught in <b>the mishna, as Rabba bar Ulla explained</b> above that the additional phrase: The same applies with regard to any sensation of the like, serves to include those sensations. <b>Rather, Abaye said:</b> Shmuel’s phrase serves <b>to add</b> a case where <b>she ate garlic and saw</b> menstrual blood, <b>or ate onions and saw</b> menstrual blood, or <b>chewed pepper and saw</b> menstrual blood, i.e., these triggers can give rise to a fixed cycle, but only after three occurrences.
<b>Rav Yosef said: I did not hear this tradition</b> concerning the opinion of Shmuel, that with regard to days a cycle is fixed if she experiences bleeding twice, whereas for physical sensations a cycle is fixed after one occurrence. Rav Yosef had fallen ill and forgotten his studies and was therefore unable to remember that such a ruling had been issued.
His student, <b>Abaye, said to him: You</b> yourself <b>told us</b> this <i>halakha</i>, <b>and</b> it was <b>with regard to this</b> following matter that <b>you told</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>to us,</b> taught in the mishna below: If a woman <b>was accustomed to see</b> the flow of blood on the <b>fifteenth day and she deviated</b> from the norm to see the flow of blood <b>on</b> the <b>twentieth day,</b> then on both <b>this</b> day, the fifteenth, <b>and that</b> day, the twentieth, it is <b>prohibited</b> for her to engage in intercourse. If she deviated from the norm to see the flow of blood <b>on</b> the <b>twentieth day three times, it becomes permitted</b> for her to engage in intercourse on the <b>fifteenth day, and she</b> has <b>established the twentieth day for herself</b> as the day of her fixed menstrual cycle, <b>as a woman establishes</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle only after she establishes it three times.</b>
Abaye continues: <b>And you,</b> Rav Yosef, <b>said to us with regard to this</b> mishna that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: This is the statement of Rabban Gamliel bar Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who said</b> it <b>in the name of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. But the Rabbis say:</b> If <b>she saw</b> a discharge of blood even once, she has a fixed cycle and <b>does not need to repeat</b> and experience bleeding a second time <b>or to repeat a third</b> time.
<b>And we said to you:</b> Since <b>you said to us</b> that she does not need <b>to repeat</b> a second time, <b>is it necessary</b> for you to mention that she does not need <b>to repeat a third</b> time? <b>And you said to us</b> that when you said that she does not need <b>to repeat</b> a second time, this is referring <b>to</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle</b> based on a physical sensation, whereas when you said she does not need <b>to repeat a third</b> time, that is referring <b>to</b> a fixed cycle of <b>days.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why did Shmuel have to explain that the mishna is the statement of Rabban Gamliel bar Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi? <b>Let him say</b> simply that <b>this</b> mishna <b>is the statement of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> who always requires repetition three times to establish a presumptive status. The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what <b>Shmuel teaches us: That Rabban Gamliel, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a woman <b>was accustomed to see</b> the flow of blood <b>at the beginning of the</b> sensation that accompanies her <b>fixed</b> cycle, even if on one occasion she happened to experience bleeding only at the end of the sensation, <b>all the ritually pure items that she handled within the</b> duration of that sensation that accompanies her <b>fixed</b> cycle <b>are ritually impure.</b> If the woman was accustomed to experience bleeding <b>at the end of the</b> sensation that accompanies her <b>fixed</b> cycle, <b>all the ritually pure items that she handled within the</b> duration of that sensation that accompanies her <b>fixed</b> cycle <b>are pure.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: Even</b> specific <b>days and</b> specific <b>hours</b> determine a fixed menstrual <b>cycle:</b> If a woman <b>was accustomed to see</b> the flow of blood on a certain day of the month <b>at sunrise,</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> for <b>her</b> to engage in intercourse with her husband <b>only at sunrise;</b> but during the night before and the following day, it is permitted for her to engage in intercourse. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Once sunrise passed and she did not menstruate, <b>the entire day is hers</b> and she may engage in intercourse, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei; but contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, intercourse the night before is prohibited.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what case did Rabbi Yosei say</b> that specific <b>days and hours</b> determine a fixed menstrual <b>cycle?</b> For example, if a woman <b>was accustomed to see</b> the flow of blood <b>on the twentieth day</b> and again <b>on the twentieth day, and in the sixth hour</b> of the day and again <b>in the sixth hour</b> of the day the next time; if the <b>twentieth day arrives</b> a third time <b>and she does not see</b> a flow of blood, <b>it is prohibited for her to engage</b> in intercourse for <b>the entirety of the first six hours</b> of the day; <b>this is the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei deems</b> it <b>permitted</b> for her to engage in intercourse <b>until the sixth hour</b> of the day, <b>and</b> says that she must be <b>concerned</b> only <b>during the sixth hour.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If <b>the sixth hour passed and she did not see</b> a flow of blood, <b>it is prohibited for her to engage</b> in intercourse for <b>the entirety of the day;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And Rabbi Yosei deems</b> it <b>permitted</b> for her to engage in intercourse <b>from <i>minḥa</i></b> time <b>onward,</b> i.e., from the beginning of the seventh hour.
§ The mishna teaches with regard to a woman who <b>was accustomed to see</b> the flow of blood on a certain day of the month at sunrise, that Rabbi Yehuda says: Once sunrise passed and she did not menstruate, the entire day is hers and she may engage in intercourse, but intercourse is prohibited the night before. The Gemara objects: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: The entire night is hers?</b> This indicates that she may engage in intercourse during the night.
The Gemara explains that it is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> when it is permitted for her to engage in intercourse the entire night, it is referring to a case <b>where she is accustomed to see</b> a flow of blood <b>at the beginning of the day,</b> i.e., immediately after sunrise. <b>And there,</b> in the mishna, which deems it prohibited for her to engage in intercourse all night, it is referring to a case <b>where she is accustomed to see</b> a flow of blood <b>at the end of the night,</b> i.e., just before sunrise.
The Gemara cites further <i>baraitot</i> that deal with Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion. It <b>is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> it <b>prohibited for her</b> to engage in intercourse <b>before</b> the time of <b>her</b> fixed <b>cycle, but deems</b> it <b>permitted for her</b> to do so <b>after</b> the time of <b>her</b> fixed <b>cycle</b> if she did not experience bleeding then. <b>And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: Rabbi Yehuda <b>deems</b> it <b>prohibited for her</b> to engage in intercourse <b>after</b> the time of <b>her</b> fixed <b>cycle but deems</b> it <b>permitted for her</b> to do so <b>before</b> the time of <b>her</b> fixed <b>cycle.</b>
The Gemara resolves this apparent contradiction: <b>And</b> this is <b>not difficult; here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that rules that it is prohibited for her to engage in intercourse before the time of her fixed cycle is referring to a case <b>where she is accustomed to see</b> a flow of blood <b>at the end of the night.</b> By contrast, <b>there,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that states that it is prohibited for her to do so after the time of her fixed cycle is referring to a case <b>where she is accustomed to see</b> a flow of blood <b>at the beginning of the day.</b>
<b>Rava said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rava</b> actually <b>say this? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a menstruating woman: <b>“You shall separate the children of Israel from their impurity”</b> (Leviticus 15:31). <b>From here, Rabbi Yirmeya said</b> that there is <b>a warning to the children of Israel that they should separate from their wives close to</b> the time of <b>their</b> menstrual <b>cycles.</b>
<b>And how</b> close? <b>Rava says: One</b> twelve-hour <b>period,</b> i.e., either from sunrise to sunset, or from sunset to sunrise. The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>What, is it not</b> referring to <b>an additional</b> twelve-hour <b>period,</b> i.e., the prohibition applies to the time of her expected period itself, either day or night, as well as the previous twelve hours? This is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who deems it prohibited for her to engage in intercourse only for the twelve hours of the expected time of her period. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is referring to <b>that</b> same twelve-hour <b>period.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And why do I</b> need <b>two</b> statements of Rava, i.e., both that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda and that a woman must separate for only one twelve-hour period? The Gemara answers that both are <b>necessary, because if</b> Rava had <b>taught us</b> only <b>this,</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda in the mishna, <b>I would say</b> that <b>this statement</b> applies only <b>to</b> the handling of <b>pure</b> items, <b>but with regard to</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>her husband,</b> it does <b>not</b> apply, and with regard to intercourse, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei. Therefore, Rava <b>teaches us</b> that even with regard to intercourse, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.
<b>And</b> by contrast, <b>if</b> Rava had taught us only <b>that</b> statement, that she must wait a twelve-hour period, <b>I would say</b> that she must separate <b>close to</b> the fixed time of <b>her cycle</b> for <b>an additional</b> twelve-hour <b>period,</b> as suggested above. Therefore, Rava <b>teaches us</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, which indicates that she separates for only <b>that</b> single twelve-hour <b>period.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If the woman <b>was accustomed to see</b> the flow of blood on the <b>fifteenth day and she deviated</b> from the norm <b>to see</b> the flow of blood <b>on</b> the <b>twentieth day,</b> then on both <b>this</b> day, the fifteenth, <b>and that</b> day, the twentieth, it is <b>prohibited</b> for her to engage in intercourse. If <b>she deviated</b> from the norm <b>twice,</b> then on both <b>this</b> day, the fifteenth, <b>and that</b> day, the twentieth, it is likewise <b>prohibited</b> for her to engage in intercourse.
If <b>she deviated</b> from the norm <b>to see</b> the flow of blood <b>on</b> the <b>twentieth day three times, it becomes permitted</b> for her to engage in intercourse on the <b>fifteenth, and she</b> has <b>established the twentieth day for herself</b> as the day of her fixed menstrual cycle, <b>as a woman establishes</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle only after she establishes it three times. And</b> a woman <b>is purified from the</b> existing fixed menstrual <b>cycle,</b> in the sense that intercourse is permitted on that day, <b>only when she has been displaced from</b> that day <b>three times.</b>

Daf 64a

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It was stated:</b> If a woman <b>saw</b> menstrual blood on the <b>fifteenth of this month, and</b> on the <b>sixteenth of</b> the <b>month</b> after <b>that, and</b> on the <b>seventeenth of</b> the <b>month</b> after <b>that, Rav says: She has</b> thereby <b>determined her</b> menstrual <b>cycle by skipping,</b> i.e., as a month and a day. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> Her menstrual cycle is not determined <b>until she skips</b> a day <b>three times.</b> According to Shmuel, as the cycle is established in this case not by the date itself but by the pattern of one additional day every month, the pattern is established only when this occurs three consecutive times, i.e., when she menstruates on the fourth occasion.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>Rav and Shmuel disagree with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute between Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman <b>was married to</b> her <b>first</b> husband <b>and he died,</b> and was then married <b>to a second</b> one <b>and he</b> too <b>died, she may not marry a third</b> husband; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: She may marry a third</b> husband, but if he also dies <b>she may not marry a fourth</b> husband. The suggestion is that Rav and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi hold that after two instances she has established a presumption and a pattern, whereas Shmuel and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel maintain that the presumption is established only after three occurrences.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No, everyone agrees</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> that a presumption is established only after three times, <b>and here they disagree with regard to this</b> matter: <b>Rav holds</b> that when she experienced bleeding on the <b>fifteenth</b> of the month, that occasion is also one <b>of the number,</b> i.e., it counts as the first of the pattern, which therefore has three elements. <b>And Shmuel holds</b> that <b>since she did not see</b> the first time after <b>skipping,</b> i.e., after having experienced bleeding on the fourteenth of the previous month, <b>it is not</b> part of <b>the number,</b> which means that she has experienced bleeding only twice in accordance with that pattern.
Shmuel <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of Rav from a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman <b>was accustomed to see</b> a flow of blood on the <b>fifteenth day</b> of the month, <b>and deviated</b> and instead experienced bleeding <b>on the sixteenth day</b> of the month, on both <b>this</b> day, the fifteenth, <b>and that</b> day, the sixteenth, it is <b>prohibited</b> for her to engage in intercourse with her husband. If she then <b>deviated</b> and experienced bleeding <b>on the seventeenth day</b> of the following month, <b>the sixteenth</b> day becomes <b>permitted, and the fifteenth and seventeenth</b> days of the following month <b>are prohibited.</b>
If she subsequently <b>deviated</b> and experienced bleeding <b>on</b> the <b>eighteenth day</b> of the following month, <b>all</b> the days <b>are permitted.</b> The fifteenth is permitted because she has now experienced bleeding three times on a different day, while the other days are permitted because she experienced bleeding only once on each day. <b>And</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> for her to engage in intercourse in the following month <b>only from</b> the <b>eighteenth</b> day <b>and onward,</b> i.e., on the nineteenth day, since she has now established a pattern of bleeding after one month and one day. This is <b>difficult for Rav,</b> as he maintains that twice is sufficient to establish a pattern, whereas this <i>baraita</i> requires three instances. <b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you</b> in response: Since she <b>was accustomed</b> to experience bleeding on the fifteenth <b>it is different.</b> In that particular case the fifteenth does not count as the beginning of a new pattern because it was already her regular established time.
The Gemara expresses surprise at Shmuel’s question: <b>And he who asked [<i>udeka’arei</i>] it, why did he ask it?</b> The <i>baraita</i> clearly stresses the fact that the woman began with an established fixed menstrual cycle that was not part of the pattern. Shmuel could answer: <b>It was necessary</b> for the <i>baraita</i> to teach the case where she <b>was accustomed</b> to experience bleeding on a specific day, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>since she was accustomed</b> to experience bleeding on a specific day <b>and displaced</b> that pattern by bleeding on a different day, it should be sufficient that <b>with two times she displaces it.</b> For this reason, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that an established pattern is displaced only after three occasions where she experiences bleeding on a different day. If it is not established, one displacement is enough.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman <b>saw</b> a flow of blood on the <b>twenty-first day of this month,</b> the <b>twenty-second day of that month,</b> i.e., of the next month, and the <b>twenty-third day of that month,</b> i.e., of the third month, <b>she established a fixed</b> pattern of bleeding after one month and one day. If in the third month she instead <b>varied</b> and experienced bleeding <b>on</b> the <b>twenty-fourth day</b> of the month, <b>she has not established a fixed</b> pattern, as this last interval was one month and two days long. This is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel,</b> as according to the <i>baraita</i> the pattern is established after only two equidistant intervals, whereas Shmuel requires three.
The Gemara answers that <b>Shmuel</b> could have <b>said to you: Here, we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the woman <b>was accustomed to see</b> a flow of blood <b>on</b> the <b>twentieth day</b> of the month, <b>and she deviated</b> and experienced bleeding <b>on the twenty-first day</b> of the month. Consequently, there were in fact a total of three equidistant intervals of one month and one day. The Gemara adds that the language of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is also precise, as</b> for what other reason would the <i>baraita</i> <b>leave</b> aside the <b>twentieth day</b> of the month and not use that date as the example, <b>and</b> instead <b>take</b> for its example the <b>twenty-first day</b> of the month? <b>Learn from this</b> that she had an established pattern of bleeding on the twentieth of every month before the events described in the <i>baraita</i>.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>As a woman establishes a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle only after she establishes it</b> three times. <b>Rav Pappa says,</b> in explanation: <b>We said</b> that she must experience bleeding three times <b>only with regard to establishing</b> a fixed menstrual cycle, <b>but with regard to</b> being <b>concerned</b> for a pattern, even <b>after one time she must be concerned</b> that this might be the beginning of a fixed pattern.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rav Pappa <b>teaching us? We learn</b> this in the mishna: If the woman <b>was accustomed to see</b> the flow of blood on the <b>fifteenth day and she deviated</b> from the norm <b>to see</b> the flow of blood <b>on</b> the <b>twentieth day,</b> on both <b>this</b> day, the fifteenth, <b>and that</b> day, the twentieth, it is <b>prohibited</b> for her to engage in intercourse. This clearly demonstrates that even after bleeding only once on a certain day she must be concerned that this could be the start of a new fixed menstrual cycle.
The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> this <i>halakha</i> was derived only <b>from there, I would say</b> that <b>this statement</b> applies in a case <b>where</b> she experiences bleeding on the twentieth day while <b>she is standing in her days</b> suitable for <b>menstruation,</b> i.e., the days following the eleven days after her last period, when she is most likely to menstruate. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where she is not standing in her days</b> suitable for <b>menstruation,</b> but rather during the eleven days when uterine bleeding would render her a <i>zava</i>, <b>I would say</b> that she does <b>not</b> need to be concerned that she might experience bleeding again at that time. Therefore, Rav Pappa <b>teaches us</b> that even during these eleven days she must be concerned.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> a woman <b>is purified from the</b> existing fixed menstrual <b>cycle,</b> in the sense that intercourse is permitted on that day, <b>only</b> when she has been displaced from that day three times. <b>Rav Pappa says,</b> in explanation: <b>We said</b> this <b>only</b> in the case of a set cycle <b>that she established</b> by <b>three times.</b> With regard to such a cycle, we said <b>that</b> a different <b>three times are necessary to displace</b> that cycle. <b>But</b> with regard to a cycle that is established with only <b>two times, it is displaced by one time</b> of bleeding on a different day.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rav Pappa <b>teaching us? We learn</b> this in the mishna: <b>A woman establishes</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle only after she establishes it three times.</b> The Gemara answers that it was necessary for Rav Pappa to teach his <i>halakha</i>, <b>lest you say</b> that a cycle is displaced by bleeding <b>one</b> time on a different day <b>for</b> a cycle that was set <b>one</b> time, but by bleeding on <b>two</b> different days <b>for</b> a cycle that was established with <b>two</b> times, <b>and</b> likewise by bleeding on <b>three</b> different days <b>for</b> a cycle that was established with <b>three</b> times. Therefore, Rav Pappa <b>teaches us</b> that whether she experiences bleeding once or twice, she displaces it by bleeding once on a different day.
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Pappa:</b> If a woman <b>was accustomed to see</b> the flow of blood on the <b>twentieth day</b> after her previous flow, <b>and she deviated</b> from the norm to experience bleeding <b>on</b> the <b>thirtieth day,</b> on both <b>this</b> day, the twentieth, <b>and that</b> day, the thirtieth, it is <b>prohibited</b> for her to engage in intercourse. If the <b>twentieth day arrived,</b> counting from the previous flow, which had occurred on day thirty, <b>and she did not see</b> a flow of blood, <b>it is permitted for her to engage</b> in intercourse <b>until</b> the <b>thirtieth day</b> after the previous flow, <b>and she</b> must be <b>concerned on</b> the <b>thirtieth day.</b>
If the <b>thirtieth day arrived and she saw</b> a flow of blood, and then the <b>twentieth day</b> after that <b>arrived and she did not see</b> a flow of blood, <b>and</b> the <b>thirtieth day</b> from her previous flow <b>arrived and she did not see</b> blood on that day but saw on a later day, <b>and</b> then the <b>twentieth day</b> after her previous flow <b>arrived and she saw</b> a flow of blood, the <b>thirtieth day becomes permitted,</b> as she experienced bleeding after an interval of thirty days only twice. This is in accordance with the opinion of Rav Pappa that a cycle of bleeding that has occurred twice is displaced by a single time of not bleeding on that day.

Daf 64b

<b>And</b> she is <b>prohibited</b> on the <b>twentieth day, because</b> it is the <b>manner</b> of women that their blood flow <b>comes at its</b> usual <b>time.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Women, with regard to</b> the blood that flows when <b>their hymens</b> are ruptured, <b>are like grapevines: There is a vine that</b> produces <b>wine</b> that <b>is red, and there is a vine that</b> produces <b>wine</b> that <b>is black; and there is a vine that</b> produces <b>wine in abundance, and there is a vine that</b> produces only <b>a meager</b> amount of <b>wine. Rabbi Yehuda says: In every vine, there are</b> grapes fit to produce <b>wine, but</b> any vine in <b>which there are no</b> grapes fit to produce <b>wine, this is a dry vine [<i>durkati</i>].</b> Likewise, any woman who experiences bleeding is capable of giving birth, whereas one who does not experience bleeding is like a dry vine, unable to give birth.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the term <i>durkati</i>, the Gemara explains that this means <b>truncated generation [<i>dor katua</i>].</b> As <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches: Just as leaven is good for dough, so too, blood is good for a woman.</b> It was likewise <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Meir: Any woman whose blood is plentiful, her children are plentiful.</b>

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>a young girl whose time to see</b> a menstrual flow, i.e., the age of puberty, <b>has not</b> yet <b>arrived, and she married</b> and engaged in intercourse and her hymen was torn, <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> The Sages <b>give her four nights</b> after intercourse during which the blood is attributed to the torn hymen and she remains ritually pure. Thereafter, any blood is assumed to be menstrual blood and renders her impure. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> The blood is attributed to the torn hymen <b>until the wound heals.</b>
In the case of a young woman <b>whose time to see</b> a menstrual flow <b>has arrived</b> but she has not yet begun to menstruate, <b>and she married</b> and engaged in intercourse and her hymen was torn, <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> The Sages <b>give her the first night</b> during which the blood is attributed to the torn hymen. Thereafter, any blood is assumed to be menstrual blood. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> The blood is attributed to the torn hymen <b>until the conclusion of Shabbat,</b> and she may engage in intercourse with her husband for <b>four nights,</b> as it was customary for a virgin to marry on Wednesday.
In the case of a young woman who <b>saw</b> menstrual blood before marriage while <b>she was still in her father’s house, Beit Shammai say:</b> The Sages <b>give her</b> permission to engage only in <b>relations</b> that consummate a marriage, which are <b>a mitzva,</b> after which she is ritually impure due to the blood. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> The husband and wife may engage even in several acts of intercourse, as any blood seen <b>throughout the entire night</b> is attributed to the torn hymen.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna first addresses the case of a young girl who has not yet reached puberty. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: And</b> this <i>halakha</i> applies to her <b>even</b> if <b>she has seen</b> menstrual blood. He explains his reasoning: <b>From where</b> do I derive this? I derive it <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>distinguishes in the latter clause</b> of the mishna <b>between</b> a young girl who has <b>seen</b> menstrual blood <b>and</b> a young girl who has <b>not seen</b> menstrual blood. <b>By inference,</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna the <i>halakha</i> <b>is no different</b> in <b>this</b> case, where the young girl has experienced menstrual bleeding, <b>and</b> it <b>is no different</b> in <b>that</b> case, where she has not yet experienced menstrual bleeding.
<b>This</b> explanation of Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Beit Hillel say:</b> With regard to a young girl who has not yet reached puberty, the blood she emits is attributed to the torn hymen <b>until the wound heals,</b> regardless of <b>whether she has seen</b> menstrual blood beforehand or <b>whether she has not</b> yet <b>seen</b> menstrual blood.
§ The mishna teaches that Beit Hillel say: The blood is attributed to the torn hymen <b>until the wound heals.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>Until when</b> can the blood be attributed to the torn hymen? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: All the time that she is <i>noḥeret</i>.</b> Rav Yehuda continues: <b>When</b> I subsequently <b>said this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>before Shmuel, he said to me: This <i>noḥeret</i>, I do not know what it is,</b> nor do I know what Rav means by it. <b>Rather, all the time that the saliva is in</b> her <b>mouth due to sexual intercourse,</b> she may attribute the blood to the torn hymen. Shmuel is using a euphemism, i.e., as long as there is blood in her vagina resulting from sexual intercourse.
The Gemara clarifies: This <b><i>noḥeret</i> that Rav says; what is it like?</b> What did he mean? <b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak said: It was explained to me by Rav</b> as follows: If the young girl <b>stands</b> up <b>and sees</b> blood, but she <b>sits and does not see</b> blood, <b>it is known that the wound has not</b> yet <b>healed,</b> and the blood is still attributed to the torn hymen. Similarly, if she sits <b>on the ground and sees</b> blood, but she sits <b>on cushions and blankets and does not see</b> blood, <b>it is known that the wound has not</b> yet <b>healed</b> and she may attribute the blood to the torn hymen, as the blood flows due to the strain of sitting on the ground. But if she sometimes sits <b>on all of them,</b> i.e., the ground, cushions, and blankets, <b>and sees</b> blood, and on other occasions she sits <b>on all of them and does not see</b> blood, <b>it is known that the wound has healed,</b> and this blood must now be menstrual blood.
§ The mishna teaches: In the case of a young woman <b>whose time</b> to see a menstrual flow <b>has arrived,</b> Beit Hillel say: The blood is attributed to the torn hymen until the conclusion of Shabbat and she may engage in intercourse with her husband for four nights. <b>It was stated</b> that there is a dispute between <i>amora’im</i> with regard to the following case: If <b>she engaged in intercourse</b> with her husband <b>during the daytime,</b> in addition to engaging in intercourse at night, <b>Rav says: She has not lost</b> her <b>nights,</b> and the blood is still attributed to the torn hymen for four nights. <b>Levi says: She has lost</b> her <b>nights,</b> since she has engaged in intercourse twice during the daytime and twice at night, and therefore she has already used up the equivalent of four nights.
The Gemara explains: <b>Rav says</b> that <b>she has not lost</b> her <b>nights,</b> as <b>we learned</b> in the mishna that the blood is attributed to the torn hymen <b>until the conclusion of Shabbat,</b> and it does not limit the number of times she may engage in intercourse during that time. <b>And Levi says: She has lost</b> her <b>nights,</b> as <b>what</b> is the meaning of the term: <b>Four nights, that is taught</b> in the mishna? It means <b>four</b> twelve-hour <b>periods,</b> either days or nights.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, why do I</b> need the mishna <b>to teach: Four nights?</b> The mishna should have stated four days, which would include both days and nights. Rav would respond that the mishna <b>teaches us proper conduct, as it is proper that intercourse</b> should be performed only <b>at night.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Levi, let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> only: <b>Four nights. Why do I</b> need the mishna to specify: <b>Until the conclusion of Shabbat?</b> Levi would answer that <b>this teaches us that it is permitted to engage in intercourse for the first</b> time <b>on Shabbat.</b> Since the custom was for a virgin to marry on Wednesday, which means that one of the four first nights is Shabbat, it is permitted to engage in intercourse on that night, despite the fact that it may cause her to bleed.
The Gemara notes that Levi’s ruling is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel, as Shmuel said: It is permitted to enter into a narrow opening</b> in a wall <b>on Shabbat, and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though</b> doing so <b>causes pebbles to fall</b> from the wall. Similarly, although engaging in intercourse might cause a wound and bleeding, it is permitted on Shabbat.
It <b>was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> engaged in a dispute: If a husband <b>engaged in intercourse</b> with a virgin <b>and did not find blood, and</b> he <b>went back</b> within the first four nights <b>and</b> again <b>engaged in intercourse</b> with her <b>and</b> this time he <b>found blood, Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> The wife is <b>ritually impure,</b> as this is menstruation blood. <b>And Rabbi Asi says: She is ritually pure,</b> as it is blood from the wound resulting from the act of intercourse.
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: She is ritually impure, as if it is so that it is blood</b> from her hymen, i.e., the blood of her <b>virginity, it would have come at the outset,</b> after the first time they engaged in intercourse. <b>And Rabbi Asi said: She is ritually pure,</b> as <b>perhaps it happened for him</b> that he engaged in intercourse <b>like Shmuel</b> described. <b>As Shmuel said: I can engage in intercourse several times without</b> the appearance of <b>blood.</b> In other words, I can engage in intercourse with a virgin while leaving her hymen intact. <b>And the other</b> Sage, Rabbi Ḥanina, does not allow for that possibility, since he maintains that <b>Shmuel is different, as his strength</b> was <b>great.</b> Shmuel was particularly skilled at this, while others cannot accomplish this.
§ The mishna teaches the <i>halakha</i> of a young girl. The Gemara discusses the case of a girl who is older than twelve and a half. <b>Rav says:</b> The Sages <b>give a grown woman,</b> who engaged in intercourse on her wedding night, <b>the</b> entire <b>first night,</b> during which she may engage in intercourse with her husband several times. <b>And this statement</b> applies only <b>if she did not see</b> any blood. <b>But</b> if <b>she saw</b> blood, <b>she has only the relations</b> that consummate a marriage, which are <b>a mitzva, and nothing more.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav’s statement from a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident</b> involving a virgin who married, <b>and Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>gave her four nights</b> in which to engage in intercourse <b>within twelve months</b> of her wedding when the blood is considered to be like blood resulting from the torn hymen. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If we say that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>gave her all of</b> those nights of purity <b>in</b> her <b>days</b> as <b>a minor,</b>

Daf 65a

in accordance with the ruling of the mishna: The Sages give her four nights, then he should have given her longer, as <b>we learned</b> in the mishna that according to Beit Hillel the blood may be attributed to the torn hymen <b>until the wound heals.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> you will say <b>that he gave her</b> these four nights <b>all</b> during her <b>days</b> as <b>a young woman. Are there twelve months</b> when one has the status of <b>a young woman? But didn’t Shmuel say: The difference</b> in time <b>between</b> becoming <b>a young woman and</b> becoming <b>a grown woman is only six months? And if you would say</b> that Shmuel is saying that it is in <b>less than</b> six months <b>that there is no</b> transition from young woman to grown woman status, but <b>there is</b> such a transition in <b>more</b> than six months, as women develop differently, that is not so, <b>as</b> Shmuel <b>said: Only,</b> which indicates that the period is neither less nor more than six months.
<b>Rather,</b> you will suggest <b>that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>gave her two</b> days <b>during</b> her <b>days as a minor, and</b> he gave her <b>two</b> days <b>during</b> her <b>days as a young woman.</b> This too is difficult, as <b>Rav Ḥinnana bar Shelamya asked Rav:</b> With regard to a young girl who married before she reached puberty, and then <b>her time to see</b> menstrual blood <b>arrived</b> while she was <b>under</b> the authority of <b>her husband, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does she have the four nights when the blood is considered to be from her torn hymen?
And Rav <b>said to him: All the acts of intercourse that you engage in</b> while she is still too young <b>are</b> considered as <b>only one</b> act of intercourse, <b>and the remainder,</b> i.e., three more acts of intercourse, <b>complete</b> the total number of <b>four nights.</b> If so, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi could not have given her two nights as a minor, since at most those acts of intercourse count as one.
<b>Rather,</b> you will suggest <b>that he gave her one</b> night <b>during her days as a minor, and two</b> nights <b>during her days as a young woman, and one</b> night <b>during her days as a grown woman.</b> But this is also difficult: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>we generally give a grown woman more</b> than one night, then one can understand why Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi gave her one night in this case: <b>Just as</b> all the acts of intercourse she engaged in as <b>a minor have the effect to deduct one</b> night <b>for</b> her <b>days as a young woman,</b> similarly all the acts of intercourse she engaged in while <b>a young woman have the effect to deduct one</b> night <b>for</b> her days as <b>a grown woman,</b> leaving her with one.
<b>But if you say</b> that <b>we generally do not give a grown woman more</b> than one night, then in this case Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>should</b> have <b>given her</b> as a grown woman <b>only</b> the one act of <b>relations</b> that consummate a marriage, which are <b>a mitzva,</b> i.e., merely a single act of intercourse, <b>and nothing more,</b> as otherwise the acts of intercourse before she became a grown woman would not have affected her status.
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the correct explanation is <b>that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>gave her one</b> night <b>during her days as a minor and three</b> nights <b>during her days as a young woman.</b> And as for the fact that she has the status of a young woman for only exactly six months, <b>do you maintain</b> that <b>every three months</b> was counted as <b>one period</b> of the husband’s absence, such that she had only two nights in six months? This is not the case. Rather, <b>every two months</b> was counted as <b>one period,</b> and therefore she had three nights during these six months when she could attribute the blood to her torn hymen.
The Gemara relates that the Sage <b>Minyamin Saksana was coming and walking to the place of Shmuel. He thought</b> that he <b>would perform an action in accordance</b> with the opinion <b>of Rav,</b> in that he would permit a grown woman to attribute blood to her torn hymen for the entire first night, <b>even</b> though she had already <b>seen</b> menstrual blood before she was married. Minyamin mistakenly <b>said</b> to himself: <b>Rav does not distinguish between</b> a woman who <b>has seen</b> menstrual blood <b>and</b> a woman who <b>has not seen</b> menstrual blood.
<b>Before</b> Minyamin reached Shmuel’s place, <b>he passed away on the road,</b> and he never completed the journey. Upon hearing this, <b>Shmuel recited</b> this verse <b>about Rav: “No mishap shall befall the righteous”</b> (Proverbs 12:21), i.e., God does not allow prohibited acts to come from the statements of the righteous. In this case, Minyamin ruled incorrectly, based on a misunderstanding of Rav’s statement.
Since the Gemara cited Rav Ḥinnana bar Shelamya, it cites another of his statements: <b>Rav Ḥinnana bar Shelamya said in the name of Rav: Once a person’s teeth fall out</b> and he has difficulty eating, <b>his food diminshes</b> accordingly, <b>as it is stated: “And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and lack of bread in all your places”</b> (Amos 4:6). The term “cleanness of teeth” is here a euphemism for having no teeth at all, which leads to a lack of bread.
§ The mishna teaches: In the case of a young woman who <b>saw</b> menstrual blood before marriage, while <b>she was still</b> in her father’s house, Beit Hillel say: They may engage in several acts of intercourse, as any bleeding throughout the entire night is attributed to the torn hymen. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a young woman who <b>saw</b> menstrual blood while <b>she was still in her father’s house, Beit Hillel say: All the night is hers, and</b> the Sages <b>give her</b> one <b>complete period</b> of time during which she may attribute all bleeding to her torn hymen. <b>And how long is a complete period</b> of time in this context? <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel explained</b> that it is one <b>night and half</b> of the next <b>day.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But do we require all this</b> time of one night and half of a day for a complete period? <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of one <b>whose winepresses or olive presses were impure and he wished to prepare</b> his grapes and olives <b>in</b> a state of <b>ritual purity, how does he act?</b> He should <b>rinse the planks</b> used to press the grapes in the winepress, <b>and the palm branches</b> used as brooms, <b>and the troughs,</b>

Daf 65b

and he should <b>clean the</b> pressing <b>baskets</b> with ashes and water if they were made <b>of palm leaves or of hemp [<i>bitzbutz</i>], or leave them dormant</b> if they were made <b>of bast [<i>shifa</i>] or of reeds,</b> because these absorb more of the wine. <b>And how long</b> must one <b>leave them dormant?</b> He must leave them for <b>twelve months. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: He can lay them aside from</b> one <b>wine-pressing</b> season <b>to</b> the next <b>wine-pressing</b> season, <b>or from</b> one <b>olive-pressing</b> season <b>to</b> the next <b>olive-pressing</b> season.
The Gemara interrupts its citation to analyze the <i>baraita</i>: Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel’s statement <b>is</b> the same as that of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> as there are twelve months between one wine-pressing season and the next. The Gemara responds: The difference <b>between them</b> is the matter of the <b>early and late</b> ripening season for grapes. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel does not require a precise measure of twelve months, as the difference in time between ripening seasons can be slightly more or less than that.
The Gemara continues its citation of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: One who wishes to purify</b> the baskets <b>immediately,</b> without waiting a year, <b>purges them in boiling water or scalds them in olive water. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says in the name of Rabbi Yosei: One sets them under a pipe whose water flows</b> constantly <b>or in a spring with rapid waters. And how much</b> time should he leave them there? He should leave them for <b>a period</b> of time. <b>In the</b> same <b>way that</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> this time frame <b>with regard to wine</b> used for <b>a libation</b> in idol worship, <b>so too</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> this time frame <b>with regard to matters of ritual purity.</b>
The Gemara expresses surprise at this last clause: <b>Isn’t it the opposite [<i>kelapei layya</i>]? We are dealing with matters of purity</b> in this <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means: <b>In the</b> same <b>way that</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> this time frame <b>with regard to matters of ritual purity, so too</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> this time frame <b>in</b> the case of <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation</b> in idol worship.
The Gemara asks: <b>And how long is</b> the <b>period</b> of time referred to in the <i>baraita</i>? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Either</b> the <b>day or</b> the <b>night. Rabbi Ḥana She’ona, and some say Rabbi Ḥana bar She’ona, say</b> that <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Half a day and half a night.</b>
<b>And Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak said: And</b> the Sages <b>do not disagree.</b> The ruling of <b>this</b> one, who says either a day or a night, is stated <b>with regard to</b> the equinox of the <b>season of Nisan or Tishrei,</b> when the days and night are equal; whereas the ruling of <b>that</b> one, who says half a day and half a night, is stated <b>with regard to</b> the solstice of the <b>season of Tammuz,</b> i.e., summer, <b>or Tevet,</b> i.e., winter, which have the longest day or night respectively, so that half the day and half the night together amount to twelve hours. This <i>baraita</i> apparently contradicts the statement of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, who says that the woman may attribute the blood to her hymen for a night and half the day.
The Gemara answers: <b>Here too,</b> one can <b>say with regard to a menstruating woman</b> that he meant <b>half a day and half a night.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty. <b>But</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel <b>said a night and half a day.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>Rather,</b> this is what Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel meant: <b>Either a night during Nisan or Tishrei,</b> which is twelve hours, <b>or half a day and half a night during Tevet or Tammuz,</b> which also equals twelve hours.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: With regard to the purity of wine, a period is twelve hours. But in the case of marriage the time frame <b>is different,</b> due to the <b>marriage contract,</b> which is signed before the marriage is consummated, <b>as</b> there are those <b>who delay for a lengthy</b> period <b>until they</b> complete and <b>sign it.</b> Consequently, the Sages extended the period in this case to a night and half a day.
§ Although the mishna provides a certain period of time for both a minor and a young woman during which they may attribute any blood to the torn hymen, nevertheless <b>Rav and Shmuel both say</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that the groom <b>engages in relations</b> that consummate a marriage, which are <b>a mitzva, and</b> then he <b>separates</b> from his wife.
<b>Rav Ḥisda raises an objection</b> from the <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident</b> involving a virgin who married, <b>and Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>gave her four nights</b> to engage in intercourse <b>within twelve months</b> of her wedding. This indicates that the husband does not have to separate from his wife immediately after the first act of intercourse is completed.
<b>Rava said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>to search for a refutation</b> from a <i>baraita</i>, which is not necessarily known by all? One can <b>raise a difficulty from</b> an explicit statement of <b>the mishna,</b> which states that the first blood a woman sees on her wedding night is attributed to her torn hymen. The Gemara explains that Rav Ḥisda raises his objection from the <i>baraita</i>, as he <b>holds</b> that a practical <b>incident</b> ruled upon by <b>a Sage</b> is a preferable source.
The Gemara returns to the objection: <b>In any case,</b> this <i>baraita</i> is <b>difficult for Rav and Shmuel.</b> The Gemara answers that <b>they acted in accordance with</b> the opinion attributed to <b>our Sages, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Our Sages returned and were counted</b> again, i.e., they voted and decided, that the groom <b>engages in relations</b> that consummate a marriage, which are <b>a mitzva, and</b> subsequently he <b>separates</b> from his wife.
The Gemara proves that this ruling of Rav and Shmuel, based on the <i>baraita</i>, is also the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish. <b>Ulla said: When we were</b> learning the topic <b>of a young girl</b> who saw blood on her wedding night with <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, they brought up from it only</b> the amount <b>of</b> earth <b>that the fox brings up from a plowed field,</b> i.e., they did not establish the <i>halakha</i> as stated in the mishna. <b>And they concluded</b> the discussion in <b>this</b> manner: The groom <b>engages in relations</b> that consummate a marriage, which are <b>a mitzva, and</b> then he <b>separates</b> from his wife.
<b>Rabbi Abba said to Rav Ashi,</b> in light of this ruling that the groom must separate from his bride after completing the act of intercourse: <b>If that is so, a pious person</b> should <b>not complete his</b> act of <b>intercourse,</b> lest he unintentionally continue longer than is permitted. Rav Ashi <b>said to him</b> in reply: The Sages did not issue such a decree, because <b>if so, his heart will strike him</b> with fear that perhaps his wife will begin to bleed while he is engaged in the act of intercourse, <b>and he will separate</b> from his wife completely and will not consummate the marriage.
§ The mishna teaches that a young girl is given four nights during which any bleeding is attributed to her torn hymen. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of them,</b> i.e., all the women who are given four nights, <b>if they were discharging blood continually, from four nights</b> until <b>after</b> those <b>four nights,</b> or in the case of those women who are given only one night, if they discharge blood <b>from that</b> one <b>night</b> until <b>after that night,</b> they may not attribute the blood to the torn hymen. Rather, <b>all of them must examine themselves,</b> in the manner that will be explained.
<b>And with regard to all of</b> these women, <b>Rabbi Meir is stringent in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai,</b> and therefore a minor girl who bleeds for more than four nights must examine herself, despite the fact that Beit Hillel say she remains ritually pure until the wound has healed. Similarly, Rabbi Meir holds that with regard to a young girl who has reached puberty, if she continues to bleed after the first night she must examine herself.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>But</b> with regard to the <b>other</b> cases of <b>seeing</b> blood, when she does not discharge blood continuously but bleeds again the following day, concerning <b>which</b> there is a dispute <b>between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel,</b> Rabbi Meir holds that one <b>follows the appearance of the blood.</b> In other words, he does not maintain entirely in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai. Beit Hillel rule that the woman is ritually pure even if the color of the blood has changed, whereas Beit Shammai hold that she is ritually impure even if the color of the blood has not changed.
<b>As Rabbi Meir would say: The appearances of</b> impure and pure <b>blood differ from one another. How so?</b> The <b>blood of a menstruating woman is red,</b> whereas <b>blood</b> that comes from a torn hymen, indicating that she was <b>a virgin, is not red.</b> The <b>blood of a menstruating woman is cloudy; blood</b> that indicates that she was <b>a virgin is not cloudy.</b> Finally, the <b>blood of a menstruating woman comes from the uterus; blood</b> that indicates that she was <b>a virgin comes from the sides</b> of the vaginal wall.
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Rabbi Yosei says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This is the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> According to Rabbi Meir, it is possible to examine the color of blood to determine whether it is menstrual blood or hymenal blood. <b>But the Rabbis say</b> that <b>all appearances of blood are one,</b> i.e., there is no distinction between the appearance of menstrual blood and blood indicating one’s loss of virginity.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A woman <b>who sees blood due to sexual intercourse may engage in intercourse</b> before the <b>first time</b> this occurs, before the <b>second</b> time this occurs, <b>and</b> before the <b>third</b> time this occurs. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward,</b> i.e., after three consecutive occurrences of bleeding due to intercourse, <b>she may not engage in intercourse until she is divorced</b> from her husband

Daf 66a

<b>and is married to another</b> man. She is permitted to engage in intercourse with her second husband because it is possible that the bleeding was caused by engaging in intercourse with her first husband, and the issue will not reoccur when she engages in intercourse with a different man.
If <b>she married another</b> man <b>and</b> again <b>saw blood due to sexual intercourse, she may engage in intercourse</b> before the <b>first time</b> this occurs, before the <b>second</b> time this occurs, <b>and</b> before the <b>third</b> time this occurs. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward she may not engage in intercourse until she is divorced</b> from her second husband <b>and is married to</b> yet <b>another</b> man. If <b>she married another</b> man <b>and</b> again <b>saw blood due to sexual intercourse, she may engage in intercourse</b> the <b>first time</b> this occurs, the <b>second</b> time this occurs, <b>and</b> the <b>third</b> time this occurs. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward</b> there is a presumption that she always bleeds due to engaging in intercourse, and therefore <b>she may not engage in intercourse</b> or marry someone else <b>until she examines herself.</b>
<b>How</b> does <b>she examine herself? She brings a tube, inside of which</b> she places a cosmetic <b>brush</b> so that it is long enough to reach deeply into her vagina, <b>and</b> an absorbent <b>cloth is placed on the tip</b> of the brush. She inserts the tube with the brush and cloth within herself and then removes it. <b>If blood is found on the top of the</b> absorbent <b>cloth, it is known that</b> the blood <b>comes from the uterus</b> and she is ritually impure. If <b>blood is not found on the top</b> of the cloth, <b>it is known that</b> the blood <b>comes from the sides</b> of the vaginal walls and she is ritually pure, and she may resume engaging in intercourse with her husband.
<b>And if she has a wound in that place,</b> i.e., her vagina, <b>she attributes</b> the blood <b>to her wound,</b> and she is ritually pure, as it is assumed to not be uterine blood. <b>And if she has a</b> fixed menstrual <b>cycle,</b> i.e., she does not bleed every time she engages in intercourse with her husband, but only at fixed times, <b>she attributes</b> the blood <b>to her</b> fixed menstrual <b>cycle,</b> and she is permitted to engage in intercourse at other times.
<b>And if the blood of her wound differed from the blood that she sees</b> due to sexual intercourse, <b>she may not attribute</b> the blood to her wound. <b>And a woman is deemed credible to say: I have a wound in</b> my <b>uterus, from where</b> the <b>blood is emerging.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Blood of a wound that comes from the uterus is ritually impure</b> as a primary category of impurity. Although this blood does not render it prohibited for her to engage in intercourse with her husband, it does render her impure with regard to eating ritually pure food. <b>But our Sages testified</b> that they had a tradition <b>with regard to</b> the <b>blood of a wound that comes from the uterus, that it is ritually pure.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between</b> the opinion of those Sages and the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel? <b>Ulla said:</b> The difference <b>between them is</b> whether the <b>place of</b> a woman’s <b>uterus is impure,</b> which means that any blood that passes through there is impure, even if it is blood from a wound. According to Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, even the blood of a wound becomes impure if it passes through the uterus, whereas those Sages hold that only blood that originates in the uterus is impure.
With regard to the <i>baraita</i> that states that the test for a woman who experiences bleeding due to sexual intercourse is to insert <b>a tube,</b> the Gemara asks: But won’t a tube <b>scratch her</b> and cause her to bleed regardless? <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a tube of lead, and the mouth,</b> i.e., the end that is inserted, <b>is folded inward</b> so that it will not scratch her.
The <i>baraita</i> says that if a woman experiences bleeding on three occasions due to intercourse with her husband he must divorce her. <b>Reish Lakish said to Rabbi Yoḥanan: But let her examine herself after the third</b> act of <b>intercourse with her first husband,</b> so that he need not divorce her. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> It is preferable for her not to test herself and risk becoming forbidden to all men and instead to be divorced and remarry another, <b>because not all fingers,</b> i.e., penises, <b>are equal.</b> Since it is possible that sexual intercourse with her second husband might not cause her to bleed, she should not risk becoming forbidden to all men by performing the examination.
Reish Lakish further <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: Why does she examine herself only after the third time she experiences bleeding due to sexual intercourse with her third husband? <b>But let her examine herself after the first</b> act of <b>intercourse with her third husband.</b> After the first occurrence this woman already has a presumptive status that all acts of intercourse cause her to bleed. Rabbi Yoḥanan answered: She does not perform the examination then, <b>because not all forces are equal.</b> It is possible that the manner in which the couple has intercourse causes her to bleed, and therefore it is only after three times that she has a presumptive status of bleeding after every act of intercourse.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> woman who experienced bleeding due to sexual intercourse <b>who came before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi and asked him what she should do. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to</b> the Sage <b>Abdon,</b> who was present at the time: <b>Go</b> and suddenly <b>frighten</b> this woman. Abdon <b>went</b> and <b>frightened her, and a mass</b> of congealed <b>blood fell from her</b> vagina. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: This</b> woman is now <b>cured.</b> She will no longer experience bleeding due to sexual intercourse, as this mass of blood was the source of the blood.
The Gemara relates a similar incident: There was <b>a certain</b> woman who experienced bleeding due to sexual intercourse <b>who came before Shmuel.</b> Shmuel <b>said to Rav Dimi bar Yosef: Go</b> and <b>frighten</b> this woman. Rav Dimi <b>went</b> and <b>frightened her, but nothing fell from her at all. Shmuel said: This</b> woman <b>is filled</b> with blood, <b>which falls</b> out of her during intercourse. <b>And any</b> woman who <b>is filled</b> with blood <b>that falls</b> out during intercourse <b>has no cure.</b>
The Gemara relates another incident: There was <b>a certain</b> woman <b>who came before Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> and told him <b>that every time she emerged from immersion</b> in a ritual bath, after completing the <b>mitzva</b> of purifying herself for her husband, <b>she would see blood</b> before she engaged in intercourse with him. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to her: Perhaps the gossip</b> of the women <b>in your city,</b> who are jealous of the love between you and your husband, <b>has reached you,</b> and this evil eye causes you to bleed before you engage in intercourse. <b>Go and</b> immerse in the river and <b>engage in intercourse with</b> your husband <b>on the bank of the river,</b> so that the other women will not see you leaving the ritual bath and gossip about you.
<b>Some say</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to her: Reveal</b> this fact <b>to your friends, so that</b> those women <b>who were</b> against <b>you on this side,</b> and gossiped about you, <b>will be</b> with <b>you on that side,</b> and be kind to you. <b>And some say</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to her: Reveal</b> this fact <b>to your friends, in order that they will pray for mercy for you, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> discussing the verse: “And the leper in whom the mark is, his clothes shall be ripped and the hair of his head shall grow long and he will put a covering upon his upper lip <b>and will cry: Impure, impure”</b> (Leviticus 13:45). The leper publicizes the fact that he is ritually impure, as he <b>must announce his pain to the masses, and</b> then <b>the masses will pray for mercy on his</b> behalf.
<b>Rav Yosef said: There was</b> a similar <b>incident in Pumbedita</b> of a woman who experienced bleeding immediately after immersing in a ritual bath, and she followed the advice given by Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>and she was cured.</b>
§ <b>Rav Yosef says</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>decreed</b> that <b>in the fields,</b> i.e., in those distant places where there were no Torah scholars and whose residents were not well versed in the <i>halakhot</i> of menstruating women and did not know how to distinguish between the days of menstruation and the days of <i>ziva</i>, if <b>she saw</b> blood on <b>one day, she must sit</b> and count <b>six</b> days <b>and that</b> first day. She must observe six clean days without a discharge despite the possibility that she might have experienced bleeding only in her period of <i>ziva</i>, in which case she would be impure for only one day.
If she experiences bleeding for <b>two</b> days, <b>she must sit</b> and count <b>six</b> days <b>and</b> both of <b>those</b> first two days, for a total of eight days, in case the first day on which she bled was the last day of <i>ziva</i>, while the next day was the first day of her menstruation period. If she experiences bleeding for <b>three</b> days <b>she must sit</b> and count <b>seven clean</b> days, as she might be a greater <i>zava</i>, who must count seven clean days.
The Gemara cites a related statement. <b>Rabbi Zeira says: Jewish women were stringent with themselves</b> to the extent <b>that even if they see a drop of blood</b> the size <b>of a mustard</b> seed, they <b>sit seven clean</b> days <b>for it.</b> By Torah law, a woman who experiences menstrual bleeding waits seven days in total before immersing, regardless of whether she experienced bleeding on those days. If she experiences bleeding during the eleven days when she is not expected to experience menstrual bleeding, she is a lesser <i>zava</i> and waits one day without bleeding and then immerses. The Jewish women accepted upon themselves the stringency that if they experience any bleeding whatsoever, they treat it as the blood of a greater <i>zava</i>, which obligates one to count seven clean days before immersing (see Leviticus 15:25).
<b>Rava authorized Rav Shmuel, and he taught:</b> If a pregnant woman experienced <b>labor pains</b> for <b>two days, and on the third</b> day <b>she miscarried, she must sit</b> and count <b>seven clean</b> days. The Gemara explains that Rava <b>holds</b> that the principle that blood that emerges while the woman experiences <b>labor pains</b> is not ritually impure does <b>not</b> apply <b>to miscarriages. And</b> Rava further maintains that <b>it is impossible for the womb to open without blood</b> emerging. Therefore, when she miscarried she must have experienced a flow of blood, even if she did not notice it.
<b>Rav Pappa said to Rava:</b> For <b>what</b> reason did you teach this <i>halakha</i> <b>specifically</b> with regard to a woman who experiences <b>labor pains</b> for <b>two days? Even</b> if she <b>merely</b> discharges <b>any amount</b> of blood she should be impure, <b>as Rabbi Zeira says: The Jewish women were stringent with themselves</b> to the extent <b>that even if they see a drop of blood of</b> the size of <b>a mustard</b> seed, that woman <b>sits seven clean</b> days <b>for it.</b> Since it is impossible for the womb to open without the emergence of blood, when this woman miscarried there must have been blood, and therefore she must count seven clean days.
Rava <b>said to</b> Rav Pappa: <b>I speak to you</b> of <b>a prohibition,</b> i.e., that by Torah law a woman who experiences difficulty in childbirth for two days and on the third miscarries must count seven clean days as a greater <i>zava</i>, <b>and you speak to me</b> of <b>a custom,</b> a mere stringency. The stringency you mention does not apply in this case. <b>Where</b> the Jewish women <b>were stringent, they were stringent,</b> i.e., if they saw a drop of blood the size of a mustard seed. <b>Where they were not stringent,</b> i.e., in a case of blood due to labor, <b>they were not stringent.</b> By contrast, in the case I described the woman is obligated to count seven clean days by Torah law.
The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the following discussions: <b>One who proposed to her; natron; with hot</b> water; <b>to immerse; folds; on top of; a port. Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>one who proposed marriage to</b> a woman <b>and she accepted it,</b> the emotional excitement might have caused her to have a flow of menstrual blood, which would render her ritually impure and prohibit her from engaging in intercourse. Even if she was unaware of any flow, she must consider the possibility that it occurred. Therefore, to purify herself <b>she must wait seven</b> consecutive days that are <b>clean</b> from any flow of menstrual blood and then immerse in a ritual bath. Only after that process may she marry.
The Gemara cites a related incident: <b>Ravina arranged for his son</b> to marry into <b>the family of Rav Ḥanina,</b> i.e., to marry Rav Ḥanina’s daughter. Rav Ḥanina <b>said to</b> Ravina: <b>Does the Master hold</b> that it is appropriate <b>to write the marriage contract</b> as stating that the wedding will take place <b>in four days,</b> i.e., on Wednesday? Ravina <b>said: Yes. When</b> the <b>fourth</b> day, i.e., Wednesday <b>arrived, he waited until another fourth</b> day before marrying her, until the following Wednesday, i.e., <b>he delayed seven days after that day</b> when he had planned to marry her.
Rav Ḥanina <b>said to</b> Ravina: <b>What is this?</b> Why did you delay the wedding by an extra week? Ravina <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥanina: <b>Doesn’t the Master hold in accordance with this</b> statement <b>of Rava, as Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>one who proposed marriage to</b> a woman <b>and she accepted it, she must wait seven</b> consecutive days that are <b>clean</b> from any flow of menstrual blood and then immerse in a ritual bath? Rav Ḥanina <b>said to</b> Ravina: One can <b>say that Rava said</b> this statement <b>with regard to an adult woman, who has seen</b> menstrual <b>blood. But did</b> Rava actually <b>say</b> this <b>with regard to a minor girl, who has not</b> yet <b>seen</b> menstrual <b>blood?</b>
Ravina <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥanina: <b>Rava said explicitly</b> that there is <b>no difference</b> whether she is <b>an adult woman</b> and <b>no difference</b> whether she is <b>a minor girl. What is the reason</b> that <b>an adult woman</b> must wait for seven days? She must wait <b>because she desires</b> to marry her husband, and this might cause her to have a flow of blood. <b>A minor girl also desires</b> to marry her husband, which could cause a flow of blood.
§ <b>Rava says: A woman</b> who is about to immerse herself in a ritual bath for purification

Daf 66b

<b>may not wash</b> her hair <b>with natron or with sand.</b> The reason she may not wash her hair <b>with natron</b> is <b>because</b> natron <b>pulls out</b> hair, and that hair may remain sitting on her head and serve as an interposition between her and the water of the ritual bath. <b>And</b> similarly, she may not wash her hair <b>with sand, because it sticks</b> to her hair and it also serves as an interposition.
<b>And Ameimar said in the name of Rava: A woman washes</b> her hair <b>only with hot</b> water, <b>but not with cold</b> water. <b>But</b> she may wash her hair <b>even with hot</b> water that was heated in the <b>sun. What is the reason</b> that she may <b>not</b> wash her hair with <b>cold</b> water? <b>Because it is cold and</b> causes the <b>hair to harden,</b> and the dirt will remain in the hair.
<b>And Rava says: A man should always teach in his house that a woman should rinse any place with creases,</b> e.g., her armpits, <b>in water</b> before she immerses in a ritual bath, to ensure that they are clean. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Places with creases and</b> any <b>concealed part</b> of the body <b>do not require immersion in water.</b> In other words, the immersion is valid even if the water does not touch those parts of the body. If so, why must she rinse them before immersing?
The Gemara answers: <b>Granted that they do not require immersion in water,</b> but <b>we require</b> that they must be <b>a place that is suitable for immersion in water.</b> This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Zeira, as Rabbi Zeira says:</b> For <b>any</b> amount of flour <b>suitable for mingling</b> with oil in a meal offering, <b>mingling is not indispensable for it,</b> i.e., it is valid even if it is not mixed. <b>But</b> for <b>any</b> amount of flour <b>not suitable for mingling,</b> e.g., if the quantity of flour is so great that the ingredients cannot be properly mixed, <b>mingling is indispensable for it,</b> and such a meal offering is invalid. This teaches a halakhic principle: There are certain actions that prevent the fulfillment of a mitzva if they are impossible, even if the actual performance of those actions are not indispensable to the mitzva.
<b>Ravin bar Rav Adda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> There was <b>an incident involving a maidservant of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>who immersed</b> herself, <b>and she ascended</b> from her immersion <b>and a bone was found interposed between her teeth, and Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>required her</b> to perform <b>another immersion.</b> This demonstrates that according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi one may not have a foreign object even inside one’s mouth.
<b>And Rava says:</b> If a woman <b>immersed</b> in a ritual bath <b>and ascended</b> from the water, <b>and</b> she then <b>found on her</b> hair <b>an item that interposes</b> between her and the water, what is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>If she immersed soon</b> after <b>washing</b> her hair, <b>she does not need to wash</b> her hair <b>and immerse</b> in the ritual bath a second time, as it can be assumed that this item was not there when she immersed, since her hair had been cleaned. <b>But if</b> she did <b>not</b> wash her hair immediately before immersing, <b>she must wash</b> her hair <b>and immerse</b> in the ritual bath a second time.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who state</b> a slightly different version of Rava’s statement: <b>If she immersed on the same day that she washed</b> her hair, <b>she does not need to wash</b> her hair <b>and to immerse</b> in a ritual bath a second time. <b>But if</b> she did <b>not</b> wash her hair on the same day that she immersed, <b>she must wash</b> her hair <b>and immerse</b> in the ritual bath a second time.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the practical difference <b>between</b> these two versions of Rava’s statement? The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between them</b> is <b>with regard to washing</b> her hair <b>close to immersion.</b> According to the first version of Rava’s statement, she must wash her hair immediately before immersing, whereas according to the second version she has more time. Another difference between the two versions is <b>with regard to washing</b> her hair <b>during the day and immersing at night</b> immediately afterward. According to the first version of Rava’s statement, provided that she washed her hair immediately before immersing, it makes no difference whether or not she washed and immersed on the same day. Conversely, according to the second version she must wash her hair on the same day or night as her immersion.
§ <b>Rava says: A woman may not stand on top of earthenware utensils</b> that are submerged in the ritual bath <b>and immerse. Rav Kahana thought to say: What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>because</b> the Sages issued <b>a decree</b> against immersing in this manner, as it appears like immersing in <b>bathhouses,</b> i.e., the purpose of the decree is to prevent women from thinking that it is permitted to immerse in a bathhouse, which contains drawn water and is not valid as a ritual bath. It can be inferred from this reasoning that it is <b>permitted</b> for a woman to stand <b>on top of a plank of wood</b> that is in the ritual bath.
<b>Rav Ḥanan from Neharde’a said to</b> Rav Kahana that this is not the reason for Rava’s statement. Rather, <b>there,</b> in the case of submerged earthenware utensils, <b>what is the reason</b> that she may not immerse? She may not immerse <b>because she</b> will be <b>afraid</b> that she might fall off, and consequently she will not immerse herself properly. By the same logic, <b>she</b> will <b>also</b> be <b>afraid</b> when she is standing on top of <b>a plank of wood,</b> and therefore this is also prohibited.
<b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says: A woman may not immerse</b> herself

Daf 67a

<b>in a port [<i>banamal</i>],</b> where the boats are drawn up onto shore, as there is a lot of mud there, which can stick to her and interpose between her and the water. <b>Even though now,</b> after the immersion, <b>there is no</b> mud stuck to her feet or body, one can <b>say</b> that perhaps <b>while she walked</b> back after immersing the mud <b>fell</b> off. Since one cannot be certain that there was no mud stuck to her body while she immersed, she may not immerse in a port.
The Gemara relates that <b>Shmuel’s father prepared ritual baths for his daughters in the days of Nisan,</b> by digging holes and letting them fill with natural rainwater, <b>and</b> he placed <b>mats</b> in the Euphrates River <b>in the days of Tishrei.</b> Since the water was shallow and the riverbed was muddy, he placed mats on the riverbed so that they could immerse without getting dirty.
The Gemara cites a similar <i>halakha</i> involving the interposition of an item during immersion. <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If a woman <b>gave a cooked</b> dish <b>to her son, and</b> afterward she <b>immersed</b> in a ritual bath <b>and ascended</b> from the ritual bath, the <b>immersion is ineffective for her.</b> The reason is that <b>even though now,</b> after the immersion, <b>there is no</b> food stuck to her body, one can <b>say</b> that perhaps <b>as she walked</b> back after immersing the food <b>fell</b> off. Since one cannot be certain that there was no food stuck to her body while she immersed, she should not handle food immediately before immersing.
<b>Rami bar Abba said:</b> With regard to <b>these bloodletting incisions [<i>ravdei dekhusilta</i>], until three days</b> have passed since the bloodletting, when they have not yet formed a hard scab, they do <b>not interpose</b> and invalidate an immersion. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward they interpose,</b> as the scab is too hard for the water to penetrate.
<b>Mar Ukva said:</b> With regard to <b>mucus that is in the eye,</b> if it is <b>moist, it does not interpose</b> and invalidate an immersion. But if the mucus is <b>dry</b> and hard <b>it interposes. When is it called dry?</b> It is called dry <b>from the time that it begins to turn yellow.</b>
<b>Shmuel says: Eye shadow that is in the eye does not interpose</b> and invalidate an immersion. <b>But</b> eye shadow <b>that is on</b> or around <b>the eye interposes.</b> And <b>if</b> the woman’s <b>eyes were</b> constantly <b>blinking,</b> then <b>even</b> eye shadow <b>that is on</b> or around <b>the eye does not interpose,</b> as the constant blinking removes the eye shadow.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If a woman <b>opened her eyes very</b> wide <b>or closed her eyes very</b> tightly while immersing, this <b>immersion is ineffective for her.</b> Such open or closed eyelids prevent the water from reaching the creases around the eyes.
<b>Reish Lakish says: A woman may immerse</b> herself in a ritual bath <b>only in the manner that she grows,</b> i.e., she may not force her arms to her sides or close her legs tightly. She is not obligated to spread her limbs widely, but simply stand in her normal manner. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 2:4): When <b>a man</b> has a leprous mark between his legs and stands before a priest for inspection, he should <b>appear like</b> one who is <b>hoeing,</b> i.e., with his legs slightly apart, <b>and</b> if it is under his arm, he should appear like one who is <b>harvesting olives,</b> with his arms slightly raised. If the mark is not visible when he is standing in that manner, it is not impure. By contrast, <b>a woman</b> with a leprous mark between her legs should <b>appear like</b> one who is <b>weaving, and</b> if the mark is beneath her breast she should appear <b>like</b> a woman who is <b>nursing her son.</b>
<b>Rabba bar Rav Huna says: A single hair tied</b> in a knot <b>interposes</b> and invalidates an immersion.

Daf 67b

<b>Three</b> hairs tied together in a knot <b>do not interpose,</b> as three hairs cannot be tied so tightly that water cannot penetrate them. With regard to <b>two</b> hairs tied together in a knot, <b>I do not know</b> the <i>halakha</i>. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: We have</b> a tradition that <b>only one</b> hair interposes, but two or more do not prevent the water from reaching the body.
§ <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: By Torah law,</b> if there is an interposition between a person and the water, and it covers <b>the majority of his</b> body, and <b>he is particular</b> and wants the interposing substance removed, <b>it interposes</b> and invalidates an immersion in a ritual bath. But if it covers the <b>majority of his</b> body <b>but he is not particular about</b> that substance, <b>it does not interpose. But</b> the Sages <b>issued a decree</b> prohibiting substances covering <b>the majority</b> of <b>his</b> body with regard to <b>which he is not particular, due to</b> substances covering <b>the majority</b> of <b>his</b> body about <b>which he is particular. And</b> likewise, they issued a decree against substances covering <b>the minority</b> of <b>his</b> body with regard to which he is <b>particular, due to</b> substances covering <b>the majority</b> of <b>his</b> body about which he is <b>particular.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But let them also issue a decree</b> prohibiting substances covering <b>the minority</b> of <b>his</b> body with regard to <b>which he is not particular, due to</b> substances covering <b>the minority</b> of <b>his</b> body about which he is <b>particular.</b> The Gemara answers: The Sages did not issue such a decree, as that prohibition <b>is itself</b> a rabbinic <b>decree, and will we arise and issue a decree to</b> prevent the violation of another <b>decree?</b>
§ The Gemara returns to discuss the issue of the correct time for immersion. <b>Rav says: A menstruating woman</b> who wishes to immerse to complete her purification process <b>at her time,</b> i.e., at the end of seven days, <b>may immerse only at night,</b> i.e., on the night after the seventh day, the night of the eighth day. <b>But</b> a woman who wishes to immerse <b>not at her time,</b> i.e., on the eighth day or afterward, <b>may immerse either during the day or at night. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Whether</b> she is immersing <b>at her time or not at her time,</b> she <b>may immerse only at night.</b> This is <b>because her daughter</b> might <b>follow</b> her example when she is old enough, and also immerse in the daytime, but she may do so on the seventh day, when immersion is not valid.
<b>And even Rav retracted</b> his opinion and ruled that a woman who is immersing after menstruation may never do so during the day. <b>As Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ashi said</b> that <b>Rav said: A menstruating woman</b> who wishes to immerse to complete her purification process, <b>whether at her time</b> or <b>whether not at her time, may immerse only at night, because her daughter</b> might <b>follow</b> her example and immerse during the daytime of the seventh day.
The Gemara cites examples of Sages who permitted immersion on the eighth day due to exceptional circumstances. <b>Rav Idi decreed in Neresh that</b> the women <b>may immerse</b> during the daytime <b>on the eighth day due to the lions</b> that roamed the area at night and posed a threat to women who immersed at that time. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov</b> decreed <b>in Pappunya</b> that the women should immerse during the daytime on the eighth day <b>due to thieves</b> who posed a threat to women who immersed at that night.
Similarly, <b>Rav Yehuda</b> decreed <b>in Pumbedita</b> that the women should immerse in the daytime on the eighth day <b>due to</b> the <b>cold</b> of the night. <b>Rava</b> decreed <b>in Meḥoza</b> that the women should immerse in the daytime on the eighth day <b>due to</b> the <b>gatekeepers [<i>abula’ei</i>],</b> who were untrustworthy and might hurt the women on their way to and from immersion.
§ <b>Rav Pappa said to Rava and to Abaye: Since nowadays the Sages have given</b> all women who menstruate the status of <b>an uncertain</b> greater <b><i>zava</i>, may they immerse on the seventh day</b> during the daytime? A greater <i>zava</i>, after counting seven clean days, may immerse on the seventh day. Since all women who menstruate now count seven clean days after the bleeding ceases, more than seven days from the onset of her menstruating have passed by the seventh clean day.
Rava and Abaye replied that they may nevertheless not immerse on the seventh day, <b>due to</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Shimon. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “But if she be purified of her <i>ziva</i>, then she shall count to herself seven days, <b>and after that she shall be pure”</b> (Leviticus 15:28). The purification of a <i>zava</i> must be <b>after</b> the seven days, i.e., <b>after all of the</b> days, which must be consecutive so <b>that there are no</b> days of <b>impurity separating between</b> the seven clean days. <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that the phrase <b>“And after that she shall be pure”</b> teaches that <b>after the action</b> of counting seven clean days <b>she shall be pure.</b> In other words, once she has examined herself at the beginning of the seventh day she may immerse on that day.
Rabbi Shimon continues: <b>But the Sages said: It is prohibited to do so,</b> i.e., to immerse on the seventh day, <b>lest she come to</b> a case of <b>uncertainty.</b> If she were to engage in intercourse with her husband on that seventh day after immersion, and afterward on the same day she experiences bleeding, it would retroactively nullify her entire seven clean days, which would mean that she engaged in intercourse with her husband while she was impure, rendering them both liable to receive the punishment of <i>karet</i>.
§ <b>Rav Huna says: A woman may wash</b> her hair <b>on the first</b> day <b>of the week,</b> Sunday, <b>and immerse on the third</b> day <b>of the week,</b> i.e., Monday night. The proof of this is <b>that</b> sometimes <b>a woman washes</b> her hair <b>on the eve of Shabbat, but</b> she does not <b>immerse</b> until <b>the conclusion of Shabbat,</b> which is the same interval as from Sunday to Monday night.
Similarly, <b>a woman may wash</b> her hair <b>on the first</b> day <b>of the week,</b> Sunday, <b>and immerse on the fourth</b> day <b>of the week,</b> Tuesday night. The proof of this is <b>that</b> sometimes <b>a woman washes</b> her hair <b>on the eve of Shabbat, but</b> she does not <b>immerse</b> until <b>the conclusion of the Festival that occurs after Shabbat,</b> which is the same interval as from Sunday to Tuesday night.
Furthermore, <b>a woman may wash</b> her hair <b>on the first</b> day <b>of the week,</b> Sunday, <b>and immerse on the fifth</b> day <b>of the week,</b> Wednesday night. The proof of this is <b>that</b> sometimes <b>a woman washes</b> her hair <b>on the eve of Shabbat, but</b> she does not <b>immerse</b> until <b>the conclusion of two days of Rosh HaShana that occurs after Shabbat,</b> which is the same interval as from Sunday to Wednesday night.
<b>But Rav Ḥisda said: We say</b> that <b>all of these</b> long gaps between a woman washing her hair and immersing are permitted. But <b>we do not say</b> as proof <b>that</b> since a woman washes her hair before Shabbat and immerses only several days later, she may do so during a regular week as well. One cannot learn this <i>halakha</i> from those situations involving Shabbat, as one cannot derive cases where alternatives are possible from those cases where alternatives are not possible. <b>Where it is possible</b> for a woman to wash her hair and immerse immediately, <b>it is possible,</b> and she is not allowed to do so any earlier. But <b>where it is not possible</b> for a woman to wash her hair immediately before immersion, e.g., when she must immerse after the conclusion of Shabbat or a festival, <b>it is impossible,</b> and for this reason she is permitted to wash her hair in advance.
<b>And Rav Yeimar said: We even say</b> the proof <b>that</b> since a woman washes her hair before Shabbat and immerses only several days later, she may do so during a regular week as well. Rav Yeimar agrees with Rav Huna in all cases <b>apart from</b> that of <b>a woman who washes</b> her hair <b>on the first</b> day <b>of the week,</b> Sunday, <b>and immerses on the fifth</b> day <b>of the week,</b> Wednesday night. He maintains that Rav Huna’s proof <b>from the conclusion of two days of Rosh HaShana that is after Shabbat is not</b> a sufficient proof, <b>as</b> even in such a case a woman may not wait so long. Rather, <b>it is possible</b> for her <b>to wash</b> her hair <b>at night</b> after the conclusion of Rosh HaShana <b>and immerse</b> on <b>that</b> same <b>night,</b> so that she should not have such a long gap between washing her hair and immersing.
<b>Mareimar taught: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> that a woman should not wash her hair many days before immersing except when there is no other possibility. <b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> is also <b>in accordance with</b> the manner in <b>which Rav Yeimar explains</b> that if Rosh HaShana occurs after Shabbat a woman should wash her hair on the night of her immersion.
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether <b>a woman may wash</b> her hair <b>at night and immerse on</b> that same <b>night? Mar Zutra deems it prohibited</b> for her to do so. Since she will be in a hurry to immerse and return to her husband, there is a concern that she will not wash and examine her hair thoroughly. <b>And Rav Ḥinnana from Sura deems it permitted</b> for a woman to wash her hair on the night of her immersion.
<b>Rav Adda said to Rav Ḥinnana from Sura: Was</b> there <b>not an incident</b> like <b>this involving the wife of Abba Mari, the Exilarch, who quarreled</b> with her husband, and as a result she did not want to immerse in a ritual bath to become permitted to him; and <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak went to appease her</b> and to persuade her to immerse, <b>and she said to him: What is there</b> that can be done <b>now?</b> There is no reason for me to hurry and immerse now.

Daf 68a

Rather, <b>it is sufficient if you come</b> back again <b>tomorrow</b> and speak with me then about this matter. <b>And</b> Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak <b>knew what she was saying to him.</b> She was alluding to the fact that she had not washed her hair while it was still daylight, and therefore she could not immerse that evening. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak <b>said</b> to her: <b>Are you lacking kettles [<i>dudei</i>]</b> to heat water to wash your hair? <b>Are you lacking buckets [<i>tashtekei</i>]</b> to bring the water to wash your hair? <b>Are you lacking servants,</b> who can help you prepare to wash your hair? It can be inferred from this story that Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak holds that it is permitted for a woman to wash her hair and immerse on the same night.
§ <b>Rava taught: A woman may wash</b> her hair <b>on the eve of Shabbat and immerse at the conclusion of Shabbat. Rav Pappa said to Rava: But didn’t Ravin send</b> the following <i>halakha</i> <b>in his letter: A woman may not wash</b> her hair <b>on the eve of Shabbat and immerse at the conclusion of Shabbat?</b> Instead, she should wash her hair after the conclusion of Shabbat immediately before she immerses.
<b>And</b> furthermore, you should <b>be astounded with yourself: How</b> did the Sages deem it permitted for a woman on a weekday to <b>wash</b> her hair <b>during the day and immerse at night? Don’t we require</b> that her <b>immersion</b> must be <b>immediately</b> after <b>washing</b> her hair? <b>And</b> if she washes her hair during the day, this requirement will <b>not</b> be fulfilled. The Sages reluctantly permitted a woman to wash her hair during the day, and they permitted this only due to the concern that she might not wash her hair properly if she would wait until night. Consequently, with regard to an immersion on the conclusion of Shabbat, she should avoid washing her hair a day or more in advance.
As a result of Rav Pappa’s comments, <b>Rava then appointed an interpreter before him</b> to publicize his retraction, <b>and</b> he <b>taught: The statement I said to you was a mistake of mine. But</b> in fact <b>this</b> is what the Sages <b>said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: A woman may not wash</b> her hair <b>on the eve of Shabbat and immerse after the conclusion of Shabbat. And</b> furthermore you should <b>be astounded with yourself. How</b> can a woman <b>wash</b> her hair <b>during the day and immerse at night? Don’t we require:</b> Her <b>immersion</b> must be <b>immediately</b> after <b>washing</b> her hair? <b>And</b> if she washes her hair on the eve of Shabbat, this principle will <b>not</b> be fulfilled.
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>a woman may wash</b> her hair <b>during the day and immerse at night. And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>a woman may wash</b> her hair <b>only at night.</b> The Gemara comments: This is <b>difficult,</b> as one <b><i>halakha</i></b> contradicts <b>the</b> other <b><i>halakha</i>.</b>
The Gemara answers: It is <b>not difficult. This</b> ruling that she may wash her hair during the day is referring to a case <b>where it is possible,</b> e.g., when she immerses on a weeknight and can wash her hair shortly beforehand during the daytime. <b>That</b> ruling that she is permitted to wash her hair only at night is referring to a case <b>where it is not possible,</b> e.g., when her time for immersion is after the conclusion of Shabbat. Since she may not wash her hair on the eve of Shabbat for an immersion after the conclusion of Shabbat, she must wash her hair at night, after Shabbat has ended, immediately before she immerses.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>a menstruating woman who examined herself</b> on the <b>seventh day</b> of menstruation in <b>the morning and found</b> that <b>she is ritually pure</b> and eligible to immerse in a ritual bath that evening, <b>but</b> during <b>twilight</b> of the seventh day she <b>did not</b> perform an examination that marks the <b>transition</b> between the days when she has a flow of blood and the days when she no longer has a flow of blood but immersed despite not having performed the examination, <b>and after</b> several <b>days she examined</b> herself and <b>found</b> that <b>she is ritually impure, the presumptive status of that</b> woman is one of <b>ritual purity</b> from the time of her immersion until her examination, and all ritually pure items that she handled in the interim remain pure.
If <b>she examined herself on</b> the <b>seventh day</b> of menstruation in <b>the morning and found</b> that <b>she is ritually impure,</b> i.e., her menstrual flow continued, <b>and</b> during <b>twilight</b> of the seventh day she <b>did not</b> perform an examination to confirm the <b>transition</b> from ritual impurity to ritual purity but immersed nonetheless, <b>and after</b> several <b>days she examined</b> herself and <b>found</b> that <b>she is ritually pure, the presumptive status of that</b> woman is one of <b>ritual impurity</b> from the time of her immersion until her examination, and all ritually pure items that she handled in the interim are impure. Since she found blood during her last examination in her days of menstruation, the concern is that the flow of blood continued during the days that followed, and therefore her immersion on the eve of the eighth day was ineffective.
In a case where there was no blood found during the examination on the seventh morning and she did not examine herself during twilight, and several days later she discovered blood, where the mishna says that a woman’s presumptive status is one of ritual purity, that is the <i>halakha</i> only for the days following immersion. <b>But she transmits ritual impurity</b> to the ritually pure items that she handled before the examination in which she found blood <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period and from examination to examination,</b> in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> of a woman who experiences bleeding (see 2a). <b>And if she has</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle,</b> on the day that she examined herself and found blood, <b>her time is sufficient,</b> i.e., it is assumed that the bleeding began then, and she does not transmit impurity retroactively.
<b>And Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> woman <b>who did not</b> perform the examination marking her <b>transition</b> from ritual impurity to ritual purity on the seventh day <b>from <i>minḥa</i></b> time <b>onward,</b> even if she performed an examination and found no blood that morning, <b>the presumptive status of that</b> woman is one of <b>ritual impurity. And the Rabbis say: Even</b> if <b>on the second</b> day <b>of her menstruation she performed the examination and found</b> that <b>she is ritually pure, and</b> she <b>did not</b> perform the examination marking her <b>transition</b> from ritual impurity to ritual purity on the seventh day <b>during twilight, and after</b> several <b>days she examined</b> herself <b>and found</b> that <b>she is ritually impure, the presumptive status of that</b> woman is one of <b>ritual purity</b> from the time of her immersion until her examination.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara cites a dispute between <i>amora’im</i> with regard to a case where a woman did not perform an examination indicating her transition from ritual impurity to ritual purity, and three days passed in which it is possible that she received the status of a <i>zava</i>, and then she found that she was ritually impure. It <b>was stated</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> This woman is <b>a definite</b> greater <b><i>zava</i>. And Levi says:</b> She is <b>an uncertain</b> greater <b><i>zava</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>To which</b> clause of the mishna does this dispute apply? <b>If we say</b> that Rav and Levi are referring <b>to the first clause,</b> i.e., a woman who examined herself on the morning of the seventh day and found herself to be ritually pure, but she did not examine herself at twilight, and several days later she examined herself and found herself to be impure, this cannot be correct, as the mishna <b>teaches: The presumptive status of that woman</b> is one of <b>ritual purity.</b> She is not a <i>zava</i> at all.
<b>Rather,</b> say that they are referring <b>to the latter clause</b> of the mishna, when she examined herself on the morning of the seventh day and found herself to be ritually impure. If so, <b>granted</b> Levi’s opinion is reasonable, as <b>we say</b> that this woman is <b>an uncertain</b> greater <b><i>zava</i>. But</b> how can one explain Rav’s opinion that she is <b>even a definite</b> greater <b><i>zava</i>?</b> After all, <b>she examined</b> herself <b>and found</b> that <b>she is ritually pure.</b> If so, how can she be a definite <i>zava</i>?
<b>Rather, when</b> the dispute <b>of Rav and Levi was stated,</b> it <b>was stated</b> as <b>a distinct <i>halakha</i></b> unrelated to the mishna, as follows: With regard to <b>a menstruating woman who examined herself on the seventh day</b> in <b>the morning and found</b> that she was <b>ritually impure, and</b> at <b>twilight</b> of the seventh day she <b>did not</b> perform an examination to confirm her <b>transition</b> from ritual impurity to ritual purity, <b>and after</b> several <b>days she examined</b> herself <b>and found</b> that <b>she is ritually impure, Rav says:</b> This woman is <b>a definite</b> greater <b><i>zava</i>. And Levi says:</b> She is <b>an uncertain</b> greater <b><i>zava</i>.</b>
The Gemara explains their opinions. <b>Rav says:</b> This woman is <b>a definite</b> greater <b><i>zava</i>, since from the outset she found</b> herself to be <b>ritually impure, and now she found</b> herself to also be <b>ritually impure.</b> Consequently, she is <b>definitely impure. And Levi says:</b> This woman is <b>an uncertain</b> greater <b><i>zava</i>,</b> as one can <b>say</b> that perhaps <b>she stopped</b> experiencing bleeding <b>in between</b> the morning of her seventh day of menstruation when she first found herself to be impure and several days later, on the second occasion that she found herself to be impure.

Daf 68b

<b>And Levi taught similarly in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> If a woman examined herself on the seventh day of menstruation and found herself to be impure, and she did not perform the examination to confirm her transition from ritual impurity to ritual purity, and <b>after</b> several <b>days</b> she examined herself, <b>whether she examined</b> herself <b>and found</b> herself to be <b>ritually pure</b> or <b>whether she examined</b> herself <b>and found</b> herself to be <b>ritually impure, she is an uncertain</b> greater <b><i>zava</i>.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>But she transmits ritual impurity</b> to the ritually pure items that she handled before the examination in which she found blood <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that it is a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rava, as Rava said,</b> with regard to the statement in the mishna on 38b that a woman has a presumptive status of ritual purity during the eleven days of potential <i>ziva</i>: This serves <b>to say that a woman does not transmit ritual impurity for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> before experiencing bleeding <b>during her days of <i>ziva</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t</b> the Gemara already cite <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rava one time,</b> on 39a? The Gemara explains that <b>this is</b> what <b>we are saying: Let us say that</b> there <b>is a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rava from this</b> mishna <b>as well.</b>
The Gemara responds that <b>Rava</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>when</b> the mishna <b>teaches: She transmits ritual impurity for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period,</b> it is <b>referring to the beginning of our chapter.</b> Specifically, it is speaking <b>of</b> the mishna on 64b, which discusses the case of a young woman who <b>saw</b> menstrual blood before marriage while <b>she was still in her father’s house.</b> According to Beit Hillel she may engage in intercourse only the first night, during which the blood is considered the blood from the torn hymen rather than the blood of menstruation. This mishna is teaching that from that point onward, when she experiences bleeding she renders items impure retroactively for a twenty-four-hour period, like other women.
The Gemara explains that this ruling is necessary, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> her cycle of menstruation and <i>ziva</i> is <b>interrupted</b> by <b>days</b> when any blood she discharges is considered to be <b>ritually pure,</b> she now reverts back as though it is <b>considered like the beginning of her</b> days of <b>menstruation, and she does not transmit ritual impurity</b> retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period.</b> Therefore, this mishna <b>teaches us</b> that she does transmit impurity retroactively.
§ The mishna teaches: And <b>if she has a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle</b> on the day that she examined herself and found blood, her time is sufficient and she does not transmit impurity retroactively. The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that this <b>is a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya,</b> with regard to the ruling he says that <b>Shmuel says? As Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya says</b> that <b>Shmuel says,</b> with regard to the mishna on 38b that teaches that a woman has a presumptive status of ritual purity during the eleven days of potential <i>ziva</i>: This serves <b>to say that a woman does not establish a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle during her days of <i>ziva</i>.</b>
The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya</b> could have <b>said to you: When we say</b> that <b>a woman does not establish</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle during her days of <i>ziva</i>,</b> we meant this only as a leniency, <b>that</b> she does <b>not require three times to uproot</b> any such cycle. Rather, she uproots it after one time when she does not experience bleeding in accordance with that cycle. <b>As we say</b> that <b>her</b> menstrual <b>blood is removed</b> during her days of <i>ziva</i>, and she is unlikely to discharge menstrual blood during that time. <b>And since her blood is removed,</b> if she established a fixed menstrual cycle it <b>is sufficient for her</b> to be deemed impure from the <b>hour</b> that she saw the menstrual flow. There is no decree of retroactive impurity on items that she previously touched due to the concern that the blood flow might have started earlier.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to any woman who did not perform the examination indicating her transition from ritual impurity to ritual purity on the seventh day from <i>minḥa</i> time onward, even if she performed an examination and found no blood that morning, the presumptive status of that woman is one of ritual impurity. It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Yehuda:</b> If the <i>halakha</i> <b>had</b> been that a woman who will immerse must keep her <b>hands placed in her eyes,</b> a euphemism for her vagina, for <b>the entire twilight</b> period, what <b>you say is fine.</b> It would be reasonable to assume that since she did not examine herself at the end of the day she has a presumptive status of ritual impurity.
But <b>now</b> that you say that it is insufficient to examine herself in the morning, what is your reasoning? Evidently, you <b>say</b> that <b>when she removed her hand</b> from examining herself perhaps <b>she saw</b> blood and is impure. If so, <b>what</b> difference is it <b>to me</b> if she performed the examination indicating her <b>transition</b> from ritual impurity <b>to ritual purity on the seventh</b> day <b>from <i>minḥa</i></b> time <b>onward,</b> and <b>what</b> difference is it <b>to me</b> if she performed the examination indicating her <b>transition</b> from ritual impurity <b>to ritual purity on the first</b> day of her counting?
The Gemara asks: Why do the Rabbis mention an examination <b>on the first</b> day of her counting? <b>Is there one who said</b> that if a woman examines herself only on the first day that is sufficient?
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> there is such an opinion, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I asked Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon</b> the following question <b>when they were walking on the road:</b> With regard to <b>a menstruating woman who examined herself</b> on the <b>seventh day</b> in <b>the morning and found</b> herself to be <b>ritually pure, but at twilight</b> she did <b>not</b> perform the examination indicating her <b>transition</b> from ritual impurity to ritual purity, <b>and after</b> several <b>days she examined</b> herself <b>and found</b> herself to be <b>ritually impure, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon <b>said to him: She has a presumptive status of ritual purity</b> up until the moment that she discovered that she was impure. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi asked them additional questions: If she examined herself on the <b>sixth</b> day, or the <b>fifth</b> day, or the <b>fourth</b> day, or the <b>third</b> day, or even the <b>second</b> day, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon <b>said to him:</b> The <i>halakha</i> <b>is no different.</b> In all of these cases she has a presumptive status of ritual purity until she discovers that she is impure.
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi comments: <b>I did not ask</b> about a woman who examined herself <b>on the first</b> day, <b>and I erred</b> in <b>that I did not ask</b> them. If I would have asked them they would have told me that even if she examined herself only on the first day, she still has a presumptive status of ritual purity. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi explains his reasoning: <b>Is that to say</b> that on <b>all</b> of these other days <b>she was not standing with a presumptive</b> status <b>of ritual impurity? And</b> nevertheless, <b>once</b> she performed the examination and her blood is found to have <b>stopped,</b> it is considered to have <b>stopped,</b> and she now has the presumptive status of a woman whose bleeding has stopped. If so, on the <b>first</b> day <b>too, once</b> she performed the examination and her blood is found to have <b>stopped,</b> it is considered to have <b>stopped,</b> and she now has a presumptive status of a woman whose bleeding has stopped.
The Gemara asks: <b>And initially, what</b> did Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>hold?</b> Why didn’t he ask them about a woman who examined herself only on the first day? The Gemara answers that he held that <b>since she has a presumptive status</b> that her <b>spring,</b> i.e., her uterus, <b>is open,</b> as she had just begun experiencing bleeding, an examination conducted on that day is ineffective. In any event, this <i>baraita</i> teaches that there is an opinion that even if a woman examined herself only on the first day, she has a presumptive status of ritual purity.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a <i>zav</i> and a <i>zava</i>,</b> who are required to count and examine themselves on each of seven clean days before purification in a ritual bath, <b>who examined themselves on</b> the <b>first day and found</b> themselves <b>ritually pure,</b> i.e., with no blood, <b>and</b> they examined themselves <b>on the seventh day and found</b> themselves <b>ritually pure, and on the rest of the intervening days they did not examine</b> themselves, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The presumptive status of</b> the <i>zav</i> and the <i>zava</i> is one of <b>ritual purity. Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> In that case, the <i>zav</i> and the <i>zava</i> <b>have</b> counted <b>only the first day and the seventh day,</b> two of the seven clean days, and they must count another five days to complete the tally. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The <i>zav</i> and the <i>zava</i> <b>have</b> counted <b>only</b> the <b>seventh day,</b> and they must count another six days to complete the tally.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer said to Rabbi Yehoshua: According to your statement,</b> that the first day is included in her count of seven, <b>you are counting at intervals,</b> i.e., with days in-between that do not count, <b>and the Torah states:</b> “But if she be purified of her <i>ziva</i>, then she shall count to herself seven days, <b>and after that she shall be pure”</b> (Leviticus 15:28). This teaches that the purification of a <i>zava</i> must be <b>after</b> the seven days, i.e., <b>after all of the</b> days, which must be consecutive so <b>that there are no days of impurity separating between</b> the seven clean days.
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: And you</b> too, <b>do you not concede with regard to a <i>zav</i> who experienced a seminal emission</b> during his count of seven clean days, <b>and with regard to a nazirite who walked</b> under <b>overhanging boughs and protrusions</b> that have items whose status of impurity is uncertain beneath them, <b>that</b> they <b>count at intervals,</b> as both are impure for one day before resuming their counting? <b>And</b> yet <b>the Torah states</b> with regard to a nazirite who definitely contracted ritual impurity from a corpse: <b>“But the former days shall be void,</b> because his consecration was defiled” (Numbers 6:12). This indicates that even in cases where the Torah says that one must count consecutively, it is permitted to count with intervals in between countings.
<b>And</b> how would <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> respond to Rabbi Yehoshua’s claim? He would say: <b>Granted, there</b> in the cases of the <i>zav</i> and the nazirite, <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “This is the law of him that has an issue, and of him from whom an emission of semen goes out, <b>so that he is thereby impure”</b> (Leviticus 15:32). This teaches <b>that</b> when a <i>zav</i> experiences a seminal emission it <b>overturns</b> the counting of <b>only that</b> one <b>day. And if</b> one would claim that the Sages should issue a decree <b>due to</b> the concern that one might <b>confuse</b> the <i>halakha</i> of one who had an emission of <i>ziva</i> during the seven clean days with a <i>zav</i> who had a seminal emission during the seven clean days, that is not a concern. The reason is that an emission of a <b><i>ziva</i></b> will <b>not be confused with</b> the case of <b>one who experienced a seminal emission.</b>
Similarly, Rabbi Eliezer would say that in the case of <b>a nazirite who walked under overhanging boughs and protrusions</b> that have items whose status of impurity is uncertain beneath them, there is <b>also</b> no need to overturn all the previous days of counting, as <b>by Torah law we require a full-fledged tent</b> over a corpse, <b>and</b> it was <b>the Sages who decreed</b> that one who walks under overhanging boughs and protrusions is ritually impure. <b>And</b> a <i>halakha</i> that applies <b>by rabbinic law will not be confused</b> with a <i>halakha</i> that is mandated <b>by Torah law.</b>
<b>But here,</b> in the case of a <i>zava</i> who counts only the first and seventh day, <b>if we are concerned</b> that as she did not count the five intermediate days <b>perhaps she saw</b> blood during those days, and since what occurred on those days is <b>uncertain,</b> only the first day counts for her, then one might <b>come to confuse</b> this situation <b>with</b> a case where she is <b>certain</b> that she saw blood during the intermediate days. One might mistakenly think that even if she definitely experiences bleeding during the intermediate days she can still count the first day as one of her seven clean days before immersing.
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say: The statement of Rabbi Eliezer appears</b> more correct <b>than the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua, and the statement of Rabbi Akiva</b> appears more correct <b>than the statement of all of them. But</b> nevertheless, the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b>
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to <b>a <i>zav</i> and a <i>zava</i> who examined themselves</b> on the <b>first day</b> of their seven clean days and found themselves to be pure, <b>and</b> they examined themselves again on the <b>eighth day and found</b> themselves to be <b>pure, but</b> they did <b>not examine</b> themselves on <b>the remainder of the days,</b>

Daf 69a

<b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> that if they examined themselves on the first and seventh days they are considered to be pure during the intermediate days as well, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we require the first and last</b> days <b>of</b> the seven, <b>and</b> if so, <b>here there is</b> an examination on the <b>first</b> day, and yet <b>there is no</b> examination on the <b>last</b> day, but only on the eighth day? <b>Or perhaps</b> Rabbi Eliezer requires an examination only on the <b>first of</b> the days, and this is sufficient <b>even though there is no</b> examination on the <b>last</b> of the seven days.
<b>Rav said: This</b> case of examining on the first and eighth days <b>is</b> the same as <b>that</b> of examining on the first and seventh days, i.e., Rabbi Eliezer requires an examination only on the <b>first of</b> the days, and this examination is sufficient <b>even though there is no</b> examination on the <b>last of</b> the days. <b>And Rabbi Ḥanina said: We require</b> an examination on <b>the first and last</b> days <b>of</b> the seven, and <b>here there is</b> an examination on the <b>first</b> day but <b>there is no</b> examination on the <b>last</b> day. Consequently, Rabbi Eliezer would not permit a <i>zav</i> or a <i>zava</i> to count any of the days in this case.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rav from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> the Sages <b>agree with regard to a <i>zav</i> and a <i>zava</i> who examined themselves</b> on the <b>first day and</b> on the <b>eighth day and found</b> themselves to be <b>ritually pure, that they have only</b> the <b>eighth</b> day as part of their count. The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> are the Sages who <b>agree</b> to this? Are they <b>not Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua?</b> These two Sages, who disagree in a case where the <i>zav</i> and <i>zava</i> examined themselves on the first and seventh days, are evidently the ones who agree in the case of a woman who performed an examination on the first and the eighth days. This seems to contradict Rav’s opinion.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> the Sages referred to here are <b>Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva.</b> Both of them agree that in this case the first day is not included in the count. Conversely, Rabbi Eliezer would say that the first seven days are included in the count and the eighth day is unnecessary, as there is a presumptive status of ritual purity from her examination on the first day.
§ The Gemara cites another discussion with regard to which days are included in the count of seven clean days. <b>Rav Sheshet says</b> that <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rav says: A menstruating woman who</b> performed the examination marking the first step in her <b>transition</b> from ritual impurity <b>to ritual purity on her third</b> day <b>counts</b> that day as part <b>of the number of seven clean</b> days.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why does a menstruating woman</b> require any kind of <b>counting?</b> If this is during her days when she is expected to menstruate she may immerse after the conclusion of seven days, whether or not those days were clean. <b>Rather, say</b> that Rav meant as follows: <b>A <i>zava</i> who</b> performed the examination marking the first step in her <b>transition</b> from ritual impurity to <b>ritual purity on her third</b> day <b>counts</b> that day as part <b>of the number of seven clean</b> days.
<b>Rav Sheshet said to Rav Yirmeya bar Abba:</b> Did <b>Rav say his <i>halakha</i> in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Samaritans, who say</b> that <b>the day on which</b> a <i>zava</i> <b>ceases</b> to experience the emission of <i>ziva</i> <b>counts toward</b> the <b>number</b> of <b>seven</b> clean days, and she does not need to count seven complete days?
Rav Yirmeya bar Abba replied: <b>When Rav says</b> his <i>halakha</i>, he meant <b>apart from</b> the <b>third</b> day. Rav Sheshet challenged: If Rav meant <b>apart from</b> the <b>third</b> day, that is <b>obvious;</b> there is no need for him to issue such a statement at all. Rav Yirmeya bar Abba replied: <b>No,</b> the statement that she begins counting immediately after the third day is <b>necessary</b> for a case <b>where</b> once she saw that she was clean after the third day of her <i>ziva</i> emissions <b>she did not examine</b> herself again <b>until</b> the <b>seventh</b> day.
<b>And</b> Rav is <b>teaching us</b> two <i>halakhot</i>. <b>There,</b> in the previous discussion with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, Rav stated that an examination <b>at the beginning</b> is sufficient, <b>even though there is no</b> examination at the <b>end</b> of the seven days. <b>And here he teaches us</b> that an examination at the <b>end of</b> the seven days is sufficient, <b>even though there is no</b> examination at the <b>beginning of</b> the seven days, but only on the day when she ceased experiencing bleeding.
Rav Yirmeya adds <b>that</b> it is necessary to teach both <i>halakhot</i>, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>we say</b> that an examination <b>at the beginning</b> is sufficient <b>even though there is no</b> examination at the <b>end of</b> the seven days, <b>as we establish</b> the clean days <b>in</b> accordance with <b>their presumptive status. But</b> one might have thought that Rav would <b>not</b> permit her to consider all the days to have been clean in a case of an examination at the <b>end of</b> the seven days <b>even though there is no</b> examination at the <b>beginning of</b> the seven days, where no presumptive status was established. Therefore, this second statement of Rav <b>teaches us</b> that even if she only examined herself at the end of the seven clean days it is sufficient.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to Rav Yirmeya’s explanation. <b>Is that so? But when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>he said: Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, raised an objection</b> to the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, that a woman who is uncertain whether or not she miscarried an actual fetus must bring an offering (see 29a). The reason is that the majority of pregnant women carry actual fetuses. Rabbi Yosef objected to this from the case of a woman who was <b>forgetful,</b> i.e., a woman who left town when she was pregnant, and later returned no longer pregnant. It is unknown whether she miscarried an actual fetus, and if it was a fetus, whether it was male or female. The conclusion there was that she does not have any days when blood she discharges is considered ritually pure, which is the <i>halakha</i> following a birth, as her miscarriage might not have been a fetus at all. Apparently, here one does not follow the principle that the majority of pregnant women carry actual fetuses.
Ravin continues: <b>And I do not know what his objection is,</b> as the reason that she does not have any days when blood she discharges is considered ritually pure is not only due to the uncertainty as to whether or not she miscarried a fetus, but because it is also unknown when that miscarriage occurred, i.e., even if she miscarried a fetus, perhaps the days when blood she discharges is considered ritually pure had already been completed. <b>As we maintain</b> that the <b>first week that she comes before us,</b> when the court is uncertain with regard to her impurity, <b>we</b> tell <b>her</b> to <b>immerse</b> every <b>night</b> of that week, in the manner of a woman purifying herself after menstruation or childbirth, but <b>we do not</b> tell <b>her</b> to <b>immerse during the daytime,</b> as she has not counted seven clean days (see 29b).
The Gemara explains how this discussion apparently contradicts Rav Yirmeya’s explanation. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>we do not require</b> all seven clean days to be <b>counted before us,</b> i.e., if an examination on the seventh day is sufficient, <b>let us</b> tell her to <b>immerse also</b> during <b>the daytime,</b> as <b>perhaps she gave birth to a male</b> baby <b>during</b> her days <b>of <i>ziva</i>, and</b> already <b>performed her</b> seven days of <b>counting</b> before she came before the court. The Gemara concludes: <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> this statement of Ravin that <b>we require</b> that her seven clean days be <b>counted before us,</b> which is why the court does not instruct her to immerse during the daytime.
The Gemara rejects this contention. <b>But didn’t we interpret</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who said</b> that <b>we require</b> her seven clean days to be <b>counted before us?</b> By contrast, Rav’s statement was in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, who holds that the days do not need to be counted before us.
§ The Gemara stated earlier that according to the opinion of the Rabbis, the seven clean days do not need to be counted before us. The Gemara analyzes their opinion: <b>And from where do you say that according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis we do not require</b> that the seven days be <b>counted before us?</b> This is <b>as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a woman who was <b>forgetful</b> and does not know whether she is now in her days of menstruation or days of <i>ziva</i>, <b>who said: I saw</b> blood on <b>one day of impurity,</b> the court instructs <b>her to immerse nine immersions.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> clarifies: Since there is no way of knowing whether she is a woman purifying herself after menstruation or after <i>ziva</i>, she must immerse <b>seven</b> immersions on the following seven nights, <b>for</b> purification from <b>menstruation,</b> as each of these days might be the last of the seven days of menstruation. <b>And</b> she must also immerse during <b>two</b> days as purification <b>from <i>ziva</i>,</b> i.e., on the day that she arrives, in case she experienced bleeding the day before, and on the following day, as perhaps she experienced bleeding on the day of her arrival. But if this woman says: <b>I saw</b> blood <b>at twilight</b> that renders me <b>impure,</b> the court instructs <b>her</b> to <b>immerse eleven immersions.</b>
The Gemara asks: These <b>eleven</b> days, <b>what is their purpose?</b> If she would normally require nine immersions, why does she require an extra two immersions if she experienced bleeding at twilight? <b>Rav Yirmeya of Difti said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring specifically to a case <b>where she came before us at twilight</b> and says that she also experienced bleeding at twilight, but it is not clear whether she experienced bleeding on a previous day at twilight, or today at twilight.
Rav Yirmeya explains: Therefore, she requires <b>eight</b> immersions to purify herself <b>from menstruation,</b> seven in case each of the following nights is the night after the seventh day of menstruation, and the eighth in case she experienced bleeding during twilight of the day she arrived, and this occurred in a time which was actually part of the next day, such that she needs to immerse also on the eighth night from her arrival, <b>and three</b> additional immersions during the day to purify herself <b>from <i>ziva</i>.</b> She must immerse during the day three times: She must immerse immediately, because if she experienced bleeding on the previous day during twilight it may have still been day, and right now, at twilight, it might still be day; she must immerse on the next day, because if she experienced bleeding on the previous day during twilight it may have already been night; and she must immerse during the day following the next day, because perhaps she experienced bleeding this twilight after it was night.
If this woman who is forgetful with regard to her cycle of menstruation and <i>ziva</i> says: <b>I have not seen any</b> blood <b>at all,</b> the court instructs <b>her to immerse fifteen immersions. Rava said,</b> in reference to this final <i>halakha</i> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>This <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not</b> a logical <b><i>halakha</i>.</b> Rather, it is like the <i>halakha</i> that <b>they judge in</b> a place named <b>Galaḥi.</b> In that place they follow the behavior of Sodom, and say that with regard to one <b>who has</b> one <b>ox, he must shepherd</b> the local flocks <b>one day,</b> and one <b>who does not have an ox must shepherd</b> the local flocks for <b>two days.</b> It is not logical that a woman who has not experienced a flow of blood must immerse more times than one who has experienced a flow of blood.
Apropos the mention of Galaḥi, the Gemara relates an incident that occurred in that place. <b>There was an orphan</b> in that town, <b>the son of a widow [<i>armelata</i>],</b> who had no oxen of his own. The people of that town <b>gave him their oxen</b> to shepherd. This orphan <b>went and slaughtered</b> all of the oxen. <b>He said</b> to the townspeople: Whoever <b>has an ox should take one skin,</b> while one <b>who does not have an ox should take two skins.</b> The people of Galaḥi <b>said to</b> the orphan: <b>What is this that you are saying,</b> i.e., what is the reason? <b>He said to them: The end of the law is like the beginning of the law: Isn’t the beginning of the law</b> that one <b>who has no</b> ox <b>is preferred,</b> and must shepherd the oxen for two days? So too, with regard to <b>the end of the law,</b> one <b>who has no</b> ox <b>is preferred</b> and should receive two hides.
The Gemara returns to discuss Rava’s comment with regard to the ruling of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Here too</b> one can claim: <b>And if</b> in a case <b>where she says: I saw</b> blood, <b>it is sufficient for her</b> to immerse <b>either nine immersions or eleven immersions,</b> so too, in a case <b>where she says: I did not see</b> any flow of blood at all, is it logical that <b>she requires fifteen immersions?</b>
<b>Rather, say</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> means: If a woman says: <b>I saw</b> a flow of blood <b>but I do not know how many</b> days <b>I saw</b> blood, and likewise I do not know <b>whether I saw</b> the flow <b>during the days of menstruation or</b> if <b>I saw</b> the flow <b>during the days of <i>ziva</i>,</b> in such a case, the court instructs <b>her to immerse fifteen immersions.</b> The reason for these immersions is as follows: If <b>she comes before us during the daytime, we give her seven</b> immersions, beginning from that night, to remove the impurity <b>of menstruation.</b> Any of those seven nights might be the night after the last of her days of menstruation.

Daf 69b

<b>And</b> she requires <b>eight</b> immersions during the day to purify her <b>from</b> her <b><i>ziva</i>,</b> as it is possible that she experienced bleeding for three consecutive days, rendering her a greater <i>zava</i>, and one of those was on this day that she came before the court, and it is also possible that the day she arrived she did not experience bleeding, and she was a <i>zava</i> during her last clean day and had to immerse that day. If <b>she comes before us at night, we give her eight</b> immersions to purify herself <b>from her menstruation,</b> including one on the night that she comes before the court, <b>and seven</b> immersions during the day to purify herself <b>from</b> her <b><i>ziva</i>.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: With regard to her <b><i>ziva</i>,</b> she still <b>requires eight</b> immersions. Since it is possible that she experienced bleeding for the third day on the day before coming to the court, she might be a greater <i>zava</i>, who starts her clean days only the day after she arrived. In addition, any of the first seven days may be the last clean day, on which she has to immerse herself. The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> in both <b>this</b> case <b>and that</b> case she requires <b>seven</b> immersions to purify herself <b>from</b> the impurity of <b>menstruation, and eight</b> immersions to purify herself <b>from</b> the impurity of <b><i>ziva</i>.</b>
The Gemara raises a further difficulty: If the woman comes <b>at night</b> to the court, she <b>requires eight</b> immersions to purify herself <b>from</b> her impurity of <b>menstruation.</b> Why does the <i>baraita</i> require her to immerse a total of only fifteen times when there are cases where she must immerse sixteen times?
The Gemara answers: With regard to purifying herself from the impurity of <b><i>ziva</i>, which</b> can be taught in <b>a distinct</b> manner, <b>as there is no difference whether she comes before us during the day</b> and <b>there is no difference whether she comes before us at night,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>counts</b> the fixed amount of eight immersions. By contrast, with regard to purifying herself from <b>menstruation, which</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>cannot</b> teach in <b>a distinct</b> manner, <b>as when she comes before us at night she requires eight</b> immersions but if she comes before us <b>during the day</b> she does <b>not require eight</b> immersions, the <i>tanna</i> <b>did not count</b> both options, but mentioned only seven immersions, which is the minimum number required.
The Gemara returns to the initial purpose of this discussion, which was to indicate that the Rabbis do not require all seven days of counting before the court. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>we require</b> seven days of <b>counting before us, why do I</b> need <b>all of these immersions? She</b> should <b>count seven</b> clean days <b>and</b> only <b>afterward immerse. Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from this</b> that the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Akiva and <b>who say</b> that <b>we do not require</b> seven days of <b>counting before us?</b>
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Yosef, said to Rav Ashi,</b> in rejection of this proof: But <b>didn’t you resolve</b> a difficulty in the <i>baraita</i>? Since you admit that the <i>baraita</i> in any event requires revision, <b>resolve</b> this difficulty too, <b>and say this:</b> If a woman comes and says: <b>I counted</b> clean days <b>but I do not know how many</b> days <b>I counted,</b> and I do not know <b>whether I counted during the days of menstruation or whether I counted during the days of <i>ziva</i>,</b> the court instructs <b>her to immerse fifteen immersions.</b> If so, there is no proof that the Rabbis hold that the counting does not need to be before the court.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>: If it is referring to a case where the woman said: <b>I counted</b> clean days <b>but I do not know how many</b> days <b>I counted, it is impossible that she did not count at least one</b> clean <b>day.</b> If so, she should not be required to immerse on the eighth day, in which case <b>she is lacking</b> one <b>immersion,</b> as the <i>baraita</i> rules that she must immerse fifteen times.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, say</b> that she claims: <b>I do not know if I counted</b> any clean days <b>or I did not count</b> any clean days. Likewise, she does not know whether she saw the blood during her days of menstruation or during her days of <i>ziva</i>. Therefore, she must immerse fifteen times, as it is possible that she has not yet counted at all.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The corpses of <b>a <i>zav</i>, and a <i>zava</i>, and a menstruating woman, and a woman after childbirth, and a leper, who died, transmit ritual impurity by carrying</b> their corpses, <b>until the flesh decays.</b> With regard to the corpse of <b>a gentile who died,</b> although when alive he transmits impurity like a <i>zav</i>, once he dies he is <b>ritually pure</b> and is prevented <b>from transmitting impurity.</b>
<b>Beit Shammai say:</b> The status of <b>all women</b> when they <b>die</b> is as though they were <b>menstruating women</b> at the time of death. Therefore, the garments that they were wearing before they died are impure and require immersion. <b>And Beit Hillel say: Only</b> a woman <b>who died</b> with the impurity of <b>a menstruating woman</b> has the status of <b>a menstruating woman</b> after death.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the corpse of one of these impure people transmits ritual impurity by carrying. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does the mishna mean by the term: <b>By carrying? If we say</b> that it <b>literally</b> means <b>by carrying,</b> that is difficult: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>every</b> other <b>corpse does not impart ritual impurity by carrying?</b> Since every corpse imparts impurity through carrying, why does the mishna need to specify this <i>halakha</i> in these specific cases?
<b>Rather, what</b> does the mishna mean when it states: <b>By carrying [<i>bemassa</i>]?</b> It means imparting impurity <b>through a very heavy stone [<i>even mesama</i>].</b> There is a unique <i>halakha</i> with regard to the ritual impurity of a <i>zav</i> and a menstruating woman. If they sit on an item, even one that cannot become ritually impure, and beneath that item there is a vessel, although the weight of the <i>zav</i> or the menstruating woman has no physical effect on the vessel, it becomes ritually impure.
The Gemara notes that the word <i>mesama</i> is based on a verse, <b>as it is written: “And a stone was brought and placed [<i>vesumat</i>] upon the mouth of the den;</b> and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords, that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel” (Daniel 6:18). Accordingly, the mishna is teaching that although a corpse does not normally impart ritual impurity to vessels under a heavy stone, these specific types of corpses do transmit impurity in this manner.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that the Sages decreed that these specific types of corpses impart ritual impurity through a heavy stone? <b>Rav said:</b> It is <b>a decree</b> due to the possibility that <b>perhaps</b> one of these people might <b>faint</b> while sitting on the heavy stone, and it might be mistakenly thought they are dead and do not impart impurity to the vessels beneath.
A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the Sages <b>said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer:</b> All of these types of corpses listed in the mishna impart ritual impurity through a heavy stone <b>until the belly</b> of the corpse <b>bursts.</b> The Sages imposed their decree only in cases where the corpse resembles a person who has fainted. Once the corpse is clearly no longer alive, it no longer imparts ritual impurity through a heavy stone.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to the corpse of <b>a gentile who died,</b> although when alive he transmits impurity like a <i>zav</i>, once he dies he is ritually pure and is prevented from transmitting impurity. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: For what</b> reason <b>did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that the corpse of <b>a gentile who died is ritually pure</b> and is prevented <b>from transmitting impurity by carrying? Because his impurity</b> that he transmits even <b>when alive is not by Torah law, but by rabbinic law.</b> The Sages decreed that every living gentile imparts ritual impurity in the manner of a <i>zav</i>; they did not extend their decree to include the corpse of a gentile in the manner of the corpse of a <i>zav</i>.
§ <b>The Sages taught: The</b> wise <b>people of Alexandria asked twelve matters of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥinnana. Three</b> of them were <b>matters of wisdom, three</b> were <b>matters of <i>aggada</i>, three</b> were <b>matters of ignorance,</b> and <b>three</b> were <b>matters of behavior.</b>
The Gemara lists the questions. <b>Three</b> were <b>matters of wisdom:</b> The first question was with regard to <b>a <i>zav</i> and a <i>zava</i> and a menstruating woman and a woman after childbirth and the leper, who died: Until when do they transmit ritual impurity by carrying?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them: Until the flesh decays.</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> taught in the mishna.
The second question referred to the <b>daughter</b> of a wife who had been <b>sent away</b> by her husband, i.e., divorced, who then married another, but after her divorce from her second husband or his death she returned and remarried her first husband, to whom she is forbidden (see Deuteronomy 24:1–4), and a daughter was born from this marriage. <b>What</b> is <b>her,</b> i.e., the daughter’s, status <b>with regard to</b> marrying <b>a priest?</b>
<b>Do we say an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And if</b> in the case of <b>a widow</b> married <b>to a High Priest, whose prohibition does not apply to all,</b> i.e., it is prohibited for her only to marry a High Priest (see Leviticus 21:13–15), and yet the lineage of <b>her son is flawed,</b> as he is disqualified from the priesthood, then in the case of <b>this</b> daughter of a remarried divorcée, <b>whose prohibition applies equally to all</b> men, <b>is it not right that her son</b> should be of <b>flawed</b> lineage? <b>Or perhaps</b> this comparison can be refuted: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a widow married to a High Priest?</b> It is notable in <b>that she herself is disqualified</b> from the priesthood, i.e., if a High Priest engages in intercourse with her she is disqualified from partaking of <i>teruma</i>, whereas a remarried divorcée is not disqualified from partaking of <i>teruma</i>.
Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them:</b>

Daf 70a

With regard to one who remarries his divorced wife, the Torah states: “Her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after she is defiled, for that is an abomination before the Lord; and you shall not cause the land to sin, which the Lord your God gives you for an inheritance” (Deuteronomy 24:4). By inference, <b>she,</b> the divorced wife, <b>is an abomination, but her children are not abominations.</b> In other words, if he transgressed the prohibition and remarried this woman, the daughters from that marriage are not disqualified from marrying priests.
The third question was as follows: <b>Two</b> wealthy people who were <b>lepers</b> came to purify themselves and each brought a sin offering, a guilt offering, and a burnt offering. <b>Their offerings became intermingled with each other, and the offering of one of them was sacrificed, and</b> subsequently <b>one of them died. What shall be with the second</b> individual, i.e., how can he complete his purification process? If the other one had not died, they could both bring the remaining offering with the stipulation that it should be sacrificed on behalf of whoever is the owner. But now that one is dead, the other person may not bring the remaining animal, as one may not sacrifice a sin offering for one who is dead. He may also not bring another animal instead, as the animal that was already sacrificed might have been his, and one may not bring a second sin offering.
Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them:</b> The solution is for him to <b>write</b> a contract giving all <b>his possessions to others,</b> whom he trusts to return them as a gift later, <b>and he is</b> then considered to be <b>destitute. And</b> as a poor leper, he <b>brings a bird sin offering,</b> which can be <b>brought</b> even <b>in</b> a case of <b>uncertainty.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>But there is</b> the <b>guilt offering</b> that a leper must bring, and this must be an animal not a bird, and may not be brought in a case of uncertainty. How can this leper bring his guilt offering? <b>Shmuel says:</b> Rabbi Yehoshua was referring specifically to a case <b>where his guilt offering</b> had already been <b>sacrificed,</b> before the animals became intermingled.
<b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> Is it possible that <b>a great man like Shmuel would say a statement like this? In accordance with whose</b> opinion does this solution apply? <b>If it is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that if the leper was wealthy when he sacrificed his <b>guilt offering</b> he <b>has</b> thereby <b>fixed</b> his manner of atonement, and must bring animals as his other two offerings, it is difficult: <b>And once he fixed his guilt offering</b> as an animal <b>while he was wealthy, he may not bring</b> a bird <b>sin offering when he is destitute.</b>
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 14:11): With regard to <b>a leper who brought an offering of a destitute person and</b> thereafter <b>he became wealthy, or</b> if he brought an offering of <b>a wealthy person and</b> thereafter <b>he became destitute, everything follows after</b> the <b>sin offering;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon.</b> If he was wealthy when he brought the sin offering, he brings the burnt offering of the wealthy; if he was destitute at that time, he brings the burnt offering of the destitute.
<b>And Rabbi Yehuda says: Everything,</b> i.e., the sin offering and the burnt offering, <b>follows after</b> his status at the time that his <b>guilt offering</b> was brought. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: Everything follows after</b> the offering of the <b>birds,</b> brought seven days earlier, at the start of his purification process.
Rav Sheshet continues: <b>And if</b> Rabbi Yehoshua’s statement is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who said</b> that the <b>sin offering fixed</b> the status of the remaining offerings, it is difficult: Why did Shmuel state that the case is where his guilt offering had already been sacrificed? <b>Even if the guilt offering had not been sacrificed</b> before the animals became intermingled, <b>let him bring another</b> animal as his guilt offering, and stipulate that if the guilt offering that was already slaughtered was his, this animal should be a peace offering. <b>As we have heard that Rabbi Shimon said: Let him bring</b> another animal <b>and stipulate</b> with regard to it.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says,</b> with regard to a leper of uncertain status who must bring a guilt offering and a <i>log</i> of oil for his purification: <b>The following day,</b> on the eighth day of his purification, he <b>brings his guilt offering and his <i>log</i></b> of oil <b>with it, and</b> the priest <b>stands him at the Gate of Nicanor, and</b> the leper <b>stipulates with regard to</b> the offering <b>and says: If this</b> person, i.e., I, was <b>a leper, this is his guilt offering and</b> this is <b>his <i>log</i></b> of oil <b>with it. And if not, this</b> animal that I brought for <b>a guilt offering shall be a voluntary peace offering,</b> as the two offerings are sacrificed in the same manner.
<b>And that guilt offering</b> of uncertain status <b>requires</b>

Daf 70b

that <b>its slaughter</b> must be performed <b>in the north</b> of the Temple courtyard, as in the case of a guilt offering, <b>and</b> it <b>requires placement</b> of the blood on the right <b>thumb and</b> right <b>big toe</b> and right earlobe of the leper, as described in Leviticus 14:14, <b>and</b> it requires <b>placing hands</b> on the head of the animal, <b>and</b> the accompanying wine <b>libations and waving of the breast and thigh,</b> like a peace offering. <b>And it is eaten by males of the priesthood for</b> one <b>day and</b> the following <b>night,</b> like a guilt offering, rather than for two days, like a peace offering.
<b>But the Rabbis did not concede to Rabbi Shimon, because</b> they hold that he thereby <b>brings sacrificial</b> animals <b>to a situation</b> where the time that they may be eaten is restricted, thereby increasing <b>the</b> likelihood of <b>disqualification,</b> as it might be a peace offering, which may be eaten for two days and one night.
The Gemara answers that <b>Shmuel holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon with regard to one</b> <i>halakha</i>, i.e., that it is not the guilt offering that fixes whether the leper must bring the offerings of a wealthy person or a destitute person, <b>but he disagrees with him with regard to one</b> other <i>halakha</i>, as he does not permit such a stipulation in the case of a guilt offering.
The Gemara details the <b>three matters of <i>aggada</i></b> that the sages of Alexandria asked Rabbi Yehoshua. <b>One verse states: “For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dies,</b> says the Lord God; but turn yourselves, and live” (Ezekiel 18:32). <b>And one verse states,</b> with regard to the sons of Eli the High Priest, who did not pay attention to the reproof of their father: “If one man sins against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sins against the Lord, who shall pray for him? But they did not listen to the voice of their father, <b>because the Lord desired to kill them”</b> (I Samuel 2:25). Rabbi Yehoshua replied to them: <b>Here,</b> the verse in Ezekiel is referring to a case <b>where</b> the sinners <b>repent,</b> whereas <b>there,</b> the verse in Samuel is speaking of a case <b>where</b> the sinners <b>do not repent.</b>
The sages of Alexandria also asked the following: <b>One verse states: “For</b> the Lord your God, He is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the awful, <b>Who shows no favor nor takes graft”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:17), <b>and one verse states: “The Lord shall show favor to you</b> and give you peace” (Numbers 6:26). How can this contradiction be resolved? Rabbi Yehoshua replied to them: <b>Here,</b> the verse in Numbers is dealing with the time <b>before</b> one’s <b>sentence</b> is issued, when God shows favor and forgives; <b>there,</b> the verse in Deuteronomy is referring to <b>after</b> the <b>sentence</b> has been issued, when He no longer forgives.
The sages of Alexandria further asked: <b>One verse states: “For the Lord has chosen Zion;</b> He has desired it for His dwelling place” (Psalms 132:13), <b>and one verse states: “For this city has been to Me a provocation of My anger and of My fury from the day that they built it until this day,</b> so that I should remove it from before My face” (Jeremiah 32:31). Rabbi Yehoshua replied to them: <b>Here,</b> the verse in Psalms is referring to the time <b>before Solomon married Pharaoh’s daughter</b> (see I Kings 3:1), whereas <b>there,</b> the verse in Jeremiah is speaking of the time <b>after Solomon married Pharaoh’s daughter.</b>
The Gemara lists the <b>three matters of ignorance</b> that the sages of Alexandria asked Rabbi Yehoshua. <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the wife of Lot,</b> who was turned into a pillar of salt as she fled from the city of Sodom (Genesis 19:26), in terms of whether <b>she transmits ritual impurity</b> as a corpse? Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them: A corpse transmits ritual impurity, but a pillar of salt,</b> even if it was formerly a person, <b>does not impart ritual impurity.</b>
The sages of Alexandria also asked Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the son of the Shunammite</b> woman, who died and was brought to life by Elisha (II Kings 4:33–36), in terms of whether <b>he transmits ritual impurity</b> as a corpse? Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them: A corpse transmits ritual impurity, but a living</b> person <b>does not transmit ritual impurity,</b> even if he had been dead temporarily.
The sages of Alexandria also asked Rabbi Yehoshua: With regard to <b>the dead</b> who will be resurrected <b>in the future,</b> will they <b>require sprinkling</b> with ashes of the red heifer on the <b>third and seventh</b> days, like one who is purified after coming into contact with a corpse, <b>or</b> will <b>they not require</b> that sprinkling? Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them: When they come to life, we will be clever for them</b> and clarify the <i>halakha</i>. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Rabbi Yehoshua said to them: <b>When Moses our teacher comes with them,</b> he will tell us the correct <i>halakha</i>.
The sages of Alexandria also asked Rabbi Yehoshua <b>three matters of behavior: What</b> should <b>a person do to become wise?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them:</b> He should <b>increase</b> his time spent <b>sitting</b> in the study house <b>and minimize</b> his dealings <b>in merchandise.</b> The sages of Alexandria <b>said</b> to Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>Many</b> people <b>have done so, and</b> it <b>did not help them</b> to acquire wisdom. Rabbi Yehoshua responded: <b>Rather, they should pray for mercy</b> to receive wisdom <b>from the One to Whom wisdom belongs, as it is stated: “For the Lord gives wisdom; out of His mouth comes knowledge and discernment”</b> (Proverbs 2:6).
With regard to the subject of wisdom, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches a parable of a flesh-and-blood king who prepared a feast for his servants.</b> The servants eat the food placed before them, <b>but</b> in addition <b>he sends</b> some <b>of</b> the food <b>that is before him to those he loves.</b> Similarly, God sends some of His wisdom to those He loves, as the verse states: “For the Lord gives wisdom.”
The Gemara asks: Since the path to wisdom is through prayer, <b>what is</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>teaching us</b> when he says that one should increase his time spent sitting and studying? The Gemara answers that Rabbi Yehoshua is teaching <b>that this,</b> prayer, <b>without that,</b> sitting and learning, <b>does not suffice.</b>
The sages of Alexandria asked: <b>What</b> should <b>a person do to become wealthy?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them:</b> He should <b>increase</b> his time involved in <b>merchandise and conduct his business faithfully.</b> The sages of Alexandria <b>said</b> to Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>Many</b> people <b>have done so, and</b> it <b>did not help them</b> become rich. Rabbi Yehoshua replied: <b>Rather, they should pray for mercy</b> to receive wisdom <b>from the One to Whom wealth belongs, as it is stated: “Mine is the silver, and Mine the gold,</b> says the Lord of hosts” (Haggai 2:8).
The Gemara asks: Since the path to wealth is through prayer, <b>what is</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>teaching us</b> when he says that one should increase his time spent involved in merchandise and conduct his business faithfully? Once again, the Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehoshua is teaching <b>that this,</b> prayer, <b>without that,</b> being involved in honest business, <b>does not suffice.</b>
The sages of Alexandria further asked: <b>What</b> should <b>a person do to have male children?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them:</b> He should <b>marry a woman who is fit for him</b>

Daf 71a

<b>and sanctify himself</b> by acting modestly <b>at the time of sexual intercourse.</b>
The sages of Alexandria <b>said</b> to Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>Many</b> people <b>have done so, and</b> it <b>did not help them.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua said: <b>Rather, they should pray</b> to receive sons <b>from the One to Whom sons belong, as it is stated: “Behold, children are a heritage of the Lord; the fruit of the womb is a reward”</b> (Psalms 127:3).
The Gemara again asks: Since the path to sons is through prayer, <b>what is</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>teaching us</b> when he said that one should marry an appropriate woman and conduct himself with modesty during intercourse? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehoshua is teaching <b>that this,</b> prayer, <b>without that,</b> marrying an appropriate woman and being modest, <b>does not suffice.</b>
With regard to the verse from Psalms, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>“The fruit of the womb is a reward”</b> (Psalms 127:3)? What act is rewarded here? <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: In reward for</b> men <b>withholding their</b> semen <b>in their belly in order</b> to allow <b>their wives to emit seed first, the Holy One, Blessed be He, gives him the reward of the fruit of the womb,</b> i.e., sons.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> The status of all women when they die is as though they were menstruating women. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Beit Shammai? If we say</b> that their opinion is <b>due to</b> that <b>which is written: “Then the queen was exceedingly distressed [<i>vatitḥalḥal</i>]”</b> (Esther 4:4), this is difficult. The Gemara first explains the derivation. <b>And Rav said:</b> This <b>teaches that she began to menstruate</b> out of fear, as the cavities [<i>ḥalalim</i>] of her body opened. <b>Here too,</b> when a woman is about to die, <b>due to the fear of the Angel of Death she sees</b> blood. This is difficult, as <b>didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (39a) <b>that trepidation eliminates</b> the flow of menstrual <b>blood?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult. Anxiety</b> generated by extended worry <b>contracts</b> the muscles and prevents the blood from flowing, but sudden <b>fear relaxes</b> the muscles and causes the blood to flow.
<b>But</b> if the reason Beit Shammai hold that all women who die have the status of menstruating women is due to fear, then what about <b>that which we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> The status of <b>all men</b> when they <b>die</b> is as though they were <b><i>zavim</i>; and Beit Hillel say: Only</b> a man <b>who died</b> with the impurity of <b>a <i>zav</i></b> has the status of <b>a <i>zav</i>.</b> If the reason that Beit Shammai maintain that all women who die have the status of menstruating women is due to fear of the Angel of Death, presumably they also should consider all men who die to have the status of a <i>zav</i> for the same reason.
But this is difficult, as <b>I will apply here</b> the principle stated with regard to a <i>zav</i>: “An issue <b>out of his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 15:2) renders a man impure, <b>but not</b> an issue <b>due to circumstances beyond his control.</b> If a man has a discharge of <i>ziva</i> due to an illness or some accident, he does not become impure. Consequently, if he has a discharge due to fear after seeing the Angel of Death, he would not become ritually impure.
<b>Rather, the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Beit Shammai</b> is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>At first they would</b> ritually <b>immerse</b> all the <b>utensils</b> that had been used <b>by</b> women who <b>died</b> while <b>menstruating,</b> which had thereby contracted ritual impurity even if the utensils did not touch the women after their death. <b>And</b> as a result, <b>the living menstruating women were embarrassed,</b> as they saw that the status of a menstruating woman is so severe that it remains even after death. The Sages therefore <b>instituted that one must immerse</b> the utensils which had been used <b>by all</b> dying <b>women, due to the honor of living menstruating women.</b>
Similarly, <b>at first they would immerse</b> all the utensils that had been used by <b><i>zavin</i>,</b> men suffering from gonorrhea, <b>who died,</b> as the utensils had thereby contracted ritual impurity even if the utensils did not touch the men after their death. <b>And</b> as a result, <b>the living <i>zavin</i> were embarrassed.</b> Therefore, the Sages <b>instituted that one must immerse</b> the utensils that had been used <b>by all</b> dying men, <b>due to the honor of the living <i>zavin</i>.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a woman who died, and</b> after her death <b>a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of blood emerged from her</b> body, although the blood emerged after death, it <b>transmits ritual impurity</b> by touching and carrying, <b>due to</b> the impurity of the <b>spot</b> of blood of a menstruating woman. This impurity as blood of menstruation applies to any amount of blood she emits, despite the <i>halakha</i> that generally, the blood of a corpse transmits impurity only if it is at least a quarter-<i>log</i> in volume. <b>And</b> as it is a quarter-<i>log</i> of blood, <b>it transmits impurity in a tent,</b> as it is the blood of a corpse.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> That quarter-<i>log</i> of blood <b>does not transmit impurity due to</b> the impurity of the <b>spot</b> of blood of a menstruating woman, <b>because that</b> blood <b>was displaced after she died. And Rabbi Yehuda concedes in</b> the case of a woman who is <b>sitting</b> in childbirth <b>on the travailing chair [<i>mashber</i>] and she died, and a quarter</b><i>-log</i> <b>of blood emerged from her</b> body, <b>that</b> this blood <b>transmits ritual impurity due to</b> the impurity of the <b>spot</b> of blood of a menstruating woman. In that case, the blood was displaced while she was still alive. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: For that</b> reason, that quarter-<i>log</i> of blood <b>does not transmit impurity in a tent,</b> as it did not come from a corpse.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that according to Rabbi Yehuda a quarter-<i>log</i> of blood that emerges from a woman after death does not transmit impurity due to the impurity of a spot of blood of a menstruating woman, despite the fact that it came from the uterus. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>By inference</b> one might think <b>that the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>even though the blood was displaced after she died, it renders</b> one <b>ritually impure due to</b> the impurity of a blood <b>spot.</b> This is not reasonable, as a dead woman cannot attain the status of a menstruating woman.
<b>Rabbi Ze’eiri said:</b> Even the first <i>tanna</i> agrees that blood from the uterus which leaves the body after death does not impart impurity as a spot. Rather, the difference <b>between</b> the opinions of the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Yehuda is whether the <b>place of</b> a woman’s <b>source,</b> i.e., her uterus, <b>is impure,</b> and therefore any blood that passes through there is impure, even if it left her body after death. The first <i>tanna</i> maintains that even blood that appears after her death transmits impurity like the blood of menstruation, as it passed through the uterus when she was still alive, whereas Rabbi Yehuda holds that this blood does not transmit impurity as blood of menstruation, despite the fact that it passed through her uterus.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And Rabbi Yehuda concedes</b> in the case of a woman who was sitting in childbirth when she died, that the quarter-<i>log</i> of blood which emerged from her body transmits the ritual impurity of the spot of the blood of a menstruating woman. And Rabbi Yosei said: For that reason, that quarter-<i>log</i> of blood does not transmit impurity in a tent.
The Gemara asks: <b>By inference,</b> one might conclude <b>that the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that the blood which emerges from a woman who died during childbirth <b>also transmits impurity in a tent.</b> This cannot be correct, as the blood left her while she was still alive. <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> The difference <b>between</b> Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei is with regard to <b>blood of submission</b> discharged from a body at the time of death, which contains a mixture of blood that leaves a person when he is still alive and blood that emerges after his death. Rabbi Yehuda holds that the blood which emerges from a woman who dies during childbirth is blood of submission, which transmits impurity in a tent by rabbinic law. Rabbi Yosei maintains that it is clear that this blood emerged from her body before she died, and therefore it is not blood of submission.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is blood of submission,</b> which imparts ritual impurity (see 62b)? <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yehuda, explained:</b> The case is one of a person who was <b>killed, from whom</b> a quarter-<i>log</i> of <b>blood emerged,</b> a flow which began <b>while he was alive and</b> continued <b>after his death,</b> and it is <b>uncertain</b> whether a full quarter-<i>log</i> <b>emerged while he was alive</b> and therefore does not transmit ritual impurity, and it is <b>uncertain</b> whether <b>it emerged</b> out <b>after his death,</b> in which case it imparts ritual impurity by Torah law, and it is <b>uncertain</b> whether the quarter-<i>log</i> emerged partly <b>while he was alive and</b> partly <b>after his death. That is blood of submission.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis say</b> that this is not blood of submission, but a case of uncertain ritual impurity by Torah law, as it might all have emerged after death. Therefore, one applies the principle that <b>in a private domain</b> a case of <b>uncertainty</b> is considered to be <b>ritually impure,</b> whereas <b>in a public domain</b> a case of <b>uncertainty</b> is considered to be <b>ritually pure.</b>
<b>Rather, what is blood of submission?</b> The case is one of a person who has been <b>killed from whom a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> of <b>blood emerged while he was alive and</b> continued emerging <b>after his death and has still not stopped</b> coming out. It is clear that a full quarter-<i>log</i> did not emerge after his death, but it is <b>uncertain</b> whether <b>the majority</b> emerged <b>while he was alive and the minority after his death,</b> and equally <b>uncertain</b> whether <b>the minority</b> emerged <b>while he was alive and the majority after his death. That is blood of submission.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> In the case of one who has been <b>killed from whom a quarter</b><i>-log</i> of <b>blood emerged, and he was lying in a bed and his blood was dripping into a hole</b> in the ground, the blood in the ground <b>is ritually impure, because the drop of death is mixed with it. And the Rabbis deem it ritually pure, because</b>

Daf 71b

each <b>first</b> drop and every other <b>first</b> drop is <b>separated</b> from the other drops of blood, i.e., it did not flow in a steady stream. Since the blood initially emerged while he was alive and is pure, every drop of blood which emerged after his death is nullified when it falls into that blood, and therefore the entire puddle of blood is ritually pure. The Gemara asks: <b>The Rabbis are saying well to Rabbi Yehuda;</b> how does he respond to their claim? The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as he said: Blood does not nullify blood.</b>
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> In the case of one who is <b>crucified on wood, whose blood</b> does not drip but <b>runs</b> down the wood <b>to the earth, and a quarter</b><i>-log</i> <b>of blood is found underneath him,</b> the blood is <b>ritually impure. Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> the blood <b>ritually pure.</b> He explains his reasoning: <b>As I say</b> that the quarter-<i>log</i> of blood found underneath the body came out while he was still alive, and <b>the drop of</b> blood that came out after his <b>death remains on the wood.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda, let him say to himself</b> with regard to one who was killed on a bed and his blood is dripping into a hole in the ground: <b>As I say</b> that all the blood found underneath the body emerged while he was still alive and <b>the drop of</b> blood that came out after his <b>death remains on the bed.</b> Why does Rabbi Yehuda deem the blood ritually impure in such a case? The Gemara answers: The case <b>of the bed is different, as</b> the blood <b>seeps</b> through the bed onto the floor, whereas in the case of one who is crucified some of the blood may remain on the tree.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Initially</b> the Sages <b>would say,</b> with regard to a woman who gave birth and observed the seven or fourteen days of impurity for a male or female child, respectively, and then immersed in a ritual bath and <b>who is observing</b> the period <b>of the blood of purity,</b> that <b>she would pour water</b> from a vessel in her hands <b>to</b> rinse <b>the Paschal offering.</b> Although it is permitted for such a woman to engage in intercourse with her husband, her halakhic status is like that of one who immersed that day and the sun has not yet set. She therefore assumes second-degree ritual impurity and confers third-degree ritual impurity upon <i>teruma</i> with which she comes into contact. Consequently, she may touch the vessel, as second-degree ritual impurity does not render a vessel impure. She may not touch the water, as it is designated for rinsing the Paschal offering and therefore it is treated with the sanctity of sacrificial food, which is rendered impure by second-degree ritual impurity.
The Sages <b>then said:</b> Her status <b>is like</b> that of one who came into <b>contact with one impure</b> with impurity imparted by <b>a corpse,</b> i.e., one with first-degree ritual impurity, who renders <b>consecrated</b> items impure. But with regard to all non-sacred items, even non-sacred items treated with the sanctity of sacrificial food, such as the water used to rinse the Paschal offering, she has second-degree ritual impurity. Consequently, it is permitted for her to touch not only the vessel, but the water inside it as well, <b>in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel. Beit Shammai say:</b> The status of the woman is <b>even like</b> that of one who is <b>impure</b> due to contact with <b>a corpse,</b> who is a primary source of ritual impurity and renders even a non-sacred vessel impure.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: A woman who gave birth, observed the days of impurity, immersed in a ritual bath, and who is now observing the period of the blood of purity <b>would pour</b> water from a vessel in her hands to rinse the Paschal offering. The Gemara infers: Pouring from a vessel, <b>yes,</b> this is permitted, but she may <b>not touch</b> the water itself. <b>Apparently, non-sacred</b> produce, e.g., even liquid such as the water for rinsing the Paschal offering, <b>that was prepared according to</b> the level of <b>ritual purity</b> required <b>for sacrificial</b> food, i.e., with the same stringencies as required for sacrificial food, <b>is considered like sacrificial</b> food.
But now <b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: The Sages <b>then said:</b> Her status <b>is like</b> that of one who came into <b>contact with one impure</b> with impurity imparted by <b>a corpse,</b> i.e., one with first-degree ritual impurity, who renders <b>consecrated</b> items impure. This indicates that <b>with regard to consecrated</b> items, <b>yes,</b> she renders them impure, but <b>with regard to non-sacred</b> items, e.g., the water used to rinse the Paschal offering, she does <b>not</b> render them impure. <b>Apparently, non-sacred</b> produce <b>that was prepared according to</b> the level of <b>ritual purity</b> required <b>for sacrificial</b> food <b>is not considered like sacrificial</b> food.
The Gemara explains: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in the latter clause of <b>the mishna? It is</b> the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Abba Shaul says:</b> With regard to <b>one</b> who was ritually impure <b>who immersed that day</b> and is waiting for nightfall for the purification process to be completed, he has the status of one who is impure with <b>first-</b>degree impurity <b>with regard to sacrificial</b> food, in <b>that</b> he <b>renders two</b> items of sacrificial food <b>impure, and disqualifies one</b> additional item. In other words, the first item of sacrificial food that he touches assumes the status of second-degree impurity. A second item that comes into contact with the first item assumes third-degree impurity. A third item that comes into contact with the second assumes fourth-degree impurity and is therefore disqualified from being eaten, but it does not impart impurity to other items.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And</b> Beit Shammai <b>concede</b> to Beit Hillel that a woman observing the days of purity <b>partakes of</b> second-<b>tithe</b> produce, as it is permitted for one who immersed that day to eat second-tithe produce. <b>And she separates</b> part of <b>her</b> dough as <b><i>ḥalla</i>, and she draws</b> the vessel with the part of the dough that she separated <b>near</b> the rest of the dough, <b>and she designates it</b> with the <b>name</b> of <i>ḥalla</i>.
<b>And</b> Beit Shammai further concede to Beit Hillel <b>that if</b> a drop <b>from her saliva or from the blood of purity fell onto a loaf of <i>teruma</i>,</b> the loaf <b>is ritually pure,</b> as any liquid discharged from the body of one who immersed that day is ritually pure.
There is another dispute between the <i>tanna’im</i> with regard to a woman who completed her days of purity. <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> Her immersion at the end of the days of impurity does not render it permitted for her to enter the Temple or to partake of <i>teruma</i>; rather, <b>she requires immersion</b> even <b>at the conclusion</b> of the days of purity. <b>And Beit Hillel say: She does not require immersion at the conclusion</b> of the days of purity to render it permitted for her to partake of <i>teruma</i>, as the immersion at the end of the days of impurity is sufficient.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that Beit Shammai concede to Beit Hillel that the woman observing the days of purity partakes of second-tithe produce. The Gemara explains that the reason is <b>as the Master said:</b> When the period of ritual impurity of a <i>zav</i> or leper has been completed, and he <b>immersed</b> during the day <b>and ascended</b> from the ritual bath, he <b>may partake of</b> second <b>tithe</b> immediately.
The mishna teaches: <b>And she separates</b> part of <b>her</b> dough as <b><i>ḥalla</i>.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>non-consecrated</b> food that is <b>untithed produce with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>,</b> as it has not had <i>ḥalla</i> separated from it, e.g., this dough from which a piece has been set aside for the future separation of <i>ḥalla</i>, <b>is not considered like <i>ḥalla</i>,</b> and therefore is not rendered impure by the contact of a woman observing the days of purity.
The mishna also teaches that she <b>draws</b> the vessel with the part of the dough that she separated <b>near</b> the rest of the dough. The Gemara explains that this is <b>as the Master said:</b> It is <b>a mitzva to separate</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>from</b> produce that is situated <b>nearby</b> the produce it comes to exempt, <i>ab initio</i>.
The mishna states: <b>And she designates it</b> with the <b>name</b> of <i>ḥalla</i>. The Gemara explains that it is necessary for the <i>tanna</i> to teach this <i>halakha</i>, as it might <b>enter your mind to say: Let us decree lest she comes to touch</b> the <i>ḥalla</i> <b>from the outside.</b> Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that there is no such decree.
The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> Beit Shammai concede to Beit Hillel that <b>if</b> a drop <b>from her saliva</b> or from the blood of purity fell onto a loaf of <i>teruma</i>, that the loaf is ritually pure, as any liquid discharged from the body of one who immersed that day is ritually pure. The Gemara explains that the reason is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Tevul Yom</i> 2:1): The <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>liquids</b> that emerge <b>from one who immersed himself that day</b> from his state of ritual impurity <b>is like</b> that of <b>liquids that he touches. And</b> both <b>these and those,</b> the liquids that emanated from him and the liquids that he touched, <b>do not transmit ritual impurity.</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>except for liquids</b> that come <b>from a <i>zav</i>, who is a primary source of ritual impurity.</b>
The mishna teaches that <b>Beit Shammai</b> say: Her immersion at the end of the days of impurity does not render her permitted; rather, she requires immersion even at the end of the days of purity. And Beit Hillel say: The immersion at the end of the days of impurity is sufficient. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between them,</b> i.e., what is the basis of their dispute? <b>Rav Ketina said:</b> The difference <b>between them</b> is with regard to the status of <b>one who immersed that day,</b> i.e., at the end of his time of impurity, and <b>a long</b> time has passed since the immersion. Beit Shammai hold that as a long time has passed, i.e., thirty-three days after the birth of a boy or sixty-six days after the birth of a girl, she may not rely on that immersion. Beit Hillel maintain that she may still rely on that initial immersion.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There is a dispute with regard to a woman <b>who sees</b> blood on the <b>eleventh day,</b> which is the final day of the period fit for the flow of a <i>zava</i>. It is permitted for her to engage in intercourse with her husband after observing one clean day corresponding to the one day that she saw blood, but in this case, she failed to observe one clean day. Rather, <b>she immersed</b> in a ritual bath that <b>evening,</b> the eve of the twelfth day, <b>and</b> then <b>engaged in intercourse</b> with her husband.
<b>Beit Shammai say:</b> Since she did not observe that corresponding clean day, she retains the status of a <i>zava</i>. Therefore both she, the <i>zava</i>, and her husband, who engaged in intercourse with a <i>zava</i>, <b>transmit impurity</b> to items designated for <b>lying or sitting,</b> to the extent that these transmit impurity to food and drink that came in contact with them, and in her case, to people as well. <b>And</b> each of them is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering for participating in intercourse involving a <i>zava</i>.

Daf 72a

<b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> Although they transmit impurity to items designated for lying or sitting, <b>they are exempt from</b> bringing <b>the</b> sin <b>offering.</b> Since the twelfth day is unfit for the flow of a <i>zava</i>, and even if she were to experience bleeding on the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth days she would not become a greater <i>zava</i>, one who experiences bleeding on the eleventh does not need to observe a corresponding clean day.
If the woman <b>immersed on the day following</b> the eleventh day <b>and she engaged in intercourse with</b> the man of <b>her house,</b> i.e., her husband, on that twelfth day <b>and then saw</b> blood, <b>Beit Shammai say: They transmit impurity</b> to items designated for <b>lying or sitting</b> by rabbinic law, as the Sages issued a decree of impurity in the case when the second day is the twelfth day, due to a case when the second day is within the eleven days fit for the flow of a <i>zava</i>. <b>And they are exempt from</b> bringing <b>the</b> sin <b>offering,</b> as she observed part of the twelfth day, and the bleeding she experienced after engaging in intercourse, which occurred during her period of menstruation, is not fit to be appended to the discharge of the <i>zava</i> on the eleventh day.
<b>And Beit Hillel say: That</b> husband <b>is a glutton,</b> as he could not wait for the conclusion of the twelfth day before engaging in intercourse. Nevertheless, the Sages did not issue a decree of impurity. <b>And</b> Beit Hillel <b>concede</b> to Beit Shammai <b>in</b> a case where the woman <b>sees</b> blood <b>in the midst of the eleven-day</b> period, <b>and she immersed in the evening and engaged in intercourse</b> with her husband without observing a corresponding clean day, <b>that they transmit impurity</b> to items designated for <b>lying or sitting. And</b> each of them is <b>liable to</b> bring a sin <b>offering</b> for participating in intercourse involving a <i>zava</i>.
If she saw blood in the midst of the eleven days and observed part of a corresponding clean day and <b>immersed on the day following</b> the day that she saw blood <b>and engaged in intercourse</b> with her husband, <b>that is wayward conduct,</b> as the possibility exists that she will experience bleeding after intercourse that will be appended to the bleeding of the previous day, rendering her a <i>zava</i> and disqualifying the immersion. <b>And</b> the status of ritually impure items with which <b>they came into contact and</b> the status of <b>their intercourse is contingent</b> upon whether she experiences bleeding on the day of her immersion, in which case the ritually pure items become impure and they are liable to bring a sin offering, or whether she does not experience bleeding that day, in which case the ritually pure items remain pure and the woman and man are exempt from bringing a sin offering.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>agree with regard to</b> a woman who <b>immersed</b> at <b>night to</b> purify herself after having been a lesser <b><i>zava</i>, that it is not</b> a valid <b>immersion. And</b> Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel also <b>agree with regard to</b> a woman <b>who sees</b> blood <b>in the midst of</b> her <b>eleven days</b> of <i>ziva</i>, rendering her a lesser <i>zava</i> who must wait one clean day and immerse the day after, <b>but</b> she <b>immersed in the</b> first <b>evening</b> without waiting one clean day <b>and engaged in intercourse</b> with her husband, <b>that she transmits impurity</b> to items designated for <b>lying or sitting</b> that came in contact with the couple, <b>and</b> she and her husband <b>are liable to</b> bring a sin <b>offering.</b>
<b>They disagree only in</b> the case of a woman who sees blood on the <b>eleventh day</b> of her days of <i>ziva</i>, and immersed that evening, and engaged in intercourse with her husband. <b>As Beit Shammai say: They transmit impurity</b> to items designated for <b>lying or sitting and are liable to</b> bring a sin <b>offering, and Beit Hillel deem</b> them <b>exempt from</b> bringing a sin <b>offering.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Beit Shammai said to Beit Hillel: What the difference</b> between the <b>eleventh day</b> itself and another <b>day in the midst of</b> the <b>eleven</b> days of <i>ziva</i>? <b>If you equate</b> the eleventh day to the other days <b>with regard to ritual impurity,</b> will you <b>not equate it with regard to</b> liability to bring <b>an offering?</b>
<b>Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai: No, if you say</b> that she is liable to bring an offering if she experiences bleeding <b>in the midst of the eleven days,</b> that is <b>because the following day combines with it</b> as a day <b>of <i>ziva</i>. Will you say</b> the same <b>with regard to</b> the <b>eleventh day, when the following day does not combine with it</b> as a day <b>of <i>ziva</i>?</b>
<b>Beit Shammai said to</b> Beit Hillel: <b>Apply your method equally. If you equate</b> the two cases, bleeding on the eleventh day and bleeding on one of the other days of <i>ziva</i>, <b>with regard to ritual impurity, equate</b> them also <b>with regard to</b> liability to bring <b>an offering. And if</b> you <b>do not equate</b> them <b>with regard to</b> liability to bring <b>an offering, do not equate</b> them <b>with regard to ritual impurity</b> either.
<b>Beit Hillel said to</b> Beit Shammai: Even <b>if we have brought</b> a woman who experiences bleeding on the eleventh day and the man who engages in intercourse with her <b>to ritual impurity,</b> due to a decree <b>to be stringent,</b> so that people should not confuse one who experiences bleeding on the eleventh day with one who experiences bleeding during the other days with regard to ritual impurity, <b>we will not bring</b> them <b>to</b> the liability of bringing <b>an offering, to be lenient.</b> It would be a leniency to permit them to bring an unnecessary and therefore a non-sacred animal into the Temple courtyard.
<b>And furthermore, from your</b> own <b>statement you are refuted, as you say</b> that if <b>she immersed on the following day and engaged in intercourse, and afterward she saw</b> blood, <b>she transmits impurity</b> to items designated for <b>lying or sitting, but she is exempt from</b> bringing <b>the offering. You too</b> should <b>apply your method equally. If you equate</b> a <i>zava</i> who immersed on the twelfth day with one who immersed on the night after the eleventh day <b>with regard to ritual impurity, equate</b> these cases also <b>with regard to</b> liability to bring <b>an offering.</b>
<b>And if you do not equate</b> them <b>with regard to</b> liability to bring <b>an offering, do not equate</b> them <b>with regard to ritual impurity</b> either. Beit Hillel continued: <b>Rather,</b> you agree with us that the two are equated <b>to be stringent, but not to be lenient.</b> We say that <b>here too,</b> the two should be equated <b>to be stringent but not to be lenient.</b>
§ <b>Rav Huna says,</b> in further clarification of Beit Shammai’s opinion: If a woman experiences bleeding during the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> and must observe one clean day, but did not wait until the conclusion of that second day before immersing, with regard to <b>her</b> items designated for <b>lying or sitting, on the second</b> day, <b>Beit Shammai render</b> them <b>impure</b> by rabbinic law. This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though she has immersed</b> in a ritual bath and <b>even though she did not see</b> any blood after her immersion. <b>What is the reason? Since if she would see</b> blood <b>she</b> would <b>render</b> these surfaces <b>ritually impure</b> by Torah law, <b>now too she renders</b> them <b>ritually impure</b> by rabbinic law.
<b>Rav Yosef said: What is</b> Rav Huna <b>teaching us? We</b> already <b>learn</b> in the mishna: If the woman <b>immersed on the day following</b> the eleventh day <b>and she engaged in intercourse with</b> the man of <b>her house</b> on that twelfth day <b>and then saw</b> blood, <b>Beit Shammai say: They transmit impurity</b> to items designated for <b>lying or sitting</b> by rabbinic law. <b>And they are exempt from</b> bringing <b>the</b> sin <b>offering.</b> Her impurity applies by rabbinic law, lest this case be confused with one where she experiences bleeding during the eleven days when she would be impure by Torah law. By inference, if she experienced bleeding on one of her eleven days and immersed on the following day, she would likewise render items designated for lying or sitting ritually impure by rabbinic law.
<b>Rav Kahana said:</b> Rav Huna is teaching that Beit Shammai render her ritually impure even if she does not experience bleeding. Based on the mishna alone, one might have thought that the case where <b>she saw</b> blood <b>is different,</b> and it is only in this situation that Beit Shammai render her impure by rabbinic law.
<b>Rav Yosef said,</b> in refutation of Rav Kahana’s claim: <b>And if she saw</b> blood on the twelfth day, <b>what of it?</b> A discharge of blood on the twelfth day <b>is a sighting of a menstruating woman,</b> which does not render her a <i>zava</i> by Torah law. Therefore, it is comparable to a case where she experienced bleeding on one day during her eleven days of <i>ziva</i> and immersed on the following day, and she does not experience bleeding on that following day at all.
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: This is what</b> is <b>difficult for Rav Kahana: Granted,</b> in a case <b>where she saw</b> blood on the twelfth day, it stands to reason that <b>we decree</b> impurity with regard to <b>a sighting of a menstruating woman due to a sighting of a <i>zava</i>. But</b> in a case <b>where she did not see</b> any blood at all, for <b>what</b> reason should the Sages <b>decree</b> impurity <b>upon her?</b>
Abaye continues: <b>And furthermore, we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zavim</i> 1:1): If a man <b>sees one sighting of <i>ziva</i></b> (see 35b), <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> His status on the following day is <b>like</b> that of <b>a woman who observes</b> a clean <b>day for a day</b> she experiences a discharge. In other words, he must immerse and observe that day in purity, and if he touches tithes their status is suspended, since if he sees another discharge on that day, they are retroactively impure. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> His status is <b>like</b> that of a man <b>who experiences a seminal emission,</b> who is purified by his immersion, and therefore any tithes this man touches on the second day remain pure even if he later experiences a second discharge.

Daf 72b

<b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>moves the</b> discharge <b>seen</b> by a <i>zav</i> on the first day, <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> Due to the uncertainty, his status of ritual purity is <b>contingent</b> upon whether he sees another emission. If the <i>zav</i> sees a discharge a second time he will retroactively have been a full-fledged <i>zav</i> and his discharge renders one who moves it impure. But if he does not see another discharge he will remain like one who experienced a seminal emission, which means that his discharge does not render one who moves it impure. <b>And Beit Hillel deem</b> him <b>pure.</b> The discharge has the status of a seminal emission and does not transmit impurity to one who moves it.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to items designated for <b>lying or sitting</b> and their status <b>between the first sighting and the second sighting, Beit Shammai</b> say: Due to the uncertainty their status of ritual purity is <b>contingent</b> upon whether he sees another emission, <b>and Beit Hillel deem</b> them <b>pure.</b>
Abaye explains Rav Kahana’s difficulty with Rav Huna’s opinion: It <b>is taught in the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> that if a man <b>sees one sighting of <i>ziva</i>, Beit Shammai say:</b> His status is <b>like</b> that of <b>a woman who observes</b> a clean <b>day for a day</b> she experiences a discharge. <b>Apparently, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai</b> the ritual purity status of <b>a woman who observes</b> a clean <b>day for a day</b> she experiences a discharge is <b>contingent</b> upon whether she experiences an emission of blood. This is difficult for Rav Huna, who explains that Beit Shammai hold that a woman who observes a clean day for each day of discharge is definitely impure, by rabbinic law.
The Gemara answers that Rav Huna would explain: <b>Do not say</b> that his status is like that of <b>a woman who observes</b> a clean <b>day for a day. Rather, say</b> that he is <b>like one who engages in intercourse with a woman who observes</b> a clean <b>day for a day</b> after she has immersed. Rav Huna agrees that items designated for lying or sitting that this man sits or lies on is ritually impure only if she experiences bleeding before the end of the day.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> with regard to <b>him,</b> a man who engages in intercourse with a woman who is observing a clean day for a day, <b>that he does not transmit impurity</b> to items designated for <b>lying or sitting, and what is different</b> with regard to <b>her,</b> that woman herself, <b>that she</b> does <b>transmit impurity to</b> items designated for lying or sitting?
The Gemara explains: With regard to <b>him, as he does not frequently</b> see <b>blood, the Sages did not issue a decree</b> rendering <b>him</b> impure to such an extent, if the woman has not seen blood on the second day. Whereas with regard to <b>her, as she does frequently</b> see <b>blood, the Sages did issue a decree</b> rendering her definitely impure to this degree.
The Gemara further inquires: <b>And</b> since a decree was applied to her, as she commonly sees blood, <b>what is different</b> with regard to items designated for <b>lying or sitting, that she transmits impurity to them, and what is different</b> with regard to the <b>one who engages in intercourse</b> with her, <b>that she does not render him impure?</b>
The Gemara answers: With regard to items designated for <b>lying or sitting, she renders them ritually impure because she frequently</b> sits or lies on them, whereas with regard to <b>one who engages in intercourse</b> with her, <b>which is not</b> nearly as <b>frequent,</b> she does <b>not render him ritually impure.</b>
The Gemara raises another difficulty with regard to Rav Huna’s opinion. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: If she saw blood on the eleventh day and observed part of a corresponding clean day and <b>immersed</b> on <b>the day following</b> the day that she saw blood <b>and engaged in intercourse</b> with her husband, <b>that is wayward conduct,</b> as the possibility exists that she will experience bleeding after intercourse that will be appended to the bleeding of the previous day, rendering her a <i>zava</i> and disqualifying the immersion.
The mishna adds: And the status of ritually impure items with which <b>they came into contact and</b> the status of <b>their intercourse is contingent</b> upon whether she experiences bleeding on the day of her immersion. The Gemara explains the difficulty. <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that <b>all,</b> i.e., Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, <b>agree</b> with this clause of the mishna? If so, Beit Shammai concur that this woman renders items impure only due to uncertainty. This is not in accordance with the statement of Rav Huna.
The Gemara answers: <b>No, this</b> clause of the mishna <b>is</b> only in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said to Beit Hillel: Do you call this</b> type of behavior <b>wayward conduct? But he intended only to engage in intercourse with a menstruating woman.</b> The Gemara questions the meaning of Rabbi Yehuda’s statement. Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that he intended to engage in intercourse with <b>a menstruating woman?</b> The mishna and <i>baraita</i> are not referring to a man who engages in intercourse with a menstruating woman.
<b>Rather, say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda meant that this man intended only <b>to engage in intercourse with a <i>zava</i>.</b> The Gemara rejects this formulation as well: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that Rabbi Yehuda said he intended to engage in intercourse with <b>a <i>zava</i>?</b> The mishna and <i>baraita</i> are not referring to a man who engages in intercourse with a <i>zava</i> either. <b>Rather, say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda meant that this man intended <b>to engage in intercourse with a woman who observes</b> a clean <b>day for a day</b> she experiences a discharge. This <i>baraita</i> indicates that the latter clause of the mishna is only according to the opinion of Beit Hillel, as Rabbi Yehuda directed his comments specifically to them.
§ The Gemara cites another discussion concerning a woman who experiences bleeding toward the end of her eleven days of <i>ziva</i>. <b>It was stated</b> with regard to a woman who experiences bleeding on the <b>tenth</b> day of her eleven days of <i>ziva</i>, that <b>Rav Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b>tenth</b> day is considered <b>like</b> the <b>ninth,</b> i.e., <b>just as</b> the <b>ninth</b> day <b>requires</b> the <b>observance</b> of a day clean from discharges on the following day, <b>so too does</b> the <b>tenth</b> day <b>require observance</b> of a day in case she experiences bleeding on the eleventh day.
<b>Reish Lakish says:</b> The <b>tenth</b> day is considered <b>like</b> the <b>eleventh</b> day, as in such a case it is impossible for her to experience bleeding for the three consecutive days within the eleven days of <i>ziva</i>. <b>Just as</b> the <b>eleventh</b> day <b>does not require</b> the <b>observance</b> of a day clean from discharges, <b>so too</b> the <b>tenth</b> day <b>does not require</b> the <b>observance</b> of a day clean from discharges, since even if she experiences bleeding on both the eleventh and the twelfth days, the last of the three consecutive days was already the start of her days of menstruation, and therefore she does not become a greater <i>zava</i>.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who teach</b> the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish <b>with regard to this</b> case: <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya said to Rabbi Akiva: Even</b> if <b>you</b> were to <b>amplify</b> and derive <i>halakhot</i> from the repeated terms <b>“in oil,” “in oil,”</b> stated with regard to the thanks offering (see Leviticus 7:12) <b>for the entire day, I</b> would <b>not listen to you</b> and accept your claim. <b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>one-half of a <i>log</i></b> is the requisite amount of <b>oil for</b> the <b>thanks offering, and</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>one-quarter</b> of a <i>log</i> is the amount of <b>wine for a nazirite, and</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a woman who experiences an emission of blood during the <b>eleven days that are between</b> one period of <b>menstruation and</b> the next period of <b>menstruation</b> is a <i>zava</i>, each of these is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai.</b> None of the <i>halakhot</i> are derived from verses.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <b><i>halakha</i></b> mentioned here with regard to the eleven days between one period of menstruation and the next? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is referring to the <b><i>halakha</i></b> that distinguishes the first ten days from the <b>eleventh</b> day. <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> It is referring to two <b><i>halakhot</i></b> that distinguish the first ten days from the <b>eleventh.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that this is referring to the <b><i>halakha</i></b> which distinguishes the first ten days from the <b>eleventh. It is</b> the <b>eleventh that does not require</b> the <b>observance</b> of a day clean from discharges, <b>but for the other</b> ten days she must <b>perform observance. And Reish Lakish says:</b> It is referring to two <b><i>halakhot</i></b> that distinguish the first ten days from the <b>eleventh.</b> The <b>eleventh</b> day <b>does not require observance, and it does not</b> serve as a day of <b>observance for the tenth</b> day, i.e., the tenth day also does not require observance. The tenth day does not require observing since day eleven is excluded from being a day of observation for the previous day.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya’s claim that the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> is a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai. Are <b>these <i>halakhot</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai? Not so; rather, <b>these are</b> derived from <b>verses. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one who sees</b> blood for <b>three consecutive days at the beginning of</b> the days of <b>menstruation will be a <i>zava</i></b> and is required to count seven clean days and to bring an offering afterward (see Leviticus 15:28–30).
<b>And</b> if so, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: “And <b>if a woman has a flow, and her flow on her flesh be blood,</b> she shall be in her impurity seven days; and whoever touches her shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:19)? This is referring <b>to</b> one <b>who sees</b> blood on only <b>one day.</b> But perhaps one who sees blood for three days at the beginning of her days of menstruation should become a <i>zava</i>? <b>The verse states:</b>

Daf 73a

“And if a woman has a discharge of her <i>ziva</i> blood for many days <b>not in the time of her menstruation,</b> or if she has a discharge beyond the time of her menstruation, all the days of the issue of her <i>ziva</i> she shall be as in the days of her menstruation: She is impure” (Leviticus 15:25). This verse teaches that a woman becomes a <i>zava</i> only if she experiences bleeding <b>close to</b> her days of <b>menstruation,</b> i.e., on the day following her days of menstruation, but not during her days of menstruation.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that she is a <i>zava</i> in a case where she experiences bleeding <b>close to</b> her time of <b>menstruation. From where</b> do I derive that if she experiences bleeding <b>one day separated from</b> her days of <b>menstruation</b> she is also a <i>zava</i>? <b>The verse states: “Or if she has a discharge</b> beyond the time of her menstruation” (Leviticus 15:25).
The <i>baraita</i> further states: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that she is a <i>zava</i> in a case where she experiences bleeding <b>one day</b> away from her time of menstruation. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to include</b> a case when she experiences bleeding <b>two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,</b> or <b>ten</b> days <b>separated from</b> her days of menstruation that she is also a <i>zava</i>? <b>From where</b> is this derived?
<b>You say</b> as follows: <b>Just as we find</b> with regard to a woman who experiences bleeding <b>on</b> the <b>fourth</b> day of her days of <i>ziva</i>, <b>that</b> it <b>is fit for counting,</b> i.e., if she experiences bleeding for the first time on that day she must count one clean day for the one day that she experienced bleeding, <b>and</b> it <b>is fit for <i>ziva</i>,</b> i.e., if it is the last of three consecutive days of sightings that she becomes a greater <i>zava</i>, <b>so too I will bring</b> and include <b>the tenth</b> day, <b>as</b> it <b>is fit for counting</b> if she experiences bleeding for the first time on that day, <b>and fit for <i>ziva</i></b> if she experiences bleeding for the third consecutive day on the tenth day.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>to include</b> a case where she experiences bleeding on the <b>eleventh</b> day after her days of menstruation? <b>The verse states: “Not in the time of her menstruation”</b> (Leviticus 15:25). One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I include even</b> the <b>twelfth</b> day after her period of menstruation. <b>You</b> must <b>say: No,</b> as that is no longer within her days of <i>ziva</i>.
The <i>baraita</i> further states: <b>And what did you see to include</b> the <b>eleventh</b> day <b>and to exclude</b> the <b>twelfth</b> day? <b>I include</b> the <b>eleventh</b> day <b>as it is fit for counting</b> the seven clean days that follow sightings on three consecutive days which ended on the fourth day, as derived from the verse: <b>“Or if she has a discharge</b> beyond the time of her menstruation” (Leviticus 15:25), as explained; <b>and I exclude</b> the <b>twelfth</b> day <b>as it is not fit for counting</b> the seven clean days after the fourth day, a requirement derived from the same verse: <b>“Or if she has a discharge</b> beyond the time of her menstruation.”
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a woman is impure as a <i>zava</i> if she experiences bleeding for <b>three</b> consecutive <b>days. From where</b> do I derive that she is impure if she experiences bleeding for <b>two</b> consecutive <b>days?</b> The continuation of <b>the verse states:</b> “All the <b>days</b> of the issue of her <i>ziva</i> she shall be as in the days of her menstruation: She is impure” (Leviticus 15:25). The plural “days” indicates two days. <b>From where</b> is it derived that she is impure if she experiences bleeding on only <b>one day? The verse states: “All the days</b> of the issue of her <i>ziva</i> she shall be as in the days of her menstruation: She is impure.”
The <i>baraita</i> further explains that the word <b>“impure”</b> in that verse <b>teaches that</b> a <i>zava</i> <b>renders one who engages in intercourse with her impure,</b> just <b>like a menstruating woman</b> does. The term: <b>“She</b> is impure,” indicates that <b>she,</b> a <i>zava</i>, <b>renders</b> a man <b>who engages in intercourse with her impure, but a <i>zav</i> does not render</b> a woman <b>whom he engages in intercourse</b> with <b>ritually impure.</b>
One might have thought that one who engages in intercourse with a <i>zav</i> has the same status as one who engages in intercourse with a <i>zava</i>. Could <b>this not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference? And if</b> a <i>zava</i>, <b>who does not become impure through</b> three <b>sightings like</b> she becomes impure if she experiences bleeding <b>for</b> three consecutive <b>days,</b> and yet she <b>renders</b> a man <b>who engages in intercourse with her impure,</b> then with regard to a <i>zav</i>, <b>who becomes impure through</b> three <b>sightings</b> even on a single day <b>like</b> he becomes impure by seeing a discharge for three consecutive <b>days, isn’t it logical that he</b> should <b>render</b> a women <b>whom he engages in intercourse</b> with <b>ritually impure?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “She</b> shall be impure.” This teaches that a <i>zava</i> <b>renders</b> a man <b>who engages in intercourse with her impure, but a <i>zav</i> does not render</b> a woman <b>whom he engages in intercourse</b> with <b>ritually impure.</b>
<b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> a <i>zava</i> <b>transmits impurity</b> to items designated for <b>lying or sitting? The verse states:</b> “Every bed which she lies on all the days of her discharge shall be for her <b>like the bed of her menstruation;</b> and everything that she sits on shall be impure, as the impurity of her menstruation” (Leviticus 15:26).
<b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that she transmits impurity to items designated for lying or sitting if she experiences bleeding for <b>three</b> consecutive <b>days</b> and is a greater <i>zava</i>. <b>From where</b> do I derive that she transmits impurity to items designated for lying or sitting if she experiences bleeding for <b>two</b> consecutive <b>days</b> and is only a lesser <i>zava</i>? <b>The verse states “days.”</b> And <b>from where</b> do I derive that she transmits impurity to items designated for lying or sitting even if she experiences bleeding on only <b>one day? The verse states: “All the days</b> of her discharge.”
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that she counts one</b> clean day <b>for</b> experiencing bleeding on <b>one</b> day? <b>The verse states:</b> “All the days of her discharge <b>shall be for her.”</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that she <b>must count seven</b> clean days <b>for</b> experiencing bleeding on <b>two</b> consecutive days. <b>And this is a logical inference: Just as</b> a <i>zav</i>, <b>who does not count one</b> clean day if he sees a discharge <b>on one</b> day, nevertheless <b>must count seven</b> clean days if he sees a discharge <b>on two days,</b> then with regard to a <i>zava</i>, <b>who counts one</b> clean day if she experiences bleeding <b>on one</b> day, <b>isn’t it logical that</b> she should <b>count seven</b> clean days if she experiences bleeding <b>on two</b> consecutive days? <b>The verse states:</b> “All the days of her discharge <b>shall be for her,”</b> which teaches that <b>she counts only her</b> one <b>day</b> even if she experiences bleeding for two consecutive days.
The Gemara explains the difficulty from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Evidently,</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the eleven days of <i>ziva</i> <b>are</b> derived from <b>verses</b> and are not a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai. The Gemara answers: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> these <i>halakhot</i> are derived from <b>verses. According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya</b> they are <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai.
With regard to the verse discussing the days of <i>ziva</i>, <b>Rav Shemaya said to Rabbi Abba:</b> But one can <b>say</b> that if she experiences bleeding <b>during the daytime she shall be a <i>zava</i>,</b> but if she experiences bleeding <b>at night she shall be a menstruating woman,</b> as the verse specifies “days.” Rabbi Abba <b>said to him: With regard to your claim, the verse states: “Beyond the time of her menstruation”</b> (Leviticus 15:25), which teaches that she becomes a <i>zava</i> if she experiences bleeding <b>close to her</b> days of <b>menstruation. When is</b> the time <b>close to her</b> days of <b>menstruation? At night. And</b> with regard to an emission during this time <b>the</b> verse <b>calls her a <i>zava</i>.</b>
The Gemara concludes the tractate with a general statement with regard to Torah study. <b>The school of Elijah taught: Anyone who studies <i>halakhot</i> every day is guaranteed that he is destined for the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “His ways [<i>halikhot</i>] are eternal”</b> (Habakkuk 3:6). <b>Do not read</b> the verse as <b><i>halikhot</i>; rather,</b> read it as <b><i>halakhot</i>.</b> The verse indicates that the study of <i>halakhot</i> brings one to eternal life in the future world.
