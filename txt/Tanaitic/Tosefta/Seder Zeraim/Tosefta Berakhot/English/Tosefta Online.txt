Tosefta Berakhot



Chapter 1

From when do we read Shema in the evenings? “From the time when people come [home] to eat their bread on Shabbat (Sabbath) nights,” [these are] the words of Rebbi Meir. And the Chachamim (Sages) say from the time when the Kohanim (priests) are able to eat their Terumah (heave offering). A sign for this is the coming out of the stars. And even though there is no explicit proof for this matter, there is an indirect reference: “… and half of them were holding spears from the morning twilight until the coming out of the stars.” (Nehemiah 4:15)
Rebbi Shimon says, “Sometimes a person may read it (i.e. The Shema) two times in one night, once before dawn and once after dawn. [And if that happens] it comes out that he fulfills his obligation for the day [reading] and for the night [reading].”...
Rebbi says, “There are four watches in a night. [There is a unit of time called] time period (Onah) which is 1/24th of an hour. And [there is another unit of time called] the time (Et) which is 1/24th of the time period (Onah). And [there is a third unit of time called] the moment (Regah) which is 1/24th of the time (Et).” Rebbi Natan says, “There are three watches in a night, as it is said ‘… the beginning of the middle watch.’ (Judges 7:19) There is no [such thing as a] middle, but only when there is something before it and after it.”
From when do we read the Shema in the morning? Acherim (Others) say, “[from the time] when his friend will be four amot away from him and he recognizes him.” The mitzvah [to say it] is with sunrise in order to connect redemption (Geulah) to prayer (Tefillah), and it will come out that he will pray during the day. Rebbi Yehudah said, “One time I was walking behind Rebbi Akiva and Rebbi Elazar Ben Azaryah and the time came to read the Shema. I supposed they gave up on reading the Shema [right away] because they were busy with the needs of the community. I read [the Shema] and [then] learned [some Torah] and after that they began [reading the Shema], and the sun could already be seen above the mountain tops.”
The grooms and all [others] who are involved in [other] Mitzvot (commandments) are exempt from reading [the] Shema as it is said, “… when you sit in your house”, (Deuteronomy 6:7) [meaning] except for those who are involved in mitzvot, “and when you walk on the way”, (Deuteronomy 6:7) [meaning] except for the grooms.
It happened with Rebbi Yishmael and Rebbi Elazar Ben Azaryah that they were resting in the same place and Rebbi Yishmael was laying down and Rebbi Elazar Ben Azaryah was [standing up] straight. It came time to say Shema. Rebbi Yishmael stood up straight and Rebbi Elazar laid down. Said to him Rebbi Yishmael: “What is this Elazar?” He said [back] to him: “Yishmael, my brother! They say to a person, ‘Why is your beard all grown [so nice]?’ He said [back to them], ‘[it should be sent] against the destroyers’ (i.e. cut off by the scissors). [So too with us] I (Rebbi Elazar Ben Azaryah) who was straight, laid down, you that was laying down, stood up straight?” [So Rebbi Yishmael] said to him: “You laid down to fulfill the words of Bet Shamai, I stood up straight to fulfill the words of Bet Hillel. A different explanation, that the students should not see [that you did like Bet Shamai] and make your words [a] permanent [law].
Why did they say one short [Beracha (blessing)]? In the place where they said to be long, one is not allowed to be short, [and in the place where they said] to be short, one is not allowed to be long. [In the place where they said] to seal off [the Beracha], one is not allowed not to seal off, [in the place where they said] not to seal off [the Beracha], one is not allowed to seal off. [In the place where they said] to begin [the Beracha] with [the word] Baruch (Blessed), one is not allowed not to begin with Baruch, [in the place where they said] not to begin [the Beracha] with Baruch, one is not allowed to begin with Baruch. [In the place where they said] to bend down, one is not allowed not to bend down , [and in the place where they said] not to bend down, one is not allowed to bend down.
These are the Berachot (blessings) which are [coined to be] short: One who blesses on fruit, and on mitzvot, the Beracha (blessing) of Zimun, and the last Beracha of Shema. These are the Berachot which are [coined to be] long: the Beracha of Fast Days, and the Beracha of Rosh Hashana, and the Berachot of Yom Kippur. From [the way] a person [says] his Berachot it is recognizable if he a fool or if he is a sage.
These are the Berachot (blessings) which do not seal off with [the phrase] Baruch [Ata Hashem] (Blessed are You Hashem): One that blesses on the fruit, and on the mitzvot, Birkat Hazimun, and the last Beracha in Birkat Hamazon. Rebbi Yossi Hagelili used to seal off the last Beracha in Birkat Hamazon and [therefore] make it long.
These are the Berachot (blessings) which begin with [the phrase] Baruch [Ata Hashem] (Blessed are You Hashem). All Berachot begin with [the phrase] Baruch [Ata Hashem] except for the Beracha (blessing) which is adjacent to Shema and a Beracha which is adjacent to another Beracha, in [both of] which [cases] we do not begin with [the phrase] Baruch [Ata Hashem].
In these Berachot (blessings) we bow down: the first Beracha (blessing) [of Shemoneh Esreh], in the beginning and at the end, and in [the paragraph of] Modim [in Shemoneh Esreh], in the beginning and at the end. And [as for] one who bows down in every [single] Beracha [of Shemoneh Esreh], we teach him that he should not bow down [in them]. We do not say [the Beracha] together with the one that says the Beracha [for you]. Rebbi Yehudah would say together with the one that made the Beracha, Kadosh Kadosh Kadosh Hashem Tzevaot Melo Kol Haaretz Kevodo (Isaiah 6:3) (Holy, Holy, Holy, Hashem Tzevaot, the earth is full with His glory) and Baruch Kevod Hashem Mimkomo (Ezekiel 3:12) (Blessed be the glory of Hashem from His place). All of these Rebbi Yehudah would say together with the one that made the Beracha.
We mention the Exodus from Egypt at night. Said Rebbi Elazar Ben Azaryah, “Here I am like a seventy year old man and I have not merited to hear that one should mention Exodus from Egypt at night, until the exegesis (Derasha) of Ben Zoma.” “In order that you should remember the day that you left Egypt, all the days of your life." (Deuteronomy 16:3), the days of your life [means] days, all the days of your life [means] nights.” These are the words of Ben Zoma. And the Chachamim (Sages) say, “Days of your life [means] this world, all the days of your life [means] the days of the Mashiach (Messiah).” Ben Zoma said to the Chachamim, “And are we going to mention the Exodus from Egypt during the days of the Mashiach? Does not it say: “Therefore behold, the days are coming, the word of Hashem, and they will not say anymore, as lives Hashem, who has brought the Children of Israel from the land of Egypt. But rather, [they will say], as lives Hashem who has brought and who will bring the seed of the House of Israel from the Northern land and from all the lands to which I have pushed them there, and they will dwell in their land?” (Jeremiah 23:7-8) They said to him, “It does not [mean] that the Exodus from Egypt will be uprooted from them, but rather that Egypt will be added to the [other] kingdoms. [Other] kingdoms will be the main [subject], and Egypt will be a secondary [subject]. Similarly [it says], your name will not be called anymore, Yakov, but rather Yisrael will be your name. (Genesis, 35:10) [It does] not [mean] that [the name] Yakov was completely uprooted from him, but rather [the name] Yakov was added to [the name] Yisrael. Yisrael was the main [name], and Yakov was the secondary [name].”
Similar to this [it says]: “Do not remember what happened in the past…” (Isaiah 43:18-19) “Do not remember what happened in the past:” this is [referring to] the burden of the kingdoms [of Persia, Greece and Rome]. “… and do not think about what happened in the days of old:” this is [referring to] the burden of Egypt. “Behold, I am going to do something new, now it will spring forward. Don’t you know about it?” this is [referring to] the war of Gog. They (i.e. the Rabbis) have said a parable to what this is similar to. [This is similar] to a person who came upon a wolf and was saved from him. Then he was telling [everybody about] the incident with the wolf. Then he came upon a lion and was saved from him. He forgot the incident with the wolf and was telling [everybody about] the incident with the lion. Then he came upon a snake and was saved from it. He forgot the incidents of both of them (i.e. the wolf and the lion) and was telling [everybody about] the incident with the snake. So to the Jewish People, the recent troubles make them forget about previous [troubles]....
Similar to this [it says]: “Sarai, your wife, will not be called Sarai anymore, because her [new] name is Sarah.” (Genesis 17:15) In the beginning, she was a princess over her nation, [but] now she became a princess for all of the nations of the world, as it is said: “…because her [new] name is Sarah.” Similar to this [it says]: “And your name will not be called anymore Avram, but rather your name will be Avraham…” (Genesis 17:5) In the beginning, you were a father to Aram and now you will be a father to all people of the world, as it is said: “… because I have made you a father of a multitude of nations”.(ibid)
Even though [the Tanach] goes back and calls Avraham [(Genesis 17:5)], Avram [again], [(Nehemiah 9:7) and (I Chronicles 1:27)] it is in his praise and not in his shame. To Yehoshua [(Numbers 13:16)], Hoshea [again], [(Deuteronomy 32:44)] it is in his praise and not in his shame. He is [the same] Avram before [God] spoke to him, he is [the same] Avram after [God] spoke to him. He is [the same] Hoshea before he became great , he is [the same] Hoshea after he became great. Moshe, Moshe [(Exodus 2:3)]; Avraham, Avraham [Genesis 22:11)]; Yakov, Yakov [(Genesis 46:2)]; Shmuel, Shmuel [(I Samuel 3:10)]; [all of these double expressions] are expressions of love and encouragement. They are [the same people] before [God] spoke to them and they are [the same people] after [God] spoke to them. They are [the same people] before they became great, they are [the same people] after they became great.
Similar to this [it says]: “His Booth was in Shalem and His Shelter was in Tzion.” (Psalms 76:3) And what did the verse see to bring back to her (i.e. Jerusalem) [her] original name? Here it says: “Because this city has caused my anger and wrath, from the day that it was built until this day, it should be removed from my sight.” (Jeremiah 32:31) I would have thought it is in the heat even now? [However] this teaches us, “The mountain that God desired to dwell on.” (Psalms 68:17) Here it is in delight and desire; this teaches us that [God] forgave her her [self] destruction. From where [do we know] that the Shechina (God’s presence) will not return to it until it will be [just] a mountain [again as it was originally]? This teaches us, “His Booth was in Shalem and His Shelter was in Tzion.” We find that when it is complete it is called a mountain. But the Shechina will not return to it until it will become [just] a mountain, as it is said: “And Avraham called the name of that place ‘Hashem Yireh’ as it is [commonly] said today ’on the mountain Hashem appears’.” (Genesis 22:14) And it is said: “Remember Hashem the day [that] Jerusalem [was destroyed], [and take revenge on] the Edomites who said, Raze it. Raze it down to its foundation.” (Psalms 137:7) When [will the Shechina return to it]? When its foundations will be uprooted by those who say, “Raze it. Raze it down to its foundation.”

Chapter 2

One who reads Shema [in the morning], must mention the Exodus from Egypt in [the Beracha (blessing) after the Shema called,] Emet Veyatziv. Rebbi says, “He must [also] mention in it Kingship [of God].” Others say, “He must [also] mention in it the Plague of the Firstborn and the Splitting of the Sea.”
One who reads the Shema must have intent in his heart. Rebbi Achai says in the name of Rebbi Yehudah: “If he had intent in his heart in the first paragraph [of Shema], even though he did not have intent in his heart in the last (i.e. second) paragraph [of Shema], he fulfilled his obligation [of saying the Shema].”
One that reads the Shema backwards [i.e. out of order] does not fulfill his obligation [of saying the Shema]. And the same [applies] to Hallel, to prayer [of Shemoneh Esreh], and to the Megillah [of Esther].
One who was reading the Shema and made a mistake, and skipped in it one verse, [he] should not begin to read that verse by itself, but rather should go back to that verse and complete [the Shema, from that point on] until the end. And the same [applies] to Hallel, to prayer [of Shemoneh Esreh], and to the Megillah [of Esther]. One who entered a synagogue and found that [the congregation] has read half of it (i.e. the Shema) and [he] completed [the remaining half of the Shema] with them, [he] should not go back and read it (i.e. the Shema) from the beginning until that place, but rather [he] should begin from the beginning and complete it until the end. And the same [applies] to Hallel, to Tefillah (prayer) [of Shemoneh Esreh], and to the Megillah [of Esther].
One who reads the Shema and makes a mistake, and [he] does not know where he made the mistake, [he] should go back to the beginning of the [first] paragraph. If he made a mistake in the middle of a paragraph, he should go back to the beginning of [that] paragraph. If he made a mistake between the first [verse that mentions] writing and the second [verse that mentions] writing, he should go back to the first [verse that mentions] writing.
The writers of books [of the Tanach], of Tefillin (Phylacteries), and of Mezuzot interrupt [their work] to read the Shema, but do not interrupt [their work] for [the] prayer [of Shemoneh Esreh]. Rebbi says, “Just like they do not interrupt [their work] for [the] prayer of [Shemoneh Esreh], so too they do not interrupt [their work] to read the Shema.” Rebbi Chananya Ben Akavya says, “Just like they interrupt [their work] to read the Shema, so too they interrupt [their work] for [the] prayer [of Shmoneh Esreh].” Rebbi Elazar Bar Tzadok said, “When Rabban Gamliel and his Bet Din were in Yavneh, they were involved in the needs of the community and they did not interrupt [their work] in order not to lose [concentration] from their hearts.”
A carrier, even though his burden is on his shoulder, he may read [the Shema]. But while he is unloading [the burden] and loading [the burden] he should not read, because he is not paying attention [to what he is saying]. Either way [i.e. whether he is carrying or loading, or unloading], he should not pray [the Shemoneh Esreh] until he [completely] unloads [and can stand in one place without holding his load].
Workers [must] read [the Shema even while they are sitting] on top of a tree. And they [can] pray [Shmoneh Esreh] on top of an olive tree or on top of a fig tree. But [if they are on top of] all other trees, they [must] go down to pray [Shmoneh Esreh]. The owner of the house [must] go down regardless [what kind of tree he is on top of] and pray [Shmoneh Esreh]. Workers [must] read the Shema and say a Beracha (blessing) before it and after it. [When] they eat their bread they [must] say the Beracha before it and after it. And they [must] pray three times [a day] Shmoneh Esreh, but they do not go in front of the pulpit [to lead the congregation].
Best men and bridesmaids, and all [other] wedding attendees are exempt from [the] prayer [of Shmoneh Esreh] and from [putting on] Tefillin (Phylacteries), all seven days [of the wedding celebrations], but [they are] obligated in reading the Shema. Rebbi Shila says, “The groom is exempt [from saying the Shema, Shemoneh Esreh and putting on Tefillin], but the wedding attendees are obligated [in all of them].”
They have buried the dead [person] and lined up in a row. The [outer] row that sees the inner [row] is exempt [from saying the Shema] and the [outer] row that does not see the inner [row] is obligated [to say the Shema]. Rebbi Yehudah says, “If there is only one row there, then those who are standing there for the sake of honor [of the dead] are obligated [to say the Shema], [and those who are standing there] for the sake of the mourner are exempt [from saying the Shema].” [Later] they went down to eulogize [the dead person]. The people that see the inner row are exempt [from saying the Shema], and some say, “those who are behind them [are exempt as well].” And those that do not see the inner row are obligated [to say the Shema]. The one that says the eulogy and all of those who are involved in the eulogy stop [the eulogy] to read the Shema, but they do not stop [the eulogy] to pray [the Shmoneh Esreh]. It happened [once] that the Rabbis stopped [the eulogy] for the reading of the Shema and [the] prayer [of Shmoneh Esreh].
A man who had a seminal emission (Baal Keri) and is sick, if nine Kavs of water were poured on him, he may read [the Shema]. But he may not fulfill the obligation [of reading the Shema] for others until he dips himself in forty Seah [of water]. Rebbi Yehudah says, “Forty Seah no matter what."
Zavim, Zavot, Niddot, and women who gave birth are permitted to read the Torah and to learn Mishna, Midrash, laws, and Aggadot. And men who had a seminal emission (Baalei Keraim) are forbidden in all of them. Rebbi Yossi says, “He can learn the laws that he is familiar with, as long as he does not arrange the Mishna.”
“A man who had a seminal emission (Baal Keri) who does not have water to dip in may read the Shema, but he may not [read it loud enough so that he can] hear [himself talking] with his own ear, and does not say the Beracha (blessing) not before it and not after it.” [These are] the words of Rebbi Meir. And the Chachamim (Sages) say, ”He may read the Shema and he may [read it loud enough so that he can] hear [himself talking] with his own ear, and he says the Beracha [both] before it and after it.” Rebbi Meir said, “One time we were sitting in the Bet Midrash (Study Hall) in front of Rebbi Akiva and we were reading the Shema, but we were not saying it loud enough to be able to hear ourselves, because of one inquisitor who was standing by the door.” They (i.e. Chachamim) said [back] to him, “The time of danger is not a proof.”
One that was standing in the field naked or that was doing his work naked should cover himself with straw and with stubble or anything [else for that matter] and may read [the Shema]. Even though they (i.e. the Rabbis) said that it is not praiseworthy for a person to be sitting naked, because the Holy One Blessed Be He did not create man naked as it says, “I clothed him in a cloud and [made] mist his shroud.” (Job 38:9) “Clothed him in a cloud” that [refers to] the sack of the fetus, “and [made] mist his shroud” that [refers to] the placenta. [If] there was a wrap of cloth or of skin wrapped around his loins he may read [the Shema]. Either way he should not pray [Shmoneh Esreh] until he covers his heart.
A person should not put his head into his [own] lap and read the Shema [that way]. But if his underwear was belted on the inside [of his robe] it is permitted [to read the Shema with his head in his own lap].
Two people that were sleeping [naked] under one cover are not allowed to read the Shema. But rather [what they should do is as follows], this one should cover himself with his [own] cover and read [the Shema] and this one should cover himself with his [own] cover and read [the Shema]. But if his son or his daughter were little then it is allowed [to read the Shema if one is sleeping naked with them in the same bed].
[In order to say Shema or pray Shmoneh Esreh] a person must move away from the feces and urine of a small child who is capable of eating an olive size [piece of bread], four Amot. We only move away from [the feces] of a person and of a dog when skins are placed inside it (i.e. dog feces) [for processing].
[If] an [empty] vessel for excrement or a tub for urine is with him in the house, he should move away [from it] four Amot and read [the Shema]. [If it is] in front of his bed he should put any amount of water into it and read [the Shema], but if he did not [put water in it], he may not read [the Shema]. Rebbi Zakkai says, “If he put into it a Reviit of water he [may] read [the Shema], and if not, he [may] not read the Shema.” Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel says, “[If the vessel for excrement] is in front of the bed he [may] not read [the Shema], [but] if it is behind the bed he [may] read [the Shema].” Rebbi Shimon Ben Elazar says, “Even if the whole house is approximately ten Amot [long] and the vessel for excrement is put inside it, he [may] not read [the Shema] until he takes it outside or puts it under the bed.”
A person should not go into dirty alleyways and read the Shema [there]. And not only that, but even if he already walked into [a dirty alleyway] while he was reading [the Shema], he should stop [reading it] until he completely exits from that area, and [only then] he [may continue] reading [the Shema]. A person should not stand and pray [Shmoneh Esreh] while he needs to relieve himself, as it is said, “Prepare to greet your God, Yisrael.” (Amos 4:12)
[A person] should not spill water [with feces in it] in a place where he [wants to] pray [Shemoneh Esreh], but rather he should [spill it] four Amot away [from that place]. If [the feces have] dried up or reabsorbed (i.e. dissolved) then it is permitted [to pray Shmoneh Esreh next to them].
[A person] who enters a bathhouse: In a place where people are standing dressed, it is [permitted] there [to] read [the Shema], and [say the] prayer [of Shemoneh Esreh], and one does not even need to mention [that] greetings [are allowed there]. One can put on his Tefillin (Phylacteries) [there] and one does not even need to mention that he does not [need to] take his Tefillin off [there]. [In] a place where [some] people are standing dressed and [some people are standing] naked, it is [permitted] there [to say] greetings, but it is not [permitted] there [to] read the Shema and [say the] prayer [of Shemoneh Esreh], and one [does] not [have to] take off his Tefillin [there], but one may not put [his Tefillin] on [there] from the start. [In] a place where [all] people are standing naked, it is not [permitted to] greet there, and one does not even need to mention [that] reading [of the Shema], and prayer [of Shmoneh Esreh], and taking off his Tefillin [are all forbidden there], and one does not even need to mention that he may not put them on (i.e. Tefillin) [there as well].
Hillel Hazaken says, “Do not be afraid [being] naked, do not be afraid [being] dressed, do not be afraid [while] standing, do not be afraid [while] sitting, do not be afraid [when] laughing, do not be afraid [when] crying, as it is said, “There is time to cry and time to laugh.” (Ecclesiastes 3:4)

Chapter 3

Just like the Torah established a set time to read the Shema, so too the Sages established a set time for [the] prayer [of Shemoneh Esreh]. Why did they say [that] the morning prayer [of Shmoneh Esreh can be prayed only] until noon? Because the morning Tamid (daily offering) [sacrifice] could be brought [only] until noon. Rebbi Yehudah says, “[The morning prayer of Shmoneh Esreh can be prayed only] until [the end of the first] four hours [of the day].” And why did they say that the Mincha (afternoon) prayer [of Shemoneh Esreh can only be prayed] until the evening? Because the afternoon Tamid [sacrifice] could be brought [only] until the evening. Rebbi Yehudah says, “[The Mincha prayer of Shmoneh Esreh can be prayed only] until Plag Hamincha.” And when is Plag Hamincha? Eleven minus one quarter hours [of the day] (i.e. 10 ¾ hours). And why did they say that the evening prayer [of Shmoneh Esreh] does not have a set time? Because the limbs and fats [of the sacrifices] could be brought the whole night. And why did they say that the Mussaf prayer [of Shmoneh Esreh can be prayed] the whole day? Because the Mussaf (additional offering) sacrifice could be brought the whole day. Rebbi Yehudah says, “[The Mussaf prayer can be prayed] until [the end of the first] seven hours [of the day].”
...The evening prayer [of Shmoneh Esreh] does not have a set time. Rebbi Elazar Bar Yossi says, “[A person should pray the evening Shmoneh Esreh] with the closing of the gates [of the Bet Hamikdash (Temple)].” Rebbi Elazar Bar Yossi said, “My father [always] prayed [the evening Shmoneh Esreh] with the closing of the gates [of the Bet Hamikdash].” [A person] who prays the Mussaf prayer [of Shmoneh Esreh] either after the morning Tamid [sacrifice] has been brought or before the morning Tamid [sacrifice] has been brought, has fulfilled his obligation [of praying the morning Shmoneh Esreh on time.]
Rebbi Yehudah says, “If a person is fluent with his prayer it is a good sign for him, and if he is not fluent with his prayer it is a bad sign for him.”
He used to say, “Whoever people like, God likes him, and whoever people do not like, God does not like him. Whoever likes his own deeds it is a good sign for him. Whoever does not like his own deeds it is a bad sign for him.”
Ben Azzai says, “Anyone whose body was stricken [with some decease], because of his wisdom it is a good sign for him. [And] anyone whose wisdom was stricken [with some decease], because of his body it is a bad sign for him.” He used to say, “Anyone who lost his mind, because of his wisdom it is a good sign for him. And anyone who lost his wisdom because of his mind it is a bad sign for him.”
[A person] who prays [Shmoneh Esreh] must pay attention [to the meaning of the words]. Abba Shaul says, “There is a reference for [the need of attention in] prayer [in the Tanach], ‘Prepare their hearts, pay attention.’ “ (Psalms 10:17)
Rebbi Yehudah said, “When Rebbi Akiva would pray [Shmoneh Esreh] together with the congregation he would finish faster than everyone else. When he would pray by himself a person would leave him on one side [of the room] and when he would come back he would find him on a different side [of the room], because of all of the bending of the knees and bowing that he would do.”
I would have thought that a person can pray [Shemoneh Esreh] all day long. [However] it explains in Daniel, “… and three times a day he prayed on his knees …” (Daniel 6:11) I would have thought that [a person] can pray facing any direction he wants. [However] the verse teaches us, “… where in the attic he had windows facing Yerushalayim …” (ibid.) I would have thought that [Daniel] only began to pray after he was exiled. [However] the verse teaches us, “… just as he had always done.” (ibid.)
I would have thought that [a person] should pray [Shmoneh Esreh] in a loud voice. [However] it explains by Chana, “and Chana was talking in her heart…” (I Samuel 1:13) I would have thought [a person] may pray all [three Shmoneh Esreh] in one shot. [However] it explains by David, “Evening, and morning, and afternoon…” (Psalms 55:18) Evening that is the Maariv prayer, morning that is the Shacharit prayer, and afternoon that is the Mincha prayer. I would have thought that [first a person] should ask for his [personal] needs and then he [should] pray [the established text of Shmoneh Esreh] and go away [from standing in front of God]. [However] it explains by Shlomo, “… to hear the song and the prayer …” (I Kings 8:28) Song that is the song,4 prayer that is the request. And so it says, “Sing before Hashem…” (Psalms 33:1)
We do not say anything [personal] after [the Beracha (blessing) of] Emet Veyatziv. But we do say [personal] things after [the] prayer [of Shmoneh Esreh], even if it is [as long as] the confession (Vidui) of Yom Kippur.
[If a person] was walking in a dangerous place or [where there are] robbers [present and it came the time to pray Shmoneh Esreh] he [should] pray a short prayer [of Shmoneh Esreh instead of the regular Shmoneh Esreh]. What is a short prayer [of Shmoneh Esreh]? Rebbi Elazar says, “Do Your will in heaven above, and give pleasure to those that fear you on earth, and do what is good in your eyes. Blessed the One that hears prayer.” Rebbi Yossi says, “Hear the voice of the prayer of your nation Israel and fulfill their requests quickly. Blessed the One that hears prayer.” Rebbi Elazar Bar Tzadok says, “Hear the voice of the cry of your nation Israel and fulfill their requests quickly. Blessed the One that hears prayer.” Others say, “Your nation Israel has many needs, but they are short minded. May it be your will Hashem our God that You may give to each one all of his needs and to each creature so that they should not lack. Blessed the One that hears prayer.” Rebbi Elazar Bar Tzadok says, “My father used to pray a short prayer [of Shmoneh Esreh] on Shabbat nights: ‘And from your love Hashem our God that you love Your nation Israel, and from Your compassion, our King, that you had on the children of Your covenant, you have given us, Hashem our God, this great and holy Seventh day, with love.’” And over the cup [of Kiddush (sanctification)] he says, “Who has sanctified the day of Shabbat” and he does not seal off [the Beracha (blessing)].
[If one must choose to] honor the day [of the Sabbath with food] or to honor the night, the honor of the day precedes the honor of the night. If he only has one cup [of wine, he should use it on the] Kiddush (sanctification) [of the night, since it] precedes the honor of the day and the honor of the night. [On] Shabbat nights and [on] Yom Tov nights: there is Kiddush on them over a cup [of wine], and there is also a mentioning of the day in Birkat Hamazon (Grace After Meals). [On] Shabbat [day], Rosh Chodesh (New Month), Chol Hamoed (the intermediate days of Sukkot and Pesach), and Yom Tov [day]: there is on them the mentioning of the day in Birkat Hamazon but there is no Kiddush on them over the cup [of wine].
If he did not mention [God’s] power [to bring down] rain in [the Beracha (blessing) of] Techiyat Hametim (Resurrection of the Dead) and he did not ask for rain in Birkat Hashanim (The Blessing for the Year) he has to go back [to the beginning of Shmoneh Esreh]. If he did not say Havdalah in [the Beracha of] Chonen Hadaat (He Who Grants Wisdom) he can say it over the cup [of wine], but if he did not say it [over the cup of wine then] he has to go back to the beginning [of Shmoneh Esreh]. Rebbi Yossi says, “Even someone who did not mention the covenant in Birkat Haaretz (The Blessing for the Land of Israel) [of Birkat Hamazon (Grace After Meals)] has to go back [to the beginning of Birkat Hamazon]."
Any [holiday] on which there is no Mussaf [prayer] for example, Chanukah and Purim, on Shacharit and Mincha he prays [the Shmoneh Esreh with] eighteen [Berachot (blessings)] and he says [the paragraph] about the occasion in [the Beracha of] Hodaah (Thanks). And if he did not say [the paragraph] about the occasion, he does not have to go back [to the beginning of Shmoneh Esreh]. And any [holiday] which has on it [the] Mussaf [prayer], for example Rosh Chodesh (New Month), and Chol Hamoed (the intermediate days of Sukkot and Pesach), on Shacharit and Mincha10 he would pray [the prayer of Shmoneh Esreh with] eighteen [Berachot] and he says [the paragraph] about the holiness of the day11 in [the Beracha of] Avodah (Temple Service).12 Rebbi Eliezer says, “[he says the paragraph about the holiness of the day] in [the Beracha of] Hodaah, and if he did not say it then he has to go back [to the beginning of Shmoneh Esreh].” In [the] Mussaf [prayer] he prays [the Shmoneh Esreh consisting of] seven [Berachot] and he says [the paragraph about the] holiness of the day in the middle [Beracha]. [On] Shabbat that fell out on Rosh Chodesh or on Chol Hamoed, during Shacharit and during Mincha he prays [the Shmoneh Esreh prayer that consists of] seven [Berachot] and he says [the paragraph about the] occasion in [the Beracha of] Avodah. Rebbi Eliezer says, “[He says the paragraph about the holiness of the day] in [the Beracha of] Hodaah, and if he did not say it then he has to go back [to the beginning of Shmoneh Esreh].” In [the] Mussaf [prayer] he prays [the Shmoneh Esreh consisting of] seven [Berachot] and he says [the paragraph about the] holiness of the day in the middle [Beracha]. On Shabbat, on Yom Tov (Pesach, Shavuot and Sukkot), and on Yom Kippur] he prays [the Shmoneh Esreh consisting of] seven [Berachot] and he says [the paragraph about the] holiness of the day in the middle [Beracha]. Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel and Rebbi Yishmael the son of Rebbi Yochanan Ben Beroka say, “Any time that he is supposed to say seven [Berachot in Shmoneh Esreh] he says [the paragraph about the] holiness of the day in the middle [Beracha].”
[On] Yom Tov of Rosh Hashana which falls out to be on Shabbat, Bet Shamai say, “He prays ten [Berachot (blessings) in the Mussaf Shmoneh Esreh]. And he says [the Beracha] for Shabbat by itself and [the Beracha] for Yom Tov by itself, and he says [the Beracha] for Shabbat first.” And Bet Hillel say, “He prays nine [Berachot in the Mussaf Shmoneh Esreh].” [On any other] Yom Tov that falls out to be on Shabbat, Bet Shamai say, “He prays eight [Berachot in the Mussaf Shmoneh Esreh]. And he says [the Beracha] for Shabbat by itself and [the Beracha] for Yom Tov by itself, and he says [the Beracha] for Shabbat first.” And Bet Hillel say, “He prays seven [Berachot in the Mussaf Shmoneh Esreh]. He begins with [the Beracha about] Shabbat and ends with [the Beracha about] Shabbat and he says [the paragraph about] the holiness of the day in the middle [of the middle Beracha].” Rebbi Natan says, “He even seals [the middle Beracha with] Baruch [Ata Hashem] Mekadesh Hashabbat Veyisrael Vehazmanim (Blessed are You Hashem who sanctifies Shabbat, and Israel and the seasons).”
A blind person and someone who cannot recognize the directions, [should] direct their hearts towards God, and [only then] pray, as it is said, “And they should pray to Hashem…” (I Kings 8:44)4 Those that are standing outside of the Land of Israel [should] direct their hearts5 towards the Land of Israel, and [only then] pray, as it is said, “And those that pray to You by the way of their land…” (I Kings 8:48) Those that are standing in the Land of Israel [should] direct their hearts towards Yerushalayim, and [only then] pray, as it is said, “And they will pray to Hashem by the way of the city that You have chosen…” (I Kings 8:44) Those that are standing in Yerushalayim [should] direct their hearts towards Bet Hamikdash (Temple), as it is said, “…and they should pray towards this house.” (II Chronicles 6:32) Those that are standing inside the Bet Hamikdash [should] direct their hearts towards the Holy of Holies and [only then] pray, as it is said, “… they will pray towards this place.” (I Kings 8:30) It comes out that [all of those] standing in the north will be facing the south, [all of those] standing in the south will be facing the north, [all of those] standing in the east will be facing the west, [and all of those] standing in the west will be facing the east. And it will come out that all of the Jewish people will be praying towards one place.
A person should not stand on top of a bed, and not on top of a chair, and not on top of a bench, and not on top of [any] high place and pray [Shmoneh Esreh], because there are no high places in front of God, as it is said, “From the depth I called out to You Hashem.” (Psalms 130:1) [However,] if he was an elderly person or sick then it is permitted [to pray Shmoneh Esreh on top of a high place]
[If a person] was riding on top of a donkey [and it came time to pray Shmoneh Esreh], if there is someone there who can hold his donkey, he should get down and [only then] pray [Shemoneh Esreh], and if not [then] he [should] sit in his place [on the donkey] and pray [Shmoneh Esreh that way]. Rebbi says, “Either way he should pray [Shmoneh Esreh while sitting] in his place [on top of the donkey], as long as he will be paying attention.”
[If a person] woke up early to go on a journey, he [should] take the Shofar and blow it [at dawn], [or he should take] the Lulav and shake it [at dawn], [or he should take] the Megillah and read it [at dawn], [or he should] pray [Shemoneh Esreh at dawn], and when it will come time to read the Shema, he should read it [then]. [If] he woke up to [travel while] sitting in a coach or on a ship he should pray [Shemoneh Esreh first at dawn], and when it will come time to read the Shema he [should] read [it then]. Rebbi Shimon Ben Elazar says, “Either way, he [should] read the Shema [first] and [only then] pray [Shemoneh Esreh].”
[If a person] was standing and praying [Shemoneh Esreh] in a main road or on a plaza he may move [out of the way] for a donkey, or a donkey driver [who is walking behind a donkey], or a potter [who is selling pots], and he does not stop [his prayer of Shemoneh Esreh]. They said [a story] about Rebbi Chaninah Ben Dosa that [one day] he was standing and praying [Shemoneh Esreh]. [Suddenly] he was bitten by an Arod (snake), but he did not stop praying. [Later] his students went and found [the Arod] dead on top of [the opening to] his hole. They said, “Woe to the man who was bitten by an Arod, woe to an Arod who has bitten Ben Dosa.”
We do not stand up to pray [Shmoneh Esreh directly after], a regular conversation, or after laughter or after idle actions or after frivolous behavior, bur rather [only] after words of wisdom. And also a person should not leave his friend [directly] after a regular conversation, or after laughter, or after idle actions, or after frivolous behavior, but rather [only] after words of wisdom. Because that is what we find the early prophets did, that they finished their words with the words of praise and consolation.
[If a person is] writing God’s name, even if a [non-Jewish] king greets him, he should not answer him. [If] he was writing five or six God’s names [one after the other, then] he may answer a greeting after he finished one of them.
[In] a place where it is customary to say Birkat Aveilim (Blessing of the Mourners), [if the custom is to say] three [Berachot (blessings)], [then] they say three [Berachot]. [If the custom is to say] two [Berachot], [then] they say two [Berachot]. [If the custom is to say] one [Beracha], [then] they say one [Beracha]. [In] a place where it is customary to say Birkat Aveilim (Blessing of the Mourners), [if the custom is to say] three [Berachot] including the first one [on the subject of] Techiyat Hametim (Resurrection of the Dead) and he seals it off [by saying Baruch Ata Hashem] Mechayeh Hametim (Blessed are You Hashem Who resurrects the dead). The second [Beracha is on the subject of] Tanchumei Aveilim (Consolation of the Mourners), and he seals it off [by saying Baruch Ata Hashem] Menachem Amo Veiro (Blessed are You Hashem who consoles His nation and His city). The third [Beracha is said on the subject of] Gemilut Chasadim (Deeds of Kindness), and he does not seal it off.
[The person] who completes [the reading of the Torah] at the cemetery does not seal off [with the Beracha (blessing) after reading of the Torah].
Eighteen Berachot (blessings) that the Sages have established [for the prayer of Shemoneh Esreh have been established] corresponding to eighteen mentionings [of God’s name] that are in [the chapter of Tehillim that begins with] “Ascribe to God, children of princes…” (Tehillim 29) And [a person] should include [the Beracha against] the heretics into [the Beracha] for the Rabbinical Jews, and [the Beracha] for the converts into [the Beracha] for the elders, and [the Beracha] for [King] David into [the Beracha] for [the rebuilding of] Jerusalem. But if he said each one of them separately he has fulfilled his obligation [of praying Shemoneh Esreh].
We answer Amen after a Jew who makes a Beracha (blessing) and we do not answer Amen after a Samaritan who makes a Beracha unless he (i.e. we) hears the whole Beracha.

Chapter 4

A person should not taste anything until he makes a Beracha (blessing) [on it], as it is said, “To Hashem is the Earth and its fullness…” (Psalms 24:1) [A person] who receives pleasure from this world without a Beracha makes inappropriate use of sacred property, until all of the Mitzvot (commandments) [that must be done over this object] will permit it to him. A person should use his face, his hands and his feet only for the honor of his Creator, as it is said, “Every creation of Hashem is for His sake.” (Proverbs 16:4)
The Beracha (blessing) that is made on date honey, apple cider and vinegar made from autumn grapes is the same as the Beracha made on fish brine.
The Beracha (blessing) for undiluted wine is Borei Pri Haetz (Who created the fruit of the tree) and it (i.e. undiluted wine) can be used to wash hands. [If] he added water into it, [then] the Beracha on it [becomes] Borei Pri Hagafen (Who created the fruit of the vine) and it (i.e. diluted wine) cannot be used to wash hands. [These are] the words of Rebbi Eliezer. And the Chachamim (Sages) say, “Whether this one (i.e. undiluted wine) or that one (i.e. diluted wine), the Beracha on it is Borei Pri Hagafen and it cannot be used to wash hands.”
[If] they brought in front of him [different] types of desserts, the Beracha (blessing) that he makes on them is Borei Minei Kisnin (Who created different types of nibblings).
On seeds he says [the Beracha (blessing)] Borei Minei Zerayim (Who created different types of seeds), and on herbs he says [the Beracha] Borei Minei Deshaim (Who created different types of herbs), and on vegetables he says [the Beracha] Borei Pri Haadama (Who created the fruit of the ground). Rebbi Yehudah says “[on vegetables he makes the Beracha] Baruch Matzmiach Haadama Bidvaro (Blessed upon whose word the ground produces growths).” Rebbi Meir says, “even [if] he saw bread and he said ‘Blessed be the One Who created this bread, how nice this bread is,’ that is its Beracha. Even [if] he saw figs and he said ‘Blessed be the One Who created these figs, how nice they are,’ that is their Beracha.” Rebbi Yossi says, “Anyone who changes [the official text] of Berachot from what the Rabbis have coined, does not fulfill his obligation [of saying the Beracha].” Rebbi Yehudah says, “Any [type of food] that has been changed from its original form (like bread which used to be wheat or wine which used to be grapes), [if] he changed its Beracha [to the Beracha of the food in its original form], he has fulfilled his obligation [of saying the Beracha].”
[A person] that chews [raw] wheat kernels, says a Beracha (blessing) on them Borei Minei Zerayim (Who created different types of seeds). [If] he [ground them into flour and] baked them [into bread] and [then] cooked them (i.e. the bread) [in water], as long as the pieces [of bread] remain [intact], he says the Beracha on them Hamotzi Lechem Min Haaretz (Who brings forth bread from the earth) and he says [after eating these pieces] the Three Berachot (i.e. Birkat Hamazon (Grace After Meals)). [If] the pieces [of bread] do not remain [intact] he makes the Beracha on them Borei Minei Mezonot (Who created different types of foods) and he makes the Beracha after [eating] them is One out of Three (i.e. Al Hamichya (For the Sustenance)).
[A person] that chews [raw] rice [kernels], says a Beracha (blessing) on them Borei Minei Zerayim (Who created different types of seeds). [If] he [ground them into flour and] baked them [into rice bread] and [then] cooked them (i.e. the rice bread) [in water], even though the pieces [of the rice bread] remain [intact], he says the Beracha on them, Borei Minei Mezonot (Who created different types of foods), and he does not say any Beracha after them at all. This is the general rule: any [food] that [gets] the beginning [Beracha] Hamotzi Lechem Min Haaretz (Who brings forth bread from the earth), [gets] the Three Berachot (i.e. Birkat Hamazon (Grace After Meals)) after it.
What is the order of a meal? Guests come in and sit down on top of benches and on top of soft seats until all [guests] come in. [After] all [guests] came in, and they (i.e. the servants) have given them [water to wash] hands, every one of them washes one hand. [When] they (i.e. the servants) poured them a cup [of wine], each one [of the guests] makes a Beracha (blessing) [for the wine] himself. [When] they (i.e. the servants) brought them appetizers each one [of the guests] makes a Beracha [for the appetizers] himself. [After the guests] have gotten up [from their temporary seats, moved to the main eating hall] and reclined [on sofas], they [i.e. the servants] gave them [water to wash their] hands [again]. Even though he already washed one hand, [still] he [has to] wash both of his hands [again]. [After] they (i.e. the servants) poured them a cup [of wine again], even though he already made a Beracha on the first [cup of wine], he makes [another] Beracha on the second [cup of wine]. [After] they (i.e. the servants) brought in front of them [more] appetizers, even though he [already] made a Beracha on the first [set of appetizers], he makes a [new] Beracha on the second [set of appetizers], but [this time] one [person] makes a Beracha for all of them. [A person] who comes [late] after three appetizers [have been served] does not have permission to enter [the dining hall]. Rebbi Shimon Ben Gamliel says, “There was a great custom in Yerushalayim (Jerusalem). They (i.e. house owners) would hang a towel above the door. While the towel is hanging guests can come in. [After] the towel has been removed guests are not permitted to come in [anymore]. And there was another custom in Yerushalayim. They (i.e. house owners) would give over [the responsibility for] a meal to a butcher (i.e. a caterer). If something went wrong during the meal they would punish the butcher [monetarily]. Everything according to the honor of the owner (i.e. the host) and everything according to the honor of the guests.”
[This] law [has been taught in the laws] of a meal. [A person] who goes out [of the dining room] to relieve himself, [when he goes back to the table] he washes one hand. [A person who goes out of the dining room] to speak to his friend, and makes a [long] interruption [by talking for a long time, when he goes back to the table he] washes both of his hands. Where does he wash them? He comes [back to the table], sits down in his place, and washes [his hands]. And he returns the pitcher [with which he washed his hands to the waiter who shows it] to the [other] guests [who are sitting together with him in the dining room].
They (i.e. the students) have asked Ben Zoma, “What is the reason that when they (i.e. the servants) bring them (i.e. the guests) wine in the middle of the meal each person makes a Beracha (blessing) [over the wine] by himself?” He said to them, “Because the throat is not empty.” [If] they (i.e. the servants) brought in front of him rice and wine, he should make a Beracha on the rice and [with it] exempt the wine [from a Beracha]. [If the servants brought in front of him] a radish and an unripe date, he makes the Beracha on the radish and [with it] exempts the unripe date [from a Beracha]. [If the servants brought in front of him] a salty [dish] and a slice [of bread] he makes the Beracha on the salty [dish] and [with it] exempts the slice [of bread from a Beracha]. Rebbi Chaninah Ben Gamliel says, “Bread that comes before the main meal and bread that comes with the salty dish after the main meal, require a Beracha before them and after them.” Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel says, “Slices [of bread] are a big sign for the guests. As long as the guests see slices [of bread on the table] they know that something else will come after them (i.e. the slices of bread). [However once the guests see] a complete loaf [of bread], fish and legumes [on the table] they know that nothing else will come after that in the meal.”
We make a Beracha (blessing) on the better grain.2 How [does this work?] [If a person has] a whole [loaf of] fine white bread and a whole [loaf of] home-made bread, he makes the Beracha on the whole [loaf of] fine white bread.  [If a person has] a slice of fine white bread and a whole [loaf of] home-made bread, he makes the Beracha on the whole loaf of home-made bread. [If a person has] wheat bread and barley bread, he makes the Beracha on the wheat bread. [If a person has] a slice of wheat bread and a whole [loaf of] barley bread, he makes the Beracha on the slice of wheat bread. [If a person has] barley bread and spelt bread, he makes the Beracha on the barley bread. But is not spelt better than barley? But rather [the reason that he makes the Beracha on the barley bread is] that barley is one of the seven species [for which the Land of Israel is blessed] and spelt is not one of the seven species [for which the Land of Israel is blessed]. This is the general rule: Anything that is from the seven species [for which the Land of Israel is blessed] and is a type of grain, Rabban Gamliel says, “he says after [eating] it Three Berachot (i.e. Birkat Hamazon (Grace After Meals))”, and Chachamim (Sages) say, “[he makes after eating it] Beracha One out of the Three (i.e. Al Hamichya (For the Sustenance)).”
It happened [once] that Rabban Gamliel and the Elders2 were reclining [and eating] in Yericho (Jericho). They (i.e. the servants) brought in front of them dates, and they ate them. Rebbi Akiva jumped up and said after [eating them] the Beracha One out of the Three (i.e. Al Haetz (For the Tree)). Rabban Gamliel said to him, “Akiva! What is with you? You are sticking your head into the argument.” He said [back] to him, “Rebbi (My master)! You have taught us ‘to lean after the majority’ (Shemot 23:2). Even though that you say like this and your friends say like this, the law is like the words of the majority.”
Rebbi Yehudah says in the name of Rabban Gamliel, “Anything [made] from the seven species [for which the Land of Israel is blessed] and is not a type of grain or [it is made from] grain which has not been made into bread, Rabban Gamliel says, ‘[After eating it] he makes the Three Berachot (i.e. Birkat Hamazon (Grace After Meals))’ and the Chachamim (Sages) say, ‘[After eating it] he makes the Beracha One out of the Three (i.e. Al Hamichya (For the Sustenance) or Al Haetz (For the Tree) or Al Hagafen (For the Vine))’. And anything which is not from the seven species [for which the Land of Israel is blessed] and is not a type of grain, Rabban Gamliel says, ‘[After eating it] he makes Beracha One out of the Three’ and Chachamim say, ‘He does not make any Beracha [at all].’”
It happened [once] with Rebbi Tarfon, that he was sitting in the shade of a dovecote, on Shabbat, in the afternoon. They (i.e. the servants) brought in front of him a bucket of cold [water to drink]. Rebbi Tarfon said to his students, “[A person] who drinks water to quench his thirst, what Beracha does he say [before drinking the water]?” They said to him, “Teach us our master.” He said to them, “Borei Nefashot Vechesronan (Who Created Souls and Made Them Lack).” [Then] he said to them, “I will ask [you another question].” They said to him, “Teach us our master.” He said to them, “It says [in the Torah], ‘And they sat down to eat bread, and they lifted up their eyes, and they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, and their camels are carrying gum, balsam and resin, transporting them to Egypt.’ (Genesis 37:25) Is not it the way of the Arabs to [usually] carry bad smelling skins and tar? But rather [what happened was that God] placed that righteous man (i.e. Yosef) among favorable things. Is not this a Kal Vechomer (a derivation from minor to major)? Just like at the time when [God] is angry [at] the righteous [people, He still] has mercy on them, then at the time [of God’s] mercy, how much more so.”...
“Similar to this [it says], 'They (i.e. Mishael and Eltzafan) came forth and carried them (i.e. Nadav and Avihu) in their tunics outside of the camp…’ (Leviticus 10:5) Is not this a Kal Vechomer (a derivation from minor to major)? Just like at the time when [God] is angry [at] the righteous [people, He still] has mercy on them, then at the time [of God’s] mercy, how much more so. Similar to this [it says] ‘… the lion had not eaten the corpse and did not maul the donkey.’ (I Kings 13:28) Is not this a Kal Vechomer (a derivation from minor to major)? Just like at the time when [God] is angry [at] the righteous [people, He still] has mercy on them, then at the time [of God’s] mercy, how much more so.”
[Then] he (i.e. Rebbi Tarfon) said to them (i.e. his students), “I will ask [you another question].” They said to him, “Teach us our master.” He said to them, “Why did [the tribe of] Yehudah merited the kingship [of Israel]?” They said to him, “Because [Yehudah] admitted [that he impregnated] Tamar.” It happened [once] with four elders, that they were sitting in the gatehouse of Rebbi Yehoshua. [They were] Elazar Ben Matya, Chaninah Ben Chachinai, Shimon Ben Azzai, and Shimon Hateimani. And they were involved [in discussing] what Rebbi Tarfon taught to them, “Why did [the tribe of] Yehudah merited the kingship [of Israel]?” “Because [Yehudah] admitted [that he impregnated] Tamar.” They have added [another source to that explanation] on their own. “[It says in the book of Iyov], ‘… that which the wise related from their fathers and did not withhold. To them alone the earth was given…’ (Job 15:18-19)” He (i.e. Rebbi Tarfon) said to them (i.e. to the four elders), “Do they give reward for a transgression? But rather what is [the real] reason why [the tribe of] Yehudah merited the kingship of Israel?” [The four elders said back to Rebbi Tarfon,] “Because he (i.e. Yehudah) saved his brother (i.e. Yosef) from death, as it is said, ‘Yehudah said to his brothers, “What benefit [will we have] if we kill our brother?”’ (Genesis 37:26) and it is written, ‘Let us go and sell him to the Ishmaelites…’ (Genesis 37:27)”8 He (i.e. Rebbi Tarfon) said [back] to them (i.e. the four elders), “It is enough that [the act of] saving [him] should [serve] as forgiveness for the [act of] selling [him to the Ishmaelites]. But rather what is [the real] reason why [the tribe of] Yehudah merited the kingship of Israel?” [The four elders said back to Rebbi Tarfon,] “Because of [Yehudah’s] humility, as it is said, ‘And now your servant (i.e. Yehudah) will become a slave to my master (i.e. Yosef) instead of the boy (i.e. Binyamin).’ (Genesis 44:33) Also [the only reason that] Shaul merited the kingship [of Israel] was due to [his] humility, as it is said, ‘… may be my father will turn his attention away from the donkeys and will start to worry about us.’ (I Samuel 9:5) [Since Shaul said “us” and not “me”] he considered his servant as [important as] himself, but Shmuel did not do so, but rather [he said], ‘Your father stopped worrying about the donkeys and is worried about you, saying “What will happen to my son?”’ (I Samuel 10:2) And when he (i.e. Shaul) runs away from [accepting his newly appointed role of] leadership what does it say? ‘And they have asked God, “Is the man even here?” and God said, “Here he is hiding by the vessels.”’ (I Samuel 10:22)” He (i.e. Rebbi Tarfon) said [back] to them (i.e. the four elders), “Is not he (i.e. Yehudah) a cosigner? And in the end [it is the responsibility] of a cosigner to fulfill his pledge. But rather what is [the real] reason why [the tribe of] Yehudah merited the kingship of Israel?” They said to him, “Teach us our master.” He said to them, “[The reason the tribe of Yehudah merited the kingship of Israel is] because they sanctified God’s name on the sea. When [all of] the tribes came and stood by the sea, this one said, ‘I will go down [into the water first]’ and this one said, ‘I will go down [into the water first].’ The tribe of Yehudah jumped up and went in first and sanctified God’s name [by doing so]. And regarding that moment it says [in Tehillim], ‘Save me God, because the water is up to my soul.’ (Psalms 69:2) And it also says, ‘When Yisrael was going out of Egypt, the children of Yakov from the nation of a foreign tongue, Yehudah was His sanctifier…’ (Psalms 114:1-2) Since Yehudah sanctified God’s name on the sea, therefore ‘…Yisrael his subjects.’ (ibid.) ”
[If people got up from the place where they were eating and] left [the room, in order] to bring in the bride [into the dining room] and they left there (i.e. in the room where they were eating) an old person or even a sick person, they do not need to say the Beracha (blessing) after [the food, in order that they can leave the room]. And when they come back they do not need to say the Beracha before [the food that they are going to eat now]. [However, if] they did not leave there (i.e. in the room where they were eating) even an old person or a sick person they need to say the Beracha after [the food that they ate up to this point, so that they can leave the room]. And when they come back they need to make [a new] Beracha before [the food that they are going to eat now].
The owner of the house who was reclining and eating, [if suddenly] his friend called him [outside] to talk to him [right outside of his house], [and the person in the house came out of the house, he] does not need to make a Beracha (blessing) after [the food, so that he can leave the house]. And when he comes back [into the house to continue eating] he does not need to say the Beracha before [the food that he is going to eat now]. [However, if] he made a [big] interruption (i.e. his friend called him to go far away from his house) he needs to make the Beracha after [the food that he ate up to this point, before he can leave], and when he comes back [to continue eating] he needs to make a [new] Beracha before [the food that he is going to eat now].
Workers that are picking figs, or cutting dates, or harvesting olives, even though they keep interrupting [their work] and eating [the fruit that they are picking] over and over again, they do not need to say a Beracha after [eating the fruit each time] and when they go back [to eat the fruit again] they do not need to make a [new] Beracha before [eating the fruit]. [However, if] they made a [big] interruption (i.e. they walked away from the tree to do something) [then] they need to make a Beracha after [eating the fruit, before they walk away] and when they come back [to the tree to keep on working and meanwhile eat the fruit again] they need to make a Beracha before [they start eating the fruit again].

Chapter 5

“A person should not eat on Shabbat eve (i.e. Friday) from the afternoon and on in order that he will desire [to eat food] when Shabbat starts.” [These are] the words of Rebbi Yehudah. [However,] Rebbi Yossi says, “A person can continue eating [on Friday afternoon] until it gets dark.” “[If a person was eating on Friday afternoon and Shabbat started then he must] interrupt [his meal] because of Shabbat (i.e. in order to make Kiddush (sanctification) and start the Shabbat meal from scratch).” [These are] the words of Rebbi Yehudah. [However,] Rebbi Yossi says, “[If a person was eating on Friday afternoon then he] does not [have to] interrupt [his meal because of Shabbat]."
It happened [once] that Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel, Rebbi Yehudah and Rebbi Yossi we reclining [and eating] in Akko [on Friday afternoon], and the day was over (i.e. it became dark and Shabbat began). Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel said to Rebbi Yossi, “Let us stop [eating because of] Shabbat.” He said [back] to him, “Everyday you prefer my words in front of Yehudah, [and] now you prefer the words of Yehudah in front of me. ‘Do you also want to kidnap the queen with me in the house?’ (Esther 7:8)” He said [back] to him, “If so, let us not stop [eating because of Shabbat, because] may be [if our students will see us stopping] the Halacha (law) will be established for generations [like Rebbi Yehudah].” They (i.e. their students) [later] said that they (i.e. Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel, Rebbi Yehudah and Rebbi Yossi) did not move from there until they have established the Halacha like Rebbi Yossi.
“[If] guests have been reclining [and eating] by the owner of the house (i.e. a private person) and the day was over (i.e. Friday was over and Shabbat began), as soon as it gets dark they interrupt [their meal, say Birkat Hamazon (Grace After Meals) and go] to the Bet Midrash (Study Hall) [to pray]. [After that] they come back [from the Bet Midrash to the house], they (i.e. the servants) pour for them a cup [of wine and] they say over it Kiddush (Sanctification) of the day (i.e. Friday night Kiddush).” [These are] the words of Rebbi Yehudah. Rebbi Yossi says, “He continues eating [his Friday afternoon meal] from when it gets dark [and on].”
[When a person says Birkat Hamazon (Grace After Meals) on Friday night after interrupting the Friday afternoon meal,] they (i.e. the servants) pour for him the first cup [of wine] over which he says Birkat Hamazon [for the Friday afternoon meal], and mentions in [that] Birkat Hamazon [the paragraph] for Shabbat (i.e. Retzei Vehachlitzeinu (May it please You and give us rest)). On the second [cup of wine] he says Kiddush of the day (i.e. Friday night Kiddush).
What is the order of [the beds in the room used for] reclining [during eating]? At the time when there are [only] two beds, the [most] senior [person]4 reclines on top of the first [bed] and the second one to him [in seniority reclines] below him (i.e. his head is at the first person’s feet). And at the time when there are three beds, the [most] senior [person] reclines on top of the middle [bed], the second one to him [in seniority reclines] above him, [and] the third one to him [in seniority] reclines below him. [If there are more than three people, then] they get ordered in this way (i.e. in groups of three) and on.
What is the order [in which people] wash [their] hands [before starting the meal]? [If there were] less than five [people] they begin [washing their hands] from the [most] senior [person]. [If there were] five or more [people] they begin [washing their hands] from the [most] junior [person].
What is the order [in which the servants] pour the cup [of wine to the people eating]? In the middle of the meal, they (i.e. the servants) begin [pouring the wine] with the [most] senior [person]. After the meal, they (i.e. the servants) begin [pouring the wine] with the [person] who will lead [everyone] in the Birkat Hamazon (Grace After Meals). If [the person who was going to lead everyone in Birkat Hamazon] wanted to give honor to his Rebbi (teacher) or to someone who is greater than him [and have the servants pour his cup of wine first], he is allowed to do so.
Two [people who are eating together] have to wait for each other [to continue eating from their] dish (i.e. one of them cannot eat from the dish while the other one has paused from eating for some reason). [However] three [people who are eating together] do not have to wait [for one person who paused to continue eating from his dish]. [The person] who says the Beracha (blessing) [in the beginning of the meal over the bread for everyone], gets to take [the bread into his hand] first. If he (i.e the person who said the Beracha over the bread for everyone) wants to give the honor [of taking the first piece of bread into the hand] to his Rebbi (teacher) or to someone who is more senior than him, he is allowed to do so.
A person should not take a bite from a piece [of bread] and then put it back into the [common] dish [with bread], because of danger.
A person should not drink from a cup and then give it to his friend [to drink from], because people’s sensitivities are not the same.
One [person] who is serving to two [people] can eat together with them [without asking them for permission, because after he joins them they can say Zimun]. [However, if there are] three [people eating together], he cannot eat with them until they give him permission [to eat together with them, because they can already say Zimun without him].
If they (i.e. the people eating) were brought [by the servants] a sweet relish together with [other] food, he makes the Beracha (blessing) on the [other] food and exempts the sweet relish [from the requirement of saying a Beracha over it].
Rebbi Muna says in the name of Rebbi Yehudah, “Stuffed pastry [that was served] after the [main] meal, [but before Birkat Hamazon (Grace After Meals),] requires a Beracha (blessing) before it and after it.
Washing [hands] before [the meal] (Mayim Rishonim) is optional. [Washing hands] after [the meal] (Mayim Acharonim) is obligatory. [When he washes] Mayim Rishonim, if he wants to interrupt [the water flow over his hands and pour the water over them the second time] he may do so. [However, when he washes] Mayim Acharonim, if he wants to interrupt [the water flow over his hands and pour the water over them the second time] he may not do so, [but rather he must pour the whole cup of water over the hands in one shot].
Everyone is obligated in [saying] Birkat Hamazon (Grace After Meals), Kohanim (Priests), Leviim (Levites), and Yisraelim (Israelites, regular Jews), converts [to Judaism], freed [non-Jewish] slaves, Chalalim (Kohanim who have lost their priestly status), Natinim, Mamzerim (bastards), [a person] castrated by [a deliberate act of another] person, [a person who was] born castrated, [a person] with [one or both] testicles crushed, and [a person] with a cutoff member. All of them are obligated [in saying Birkat Hamazon] and they can absolve others (i.e. say it for others) of their obligation [of saying Birkat Hamazon]. A Tumtum (a person of unknown sex), and a hermaphrodite are obligated [in saying Birkat Hamazon], but they cannot absolve others (i.e. say it for others) of their obligation [of saying Birkat Hamazon].
A hermaphrodite can absolve his own kind (i.e. say it for another hermaphrodite) of his obligation [of saying Birkat Hamazon (Grace After Meals)], but he cannot absolve [another person] who is not his own kind (i.e. a man, a woman or a Tumtum (a person of unknown sex)). A Tumtum cannot absolve neither his own kind (i.e. say it for another Tumtum) of his obligation [of saying Birkat Hamazon], nor [another person] who is not his own kind (i.e. a man, a woman or a hermaphrodite).
[A person] who is half slave, half free person cannot absolve [another person of their obligation of saying Birkat Hamazon (Grace After Meals)], (i.e. say it for another person) not [if the other person is of] the same kind as him (i.e. a half slave, half free person), and not [if the other person is] not of the same kind as him (i.e. either a slave or a free person).
Women, slaves and children are exempt [from saying Birkat Hamazon (Grace After Meals)], and they cannot absolve many [people, who include men] from their obligation [of saying Birkat Hamazon]. In reality, they (i.e. the Rabbis) said that a woman can say [Birkat Hamazon] for her husband, a son can say [Birkat Hamazon] for his father, [and] a slave can say [Birkat Hamazon] for his master.
A child who is able to eat a Kezait (olive size piece) [of bread] is included into [a group of three people to say] the Zimun. And [a child] who is not able to eat a Kezait [of bread] is not included into [a group of three people to say] the Zimun. And we do not check the child [if he is really capable of eating a Kezait or not].
Regardless if [a person that is leading the Zimun] said Nevarech (Let us bless) or if he said Barchu (Bless) we do not stop him [and correct him] for this. [Only] cavilers stop [the leader] for this! [A group] of twenty [people] can split up [into two groups of ten people], as long as not even one person gets excluded from the Zimun.
Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel says, “[If after the guests] have gotten up [from their temporary seats, moved to the main eating hall] and reclined [on sofas], [a person] dipped together with them (i.e. other guests) [any piece of food into brine], even though he did not eat with them [even] a Kezait (olive size) of grain, they can include him [into their group] to say Zimun.”
[If] a Non-Jew says a blessing [for anything] using God’s name we answer after him Amen [even if we did not hear the whole blessing]. [If] a Samaritan says a blessing [for anything] using God’s name we do not answer after him Amen until we hear the whole blessing.
[If a person] was sacrificing Menachot (Meal offerings) in Jerusalem, he says [the following Beracha (blessing) before bringing the Mincha (meal offering) sacrifices], Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Shehigiyanu Lazman Hazeh (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who has brought us to this time). When he [actually] sacrifices them (i.e. Menachot) he says [the following Beracha immediately before bringing the sacrifice], Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Asher Kideshanu Bemitzvotav Vetzivanu Lehakriv Menachot (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us to sacrifice Menachot). When he eats them (i.e. Menachot) he says [the following Beracha immediately before eating them], [Baruch Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Hamotzi Lechem Min Haaretz (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who brings forth bread from the earth). [If a person] was sacrificing Zevachim (animal offerings) in Jerusalem, he says [the following Beracha before bringing the Zevach sacrifices], Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Shehigiyanu Lazman Hazeh (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who has helped us reach this time). When he [actually] sacrifices them (i.e. Zevachim) he says [the following Beracha immediately before bringing the sacrifice], Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Asher Kideshanu Bemitzvotav Vetzivanu Lehakriv Zevachim (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us to sacrifice Zevachim). When he eats them (i.e. Zevachim) he says [the following Beracha immediately before eating them], Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Asher Kideshanu Bemitzvotav Vetzivanu Leechol Zevachim (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us to eat Zevachim).
Ten [people] that are going on the road, even though all of them are eating from the same loaf [of bread], each one of them makes the Beracha (blessing) [over the bread] by himself. [If a group of people] sat down to eat [together] even though each one of them is eating from his own loaf [of bread], one of them makes the Beracha [over the bread] for all of them.
Workers that were doing [work] by the owner of the house [when they have to say Birkat Hamazon (Grace After Meals)] they say [only] two Berachot (blessings) [instead of the four usual Berachot]. [The way they say Birkat Hamazon is as follows.] He (i.e. the worker) says the first Beracha [in the regular fashion]. [Then] he combines [the Beracha] of Jerusalem (i.e. the 3rd Beracha) with [the Beracha] of the land (i.e. the 2nd Beracha) [into one Beracha], and he seals it off with [the ending of the Beracha] of the land. If [the workers] were doing [the work] for him [and receiving] their meal [as pay, instead of money], or the owner of the house was saying the Birkat Hamazon for them [because he ate together with them, even if they were getting paid money for their work, then] they (i.e. the workers) say [all] four Berachot. [These are] the things during meals regarding which Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel argue. Bet Shammai say, “[When a person makes Kiddush on Friday night,] he says the Beracha for the day [first] and [only] after that he says the Beracha on the wine, because the day causes the wine to be brought out, and since the day already began, however the wine has not been brought out yet [until later that evening].” And Bet Hillel say, “[When a person makes Kiddush on Friday night,] he says the Beracha for the wine [first] and [only] after that he says the Beracha on the day, because it is the wine that causes the holiness of the day to be discussed. [Besides this there is] another explanation. The Beracha for the wine is common and the Beracha for the [Shabbat] day is not common.” And the law follows the words of Bet Hillel.
Bet Shammai say, “We wash hands [before the meal] first, and [only] after that we pour the cup [of wine for Kiddush, because] may be the liquid outside of the cup will become Tameh (ritually impure), because of the [Tameh] hands, and in turn it will make the cup Tameh.” And Bet Hillel say, “The outside of the cup is always Tameh, [so therefore it does not matter if the liquid on the outside of the cup will make it Tameh.] [Besides this there is] another explanation. Hands should be washed as close to the meal as possible.”
We pour the cup [of wine, for Kiddush, first] and [only] after that wash hands [before the meal]. ((Because if you say that we wash first, then may be the water that is on the hands will become Tameh, because of the cup [which is Tameh] and it will go back and make the hands Tameh. But rather [we must say that] we pour the cup [of wine for Kiddush] and [only] then wash hands [before the meal].))
Bet Shammai say, “[After washing the hands before the meal, a person] wipes his hands with a cloth napkin and puts it down on the table [so that he can use it during the meal to wipe himself], [because if he will put it on the cushion instead] may be the liquid inside the cloth napkin will become Tameh (ritually impure) because of the cushion, and it will revert and make his hands Tameh [when he touches the cloth napkin again].” [And] Bet Hillel say, “[In case of] a doubt [if the] liquid [touches his] hands [or not, the hands remain] Tahor (ritually pure).” [Besides this there is] another explanation. Hands do not [need to be] washed [by Torah law, when eating] Chulin (ordinary food that does not have any special holiness to it). But rather [instead of putting the cloth napkin on the table, he should wash his hands and then] wipe his hands with a cloth napkin and put it on the cushion [so that he can use it during the meal to wipe himself], [because if he will put it on the table instead] may be the liquid inside the cloth napkin will become Tameh because of the table and it will revert and make the food Tameh [when the cloth napkin touches the food].
Bet Shammai say, “[After the meal is over] we sweep the house [in order to clean up the bread crumbs that fell on the floor], in order to [prevent] the destruction of food, and [only] after that we wash hands [after the meal].” And Bet Hillel say, “If there is a waiter there, who is a Talmid Chacham (a Torah scholar), who picks up [all of] the crumbs that are the size of a Kezait (olive size), [then first] we wash hands [after the meal] and [only] then we sweep the house [from the crumbs].”
[If a person was brought by the waiter wine and perfumed oil at the end of the meal,] Bet Shammai say, “He should hold the cup of wine in his right hand and perfumed oil in his left hand. [Then] he should say the Beracha (blessing) on the wine, and after that [he should make the Beracha] on the oil.” And Bet Hillel say, “He should hold the perfumed oil in his right hand and the cup of wine in his left hand. [Then] he should say a Beracha on the oil and smear it onto the head of the waiter, [if the waiter was in fact an Am Haaretz (a person uneducated in Torah law). However,] if the waiter was a Talmid Chacham (Torah Scholar) [then] he should smear it onto the wall, because it is not praiseworthy for a Talmid Chacham to go out perfumed.”
Rebbi Yehudah said, “[If a person is eating a meal on Saturday night before the end of Shabbat and now he is done eating and has to say Birkat Hamazon (Grace After Meals) and Havdalah,] Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel do not argue about Birkat Hamazon which should be [said] first and Havdalah which should be [said] last. [So] what do they argue about? About the [order of the Berachot (blessings)] on [seeing] the light [of fire] and on [smelling] the spices [in Havdalah itself]. Bet Shammai say [first he makes the Beracha on seeing the] fire and [only] after that [he makes the Beracha on smelling the] spices, and Bet Hillel say [first he makes the Beracha on smelling the] spices and [only] after that [he makes the Beracha on seeing] the light [of fire].”
[A person] who comes home on Motzaei Shabbat (Saturday night) says a Beracha (blessing) on the wine, and on [seeing] the light [of fire], and on [smelling] the spices, and [then] he says [the Beracha] of Havdalah [itself, as a part of the Havdalah procedure]. And if he only has one cup of wine, he should leave it for after the [end of] the meal, and he says all of the [four Berachot of Havdalah] in order after [he finishes saying Birkat Hamazon (Grace After Meals)]. And [in general] he says Havdalah [on the following days:] on Motzaei Shabbat (Saturday night), on Motzaei Yom Tov (Evening at the conclusion of Yom Tov), Motzaei Yom Kippur (Evening at the conclusion of Yom Kippur), on Motzaei Shabbat which falls out on Yom Tov, and on Motzaei Yom Tov which falls out on Chol Hamoed (intermediate days of Pesach and Sukkot). [A person] who is used to [saying Havdalah] says many proclamations of separation [in the final Beracha of Havdalah itself] and [a person] who is not used to [saying Havdalah] says [only] one or two [proclamations of separation in the final Beracha of Havdalah itself].
[If people were sitting together on Motzaei Shabbat (Saturday night)] in the Bet Hamidrash (study hall for learning Torah) [and they had to say Havdalah], Bet Shammai say, “One [person] should say the Berachot (blessings) [of the whole procedure of Havdalah] for all of them.” And Bet Hillel say, “Every person should say the Berachot [of the whole procedure of Havdalah] for himself.”
[If it was time to make Havdalah and a person] had a candle that was hidden in its case or inside a lantern. [If] he [can] see the flame [of the candle], but he [can] not use its light, [or] he [can] use its light, but he [can] not see the flame [of the candle, then] he should not say a Beracha (blessing) [on seeing the light of the fire], until he [can] see the flame [of the candle] and he [can] use its light.
[If it was time to make Havdalah and a person had] a glass ball [candle holder with a candle burning inside it], even though it was not put out [since when it was lit before Shabbat, the person] can still say a Beracha (blessing) [on seeing the light of the fire] on it. We do not say a Beracha [on seeing the light of the fire during Havdalah] on a candle of Non-Jews. [However, if] a Jew lit [a candle] from [another candle] of a Non-Jew or a Non-Jew lit [a candle] from [another candle] of a Jew, [then] we do say a Beracha [on seeing the light of the fire during Havdalah] on it. From when do we say a Beracha on it? From when it gets dark. [If a person] did not say a Beracha [on seeing the light of the fire during Havdalah] when it got dark, he can still say [that] Beracha the whole night [of Saturday night]. [If a person] did not say a Beracha [on seeing the light of the fire] the whole night [of Saturday night], he [can] not say the Beracha [on seeing the light of the fire] anymore.
Fire and mixtures [of animals] are not [actually existent] from the six days of creation, but they are considered to be [as if they are existent] from six days of creation. Rebbi Yossi says, “The fire of hell was created on the second day [of creation] and will never be extinguished, as it is said, ‘And they will go out and see the corpses of men who rebelled against Me, because their worms will not die and their fire will not be extinguished, and they will be loathsome to all mankind.’” (Isaiah 66:24) We do not say a Beracha (blessing) [on seeing the light of the fire and on smelling the spices during Havdalah] on the fire and spices of a bathhouse.
[If a person] was standing in a store [that sells] spices all day [long], he only says the Beracha (blessing) [on smelling spices] once [in the beginning]. [But if] he was going in and out [of the store all the time, then] he says a Beracha [on smelling the spices] each time [he goes back inside the store].

Chapter 6

The Beracha (blessing) of Zimun is from the Torah (i.e. a Torah obligation) as it is said, “And you should eat, and be satisfied, and bless…” (Deuteronomy 8:10), this is [a reference to] the Beracha of Zimun. “… Hashem, your God …” (Deuteronomy 8:10), this is [a reference to] the first Beracha [of Birkat Hamazon (Grace After Meals)]. “… for the land …” (Deuteronomy 8:10), this is [a reference to] the Beracha about the land (i.e. the second Beracha) [of Birkat Hamazon]. “… the good …” (Deuteronomy 8:10), this is [a reference to the Beracha about] Jerusalem (i.e. the third Beracha) [of Birkat Hamazon] as it is said “… this good mountain and Levanon.” (Deuteronomy 3:25). “… which He has given you.” (Deuteronomy 8:10), this is [a reference to the Beracha of] Hatov Vehameitiv (The Good and Who does good) (i.e. the fourth Beracha) [of Birkat Hamazon].
From where [do we know] that just like you have to say a Beracha (blessing) after [eating food] you also have to say a Beracha before [eating food]? The Torah teaches us, “… which He has given you” (Deuteronomy 8:10), [meaning] from the moment that He gave [the food] to you, [you have to say a Beracha on it.] From where [do we know] that [you have to say a Beracha] even on [seeing] mountains and hills? The Torah teaches us, “… for the land …” (Deuteronomy 8:10). From where [do we know] that [you have to say a Beracha] even on [studying and reading] the Torah and on [performing] Mitzvot (commandments)? The Torah teaches us, “… which He has given you” (Deuteronomy 8:10), and it says, “… and I will give you the tablets of stone …” (Exodus 24:12).
Rebbi Meir says, “From where [do we know] that just like you have to bless [God] for good [things that happen to you], so too you have to bless [God] for bad [things that happen to you]? The Torah teaches us, ‘… that which Hashem, your God, has given you …’ (Deuteronomy 26:11). “Your God” [meaning] “your Judge”. For every judgment that He judges you, whether positively or negatively.”
[A person] who sees an idol says [the following Beracha (blessing):] Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Erech Apayim (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who is merciful). [If a person sees] a place from where an idol was uprooted, he says [the following Beracha:] Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Sheakar Avodah Zarah Meartzeinu. Yehi Ratzon Milfanecha, Hashem Eloheinu, Sheteaker Avodah Zarah Meartzeinu Umikol Mekomot Yisrael, Vetashiv Lev Ovdeihem Leavdecha (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, who uprooted an idol from our land. May it be Your will, Hashem our God, that [all] idol worship will be uprooted from our land and from all places where Jews [live], and may You return the heart of their worshipers to Your worship.).
[A person] who sees large crowds2 [of people] should say [the following Beracha (blessing):] Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Chacham Harazim (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who is wise [to know] secrets), because their faces are not similar to each other and their minds are not similar to each other. When Ben Zoma saw large crowds [of people] on the Temple Mount he said, “Blessed be the One who created all of these [people] to serve me. How much the first man toiled before he tasted [even] one mouthful? He planted [grain], ploughed, reaped, bound sheaves, threshed, winnowed, selected, ground, sifted, kneaded, and baked, and [only] after that [he] ate [bread]. And I stand up in the morning and I find all of these [foods] in front of me [already prepared].” How much the first man toiled before he wore a shirt? He sheared [wool], washed, combed, dyed, spun, wove, and sewed, and [only] after that he wore [clothes]. And I stand up in the morning and I find all of these [clothes] in front of me [already made]. How many skilled laborers are anxious to wake up [early to sell their goods], and I stand up in the morning and I find all of these [goods] in front of me [already made].” And also Ben Zoma used to say, “What does a good guest say? ‘May the host be remembered for good! How many different types of wine he brought in front of us? How many different pieces [of meat] he brought in front of us? How many different types of fine white bread he brought in front of us? Everything that he did, he did only for me.’ But what does a bad guest say? And what did I eat of his? I ate [only] one bread of his. I ate [only] one piece [of meat] of his. I drank only one cup [of wine] of his. Everything that he did, he did only for his wife and children.’” And so also it says, “Remember this so that you may extol His work that people have witnessed.” (Job 36:24)
[A person] that sees a black [person], a Borek, a redhead [person], an albino [person], a hunchback [person], a midget, a deaf [person], a mentally retarded [person], and a drunk [person] says [the following Beracha (blessing):] Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Meshane Habriyot (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who changes creatures). [A person that sees] a cripple [person], a lame [person], a blind [person], and a [person] afflicted with boils, says [the following Beracha:] Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Dayan Haemet (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, the true Judge)
[A person] that sees beautiful people and beautiful trees says [the following Beracha (blessing):] Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Mi Shekacha Lo Beriot Naot (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who has such beautiful creations [in His world]).
[A person] that sees a rainbow in the cloud says [the following Beracha (blessing):] Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Neeman Bevrito Zocher Habrit (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who is trustworthy in His covenant [and] remembers the covenant).
[A person] that was walking in the cemetery says [the following Beracha (blessing):] Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Yodeah Mispar Kulchem. Hu Atid Ladun Etchem Vehu Atid Lehakimchem Badin. Baruch [Ata Hashem] Neeman Bidvaro Mechayeh Hametim (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who knows the number of all of you. He will judge you and He will raise you up in judgment. Blessed are You Hashem, Who is trustworthy in His word [and] Who revives the dead).
[A person] that sees the sun, the moon, the planets and the constellations says [the following Beracha (blessing):] Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Oseh Bereishit (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who performs creation). Rebbi Yehudah says, “[If] a person says a Beracha on the sun, [he follows] a foreign way.” And also Rebbi Yehudah used to say, “[If a person] sees the sea constantly and [then suddenly] something changed in it, he needs to say a Beracha [on seeing the sea].”
Rebbi Meir used to say, ‘It says [in the Torah], “And you should love Hashem, your God, with all of your heart …” (Deuteronomy 6:5) [That means that you should love God] with both of your inclinations, with the good inclination and with the evil inclination. “… and with all of your soul …” (Deuteronomy 6:5) [That means that] even if He takes away your soul [you should still love Him]. And so also it says, “Because for Your sake we are killed all the time …” (Psalms 44:23) [But there is also] another explanation. “With all of your soul” [means] with the soul that He created within you, as it says “Let my soul live and I will praise You …” (Psalms 119:175) And [also] it says, “All my bones will say,’Hashem, Who is like You?”’ (Psalms 35:10)’ Ben Azzai says, “’With all of your soul’ [means that] you should give over your soul to [the performance] of the commandments.”
There are prayers that are frivolous. How so? [If a person] gathered one hundred Kor [of grain, and then] said [to God] “May it be Your will that there will be two hundred [Kor of grain]. [A person] obtained one hundred barrels [of wine and then] said [to God] “May it be Your will that there will be two hundred [barrels of wine].” All of this is a prayer in vain. But a person may pray that they (i.e. the grain or the barrels) should be blessed and not be cursed.
Rebbi Dostai Bar Yanai says in the name of Rebbi Meir, ‘It says [in the Torah] regarding Yitzchak “… and I will bless you and I will make your seed abundant for the sake of Avraham, My servant.” (Genesis 26:24) Yitzchak expounded and said, “A blessing only settles [on a person] through physical deeds.” [Then] he got up and he planted [seeds in the field], as it says, “And Yitzchak planted in that land, and he founded in that year Mea Shearim (literally: One Hundred Gates), and Hashem blessed him.” (Genesis 26:12) One hundred [is referring to] types [of seeds that Yitzchak planted. In that case why does the verse say] Mea Shearim (i.e. One Hundred Gates and not One Hundred Types of Seeds)? [Because the word Shearim is not referring to gates, but rather to measurements,] that they (i.e. Yitzchak’s workers) measured a hundred times [more than they planted]. It comes out [that] for every one [seed that they planted, they received back] a hundred [units of crops] according to what they measured.
[When a person] performs any Mitzvah (commandment) he has to say a Beracha (blessing) on it. [If a person] makes a Sukkah (booth) for himself he says [the following Beracha after completing it]: Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Shehigiyanu Lazman Hazeh (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who has helped us reach this time). [When a person] entered [the Sukkah] in order to dwell in it he says [the following Beracha]: Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Asher Kideshanu Bemitzvotav Vetzivanu Leishev Basukkah (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us to dwell in the Sukkah). And once he has said the Beracha on [dwelling in the Sukkah] on the first day [of the holiday of Sukkot] he does not need to say [this] Beracha anymore.
[If a person] makes a Lulav (date palm branch) for himself he says [the following Beracha (blessing) after completing it]: Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Shehigiyanu Lazman Hazeh (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who has helped us reach this time). When he takes it (i.e. the Lulav) [on the holiday of Sukkot] he says [the following Beracha]: Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Asher Kideshanu Bemitzvotav Vetzivanu Al Netilat Lulav (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us to take the Lulav). And he must say this Beracha [before taking] it all seven days [of Sukkot]. [If a person] makes [a garment] with Tzitzit (fringes) [on it] for himself he says [the following Beracha after completing it]: Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Shehigiyanu Lazman Hazeh (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who has helped us reach this time). When he wraps himself in it he says [the following Beracha]: Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Asher Kideshanu Bemitzvotav Vetzivanu Lehitatef Batzitzit (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us to wrap in Tzitzit). And he must say this Beracha [before he puts on the garment with Tzitzit] every day. [If a person] makes Tefillin (Phylacteries) for himself he says [the following Beracha after completing it]: Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Shehigiyanu Lazman Hazeh. When he puts it on he says [the following Beracha]: Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Asher Kideshanu Bemitzvotav Vetzivanu Lehaniach Tefillin (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us to put on Tefillin). When does he put them (i.e. Tefillin) on? In the morning. [If] he did not put them on in the morning he [can] put them on the whole day.
[Even if a person] slaughters [an animal] for himself he needs to say a Beracha (blessing) [in the form as if it was slaughtered for others]. He says [the following Beracha:] Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Asher Kideshanu Bemitzvotav Vetzivanu Al Hashechitah (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us regarding the slaughter). [Even if a person] covers blood [after slaughtering a wild animal or a bird] for himself he needs to say a Beracha [in the form as if the blood was covered for others]. He says [the following Beracha:] Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Asher Kideshanu Bemitzvotav Vetzivanu Al Kisui Hadam Beafar (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us regarding covering of the blood with dirt).
[If a person] circumcises [a baby boy for someone else] (i.e. not his own son) he needs to say a Beracha (blessing) for himself (i.e. for his act of circumcision) [even though it is the father who is obligated to circumcise his own son]. He says [the following Beracha:] Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Asher Kideshanu Bemitzvotav Vetzivanu Al Hamilah (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us regarding the circumcision). The father of the boy has to say a Beracha for himself [regardless if he is or is not the one who performed the circumcision].6 He says [the following Beracha:] Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Asher Kideshanu Bemitzvotav Vetzivanu Lehachniso Bivrito Shel Avraham Avinu (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us to bring him into the covenant of Avraham, our father). And the people who stand there [in the presence of the circumcision] say [in response to the father’s Beracha:] Keshem Shehichnisato Lebrit Kach Tachnisehu Letorah Ulechupah Ulemaasim Tovim (Just like you have brought him to the circumcision so too may you bring him to the Torah, to the Chupah (Wedding Canopy) and to [performing] good deeds). [The person] who says the Beracha [over the ceremony of the circumcision] says [the following Beracha: Baruch Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Asher Kidesh Yedid Mibeten, Vechok Besheiro Sam, Vetzeetzaav Chatam Beot Berit Kodesh. Al Ken Bischar Zot, El Chai Chelkeinu Tzureinu Tziva Lehatzil Yedidot Sheereinu Mishachat. Baruch [Ata Hashem] Koret Haberit (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who has sanctified the beloved one from the womb, and placed the mark of the law on his descendant, and sealed his offspring with the sign of the holy covenant. Therefore, as a reward for this, The Living God, Our Portion, Our Rock, command to save the beloved people of our remnant from destruction. Blessed are You Hashem, Who establishes the covenant).
[A person] who circumcises converts [to Judaism for their conversion] says [the following Beracha (blessing): Baruch Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam Asher Kideshanu] Bemitzvotav Vetzivanu {Al Hamilah (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us regarding the circumcision). [The person] who says the Beracha [over the ceremony of the circumcision of converts] says [the following Beracha:] Baruch Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam Asher Kideshanu] Bemitzvotav Vetzivanu} Lamul Et Hagerim {U}Lehatif Mehen Dam Brit Sheilmaleh Dam Brit Lo Nitkayem Shamayim Vaaretz Sheneemar Im Lo Briti Yomam Valailah [Chukot Shamaim Vaaretz Lo Samti]. Baruch [Ata Hashem] Koret Habrit (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us to circumcise converts and to draw from them the blood of the covenant, because if not for the blood of the covenant heaven and earth would not exist as it is said, “If not for My covenant day and night I would not upkeep the laws of heaven and earth.” (Jeremiah 33:25) Blessed are You Hashem, Who establishes the covenant). [A person] who circumcises slaves [when they get bought by a Jew] says [the following Beracha:] Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam Asher Kideshanu Bemitzvotav Vetzivanu] Al Hamilah (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us regarding the circumcision). [The person] who says the Beracha [over the ceremony of the circumcision of slaves] says [the following Beracha:] Baruch Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam Asher Kideshanu] Bemitzvotav Vetzivanu Lamol Et Haavadim {U}Lehatif Mehen Dam Brit Sheilmaleh Dam Brit Lo Nitkayem Shamayim Vaaretz Sheneemar Im Lo Briti Yomam Valailah [Chukot Shamaim Vaaretz Lo Samti]. Baruch [Ata Hashem] Koret Habrit (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us to circumcise slaves and to draw from them the blood of the covenant, because if not for the blood of the covenant heaven and earth would not exist as it is said, “If not for My covenant day and night I would not upkeep the laws of heaven and earth.” (Jeremiah 33:25) Blessed are You Hashem, Who establishes the covenant).
[A person] who was walking to separate Terumah (heave-offering) and Maaserot (tithes) says [the following Beracha (blessing) before he arrived to do the separation]: Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Shehigiyanu Lazman Hazeh (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who has brought us to this time). As he separates them he says [the following Beracha]: Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Asher Kideshanu Bemitzvotav Vetzivanu Lehafrish Terumah Umaasrot (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us to separate Terumah and Maaserot). When does he say the Beracha on them (i.e. Terumah and Maaserot)? At the time that he separates them.
[If] ten [people] were doing ten [different] Mitzvot (commandments) [while being together, then] each [person] says a Beracha (blessing) [on each Mitzvah (commandment)] for himself. [If] all of them were doing one Mitzvah [together, then] one [person] says [one] Beracha [on that Mitzvah] for everyone. One [person] that was doing ten [different] Mitzvot says a [separate] Beracha on each [Mitzvah]. One [person] that was doing one Mitzvah the whole day [without interruption] only says one Beracha [on it, in the beginning]. [However, if] he was stopping [in the middle of the performance of the Mitzvah] and then doing it [again] he says a [new] Beracha on each [new performance of that Mitzvah].
[A person] who enters a city [should] pray two [prayers], one when he enters [the city] and one when he exits [the city]. Rebbi Shimon says, “[He should pray] four [prayers], two [prayers] when he enters [the city] and two [prayers] when he exits [the city].” What [prayer should] he say [right before] he enters [the city]? “May it be Your will, Hashem, my God, that You will bring me into this city in peace.” [After] he has entered [the city] in peace, he [should] say [the following prayer]: “I thank You, Hashem, My God, that You brought me in peace. May it be Your will, Hashem, my God, that You will take me out from this city in peace.” [After] he has exited [the city] in peace, he [should] say [the following prayer]: “I thank You, Hashem, my God, that you took me out in peace. May it be Your will, Hashem, my God, that You will [allow] me to reach my place [of residence] in peace.”
[A person] who enters into a bathhouse [should] pray two [prayers], one as he enters [the bathhouse] and one as he exits [the bathhouse]. As he enters [the bathhouse] he says [the following prayer]: May it be Your will, Hashem, my God, that you will bring me in peace and you will take me out in peace. And may there not happen with me a disaster. But if a disaster will happen to me may my death be a forgiveness for all of my sins. [However] save me from this and anything similar to it in the future. [If] he exited in peace he says [the following prayer]: I thank You, Hashem, my God, that you took me out in peace. So may it be Your will, Hashem, my God, that I will come to my place [of residence] in peace.
Rebbi Yehudah says, “A person is obligated to say [the following] three Berachot (blessings) every day: Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Shelo Asani Goy (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, for not making me a gentile), Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Shelo Asani Isha (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, for not making me a woman), Baruch [Ata Hashem Eloheinu Melech Haolam] Shelo Asani Bur (Blessed are You Hashem, our God, King of the world, for not making me a boor). [The reason for saying a Beracha for not making him] a gentile is because it says ‘All nations are like nothing to Him. He considers them to be empty and void.’ (Isaiah 40:17) [The reason for saying a Beracha for not making him] a woman is because women are not obligated in Mitzvot (commandments).” [The reason for saying a Beracha for not making him] a boor is because a boor is not afraid of sin. They have said a parable to what this is similar to. [It is similar] to a king of flesh and blood who said to his servant to cook him [some] food, but he (i.e. the servant) has never cooked food in his life. In the end he ruins the food and angers his master. [Or the king told the servant] to hem for him a robe, but he (i.e. the servant) has never hemmed a robe in his life. In the end he [causes] the robe to get dirty and angers his master.
A person should not enter the Temple Mount2 with money bundled in his cloak, and with dust on his feet, and with his money-belt tied on him on the outside as it is said, “Watch your feet when you go to the House of God …” (Ecclesiastes 4:17)
Rebbi Yossi Ben Rebbi Yehudah says, “It says [in the verse], ‘… because you cannot come into the gate of the king in sackcloth.’ (Esther 4:2) For sure there are many more Kal Vechomer (a derivation from minor to major) derivations in this case.” And spitting [is forbidden on the Temple Mount] from a Kal Vechomer. Even though a shoe has nothing disgraceful about it, [and still] the Torah says not to go with a shoe [on to the Temple Mount], it is a Kal Vechomer to spitting which is disgraceful, [that it should be for sure forbidden on the Temple Mount].
[A person] who begins [his Berachot (blessings)] with [God’s name that is represented by Hebrew letters] Yud Heh (i.e. Adonai) and ends [his Berachot] with [God’s name that is represented by Hebrew letters] Yud Heh (i.e. Adonai) is a wise person. [A person who begins his Berachot] with [God’s name that is represented by Hebrew letters] Aleph Lamed (i.e. El or Elohim), but ends [his Berachot] with [God’s name that is represented by Hebrew letters] Yud Heh (i.e. Adonai) is an average person. [A person who begins his Berachot] with [God’s name that is represented by Hebrew letters] Yud Heh (i.e. Adonai), but ends [his Berachot] with [God’s name that is represented by Hebrew letters] Aleph Lamed (i.e. El or Elohim) is a boor. [A person who begins his Berachot] with [God’s name that is represented by Hebrew letters] Aleph Lamed (i.e. El or Elohim), and ends [his Berachot] with [God’s name that is represented by Hebrew letters] Aleph Lamed (i.e. El or Elohim) follows a foreign way.
All endings of Berachot (blessings) that were [said] in the Bet Hamikdash (Temple) [included the phrase] Ad Haolam (until the [next] world). After the heretics became more virulent [and] they said that there is only one world, [the Rabbis] decreed that [in the Bet Hamikdash in the endings of Berachot] they should say Min Haolam Vead Haolam (from [this] world and until the [next] world). And [thus] they would let [everyone] know that this world in front of the World to Come is like a vestibule in front of the banquet hall.
[The people] do not answer Amen in the Bet Hamikdash (Temple) [after Berachot, but rather say instead Baruch Shem Kevod Malchuto Leolam Vaed (Blessed be His glorious Name forever and ever)]. And from where [do we know] that they do not answer Amen in the Bet Hamikdash? As it is said, “Get up, bless Hashem, your God, from the world until the world.” (Nehemiah 9:5) And it says, “And let them bless Your glorious name.” (ibid.) And from where [do we know that] for every single blessing and for every single praise [and not just at the conclusion of all blessings of Shemoneh Esreh, they say instead of Amen, Baruch Shem Kevod Malchuto Leolam Vaed]? The verse teaches us, “… and exalted beyond every blessing and praise.” (ibid.) [Meaning] for every single blessing and for every single praise [they say Baruch Shem Kevod Malchuto Leolam Vaed].
Originally, when the Torah would get forgotten from the Jewish people the elders would swallow it (i.e. the Torah) between themselves, [and not publicly teach it to the masses in great detail] as it is said, “And behold, Boaz was coming from Bet Lechem and he said to the harvesters, ‘Hashem is with you’. And they said to him, ‘May Hashem bless you.’” (Ruth 2:4) And [also] it says, “Hashem is with you, mighty warrior.” (Judges 6:12) And [also] it says, “… and do not scorn your mother when she has grown old.” (Proverbs 23:22)5 “It is time to do for Hashem, they have forsaken Your Torah.” (Psalms 119:126)
Hillel the Elder says, “At the time when they gather in you should spread, and at the time when they spread you should gather in.” At the time that you see that the Torah is beloved to all of the Jewish people and everyone rejoices in it, you should spread it (i.e. teach it) as it is said, “The one that spreads gathers in more ...” (Proverbs 11:24) And at the time that you see that the Torah is being forgotten from the Jewish people and no one is paying attention to it, gather it in (i.e. learn it privately to yourself and do not teach), as it is said, “It is time to do for Hashem, they have forsaken your Torah.” (Psalsms 119:126) Rebbi Meir says, “[If] they have forsaken your Torah, [then] it is time to do for Hashem [and teach the Torah to the masses even with more force than before].”
Rebbi Meir used to say, “There is not [even a] single person among the Jewish people who does not perform one hundred Mitzvot (commandments) every day. He reads the Shema, says Berachot (blessings) before it and after it, eats his bread and says the Berachot before it and after it, prays Shemoneh Esreh three times, and does all other commandments and says Berachot over them.” And also Rebbi Meir used to say, “There is not [even a] single person among the Jewish people whom the Mitzvot do not surround. Tefillin (Phylacteries) is on his head, and Tefillin is on his arm, and Mezuzah (scroll on the doorpost) is on his door, and the four Tzitzit (fringes) surround him. And regarding them (i.e. these seven commandments) David said, ‘Seven times per day I praise You for the laws of Your righteousness.’ (Psalms 119:164). And when he (i.e. David) entered the bathhouse and saw the circumcision on his flesh [he praised God further for the eighth commandment that is physically on him] as it is said, ‘For the conductor, for the eighth, a song of David.’ (Psalms 12:1) And it says, ‘Hashem’s angel camps around those who fear Him and delivers them.’ (Psalms 34:8).”
