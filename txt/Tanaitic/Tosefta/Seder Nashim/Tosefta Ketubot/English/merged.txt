Tosefta Ketubot



Chapter 1

Why did they say that a virgin was married on Wednesday? For if he had a virginity claim, he would get up early to go to court. If so, let her be married on Sunday! Rather, because they could attend to all their needs for as many days of the week as possible, they decreed that he should marry her on Wednesday. From the danger and onwards, they decreed that he should marry on Tuesday, and the Sages did not object to them. If he wants to get married on Monday, they do not listen to him. If it is because of factors beyond their control, it is allowed. Why do the groom and bride separate on the first Friday night? Because he would make a bruise [when causing her to lose her virginity, and it is forbidden to cause a wound on Shabbat]. Why did they say that a widow should be married on Thursday? Because, if he married her on Sunday, the rest of the week he would leave her and go back to work; they decreed that he should marry her on Thursday, in order that he should be idle for 3 days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday), and through these idle days, it would result in him being happy with her for 3 days.
An adult man that had sex with a minor woman, and a minor man who had sex with an adult woman or one who had lost their hymen through means other than sex (mukat etz), her ketubah is 200 zuz. They said in the name of Rabbi Yehudah ben Igra: Which is a minor woman and which is a minor man? A minor man is less than 9 years and 1 day; a minor woman is less than 3 years and 1 day. A man who marries (sic., נושא ונותן = do business with, doesn't make sense here) into the priesthood, and a woman who does, it is a decree that they decreed in court that an Israelite's daughter to a priest, a priest's daughter to an Israelite man—he gives 400 zuz. 
A typical man that married a deaf-mute or not sound of mind woman—their ketubah is 200 zuz since he wants to hold their property. A deaf-mute or not sound of mind man that marry a typical woman, even if the deaf-mute or not sound of mind man subsequently recover, they to not have a ketubah. If they want to uphold it, they give a ketubah of 100 zuz. A Gentile or a slave man that has sex with a Jewish woman, even if they subsequently convert or are freed, they do not have a ketubah. If they want to uphold it, they give a ketubah of 100 zuz. A Jewish man that has sex with a maidservant or Gentile woman, even if they subsequently convert or are freed, they do not have a ketubah. If he wants to uphold it, he gives a ketubah of 100 zuz.
An adult woman and a woman incapable of having children (aylonit)—their ketubah is 200. If she is married on the presumption that she was fit to bear children but it turned out that she was incapable, she has no ketubah. If he wants to uphold it, he gives a ketubah of 100 zuz.
A man who has sex with a woman who is deaf-mute, not of sound mind, an adult or lost her hymen through means other than sex (mukat etz)—they do not have a virginity claim. A blind woman or one incapable of having children (aylonit), they have a virginity claim. Sumkhus said in the name of Rabbi Meir: A blind woman does not have a virginity claim.
Said Rabbi Yehudah: In the old days in Judea, they used to investigate the groom and the bride for 3 days before the marriage; but in Galilee they did not do this. In the old days in Judea, they used to seclude the groom and the bride one moment before the marriage in order that he should desire her; but in Galilee they did not do this. In the old days in Judea, they used to set up two wedding guest guards, one from the groom's house and one from the bride's house (but even so they would only set them up for marriage); but in Galilee, they did not do this. In the old days in Judea, the wedding guest guards would sleep in the place where the groom and bride slept; but in Galilee they did not do this. Anyone who does not practice according to this [i.e. their appropriate, local] custom cannot claim a virginity claim.
[Translating from Lieberman over printed edition here:] If he took her in under the presumption that she was fit to have children but it turned out that she was unable to bear children (sic!, Lieberman corrects: under the presumption that she was a virgin but it turned out that she had had sex), even if she had secret contact [with a man that her husband had warned her not to be alone with, part of the legal process of declaring her a sotah] and there are witnesses that she was not secluded with him with enough time for sex, her second husband is not able to claim a virginity claim; therefore, her ketubah is only 100 zuz. Virginity claims have a time limit of 30 days—words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yose says: If she had secret contact [with a warned man], then [the claim can and should be brought] immediately; if she had no secret contact, then even after 30 days.
One who sent out a bad rumour [about his wife that she had an affair], and his witnesses turned out to be scheming—he is lashed and pays 400 zuz, and the schemers are advanced to the stoning house. If she is fatherless [so there is no father to pay the fine to]—he is lashed, her ketubah remains, he pays 400 zuz, and the schemers are advanced to the stoning house. If he didn't tell the witnesses to testify but rather they came and testified of their own accord—he is not lashed and he does not pay 400 zuz, but the schemers are advanced to the stoning house. If she whored when she was a youth, but once she became an adult he sent out a bad rumour, he is not lashed and he does not pay 400 zuz, but she and her scheming witnesses are advanced to the stoning house.
If she were pregnant and they said to her: "What is the nature of this foetus?", [and she said:] "It is from Ploni the kohen"—Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Eliezer say: She is believed since this is testimony that a woman is fit for. Rabbi Yehoshua says: She is not believed. Rabbi Yehoshua said to them: Do you not agree that, regarding a captive woman who was captured among the Gentiles, who has witnesses that she were captured, and she says "I am pure" that she is not believed!? They said to him: No! You would say this with a captive woman who has witnesses [that she was captured], can you say it about this one who has no witnesses [that she had a child with this man]!? He said to them: But what greater testimony is there than this, that her womb is between her teeth!? He said to them: There is no guardian for illicit sexual relations [i.e. women aren't expected to check the lineage of their sexual partners, so we have no idea if the father of the foetus is in fact pasul]. When does this apply [that a woman's testimony can be believed]? For testimony about her body [i.e. whether she can go onto marry a kohen or not], but with the child everyone agrees that he is a shetuki [a genealogical blemish belonging to someone whose father is unknown].

Chapter 2

Witnesses that said, "We testify about Ploni that he is a son of a divorcée" or "son of a halutzah (woman who was eligible for levirate marriage but went through the halitzah ceremony instead)", "a natin (descendant of a Canaanite Temple servant)", or "a bastard (mamzer)", [but] before their testimony was investigated in court, they said "We are liars"—behold they are believed. If after their testimony was investigated in court they said "We are liars", they are not believed. This is the rule of the matter: Witnesses that testify to declare something impure, pure, to distance, to bring closer, to forbid, to permit, to exempt, to obligate—if, before their testimony was examined in court they said "We are liars", they are believed; [but] if after their testimony was investigated in court they said "We are liars", they are not believed.
The legal power of a contract is stronger than that of witnesses [in some respects], and the legal power of witnesses is stronger than that of a contract [in other respects]. The power of a contract is stronger: a contract can remove a wife from her husband, which is not true of witnesses. The power of witnesses is stronger: witnesses that said "Ploni is dead", his wife can remarry; if "Ploni is dead" were written in a contract, his wife cannot remarry; if they said "What is written in this contract we heard but then forgot", his wife can remarry—a man who writes his testimony in a contract and testifies about it can continue to do so even after 100 years!
The legal power of a contract is greater than that of money [in some respects], and the legal power of money is greater than that of a contract [in other respects]. For a contract can [enable one to] collect from mortgaged property, which is not true of money. But the power of money is stronger: money can redeem arakhin (an item whose value is dedicated to the Temple), haramin (items dedicated to the Temple and/or doomed to destruction), sanctified items and second tithe, which is not true of a contract. The legal power of a contract and money is stronger than that of usucaption (hazakah, presumption of ownership) [in some respects], and the legl power of usucaption is stronger than that of contract and money [in other respects]. Usucaption is stronger: if he sold him 10 fields, when he possesses any one of them, he has acquired them all; but, if he payed him only the amount of one of them, or only wrote for him one of them [in the contract], he acquires only that field.
The 200 zuz for a virgin, 100 for a widow, nezek (damages for injury), half nezek, double payments (for stealing some kinds of property), four- and fivefold payments (for stealing other kinds of property)—all of them, even though they are not written in a contract, they are collected [even] from mortgaged property.
The wife who said, "I am married", but came back and said, "I am not married" is believed, since the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permitted. If she said: "I was captured but I am pure [i.e. did not have sex with her captives], and I have witnesses that I am pure!", they don't say: "Let's wait until the witnesses come and permit her", but rather permit her [to return to her husband or subsequently marry a kohen] immediately. If, after they permitted her, witnesses came and said, "She was captured", then she cannot remarry. (The next section is not in good manuscripts). If [the witnesses said] "She was captured and is impure", even if she had children, she has to leave the marriage. If one witness says "She was captured and is impure", [or] one witness says "She was captured and is pure", [or] a woman says "She was captured and is impure", [or] a woman says "She was captured and is pure"—all of these she should not be remarried; but if she does remarry, she shouldn't leave the marriage.
Two women who were captured—this one says, "I am impure but my fellow is pure" is believed. [If she says:] "I am pure but my fellow is impure" is not believed. "I and my fellow are impure" is believed about herself but not believed about her fellow. "I and my fellow are pure" is believed about her fellow but not believed about herself.
And similarly with two men—this one says, "My fellow is a kohen" and the other one says, "My fellow is a kohen"—they give to them [the priestly gifts]; but for priestly pedigree [i.e. to pass onto their children] they are not believed until there are 3 men, in order that 2 of them testify about the 3rd and the other 2 testify about the other 3rd. Rabbi Yehudah says: They don't even give them [the priestly gifts] until there are 2 to testify about this one and 2 to testify about this one. They raise someone to the priesthood, to being a Levite or an Israelite on the basis of one witness; but they do not lower someone except on the basis of 2 witnesses. Rabbi Yehudah says: Just as they don't lower someone except on the basis of 2, they don't raise except on the basis of 2.
Rabbi Lazar said: When [does this apply]? When there is a legal complaint in court [about the guy's status], but when there is no legal complaint in court, they raise to the priesthood on the basis of 1 witness. What constitutes a legal complaint? If they said: "How did Ploni jump into the priesthood?", "He never did the priestly blessing in shul", "He never took his priestly portion"—this is not a legal complaint. [If they said:] "He is son of a divorcée", "son of a halutzah", "a natin" or "a bastard"—this is a legal complaint. Rabbi raised [someone] to the priesthood based on 1 witness. Rabbi Yose raised [someone] to the priesthood based on 1 witness.
If rumour was spreading in town—Rabbi Yose says: Rumour is not evidence, rather anyone who has a valid legal complaint should come [to court] and say it. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Ha-Sgan: They raise [someone] to the priesthood based on 1 witness, and not even just 1 witness but even on the basis of a woman['s testimony]. And the woman doesn't even have to come to court, just when she said "They gave to him" [his priestly gifts, this off-hand comment is enough to raise someone to the priesthood].

Chapter 3

There are 2 grounds for presumption of being a priest in Eretz Yisrael: doing the priestly blessing and taking one's portion from the threshing floor. But in Suria and until the place that the Rosh Hodesh heralds arrive, doing the priestly blessing [is a ground for presumption] but not taking one's portion from the threshing floor. Bavel is like Suria. Rabbi Shimon ben Lazar says: Also in Alexandria originally, since there was a court there. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Just as terumah is a ground for presumption for being a priest when one takes it from the threshing floor, so too is first tithe a ground for presumption for being a Levite when one takes it from the threshing floor. One who takes his portion in a court does not have grounds for presumption to being a priest.
Everyone is believed to testify about her [see Lieberman: the wife of a priest in a captured city, who is presumed to have been raped, becomes forbidden to her husband; but if she has witnesses that she was not raped, she is believed and permitted to her husband]—even her son, even her daughter—except for her and her husband, for a person can't testify about themselves. Said Rabbi Zecharyah ben Ha-Katzav: By the Temple! [My wife's] hand did not leave from mine from the moment the Gentiles entered Jerusalem until they left—but even so, he designated for her a house for herself, she was sustained from his property, and she is not secluded with him except with her children.
A man is believed to say, "My father said to me that this family is impure"; "This family is pure"; "We ate in the ketzitzah of Plonit [see Lieberman: a ceremony for when one of the men married a woman who was not fitting for him]"; "Ploni's teacher said to him, 'Go and immerse your terumah!'"; or "We used to bring terumot and tithes to Ploni"—they are believed to give to him [his portion] but not as a grounds to presume he is a priest [for the purpose of passing on that status to his children]. But [if they testified] "Others used to bring to him [his portion]", they are not believed (although, Ehrfurt: they are believed). If [they testified] "He was a Gentile and converted", "A slave and he was freed"—then these are not believed. They are not believed to say, "I remember that Ploni owed Plonit (Ehrfurt: Ploni) a maneh"; or "Ploni's path went through Ploni's field" since this is like monetary cases. Rabbi Yohanan ben Berokah says: They are believed.
Said Rabbi Yohanan ben Berokah: A wife or minor is believed to say "From here the bee swarm left". When does this apply? When they are testifying right there. But if they go out and come back, they are not believed, since they only say this because of persuasion and fear [that people with power over them have instilled in them]. Men, wives, slaves and minors are believed to say "This place is impure" or "This place is pure".
Rabbi Yehudah says: A minor daughter of Israel who was captured, even if she is 10 years' old, she is in her holiness and her ketubah stands. A man who has sex with a deaf-mute woman, with an insane woman, with an adult woman and with a woman who lost her virginity not through sex (mukkat etz)—they do not have the fine [proscribed by the Torah]. A blind woman and a woman incapable of having children—they have the fine.
Rabbi Nehunya ben Ha-Kanah says: A man who has sex with his sister, with his paternal aunt, with his maternal aunt, with his wife's sister, with his brother's wife, with his uncle's wife, with a niddah—they do not have the fine [since he is liable for death]. And so too Rabbi Nehunya ben Ha-Kanah used to say: Yom Kippur is like Shabbat for monetary fines [on both, for many transgressions, he is exempt from monetary fines because he is liable for death or karet].
Whether a rapist or a seducer[—they pay the fine]. What is the difference between a rapist and a seducer? A rapist pays the pain payment, the seducer does not pay the pain payment. Rabbi Shimon says: Neither of them pay the pain payment because in the end she wants it. They said to him: One who has sex willingly is not similar to one who has sex unwillingly.
Even though they said a rapist pays immediately, when he takes [her] out [of the marriage after they got married as part of his punishment and he decided to divorce her], he pays nothing [for the ketubah]. Rabbi Yose bar Rabbi Yehudah says: He gives a ketubah of 100 zuz. Even though they said a seducer pays when he takes [her] out, he pays her shame and blemish payments immediately. What is the difference between paying immediately (for the rapist) and paying later (for the seducer)? If he pays immediately, if she dies, her father inherits it; if he pays later, if she dies, her husband inherits it [in other words, he sometimes won't have to pay since he could get the money back].
Both the rapist and the man who spread false rumours about his wife's virginity (motzi shem ra), if they divorce [her], they force him to return [her]. If they are priests [and so can't get remarried to someone they divorced], they are lashed with 40 lashes. Whether its the rapist or the seducer, either she or her father can prevent [the marriage], as it is said, "If objecting her father objects" (Shemot 22:16) [proving her father's consent is required] and it is said, "She will be for him a wife" (Shemot 22:19)—i.e. with her consent [as well]. For him you can force, but you can't force him to be a levir.
A minor girl from one day old until she brings forth two [pubic] hairs—she has [right of] sale [i.e. that her father can sell her into slavery] and has no fine [if she is raped etc.]—words of Rabbi Meir. For Rabbi Meir used to say: Anytime there is [the right of] sale, there is no fine; and any time there is a fine, there is no [right of] sale. But the Sages say: A minor girl from three years old and one day until she becomes an adult has a fine.

Chapter 4

The [legal] power of the husband is greater than the power of the father [in some respects] and the power of the father is greater than the power of the husband [in other respects]. The power of the husband is greater—for the husband can eat the fruit (i.e. can use the interest from her property) in her lifetime—which is not true for the father. The power of the father is stronger—for the husband is obligated in her food, in her redemption, her burial, and, in a place where they practice to do the funeral procession, to do the procession—which is not true for the father.
The [legal] power of a wife is greater than the power of a yevamah (one whose husband died with no children and now is in a legal bond with her former brother-in-law which either ends in marriage or halitzah) [in some respects], and the power of a yevamah is greater than the power of a wife [in other respects]. The power of a wife is stronger—for a wife eats terumah [if her husband is a kohen] as soon as she enters the bridal chamber, even before she has had sex—which is not true for the yevamah. The power of the yevamah is stronger—for a man who has sex with his yevamah (i.e. his dead brother's wife), whether intentionally or unintentionally, whether forced or willingly, even if she is in her father's house, he acquires [her as a wife]—which is not true of a wife [with whom a man would need to have sex with the purpose of betrothal].
If the father went with her agents or with the husband's agents, or the father's agents went with the husband's agents—if she had a courtyard on the road and she entered and slept in it, or if she entered the bridal chamber not for the purpose of marriage, and she died—even though her ketubah is with her husband [i.e. he is responsible for it], her father inherits it. The father handed her to the husband's agents, or the father's agents handed her to the father's agents—if she had a courtyard on the way and she entered and slept in it, or if she entered the bridal chamber for the sake of marriage and she died—even though her ketubah is with her father, her husband inherits it. When does this apply? With her ketubah, but regarding terumah, she cannot eat terumah until she enters the bridal chamber.
If [a wife] is captured, he is not required to redeem her. When does this apply? When she is a captive of the government, but if she is a captive of bandits he redeems her—if he wants to uphold it he can [and pay the bandits to redeem her], or else he divorces her and gives her a ketubah of 100 zuz. If she is captured after the death of her husband, her levirs are not required to redeem her. And that's not all—even if she were captured while her husband was alive and after that he died, the levirs are not required to redeem her.
If she is supported from his property and needs healing—this is like her [required] support [and the husband has to pay for it]. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Healing that has a fixed price is healed [i.e. paid for] from her ketubah; but without a fixed price—this is like her support. If there were years of drought and he said to her: Take your get and your ketubah, go and finance yourself—he is allowed.
If he did not write for her "Male children that you will have from me will inherit the money of your ketubah over and above their inheritance portions with their brothers" (ketubat banin dikhrin), he is obligated [to follow that procedure anyway], since it is a stipulation of the court. All lands write like the people of Jerusalem. (This seems to be a comment on Mishnah Ketubot 4:12, what is reported their to be Jerusalemite practice is here endorsed for everyone, that widows will be financed from the dead husband's estate for as long as they live there).
A man can marry a wife with the understanding that he will not feed her, with the understanding that he will not finance her. And not only this but he can decide with her that she will feed him, finance him and teach him Torah [by giving him the money so that he can not work and spend his time learning]. A case: Yehoshua son of Rabbi Akiva married a wife and decided with her [that they would be married] with the understanding that she would feed him, finance him and teach him Torah. There were years of famine. They began to dispute. She began to complain about him to the Sages. But when he came to court, he said to them: "She is more trustworthy to me than any man." She said to them: "Certainly, this is what he stipulated with me." The Sages said to her: "There is nothing after the agreement." [I.e. the original agreement stands].
Ideally, one should feed [his] daughters, and it is not necessary to say [also his] sons. Rabbi Yohanan ben Berokah says: It is required to feed daughters.
Hillel the Elder would explain lay-language [of contracts as if it were the biblical text]. When the people of Alexandria would betroth wives, another would come and seize her from the street. The matter came to the Sages. They sought to make their children bastards [since the betrothal was valid, so when they are married to others in the meantime their children will be illegitimate]. Hillel the Elder said to them: "Bring to me the ketubah of your mothers." They brought them for him, and it was written in it "When you enter my house, you will be my wife according to the law of Moshe and Yisrael" [in other words, based on a fine reading of the ketubah text, the betrothal only takes full effect when she enters his house, which means that the other husband was not illegitimate and her children aren't bastards].
Explained Rabbi Meir: One who receives a field from his fellow, and after he acquired it he neglected it, they evaluate it how much it was worth to do and pay him, for thus he writes to him [in the contract]: "If I neglect it and do not work it, I will pay with the best" [the derash being understanding "the best" as referring to do how much work would have appropriate for it to not go into disrepair].
Explained Rabbi Yehudah (sic!, printed edition is against all the manuscripts): A man can bring on behalf of his wife all the sacrifices that she is obligated in—even if she ate forbidden fat, even if she desecrated shabbat—for thus he writes to her [in the ketubah]: "The responsibility for you is upon me from now on" [and the derash includes even sacrifices that she would be responsible for]. If she gave him a receipt for some of her ketubah, she has given him a receipt for all of it, for thus she writes to him [in the receipt]: "My responsibility for you is upon me from now" [the derash being that all responsibilities have to cease, there is no giving a receipt for some of the ketubah and maintaining the rest].
Explained Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korhah: One who lends to his fellow, he should not give a pledge with him for more than his debt, for he writes to him [in the contract]: "Payment from property that I have, from property that I acquire from now" [the derash being that XXXX].
Explained Rabbi Yose Ha-Gelili: Anywhere they write (sic!, based on Ehrfurt) a loan into a ketubah (i.e. a combined document with aspects that are a loan, e.g. in the dowry, and other aspects that are a normal ketubah), he (sic!) can collect the lone but she (sic!, Ehrfurt has גובה in both instances) can't collect the ketubah. Anywhere they double the ketubah, she can only collect half. (This is my explanation—against everyone I have found!—trying to account for the simple meanings of the words in the Ehrfurt manuscript, which Robert Brody has shown to probably be the best text, but there is a LOT of confusion about this halakhah. See Lieberman and traditional commentators on Baba Metzia 104b for more details).
A son's father who became a guarantor for his daughter-in-law's ketubah—if the son has enough property, they collect from the son's [property]; but if not, they collect from the father's. If the father made a house or field as a mortgage for the ketubah of his daughter-in-law, whether [the son has enough property] or [not], they collect from [the house or field].
A man who went to the land beyond the sea, they said to him: Your son died. He began to write all of his property as a gift [to someone else], and afterwards it was known that his son was still alive—his gift stands. Rabbi Shimon ben Menasia says: His gift does not stand, for had he known that his son was alive he would not have done the gift. If he were ill and abed, and they said to him: "Your property is for whom?" He said to them: "I imagined that I would have had a son [by now], but now that I do not have a son, my property is for Ploni"—but afterwards it was known that he has a son, he said nothing. If he were ill and abed and they said to him: "Your property is for whom?" He said to them: "I imagined that my wife would be pregnant [by now], but now that my wife is not pregnant, my property is for Ploni"—but afterwards it was known that his wife is pregnant, he said nothing.
A convert that died and Jews divided up his property [if he has no children, since he has no legal connections to his Gentile family], but afterwards it was known that he had children or that his wife was pregnant—all of them [the Jews] are required to return [the property they took]. They returned everything, but his sons died or his wife miscarried, anyone who held possession [over his stuff] the second time keeps it, but from the first time does not.
Daughters—whether they were married before they became adults or became adults before they were married—they lose their food [i.e. the requirement of their father to feed them] but not their financial support. Rabbi Shimon ben Lazar says: They even lose their financial support. What should they do? They should rent [the property] to their husbands and collect their financial support [from the husbands].
Both property that has capacity for mortgage [i.e. real estate] and property that does not have capacity for mortgage [i.e. moveable property] can be collected from for a wife and daughters' sustenance—words of Rabbi. Rabbi Lazar bar Rabbi Shimon says: Property that has capacity for mortgage—sons can take it out of the hands of sons, daughters from the hands of daughters and daughters from the hands of sons, but not sons from the hands of daughters; property that does not have capacity for mortgage—sons can take it out of the hands of daughters, daughters out of the hands of daughters and sons out of the hands of daughters, but not daughters out of the hands of sons. Whether the father mortgaged something while he was alive or the inheritors mortgaged something after their father's death—they do not collect from them for the ketubah, but do collect from them for financial support.

Chapter 5

The adult woman is like (sic!) one claimed—they give her 12 months. If she were a minor, either she or her father is able to delay [the marriage until she is of majority age]. Rabbi Tarfon says: They give her everything terumah [if she is claimed by a priest and the time limit of 12 months is up and they are still not married, she eats entirely terumah]. When does this apply? From betrothal [i.e. when the claiming 12 months is up, she is betrothed but still not married], but from marriage, Rabbi Tarfon agrees that they give her half hullin and half terumah. When does this apply? With a kohen's daughter [married to a] kohen, but an Israelite's daughter to a kohen, everyone agrees they raise all of her food from hullin. Rabbi Yehudah ben Betera says: Two parts terumah and one hullin. Rabbi Yehudah says: She should sell the terumah and buy with its value hullin. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Any place where they [the sages] mention "terumah", he gives double hullin. This was the original mishnah. Our rabbis said: A wife who is an Israelite's daughter doesn't eat terumah until she enters the bridal chamber, and a yevamah doesn't [eat terumah] until she has sex [with her levir]. If her husband dies [after the time of claiming has passed], he inherits her. Said Rabbi Menahem ben Nafah in the name of Rabbi Liezer Ha-Kappar: A case, that Rabbi Tarfon who betrothed 300 wives for them to eat terumah, for they were years of famine. But Yohanan ben Bagbag already sent to Rabbi Yehudah ben Beterah to Netzivin, he said to him: I heard about you that you say a betrothed Israelite's daughter betrothed to a kohen can eat terumah. He replied to him and said to him: I had assumed that you were an expert in the chambers of Torah, but you don't know how to do a kal va-homer! Just as a Canaanite slavegirl, whose sex [with a kohen] does not acquire her to allow her to eat terumah, isn't it logical that money would acquire her to eat terumah!? But what can I do? For the Hakhamim said: A betrothed Israelite's daughter can't eat terumah until she enters the bridal chamber. If she dies, her father inherits her.
A yevamah—what is the law for her food? Any time a husband would be obligated [to provide her with food], the levirs are obligated; any time the husband would not be obligated, the levirs are not obligated. To whom does her handiwork belong? If she is fed from their [the levirs'] property, then they are theirs; but if not, then they belong to her. Her inheritance and her finding (sic!, inserted based on Ehrfurt manuscript) a lost object—whether [she is supported by the levirs] or not, they belong to her. One who makes his wife's handiwork hekdesh, he accounts from this handiwork what belongs to him and the rest is hekdesh.
The work that a wife does for her husband: they counted seven core types of work and the rest they didn't need to count. If she brought in for him [a slave], whther his or hers, she doesn't grind or launder (sic!, inserted based on Ehrfurt manuscript). He cannot (sic!, אין in Ehrfurt) force her to do [any of these types of work] for his son, her daughter, his brothers, her brothers or to feed the animals. A place where it is not the custom to do any one of these things, he cannot force her. Rabbi Yehudah says: He also can't force her to work with flax since it lacerates the mouth and stiffens the lips. If she vowed to not nurse her son, Beit Shammai say: Remove her breast from his mouth! But Beit Hillel say: He can force her to nurse; if she is divorced, they cannot force her to nurse; if [she is divorced but] her son recognises her, they pay her wages and she nurses him because of the danger [to the child since he may not accept breast milk from another woman]. A man cannot force his wife to nurse the son of his fellow, and a wife can't force her husband [to allow her to] nurse the son of her fellow.
One who vows from having sex with his wife, Beit Shammai say: [They can remain married] for 2 weeks, like the [period of impurity after the] birth of a female; Beit Hillel say: 1 week, like the birth of a male and like her menstrual period. More than that—he divorces her and pays the ketubah.
Workers [should have sex with their wives] twice a week. If they do work in a different town, once a week. Donkey drivers: once every 2 weeks. (The rest is missing in Ehrfurt manuscript).
One who rebels against her husband... (the rest is missing in Ehrfurt manuscript, but it likely is referring to Mishnah Ketubot 5:7 where this is discussed). This is the original mishnah. Our rabbis decreed that the court should warn her four (sic!) weeks one after the other once (sic!) a week. (Corrections based on Ehrfurt). More than that, even if her ketubah is 100 maneh, she loses it all—whether she is betrothed, married, waiting for her levir, a menstruant or sick.
A man who supports his wife through a third party, all of [the measurements of items he has to give her laid out in Mishnah Ketubot 5:8] have to be Italian measures, regardless whether she is a menstruant, sick or waiting for her levir [in other words: it doesn't matter her situation, the measurements are the same]. He has to give her a cup, barrel, pot, jug, lamp and wick. She doesn't get wine because wives of poor men don't drink wine. She doesn't get a mattress because the wives of poor men don't sleep on mattresses.
The additional food is his, but the additional rags are hers. A rich man—she goes up with him; but a poor man—she does not go down with him. A case: For the daughter of Nakdimon ben Gurion, the Hakhamim set up for her 500 golden dinars every day for her perfume fund and she was only waiting for her levir! She even made light of it and said to them: This is what you should give to your daughters! Said Rabbi Lazar bar Rabbi Tzadok: I will see in comfort if I saw (sic! correction based on Ehrfurt manuscript) her gathering barley from underneath the horses' hooves in Akko! I recited about her this verse: "If you did not know you, fairest of women!" (Shir Hashirim 1:8).

Chapter 6

A man who dies and leaves sons and daughters, when the property is large, the sons inherit and the daughters are fed and supported. How do the sons inherit? They [the court] don't say: "If their father were still alive, he would have given them X"—rather, they see each one as if he were their still living father [at the same social status], and pay them. How are the daughters fed and supported? They don't say: "If their father were still alive, he would have given them X"—rather, they see them as they are [now in social status] and so how much they need support, and pay them. Rabbi says: Each of [the daughters] takes a tenth of the property. Rabbi Yehudah says: If he married off his first daughter [with a certain dowry], he has to give to the second like what he gave to the first. They said to him: There are those who marry off their daughter and receive money, and those who marry off their daughter and pay after her money. And so Rabbi Yehudah used to say: One who marries off his daughter without explicit [stipulation of a dowry], he should not give her less than 5 selaim, for in the old days that was enough to buy for her everything she needs.
She agreed to bring in for him [in the dowry] 2 selaim (=4 dinarim), they become 6 dinarim [that he has to pay her back in the event of death or divorce, he has to compensate her +1/2 since he has had use of the dowry in the meantime; see Mishnah Ketubot 6:3]. Whatever the groom agrees [to bring in as his dowry in the ketubah], he puts it in at a value of -1/5, except for the 200 zuz for a virgin or 100 zuz for a non-virgin. (This is probably about evaluating the value of objects he brings in; see Mishnah Ketubot 6:3.) She agreed to bring in for him gold, the gold is like vessels [i.e. are evaluated, so have the -1/5 modification in the ketubah]; golden dinarim, the gold is like money [i.e. are not evaluated, so have the +1/2 modification in the ketubah]. Said Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel: And this is true for any place where the custom is not to exchange golden dinarim [for smaller currency], [but in a place where this is not true] they leave them the way they are and the gold is like vessels.
She brought in for him [in the dowry] either an evaluated item or money and he decides to divorce her, she can't say to him: "Pay me my [full] evaluation!" [without the change of -1/5 which is for the use of the item in the meantime, for here he never used it], and he can't say to her: "Take your money" [without adding the additional +1/2, for he never had access to this money], but rather she receives whatever she wrote for her.
She agreed to bring in for him money, each sela (=4 dinarim) becomes 6 dinarim [including +1/2 compensation for the use of the money in the meantime]. A groom accepts upon himself [responsibility] for 10 dinars for the perfume fund [for his wife]. (The word "per maneh" is not in the Ehrfurt manuscript.) Said Rabbi Yose: This is the halakhah, a place where the custom is to not reduce from the evaluation and not to add to money, they do not deviate from the local custom.
If she agreed to bring in for him 500 dinar of evaluated items, and he wrote for her 1000 dinar in her ketubah [even though he only owes her less than 500, after the modification, -1/5 according to Penei Moshe on the Yerushalmi's version of this baraita or -1/4 according to Lieberman, for the evaluated items], if a she made a fixed amount [i.e. the sum of 1000 was not explicitly in recompense for the evaluated items; see Penei Moshe, Yerushalmi Ketubot 6:4 / 30d], she receives whatever he wrote to her [the 1000 zuz]; but if not [i.e. the 1000 zuz was specifically marked as corresponding to the evaluated items], he reduces it by 3 (Ehrfurt manuscript: 6, Yerushalmi's version: 5) dinarim for each sela (=4 dinarim) [the point seems to be it is treated like evaluated items so she can only get the reduced value; but Ehrfurt perhaps thinks that it should be treated like money and he has to add +1/2]. If she agreed to bring in for him 500 silver dinarim and he wrote for her 1000 dinarim in her ketubah [which is again more than he needs to write], if she made a fixed price, she receives what she wrote for her; but if not, she reduces it 5 dinarim for each sela (Lieberman thinks this should be 6, to make it like money with +1/2). If she brought in for him 1000 dinar in her ketubah, and he wrote for her a field of 1200 zuz (so as to accommodate the future loss of -1/5), if she made a fixed price, she receives what he wrote for her; but if not, he should not reduce for a virgin less than 200 or a non-virgin less than 100.
One who marries off his daughter and agrees with his son-in-law that he should stand naked [in order to ensure that he is able to] dress her [i.e. that she has clothes to wear], they do not say: "He should stand naked and dress her", but rather he is covered as is appropriate for her. And so too when they marry off a fatherless girl, they should not reduce for her below 50 zuz; but if there is enough in the [charity] pocket (i.e. fund), they should finance her according to her honour.
A fatherless girl whose mother or brother married her off, and they wrote for her 100 or 50 zuz, even though the husband wrote for them "I have no legal claim with her", when she reaches majority age she is able to take from them what was appropriate to be given to her [i.e. the remainder of the 200 zuz]. A man can make agreements about his daughter['s marriage], but a wife can't make agreements about her daughter.
[If there is both] a fatherless boy and girl that want financial support, they should support the fatherless girl first and afterwards support the fatherless boy, because the boy is able to go around begging anywhere but the girl is not able to go around begging anywhere.
[If there is both] a fatherless boy and girl want to marry, they should marry off the fatherless girl first and then marry off the fatherless by since a woman's shame is greater than a man's. A fatherless boy that wants to marry, they should rent a house for him, lay out a bed for him, and afterwards marry him off to a wife, as it said, "Enough for whatever he lacks, לו" (Devarim 15:8): לו is a wife, as it is said there: "I will make לו, a helper for him" (Bereishit 2:18)—just as לו said there is a wife, so too לו said here is a wife. (The derash is you first give him whatever he lacks monetarily, then give him a wife based on the order of the verse).
A man who deposits coins for his son-in-law to purchase with them a field for his daughter, and she says "Let it be given to him [to do with whatever he wants]"—if she is betrothed, the trustee should do what was deposited with him [i.e. he has to buy the field]; if she is married, then she is allowed [to do this and the husband can do whatever he wants with the money]—words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yose says: If she was a minor, whether she is betrothed or married, the trustee should do what was deposited with him.
A man who says: "Give a shekel from my estate to my sons per week", but they are appropriate to receive a sela (=2 shekalim), they give to them a sela [since his intention was to give them enough per week, a shekel was a random amount]. But if he said: "Give them only a shekel", they only give them a shekel [since he was more specific]. If he said: "If they die, others should inherit me", whether he said "Give..." or "Give only...", they only give them a shekel [since there are others who stand to lose out if the sons get more money per week from the estate]. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Meir used to say: A man who says, "Give a shekel per week to my sons" and they are appropriate to receive a sela, they give them a shekel, and for the rest they are supported from tzedakah; but Hakhamim say: They are fed [from the estate] until they use up the estate, but for anything beyond that, they are supported from tzedakah.

Chapter 7

[A man who vows to abstain from benefitting from his wife] until 30 days, he should set up an officer [to look after his wife's affairs, and after that, if he hasn't released his vow, the marriage needs to end]; and with a priestly woman, 3 months—words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehudah (sic!, all the manuscripts have Yehudah): With an Israelite woman, for 1 month—he can uphold his vow; after 2 months—he sends her out and pays her ketubah; with a priestly woman, for 2 months—he can uphold; after 3 months—he sends her out and pays her ketubah (sic!, whole line translated from the manuscripts)
If he made her vow to not taste anything of any kind, whether bad or good food, even if she had never tasted that kind of thing in her life—he sends her out and pays her ketubah. Said Rabbi Yehudah: Daughters of Israel would rather not taste a cooked dish or fruits than to be one day out from under her husband.
If he made her vow to not adorn herself in with anything, even if she recently gave birth and vowed to not wear old clothes, even if she is old and vowed to not wear maternity clothes [i.e. even if the clothes she swore against wearing made no sense for her to wear]—he sends her out and pays her ketubah. Rabbi Yose says: If the couple is poor there is no limit [to how long she can keep this vow and remain married], but if the couple is rich, [the limit] is 30 days [after which he divorces her and pays her ketubah]. If he made her vow to not borrow a winnow, sieve, millstone or oven—he sends her out and pays her ketubah because she brings a bad name among her neighbours. If she herself vowed to not borrow a winnow, sieve, millstone or oven—she goes out without her ketubah because she brings a bad name among his neighbours.
If he made her vow that she shouldn't go to a funeral or a wedding, he sends her out and pays her ketubah, for tomorrow she will be lying dead and there will be nobody to care for her. Rabbi Meir used to say: [Whatever] you do, they will do for you; if you accompany [the corpse], they will accompany you[r corpse]; if you join the funeral procession, they will join your procession; if you bury, they will bury you. (Sic!, the Ehrfurt manuscript doesn't have the verse from Kohelet).
If he made her vow that she give her dish to taste to every man, or that she should fill [buckets] and pour [them] on a rubbish heap, or that she should say to every man things that are private to the couple—he sends her out and pays her ketubah since he did not act with her according to the custom of Moshe and Yisrael. And so too if she goes out with her head uncovered, with her shoulders (sic!, Ehrfurt manuscript has צדדיה over בגדיה) bared, or if she is too proud towards her slaves or her neighbours, if she spins [flax] in the street, if she washes in the bathhouse with every man—she goes out without her ketubah since she did not act with him according to the custom of Moshe and Yisrael. Rabbi Meir (sic!, manuscripts have Rabbi Meir) says: If he knows about her that he causes her to vow but she doesn't fulfil them, he should no longer vow about her. Rabbi Yehudah says: If he knows about her that she does not take out the hallah, he should fix it after her. Which is a kolanit (see Mishnah Ketubot 7:6)? Anyone who talks in her house and her neighbours hear her.
All of these women that transgressed custom need [a formal, legal] warning [in order to] go out without the ketubah. If they were not warned, he sends her out and pays her ketubah—and they don't need to [this about] say 200 for a virgin or 100 for a non-virgin [that of course if she leaves without her ketubah she doesn't get this money], but even more than this, even if her ketubah is 100 maneh, she can lose it all and receive only the rags that she can find in front of her.
A man who betroths a wife with the understanding that she has no [standing] vows [that she needs to fulfil], but it turns out that she does have vows—she is not betrothed. If she went to a sage who released her from the vow—then she is betrothed. If he brought her in[to his house, i.e. they got married] without stipulation [that she had or didn't have vows], and it turns out that she has vows—she goes out without her ketubah. If she went to sage who released the vow, then [the ketubah] would stand. [If he betrothed her] with the understanding that she has no physical defects [but it turns out that she does]—she is not betrothed. If she went to a doctor and he healed her—she is betrothed. If he brought her in without stipulation but it turns out that she does have defects, she goes out she is not betrothed; even though she went to the doctor and he healed her, she leaves without her ketubah. These are the vows they were talking about: E.g. she vowed to not eat meat, to not drink wine, or to not dress in dyed clothes.
All physical defects that make a priest unfit also make a wife unfit [i.e. if she didn't disclose them in the betrothal negotiations, she is not betrothed, see previous halakhah]. Wives have more [than priests]: [Also] smell of mouth, smell of sweat, and warts with no hair.
A man who says to his fellow: "Betroth to me your daughter with the understanding that she has no defects", and he said to him: "My daughter is sickly", [or] "She is insane", "She is epileptic", "She is dull-witted", "She has another defect" and he inserts it amongst [other] defects [that she does not have]—this is a mistaken purchase. [If he said,] "She has these defects and another one as well" [which he didn't specify]—this is not a mistaken purchase. Rabbi Meir concedes (sic!, text from Ehrfurt manuscript) [to Hakhamim, see Mishnah Ketubot 7:8] regarding defects that she was born with that, even though she is with her husband, her father needs to bring evidence [that she was born with them]. If he brought her in without stipulation and it turned she had defects and vows, the ketubah stands.
Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: If she were lame in one of legs or blind in one of her eyes, these are great defects and he sends her out and pays her ketubah. Which is a makmitz (from the list in Mishnah Ketubot 7:10)? A tanner, or others say one who gthers dung. Metzaref nehoshet? A smelter. Ba'al pholiphos (sic!, Rabbi Yose bar Rabbi Yehudah is attached to the next line in the Ehrfurt manuscript)? A smelly mouth.
Said Rabbi Yose bar Rabbi Yehudah (sic!, according to Ehrfurt manuscript): When do they say that he sends her out and pays her ketubah? When he wants to [stay married] but she doesn't want to, or when she wants to and he doesn't want to. If they both want to—the ketubah does not stand. A man afflicted with boils, even if they both want to, it does not stand. Said Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel: We found one elder afflicted with boils near Sepphoris, and he said to me: "There are 24 kinds of people afflicted with boils, and the only one of them for which [sex with a] woman is bad for him is ra'atan (a skin disease)."

Chapter 8

Said Rabbi Yehudah: They said before Rabban Gamliel: His betrothed is [called] "his wife" and his bride is [called] "his wife"—just as this one's [his bride's] sale [of her property] is void [without his permission], so to this one's [his betrothed's] sale is void. He said to them: With new property [that which came to her since she was married to him] we are ashamed [that he has control over it], but you would roll over us old property [that which came to her before she was married to him]!? Said Rabbi Hananya ben Akavya: This is not how Rabban Gamliel replied to them. Rather, he said thus to them: No! [Maybe] you can say [this] about a married woman, for whom he has the legal right to her found objects, her handiwork and to annul her vows, but can you say this about a betrothed woman for whom he had no legal rights to her found objects, her handiwork nor to annul her vows!?
They said to him [Rabban Gamliel]: What about property that fell to her before she was married and she was [subsequently] married [what rights does the husband have to her property]? He said to them: Even this she shouldn't sell, but if she sold it and gave it, it remains [valid]. They said to him: His betrothed is [called] "his wife" and his bride is [called] "his wife"—just as this one's [his bride's] sale [of her property] is void [without his permission], so to this one's [his betrothed's] sale is void. He said to them: With new property [that which came to her since she was married to him] we are ashamed [that he has control over it], but you would roll over us old property [that which came to her before she was married to him]!? But our rabbis returned and voted about property that fell to her before she was married and [then] was married, that if she sold it and gave it, it is void [without the husband's permission]. Rabbi Shimon distinguishes between two [kinds of] property: Property that is known to the husband, she shouldn't sell it, and if she sold it and gave it, [the sale] is void, for it is with this understanding that she was married; but property that is not known to the husband, she shouldn't sell it (Ehrfurt manuscript omits לא), and if she sold it and gave it, it stands.
A man who takes possession of his wife's property and [then] decides to divorce her, if he goes first and plucks any amount from the ground [i.e. uses up any amount of the property], behold he is rewarded by his haste [i.e. he gets to keep anything he "plucked"]. One who takes possession of the property of captives and hears about them that they are slowly approaching, if he goes first and plucks any amount from the ground, behold he is rewarded by his haste. This is the property of captives: Anyone whose father or brother or one of his inheritors went to the land beyond the sea, and he heard about them that they died, and he took possession of it as an inheritance [and he may get to keep what he takes]. This is the property of fugitives: Anyone who did not hear about them [his relatives that went to the land beyond the sea] that they died, but he took possession as an inheritance [but he won't get to keep what he took]. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: I heard that fugitives' [property] is the same as captives' [property, in that he gets to keep both, whatever he took]. One who took possession of the property of exiles, they take it from him.
And for all of the [kinds of property mentioned in the previous halakhah, if he has to return it], they evaluate [the amount the current owner is compensated for the property] as [if he were] a tenant (sic!, based on Tosefta manuscripts). These are the property of exiles: Anything where no one knows where it comes from.
A thief who took from this one and gave to that one—whatever he took is taken, whatever he gave is given. A robber who took from this one and gave to that one—whatever he took is taken, whatever he gave is given. If the Jordan [river] took from this one and gave to this one—whatever it took is taken, whatever it gave is given. If a river carried off trees, stones or beams from this one and gave [them] to this one—if the owner despaired [of getting this property back] then they are his [the finder's]; but if the owner is in pursuit after them, or they are in another place [and thus had no way to know that their property was carried off by the river], then they belong to the owner.
"One who writes his property to his son, he needs to write for him "From today and after my death"—words of Rabbi Yehudah." Rabbi Yoseh says: "He does not need to since the date in the contract proves it for him." Rabbi Yehudah said to him: "But doesn't the date in the contract only prove from the moment that it was written? One who writes his property to his son and returns and acquires different property, anything that wasn't included in the original gift—this now belongs to the inheritors [and follows the normal rules of inheritance, equal shares to everyone except a double portion for the firstborn, and overrides the gift]."
If the son sold [property written to him by his father for after his death] and (sic! according to Ehrfurt manuscript and most Rishonim, see Lieberman's notes) his father died, if there is property [still] attached to the ground [i.e. that the buyer has not used in the meantime], they evaluate for him [i.e. the property returns to the inheritors, but the buyer gets a certain amount of money as if he were a tenant, see end of this halakhah, also Lieberman and Tosefta Ketubot 8:4 above]. One who receives a field from his fellow [and then the original owner wants it back] which is an irrigated field or orchard [two types of field that are a lot of work to look after], if there is property attached to the ground, they evaluate for him [as a tenant]. One who receives a field from his fellow and the 7th year arrives, if there is property attached to the ground, they evaluate for him. (The following is not in the printed edition but supplied by Ehrfrut manuscript:) One who receives a field from his fellow and the time arrives when he has to leave, if there are [property] attached to the ground, they evaluate for him. And for all of these, they evaluate them as if he were a tenant.
One who takes possession of his fellow's ruin and builds it without permission, when he goes out and says, "Give me my wood and my stone!", they don't listen to him. (The following is defective in the printed edition, translating from the Ehrfurt manuscript:) Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Beit Shammai say: He is allowed to do this; Beit Hillel say: They don't listen to him. One who takes possession of his fellow's ruin and builds it without permission, they evaluate for him and he has the lower hand. With permission, they evaluate for him and he has the upper hand. In what way does he have the lower hand? If the profit is more than the expenses, he pays him the expenses; but if the expenses are more than the profit, he pays him the profit.

Chapter 9

A man who dies and leaves his wife as someone waiting for her levir, even if he leaves property of 100 maneh and her ketubah is only 1 maneh (sic! supplied from manuscripts), his inheritors are not able to sell [any of it] because all the property is [potentially] mortgaged for her ketubah. What should he [the levir] do? Marry her and divorce her, and she should write for him a receipt for her ketubah. If he left his brothers money, or the yevamah had money in a debt to her husband, he shouldn't say "Since I inherit, I will seize [them]"—rather, they take [them] away from him and buy with them land [i.e. property] and he eats the fruit [i.e. gets the profits from it].
A woman who wants to hide her property from her husband, she should write them in a contract of guardianship to another [so that her husband doesn't have access to them]—words of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. But the Hakhamim say: He is playing with her! [The buyer has full access to the property and there is nothing she can do about it]. Rather, she should write them in a gift [contract with the words:] "From today until the moment that I want [to take the property back]".
Rabbi Yehudah says: [The husband] can always eat the fruits' fruit [i.e. the interest's interest, even if he said in the ketubah that he gives up access to the fruit from her property]. How so? He can sell the fruit and buy with [that money] land, and he can eat the fruit. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and Rabbi Yohanan ben Berokah say: If she dies, he inherits it [the fruit, even if he said he wouldn't have access to it in the ketubah], for she made a stipulation against what was written in the Torah and anyone who stipulates against what is written in the Torah, his stipulation is null and void.
One who dies and leaves moveable property, and there is upon him [the responsibility for] his wife's ketubah and [for] a creditor—anyone who comes first [to claim their money] wins out [even to the extent that there is nothing left in his property such that] he is buried from charity funds.
These are those (sic!, the word "inheritors" is not in the Ehrfurt manuscript) who come with her permission [whom the inheritors can force to take an oath, even if they exempt her from doing so; see Mishnah Ketubot 8:5): Anyone to whom she sold [the property in question] or gave as a gift. If he wrote for her [in the ketubah]: "I will have no vow or oath upon you", the inheritors are not able to cause her to swear on things that were used after the death of her husband [that she didn't use them and therefore owes no money]. When does this apply? When she went from her husband's grave to her father's house. But, if she went from her husband's grave to her father-in-law's house, even if he wrote for her "I will have no vow or oath upon you", the inheritors are able to make her swear about property she used after her husband's death.
A man can't make his wife swear [that she didn't misuse his property] until he appoints her as a shopkeeper [in his shop] or until he makes her an administrator [over his property]. A wife, while she is claiming her ketubah, the inheritors [of her dead husband] can make her swear [that she did not already collect it]; if she is not claiming her ketubah, the inheritors cannot make her swear—words of Rabbi Shimon. But the Hakhamim say: Either way, the inheritors can make her swear.
[The owner can make his] tenant [swear an oath] whenever he is a tenant. If he leaves his tenancy, behold he is like any other man. A joint owner [can be made to swear by his partner] whenever he is a joint owner. If he leaves his partnership, behold he is like any other man. An administrator—whenever he is an administrator. If he leaves his administratorship, behold he is like any other man.
The member of the house that they spoke about (in Mishnah Shevuot 7:8, where they list the types of people, inclduding those in the previous halakhah here who can be made to swear an oath even if there is no certain claim of lost money) is not someone who comes and goes, but one who brings in fruit and takes out fruit, one who hires labourers and dismisses labourers. One who gets a loan from [his fellow] on the 6th or 7th year, and in the 8th year is made for him a business partner or a tenant, is exempt [from being made to swear an oath related to his loan, but still can be made to swear an oath on his partnership or tenancy, because the 7th year annulled the loan and anything related to it]. But, if he is made for him a partner or tenant on the 6th or 7th year, and in the 8th year returns and takes a loan from him, they roll over him everything [i.e. he can be made to swear both oaths].
One who reduces her ketubah, she can collect [it] without an oath [that she hasn't already collected it]. How so? Her ketubah was 1000 zuz. He said to her: "You received your ketubah", and she says, "I didn't receive it but it was only 100 zuz"—she can collect without an oath. [She can't collect her ketubah from] mortgaged property [without an oath]—one doesn't even need to say this for after her husband's death, but even during her husbands life. [She can't collect her ketubah from] property of orphans—one doesn't need to say this for adults, but even from minors.
He divorces her with a get but she has no ketubah—[if she was when married] a virgin, she collects 200 zuz; [if she was] a non-virgin, she collects 100. [If she has] a ketubah but she doesn't have a get—she can't collect anything, because if she says "I lost my get", he can say "I lost my receipt". Originally, they used to say (compare to Mishnah Ketubot 9:9): One who divorces her [with] her ketubah, she needs to go out with a get—words of Rabbi Meir. But Hakhamim say: From the [time of] danger onwards they decreed that it can be from a piece of it in court and she can collect with it.
Two ketubot, one get and one death, she can collect two ketubot. A get, a ketubah and a death—if the get is from before the ketubah, she can collect two ketubot; if the ketubah is from before the get, she can only collect one ketubah, for [it must be that] the one who divorced her took her back and took her back with the understanding that the first ketubah [remained in place]. (The following omitted in the printed edition, supplied from Ehrfurt manuscript:) If she wrote a receipt for him [for her whole ketubah] while they were married, he divorced her, took her back and died—she takes her ketubah of 100 zuz [the minimum for a non-virgin from the 2nd marriage]. If he made a new [ketubah], she takes whatever is in the new [ketubah].
(The following based on Ehrfurt manuscript, against the printed edition:) A minor boy whose father married him off, his ketubah stands [when he grows to majority age, he still has to pay the ketubah to his wife on the event of his death or divorce]. But if he wrote a new ketubah [when he was of majority age], she can take whatever is in the new [ketubah]. A convert that converts with his wife, his ketubah stands, for it was with this understanding that he upheld it. But if he wrote a new [ketubah], she can take whatever is in the new ketubah.

Chapter 10

A man who married two wives and died—the first one has precedence over the second one, and the inheritors [born to] the first one have precedence over the inheritors [born to] the second one. If he divorced the first one, remarried her and wrote for her a new ketubah—the first ketubah of the first one takes precedence over the second and her inheritors; the second one and her inheritors take precedence over the second ketubah of the first one. When does this apply? With the ketubah, but regarding financial support—both [wives] are equal. Wives and daughters are both equal [with regard to their financial support after the father's death].
He married the first one but she died, he married the second one and he died, if there is a dinar left over—these ones take the ketubah of their mother [because of ketubat banin dikhrin] and these ones take the ketubah of their mother. If there is no extra dinar—the second one and her inheritors take the ketubah of their mother and the rest is divided equally [among the sons like a normal inheritance].
If he wrote [in a contract] to financially support his wife's daughter [after his death], or his wife's son—behold, they are like creditors and take precedence over everyone else [like the people collecting the ketubah payments in the previous halakhah]. He shouldn't say to them: "Go and do work, and I will support you", but rather they [can merely] sit [idly] and are elligible for financial support. If he wrote to support his wife's daughter and she gave him a receipt [that she doesn't need this], he (sic!, should read "הימנה") does not have the power [to decide on behalf of her minor children that they shouldn't receive financial support], for they act for a minor's benefit but they do not act for a minor's disadvantage.
A wife who said, "My husband died" [and there is no independent verification]—she can either be supported [by her husband's estate] or take her ketubah. [If she said] "My husband divorced me"—she is supported up until [the value of] her ketubah [since she is certainly entitled to her ketubah, whether her husband died or divorced her]. What is the difference between death and divorce [such that she is automatically believed if she said her husband died but not if she said he divorced her]? With death, she is not able to contradict him; but with divorce, she is able to contradict him, for she could say to him: "You divorced me!"
Three people that threw [money] into a [combined] purse and some of it was stolen—they bring the rest into the middle and divide it equally. Two people that threw [money] into a purse, this one 100 zuz, that on 200 zuz, and they were occupied in business together—they split the profits equally. If this one bought with his own [money] and that one bought with his own but they got mixed up together—this one takes what is his and that one takes what is his. Three [loan] contracts [owned by one person] that were issued at the same time—the first [debtor] can make the second one swear [that he hasn't already collected his debt since he is concerned lest there not be enough property for him], and the second can make the third one swear. If the second wants to not make the first one swear, the third one can prevent him [since his oath also applies to the third one, who is even more worried that there will not be enough property]. One who has a loan from one person and sold his field to two people [and the field is worth the loan amount], then the creditor wrote to the second one "I have nothing on these things with you"—the second one (sic! should read, "he", i.e. the creditor; see Lieberman) is not able to collect because he relinquished the place that he could have collected from.
A convert who died and a [born] Jew plundered his property [since the convert had no heirs or parents to inherit], but he issued a wife's ketubah and has a creditor—they [the wife or the creditor] should collect from the last of [the property, whatever is left over from the Jew]. If there is none left—they should collect from what is in front of him [the Jew]. If there is none left—they should collect from what is in front of his face [the Jew].

Chapter 11

A widow who claims her ketubah, but the inheritors [of her husband] say to her: "You received your ketubah [already]!"—until she is [re]married, they need to bring evidence that she received her ketubah; once she is [re]married, she needs to bring evidence that she did not receive her ketubah. If she sold her ketubah, used her ketubah as a pledge [for a loan that goes to the creditor in the meantime], used her ketubah as a security [on a loan but that remains with her]—she loses her financial support. Rabbi Shimon says: Even if she sold some [of her ketubah], even if she made some of it as a pledge or some of it as a deposit—she loses her financial support. One doesn't need to say [that this applies] after her husband's death, but even during her husband's lifetime [if she did these things to her ketubah, she would lose her right to financial support after his death]. But [her losing her financial support only applies if] she writes [in the contract dealing with her ketubah] "These I sold for my ketubah, these I sold for my financial support"—words of Rabbi Yehudah. Rabbi Yoseh says: [It applies only] if she sold and wrote without specification; that's why her legal power is stronger [that most of the time the inheritors have to bring the evidence].
Just as a widow can sell [her ketubah] without the court, so too can her inheritors [or] those who come with her permission sell [it] without the court. Said Rabbi Shimon: Why did they say that a widow can sell [it] without the court? In order to benefit the orphans, such that they shouldn't plunder their property [if they have to wait to go to court, they will be using up their property in the meantime, so they said that they don't need a court and can sell the ketubah immediately]. If she took possession of a field that was made a security [for her ketubah] and ate it [i.e. used up the value of the property], but profits came out of it—they evaluate for her what she ate, and evaluate for her the profits [just like someone who took possession of a field without permission]. If they evaluate for her in a court, whatever they evaluated is evaluated.
Three people that came down to evaluate [the property of orphans in order to ascertain the financial support for the dead man's wife and children; see Rashbam on Bava Batra 107a:7:1]—one says "It's worth 100 zuz" and two say "200"; [or] one says "200" and two say "100", the lone voice is annulled in its minority [so in both cases the majority stands]. One says "It's worth 100 zuz", one says "80 zuz (= 20 selaim)", one says "120 zuz (= 30 selaim)"—it is evaluated at 100 zuz (the average of all 3). Rabbi Lazar bar Rabbi Tzadok says: They evaluate it at 90 zuz (= dinar) [we ignore the highest value and average the two lowest value, 80 and 100]. Others say: They do an evaluation between them (take the range, = 40 zuzim) and evaluate them as a third [so they take the lowest value, 80 zuz, and add the third of the range = 93 1/3 zuz].
Which is [the time limit for] an announcement of investigation [inviting buyers to view and evaluate a certain property]? An evaluation of orphan's property—30 days; an evaluation of [property that was declared] hekdesh—60 days. If [after the evaluation] they sold [something] worth 100 zuz for 200, or something worth 200 for 100—the sale stands [could be that they made a mistake, or else that they couldn't find buyers for the agreed price]. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Judges' evaluations that were mistakenly too low or mistakenly too high—their sale stands.
She [a widow] that sold something worth 101 zuz for 100, even if she says "I will return the [extra] zuz to the inheritors"—her sale is null and void. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Her sale certainly stands, and she should return the zuz to the inheritors; and [her sale is void] only if there was some left over [from the sale that she did not give to the inheritors]. Therefore, if she reduced or added [to the price of the property she is selling], she only has the price that she sold it [and has to return the excess to the inheritors]. (Based on Ehrfurt manuscript:) Rabbi Liezer: An orphan girl has [the right to] worn out clothes [like a widow]. Rabbi Yehudah said in the name of Rabbi Liezer: An orphan girl has [the right to] fruit [i.e. interest from her property].
A son whose father died and his mother says "Let him grow up with me", but [his father's] inheritors say "Let him grow up with us"—they do not leave him to grow up with those who are able to inherit from him [i.e. his brothers]. This once happened and they slaughtered him on the day before Pesah.
A wife whose husband died—she can dwell in the houses like she would dwell in them while her husband was alive, she can use the slaves and handmaids, silver and gold vessels, just as she would use them while her husband was alive, for thus he writes for her [in the ketubah]: "You should dwell in my house and be supported from my property any number of days you are a widow in my house."
A man who says [as provisions for after his death]: "Pay for a widow's house for my daughter"; [or] "A house for Ploni to dwell in", and it [the house] fell—the inheritors are obligated to rebuild it. If he said, "This house should be widow's house for my daughter"; [or] "This house should be for Ploni to dwell in"—the inheritors are not obligated to rebuild it. A man who says: "Pay for a widow's house for my daughter"—they don't pay for her unless she agrees to dwell in it, and the inheritors are able to prevent her from renting it to another; therefore, if she dies, they inherit her.
One who makes a loan to his fellow on the basis of a pledge, but the pledge was lost/destroyed—he can collect [the loan] from the remaining property. If he said to him: "[I gave you this pledge] with the understanding that you would only be able to collect from this [pledge]"—he cannot collect from the remaining property. One who makes his field a security for the ketubah of his wife and a river drowns it—she can collect from the remaining property. If he said to her "With the understanding that you can only collect from this [field]"—she cannot collect from the remaining property.

Chapter 12

Originally, when her ketubah was with her father, it was light in [her husband's] eyes to divorce her. Shimon ben Shatah decreed that her ketubah should be with her husband and that he should write for her "All of my property will be mortgaged or pledged for your ketubah". They do not make a wife's ketubah from moveable items [i.e. they don't make moveable items the thing that she can collect from it, but rather real estate] because of tikkun ha-olam. Said Rabbi Yose: What tikkun ha-olam is there in this!? It is because they [the moveable items] have no fixed value.
Why did they say that damages are evaluated from the best property? Because of robbers and violent men, such that each should say, "Why would I steal? Why would I be violent? For tomorrow the court will evaluate my best field!" They relied on the verse "The best of his field, the best of his vineyard he should pay" (Shemot 22:4).
Why did they say that a creditor [collects from] average property? Because of the deceivers, such that each wouldn't set their eye upon their fellow's best field or their best courtyard, make a loan to him, and jump and take it [as the payment for the loan]. If so, they should evaluate it from the worst property! [They don't do that] in order to not erect fences before debtors, for tomorrow they would need to loan and no one would give them one. (Translated from Ehrfurt manuscript).
A wife's ketubah [is collected by her] from the worst property—words of Rabbi Yehudah. Rabbi Shimon says: Why did they say that a wife's ketubah [is collected] from the worst property? [Because] more than a man wants to marry, a woman wants to be married. Furthermore, a woman's shame is greater than that of a man. If so, she shouldn't have a ketubah at all! Rather, [it is because] a wife is divorced willingly or unwillingly, but a man only divorces willingly.
If there is only the best property—they all (all of the categories of collection in the previous halakhot) collect from the best property. [If there is only the] average property—they all collect from the average property. [If there is only the] worst property—they all collect from the worst property. [If there is just] best and average property—damages are evaluated from the best; loans and a wife's ketubah from the average. [If there is just] average and worst property—damages and loans [are evaluated] from the average; a wive's ketubah from the worst. If he sold them [all 3 kinds of property] to one person, or to three people at the same time—they come under the [control of the] new owners, [which means that] damages [that have to be collected him, even from his buyer] are evaluated from the best property [that he sold him], debts from the average, and a wife's ketubah from the worst. If he sold them to three people at different times—even damages [can be evaluated] from the worst property and a wife's ketubah from the best property, [because] they collect from the last [of them, whichever one has the most recent claim]. If [that buyer] does not have [enough to pay the debt], they collect from the one before him; if [that second buyer] does not have [enough either], they collect from the one before the one that was before him.
Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: One who makes his field a security for his bride's ketubah, she has the upper hand—if she wants she can collect from it, or if she wants she can collect from the remaining property.
A widow that said "I don't want to move out of my husband's house", the inheritors are not able to prevent her, for this is the honour of her husband. If she said "I do not want to move out of my father's house", the inheritors are able to prevent her, for she increases blessings for the house.
(Translated according to Ehrfurt manuscript:) For as long as she is in her father's house, she can collect her ketubah forever. For as long as she is in her husband's house, she can collect her ketubah up to 25 years, for [her living costs in] 25 years is about the amount of her ketubah—words of Rabbi Meir in the name of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. Rabbi Yishmael says: 30 years. But Hakhamim say: For as long as she is in her husband's house, she can collect her ketubah forever; for as long as she is in her father's house, she can mention her ketubah for 25 years. Just as she can mention her ketubah for 25 years, so too her inheritors and those who come with her permission can mention her ketubah for 25 years. Creditors can collect for ever, even if they did not mention it.
(Translated from Ehrfurt manuscript:) A man who went to the land beyond the sea and his wife came to claim her financial support, if he said [before he left]: "Spend her handiwork on her support"—he is permitted to do so. If the court set up her support, whatever they agreed is agreed.
Said Rabbi Yose son of Rabbi Yehudah: Admon and Hakhamim did not disagree (in Mishnah Ketubot about one whose father agreed [to add money in the dowry] for her that she is able to say: "My father agreed [this money] for me. What am I able to do? Either marry me or divorce me!" Regarding what [case] did they disagree? When she agreed to pay it herself. Admon says: She is able to say: "I thought my father would pay me, but now that my father is not paying me, what am I able to do? Either marry me or divorce me!" Said Rabban Gamliel: I agree with the words of Admon. One who agreed money for his minor daughter [in her dowry] and then tried to weasel out of it, they force him to pay, for one can act [in a minor's] favour but not to their detriment.
There are 3 countries for marriage: Judah, Transjordan and Galilee. When does this apply? When he is from Judah and betrothed a wife from Judah, [or if he is] from Galilee and betroths a wife from Galilee; but if he is from Judah and betroths a wife from Galilee; [or] from Galilee and he betroths a woman from Judah—they force them to leave, for it was with this understanding [to stay in the place that they were married] that she was married. If he said: "I am Ploni from Judah and I married a wife from Galilee"—they do not force them to leave. But in the Galilee, they do force him to leave.
They [a married partner] can take them [their partner] out of a town that is mostly Gentiles to a town that is mostly Jews, but they cannot take them from a town that is mostly Jews to a town that is mostly Gentiles. If he wants to come to Eretz Yisrael but she does not want to come, they force her to come. If she wants but he doesn't want, they force him to come. If he wants to leave Eretz Yisrael but she doesn't want, they do not force her to leave. If she wants but he doesn't want, they force her to not leave.
One who produces a contract written in Bavel, he collects based on it Babylonian money. [If it were written in] Eretz Yisrael, he collects on it Eretz Yisraeli money. If it were written without specification and he produced it in Bavel, he collects on it Babylonian money; [but if he produced it] in Eretz Yisrael, he collects upon it Eretz Yisraeli money. If it were written in it "money" without specification—then he can collect in any location['s currency] he wants, which is not true for a wife's ketubah [which must be Eretz Yisraeli money]. (Translated from Ehrfurt manuscript).
If he married a wife in Eretz Yisrael and divorced her in Eretz Yisrael, he pays her Eretz Yisraeli money. [If he married her] in Eretz Yisrael but divorced her in Bavel, he pays her Eretz Yisraeli money. [If he married her] in Bavel but divorced her in Eretz Yisrael, he pays her Eretz Yisraeli money. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: A wife's ketubah and a loan document in the [currency of the] place of the marriage [or document]. The 5 selaim for [the redemption of a firstborn] son, the 30 shekalim [as damages when your ox gores someone else's slave], the 50 shekalim [fine] of the rapist or seducer, and the 100 zuz [fine] of the one who falsely accused his wife of not being a virgin]—all of them, even though they are in Bavel, he collects upon them Eretz Yisraeli money. Money that the Torah speaks about in any place is Tyrian money; Tyrian money is Yerushalmi money.
