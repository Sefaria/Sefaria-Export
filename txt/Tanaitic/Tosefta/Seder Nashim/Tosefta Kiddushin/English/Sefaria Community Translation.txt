Tosefta Kiddushin



Chapter 1

A wife is acquired in 3 ways and can acquire herself in 2 ways. She can be acquired with money, contract or sex. How so with money? He gave her money or something worth money, he said to her: "Behold you are betrothed to me", "Behold you are engaged to me", "Behold you are my wife", "Behold this one is betrothed". But if she gave him money or something worth money and said to him "Behold I am engaged to you", "Behold I am betrothed to you", "Behold I am your wife"—she is not betrothed. Contract? One needs to say that the contract has to be worth a perutah—even if he wrote it on clay or bad paper, she is betrothed. With sex? All sex that is for the sake of betrothal—she is betrothed; if it is not for the sake of betrothal—she is not betrothed.
A man shouldn't marry a wife until his niece is grown up or until he finds someone appropriate for him, as it is said, "The land was full of lust" (Vayikra 19:29). "It is lust" (Vayikra 20:14). Rabbi Eliezer says: This is a single man who has sex with a single woman not for the sake of marriage. Rabbi Eliezer said: From where do we know that he [the single man from the previous statement] is punished before God like the one who has sex with a woman and her mother? It is said here "Lust" and it is said there "A man who marries a woman and her mother—it is lust" (Vayikra 20:14). Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya'akov says: Because he has sex with many women and it is not known with which he has had sex; and she receives it from many men and it is not known from which of them she received it—it turns out that this man marries his daughter, this one marries his sister, and all of the world will be bastards. That's why it is said, "The earth will be full of lust" (zimah)—this one, what is he (zeh mah hu)? He is not a kohen, levi or Yisrael (sic! placement of this line based on Ehrfurt manuscript and the derash of זימה = זה מה). Rabbi Yehudah (sic! based on Ehrfurt manuscript) says: Behold it says "Do not prostitute the land" (Vayikra 19:29)—the produce degenerates. The Hakhamim decided by majority to support Rabbi Yehudah (sic!): "Lift your eyes to the lowlands and see where you have not been ravished... and the rains have been withheld" (Yirmiyahu 3:2-3) [i.e. your sexual immorality directly causes the rains to stop and the produce to degenerate].
Which is "deduction of price" [through which a Hebrew slave can go free according to Mishnah Kiddushin 1:2]? He wanted to redeem himself within those [6] years [that he is a slave], he calculated the coins and the years [remaining] and payed them to his master, and the slave has the upper hand [he can calculate based on how much his price was worth when he sold himself originally or how much that would be worth now, whichever is better for him]. Which is presumption [of ownership] of land? A lock, fence or opening of any size [that belongs to him]—this is a presumption [of ownership]. Which is presumption [of ownership] of [Canaanite] slaves? If [the slave] ties [the owner's] shoe, undoes his shoe, brings vessels after him to the bathhouse—this is a presumption. If he lifted him up [e.g. to help him get on a horse]—Rabbi Shimon said: There is no greater presumption than this.
[The Hebrew slave] acquires himself with [loss of] major limbs (see Shemot 21:26). He acquires himself with money via others and a contract via himself, [and he can't acquire with his own money] because he is like one who gives from the left hand to his right [i.e. whatever is his is his master's, so the money needs to come from elsewhere]—words of Rabbi Meir. But Hakhamim say: [Even] money via himself or a contract via others, as long as the money belongs to others and he says to him [when he gives him the money], "[This is] with the understanding that you can only redeem [yourself] with this money". Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Meir: Even a contract via others, but not one via himself.
A ship is acquired with drawing (meshikhah). Rabbi Natan says: A ship and documents are acquired with drawing and with a contract. Which is drawing? Whether he drew [the animal], whether he drove [it], whether he called to it and it came after him—this is drawing. Which is handing over (mesirah)? Anyone who handed over to him the halter and he took it—this is handing over. In what cases did they say that moveable property is acquired with drawing? In the public road or in a courtyard which doesn't belong to either [party in the transaction]. On the property of the buyer, whenever he accepts it, he acquires.  On the property of the seller, when he lifts it or until he takes it out of the owner's property. On the property of the one with whom he deposited [the animal], until he [the bailee] accepts it [the responsibility of looking after the item for the buyer] or until he [the buyer] rents the place [where the item is stored with the bailee].
One can exchange land for land, moveables for moveables, land for moveables, moveables for land—when this one takes ownership, the other one becomes liable for its exchange (see Mishnah Kiddushin 1:6).
[The process of something being transferred to the] ownership of the Temple with money, how so? If the treasurer gave coins for hekdesh moveable property, he acquires the hekdesh wherever he is; but a layperson [not empowered by the authority of the Temple] doesn't acquire until the moment he draws [it]. Speech [by a Temple treasurer or another official is as effective in transferring property] to the Temple as the handing over of a layperson. How so? "This ox is hekdesh", "This house is hekdesh"—even from where to the end of the world, he acquires the hekdesh wherever he is; but a layperson only acquires when he takes possession [of it].
Which is a positive time-caused mitzvah [for which women/wives are exempt]? Sukkah, lulav and tefilin. Which is a positive non-time-caused mitzvah? [Returning a] lost object, sending away the mother bird [in order to take the eggs], [setting up] a railing [on your roof] and tzitzit. Rabbi Shimon exempts wives from tzitzit because it is a positive time-caused mitzvah. Which is a mitzvah of the son about [his] father? Feeding, giving drink, clothing, anointing, taking out and bringing in, washing his face, hands and legs. [This applies to anyone] whether a man or wife, except that a man has the opportunity to do it, but a wife does not have the opportunity to do it because others [her husband] have authority over her. What is a mitzvah of the father about [his] son? To circumcise him, redeem him [with 5 selaim if he is a firstborn], to teach him Torah, to teah him a trade and to marry him to a wife. Some say: Also to swim in the river. Rabbi Yehudah says: Anyone who doesn't teach his son a trade teaches him banditry.
(Translated from Ehrfurt manuscript:) Rabban Gamliel says: Anyone who has a trade, to what is he similar? To a vineyard that is surrounded by its fence, to a furrow that is surrounded by a hedge. Rabbi Yoseh says in the name of Rabban Gamliel: Anyone who has a trade, to what is he similar? To a woman that has a husband—whether she is adorned or not, everybody doesn't gaze at her, but if she is not adorned then she will have a curse [since she isn't trying to dress up for her husband]. Anyone who does not have a trade, to what is he similar? To a woman without a husband—whether she is adorned or not, everyone gazes at her, but if she is adorned she will have a curse [since she is dressing up for random men]. Rabbi Yoseh bar Rabbi Lazar said in the name of Rabban Gamliel: Anyone who has a trade, to what is he similar? To a fenced vineyard where cattle and wild animals can't enter into it, passersby can't enter into it and can't see what is in it. Anyone without a trade, to what is he similar? To an open vineyard, for cattle and wild animals enter into it, passersby enter into it and can see what is in it.
Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon says: Any mitzvah that Yisrael was obligated in before they came to the Land is practised in the Land and ouside the Land; [any mitzvah] that [Yisrael] was not obligated in before they came to the Land is only practised in the Land, except for remission of loans, redemption of sales and sending away the Hebrew slave, for even though they were not obligated in them until they came to the Land, they are practised in the Land and outside the Land.
One who does 1 mitzvah, it causes good for him, it lengthens his days and his years and he inherits the soil. Anyone who does one averah, it causes bad for him, it plucks off his days and he does not inherit the land. About this one it is said, "One sinner can destroy much good" (Kohelet 9:18)—with a single sin, this one destroyed for him many good things. A person should always see himself as if he is half innocent and half guilty. If he does one mitzvah, he is happy that he tipped his scale to the side of innocence. If he does one averah, woe to him! he tipped his scale to the side of guilt. About this one it is said, "One sinner can destroy much good"—with a single sin, this one destroyed for him many good things. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of Rabbi Meir: Because an individual is judged according to the majority [of his deeds] and the world is judged according to the majority [of the deeds performed in it], one who does one mitzvah is happy that he has tipped his scales and the scales of the world to the side of innocence; if he does one averah, woe to him! he tips his scale and the scale of the world to the side of guilt. About this one it is said, "One sinner can destroy much good"—with a single sin, this one destroyed for him many good things. Rabbi Shimon says: If someone was righteous their entire life, but in the end rebelled, he lost everything, as it is said, "The righteousness of the righteous will not save him on the day of his wickedness" (Yehezkel 33:12). If someone were wicked all their life and did teshuvah at the end, God receives him, as it is said, "He will not trip on the wickedness of the wicked on the day he returns from his wickedness" (Yehezkel 33:12). Anyone who is engaged in all three of them—in Scripture, Mishnah and an occupation—about this person it is said, "The threefold cord will not be quickly broken" (Kohelet 4:12).

Chapter 2

Just as a man can't betroth his son with himself or his agent, so too a woman can't betroth her daughter with herself or her agent.
A man who says to a woman: "Behold you are betrothed to me with the understanding that I am Yosef", but it turns out he is Yosef and [also] Shimon; "With the understanding that I am a spice merchant", but it turns out he is a spice merchant and [also] a tanner; "With the understanding that I am a townsman", but it turns out that he is a townsman and [also] a city dweller—she is betrothed. "That I am no one other than Yosef", but it turns out he is Yosef and Shimon; "That I am nothing other than a spice merchant", but it turns out he is a spice merchant and a tanner; "That I am nothing other than a townsman", but it turns out that he is a townsman and a city dweller—she is not betrothed.
"Be betrothed to me with this one and with this one [a food item, one-by-one; see Mishnah Kiddushin 2:1]" and she ate the first one, if there remains in her hand something worth a perutah—she is betrothed; but if not, she is not betrothed. "Be betrothed to me with this cup", if there is [enough] in it [the cup] and what is inside it [the contents] worth a perutah—she is betrothed; but if not, she is not betrothed; she takes ownership over it and everything inside it. "With what is in this cup", if there is [enough of] what is inside it worth a perutah—she is betrothed; but if not, she is not betrothed; she takes ownership over only what is inside of it [and not the cup itself].
"With the understanding that I am poor", and he was poor but became rich; "With the understanding that I am rich", and he was rich but became poor; "With the understanding that I am a spice merchant", and he was a spice merchant but became a tanner; "With the understanding that I am a tanner", and he was a tanner but came a spice merchant; "With the understanding that I am a townsman", and he was a townsman but became a city dweller; "With the understanding that I am a city dweller", and he was a city dweller but he became a townsman; "With the understanding that I have children", and he had children but they subsequently died; "With the understanding that I have no children", and he did not have children but they were subsquently born to him—she is betrothed.
"That I am nothing other than poor", and he was rich but became poor; "That I am nothing other than rich", and he was poor but became rich; "That I am nothing other than a spice merchant", and he was a tanner but became a spice merchant; "That I am nothing other than a tanner", and he was a spice merchant but became a tanner; "That I am nothing other than a townsman", and he was a city dweller but became a townsman; "That I am nothing other than a city dweller", and he was a townsman but became a city dweller; "That I have no children", and he had [children] but they subsequently died; "That I have children", and he did not have them but they were subsequently born to him—she is not betrothed. This is the pneumonic: Any stipulation that is fulfilled at the moment of betrothal—even if it became void afterwards—she is betrothed; and any [stipulation] that is not fulfilled at the moment of betrothal—even if it was fulfilled afterwards—she is not betrothed.
"Be betrothed to me with this sela", and after she took it from his hand, she said, "I thought you were kohen but you're only a levi"; "that you were rich but you're actually poor"—she is betrothed. This is the pneumonic: Anytime the betrothal [money] falls into her hand, whether he deceived her or she deceived him—she is betrothed. Rabbi Shimon says: If deceived her for increased money, then she is betrothed. How so? "With this silver dinar" but it turns out to be [made] of gold, she would rather have the gold one than the silver one; "[That I am] poor" but it turns out he is rich, she would rather [be betrothed to] a rich man than a poor man. Rabbi Shimon concedes that if he deceived her for increased pedigree [e.g. he claimed to be a kohen when he was only a levi]—she is not betrothed.
"Be betrothed to me with this sela"; "with this cow"; "with this robe", when she takes the sela, draws the cow or holds the robe—she is betrothed.
"Take this sela for me", and at the moment of gift, he said, "Behold you are betrothed to me"—she is betrothed. [If he said this] after she took it from his hand—if she wants, she is betrothed, and if she wants she is not betrothed. "[Take] this sela that I am obligated to you for [from some prior agreement]", and at the moment of gift, he said, "Behold you are betrothed to me"—if she wants, she is betrothed, and if she wants she is not betrothed. [If he said this] after she took it from his hand—even if they both want [her to be betrothed], she is not betrothed.
"Be betrothed to me with my sela that is in your hand" (that is owed to him but currently in her possession, from some prior loan or agreement)—she is not betrothed. What should he do? He should take it from her, return and give it to her, and say to her, "Behold you are betrothed to me". "Be betrothed to me with this sela", and after she took it out of his hand she threw it into the sea or the river—she is not betrothed. "Be betrothed to me with a maneh", and she said to him, "Give it to Ploni"—she is not betrothed. (Extra line from manuscripts:)  "That he should receive it for me"—she is betrothed. (Following translated from Ehrfurt manuscript:) If he gave her [the money of] her betrothal but didn't say to her, "Behold you are betrothed to me"—Rabbi Yehudah says: She is not betrothed; Rabbi Yoseh says: She is betrothed; Rabbi says: If they are occupied with that topic [of conversation, i.e. betrothal or marriage, when he gave her the money], she is betrothed; but if not, she is not betrothed.
"Be betrothed to me with this maneh (= 100 dinar)", but it turns out that it the maneh is lacking a dinar—she is not betrothed. If there is in it a bad[ly crafted] dinar—he should exchange [it for a good dinar]. If he were counting [the maneh] and threw [it] into her hand one at a time, she is able to renege until the moment he finishes [counting].
This one says "With a maneh (= 100 zuz)", but the other says "With 200 zuz" (i.e. either the man or the woman, they disagree on the right number), and each one goes to their house, and afterwards one takes the other to court and betroths them—if the man takes the woman to court, they should do whatever the woman said; but if the woman takes the man to court, they should do whatever the man said. And this is also true for someone who sells an object and [the buyer] was counting [the money to put it] into [seller's] hand—[the seller] is able to renege until [the buyer] finishes [counting]. If this one says "With a maneh", but the other says "With 200 zuz", and they each go home, and afterwards they take each other to court—if the buyer took the seller to court, they should do whatever the seller said; but if the seller took the buyer to court, they should do whatever the buyer said.

Chapter 3

A man who says to a woman, "Behold you are betrothed to me with this deposited item that I own but that is in your control" [i.e. he deposited an item with her previously and wants to betroth by giving her the item to keep], if she went and found that it was stolen or lost/destroyed, if there is still left in her control something worth a perutah [i.e. that there is enough value left in whatever of the item remains after being stolen or damaged]—she is betrothed; but if not—she is not betrothed. (The following translated from Ehrfurt manuscript:) But with a loan [i.e. if he had a loan with her and he offered to forgive the loan as her betrothal money], even if there was not left in her control something worth a perutah [even if she hased used the money from the loan]—she is betrothed. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Meir: A loan is like a deposit: if there is left in her control something worth a perutah—she is betrothed; but if not—she is not betrothed.
A man who said to a woman: "Behold you are betrothed to me with the understanding that I will talk to the ruler about you"; "[With the understanding that] I will work as a labourer with you", and he gave her something worth a perutah—she is betrothed immediately [even if he hasn't fulfilled his condition yet], until he says "I didn't speak [to the ruler]" or "I didn't work [as a labourer]" [when she becomes retroactively never betrothed]—words of Rabbi Meir. But Hakhamim say: If the stipulation is fulfilled—she is betrothed; but if not—she is not betrothed. (But see Lieberman who thinks this is about tenai kaful.) Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: There is no [valid] stipulation in the ketubah that isn't doubled (tenai kaful, that explains what would happen both if he did the thing he promised and also if he didn't do it).
"[Be betrothed to me] with the understanding that I will speak about you to the ruler" [and he also gave her something worth a perutah], if he spoke about her in the way of casual conversation—she is betrothed [meaning: this is the minimum amount of speech that would fulfil the stipulation, but note "כדרך מדברים" doesn't appear in the Ehrfurt manuscript]; but if not—she is not betrothed. [If he said,] "[Be betrothed to me] for the price of me speaking about you to the ruler", if he spoke about her about something worth a perutah—she is betrothed; but if not—she is not betrothed.
(Translated from the Ehrfurt manuscript:) [If he said,] "[Be betrothed to me] for the price the daily work (melakhah) that I will do with you", if he did [work for her] that was worth a perutah—she is betrothed; but if not—she is not betrothed. "[Be betrothed to me] for the price of the [physical] labour that I will do with you", if he did [labour] with her worth a perutah—she is betrothed; but if not—she is not betrothed. "With the understanding that I will do [physical] labour with you", or "With the understanding that I will do labour with you tomorrow" [and he also gave her something worth a perutah], if he acted with her in the manner of labourers—she is betrothed; but if not—she is not betrothed.
"[Be betrothed to me] with the understanding that I have 200 zuz"—she is betrothed, [for] perhaps he will have it at the end of the world. "With the understanding that I have 200 zuz in a certain place", if he has that much in that place—she is betrothed; but if not—she is not betrothed. "With the understanding that I have it [but it is] with Ploni", even though he [Ploni] said "He has nothing in my domain"—she is betrothed, lest they make a conspiratorial partnership [to defraud her of her get]. Until he says "He has something in my domain"—she is betrothed; but if not—she is not betrothed.
"[Be betrothed to me] with the understanding that I will show you 200 zuz", if he showed [200 zuz randomly lying] on the table—she is not betrothed, for [we assume the understanding of those words is that he would] only show her [money] that belonged to him. "With the understanding that I have a beit kor of earth"—she is betrothed, for perhaps he will have it at the end of the world. "With the understanding that I have [a beit kor] in a certain place", if he has it in that place—she is betrothed; but if not—she is not betrothed. "With the understanding that I will show you a beit kor of earth", if he showed [it] to her in the valley [where no one owns the land]—she is not betrothed, for he only said to show to her what was his.
"[Be betrothed to me] with the understanding that Ploni is happy with it", even if [Ploni] said "I'm not happy with it"—she is betrothed, lest they form a conspiracy (sic! based on Ehrfurt manuscript). Until he said "I want it", if he says "I want it"—she is betrothed; but if not—she is not betrothed. "With the understanding that my father is happy with it", even if his father does not want it—she is betrothed, for perhaps he will be happy another time. If the father dies—she is betrothed. If the son dies—this actually happened and they came and taught the father to say "I do not want this".
(Translated from the Ehrfurt manuscript:) Any stipulation which has the action at the beginning, such a stipulation is invalid. How so? [If he, the brother-in-law whose brother died, said to her, his dead brother's wife,] "Now that I have released you from the levirate bond, with the understanding that my father is happy about it", even if his father doesn't want this—she is divorced [since he already released her with halitzah]. "Now that I have had sex with you, [be betrothed to me] with the understanding that my father is happy about it", even if his father doesn't want this—she is betrothed [since they already had sex, the stipulation is void]. Rabbi Shimon ben Yehudah says in the name of Rabbi Shimon: If the father wants it—she is betrothed, for she only had sex because of that original condition. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar had a pneumonic: Any stipulation which is possible to do oneself or with an agent and he stipulated about it—his stipulation stands; but any stipulation that is impossible to do except with his body and he stipulated about it—his stipulation is void. How so? "Behold I divorce you with the understanding that my father is happy about it", if the father wants it—she is divorced; but if he doesn't want it—she is not divorced. "Behold I betroth you with the understanding that my father is happy about it", if the father wants it—she is betrothed; but if he doesn't want it—she is not betrothed.
"[Be betrothed to me] with the understanding that if I die you will not bound to a levir"—she is betrothed but his stipulation is invalid, for he stipulated against what was written in the Torah, and anyone who stipulates against what is written in the Torah, his stipulation is invalid. "With the understanding that I will have no responsibility for you for clothing or sex"—she is betrothed but his stipulation is invalid. This is the pneumonic: Anyone who stipulates against what is written in the Torah regarding a monetary matter—his stipulation stands; with a non-monetary matter—his stipulation is invalid.
"[Be betrothed to me] with the understanding that I am rich"—he did not say "the richest of the rich", rather all of the people of his town pay him respect according to his wealth. (Translated according to Ehrfurt manuscript). "With the understanding that I am a sage"—he did not say like either Shimon ben Azzai or Shimon ben Zoma, but all the people of his town pay him respect. "With this silver dinar", but it turned out to be of gold—she is not betrothed. What should he do? Take it from her, return and give it to her, and say to her: "Behold you are betrothed to me."

Chapter 4

A man who gave permission to 3 people to betroth for him a wife—Rabbi Natan says: Beit Shammai say: Two of them can be witnesses and one of them an agent; but Beit Hillel say: All of them are agents and they are not able to testify.
(The following translated from Ehrfurt manuscript, which = Mishnah Kiddushin 2:4:) A man who says to his agent: "Go and betroth for me Plonit in a certain place", if he went and betrothed her in a different place—she is not betrothed. "[Go and betroth for me Plonit in] who is currently in a certain place", if he went and betrothed her in a different place—she is betrothed. Rabbi Elazar says: In both of these [cases] she is betrothed until he says [specifically] "I only want her to be betrothed to me in a certain place".
A man who says to his fellow: "Go and betroth for me Plonit", if he went and betrothed her for himself—she is betrothed to the second man. (Translated from Ehrfurt manuscript:) "[Go and betroth for me Plonit] from now until 30 days", if another came and betrothed her within (sic!) 30 days—she is betrothed to both of them (sic!). What should they do? One of them gives a get, one of them marries [her]. If they are two brothers, she is forbidden to both of them.
A man who betroths [a woman] in error, or with something worth less than a perutah—and so too a male minor that betroths—even if he sent betrothal gifts afterwards—she is not betrothed, for he sent [the gifts] on account of the first [invalid] betrothal. But if he had sex [with her]—he acquires [her through sex, see Tosefta Kiddushin 1:1]. Rabbi Shimon ben Yehudah says in the name of Rabbi Shimon: Even if he had sex [with her] he does not acquire, for the se was only on account of the original [invalid] betrothal.
A man who betroths [a woman] with stolen [money] or a deposit, or betrothed her with a sela that he seized from her—she is betrothed. If he said to her: "Be betrothed to me with the sela that you have [the stolen one I just returned to you"—she is not betrothed. What should he do? He should take it from her, return and give it to her, and say to her "Behold you are betrothed to me."
A man who betroths [a woman] with meat [from an animal designated for] tithe, even if after slaughter—she is not betrothed [since the met belongs to the Temple, it is not his to give her]. With its bones, its tendons, its horns, its hooves, its blood, its fat, its skin, its wool—she is betrothed [though the meat belongs to the Temple, the rest of the animal does not]. A [kohen] who betroths [a woman] with his priestly portion (see Ehrfurt manuscript and Mishnah Kiddushin 2:8)—whether it is of most holy sacrifices or less holy sacrifices—she is not betrothed. With hekdesh, if he [did this] intentionally [i.e. he knew it was hekdesh]—he betroths because he misappropriated [Temple property such that it now belongs to him but not the Temple]; if unintentionally—he did not misappropriate [and thus she is not betrothed since the item belonged to the Temple and not to him]—words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehudah says: If there is something worth a perutah in the profits [from the hekdesh item when he exchanged it with a priest, he owns these profits which is not true for the hekdesh item itself]—she is betrothed; but if not—she is not betrothed. Said Rabbi: I agree with the words of Rabbi Yehudah with hekdesh, but the words of Rabbi Meir with second tithe (see Mishnah Kiddushin 2:8).
A man who betroths a woman with idolatrous wine, with an idol, with [something belonging to] an idolatrous city [that was destroyed and everything in it turned to herem] or one of its inhabitants, with idolatrous skins, with an ashera [tree] or with its fruit, with the base [of an idolatrous altar] or what is upon it, with a markulis [stone altar to Mercury outside of houses or on roads] or what is upon it, or with anything upon which falls [the law of] forbidden [benefit from] idols—all of them, even if he sould them and betrothed [a wife] with their value—she is not betrothed. With the purifying waters or with purifying dust [from the red heifer ritual]—she is betrothed. (Rabbi Yehudah says:) If there is in the profits something worth a perutah [if you can generate incidental value from them, e.g. getting paid to move them from one place to another]—she is betrothed; but if not—she is not betrothed.
A man who says to a women, "Behold you are betrothed to me after I convert"; [or] "... after you convert"; "after I am freed"; "after you are freed"; "after your husband dies"; "after your levir will release you via halitzah"—with all of these, even though the stipulation was fulfilled—she is not betrothed.
[A man who says] "I arranged the betrothal of my daughter but I do not know to whom I betrothed her", and one man comes and says, "I betrothed her!"—he is believed to marry her. After [that happened and] she was married, another came and said, "I betrothed her!"—he does not have the power to forbid her [to her current husband, even if he were telling the truth]. (Translated from the Ehrfurt manuscript:) [A man who says] "I arranged the betrothal of my daughter"—[we assume that this] includes minor daughters but doesn't include major daughters. "My daughter was betrothed"—doesn't include minor daughters. "I [arranged the] divorce of my daughter"—includes minor daughters, but doesn't include major daughters. "My daughter was divorced"—includes neither major nor minor daughters. [If a man said about his daughter:] "She was captured and I redeemed her", or "She had sex with someone who would disqualify her"—he does not have the power to make her forbidden [to subsequently marry a priest]. "I arranged the betrothal of my daughter" and he has 10 daughters—they are all forbidden [to marry other men until the kiddushin is broken] because of doubt. If he said "major daughter"—only the eldest daughter is betrothed. If he said "minor"—only the youngest daughter is betrothed.
(Translated from Ehrfurt manuscript:) Two brothers that betrothed two sisters, but neither brother knows which one he betrothed—both [sisters] are forbidden [from having sex with either brother] because of the doubt [lest it turn out you're having sex with your brother's wife, which is a capital offence]. If they were planning on the eldest sister for the eldest brother and the youngest sister for the youngest brother, she says "I am the elder sister"—she is betrothed to the elder brother, and the younger sister is betrothed to the younger brother.
(Translating from Ehrfurt manuscript:) [If a man said to a woman:] "I betrothed you", but she says, "Only my daughter is betrothed"—the mother's relatives [that would be forbidden to him in the Torah if they were married] are forbidden [to him], but the mother is permitted to his relatives, he is permitted to the relatives of the daughter and the daughter is permitted to his relatives. "I betrothed your daughter", but she said, "You only betrothed me"—he is forbidden to the daughter's relatives, but the daughter is permitted to his relatives, he is permitted to the relatives of the mother and the mother is forbidden to his relatives.
The daughter of a priest, levi or Israelite that got married to a convert—the child lis a convert; to a freedman—the child is a freedman. A Gentile or slave that had sex with a daughter of Israel and she bore a son—the child is a bastard (mamzer). Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar (sic! based on Ehrfurt manuscript): There is no bastard except for from a woman that is forbidden by a forbidden sexual relationship and for which they make him suffer karet.

Chapter 5

Converts, freedmen, mamzerim (bastards), netinim (descendants of temple slaves), shetukim (orphan with no father), asufim (orphan with neither known parent; see Mishnah Kiddushin 4:1), and any [class of people] that are forbidden from marrying into the congregation are permitted to marry each other—words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehudah says: There are 4 congregations [that are all permitted to marry each other]—kohanim, levi'im, yisrael, converts, and anyone else [not in any of those 4 congregations] is allowed to marry each other. But Hakhamim say: There are 3 congregations—kohanim, levi'im, yisrael. Rabbi Eliezer says: Anyone who is forbidden to marry into the congregation—two people who each have certain status are permitted [to marry each other]; one person with certain status with one person with doubtful status, doubtful with certain and doubtful with doubtful are forbidden [to marry each other].
(These are those who are doubtful: shetuki, asufi and kuti.)(—missing in Ehrfurt manuscript, supplied from Mishnah Kiddushin 4:3). And so also Rabbi Elazar (sic! based on Ehrfurt) used to say: A mamzer can't marry a kutit, a kuti can't marry a mamzeret, and a kuti can't marry a kuti—so too with shetuki, asufi etc.
A male convert and freed slave are permitted [to marry] a mamzeret and the child is a mamzer—words of Rabbi Yoseh. Rabbi Yehudah says: A male convert can't marry a female convert. A male convert, freed slave and disqualified priest are permitted [to marry] a female priest. Which is [a person whose lineage is mixed like] dough (isah, see Mishnah Eduyot 8:3)? Anyone [with mixed lineage but] who doesn't have [any suspicion of having ancestors with] netinut, mamzerut or kings' slaves. Said Rabbi Meir: Anyone who doesn't have netinut, mamzerut or kings' slaves [in their heritage]—they can marry [the person] into the priesthood. Rabbi Shimon ben Lazar says in the name of Rabbi Meir, and so too Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya used to say the same: Why did they say that an isah is unfit [to marry] into the priesthood? Because of the possibility of disqualified priests [in his lineage] that they would become impure through—Jews know the netinim and mamzerim among them, but they don't know the disqualified priests among them.
A daughter of a male disqualified priest (halal) is disqualified from [marrying into] the priesthood forever. Rabbi (sic!, based on Ehrfurt manuscript) says: A daughter of a male convert is like the daughter of a male halal and disqualified from the priesthood. An isah is disqualified from the priesthood (see previous halakhah); if she [the isah] got married to a Yisrael, her daughter is fit [to marry into] the priesthood. A captive woman is disqualified from the priesthood; if she got married to a Yisrael, her daughter is fit for the priesthood. A freed handmaid is disqualified from the priesthood; if she is married to a Yisrael, her daughter is fit for the priesthood. It turns out that Yisrael is a mikveh for priests [since the daughter of a pesulah with a male Yisrael is no longer pesulah] and a handmaid is a mikveh for all disqualifications.
Netinim and mamzerim will be pure in the future to come—words of Rabbi Yoseh. Rabbi Meir says: They will not be pure. Rabbi Yoseh said to him: But doesn't it say "I will sprinkle upon you purifying waters and you will be made pure" (Yehezkel 36:25)? Rabbi Meir said to him: "From all your impurities and all of your abominations" (Yehezkel 36:25) [but not from your genealogical blemishes]. Rabi Yoseh said to him: What does the verse mean when it says "I will purify you"? [This seems extraneous and is thus able to teach about an additional impurity, that of genealogy, that God will purify us from:] even from netinim nd mamzerim.
A male Egyptian [convert] that marries a female Egyptian [convert], [or] a male Edomite [convert] that marries a female Edomite [convert]—the first and second generation is forbidden [from marrying into the congregation; see Devarim 23:9]; but the third is permitted. Said Rabbi Yehudah: Minyamin (sic! name in Ehrfurt manuscript) the Egyptian convert was havruta with one of the students of Rabbi Akiva. He said: "I am an Egyptian convert and I married an Egyptian convert. Behold I will go marry off my son to an Egyptian convert woman in order that my grandson should be fit to marry into the congregation, in order to fulfil what it says: "The third generation let them enter the congregation of God" (Devarim 23:9)." Rabbi Akiva said to him: "Minyamin you have erred in halakhah—Sanacherib, king of Assyria, came already and mixed up all of the nations; Ammonites and Moabites are not in their place, neither are Egyptians or Edomites in their place. Rather, a male Ammonite can marry a female Egyptian, a male Egyptian can marry a female Ammonite, and any one of these can marry anyone from any of the families of the earth, and any one of the families of the earth can marry any of these. It all depends on the child [whether he is able to marry into the community or not, since any of these people if they converted would be kosher Jews]."
A female Levite or female Yisrael—[one who seeks to marry them should] add upon them an additional one [generation on both sides that he should investigate to understand their lineage, 1 more than for a female Kohen], which is 12 [people to investigate]. (The following translated from the Ehrfurt manuscript:) If he investigated the mother, he does not need to investigate the children. If he investigated the adults, he does not need to investigate the minors. When does this apply? When [investigating a family that has] one wife. But when [the family has] 2 wives—if he investigated the mother, he needs to investigate the children; and if he investigated the adults, he needs to investigate the minors [because they might be born from different women].
(Translated from Ehrfurt manuscript:) A man who said: "My son is a mamzer", "My son is the son of a divorcee" or "the son of a halutzah (a woman whose levirate bond was broken with halitzah)", if [he said this] about a minor—he is believed; but about a major—he is not believed—words of Rabbi Yose. But Hakhamim say: Even if both of them (the man and woman) say that the foetus in her womb is a mamzer—they is not believed.
A man who went with his wife to the land beyond the sea, and he, his wife and his children came back, and he said: "The wife that went with me to the land beyond the sea—this is her and these are her children"—he needs to bring evidence neither about her nor about the children [to prove that they are his and hers]. "[The wife that went with me...] died, but here are her children"—he needs to bring evidence about the children but doesn't need to bring evidence about the wife. A woman/wife is believed when she says, "These are my children". (The following translated from the Ehrfurt manuscript:) A man is believed when he says: "The wife that I married in the land beyond the sea—this is her and these are her children"—he needs to bring evidence neither about the wife, nor about the children. "[I married a wife there but] she died, and these are her children"—he needs to bring evidence on both the wife and the children. A woman is believed when he says "These are my children."
(Translated from Ehrfurt manuscript:) One wife can be secluded with 2 men, even if both of them are kuti'im, even if both of them are slaves, even if one of them is a kuti and one of them is a slave, even if one of them is a minor, except for a minor with regard to whom he [the adult man] has no shame to have sex in his [the minor's] presence. But she should not be secluded with any Gentiles, even 100 [of them]. His sister, his mother-in-law and any other person with whom sex would be forbidden—he should not be secluded with them except on the basis of two [witnesses]. Rabbi Elazar says: A man who has a wife and children but doesn't live with them shouldn't teach children [Scripture]. Rabbi Yehudah says: A single man shouldn't shepherd small cattle, and two single men shouldn't sleep in one cloak. They said: Yisrael is not suspected of such [bestiality].
Rabbi Meir used to say: It is possible for a man and wife to raise 5 nations. How so? A man who (sic! reading Ehrfurt manuscript's מי against Vienna's גוי) has a male and female slave and they have 2 sons. One of [the sons] converts—behold one of them is a convert, one is a Gentile. Their master converts, he converts the slaves and they have a son—he is a mamzer. The female slave is freed and that slave has sex with her and they have a son—the child is a slave. They are both freed and have a son—the child is a freedman. It is possible for a man to sell to his father and pay his mother her ketubah. How so? A man who has a male and female slave and they have a son. He frees his female slave and marries her and writes his property to her son. He sells it to his father and pays his mother her ketubah.
Any man who is occupied with women/wives shouldn't be secluded with women/wives, e.g. those who sell nets, who sell flax or hatchelled wool, weavers, perfume sellers, tailors, barbers, launderers, whetters [of millstones]. (Translated from Ehrfurt manuscript:) Rabbi Meir says: There is no trade that passes from the world but woe to a man who sees his parents in an unfit trade. Rabbi says: A man should strive to teach his son a clean and easy trade, and pray to the One to Whom wealth belongs, for there is no trade that doesn't have in it poverty and wealth; this is to tell you that wealth and poverty doesn't come from trade [but from God].
(Translated from Ehrfurt manuscript:) Said Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar: Have you ever seen a wild or domesticated animal with a trade? They are supported without pain. They were only created to serve me, but I was created to serve my Creator. This is a kal va-homer: Just as they who were created only to serve me are supported without pain, I who was created to serve my Creator, isn't it logical that I should be supported without pain? Rather, I impair my deeds and I ruin my support.
(Translated from the Ehrfurt manuscript:) Rabbi Nehorai says: I abandoned every trade in the world and taught my children only Torah, for they eat the reward of its labour in this world but the principal remains for them in the world to come, because every trade in the world only stands for a man in his youth when his strength is upon him, but if he becomes sick, old or has troubles, he will not be able to do work and in the end will die in famine. But Torah keeps him from all evil in his youth and gives him a future and hope in his old age. In his youth, what does it say? "Those who hope in God, He will exchange for him strength, make his limbs rise like eagles" (Yeshayahu 40:31). In his old age, what does it say? "In old age they produce fruit" (Tehilim 92:15). And so too you find regarding Avraham our father, who God blessed in his old age more than in his youth, as it is said, "The time came when Avraham was old, and God blessed Avraham with everything (ba-kol)" (Bereishit 24:1). Rabbi Meir says: [The blessing was] that he didn't have a daughter. Rabbi Yehudah says: That he had a daughter. Rabbi Elazar ha-Moda'i says: This is the large sangenon (a kind of magical precious stone) that was in the hand of Avraham our father. Rabbi Shimon ben Yohai says: This is the beautiful jewel that hung around the neck of Avraham our father, that any sick person who saw it would immediately be healed. When Avraham our father died, God took it and hung it in the daytime. A second thing [that was his reward]: that Esav didn't rebel during his [grandfather's] lifetime. A third thing: that Yishmael did teshuvah during his [father's] lifetime. Others say: Avraham had a daughter and her name was Bakol. God blessed him in his old age more than in his youth because he did the Torah before it came, as it is said, "Because Avraham heard My voice and kept My charge, My commands, My laws, My instructions (torot)" (Bereishit 26:5)—it doesn't say "My Torah" (in singular) but "My instructions" (in plural), this teaches that the words of Torah and the words of scribes were revealed to him.
