Tractate Mezuzah



Chapter 1

The text of <b>mezuzot is not written on</b> parchment made of <b>skins of unclean</b> (i.e. non-kosher) <b>domestic animals or unclean wild animals, but it is written on</b> parchment made from <b>skins of dead</b> (i.e. not slaughtered in a way fit for eating) <b>or sick</b> (in a way that makes them unfit for eating) kosher animals. <b>And we are not concerned that perhaps the skins were pierced</b> at the animal’s heart.
<b>One must place the same size </b>margin <b>on all sides, as Rabbi Shimon Ben Elazar said.</b>
<b>If</b> the mezuzah parchment <b>was perforated in the location of the writing, it is invalid</b>; if <b>in an empty space, it is valid. If one wrote</b> the letter <b>vavs as zayins, zayins as vavs, regular</b> letters <b>as final ones, final ones as regular ones,</b> the paragraph separators <b>petucha as setuma, setuma as petucha, or if he mixed up its</b> other <b>letters or wrote them in</b> Paleo-<b>Hebrew</b> script, <b>it is invalid.</b>
<b>A storehouse for hay, a woodshed</b>, and <b>a</b> general <b>storehouse are exempt</b> from the requirement of mezuzah. <b>A cattle barn is exempt. If women make use of it</b> to adorn it, <b>it is obligated</b>, i.e. a mezuzah is required at its entrance. <b>Cone-shaped huts, watchtowers, field sheds, and tanneries  are exempt from mezuzah.</b>
<b>A bathhouse is exempt from mezuzah. If there is a dwelling in it that opens outside</b> this opening <b>is obligated.</b>
<b>A doorway in a corner only has one doorpost. A doorway made with boards</b> such that there is no clear doorpost, the wall just ends, <b>only has one doorpost. Such cases require</b> a mezuzah. <b>Rabbi Eliezer Ben Yaakov exempts them.</b>
<b>An arched gateway is exempted</b> from a mezuzah. <b>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda obligate it, but they all agree that if</b> the gateway <b>is a straight wall below</b> for at least ten tefachim <b>and the arch is above</b> that, then the arch <b>requires a mezuzah.</b>
<b>Gates of a city and gates of streets require</b> a mezuzah. <b>Gates of courtyards are exempt. The chambers in the Temple were exempt from mezuzah. The chamber that was</b> called <b>Beit HaParvah, which was the High Priest’s residence seven days a year, and Sukkot of potters require mezuzot. Rabbi Yossi exempts them.</b>

Chapter 2

<b>The mezuzah is written on</b> a scroll that is affixed on <b>the right side  at the entrance from the market to a gatehouse and at the exit from the courtyard to the gatehouse.</b>
If one has <b>a garden that has doorposts from the courtyard, he affixes</b> a mezuzah on the right <b>in the direction of <b>exiting the garden into the courtyard. And if there is a gatehouse</b> between the garden and the courtyard <b>he affixes</b> mezuzot entering the gatehouse <b>in both directions.</b></b>
Regarding <b>a small room</b> similar to a gatehouse that serves as an entrance <b>to a large room, we affix</b> the mezuzah on the right <b>in order</b> of size <b>from small to large</b>, unlike a gatehouse. <b>If all</b> the doorways to the room are <b>frequently used, one places</b> a mezuzah <b>on all of them.</b>
<b>Regarding two rooms next to each other</b> with a doorway between them <b>we affix<b> the mezuzah on the right side <b>as one enters</b> further inside the house, i.e. from the outer room to the inner room. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: if there is a movable ladder to all four sides</b> we affix mezuzot to them.</b></b>
<b>Regarding an entrance from the roof</b> into the house, <b>one affixes</b> a mezuzah <b>in the direction</b> of the house coming <b>from the roof. <b>Rabbi Nosson bRabi Yossi says</b> there are differing opinions regarding whether an entrance from the roof  needs a mezuzah. <b>Beit Shammai requires</b> one while <b>Beit Hillel exempts it.</b></b>
<b>Regarding</b> a permanent <b>sukkah inside the roof, one affixes</b> a mezuzah on the right <b>in the direction exiting from the sukkah to the roof. Rabbi Yossi says</b> entering <b>from the roof to the sukkah.</b>
<b>Regarding a portico inside</b> the house attached to <b>rooms from which there is no exit to anywhere else</b> except these rooms, thus making it an “inner” room, <b>one affixes</b> a mezuzah on the right <b>in the direction exiting from the portico into the houses. Rabbi Yossi says entering from the houses to the portico.</b>
<b>Regarding a doorway that is used as two doorways  with a pillar  a tefach</b> or less <b>wide</b> in the middle, <b>one affixes one mezuzah following the words of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> If the pillar is <b>wider than</b> a tefach, one affixes <b>two mezuzot.</b>
<b>The mezuzah is attached at half</b> the height of the doorpost <b>or above. These are the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says</b> it should be attached <b>at least one tefach below</b> the lintel <b>and at least one tefach above</b> the ground.
<b>If one dug</b> a groove <b>in the wall</b> next to a doorway less than <b>the width of a tefach and affixed</b> a mezuzah there <b>it is valid. More than that, it is invalid. If one dug a stick</b> and hung it in the entrance <b>and affixed</b> a mezuzah to it, <b>it is invalid. If one affixed</b> a mezuzah <b>to a tube and hung it</b> on the inside <b>behind the door</b> or on the outside <b>behind the doorpost, Rabbi Meir considers it valid, while Rabbi Yehuda invalidates it.</b>
<b>A new house requires a mezuzah as soon as it is completed</b> even though no one is living there yet.
<b>A resident of an inn in the Land of Israel requires a mezuzah after thirty days. A renter</b> in the Land of Israel <b>affixes</b> a mezuzah <b>immediately</b> upon moving in. <b>Outside the land</b> a resident of an inn <b>is exempt, and the renter affixes</b> a mezuzah <b>after thirty days.</b>
<b>One who rents a house from a non-Jew or a Cuthean affixes a mezuzah immediately, and when he moves out he takes it</b> with him. <b>One who rents from a Jew also affixes a mezuzah immediately, and once he does he cannot take it</b> with him.
<b>One who acquires a house from a non-Jew or a Cuthean is obligated</b> to affix <b>a</b> new <b>mezuzah</b> rather than rely on one already affixed to the doorway, since we cannot be sure it is valid. If he acquires it <b>from an Israelite, it is presumed</b> to be valid.
<b>One who acquires a doorframe from a non-Jew</b> as scrap for burning <b>does not light it until inspecting it</b> for a mezuzah that may have been left on it <b>because a mezuzah needs to be inspected once in 25 years. These are the words of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Yaakov says</b> we don’t inspect <b>for a long time</b>, i.e. there is now set inspection schedule. <b>But everyone agrees that if one moves it from place to place it needs to be examined. If those who use the water of a mikveh on public property go through</b> its door, the mezuzah [or possibly the mikvah] <b>must be inspected every seven years. If on private property, every 25 years. These are the words of Rabbi Meir. The Chachamim say it doesn’t matter</b> whether it’s public or private. Rather, <b>this is the rule: if many people immerse at the same time it must be inspected every seven years. If not, then it must be inspected every 25 years.</b>
