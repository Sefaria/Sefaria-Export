Tosefta Chagigah



Chapter 1

One who is impure is exempt from appearing [before the Temple on the three festivals], as it says (Deut. 12:5-6), "you are to come there and you are to bring there [your burnt-offerings and your sacrifices]." Since one must be [ritually] fit to enter the Temple Courtyard, consequently one who is impure, who is not fit to enter the Temple Courtyard[, is exempt from appearing].
Yochanan ben Dahavei says in the name of Rabbi Yehuda, Neither is a blind man [obligated to appear at the Temple on the Festivals], as it says (Ex. 23:17), "[All of your males] shall be seen," this excludes the blind. Rebbi answered the words of Yochanan ben Dahavei: The Sages decided to support the opinion of (סִיעַ) Rabbi Yehuda [in reliance upon] (1 Sam. 1:22), "Hannah did not ascend, because she said to her husband, 'When the child is weaned, [I will bring him, that he may appear before the Lord].""<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Just as a minor is not obligated until he can ascend independently, so too a blind person, who requires support to ascend the Temple, is not obligated to appear (see Chag. 6a:3).</i>
A minor that no longer needs [the help of] his mother is liable in [building a] sukkah. A minor that needs his mother may go out by means of his mother's eiruv (Ket. 65b:9), and if he does not need his mother, they make an eiruv of two meals for the joining of the Shabbat boundaries. [If] he knows how to shake, he is liable in [the commandment of] lulav. [If] he knows how to dress himself, he is liable in [the commandment of donning] tzitzit. [If] he knows how to talk, his father teaches him the Shema and the Torah and the holy tongue, and if not, it would have been preferable for him not to come into this world. [If] he knows how to take care of tefillin, his father buys him tefillin. <i>How so?</i> We examine him, we immerse him, and we give him chullin [which he is told] to treat as Terumah. [If] he knows how to take care of his body, we may eat foods that have touched his body. [If he is a Kohen and] he knows how to spread his hands [in the manner of the priestly blessing], we give him a portion [of the Terumah] from the threshing floor. [If] he possesses the intelligence to be questioned about a case involving doubt, in the private domain [the ruling is] "impure," and in the public domain [the ruling is] "pure" (see Sifrei Bamidbar 8). [If] he knows how to slaughter, his slaughter is valid. [If] he can eat an olive's worth of grain, we remove ourselves four <i>amot</i> from his excrement and urine. [If] he can eat an olive's worth of meat, we slaughter on his behalf the Passover offering. Rabbi Yehuda says, we never slaughter the Passover offering on his behalf unless he knows how to distinguish food. They said to him, what is meant by "distinguish food"? [He said to them,] anyone to whom we give an egg and he keeps it, [and we we give him] a stone and he throws it.
A girl that has two [pubic] hairs is liable in every commandment stated in the Torah, [and may perform] either <i>chalitzah</i> or levirate marriage. And so too a boy that has two hairs is liable in every commandment stated in the Torah, and is fit to be a rebellious son or a teacher. Once his beard fills in, he is fit to lead the congregation in prayer, to pass in front of the Ark, and to lift his hands [for the priestly blessing], but he does not receive a portion of consecrated [foods] from the Temple until he grows two hairs. Rebbi says, I say, until he is 20 years old, as it is said (Ezra 3:8), "And they appointed the Levites from 20 years and upwards to oversee the work of the House of God." 
Beit Shammai say, the value (lit., "the measure") of the appearance offering is greater than the value of the Festival offering, [because with respect to] the appearance offering, all of it ascends to the Most High"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., it is entirely burnt on the altar</i>, which is not the case with the Festival offering [which is eaten by the Kohanim and the owner]. And Beit Hillel say, the value of the Festival offering is greater than the value of the appearance offering, [because with respect to] the Festival offering, it applied before [the giving of] the Ten Commandments (see Ex. 5:1, and Lieberman here), and after [the giving of] the Ten Commandments, which is not the case with the appearance offering. Three commandments apply to the pilgrimages, and they are (1) the appearance offering, (2) the Festival offering, and (3) rejoicing. The appearance offering has something that the other two lack, and the Festival offering [has something] that the other two lack, and the [commandment of] rejoicing [has something] that the other two lack. [As to] the appearance offering, all of it ascends to the Most High, which is not the case with the other two. The Festival offering applied before the Ten Commandments and after the Ten Commandments, which is not the case with the other two. And [the commandment of] rejoicing applies to both men and women, and applies all seven days, which is not the case with the other two.
<i>What is the "appearance offering"?</i> They are the burnt offerings that are brought [at the time of] one's appearance [before the Temple]. <i>What is the "Festival offering"?</i> They are the peace offerings that are brought for the Festivals. If someone has [an animal] that can be brought [as an offering] within his home, behold, he brings that one, and if not, he joins up with others as long as [the portion] of each of them is not less than the proper measure of what is designated as "the Festival offering."
Said Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree on whether the burnt offerings that are brought daily [to the Temple] should only be brought from non-consecrated [animals], nor on whether [with respect to] peace offerings that are brought on the other days of the year (i.e., other than Festival days), that if one wants to rely upon [animals from] tithes, he may so rely. What they disagreed on was in regards to the Festival offerings [brought on] a Yom Tov itself. For Beit Shammai said, all of these must be brought from non-consecrated [animals], and Beit Hillel said, one brings an obligatory offering from non-consecrated [animals], but [thereafter] if he wants to rely upon tithes, he may so rely, and on the other days of the year, he brings obligatory offerings from non-consecrated [animals].
Israelites fulfill their obligation through vow offerings and freewill offerings, and with tithed animals. Kohanim [fulfill their obligation] through sin-offerings and guilt offerings, with first-born [livestock], and with breast and thigh [taken from peace offerings, see Lev. 9:21], but not from bird offerings and not from grain offerings. A Nazirite fulfills [his obligation] with his ram (see Num. 6:14), whether it belongs to him or whether it belongs to others, as long as he eats from the sacrifice all seven [days of the Festival].
We do not bring a thanksgiving offering on the Festival of Matzah (i.e., Passover), because of the chametz that is in it (see Lev. 7:13), nor on Shavuot because it is a Day of Slaughter"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>יום טבוח</b>, cf. Chag. 17b:2-6; alternatively, <b>יום טוב</b> ("[it is a] Festival"), see Beitzah 19b:2 and GR"A</i>, but it is brought on the Festival of Sukkot, and one fulfills his obligation [of bringing a Festival offering] with it. Rabbi Shimon says, we do not bring a thanksgiving offering on the Festival of Sukkot, because everything that is brought on the Festival of Matzah [also] is brought on the Festival of Shavuot and the Festival of Sukkot. [Thus] a thanksgiving offering, which is not brought on the Festival of Matzah is not brought either on the Festival of Shavuot or on the Festival of Sukkot. Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Shimon says, a thanksgiving offering <i>is</i> brought on the Festival of Sukkot, and one fulfills his obligation of rejoicing with it, but does not fulfill his obligations of [bringing a] Festival offering with it.
[If one of the three] pilgrimage festivals passed and one did not bring a Festival offering, he is not liable to bring it (Chag. 1:6), as it says (Ecc. 1:15), "What is crooked cannot be made straight [and what is lacking cannot be reckoned]." Rabbi Shimon ben Manasya says, he who steals from a person is able to return what he has stolen, [and] one who robs can return what he has robbed, [but] one who has sexual relations with a man's wife and [thereby] renders her forbidden is banished and departs from this world, and about this [person] it is said, "What is crooked cannot be made straight." Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai says, we do not say, "Inspect this camel lest it have a blemish!" [or] "Inspect [this] pig, lest it have blemish!" (since camels and pigs can never be "made straight," i.e., fit for sacrifice). Rather, we only inspect [kosher animals that are potentially] fit [for sacrifice]. <i>And what is this [thing that cannot be made straight]?</i> A Torah scholar who separated himself from the Torah, and about him it is said, "What is crooked cannot be made straight," and moreover it says (Ps. 37:21), "The wicked borrows and does not repay." Rabbi Yehuda ben Lakish says about him (i.e., a wayward Torah scholar), it says (Prov. 27:8), "Like a bird that wanders from its nest, [so too is a man who wanders from his home]," and moreover (Jer. 2:5), "What wrong did your fathers find in Me that they distanced themselves from Me, etc."
[The laws concerning] the dissolution of vows hover in the air and they have nothing to support them, but a wise man permits it according to his wisdom. The laws of Shabbat, the Festival offerings, and trespass are like mountains suspended by a single hair, [as their laws are set forth] only briefly in the Torah yet they have many halachot, which have nothing to support them. On account of this, Rabbi Yehoshua would say, "Tongs are fashioned from tongs, [but] the first tongs, how were they made?" [The laws of] judgments, of the Temple Service, of purity, and of impurity, of prohibited relations, as well as [the laws of] valuations, the dedications and the consecrations, there are many scriptural passages, midrash, and numerous halachot, and they have something to support them. Abba Yosei ben Chanan says, these are the eight foundations of the Torah that form the [essential] body of the halachot.

Chapter 2

They may not expound upon the subject of forbidden relations before three but they may expound before two, and they may not expound concerning the Work of Creation before two but they may expound before one (Chag. 2:1). They may not expound on the [Work of] the Chariot before one unless he is wise and understands of his own accord. A story of R. Yochanan ben Zakkai who was riding on his donkey and Rabbi Ele'azar ben Arakh was riding behind him. He said to him: "Rabbi, teach me one chapter concerning the Work of the Chariot. He said to him: "No. Have I not said to you from the beginning that one does not teach concerning the [Work of] the Chariot before one unless he is wise and understands of his own accord?" He said to him: "Now give me permission to expound before you." He said to him: "Speak!" Rabbi Ele'azar ben Arakh began to expound on the Work of the Chariot. Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai alighted from his donkey and wrapped himself in his tallit and the two of them sat on an outcropping of rock under an olive tree and he presented the subject before him. Rabbi Yochanan stood up and kissed him and said: "Blessed is Adonai, God of Israel, who gave a son to Abraham our father that knows and understands how to expound on the glory of our Father in Heaven!" There are those suited to expound and who are not suited to fulfill, those who are suited to fulfill and who are not suited to expound. Ele'azar ben Arakh is suited to expound and to fulfill. Happy is Abraham our father, that Ele'azar ben Arakh, who came forth from your loins, knows and understands well enough to expound on the glory of our Father in heaven!" Rabbi Yosi bar R. Yehuda says: "Rabbi Yehoshua expounded before R. Yochanan ben Zakkai, Rabbi Akiva expounded before Rabbi Yehoshua and Chananiah ben Chachinai expounded before Rabbi Akiva."
Four entered the orchard: Ben Azzai, Ben Zoma, <i>Acher</i> (i.e., Elisha ben Avuya), and Rabbi Akiva. One looked and died. One looked and was harmed. One looked and cut down the trees. And one went up in peace and went down in peace. Ben Azzai looked and died. Scripture says about him (Ps. 116:15): "Precious in the sight of the LORD Is the death of His saints". Ben Zoma looked and was harmed. Scripture says about him (Prov. 25:16): "Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee" and the continuation. [Cont. of the verse: "Lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it." Elisha looked and cut down the trees. Scripture says about him (Ecc. 5:5): "Suffer not thy mouth to bring thy flesh into guilt" etc. Rabbi Akiva went up in peace and went down in peace. Scripture says about him (Song of Songs 1:4): "Draw me, we will run after thee" etc. They gave a parable: What is this similar to? To the orchard of a king and there is an attic above it. It is upon [the man] to look so long as he does not move [his eyes] from it. Another parable was given. What is this similar tp? To [a street] that passes between two paths, one of fire, and one of snow. If it leans one way, it gets burned [by the fire]. If it leans the other way it gets burned by the snow. A man must walk in the middle and not lean to or fro. A story of Rabbi Yehoshua [who was walking in the street and Ben Zoma came opposite him], he reached him and did not greet him. He said to him [from where and to where] Ben Zoma? He said to him: I was watching the creation, and there is not between the upper waters and the lower waters even a handbreadth. As it is written (Gen. 1:2) "and the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters". And it says (Deut. 32:11): "As a vulture that stirreth up her nest" etc. Just as the vulture flies over the nest, touching and not touching, so too there is not even a handbreadth between the upper waters and lower waters. Rabbi Yehoshua said to his students: Ben Zoma is already outside. In a few days, Ben Zoma passed away.
Everyone who speculates upon four things, it would have been better that he had not come into this world: What is above, what is below, what came before, and what comes after (Chag. 2:1).  One might think [that one may speculate about what occurred] before the Act of Creation, [and thus] the verse states, "[Inquire of the first days,] from the day that God created man on Earth" (Deut. 4:32). [One might think that one may speculate about events] before the order of the seasons (סדרי תקופות) was established"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., before the creation of the sun and moon, see Lieberman</i>, [and thus] the verse states (<i>ibid.</i>), "[inquire] from one end of the heavens until [the other] end of the heavens" [but not about what occurred <i>before</i> the creation of heavens]. What is meant by the verse, "from the day that God created man on Earth"? From the day that God created man on the Earth, you may inquire. But you may not inquire about what is above, what is below, what was and what will be.
In their days (i.e., the days of the pairs), they only argued about the laying of hands (i.e., whether the owner of a peace offering must lean his hands against the animal before it is sacrificed, see Chag. 2:2). There were five pairs. Three of the first pairs said not to lay on hands and two of the last pairs said to lay on hands. Three were Nesi'im (princes) and two (of them) were the heads of courts, the words of R. Meir. R. Judah said Simon ben Shetah was Nasi (prince) and Judah ben Tabbai the head of the court. Said R. Yose: Originally there were no arguments in Israel. Rather, a 71 member court sat in the chamber of hewn stone (the Sanhedrin) and other courts of 23 existed in the cities of Erez Yisrael. And two courts of 3 apiece were in Jerusalem, one on the Temple Mount and one in Chayil. When one of them was necessary [a person] goes to the court in his city. No court (in his city)--[the person] goes to the court near his city. If they heard, they say to him; if not, he and their most distinguished member go to the court on the Temple Mount. If they heard, they say to him; if not, he and their most distinguished member go to the court in Hayil. If they heard they say to him; if not these and these arrive at the court in the chamber of hewn stone (And the court of the chamber of hewn stone even though it is 71, it can never have less than 23. If one of them needs to leave, he sees if there will be 23 he may leave; if not, he may not leave until there are 23. They would sit from the offering of the morning sacrifice until the offering of the afternoon sacrifice. And on Sabbaths and Festivals they would enter the Beit Midrash on the Temple Mount.) If they heard they say to them, and if not, they establish a quorum and take a roll. If the majority says impure it is impure. If the majority says pure it is pure. From there the Halakhah (law) goes out widespread in Israel. When there increased the students of Shammai and Hillel who did not properly apprentice, conflict increased in Israel and it became as though there were two Torahs (Sanh. 88b:7). And for there they would sit and inspect. Whoever was wise and humble and abundant and sin-fearing and mature and getting along with other people they make him a judge in his city. After being made a judge in his city they could elevate and set him on the Temple Mount and from there they could elevate and seat him in Chayil and from there they can elevate and seat him in the chamber of hewn stone and from there they sit and inspect the lineages of the priests and levites. A priest in whom has been found a blemish wears black and wraps in black, exits and leaves. One in whom not a blemish is found wears white and wraps in white, enters and serves with his brothers the priests. They would make a holiday that not a blemish was found among the children of Aaron. And he would bring a tenth of an Eifah of his own flour and do the service with his own hands even though it is not his priestly shift. A high priest and a regular priest who served before bringing their tenth of an Eifah their service is acceptable.
What is the "laying of hands" that Beit Shammai disagreed about? They say, "There is no laying of the hands on festivals, and [as to] peace offerings, he brings them and lays hands on them on the evening before the festival." [And] Beit Hillel says, "They bring peace offerings and burnt offerings and lay their hands on them [on the day of the festival]" (Chag. 2:2-3). Said Beit Hillel to Beit Shammai, "Since at a time that you do <i>not</i> permit commoners (non-priests) to perform [laying of the hands], you permit it to be performed for the Most High, thus, at a time that you <i>do</i> permit commoners to perform [laying of the hands], is is not logical that you should [certainly] permit it [to be performed] for the Most High?" Beit Shammai said to them, "Vows and freewill offerings are proof, since they are permitted to be performed by commoners but are not permitted for the Most High." Beit Hillel said to them, "No. If you are speaking of vows and freewill offerings, which do <i>not</i> have a fixed time, what would you say regarding festival offerings, which <i>do</i> have a fixed time?" Beit Shammai said to them, "However, there are instances that a festival offering has no fixed time, since if [one did not bring a festival offering] on the first Yom Tov of the festival, he [nonetheless] may celebrate the whole festival and on the last day [he brings it]." Abba Shaul would state a different version [of this exchange] in the name of Beit Hillel: "Since at a time when your stove is closed down, the stove of your Master is open, then at a time that your stove is open, would not the stove of your Master also be open?" Another version: "It is in order that your table not be full, while the table of your Master is empty."
It so happened with Hillel the Elder that he leaned his hands on the burnt offering in the Temple Courtyard, and the students of Beit Shammai joined together against him. [Seeking to avoid a confrontation,] he said to them, "You came and you saw that that she (i.e., the offering) is a female and we need to make her into a peace offering." He then engaged them with talk about other matters until they left, and immediately Beit Shammai gained the upper hand [over Beit Hillel], and they sought to establish the halacha according to their view. And among them was Bava ben Buta who was of the disciples of Beit Shammai, but he knew that the halacha was according to the words of Beit Hillel in every matter, and so he went and brought every sheep from Kedar, and stood them in the Temple Courtyard, and said, "Anyone who needs to bring a burnt offering or a peace offering may come and bring it." [And] they came and took the livestock and they offered them as burnt offerings, and leaned their hands on them. And it was on that day that the halacha was established to be according to the words of Beit Hillel, and no person challenged [Beit Hillel] on any matter. And later on, it so happened with one of the disciples of Beit Hillel who leaned his hands on a burnt offering in the Temple Courtyard, that one disciple among the disciples of Beit Shammai found him [and] said to him, "What is this leaning of hands?" [The disciple of Beit Hillel] said to him, "What is this silence?"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">in other words, "Why are you not staying silent since the halacha has been established?"</i>. [And thus] he silenced him with a rebuke.
[If] Shavuot fell on a Monday or on a Thursday or on a Friday or on a Sunday, [or] on any day of the week, Beit Shammai say, the "day of slaughter" is the next day. Beit Hillel say, there is no "day of slaughter" [rather, sacrifices are brought on Shavuot itself]. It so happened that Alexander (alt., "Alexa") died in Lod and the people of all the surrounding towns came to eulogize him. Rabbi Tarfon said to them, "Leave at once! We do not eulogize on a Festival!" 

Chapter 3

What is the "presumption" (i.e., the presumption of purity following immersion, see Chag. 2:6-2:7)?  One who has removed [one of] his feet from the waters [of immersion] and still has [one of] his feet in the waters of immersion, [if he had intended to purify himself] for a light matter, he may strengthen himself [to change his intention to a] stringent  matter, and what he has done is done"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., although Sages do not approve of his change in intention, the immersion is nonetheless deemed valid for the stringent purpose</i>. One who immerses in order to raise himself from impurity to purity, behold, he is pure in everything. One who immerses, if he intends it, he is pure, and if not, he is impure, but as to one who immerses his hands -- either way, his hands are pure. Rabban Gamaliel would eat unconsecrated foods prepared in a state of purity all the days of his life, but his apron [nevertheless] possessed midras-impurity"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the impurity conveyed by leaning on or moving an object</i> vis-a-vis consecrated foods. Onkeles the Convert would eat foods prepared in a state of purity [applicable] to consecrated foods all the days of his life (i.e., following his conversion), but his apron [nevertheless] possessed midras-impurity vis-a-vis [the waters of] purification.
There is a greater stringency with consecrated foods than with Terumah: That they immerse utensils [inside other utensils (see GR"A)], cups inside cups, [and] serving platters inside serving platters with respect to [purifying items used for cooking and serving] Terumah, but not with respect to [purifying items for use with] consecrated foods. With respect to consecrated foods, [everything] is placed inside a basket or inside a <i>gorgotni</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>גורגותני</b>, a very large basket normally used for straining wine (see Minchat Yitzchak)</i>, and he immerses it [all at once]. Abba Shaul says, that is what we used to do with Terumah, but not with consecrated foods. The outer parts (<i>achuraim</i>) and the inner part and handle [of a vessel are considered separate] with regards to Terumah, but not with regards to consecrated foods (Chag. 3:1). Said Rabbi Yosei, this word (<i>achuraim</i>) is the dual form, [and thus we may deduce] that anything that has outer parts and an inner part must also have a handle [that is considered separate for purposes of purity], and anything that lacks outer parts and an inner part does not have a [separate] handle.
One who carries [an object that has] midras-impurity may [still] carry Terumah but may not carry consecrated foods (Chag. 3:1). <i>How is this done?</i> [If] he had impure sandals, he may carry a jug of Terumah [wine] on his shoulders, but he may not do so with consecrated foods. The clothes of those who eat Terumah are [deemed to possess] midras-impurity vis-a-vis consecrated foods. And the rule of consecrated foods is not like the rule of Terumah. The rule of consecrated foods is greater than the rule of Terumah, since with consecrated foods he [purifies his clothing by first untying any knots and then] immersing and drying [the clothing], and afterwards he reties [any knots], but with Terumah he may [first] tie [the knots] and afterwards immerse them. The same [rule applies to] consecrated foods of the Temple and to consecrated foods of the outlying areas in this regard.
Utensils [whose manufacture] is completed in purity -- even in the Temple Courtyard -- need to be immersed [in order to be fit to use] for consecrated foods, but not for Terumah. <i>How is this?</i> [Consecrated] flour that was mixed, and a tevul yom (i.e., one who has immersed but remains impure until sunset) touched a small [part] of it -- the whole is disqualified. [But] with Terumah, it is not [completely] disqualified; only the part that was touched. The ground does not join either consecrated foods or Terumah; [however,] the vessel joins with what is inside it for purposes of [disqualifying] consecrated foods, but not for Terumah. Consecrated foods [are rendered impure up to] the fourth degree, but Terumah [only up to] the third degree, and with Terumah, if one of his hands is rendered impure, the other remains pure, but with consecrated foods, both must be immersed as one. One does not immerse the pure one on its own and the impure one on its own, but rather immerses both of them as one.
One who immerses one of them (i.e., his hands), and prepares tahorot<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., food that must be prepared while in a state of purity</i>: All the tahorot that he [attempted to] prepare in a state of purity before he immersed both of them are [deemed] impure, since one hand renders the other impure to thereby render the consecrated food impure, the words of Rebbi. Rabbi Yosei son of Rabbi Yehuda says, [the rule should rather be formulated as,] "to render the consecrated food <i>disqualified</i>." They may eat dry food with unclean hands with respect to Terumah, but not with respect to consecrated food (Chag. 3:3). Said Rabbi Chanina ben Antigonos, is there really such a thing as "dry consecrated food"? Rather, he sticks a reed or a wood chip inside a <i>chararah</i>"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>חֲרָרָה</b>, a dry, thick cake baked on coals (see Jastrow)</i> and he may eat an olive or an onion with it (i.e., instead of using his hands), as to Terumah, but not as to consecrated food.
There is a greater stringency with regards to consecrated food [of sacrifices] and Terumah than with regards to the [waters of] purification [containing the ashes of the red heifer], since everyone is believed regarding [the purity status of the waters of] purification, but not everyone is believed as to [the purity status of] consecrated foods or Terumah. There is greater stringency with regards to the [waters of] purification, which is that one who is pure [with respect to the waters of purification] is impure with respect to consecrated food and Terumah, and there is no than with the purity of consecrated food and Terumah. There is a "counting" with respect to consecrated food and Terumah (i.e., 3rd- and 4th- level impurity), but there is no "counting" as to the [waters of] purification. A mourner is forbidden [to partake] in tithes but permitted [to partake] in Terumah and in [the purification rite involving] the red heifer. A tevul yom (i.e., one who has immersed but remains impure until sunset) is forbidden in Terumah but permitted in tithes and in the red heifer. One who lacks atonement (i.e., who has not yet brought a sacrifice) is forbidden in the red heifer but permitted in tithes and in Terumah.
Said Rabbi Yosei, from where [is it derived that] the consecrated food [of sacrifices] is rendered disqualified through fourth-degree impurity (see Chag. 3:2)? It is a logical deduction: If one who lacks atonement is not disqualified from [partaking of] Terumah [but is disqualified from consecrated food which carries] fourth-degree impurity, [then with respect to] one who is disqualified as to Terumah [which carries only third-level Terumah], is it not logical that he would [also] be disqualified from consecrated foods? We have learned third-degree impurity from what is written [in the Torah], and fourth-degree impurity from a <i>kal v'chomer</i> (<i>a fortiori</i> reasoning).
Said Rabbi Nechemiah, why is everyone trusted as to [the purity of the articles involved in] the purification rite [involving the red heifer] and as to consecrated food"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>נאמנין על בהחטאת ועל הקדש</b>, not <b>נאמנין &lt;לא&gt; על הקדש ולא על התרומה</b> ("trusted <i>neither</i> as to consecrated foods nor as to <i>Terumah</i>") (see Lieberman)</i>, but not everyone is trusted as to Terumah? So that people will not say, "I will build an altar for myself," or "I will burn a red heifer for myself," as it is said (Num. 18:7), "And you (=Aaron) and your sons with you shall safeguard your priesthood in every matter [regarding] the Altar..." (See Chag. 22a:15.) One might say that [the word "safeguard" includes] even [Terumah,] Terumat Ma'aser and Challah<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">the priestly portion taken from a Levite's tithes and the portion of dough set aside for the Kohen, respectively</i>, [and thus] the Torah comes to teach "... and to [that which is] within the Curtain." What is special about that which is "within the Curtain" is that it is not familiar to [the non-priestly class of] Israelites [who are forbidden from entering the area beyond the Curtain], which thus excludes Terumah and Terumat Ma'aser and Challah, with which Israelites are familiar. Rabbi Yehuda says, behold, it says [in regards to the red heifer] (Num. 19:9), "and it shall be for the congregation of the Children of Israel to safeguard it as the waters of purification...", such that everyone should be trusted as to safeguarding it. [If there is] a doubt as to the status of an am ha'aretz<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., one who is not generally trusted to adhere to laws of purity or tithing</i> as regards to [the impurity of] treading or movement [of a zav<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., one who has experienced an abnormal discharge</i>], [they are deemed] pure as to matters of chullin and impure as to matters of Terumah.
They may fill up and consecrate the waters of purification in anything. They may bring the waters of purification and the ashes of purification from place to place. An am ha'aretz who said "I am pure by [virtue of the waters of] purification" -- we accept him. [If ame'i ha'aretz said] "These utensils are pure by [virtue of the waters of] purification," we accept them (i.e., the vessels) from them. [If] he immersed himself in order to sprinkle [the waters of purification] but he did not sprinkle, behold, he may eat Terumah in the evening. [If] they saw in his hand the waters of purification and ashes of purification, they may eat tahorot (foods prepared in purity) over him, and over his clothes, and over his sandals.
An am ha'aretz that brings utensils for his purification, a chaver<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., one who is strict in matters of purity, see Dem. 2:3</i> may buy them from him for [purposes of] the purification rite as well as for [purposes of separating and storing] his Terumah. [If] he brought [utensils] for his Terumah, a chaver may not buy them from him neither for the purification rite nor for his Terumah. A chaver who said to an am ha'aretz, "Bring utensils for [my] purification," the chaver may buy them from him for his purification and for his Terumah. [If he said, "Bring utensils for] my purification," the chaver may not buy them from him, neither for his purification nor for his Terumah. [If he said,] "Bring [utensils] for my purification and for my Terumah of purification," the chaver may buy them from him, whether for himself or for someone else, as long as he did not try to circumvent the law [by going to an am ha'aretz]. And if he did try to circumvent the law, behold, they (i.e., the utensils and the items with which they came in contact) are impure. An am ha'aretz that said, "I brought these utensils for my purification, and I decided to use them for my Terumah," since they had been left alone with an am ha'aretz for a period of time [after he changed his mind and redesignated them], behold, they are impure.
From Modi'im and inwards [all potters] are believed as to [the purity of] small earthenware vessels [intended] for consecrated foods. From Modi'im and outwards, they are not believed. In Judea, [winemakers] are believed as to the purity of wine and oil every day of the year, but not about [the purity of] Terumah during the season of wine-pressing and olive-pressing<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">lit., "the time of the vat and the olive-press"</i>. [There are] seventy days that they are believed about [the purity status of] consecrated foods and about <i>medumma</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., a forbidden mixture of chullin and Terumah</i>, and about [the purity of] the <i>kankan</i> (a storage vessel for wine or oil), but not about Terumah. During the season of wine-pressing and olive-pressing, they are even believed about Terumah. They are believed about wine during the season of wine [production], and about oil during the season of oil [production], but not about wine during the season of oil [production], and not about oil during the season of wine [production]. Once the [season of] wine-pressing and oil-pressing passes, they return to being forbidden. [If] they brought him a wine jug of Terumah, he should not accept it from them, unless he said to him, "I have a <i>revi'it</i> of consecrated [wine] inside of it." [But if] he (i.e., the seller) brought it to the next winepress, even though he knows that this is the one (i.e., the same wine jug), he should not accept it from him. It so happened with Rabbi Tarfon that he was walking down the road and an old man happened upon him. He said to him, "Why is it that they 'sing your praises'? Is it not so that all your words are true and upright, but that you [nevertheless] accept Terumah on all the other days of the year from any person?" Said Rabbi Tarfon, "I will bury my sons if I don't have a halacha in my hands [directly] from Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai, who said to me, you are permitted to accept Terumah on all the other days of the year from any person. Now [that] they are murmuring against me (see Jastrow, רנן), I shall [therefore] restrict myself from [my custom of] receiving Terumah on all the other days of the year from any person, unless he [declares that he] has inside [his wine jug] a <i>revi'it</i> of consecrated [wine]."
If tax collectors entered a house and wrote on the outside [that] everything that is in the house is [ritually] pure, they are believed as to the purity of [articles involved in] the purification rite [of the red heifer], but they are not believed about the purity of Terumah, and in Jerusalem they are believed as to the purity of all the consecrated utensils but not about Terumah, and during the season of the pilgrimmage festival, [they are even believed] about Terumah. One who buys utensils from am ha'aretz skilled craftspersons, and one who sells utensils to am ha'aretz skilled craftspersons are believed about the purity of [articles involved in] the purification rite, but are not believed about the purity of Terumah.
If the table [for the showbread] became impure, one immerses it at its time, and even on the Sabbath. It so happened that someone immersed the [Temple] menorah on a Festival, and there were Sadducees who said [mockingly], "Come and see the Pharisees, who [would even] immerse the light of the moon!"
