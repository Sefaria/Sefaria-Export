Tosefta Pesachim



Chapter 1

 On the evening of the fourteenth, we check for chamets by candlelight, not by sunlight, not by moonlight, but rather only by candlelight (since the candlelight is greater). Even though there's no explicit proof for this, it's a remembrance for that which is discussed (Tzefaniah 1) "And in that time I will look through Jerusalem by candle" and that which it says (Proverbs 20) "The candle of God is a human soul".
Bet Shamai say: "Two rows on the entire cellar -- the outer row which faces the door, and the uppermost which faces the ceiling. [but the lower rows and the inner rows don't need checking]." Bet Hillel say: "[The outer row is] the uppermost which faces the door and those under it. However the rows that are more inwards from it don't need checking".
Holes in the upper and lower [walls of] the house, the mattress, and the cellar, and the roof of the house, and the roof of a closet, [and] the grain storage, [and] the cowshed, and the woodshed, and the storerooms -- [specifically,] the wine storeroom and the oil storeroom and the produce storeroom -- there is no need to check. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, [if] a couch is separated from the house<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., it is raised up such as to create a storage area under it</i> and there was wood or stones under it,  one checks the outer side but there is no need to check the inner side.
One who departs with a caravan or sets sail on a ship more than thirty days [before Passover] does not need to search [for chametz], [but one who departs or sets sail] within thirty days searches, and removes them (i.e., the pieces of chametz), and [then] goes on his way.
Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabban Gamaliel, two disqualified loaves of thanksgiving offering (see Lev. 7:12-14) were placed on top of the Temple portico. As long as they were placed [on top of the portico], everyone could eat unconsecrated food [containing leaven]. When one was removed, everyone (i.e., the Kohanim) could eat Terumah [containing leaven]. When both were taken away, they burned this one and that one (i.e., unconsecrated food and Terumah). They burned uncertain Terumah (i.e., Terumah whose purity status is uncertain), impure [Terumah], and pure [Terumah] all together, the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, uncertain [Terumah was burned] by itself, and pure by itself, and impure by itself. Said Rabbi Shimon, Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua did not disagree about the pure or about the impure [Terumah], whether we burn this one by itself and that one by itself. About what did they disagree? About uncertain [Terumah] and about impure [Terumah], for Rabbi Eliezer says, this one is burned by itself and that one is burned by itself, and Rabbi Yehoshua says, both [are burned] together. Said Rabbi Yosei, the conclusion does not follow from the proof. [What is the proof?] Meat that was rendered impure by a secondary source of impurity [and then made contact] with meat that was rendered impure by a primary source of impurity, both of them are impure, only that this one is possesses a higher degree of impurity, and that one possesses a lower degree of impurity. And so too with oil that became disqualified [through contact with] a <i>tevul yom</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., one who has immersed himself but remains impure until sunset</i> or [by contact] with a candlestick that was rendered impure through death-impurity -- both of them are impure, only that this one is possesses a higher degree of impurity, and that one possesses a lower degree of impurity. And I say that Terumah that became impure through a secondary source of impurity is burned along with Terumah that became impure through a primary source of impurity, even though we are adding impurity onto impurity. And [with respect to] uncertain [Terumah] and impure [Terumah], I say that if the uncertain is burned along with the impure, its impurity is removed from it. Beit Shammai say, we do not burn pure meat with impure meat, but Beit Hilel permit it.
At first they (i.e., the Sages) would say, we may not sell our chametz to a Gentile, nor may we give it to him as a gift; rather, we may [only] give it to him as food before the time for removal arrives. Until Rabbi Akiva came along and taught that we <i>may</i> sell it or give it as a gift [to a Gentile], and even after the time for removal [arrives]. Said Rabbi Yosei, those were the words of Beit Shammai, and these are the words of Beit Hillel, and Rabbi Akiva established [the halacha] according to the words of Beit Hillel.
One who eats chametz after midnight or chametz which remained with him during Passover -- behold, he has violated a negative commandment, but he is not excommunicated, the words of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Sages say, whatever does not result in excommunication does not involve [the violation of] a negative commandment. One who eats an olive's-bulk of chametz on Passover [intentionally] is liable for the punishment of excommunication, but [if he did so] unintentionally, [he is liable for] a sin offering, and [if he did so] without knowing, [he is liable for] a dependent sin offering.
One who eats Terumah [containing] chametz on Passover does not pay its monetary value in wood to a Kohen. Said Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri, "I said to Rabbi Akiva, for what reason does one who eats Terumah [containing] chametz on Passover not pay its monetary value in wood to a Kohen? What is the difference between this and the other days of the year? For on the other days of the year, one pays the monetary value in wood to a Kohen." He said to me, "No. If you say that on the other days of the year that [a Kohen] is not permitted to eat [impure Terumah] but is permitted to burn it, you must also say the same regarding [eating Terumah with chametz on Passover], for it is neither permitted to be eaten nor burned." How is this similar to the case of Terumah of strawberries and watermelons and cucumbers that became impure? Because these neither are permitted to eat nor permitted to be burned [as they are unfit for firewood]. <i>To what case does this apply?</i> To Terumah as to which one separated chametz before Passover, it is designated as Terumah, but one who separated Terumah [containing] chametz on Passover, it is not Terumah.
One who eats consecrated chametz on Passover, it is not Terumah. One who eats consecrated chametz on Passover inadvertently, he pays the principal and a fifth, and [brings] a certain guilt offering and a dependent guilt offering. [If he does so] intentionally, he is exempt [from bringing an offering; rather, he is excommunicated]. <i>To what case does this apply?</i> To consecrated [foods] from which chametz was separated before Passover, it is [indeed] consecrated, but one who consecrates chametz on Passover, it is not consecrated.
One who ears [chametz] and one who anoints with or drinks [chametz]: The one who eats [chametz], if from the time he started eating until the time he finished eating, he ate the quantity of a loaf [even if he paused in between], then the acts of eating combine [to render him liable], and if not then they don't combine. The one who drinks, if from the start of his drinking to the end of his drinking he drank a quarter-log [of liquid containing chametz], the acts of drinking combine together, and if not they do not combine. Just as eating requires an olive's-bulk [to render one liable], so too does drinking require an olive's-bulk, and eating and drinking do not combine. If he ate an olive's-bulk [of chametz], even if it was from five different foods [which he ate at one sitting, even if none of them contained an olive's- bulk on its own], they combine together. But if he ate half an olive's-bulk and then [stopped eating and later] came back and ate another half,  then even if both acts of eating were from the same type of food, they do not combine [and he is exempt from liability].
 The chametz of Gentiles is permitted immediately after Passover. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel and Rabbi Yishmael bar Rabbi Yochanan ben Berokah say, even consecrated [chametz] is permitted immediately after Passover.

Chapter 2

The chametz of Samaritans -- from what point is it permitted [for a Jew to eat it] after Passover? [With respect to the chametz of] homeowners (i.e., private citizens), three weeks for baked [chametz]; and with respect to] professional bakers, three days in the villages, and in walled cities not before three "ovens" (i.e., once the oven has been used three times after Passover). Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: When they (i.e., the Sages) said that [the chametz of Samaritan] homeowners [can be eaten] after three weeks of baking -- if there were a lot of children in the house or if he had prepared a feast for his son,<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Note: The translation of "if there ... his son" follows the GR"A's emendation, <b>הרבה בני הבית או שעשה משתה לבנו</b></i> and [the homeowner] baked three "ovens" one after another, it is permitted. And when they said that [the chametz of] professional bakers in the villages [is permitted] after three days -- if [the baker] was pressed [to bake a significant amount immediately after Passover] and baked three "ovens" one after another, [then] even on the first day it is permitted. Rabbi Shimon says, even when they said that [the chametz] of professional bakers in walled cities is [permitted] once [they have baked] three "ovens," it is forbidden until three days [have passed], since in the morning he prepares<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>בּוֹרֵר לוֹ</b> not <b>בודק לו</b>, see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Avodah_Zarah_5.11.4" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Avodah_Zarah_5.11.4">Y. Avodah Zarah V.11.4</a>)</i> sourdough for the whole day. In what case does this apply? When [the Samaritan] did not partake of the Paschal lamb with a Jew or if he [celebrated Passover] one day earlier<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., if the Samaritans calculated Rosh Chodesh Nissan as occurring one day earlier (see Minchat Yitzchak)</i>, but if he partook of the Paschal lamb with a Jew or if he restrained himself [from chametz] for one [additional] day after the [custom of the] Jews, his chametz is permitted immediately after Passover.
The matzah of the Samaritans is permitted, and a person fulfills his obligation on Passover [with it]. But Rabbi Eliezer forbids it because [according to him,] they are not learned in the details of the mitzvah. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, every mitzvah that the Samaritans accepted upon themselves -- they are more scrupulous in it[s observance] than a Jew.
The chametz of [Jewish] transgressors is permitted immediately after Passover, because they [are nonetheless trusted to] replace their sourdough [with the sourdough of Gentiles<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see Minchat Yitzchak here</i>]. [With respect to] provisions belonging to a Jew, or [a store belonging to a Jew with] Gentile workers who work inside of it, and chametz was found inside of it after Passover -- it is forbidden to benefit from it and, needless to say, to eat it.
[With respect] to a store owned by a Gentile, and Jewish workers are working inside it, and they found chametz in it after Passover -- it is permitted to eat it and, needless to say, to benefit from it. {A store owned by a Jew and Gentile workers are working inside of it, and they found chametz inside of it after Passover, it is forbidden to benefit from and, needless to say, to eat it. A store owned by Gentiles and Jewish workers are working inside of it, and they found chametz inside of it after Passover, it is permitted to eat and, needless to say, to benefit from it.}<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Note: Per the commentators, the section bracketed by "{}" should be deleted, as it repeats the previous material.</i>
[If] a Gentile lent [money] to a Jew on his chametz (i.e., using the Jew's chametz as collateral, see Pes. 2:3), and he said to him, "If I don't come before Passover [to claim my chametz], behold, it is sold to you," [then] after Passover it is permitted to eat it and, needless to say, to benefit from it. A Jew who lent [money] to a Gentile on his chametz, and he said to him, "If I don't come before Passover [to claim my chametz], behold it is sold to you," [then] after Passover it is forbidden to benefit from it and, needless to say, to eat it.
A Gentile who came to the house of a Jew and had chametz in his hand -- it is not incumbent upon him to remove it [from his house]. [But if the Gentile] deposited [the chametz] with him, he is required to remove it. [If the Jew] designated [a room in] his house [for the chametz to be deposited] by itself, it is not incumbent upon him [to remove it]. A Jew and a Gentile that were traveling on a ship and the Jew had chametz in his hand, behold, he may sell it to the Gentile, or he may give it to him as a gift and then return and buy it back from him after Passover, as long as he [initially] gave it to him as an irrevocable gift.
A Jew is authorized to say to a Gentile, "Before you take this <i>maneh</i> (currency equivalent to one hundred shekels) [of chametz] as a gift, take two hundred and if I need it I will come and take it from you after Passover.
A Jew may hire out his donkey to a Gentile to transport chametz from place to place. § [If after Passover a Jew] found chametz on the road, if [it is in a place where permitted] chametz predominates<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., in a place where the majority are Jews and thus the chametz may be presumed to have been baked after Passover (see Lieberman here)</i>, it is permitted, and if not, it is forbidden.
It so happened with Rabban Gamaliel that he was travelling from Akko to Cheziv.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">As the narrative will reveal, Rabban Gamaliel was traveling after the conclusion of Passover, accompanied by Rabbi Ilai and by his servant Tabi.</i> He found a loaf [of bread] on the road. He said to his servant Tabi, "Take this loaf." Thereafter, he saw a Gentile [and] he said to him, "Mabgai, take this loaf." Rabbi Ilai ran after [Magbai and] said to him, "Where are you from?" He said to him, "From the guard-tower villages" (see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Avodah_Zarah_1.9.3" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Avodah_Zarah_1.9.3">Y. Avodah Zarah I.9.3</a>, Guggenheimer tr.). He said to him, "What is your name?" He said to him, "Magbai," He said to him, "Do you happen to know Rabban Gamaliel?" He said to him, "No." From this we learned that Rabban Gamaliel was directed by the Holy Spirit.  We learned three things: We learned that the chametz of a Gentile is permitted immediately after Passover, and that one should never pass by food [without picking it up], and that we follow after the majority of the travelers on the roads. They arrived in Cheziv, and someone came and asked him about [annulling] his vow. He said to the one who was with him (i.e., Rabbi Ilai), "Did we not drink a quarter-<i>log</i> of Italian wine?" He said to him, "Yes." He said to him (i.e., the one seeking dissolution of his vow), "In that case, come walk with us until the wine dissipates inside of us." He walked with them until the Ladder of Tyre. Once they had arrived at the Ladder of Tyre, [Rabban Gamaliel] dismounted from his donkey, wrapped himself [in his cloak], and sat down, and dissolved his vow. And we learned many things on that day. We learned that a quarter-<i>log</i> of wine make one drunk, and that walking dissipates [the effect of] wine, and that one who has drunk wine should not provide instruction, and that vows are not dissolved while riding or while walking  or while standing, but only while wrapped [in a cloak] and sitting.
Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri says, even with <i>keramit</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., a type of wild wheat (see Pes. 35a:11, Steinsaltz tr.)</i> does a person fulfill his obligation [to eat unleavened bread] on Passover. They fulfill [their obligation] with second tithe in Jerusalem but not with first fruits. <i>What is the difference between second tithe and first fruits?</i> Second tithe is permitted to eat in the outlying areas, but first fruits are not permitted to eat in the outlying areas.
They fulfill [their obligation of eating unleavened bread] with a wafer soaked [in water] or with a boiled [wafer] that has not [yet] dissolved (Pes. 41a:12, Steinsaltz tr.),the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei says, they fulfill [their obligation] with a soaked wafer but not with a boiled [wafer], even though it has not [yet] dissolved. They fulfill [their obligation] with sponge-cakes baked by [the heat of the] fire, but they do not fulfill [their obligation] with sponge-cakes baked by [the heat of the] sun. They may not bake sponge-cakes by [the heat of the] sun on Passover.
They fulfill [their obligation of eating unleavened bread] with Syrian cakes (which are thicker loaves), whether shaped into figures or whether not shaped into figures. But they may not make Syrian cakes shaped into figures on Passover [itself]. Said Rabbi Yehuda, Boethus ben Zonin asked the the Sages, "Why is it that we can't make Syrian cakes shaped into figures on Passover?" They said to him, "Because it takes a woman significant time making them, and [the dough] becomes leavened [during that time]." He said to them, "In that case, we could form them using a mold [which would take less time]." They said to him, "People would say, all Syrian cakes are forbidden, [but] the Syrian cakes of Boethus are permitted." Rabbi Yosei says, they may make Syrian cakes if they are prepared like thin wafers, but they may not make Syrian cakes prepared like [thick] loaves.
They do not fulfill [their obligation of eating unleavened bread] with <i>chalut</i> (dough kneaded with hot water), nor with <i>meisah</i> (flour mixed with boiling water, see Hallah 1:6), and not with sponge-cakes (contra Tos. Pesachim 2:11), and not with honey-cakes, but he may fill his belly with them [on Passover night] provided that he eats [at least] an olive's-bulk of matzah after doing so. They fulfill [their obligation] with spiced matzah, whether it was spiced in a stew-pot or whether it was spiced in cooking pot. They [also] fulfill it with <i>chararah</i> (a thin cake baked on coals), and with old matzah (matzah baked 30 days or more before Passover, see Minchat Yitzchak here), as long it was made from the start for the sake of Passover (i.e., one had the obligation in mind).
Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says, they fulfill [the obligation of eating bitter herbs] with lettuce (חזרת) and with mustard. Rabbi Yishmael bar Rabbi Yochanan ben Berokah says, one does not fulfill [the obligation] with anything that burns [the mouth]. Rabbi Yehuda says, anything that makes one pale fulfills it. They fulfill it either with wet or dry [bitter herbs]. Rabbi Meir says, [rather,] "they <i>even</i> fulfill it with dry [bitter herbs]." Rabbi Tzadok says, [rather,] "they even fulfill it with <i>pickled</i> [bitter herbs]."
The [bitter] lettuce and the matzah and the Passover offering are obligated on the first night of the [Passover] Festival, and on the remaining nights [partaking of them] is optional. Rabbi Shimon says, it is an obligation for men but optional for women. Hillel the Elder would wrap all three of them together and eat them. <i>From what time are they eaten?</i> They are eaten once it gets dark. [If] he did not eat them once it got dark, he may eat them [at any time during] the whole night. [If] he did not eat them [at any time during] the whole night, he cannot eat them from then on. The [bitter] lettuce and the matzah and the Passover offering -- one does not prevent fulfillment [of the obligation] of the other.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">For example, one who lacks bitter herbs can still fulfill the mitzvot of matzah and the Passover offering.</i>

Chapter 3

Dough [lodged] in the cracks of the kneading bowl (Pes. 3:2): [If] it was done (i.e., lodged in the cracks) in order to strengthen [the trough], it does not interpose [and is considered to be part of the trough], and if not, it does interpose [and must be removed]. If there is an olive's-bulk in one place: In either case (i.e., whether it interposes or does not interpose), he must remove it [from his premises before Passover]. [If] there was half an olive's-bulk here and half an olive's-bulk there, and there was [dough] like a rope in the middle [connecting the two halves]: If he takes out all three of them (i.e., the two half-olive-bulks and the connecting dough) as one, behold, he needs to remove them, and if not (i.e., if he lifts them out one by one), there is no need to remove [them].
Tanners' bowls into which flour is placed [as part of the tanning process (see Pes. 45b:19)], [if the flour was placed there less than] three days before Passover, behold, he needs to remove [the flour]. Others say, once he placed hides inside [the bowl], there is no need to remove it [since the flour is no longer edible]. An eye salve<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>קִילּוּר</b> not <b>קלור</b> (see Minchat Bikkurim)</i> or a compress or a plaster into which flour is mixed, there is no need to remove it. A poultice [containing flour] that became putrid, there is no need to remove it. The <i>chamasit</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">=<b>חמסית</b>, a mustard-like plant (see Minchat Bikkurim); alt., <b>חרוסת</b> (charoset), see GR"A</i> into which flour is mixed, behold, it is forbidden. Loaves [made from leavened] dough that became moldy or that dried out, behold, they are forbidden.
<i>Chamran</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">=<b>חמרן</b>, a type of chametz (see Minchat Bikkurim); alt., <b>חמץ</b> (chametz) (see GR"A)</i> that fell inside a [wine] cistern, behold it is considered to have been removed. Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda says, [a container of] roasted flour into which a drop [of water] fell (e.g., from the roof) -- it does not have the status of chametz. 
[Kernels of] wheat or barley that were soaked in water and became leavened -- behold, they are forbidden. Rabbi Yosei says, [kernels of] barley that were soaked in water and burst open, behold, they are forbidden; and [barley soaked] in vinegar, either way (i.e., whether they burst open or not), they are permitted because the vinegar contracts them (Pes. 40a:5).
One may not knead matzah using boiling water because it parboils,<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., causes the outer shell of the wheat kernel to leaven, see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim_2.7.4" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim_2.7.4">Y. Pes. II.7.4</a>, Guggenheimer)</i> nor using lukewarm water because it causes it to ferment, but one may knead it using cold water. One may not knead matzah using any other type of liquid, and if [one does begin to so] knead it, he may bake it immediately [without rendering it chametz], but Rabbi Meir forbids it. But one may spread any of these [liquids] on it<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., on the surface of the matzah dough, see Pes. 36a:9</i>.
Water that was used by bakers may be poured out in a level place, but it may not be poured out in a place with a downward slope (קטפרוס) because it gathers together and becomes leavened.
A woman who collects water that was used by a baker in order to knead [dough] with it for [use] after the Festival, behold, these (i.e., the goods for which she used the dough) are forbidden. Furthermore, women are accustomed to not kneading [dough] after the Festival with water that was heated during the Festival. § Rabbi Eliezer said to Rabbi Yehoshua,<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"> i.e., in regards to whether challah may be separated during Passover from dough that became impure, and then set aside until after Passover, even though it may ferment during Passover (see Pes. 3:3)</i> how can you possibly say that challah may be separated in a state of impurity during the Festival [and left to ferment], when it is written saying (Ex. 12:19), "leaven may not be found in your houses"? Rabbi Yehoshua said to him, behold,  [on the seventh day of Passover,] "only that which which may be eaten by every person [may be made by you]" (Ex. 12:16).  Rabbi Eliezer said to him, still, the matter hangs in the balance -- who can overbalance it? Rabbi Yehoshua said, I will overbalance it, for since what I perform through my own actions (lit., "with my hands")  can cause me to violate a negative prohibition, thus [with respect to] that which I leave alone in the state that I found it [without interfering], how can I violate a negative commandment if it was not through my actions?    
And the Sages say, three women are involved in the dough (i.e., the process of making matzah): One kneads it, one spreads it out, [and] one bakes it. When one [completes her] kneading, she spreads it out, and another kneads in her place. When one [completes] spreading out [the dough], she bakes it, and another one spreads out in her place. Since the three of them are involved in it and each one continues in turn<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">=<b>חוזרין חלילה</b> (see Pes. 48b:10, Steinsaltz tr.)</i>, the dough will not become leavened. <i>What is the measure of the dough?</i> <sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Note: Per Minchat Bikkurim, "the measure of the dough" refers to the maximum amount of dough that three women can work with at once without potentially rendering it chametz.</i> Rabbi Yishmael bar Rabbi Yochanan ben Berokah says, with respect to wheat, up to three <i>kavs</i>, and with respect to barley, up to four <i>kavs</i>. And as long as a woman is [actively] involved in the dough, it will not be susceptible to becoming chametz. Rabbi Natan says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, the matters are reversed.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, according to Rabbi Natan, the measure is actually three <i>kavs</i> for barley and four <i>kavs</i> for wheat.</i>
[If] the fourteenth [of Nissan] falls on the Sabbath, we remove everything [containing chametz] before the Sabbath begins, and bake matzah for it (i.e., for Passover) up until Sabbath Eve. Pure and impure Terumah: We remove them before Sabbath begins, the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, [they are removed] at their [customary] time. Pure and impure Terumah are removed on the Sabbath. Said Rabbi Elazer bar Rabbi Tzaddok, Terumah [is removed] before the Sabbath since few eat it, and <i>chullin</i> on the Sabbath since many eat it. Said Rabbi Elazer bar Rabbi Tzaddok, one time we were sitting before Rabban Gamaliel in the study hall in Lod [during a year when Passover fell on the Sabbath, see Pes. 49a:2] and in came Zunin, the deputy [of Rabban Gamaliel], and he said, "The time has come to remove the chametz!" My father and I want to the house of Rabban Gamaliel and we removed the chametz [even though it was the Sabbath].
[The Mishnah, Pes. 3:8, states that one who leaves Jerusalem and remembers that he is carrying consecrated meat burns it where he stands if he has passed Mount Scopus, but otherwise he must return to the Temple and burn it there.] <i>What is [Mount] Scopus?</i> [It is the place from where] one sees [all of Jerusalem] and there is nothing that obstructs [his view]. You say, one who is on his way to slaughter the Passover offering, or to circumcise his son, or to eat at a betrothal feast in his father-in-law's house, and he remembers that he has chametz inside his house, if he has enough time to return, he returns [to his house and removes the chametz], and if not, he does not return. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, [as to] any feast that is not in furtherance of a mitzvah, a <i>chaver</i> (see Dem. 2:3) is not permitted to eat from it.  If he passed [Mount] Scopus, he burns it (i.e., the consecrated meat) where he stands, and if not, he returns and burns it in front of the Temple with wood from the [Altar] pile. In other words, they only said that he need not return in order to make it easy on him. <i>How much [requires that] they return?</i> Ben Beteira says, at least the equivalent of two eggs'-bulk, but we did not find anyone who agreed with him (see Pes. 50a:2). [If] he wanted to burn it in front of the Temple with his own wood, or on his roof with wood from the [Altar] pile (see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.7.8.2" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.7.8.2">Y. Pes. VII.8.2</a>), we do not listen to him.
In a place where their custom is to return the betrothal money [if the betrothed man or woman died before the marriage was consummated], they return it. In a place where their custom is not to return the betrothal money, they do not return it. In a place where their custom is to stand up and sit down [for eulogies at a funeral], they stand up and sit down. In a place where their custom is to not do it, they do not do. [Even where the custom is to stand up and sit down for eulogies,] one does not stand up and sit down more than seven times. In a place where their custom is to greet mourners on the Sabbath, they greet them. In a place where their custom is not to greet, they do not greet. In a place where the custom is for the mourners to walk behind the dead [in a funeral procession], they walk [behind them]. In a place where the custom is to not walk, they do not walk. In a place where their custom is to light candles on Yom Kippur Eve, they light candles. In a place where their custom is not to light, they do not light. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, we light [candles] in inns and in mikvehs [on Yom Kippur Eve]. Those of whom it was said "they light," and those of whom it was said, "they do not light," they only said it in order [that people not become] accustomed to sin.
In a place where their custom [on the fourteenth of Nissan] is to do labor related to the earth (i.e., harvesting, etc.), they may do so until midday. In a place where their custom is not to do it, they do not do it.
From what point on the fourteenth [of Nissan] is labor forbidden? Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya'akov says, from the evening (אור) of the fourteenth. Rabbi Yehuda says, from the appearance of the sun. Said Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya'akov, where else do we find that labor is prohibited for only part of the day, and permitted for part of the day? Rabbi Yehuda said to him, it proves itself, since for part [of the day preceding Passover] chametz is forbidden, and for part of it, it is permitted.
And the Sages say, even in a place where they said that labor may not be performed from Passover Eve until midday [on the fourteenth of Nissan], three craftsmen may [nonetheless perform their] work: tailors, hairdressers, and launderers. The tailors, for [even] an ordinary person may sew in his customary way on the intermediate days of a Festival. The hairdressers, for a Nazirite and a <i>metzora</i> and someone who suffered a wound to the his head may cut their hair on the intermediate days of a Festival. The launderers, for someone coming from the seaside, or from other countries overseas may launder [their clothes] on the intermediate days of a Festival. Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda says, even shoemakers, for pilgrims [traveling by foot to Jerusalem] during the pilgrimage Festivals may repair their shoes and their sandals on the intermediate days of a Festival. Dung that is in the middle of [--?--<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Note: The Tosefta here is defective. Minchat Bikkurim supplies "מבוי", i.e., "an alleyway."</i>], they may may clear it to the sides. [Dung] that is in a barnyard or a courtyard -- they may take it out to the garbage heap.
Six things the people of Jericho did -- three according to the will of the Sages and three against the will of the Sages. They grafted palm trees on the entire day of Passover Eve (i.e., the fourteenth of Nissan), and they "bundled" the Shema, and they harvested [grain] before the Omer according to the will of the Sages. And these are [what they did] against the will of the Sages: They permitted [the people to make use of] small branches of [trees that had been] dedicated [to the Temple], they ate fallen fruit on the Sabbath, and they gave Peah (the corners of the field left aside for the poor) from vegetables. Said Rabbi Yehuda, if it was according to the will of the Sages, then everyone would act in this way. [Rather, it should be said that] as to three, the Sages reprimanded them, and as to the other three, the Sages did not reprimand them. And these [are the three things as to which the Sages] reprimanded them: They grafted palm trees on the entire day of Passover Eve, and they "bundled" the Shema, and they harvested and piled [grain] before the Omer, and they did not reprimand them. These are what [the Sages] reprimanded them for: They permitted [the use of] small branches of dedicated [trees], and they ate fallen fruit on the Sabbath, and they gave Peah from vegetables.
<i>How did they "bundle" the Shema?</i> They said "Shema Yisrael [etc.]" without pausing [between the words]. Rabbi Yehuda says, they paused, but they would not say, "Baruch shem kavod, etc."
<i>How did they give Peah from vegetables?</i> They would not give Peah [from vegetables] except from turnips and leeks, because they are all harvested at the same time (see Peah 1:4). Rabbi Yosei says, even cabbage. Said Rabbi Yosei, it once happened with the son of Nebo that his father gave [the poor] Peah from turnips, and he went and found the poor people at the entrance of his garden [with turnips in their hands]. His son said to them, "You are not concerned with the words of the Sages. Throw down what is in your hands." They threw it down. And he [was someone who] gave double in tithes, and [thus] it was not that he was stingy with poor people, but that he concerned himself with the words of the Sages.
<i>How did they eat fallen fruit on the Sabbath?</i> They would open up their roofs and their orchards to poor people during years of drought, and the poor people of Israel would come and eat permitted fallen dates<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Per Minchat Bikkurim, "permitted" here refers to leftover dates as to which there was a doubt as to their ripeness (which thus would be "permitted" to eat without tithing).</i> on the Sabbath. <i>How did they permit [people to use] small branches from dedicated [trees]?</i> The Sages said to them, do you not concede to us that aftergrowths of [trees that were] dedicated [to the Temple] are forbidden? They said to them, at the time that our forefathers dedicated them, they only dedicated the hearts [of the trees] themselves, because the strong men [from the Temple] would come and carry those away with force.

Chapter 4

One who brings a guilt offering [for theft] but does not bring what he stole -- the blood [of the offering] may not be stirred until he brings that which he stole; however, the form [of the offering] is allowed to decay (תעובר צורתו, see Pes. 7:9, Steinsaltz tr.), and it is taken out to the [designated] place of burning. One who brings a guilt-offering and does not bring the payment for his misuse -- the blood may not be stirred until he brings the payment for misuse; however, the form is allowed to decay, and it is taken out to the place of burning. A <i>metzora</i> that brought a sin-offering before a guilt offering -- one may not stir the blood until he brings the guilt-offering; rather, its form is allowed to decay, and it is taken out to the place of burning.
All sacrificial animals that are sacrificed before the morning Tamid or that are delayed after the afternoon Tamid -- behold, they are disqualified, as only the incense may be [offered up] before the morning Tamid, and only the incense may be delayed until after the afternoon Tamid and the Passover offering on Passover Eve and [the offerings brought by] those lacking atonement, in order that [with respect the Passover offering], they may partake of the Paschal lamb in the evening (see Deut. 16:6). Rabbi Yishmael bar Rabbi Yochanan ben Berokah says, those who lack atonement bring their sacrifices along with the afternoon Tamid, in order that they may partake of consecrated [foods] in the evening.
One who slaughtered [the Passover offering] for its purpose but  completed [the rituals associated with the sacrifice] for a different purpose -- it is valid because [a sacrifice] is rendered valid through the slaughter. <i>How is it "slaughtered for those who cannot eat it" (Pes. 5:3)?</i> [This applies where] he slaughtered for a sick person or for an elderly person who cannot eat an olive's-bulk. <i>How is it [slaughtered] for "those who are not registered" (ibid.)?</i> [This applies where] he slaughtered it for members of a different collective. [If] he slaughtered for [both] circumcised and uncircumcised, or for [both] impure persons and for pure persons, it is valid. Abba Shaul disqualifies it, and it is logical that it should be disqualified, since [a person's unfit status] at the time [of the sacrifice] disqualifies [a sacrifice], and an uncircumcised person is disqualified *and an impure person is disqualified (following the GR"A). Just as "the time" (i.e., where the butcher both intends that sacrifice be eaten in its proper time and not at its proper time, see Minchat Bikkurim) makes it [disqualified under the principle of] "the part is like the whole," so too an uncircumcised person makes it [disqualified under] "the part is like the whole." Or perhaps look at it this way: Since an impure person and an uncircumcised person are disqualified, just as [partial] impurity does not cause [application of the principle] "the part is like the whole," thus so too a [partially] uncircumcised person does not cause [application of the principle] "the part is like the whole." Let us see to what case it is similar: We derive a matter that does not apply to every offering (i.e., lack of circumcision), from a [different] matter that does not apply to every offering (i.e., impurity), and it is proven from "time," which [also] does not apply to all offerings. Or perhaps look at it this way: We derive a matter which does not permit exception to a general prohibition, from a [different] matter which does not permit an exception to a general prohibition, and it is not proven from impurity, which does permit an exception to a general prohibition.
One who slaughters the Passover offering along with chametz on the fourteenth [of Nissan] transgresses a negative commandment, [but the] Passover offering itself is valid, and he fulfills his obligation through it with [respect to] the Passover offering. And whether he is the one who slaughters it, or the one who sprinkles its blood, or the one who offers it up [on the Altar, he is liable]. <i>In what case does this apply?</i> When one of the members of a collective [who will partake in the Paschal lamb] has chametz [in his possession]. If none of the members of the collective has chametz, he is exempt, but the one who pinches the neck of a bird inside [the Temple] with chametz on the fourteenth transgresses a negative commandment.
Rabbi Shimon says, [if] the Passover offering [is offered] on the fourteenth [along with chametz (see Minchat Yitzchak)] for its purpose, he is liable because [the offering] is valid [to be sacrificed on Passover], and [if] not for its purpose, he is exempt because it is disqualified. And [a Passover offering] on the intermediate days of the Festival -- for its purpose, he is exempt, because it is disqualified, but for a different purpose, he is liable, because it is valid. <i>When does this apply?</i> When they are fit to be brought as a Passover offering, but if they are not fit to be brought as a Passover offering, whether [it is sacrificed] for its purpose or not for its purpose, he is liable, because it is valid. Said Rabbi Shimon, a Passover offering on the fourteenth in its purpose is valid, and not for its purpose is disqualified. On the intermediate days of the Festival -- for its purpose, it is disqualified, and not for its purpose, it is valid. <i>And when [else] does this apply?</i> When it is fit to bring as a Passover offering, but if it is not fit to bring as a Passover offering, whether for its purpose or not for its purpose, it is valid.
[If] he slaughtered another [offering] for the purpose [of being a Passover offering] on the fourteenth [of Nissan], Rabbi Eliezer disqualifies it and Rabbi Yehoshua deems it fit. Said Rabbi Yehoshua, "Just as on the other days of the year in which [the Passover offering] is not fit for its own purpose but is fit for another purpose, then on the fourteenth, in which it is fit for its own purpose, is not logical that it would also be fit for other offerings to be offered for its purpose?" Rabbi Eliezer said to him, "Or reverse the matter ("או חלוף הדברים", see GR"A). If you hold that on the other days of the year in which it is not fit [to be sacrificed] for its own purpose [but] it is fit for another purpose, [then] on the fourteenth in which it is fit for its purpose, is it not logical that it would be fit not only for its own purpose but also for another purpose? And you must hold this way, because [according to your logic] if other sacrifices are rendered fit [when offered] for their own purpose on the other days of the year, so too [the Passover offering] would be fit to be offered for other purposes and other offerings would be fit to be offered for its purpose on the fourteenth -- but it is not fit to be offered for other purposes [on the fourteenth]." Rabbi Yehoshua said to him, "You have weakened the power of the Passover offering and you have [simultaneously] given power to peace offerings." Rabbi Eliezer returned and advanced a different argument: "We find that [an animal] consecrated as a Passover offering [but not brought on Passover] may be brought as a peace offering, but [an animal originally] consecrated as a peace offering may not be brought as a Passover offering. And given that a Passover offering  from among those that were consecrated [but left over] may be brought as a peace offering [after Passover],  but is not valid [to be offered] for the purpose of a peace offering [during Passover itself], [therefore, as to funds left over from the purchase] peace offering, which may not be consecrated to [purchase an animal to] be brought as a Passover offering [during the rest of the year], does it not follow that it should be disqualified [if it is brought] for the purpose of a Passover offering [on Passover itself]?" Rabbi Yehoshua said to him, "A sin offering will prove the matter. For [leftover funds from its purchase] may not be consecrated to be brought as a peace offering, and [yet] it is valid [if brought] for the purpose of a peace offering, [and therefore] even you should not wonder that a peace offering, which although [its leftover funds] may not be consecrated to be brought as a Passover offering, is [nonetheless] valid to be brought for the purpose of a Passover offering." Rabbi Eliezer said to him, "No. If you said that regarding a sin offering that is indeed valid [to be brought] for its own purpose on the remaining days of the year, you must [also] say that as to a Passover offering that is not valid [to be brought] for its purpose on the remaining days of the year, since it is not valid for its purpose on the other days of the year, if other [sacrifices] are slaughtered for its purpose on the fourteenth, behold, it is disqualified."
One who slaughters the Passover offering to eat it on the fourteenth [of Nissan], it is valid to eat it. [If he prepared it] half-cooked, boiled, or cooked, it is valid. One who slaughters the Passover offering on behalf of the members of a company, and he said that he did not slaughter it in its name (i.e., he slaughtered it with a different purpose in mind), he is not believed. Rabbi Yehuda says, [if he said it] before he began [the slaughter] he is believed, [but if he said it] after he began [the slaughter] he is not believed.
A Passover offering that was slaughtered in the morning of the fourteenth [of Nissan] that was not [slaughtered] by its name (i.e., it was designated for a different purpose, see Pes. 6:5), Rabbi Yehoshua deems it fit as though it was slaughtered on the thirteenth. Ben Beteira deems it disqualified as though it was slaughtered in the evening. Said Rabbi Yehoshua, "Since on the thirteenth it is not fit [to be a Pesach offering], and on the morning of the fourteenth it is not fit, would you not say that [if it was slaughtered] on the thirteenth for a different purpose it should be deemed valid? [Thus,] even on the morning of the fourteenth, if he slaughtered it for a different purpose, it it valid." [However,] he then reconsidered and instead supported the words of Ben Beteira [which were as follows]: "No. If you hold that on the thirteenth that it is not even somewhat fit [to be designated as a Passover offering], you must say that on the morning of the fourteenth, when it is at least somewhat fit [to be so designated], since it is at least somewhat fit, if it was slaughtered on the morning of the fourteenth for a different purpose, it is disqualified."
The first Passover was [divided] among three groups<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">=<b>כתות</b> not <b>בתים</b> ("houses") (see GR"A and Pes. 5:7)</i> and the second Passover was not [divided] among three groups. A Tamid sacrifice would be slaughtered in the evening, he (i.e., the Kohen) would burn the incense, and he would tend to the candles [of the menorah]. He would come to where the Passover offering was located, and he would cut it open and take out its sacrificial portions, even four or five [offerings at a time]. He would put them on a tray and burn them on top of the Altar. And on the Sabbath he would keep the carcass "dressed" (i.e., not flayed) and leave it and go out. Rabbi Yishmael bar Rabbi Yochanan ben Berokah says, [if] the fourteenth [of Nissan] fell on the Sabbath, he would not flay [the carcass] except until the place of the waving (i.e., the breast and thigh, see Men. 62a:1). [If] the Kohen who was to offer [the sacrifice] on the Altar would pour out [the blood] in a single pouring against the base [of the Altar], it would be disqualified. The Levites would stand on their platform and finished the Hallel in song. If they finished it, they would repeat it, and if they repeated it, they would repeat it a third time, although [in actuality] they never repeated it a third time in all their days. Said Rabbi Yehuda -- "in all their days" -- [indeed,] the third [and last] group never reached to "I love the Lord, for He hears" (Ps. 116:1), because the people were few and they would call it the "lazy group."
As they did things on weekdays, so they also did things on the Sabbath, except that the Kohanim would mop up [the blood from] the Temple Courtyard, which was against the will of the Sages. <i>How did [the Kohanim] mop the Temple Courtyard?</i> They would seal it up  and let a stream of water flow over it until it was made clean like [the color of] milk. Rabbi Yehuda says, a cup was filled with the blood of the various species [of sacrificed animals], and they sprinkled one sprinkle on top of the Altar, for [they reasoned that] if one of their blood was mixed in with it, it would render [the Altar] fit. [When the Sages saw one of the Kohanim doing this,] They said to him, "Is it not the case that [this blood] was not collected inside a vessel, and is it not the case that blood that is not collected inside a vessel is disqualified from [sprinkling] on top of the Altar? And another thing, that this is secondary blood [which comes out only after the animal is dead], and secondary blood is disqualified from [sprinkling] on top of the Altar." He said to them, "In that case, why do they seal off the Temple Courtyard and [why do] the Kohanim let the blood flow up to their knees?" They said to him, "Blessed are the Kohanim who let the blood flow up to their knees." § [Returning to the prior discussion, ] Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya'akov says, [with respect to the groupings of those bringing their Passover offerings to the Temple for slaughter (Pes. 5:9-5:10),] the third group went and sat in the Women's Courtyard.
One time the fourteenth [of Nissan] fell on the Sabbath and [the people] asked Hillel the Elder, does the Passover offering override the Sabbath? He said to them, "Do we only have one Passover offering a year that overrides the Sabbath? [Rather,] we have more than three hundred 'Passover offerings' (i.e., the various sacrifices that are brought throughout the year) that override the Sabbath." The entire Temple Courtyard crowded around him. He said to them, "Just as the Tamid is a communal sacrifice that overrides the Sabbath, so too the Passover offering is a communal sacrifice that overrides the Sabbath. And another thing, it is said regarding the Tamid (Num. 28:2), 'its appointed time' and it is [also] said regarding Passover offering (Num. 9:2) 'its appointed time'; thus just as the Tamid as to which it is said 'its appointed time' overrides the Sabbath, so too the Passover offering as to which it is [also] said 'its appointed time' must also override the Sabbath. And moreover, [the matter may be further proven by] a <i>kol v'chomer</i> (a logical deduction): If the Tamid, which does not render one liable for excommunication [by failing to perform it] overrides the Sabbath, is it not logical that the Passover offering, which <i>does</i> render one liable for excommunication [by failing to perform it] must also override the Sabbath? And moreover, I received this tradition from my teachers that Passover overrides the Sabbath, and not [just] the first Passover but [also] the second Passover, and not [just] a Passover offering brought by the community, but also a Passover offering brought by an individual." They said to him, "What should be done about the people that did not bring knives or Passover offerings to consecrate [because they did not know that the Passover offering overrides the Sabbath]?" He said to them, "Leave it to them, [since] the Holy Spirit is upon them. If they are not prophets, they are the children of prophets." What the Israelites did at that moment was that whoever brought a lamb for his Passover offering lodged [his knife] in its wool, [and whoever brought a] kid goat, he tied [his knife] between its horns, and thus they brought knives and Passover offerings to consecrate, and they slaughtered their Passover offerings. And on that day, they appointed Hillel as the Nasi and he taught them all the laws of Passover.
One time King [Herod] Agrippa sought to find out how many were the multitudes [of Israelites], and he said to the Kohanim, separate for me a kidney from each and every Passover offering, and they separated for him six hundred thousand pairs of kidneys, double the number of the exodus from Egypt, and there was not any Passover offering that did not have at least ten registrants, not including those who [could not attend because they] were impure or that had too long of a distance to travel. On that day, they entered the Temple Mount and it could not hold all of them, and they called it the "Passover of the crushed."   

Chapter 5

Rabbi Eliezer says, just as the slaughter [of the Paschal lamb] overrides the Sabbath, so too those acts that facilitate the slaughter will override the Sabbath. Rabbi Akiva stated a general rule: Any form of labor that could have been performed from [before] Sabbath Eve does not override the Sabbath, and that which could not have been performed from [before] Sabbath Eve does override the Sabbath. Rabbi Eliezer said to him, community sacrifices will prove it, for they are valid after the conclusion of the Sabbath, but they override the Sabbath -- what is the difference between acts that facilitate the slaughter [that are performed] after the slaughter (e.g., burning the fats) and acts that facilitate the slaughter [that are performed] before the slaughter (e.g., bringing a knife). Said Rabbi Akiva, concerning acts that facilitate the slaughter [performed] <i>after</i> the slaughter has [already] overridden the Sabbath, which also override the Sabbath, does [it follow that] acts that facilitate the slaughter [performed] <i>before</i> the slaughter [also] override the Sabbath, when the slaughter itself has not yet pushed away the Sabbath?  And furthermore, lest something happen to disqualify it (i.e., the slaughter) and it turns out that he has desecrated the Sabbath and not [even] performed [the act of slaughter].  
The Passover [offering] comes from the flocks [of sheep or goats], and does not come from the cattle. It comes from the sheep or from the goats. It comes from the males but it does not come from the females. It comes from a one-year-old [lamb or kid] and does not come from a two-year-old. And it can only be eaten at night, and it can only be eaten until midnight, and it can only be eaten by its registrants, and it can only be eaten roasted (see Zev. 5:8). And one may be held liable for it on account of breaking a bone (Ex. 12:46). 
The Festival offering (chagigah) that is brought with it (i.e., along with the Passover offering) comes from the flocks or from the cattle, and from the sheep or from the goats, from the males or from the females, and it comes from a one-year-old [or from] a two-year-old<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">lit., "a daughter of one year, a daughter of two years"</i>. And it is eaten for two days and one night. And one is not held liable for it on account of breaking a bone. The Festival offering that comes with it -- she is eaten first in order that the Paschal lamb is eaten upon being satiated. The Festival offering that comes with it fulfills his obligation to be joyous [on a Festival], but does not fulfill his obligation to bring a Festival offering. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, the Festival offering that is brought up together with [the Passover offering] on the table, and dishes that are brought up with it on the table, behold, they must be eliminated with it.
[If] the fourteenth [of Nissan] falls on the Sabbath, whether they are offerings (lit., "things") that are fit to be brought on Passover, or whether they are offerings that are not fit to be brought on Passover, and it is slaughtered for the sake of Passover, or one slaughters it in the name of a communal sin-offering, in the name of a burnt offering, or a Passover offering that was slaughtered on the Sabbath for another purpose -- he is exempt, the words of Rabbi Meir. Said Rabbi Shimon, Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua did not disagree about offerings that are not fit to be brought on Passover and are slaughtered in the name of Passover, or [where] one slaughters in the name of a communal sin offering, in the name of a communal burnt offering, that he is liable. About what did they disagree? About offerings that are fit to be brought on Passover and he slaughtered them in the name of Passover [but which were originally designated for a different purpose (see Pes. 6:5)] -- that Rabbi Eliezer holds him liable to bring a sin offering, and Rabbi Yehoshua deems him exempt.
One who slaughters the Tamid (the daily offering) on the Sabbath for another purpose is liable. Said Rabbi Yosei, I heard that [regarding] the one who slaughters the Tamid on the Sabbath that is not properly inspected, that he is liable for a sin offering, and he goes back and brings a different Tamid to render it fit, apart from the one that was [originally] slaughtered, as it is said (Num. 28:31), "Unblemished they shall be to you, and their libation-offerings." When they are inspected, they are [fit to be] Tamid offerings, [and] when they are not inspected, they are not [fit to be] Tamid offerings. 
[If] he slaughtered it and found out that its owners had "withdrawn their hands" from it (i.e., they registered for another Paschal lamb), or that they had died, or that they had become impure, behold, he is liable (contra Pes. 6:6). Rabbi Yishmael bar Rabbi Yochanan ben Beroka says, if he had [enough] time in order to find out, behold, he is liable, and if not, behold, he is exempt. A communal sin offering that was slaughtered on the Sabbath not in their name -- behold, he is liable, and its fats are burned in the evening.  
An individual sin offering and an individual burnt offering that he slaughtered on the Sabbath in their name, and he sprinkled their blood not in their name -- he is liable. [If] the owners wanted him to slaughter two communal sin offerings but only one was needed, he is liable on the last one. [If the owners wanted him to slaughter] two communal burnt offerings but only one was needed, he is liable on the last one. 
[Regarding the prohibition against roasting the Paschal lamb on a metal spit (Pes. 7:2),] Rabbi Yehuda says, just as [the part of] a wood [spit that is inside the Passover offering] does not burn, so too [the part of] a metal [spit that is inside the Passover offering] does not get hot. They said to him, the wood [spit] and the metal [spit] are not alike, [for if only] part of the metal [spit] gets hot, the whole thing gets hot, [but] as to wood, even though part of it gets hot, the whole thing does not get hot.   
A Passover offering onto which they poured wine or oil -- even though it drips from top to bottom, it is not [considered] cooked whatsoever. [If] he boiled it and afterwards roasted it, [or] roasted it and afterwards boiled it, behold, that is forbidden (see Ex. 12:9).  They may not scald its head or its legs, or smear it with clay or earth [to remove its hair], but they may singe it with fire.
The Passover offering is roasted whole [over a fire] and is not roasted in pieces. [Alternatively, if] he wants, he can cut it into pieces and place it limb by limb [directly] on top of the coals. Two Passover offerings may not be roasted in a single oven because they may get mixed up, even if this one is a goat and that one is a sheep, because [the people] will become accustomed [and subsequently do so even with two offerings of the same species], but they may roast four or five Passover offerings in four or five ovens -- this one in that one -- and they need not be concerned. Five groups [of registrants] that mixed up their Passover offerings -- one member out of the group is believed to say, "This Passover offering is the Passover offering belonging to that group." It can only be eaten at night, and it can only be eaten until midnight, and they are not liable for it on account of it being <i>notar</i> (left over beyond the allotted time), and no [improper] thought disqualifies it on account of <i>piggul</i> until dawn.

Chapter 6

[The Mishnah, Pes. 7:4, states that the Passover offering may be brought in a state of impurity and eaten in a state of impurity.] <i>At what time did they say that the Passover offering may be eaten in a state of impurity?</i> At any time that it started out by being brought in a state of impurity. [If] it was slaughtered in a state of purity and [then the owner] was rendered impure by the community, he [should] sprinkle the blood in a state of impurity (but see GR"A and Pes. 78b:20, "in a state of purity") and not eat the meat in a state of impurity. [If] he slaughtered in a state of purity and the blood became impure, he [should] sprinkle the blood in a state of impurity and not eat the meat in a state of impurity.
[If] the community and the Kohanim are pure and the service vessels are impure, they perform it (i.e., the slaughter of the Passover offering) in a state of impurity. <i>At what time may the Passover offering be brought in a state of impurity?</i> At any time that the majority of the community is impure. [If] half was pure and half was impure, the pure [half] observe Pesach Rishon and the impure [half] observe Pesach Sheni. [However,] an individual may tip the balance (i.e., he may intentionally make himself impure, thereby creating an impure majority (Pes. 80a:4)), in order [for the entire community] to observe [the first] Passover in a state of impurity, the words of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Eliezer ben Metatyah says, an individual may not [intentionally] tip the balance in order [for the entire community] to observe [the first] Passover in a state of impurity, as it says (Deut. 17:5), "You may not slaughter the the Passover offering in <i>one</i> of your settlements" (see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim_8.7.2" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.8.7.2">Y. Pes. VIII.7.2</a>). Rabbi Shimon says, [if there are] half pure and half impure, the pure perform [the Passover offering] amongst themselves, and the impure perform amongst themselves. They said to him, they may not divide the community; rather, either everyone performs it in a state of purity, or everyone performs it a state of impurity.  
Rabbi Yehoshua says, every sacrifice that is [mentioned] in the Torah as to which an olive's-bulk of flesh or an olive's-bulk of fat is left over, he sprinkles the blood on its behalf. [If] half an olive's-bulk of flesh or half an olive's-bulk of fat [is left over], he does not sprinkle the blood on its behalf. With a burnt offering, even if but half an olive's-bulk of flesh or half an olive's-bulk of fat was left over, he sprinkles the blood on its behalf because the whole [animal] is fit go up in smoke. And with a grain-offering, even if the entire grain-offering remains, but an olive's-bulk of flesh or an olive's-bulk of fat is not left over from the [accompanying] sacrifice, he does not sprinkle the blood on its behalf. And with a Passover offering, if there [remains] an olive's-bulk for each and every person [in the syndicate], he sprinkles, and if not, he does not sprinkle.
Rabbi Yehoshua says, every sacrifice that is [mentioned] in the Torah as to which the flesh became impure and the fats remain [pure], he sprinkles the blood on behalf of the fats. [If] the fats became impure and the meat remains [pure], he sprinkles the blood on behalf of the flesh. But not so with the Passover offering: Even though the flesh became impure and the fats remain [pure], he does not sprinkle the blood on behalf of the fats, since it was only brought from the start to be eaten. [If] the fats became impure and the flesh remains [pure] -- if there is an olive's-bulk for each and every person [in the syndicate], he sprinkles, and if not, he does not sprinkle.   
Every public and individual sacrifice -- the tzitz (i.e., the frontplate of the Kohen Gadol) effects appeasement on the impurity of blood and on the impurity of the body, except for that of a nazir and one who performs the [slaughter of the] Passover offering, for [as to these] the tzitz appease the impurity of blood and does not appease the impurity of the body, and if one is rendered impure by the impurity of the deep (i.e., of a concealed grave), behold, it appeases.  <i>How so?</i> If he was going to slaughter the Passover offering and they said to him, "A dead person was with you in a house that you entered," or "[A dead person was] under a stone that you sat upon," and it became known to him either after he performed the [slaughter of the] Passover offering or before he performed the [slaughter of the] Passover offering, he needs to observe Pesach Sheni. But if they said to him, "A grave of the deep was with you in a house that you entered," or "under a stone that you sat upon," and it became known to him before he performed the [slaughter of the] Passover offering, he needs to observe Pesach Sheni (however, unlike in the first case, he is not disqualified if he is informed <i>after</i> the slaughter).
[If] he slaughtered it before it became known to him that the owners had withdrawn their hands from it, or they had died, or they became impure, it is burned immediately. Rabbi Yishmael bar Rabbi Yochanan ben Berokah says, if there is enough time for him to have been made aware, he burns it immediately, and if not, its form is allowed to decay and it is removed to the house of burning. This is the general rule: If disqualification befell it [due to impurity] of the body, it is burned immediately. [If due to impurity] of the blood or impurity of its owners, its form is allowed to decay and it is removed to the house of burning.
One who burns the bones or cuts into the sinews or the horns or the hooves [of the Passover offering] has not violated a negative commandment. The raw bones and sinews -- behold, they are like the flesh in every respect. One who breaks a bone of a pure Passover offering -- behold, he receives forty lashes, but the Passover offering itself remains valid, and one fulfills his obligation of the Paschal lamb through it. A valid Passover offering -- he is liable on its account under the laws [prohibiting the] breaking of a bone (Ex. 12:46). A disqualified Passover offering -- he is not liable on its account under [the laws prohibiting the] breaking of a bone. Rabbi Ya'akov says, [if the Passover offering] was once valid and it became disqualified, he is liable on its account under "breaking of a bone." [If] it did not have a period of validity before it became disqualified, he is not liable on its account under "breaking of a bone." Rabbi Shimon says, even if it was once valid and it became disqualified, he is not liable on its account under "breaking of a bone." Rabbi Yishmael bar Rabbi Yochanan ben Berokah says, even if only one of its limbs became disqualified [and the rest remained valid], he is not liable on its account under "breaking of a bone."
One who breaks the bone [of the Paschal lamb] in order to eat an olive's-bulk of marrow -- [if it was from] the marrow that is in the head (i.e., the brain), or that is in the thigh-bone, he does not violate a negative commandment, and the marrow itself is valid, and he may fulfill the obligation [of partaking of the Passover offering] through it, and he may be liable through it under [the laws of] piggul and notar, and under [the laws of] impurity, and the impurity of carrying, and a lentil's-bulk [of its carcass renders him impure] through touching. The general rule of the matter of the marrow: Behold, it is like flesh in every respect. [If] he ate an olive's bulk of it raw or boiled -- before it gets dark [on Passover Eve], behold he is exempt, [and] from the time it gets dark, behold, he is liable. [If he ate] an olive's bulk of it roasted -- before it gets dark, he has not exempted himself from the syndicate, [and] from the time it gets dark, behold, he has exempted himself from the syndicate<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alternatively, "he has <i>disqualified</i> himself, etc." (see Pes. 41b:7)</i>.
One who takes an olive's-bulk of meat [of the Paschal lamb] out of a house [and brings it] to [another] house, or from syndicate to syndicate at the time of eating -- behold, he is liable, as it is said (Ex. 12:46): "Do not remove from the house any of the meat, outside [etc.]." Even though it is said "In one house [it is to be eaten]" (ibid.), they may eat it in their courtyards or on their roofs. <i>What is meant by "in one house"?</i> He should eat with one group. Rabbi Shimon says, behold, if they were sitting and eating and they saw a snake or a scorpion, behold, they may remove (lit., "uproot") their Paschal lamb and eat it in a different place, as it is said (Ex. 12:7), "on the houses in which they eat it." Thus, why does it say, "in one house it is to be eaten"? So that there will not be two syndicates eating, this one facing that one. § [In a situation where two syndicates are eating in one location (Pes. 7:13)], when the attendant stands up to mix [the wine], he must shut his mouth and turn his face, and chew until he reaches his own group and [then] swallow, so that he will not appear to be partaking of two Paschal lambs. [But] if there is only one syndicate in that place, he may eat along with the whole house and need not be concerned.

Chapter 7

[If] the fourteenth [of Nissan] falls on Sabbath Eve, the Paschal lamb may be lowered into the oven at nightfall, and they cover it with shingles, and they place them on it from Sabbath Eve [onward]. They may place [shingles] on top of it, and they may cover it, and they may lift it out [of the oven] on the Sabbath, as long as they do not put it back, and if they put it back, behold, they are liable because it will come to be smeared around, and one who smears [something] around on the Sabbath, behold, he is liable for a sin offering. [If] visitors arrived and it was still in the oven -- if it is roasted, they may remove it, and if not, they may wait for it until it is roasted. [If] the outer [meat] was roasted but the inner [meat] was not roasted, one may carve off and eat [the roasted portion] until he arrives at the raw [meat].
They bring back the Passover offering whole and do not bring it back in pieces, the words of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says, on the Sabbath, either this way or that way is forbidden. On Yom Tov, either this way or that way is permitted. Said Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree on whether the Passover offering is brought back whole and not brought back in pieces. On what did they disagree? On the limbs -- that Beit Shammai say, they are brought back, and Beit Hillel say, they are not brought back.
An orphan on whose behalf his they slaughtered [the Passover offering] -- his guardian may eat from any place that he desires. [If] he was registered for one [Passover offering], he eats from the place that he is registered. [If] he is registered for two Passover offerings, he eats from whichever of them was slaughtered first. Rabbi Shimon says, in any case, they are registered for the Passover offering until it is slaughtered, and they may withdraw their hands from it until its blood is cast [on the Altar].
A person should not slaughter on behalf of his grown-up son or daughter, or on behalf of his male or female Hebrew slave, or on behalf of his wife; rather, [he may do so] with their knowledge. But he may slaughter on behalf of his minor son or daughter, and on behalf of his male or female Canaanite slave, whether with their knowledge or without their knowledge. And all who slaughter for themselves or whose master slaughtered on their behalf, eat from their own, except for a slave, who eats from that of his master. A Hebrew slave, and whoever is half slave and half free, eat from their own. A slave belonging to two partners eats from that of both of them. [If] he was registered for [only] one of them, he eats in the place that he is registered. [If] he was registered for two Passover offerings, he eats from whichever of them was slaughtered first, or if both of them were slaughtered at the same time, he eats from that of his master. [If] his master forgot what he told him (see Pes. 8:2), they both go out to the place of burning, and they need to observe Pesach Sheni. Rabbi Natan says, they do not need to observe Pesach Sheni, for they already cast the blood upon them.
The members of a syndicate who were registered for a Passover offering -- if there is an olive's-bulk for each and every one of them, they eat from it, and if not, they may not eat from it. [If] they registered for it one after another (i.e., not simultaneously), they first [registrants] among them who have [an olive's-bulk] eat, and the last of them do not eat, and they need to observe Pesach Sheni, the words of Rebbi. Rabbi Natan says, they do not need to observe Pesach Sheni, for they already cast the blood upon them. The members of a syndicate that desired to register others for their Passover offering, they have the right to do it. [If] they wanted to withdraw and [then] register others for their Passover offering, they have the right to do it. [If] they wanted to withdraw and register others for their portion, they have the right to do it. In all cases, they may withdraw and depart, as long as their remains one member from the original syndicate, the words of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says, whether from the original syndicate, or from the last syndicate, as long as they do not leave the Passover offering as it is (i.e., it must be eaten by someone). Members of a syndicate who wanted to register others for their portion, they have the right to do it. They money [that they paid] is chullin. [If] they wanted to withdraw to register others for their portion, they have the right to do. The money [that they paid] is chullin.  
One who registers others for his portion, he has the right to do it. The money [that he paid] is chullin. [If] he wanted to withdraw to register others for his portion, he has the right to do it. The money is chullin. One who registers others on his Festival offering (chagigah), the money is chullin. [If] he wanted to withdraw and register others for his Festival offering, the money is chullin.  
One who sells his burnt offering or his peace offering -- he has done nothing (i.e., the sale is not consummated). The money [that was paid is considered] stolen from the hands of the owners,<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., <b>וּמָעוֹת כׇּל שֶׁהֵן יִפְּלוּ לִנְדָבָה</b>, "The money goes toward freewill offerings" (GR"A, Pes. 89b:14)</i> and needless to say, [the same is true] with respect to a sin offering or a guilt offering. [If] some members of a syndicate died, or [if] some of them became impure, the remaining [members] eat [from the Passover offering] and need not be concerned. [If] there was a syndicate where one of its members had "loose hands" (i.e., he was a glutton), they have the right to tell him, "Take your portion with you [and go]," and not [only] because it is a Passover offering, rather, even a group that made a potluck<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>סִבּוּל</b> not <b>חבול</b>, per MS and see Pes. 89b:7)</i>, and there was one among them with "loose hands," they have the right to say to him, "Take your portion with you [and go]." [If] they wanted to do him a favor, he can come and eat from. [If] among them was a leper who was locked inside [his house to quarantine], they slaughter on his behalf on the seventh day (i.e., after his quarantine is complete, see Lev. 13:4), [and if it was a leper upon whom]  a judgment [of uncleanliness] has been decreed (see Lev. 13:8), they slaughter for him on the eighth day. A mother who has recently given birth -- they slaughter on her behalf on the fortieth day for a son, and on the eightieth day for a daughter, and anyone who became impure, whether before the sprinkling of the blood or whether after the sprinkling of the blood, behold, they are like one who removes a pile of stones [which may be covering a corpse (see Pes. 8:6)], and they need to observe Pesach Sheni. Rabbi Yishmael bar Rabbi Yochanan ben Berokah says, sometimes they are like one who removes a pile of stones, and sometimes they are not like like one who removes a pile of stones, and similar cases. <i>How so?</i> If there was a long pile [of stones], [and] he checked on one side, and [then] found an impurity (i.e., signs of a corpse) on the second side, behold these and all similar cases need to observe Pesach Sheni<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "are exempt from Pesach Sheni," see Nusachot K'tav Yad</i>, and all who become impure before the sprinkling of the blood, behold, these and all similar cases need to observe Pesach Sheni.
One who was impure at the time of slaughter and pure at the time of sprinkling, [or] pure at the time of slaughter and impure at the time of sprinkling, behold, that one may not partake [of the Passover offering] and needs to observe Pesach Sheni. One who is infirm at the time of slaughter and unable to eat an olive's bulk, [but] well at the time of sprinkling and able to eat an olive's bulk, [or] well at the time of slaughter and able to eat an olive's bulk, [but] infirm at the time of sprinkling and unable to eat an olive's bulk, behold, that one may not partake [of the Passover offering] and needs to observe Pesach Sheni.  In any event, he does not fulfill his obligation until he is well at the time of slaughter and at the time of sprinkling, and everyone as to whom there is a doubt, the blood is sprinkled on their account. [If] there is a doubt whether there is an olive's-bulk [of meat in the Passover offering] for each and every [member of the syndicate], [or] a doubt whether there is not [an olive's bulk], a doubt as to whether they are impure or a doubt as to whether they are pure, they are exempt from observing Pesach Sheni. Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda says, [regarding a woman] who observes "day for a day" (Pes. 8:5, Kulp tr.), for whom blood has been sprinkled, and afterwards she saw [an abnormal discharge], behold, this one does not partake, and she is exempt from observing Pesach Sheni, as she already fulfilled [her obligation] with the sprinkling [of blood], but one who is uncircumcised as to whom blood was sprinkled on his behalf, and afterwards he was circumcised, behold this one does not partake, and he is liable to observe Pesach Sheni.  
Said Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree regarding an uncircumcised non-Kohen, that he may receive a sprinkling [of the waters of purification from the Red Heifer] and partake [of the Passover offering]. <i>About what point did they disagree?</i> About an uncircumcised Gentile -- that Beit Shammai say, he immerses himself and [then] he may partake of his [portion of the] Passover offering in the evening, and Beit Hillel say, one who separates himself from [his] foreskin like one who separates himself from the grave [and is impure for seven days]. One and the same are a Gentile who was circumcised, and a maidservant who immersed herself. Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok says, there were soldiers and gate-keepers in Jerusalem who immersed and ate of their [portion of the] Passover offering in the evening. 
A syndicate as to which one of its members became impure and they do not know which one it is -- [all] need to observe Pesach Sheni. [If] a member of the [entire] community became impure and they do not know which one it is -- they observe [Passover] it in a state of impurity [but do not need to observe Pesach Sheni]. The members of a syndicate who added one [new member] to join them, even if they did it out of charity -- behold, that one receives a portion of the hide along with them. The members of a syndicate who erred and ate the Passover offering of another group -- they say to them, "You may eat ours." [If] they ate theirs, and they found a wart on the hide of one of them (which would have disqualified the animal from being sacrificed, cf. Pes. 6:1), they need to observe Pesach Sheni. [If] they observed Pesach Sheni and they erred and ate the Passover offering of another group, they say to them, "You may eat ours" (שלנו not שלכם, see GR"A). [If] they ate theirs, and they found a wart on the hide of one of them, they need to observe Pesach Sheni [again]. [In this way,] it comes out that they [could] eat four Passover offerings and [yet] not fulfill their obligation [with any of them]. Five syndicates that mixed up their Passover offerings and found a wart on the hide of one of them -- they need to observe Pesach Sheni.

Chapter 8

These [are required to] perform [Pesach] Sheni: Men and women who had abnormal discharges, menstruants, women who recently gave birth, [those who failed to observe Pesach Rishon] due to circumstances beyond their control, and those who erred unwittingly, and those who erred intentionally, and lepers, and those who had relations with a menstruant, and whoever was impure or had too far of a journey [to arrive in Jerusalem in time for Pesach Rishon]. As to these it is said (Num. 9:10), "impure ... or on a long journey," for this verse comes to exempt them from excision. Rabbi Akiva says, it says "impure <i>nefesh</i>" and it says "long journey." What is an "impure <i>nefesh</i>"? One who wants to perform [the commandment] but is unable to, and so too, [one who is on a] "long journey" wants to perform but is unable to. Rabbi Eliezer says, it says "faraway place" as to [second] tithe (Deut. 14:24), and it says "faraway place" as to Passover. What is a "faraway place"? That which is stated as to [second] tithe refers to anywhere beyond the place [designated for the tithe] to be eaten; so too, a "faraway place" as to Passover refers to anywhere beyond the place [designated for the Passover offering] to be eaten (which in both cases is Jerusalem). Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda says, [a "faraway place"] is anywhere beyond the place of performance (i.e., the Temple Courtyard, where the Passover offering is sacrificed). Said Rabbi Yosei, therefore, the <i>heh</i> has a dot over it [in the phrase בְדֶ֨רֶךְ רְחֹקָ֜הׄ ("long journey"), as written in the Torah], as if to say, "not because it is really far-off, but rather, [even] from the threshold of the Temple Courtyard and beyond." (See Pes. 9:2, Kulp tr.) Rabbi Yosei HaGalili says, a "faraway place" -- I would have concluded that [this refers to] a one day's walk or two- or three- days' walk, and therefore it says, "who has not been on a journey" (Num. 9:13), so that [we will come to learn that even] from the threshold of the Temple Courtyard and beyond is considered a "journey."
A convert who converted between the two Passovers needs to observe Pesach Sheni, the words of Rebbi. Rabbi Natan says, there is no need [for him] to observe Pesach Sheni, since he was never obligated in Pesach Rishon --[just as the obligation] of building the Chosen House was placed upon Israel (i.e., just as non-Jews are not obligated to build the Temple, and their conversion does not impose an obligation to build a Temple once it had already been built,  so too does their conversion not trigger an obligation to observe Passover once Pesach Rishon has passed). The individual [is obligated] to observe Pesach Sheni, but the community [is not obligated] to observe Pesach Sheni. Rabbi Yehuda says, even the community [is obligated] to observe Pesach Sheni. Said Rabbi Yehuda, it so happened with King Hezekiah that he had the [whole] community [of Israelites] perform Pesach Sheni, as it is said (2 Chron. 30:18), "For most of the people -- many from Efraim and from Menasheh and from Issachar and from Zebulun -- had not purified themselves [but they ate the Passover offering in violation of what is written]." Rabbi Shimon says, it wasn't because he had the community perform Pesach Sheni, but rather because he intercalculated [the month of] Nissan during Nissan, despite the fact that only [the month of] Adar may be intercalculated [during a leap year]. Rabbi Shimon bar Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon, and it was also that he had the community perform Pesach Sheni (i.e., he acted improperly both in this way and in intercalculating the month of Nissan during Nissan). § They may not form a group [of registrants comprised] of women or of slaves or of minors, so as not to drag out the prayer service (see Tos. Pesachim 4:9).
These are the things that are different between Pesach Rishon and Pesach Sheni: On Pesach Rishon there are three groups [into which the attendees are divided (see Tos. Pesachim 4:9)], but there are not three groups on Pesach Sheni. Pesach Rishon overrides impurity, but Pesach Sheni does not override impurity. Pesach Rishon renders one [who fails to observe] liable for excision, but Pesach Rishon does not render one liable for excision, the words of Rebbi. Rabbi Nathan says, even Pesach Sheni reners one liable for excision. Rabbi Chananiah ben Akavia says, if they observed Pesach Sheni they are not liable for excision for [failure to observe] Pesach Rishon, [but if] they did not observe Pesach Sheni, they are liable for excision for [not observing] Pesach Rishon. Pesach Rishon requires a Festival offering, but Pesach Sheni does not require a Festival offering. Pesach Rishon is observed all seven [days], but Pesach Sheni [only] one day.
These are the things that are similar between Pesach Rishon and Pesach Sheni: [As to] Pesach Rishon, it is said about it (Ex. 12:5), "An unblemished year-old male lamb," and so too with Pesach Sheni. [As to] Pesach Rishon, it is said about it (Ex. 12:9), "Do not eat it raw or boiled," and so too with Pesach Sheni. Pesach Rishon overrides the Sabbath and Pesach Sheni [also] overrides the Sabbath. Pesach Rishon requires staying overnight [in Jerusalem], and Pesach Sheni [also] requires staying overnight. Rabbi Yehuda says, Pesach Sheni does not require staying overnight; rather, how does he observe it? He enters [Jerusalem] and slaughters his Passover offering in the Temple Courtyard and he mourns for his forefathers in <i>Beit Pagi</i> (the wall surrounding the Temple Mount).
At a time that the Passover offering is eaten in a state of impurity (i.e., when the majority of the nation has been defiled due to contact with a corpse, see Pes. 67b:8), one who bears corpse-impurity may enter the Temple Courtyard and partake of [the Paschal lamb]. [However,] zavim and zavot (i.e., men and women who had abnormal discharges), niddot (menstruants), and yoldot (women who recently gave birth) may not enter, and if they did enter, behold, they are liable. Rabbi Eliezer says, if they entered, behold, they are exempt, as it is said (Num. 5:2), "And you shall send out from the camp any leper and any zav [and anyone with corpse-impurity]," [in order to teach that] whenever one with corpse-impurity is liable, zavim and lepers are liable, [and] whenever one with corpse-impurity is not liable, zavim and lepers are not liable. Whenever the Passover offering is brought (alt., "eaten," see Lieberman) in a state of impurity, one who bears corpse-impurity may enter the Temple Courtyard and slaughter, [but] zavim and zavot, niddot and yoldot -- behold, they may not slaughter, and if they did slaughter,  behold, they are liable. Rabbi Shimon says in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua, if they slaughtered, behold, they are exempt, as it is said (Lev. 7:19-20), "any pure person may eat the flesh, but a person who eats from a peace-offering that belongs to God [while impure, that person is cut off from his people]." [Thus, a Passover offering] that is slaughtered [by zavim, etc.] for pure persons renders them liable on its account due to impurity, [and] that which is slaughtered for impure persons does not render them liable on its account due to impurity.
On Pesach Rishon, they may slaughter [the Paschal lamb] on behalf of a woman on her own, but on Pesach Sheni, she must sustain herself next to others (i.e., she must join a syndicate), the words of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says, on Pesach Sheni they may slaughter for a woman on her own, and needless to say, on Pesach Rishon. Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon says, on Pesach Rishon, she must sustain herself next to others, and she does not observe Pesach Sheni. They said to him, it so happened with Yosef the Kohen that he brought his daughter up [to Jerusalem] to observe Pesach Sheni, and they sent her back, lest this become an obligation (i.e., there was no legal prohibition, but the Sages did not want other women to misconstrue this practice as mandatory). He said to them, [the Sages' reason for sending her back was] not "lest this become an obligation," but rather that "a woman does not observe Pesach Sheni."
These are the differences between the Passover in Egypt and the Passover of the [ensuing] generations: The Passover in Egypt -- they selected [the Paschal lamb] on the tenth [of Nissan] and slaughtered it on the fourteenth, and they were not liable for excision [for transgressing this commandment]. The Passover of the generations  -- they they are liable for excision. The Passover of Egypt -- [sheep or goats with] membranes over the eyes and cataracts were acceptable, and they [could be bought with] the fee [of a whore] or the price [of a dog] (=אתנן ומחיר, see Deut. 23:19), which is not the case with the Passover of the generations. The Passover of Egypt -- as it is said (Ex. 12:4), "[If there are too few in his house for a lamb,] he shall take it along and with his neighbor," which is not the case with the Passover of the generations. Rabbi Shimon says, I say, even in the Passover of the generations, this applies, and all the more so. Why? In order that a person not leave his close neighbor behind [alone] in his house, while he goes and prepares his Paschal lamb at his friend's house, in order to establish what is said (Prov. 27:10), "A close neighbor is better than a faraway brother." The Passover of Egypt -- the blood and fats were not required to go up on the altar, which is not the case with the Passover of the generations. The Passover of Egypt -- it is said of it (Ex. 12:22), "and apply to the lintel and the two doorposts [some of the blood]," which is not the case with the Passover of the generations. The Passover of Egypt -- it is said (<i>ibid.</i>), "and no man shall go out from the entrance of his house until morning," which is not the case with the Passover of the generations. The Passover of Egypt -- each and every one slaughters inside his house. The Passover of the generations -- all Israel slaughters in one place. The Passover of Egypt -- the place of eating [the Paschal lamb] was the same as the place of sleeping. The Passover of the generations -- they may eat it in one place and sleep in another place. [With respect to] both the Passover of Egypt and the Passover of the generations, whoever had male slaves who were not circumcised, or female slaves who had not undergone immersion -- we prevent him (or her) from partaking of the Paschal lamb (see Ex. 12:44). Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says, I say that this verse refers [only] to the Passover of Egypt.
These are the things that are similar between the Passover of Egypt and the Passover of the generations: The Passover of Egypt -- [the Israelites were divided into] three divisions, and likewise with the Passover of the generations. The Passover of Egypt -- it is said of it (Ex. 12:5), "an unblemished one-year-old male lamb," and likewise with the Passover of the generations. The Passover of Egypt -- it is said of it (Ex. 12:10), "and do not leave any of it over until the morning," and likewise with the Passover of the generations. Rabbi Yosei HaGalili says, I say, chametz was only forbidden in Egypt for one day, as it is said (Ex. 13:3-4), "...no chametz may be eaten / today [you will go out]." The Passover of Egypt requires song (i.e., the singing of Hallel), and the Passover of the generations requires song.  

Chapter 9

A Passover offering that got mixed up with an unconsecrated animal (chullin) -- he may sacrifice the unconsecrated animal for the sake of a Passover offering, and behold, they are like two offerings that got mixed up with each other, [or like] two [groups] that mixed up their Passover offering: this one takes possession of one, and that one takes possession of the other; this one registers someone from the market with him, and that one registers with him someone from the market; this one comes to the place of that one, and that one comes to the place of this one, and thus he says, "If this Passover offering is mine, you withdraw your hands from yours and you are registered for mine, and if this Passover offering is yours, I withdraw my hands from mine and I am registered for yours" (Pes. 9:11).
[If there are] two [groups] of three [registrants] each, three of four each, four of five each, five of six each, six of seven each, seven of eight each, eight of nine each, [or] nine of ten each [and their Passover offerings got mixed up], they register one person from each and every group, and two from the last group, [and this group] sets aside one Passover offering, and they say, "Whosever Passover offering is this, we withdraw our hands from ours and we register ourselves for his." [If there are] three [groups] of two [registrants] each,  four of three each, five of four each, six of five each, seven of six each, eight of seven each, nine of eight each, [or] ten of nine each [and their Passover offerings got mixed up], one person from each and every group withdraws himself [and they form a new group], and they set aside one Passover offering and say, "Whosever Passover offering is this, we withdraw our hands from ours and we register for his," and it comes out that they become attached to [the new group that] they joined, and they leave behind [the group from which they were] uprooted. § [If] he said to them [“If I delay, go and slaughter on my behalf"] or they said to him ["If we delay, go and slaughter on our behalf," and they both slaughtered an animal for a Passover offering] (see Pes. 9:9), they eat from the first [slaughtered animal]. [If] he did not say to them and they did not say to him [the aforementioned declaration, and they both slaughtered an animal], they are not responsible for each other [and they each eat from their own offering]. From this they said, "silence is befitting of the wise, and all the more so of fools." And so too it says (Prov. 17:28), "Even a fool who keeps his silence is considered wise" -- and needless to say a wise person who keeps his silence -- "and one who seals his lips is intelligent."
[If an animal designated as a Passover offering] is mixed up with [an animal designated as] a burnt offering, he brings them [both] to pasture until they develop a blemish, and then sells them, and brings the money [he received] for the more desirable one of them [to purchase] a Passover offering, or with the money [he received] for the more desirable one of them a burnt offering.  [If he already] sacrificed his Passover offering, he brings with its money another Passover offering. [If he already] sacrificed his burnt offering, he brings with its money another burnt offering. [If] it is mixed up with a thanksgiving offering, he brings them [both] to pasture until they develop a blemish, and then sells them, and brings the money [he received] for the more desirable one of them [to purchase] a Passover offering, or with the money [he received] for the more desirable one of them a thanksgiving offering.  [If he already] sacrificed his Passover offering, he brings with its money another Passover offering. [If he already] sacrificed his thanksgiving offering, he brings with its money another thanksgiving offering. [If] it is mixed up with a sin offering, he brings them [both] to pasture until they develop a blemish, and then sells them, and brings the money [he received] for the more desirable one of them [to purchase] a Passover offering, or with the money [he received] for the more desirable one of them a sin offering.  [If he already] sacrificed his Passover offering, he brings with its money another Passover offering. [If he already] sacrificed his sin offering, he brings with its money another sin offering. [If] it is mixed up with a guilt offering, he brings them [both] to pasture until they develop a blemish, and then sells them, and brings the money [he received] for the more desirable one of them [to purchase] a Passover offering, or with the money [he received] for the more desirable one of them a guilt offering.  [If he already] sacrificed his Passover offering, he brings with its money another Passover offering. [If he already] sacrificed his guilt offering, he brings with its money another guilt offering. [If it is mixed up] with a peace offering, both are brought to pasture until they develop a blemish, and then he sells them, and brings the money [he received] for the more desirable one of them [to purchase] a Passover offering, or with the money [he received] for the more desirable one of them a peace offering.  [If he already] sacrificed his Passover offering, he brings with its money another Passover offering. [If he already] sacrificed his peace offering, he brings with its money another peace offering. A peace offering that got mixed up with a peace offering that came due as a Passover offering (see Pes. 97a:5), he brings them to pasture until they develop a blemish, and then sells them, and he brings with the money [he receives] for the more desirable one of them a peace offering, and he eats it during the day and the night until midnight, or with the money [he receives] for the more desirable one of them [he brings] other peace offerings, and he eats them for two days and one night.<br>Ben Azzai says, a peace offering that became due as a Passover offering, behold, it is like a Passover offering in every regard; therefore, rather, they are eaten for one day and one night. [If] it was mixed up with a first-born, both are brought to pasture and allowed to develop a blemish, and they are eaten in the same way as a first-born. Rabbi Shimon says, this one should be slaughtered for one purpose, and that one should be slaughtered for the other purpose, and both of them should be eaten in the same way as a Passover offering, and in the way [of an animal that is] counted as a Passover offering. A first-born and [an animal separated as] tithe that were mixed up with each other, both of them are brought to pasture until they develop a blemish. Rabbi Shimon says, this one is slaughtered for one purpose, and that one is slaughtered for the other purpose, and they are both eaten as one, because the placement of their blood [on the Altar] is the same. And thus would Rabbi Shimon also say regarding a guilt offering and a peace offering that were mixed up with each other, and the Sages did not concede to Rabbi Shimon, [as they held this would be like] one who brings offerings in an unfit location. <i>In what case does this apply?</i> At a time that they were mixed up while they were alive, but  at a time that they were mixed up after they had been slaughtered, they are eaten in the manner of the most stringent one of them. [If] disqualified offerings were mixed up with [valid] offerings, or with unconsecrated animals (chullin) that were slaughtered in the Temple Courtyard, their form is allowed to decay, and they are taken out to the place of burning.
One who sets aside his Passover offering and [then] lost it, and he set aside another one in its place, and he did not have time to sacrifice it before the first one was found, and behold, both of them stand ready, he may bring whichever one he desires, in accordance with the words of the Sages. Rabbi Yosei says, the commandment is to bring the first one, and  if the second one was from the most desirable ones, he should bring the second one to pasture until it develops a blemish, and then sell it, and bring the money [he received] for it [to purchase] a peace offering for the sixteenth [of Nissan]. One who sets aside money for his Passover offering and lost it, and [then] set aside [other] money in its place, and did not have time to purchase a Passover offering with it before he found the first money -- he should bring from this [money] and from that [money and buy] a Passover offering, and sacrifice it, and with the remainder he should bring with it a peace offering for the sixteenth. One who sets aside money for his Passover offering and lost it, and [then] set aside a Passover offering in its place, and did not have time to sacrifice it before he found the money -- he should bring a Passover offering with the money  and sacrifice it, and the Passover offering [that he had set aside previously] he should bring to pasture until it develops a blemish and sell it, and use the the money to bring a peace offering on the sixteenth. One who sets aside a Passover offering and lost it, and [then] sets aside money in its place and did not have time to buy a [second] Passover offering with it before he found the [original] Passover offering -- he should sacrifice the [original] Passover offering, and with the money he should bring a peace offering on the sixteenth.
One who sets aside his Passover offering and lost it, and [then] sets aside another one in its place, and sacrifices it, and afterwards the first one is found -- he should himself sacrifice it as a peace offering on the sixteenth. One who sets aside money for a Passover offering, and lost it, and [then] sets aside other money in its place and bought with it another Passover offering, and sacrificed it, and afterwards the first money was found -- he should bring a peace offering with it on the sixteenth. 
A Passover offering that was found on the thirteenth -- it should be brought to pasture until it develops a blemish, and on the fourteenth sacrifice it as a peace offering. Rabbi Akiva says, before midday it should be brought to pasture until it develops a blemish and then he should sell it and he himself should bring a peace offering with the money and after midday he should sacrifice it as a peace offering. A Passover offering that was not sacrificed on [Pesach] Rishon should be sacrificed on [Pesach] Sheni. [If] it was not sacrificed on [Pesach] Sheni it should be sacrificed on [Pesach] Shelishi. Money that was not [used to bring a] sacrifice on Rishon, should be [used to bring a] sacrifice on Sheni. [If] it was not [used to bring a] sacrifice on Sheni, it should be [used to bring a] sacrifice on Shelishi. A Festival offering that was not sacrificed on Rishon is sacrificed on Sheni. [If] it was not sacrificed on Sheni it should be sacrificed on Shelishi.
One who sets aside money for [the purpose of purchasing] his Passover offering and [then] dies -- if his son was registered with him, he brings them after him for the sake of a Passover offering, and if not, he brings them as a peace offering on the sixteenth [of Nissan]. One who sets aside his Passover offering and  [then] dies - if his son was registered with him, he brings it after him for the sake of a Passover offering, and if not he brings it as a peace offering on the sixteenth.
A substitute (<i>temurah</i>) of a Passover offering, the offspring of a substitute of a Passover offering, and their offspring, and the offspring of their offspring, and so on until the end of the world -- he brings them to pasture until they develop a blemish, and he sells them and brings a peace offering with their money (i.e., the money derived from their sale). Rabbi Eliezer says, the offspring themselves are brought as peace offerings. The substitute of a peace offering, the offspring of a substitute of a peace offering, their offspring, the offspring of their offspring, and so on until the end of the world -- he brings them to pasture until they develop a blemish and he sells them and brings a peace offering with their money. Rabbi Eliezer says, the offspring themselves are brought as a peace offering. One who sets aside a female as his burnt offering, as his Passover offering, [or] as his guilt offering makes a substitute. Rabbi Shimon says, for his burnt offering he makes a substitute, [but] he may not make a substitute for his Passover offering or for his guilt offering; rather, these are not things with which one can make a substitute. Rather, these are things that one can take to pasture and allow to develop a blemish. Said Rebbi, the words of Rabbi Shimon are preferable to me for a Passover offering, for one who sacrifices a Passover offering [also] brings a peace offering.
One who sets aside a female for his Passover offering brings her to pasture until she develops a blemish and then sells her, and he brings a Passover offering with her money (i.e., the money derived from the sale of the female). Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon, he may sell her [even] without a blemish. If she gave birth to a male, he brings him (i.e., the male offspring) to pasture until he develops a blemish and then he sells him, and he brings a Passover offering with his money. Rabbi Eliezer says, he himself is sacrificed as a Passover offering.

Chapter 10

In the evening of Pesach, around Mincha, a man should not eat until dark; even the poorest in Israel should not eat until he reclines.  They (the community) should give him no fewer than 4 cups of wine [(each of which) contains at least a <i>revi'it</i>, whether unmixed or mixed, whether new or old. R' Yehuda says, it should at least have the taste and color of wine.
They mix him the first cup. Beit Shammai says, he blesses on the day and then he blesses on the wine, because the holiday is the direct reason for drinking the wine, and the holiday had already started when the wine was brought to the table. Beit Hillel says, he blesses on the wine and then he blesses on the day, because if we didn't have the wine we wouldn't be saying Kiddush on the holiday at all. Another explanation: the blessing on wine is regularly said and the blessing on the holiday is not. And the halacha is according to Beit Hillel.
It is a mitzvah for a person to make his children and the members of his house happy on the festivals. Through what [should he make them happy]? With wine! [As it is written (Psalm 104): "And wine will make the heart of man happy, etc."]. Rabbi Yehudah said: [Women] with what is nice for them and children with what is nice for them.
The attendant dips the intestines and places them in front of the guests. Even though there is no proof for this matter, there is at least a hint, as it is said (Jer. 4:3, JPS tr.), "Break up the untilled ground, And do not sow among thorns." The one who recites the Hallel -- they go to his place and recite it, and he does not go to their place. The one who recites [the Hallel] to his minor sons and daughters needs to answer with them at the place that they [are required to] answer. <i>In which place does he answer [with them]?</i> When he comes to "May he who enters be blessed" (Ps. 118:26, JPS tr.), he says with them "in the name of the Lord." When he comes to "We bless you" (<i>ibid.</i>), he says with them "from the House of the Lord."
The townsfolk that have no one who can read the Hallel go to the synagogue and they read the first chapter, and [then] they go [back home] and eat and drink, and [afterwards] they return [to the synagogue] and finish the entirety [of the Hallel]. And if this [i.e., going a second time to the synagogue] is not possible for them, they complete the entirety [of the Hallel on their initial trip, before they eat and drink]. [With respect to] the Hallel, we do not shorten it and we do not add to it.
Rabbi Eliezer says, "We snatch the matzot for the small children so that they don't fall asleep." Rabbi Yehuda said in his name, "Even if he only ate one entree, even if he only dipped one [piece of] lettuce, we snatch the matzot for the small children so that they don't fall asleep." Up until [which point in <i>Hallel</i> - Psalms of thanksgiving recited joyously and communally on many festivals] should one recite [before the meal]?  Beit Shammai says, "Up to [the verse that ends with the phrase] 'A happy mother of children'" (Psalms 113:9).  Beit Hillel says, "Up to [the verse that ends with the phrase] 'flint stone into a water-spring'" (Psalms 114:8). And one should conclude [this section of <i>Hallel</i> with [the blessing of] redemption. Beit Shammai, said to Beit Hillel, "And did they already go out [of Egypt at this time] that we [already] mention the going out of Egypt?" Beit Hillel said [back] to them, "Even if he waits for the call of the rooster, behold, they didn't go out until six hours into the day; how is it that he says 'the redemption' [when] they have not yet been redeemed?"
[They bring the leader] the matzah, the lettuce, and the <i>charoset</i>, even though the <i>charoset</i> is not mandatory (see Pes. 10:3).  Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Tzadok says, it is mandatory. And in the Temple they would bring the body of the Pesach [offering] before him. It would happen that Rabbi Eliezer son of Rebbi would say to the merchants of Lod, come and bring "spices for the meritorious deed" [i.e., <i>charoset</i>, see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim_10.3.3" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.10.3.3">Y. Pes. X.3.3</a>].
We may not eat an <i>afikoman</i> [a dessert or other foods eaten after the meal] after [we are finished eating] the Pesach sacrifice; for example nuts, dates and roasted wheat. A man is obligated to be involved with the laws of Pesach the whole night, even if it [is only a discussion] between him and his son, even if it is between him and himself, even if it is between him and his student. It happened that Rabban Gamliel and the Elders were [once] reclining in the house of Beitos ben Zunin in Lud, and they were involved with the laws of Pesach the whole night until the call of the rooster. [Their students] raised the covering of the window from in front of them, and they [then] convened and went to the house of study. What is the blessing on the Pesach sacrifice? Blessed [...] who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us on the eating of the Pesach sacrifice. What is the blessing on the [other] offerings? Blessed [...] who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us on the eating of the offering.
