Tosefta Yoma



Chapter 1

Why do they separate the Kohen Gadol from his household to Lishkat Parhedrin. The explanation of Rabbi Yehuda Ben Betira is that he may be with his wife, and there is a doubt as to whether she is a Niddah and he would become impure in the seven days before Yom Kippur. There was another reading that he was taken to Lishkat Barvatan.
All the chambers in the Beit Hamikdash were exempt from mezuzah aside from Lishkat Parhedrin because it was a residence for the Kohen Gadol seven days a year. Rabbi Yehudah said if it wasn't a living space there, all living spaces are obligated.
All the chambers in the Temple are considered a private domain for Shabbat and a public domain for impurity, except for the Chamber of the Wine and Oil, which have two entrances, this one opposite that one. Abba Shaul would call it the "Chamber of the House of Shamnia." Rabbi Yehuda says, every chamber that is in the Temple that has two entries in it, this one opposite that one, such as the gate of the Temple Courtyard, is a private domain for Shabbat and a public domain for impurity.
For what reason do they set aside another Kohen to serve in his stead lest he become disqualified? He serves in his stead and the High Priest returns to his status in the High Priesthood, and the one that served in his stead, all the mitzvot of the High Priesthood are incumbent on him, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei says, even though they said that "all the mitzvot of the High Priesthood are incumbent on him," [once he has acted as a substitute High Priest] he is not fit neither to be the High Priest nor to perform the functions of an ordinary Kohen. Said Rabbi Yosei, it so happened with Yosef ben Eilim from Tzippori that he served on behalf of the High Priest for one hour and [after that] he was not fit either as a High Priest nor as an ordinary Kohen. When he went out, he said to the King, "The bull and the goat that were sacrificed today, who were they from (i.e., whose property were they)? From me or from the High Priest?" The King knew what he was talking about, [and the King said] to him, "What is this, ben Eilim? It is not enough for you that you performed the service in the place of the High Priest one hour before He Who spoke and the world came into being? Rather, what you are seeking is to take the High Priesthood with you." At that very hour, ben Eilim knew that he had been removed from the High Priesthood.
How does the High Priest "take a portion ahead [of the other Kohanim]" (see Yoma 1:2)?  He says, "This is my sin-offering" or "This is is my guilt-offering," [or] "One of the two loaves [is mine]," [or] "Four or five loaves from the showbread [is mine]." Rebbi says, I say, he can retain half for himself, as it is said (Lev. 2:3), "And what is left over from the grain-offering is for Aaron and his sons," that [the portion for] Aaron would be weighed against [the portion for] his sons. <i>In what case does this apply?</i> With holy things of the Temple, but as to holy things of the outlying areas, whether one is the High Priest or an ordinary Kohen, their portions are divided equally. 
It is a commandment that the High Priest ("Kohen Gadol") be greater ("gadol") than his brothers, in prophecy, in strength, in wealth, in wisdom, and in appearance. Where is it derived that if he lacks these, that his brothers should [take it upon themselves to] make him great? As it is said (Lev. 21:10): "And the Kohen who is greater ("gadol") than his brothers [etc.]" -- that his brothers make him great. They said of Pinchas the Man of Chavata, upon whom the lot fell to become the High Priest, that the Temple treasurers and officers went looking for him and they found that he was a stone-cutter, and on his account they filled up the quarry [where he was working] with gold dinars. Said Rabbi Chananiah ben Gamaliel, "Was he really a stone-cutter? Rather, he was our son-in-law, and they found him plowing, just as it is said of Elisha (1 Kings 19:19), 'There were twelve yokes of oxen [ahead of him], and he was the twelfth.'" When there became many kings, they decreed that Kohanim would be appointed [as High Priests], and they would set them aside [for appointment] each and every year.
Why did [the Kohen Gadol] turn aside and weep (Yoma 1:5)? Because [the Elders] have to make him take an oath, for there had already been an incident involving one Boethusian who offered up the incense when he was outside [the Holy of Holies] and the cloud of incense heated up the whole Temple, for the Boethusians say that the incense should be offered up while he is outside, as it is said (Lev. 16:13), "And the cloud of incense shall cover [the Curtain]." The Sages said to them, is it not already stated (ibid.), "He shall place the incense on the fire before God" (וְנָתַ֧ן אֶֽת־הַקְּטֹ֛רֶת עַל־הָאֵ֖שׁ לִפְנֵ֣י ה׳, see GR"A here)? It (i.e., the second part of the verse) teaches that we add the smoke-raising herb [to the incense]. Thus, if one does not add the smoke-raising herb, he is liable for the death penalty. When he came out he said to his fathers, "All your days you were explicating [the verses] and you did not perform it until I stood there and did it myself." He said to him, "Even though we explicate, we do not perform it [as we explicate it], and we hearken to the words of the Sages. I would be astounded for you if your days were to last." And it was not three days after this that they placed him in his grave.
Which one is the "tzeredah" finger [that the priests would snap (Yoma 1:7)? It is the big finger of the right hand. With the mouth and not with the lyre and not with harp. What would they say (Ps. 127:1, JPS Tr.), "A song of ascents, Of Solomon / Unless the Lord builds the House [its builders labor in vain on it]." They would not sleep the whole night; rather, they would recite [Scripture] opposite the High Priest to keep him occupied in Torah. And so too would they comport themselves in the provinces after the destruction of the Temple. [They did so as a] remembrance of the Temple but they sinned by doing so.
How do they conduct the lottery in the Chamber of Hewn Stone? They make a circle and they stand like a necklace (ככוליור), and the registrants come, and he takes a headdress from one of them, and they knew that the count for the lottery would start with him (see Jastrow, מִצְנֶפֶת). They would not stick out two [fingers]; rather, one for each of them. [If] they stuck out two [fingers], they would not count the extra ones. Rabbi Yehuda says, they would not conduct a lottery for the coal-pan; rather, whoever won [the lottery] of the incense, he says to him, "You also are [assigned] to the coal-pan." Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says, there was not a lottery for the fats of the goat, but whoever brought the limbs up the ramp offers them up [as well] on top of the Altar.
It happened that two priests were running to go up the ramp. One pushed his fellow into the four cubit space. He took a knife and stabbed him in the chest. R. Zadok came and stood on the steps leading up the Ulam and said, "Hear me my Israelite brothers. Behold it says, (Deuteronomy 21) 'When one finds a dead body...and the elders and judges shall go out and measure...' Let us measure who should bring the calf, the sanctuary or the courtyards." Everyone groaned and cried. Afterwards the father of the young [priest] came and said, "My brothers, I am your atonement. My son's pulse is still beating and the knife has not yet been defiled." This shows that the impurity of the knife was more difficulty for Israel than bloodshed. And so it says, "Moreover, Manasseh put so many innocent persons to death that he filled Jerusalem [with blood] from end to end." From here they said, "Through the sin of bloodshed the Shekhinah departs and the Temple is defiled."  
The [Kohen] designated [to conduct the lottery] says to them, "Come and draw lots, who shall slaughter, who shall sprinkle, who shall remove the ashes from the inner Altar, who shall remove the ashes from the candelabra, who shall bring the limbs up the ramp -- the head and the hind leg and the two forelegs, the tail and the [other] hind leg, the breast and the throat, the two flanks, and the intestines, and the fine flour, and the pancakes, and the wine" -- these are the words of Rabbi Shimon Ish HaMitzpeh. Rabbi Yosei says, [rather], the head and the hind leg, and the two forelegs, the the breast and the tail and the two flanks, the tail and the [other] hind leg. Said Ben Azzai to Rabbi Akiva in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua, [rather,] the way it walked was how it was sacrificed -- the head and the hind leg, the breast and the throat, and the two forelegs and the two flanks, the tail, and the [other] hind leg. Thirteen merited [to be selected in the lottery], sometimes fourteen, sometimes fifteen.
The ram was sacrificed by eleven (Yoma 2:7), the communal lambs by eight, who did not have pancakes with them, the bull was sacrificed by twenty-four. [As to] the head and the hind leg -- two take hold of the leg and carry it up to the top of the Altar, [and then] three take hold of it and offer it up on top of the Altar. <i>In what case does this apply?</i> With regard to the communal offerings, but individual offerings -- anyone who wants to sacrifice may sacrifice. It so happened with the son of Marta, the daughter of Baitos, that he was one of those who [was so strong that he] could carry two thighs of a bull with [only] two fingers, [and that bull was so big that it] cost one thousand dinars, and yet he could walk up [the ramp] heel to toe, and [in that fashion] carry [the thighs] up to the top of the Altar.  
What is the meaning of, "[It is light] over the face of the eastern sky until Hebron" (see Yoma 3:1)? There were times that a column [of light from] the sun ascended in the manner of a column [of light from] the moon and spreads over the entire face of the eastern sky. Abba Yosei ben Chanan says, [the watcher would say,] "It is getting light, it is radiant!" 
A High Priest who leaves the Temple Courtyard to speak with his fellow or interrupts [his service], is required to immerse [himself]. They asked Ben Zoma, what is the idea behind this "immersion"? He said to them, if he enters from the Holy to the Holy -- a place where there is no punishment of excision [if he becomes impure] -- he is required to immerse, [then if] he enters from a profane place to the Holy -- a place where there is punishment of excision -- is it not logical that he should be required to immerse [as well]? Rabbi Yehuda says, this immersion was only due to discipline (סֶרֶךְ not צורך, see Y. Yoma III.3.4), for sometimes old impurity [may be] in his hand, and while he is going to immerse [himself], he remembers that he is impure and turns back. 
Kohanim that did not sanctify their hands and feet [by washing], and so too a High Priest who did not immerse and did not sanctify his hands and feet between one service and another service, or between [changing from] one set of garments to another set of garments, and [then] performed a service -- their service is valid, but Kohanim who did not immerse and did not sanctify their hands and feet, so too a High Priest who did not immerse and did not sanctify his hands and feet from the basin [of the Temple], and performed a service -- their service is invalid. Either a High Priest or an ordinary Kohen that performed a morning service and did not wash their hands and their feet are liable for the death penalty, as it is said (Ex. 30:43, JPS Tr.), "[The linen breeches shall be worn by Aaron and his sons] when they enter the Tent of Meeting [so that they do not incur punishment and die]." [Even if] he was standing and sacrificing the whole night (i.e., without an opportunity for a nocturnal emission), he is required to sanctify his hands and feet. Rebbi says, staying overnight [even without sleeping] disqualifies the [prior] sanctification of his hands and feet. Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon says, even one who is occupied in [Temple] service all seven days of the week, staying overnight does not disqualify the [prior] sanctification of his hands and feet.
Five immersions were performed there on the same day, all of them in the Holy in the House of Parvit (Yoma 3:3), except for the first, which was [performed] in a profane place, on top of the Water Gate, which was to the side of his chamber. Rabbi Yehuda says, they prepared wrought iron bars for Yom Kippur Eve, and they would pour [the water heated with these bars] into the cold [water provided to the priest] in order to reduce the coldness (see Yoma 3:5).  
[The Mishnah, Yoma 3:7, records that the Priestly garments cost either eight hundred zuz or thirty maneh. But according to the Tosefta,] everything [cost] sixty maneh. These were taken from the consecrated [Temple funds]. If he wanted to add, he may add his own [money]. It so happened with Ishmael ben Pavi, that his mother made him a tunic worth one hundred maneh, and he would stand and sacrifice on top of the Altar [wearing it]. And there was another incident with Elazar ben Harsum, that his mother made him a tunic worth twenty thousand maneh, and he stood and sacrificed on top of the Altar [wearing it], but his fellow Kohanim brought him down because he appeared naked from within [the fabric]. A woman who makes a tunic for her son -- it is fit [to be worn] as long as she surrenders it to the public. It is the same for the garments of the High Priest as for the garments of an ordinary Kohen -- [everything] comes from the collection of the [Temple] Treasury.

Chapter 2

How does [the High Priest] confess? He says, "Please, Hashem, I have done wrong, I have transgressed, I have sinned before You -- I and my house. Please, Hashem, grant atonement please on the wrongdoings, and on the transgressions, and on the sins that I have wronged, and that I have transgressed, and that I have sinned before You -- I and my house, as it is written in the Torah of Moses Your servant (Lev. 16:30), 'Because on this day He will grant atonement upon you, etc.,' and it says (Lev. 16:21), "And he (i.e., Aaron) shall confess over [the goat that is sent away] all the wrongdoings of the Children of Israel, and all of their transgressions, for all of their sins." [These are] the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, "wrongdoings" -- these are willful acts; "transgressions" -- these are rebellious acts; "sins" -- these are unintentional acts, for after he confesses on the willful acts and on the rebellious acts, he returns and confesses on the unintentional acts. Rather, how does he confess [according to the Sages]? "Please, Hashem, I have sinned, I have done wrong, I have transgressed before You. Please, Hashem, grant atonement please, for the sins, for the wrongdoings, and for the transgressions that I have sinned, and that I have done wrong, and that I have transgressed before You -- I and my house, as it is written in the Torah of Moses Your servant, 'Because on this day He will grant atonement upon you to purify you, etc.'" And they (i.e., the congregants) answer him, "Blessed be the glorious Name, etc.," for this is the manner in which we find all the confessions of David [were performed], [for] it says (Ps. 106:6), "We have sinned like our fathers [before us], we have done wrong, and we have done evil." [And] Solomon says (1 Kings 8:47), "We have sinned, we have done wrong, we have done evil." [And] Daniel says (Dan. 9:5), "We have sinned, and we have done wrong, and we have done evil, and we have rebelled.” However, what is it that Moses says? [He says,] "He forgives wrongdoing and transgression and sin, and cleanses" (Ex. 34:7). Nevertheless, this is how the confession was done -- "I have sinned, and I have done wrong, and I have transgressed before You."  
He comes to the east of the Altar and then to the north of the Altar, the Deputy [High Priest] on his right and the Head of the Beit Din on his left. The two goats were in front of them, facing the people, and behind them was the Holy. Then the High Priest [turned and] faced toward the Holy. Ten times he recited the ineffable Name on that very day -- six for the bull, three for the goat, and one for the lots. And the urn was there, and in it were the two lots, which had been made of boxwood, until Ben Gamla fashioned them from gold, and his name is remembered for praise.  
Ben Katin fashioned twelve spigots for the [Temple] basin [so that] twelve Kohanim could sanctify themselves [by simultaneously washing their hands and feet] with it, for originally there were only two [spigots] and two Kohanim could sanctify themselves from them [at one time], and his name is remembered for praise. King Munbaz fashioned all the handles of the knives used on Yom Kippur from gold, and his name is remembered for praise. Queen Helena his mother fashioned a candelabra from gold that was [placed] on the entrance to the Heichal. Also, she fashioned a tablet of gold on which the portion of the Sotah was written, from which sparks would burst out as soon as the sun rose, and thus it would known that the sun had risen. [And] all the gates that were there were changed to be of gold, except for the Gates of Nicanor, because a miracle was done with them, and there are those who say because they were [made from] copper that gleamed like gold. Rabbi Elazar ben Yaakov says, [from] Corinthian Copper, and it was as beautiful as gold.  
What was the miracle that occurred with [the Gates of Nicanor]? They said that Nicanor was bringing them from Alexandria, which is in Egypt. There arose a storm [capable of] drowning them (i.e., those on the ship with Nicanor), and they took one of them and cast it into the sea, and they sought to cast the second one [as well], and Nicanor could not put them at ease. He said to them, if you cast the second one, then cast me along with it. He was distressed all the way until he arrived at the port of Jaffa. No sooner had he arrived at the port of Jaffa, then bubbles started rising from under the ship, and there are those who say, that one of the sea creatures swallowed it, and as soon as Nicanor arrived at the port of Jaffa, it vomited it up and spewed it out onto dry land, and on their account it is explicitly stated in the received [scripture] (Song of Songs 1:17, JPS Tr.), "Cedars are the beams of our house [and] cypresses the rafters." (Note: Per the Bavli, Yoma 38a:4, the word for "cypresses" (בְּרוֹתִֽים) and instead be read as "covenant of the sea" (בְּרִית יָם), a reference to this event.)  
Those of the House of Garmu were highly skilled in making the showbread, and they did not want to impart their knowledge [to others]. The Sages sent forth and brought experts from Alexandria, which is in Egypt, that would bake just like them, but they were not experts in removing [the showbread from the oven]. Those of the Hous of Garmu would light the oven from the outside and would remove [the showbread] from the inside. Those of Alexandria were not able to do so, and there are those who say that it got moldy. And once the Sages learned of the matter, they said, "The Place only created the world for His own gloroy," as it is said (Is. 43:7), "All who are call out with My Name [etc.]." [The Sages] sent for them, but they did not come until they doubled their salary. They had given them twelve maneh every day, and when they came back they gave them twenty-four maneh every day -- the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says, twenty-four [maneh] they would give them every day, and when they came back they gave them forty-eight maneh. The Sages said to them, "What did you see that you did not want to impart your knowledge." They said, "It was known to the house of our fathers that in the future the Holy Temple would be destroyed, and we did not want to teach [others] so that it would not be made before [objects of] idolatry in the same way that it is made before the Place." And on this matter their name is remembered for praise, that [ritually] clean bread is never found in the hands of their sons, or in the hands of their daughters, so that it is not said of them, that they satiate themselves with showbread, to fulfill that which is said (Num. 32:22), "And they shall be clean before the Lord."  
Those from the House of Avtinas were highly skilled in [mixing] the spices of the incense with the smoke-raising herb and did not want to impart their knowledge [to others]. The Sages sent forth and brought experts from Alexandria, from Egypt, who could mix together any spice, but they were not proficient with the smoke-raising herb. That of the House of Avtinas would rise straight up to the ceiling, and after that spread out and descend below, [while] that of Alexandria would spread out immediately. When the matter became known to the Sages, they said, "God only created the world for His glory," as it is said (Prov. 16:4), "[God] created everything for a purpose." The Sages sent forth to them, but they did not come until they doubled their wages. Twelve maneh they had given them every day, but they went back and gave them twenty-four, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says, twenty-four they would give them every day, and they went back and gave them forty-eight maneh. The Sages said to them, "Why did you see fit not to impart your knowledge?" They said to them, "It was known to the house of our fathers that in the future the Temple will be destroyed, and they did not want to impart their knowledge, so that incense would not be brought before objects of idolatry in the same way that it is brought before the Place." And in this matter they were remembered as praiseworthy: that no woman ever went out perfumed from among them, and not only that, but when their women would get married in another place, they would make an agreement with her that she would not perfume herself, so that the Jewish people would not say that she perfumed herself from the [mixing of] the spices of the incense, to fulfill what it says (Num. 32:22), "And they shall be found blameless before God and before Israel."   
Said Rabbi Akiva, Shimon ben Liga related to me: I and one of the children from among their descendants were harvesting herbs in the field. I someone laughing and crying. I said to him, "Why are you crying?" He said to me, "About the honor of the house of my father, which has diminished." I said to him, "Why are you laughing?" He said, "About the end of days to come, [when] the Holy One Blessed Be He will bring happiness to his children." I said to him, "What did you see?" He said, "The smoke-raising herb is here before me." I said to him, "Show it to me." He said to me, "We have sworn an oath among us not to show it to any person." Said Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri, one time I was walking on the road, and I found an old man, and he told me, "I am from the House of Avtinas. In the beginning, those who lived in the house of my father were humble, and they passed down the traditions [contained in] their scroll, this one to that one. Now, take this scroll with you and be enlightened by it, for this is the scroll containing the identifiers [of the smoke-raising herb]." And thereafter I came and repeated these words before Rabbi Akiva. He said to me, "From this moment onward, it is forbidden to disparage their name." From this [episode] Ben Azzai said, "From your own they shall give you, in your name they shall call you, and in your place they shall seat you. No one is forgotten before God, [and] no person may touch that which is prepared for his fellow." (See Yoma 38b:1.)  
Agadim ben Levi knew a chapter of song and did not want to impart his knowledge [to others] (see Yoma 3:11). The Sages said to him, "What did you see that you did not want to impart your knowledge?" He said to them, "It was known in the house of my fathers that in the future the Holy Temple would be destroyed, and they did not want to impart their knowledge, so that [songs would not be] recited before objects of idolatry in the same way that they are recited before the Place." Ben Kamtzar knew the art of writing and did not want to impart his knowledge [to others]. They said to him, "What did you say that you did not want to impart these things to them?" [As to all of the aforementioned,] they found an answer to the words of the [Sages], [but] Ben Kamtzar [and his associates] did not find an answer to their words. The sought to increase their honor and to diminish the honor of Heaven; therefore, their honor was diminished and the honor of Heaven was increased. And there is not found among them a good name or a good remembrance. On the first ones, it is said (Prov. 10:7), "The righteous is remembered for a blessing," and on these ones, it is said (ibid.), "And the name of the wicked shall rot."  
[The High Priest] mixes up [the lots] in the urn and brings up the two lots, one in his right hand and one in his left hand. If [the lot "For Hashem"] came up in his right hand, all of Israel were joyous, and if it came up in his left hand, all of Israel were not joyous. They asked Rabbi Akiva, what if he switches them from left to right? He said to them, do not give [heretics] a chance to come down on you (לרדות אחריהם, see Lieberman). Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, the deputy and the High Priest would take out two in their right hands at once, and if [the lot "For Hashem"] was in the right hand of the High Priest, the deputy would ascend and say, "My Master, the High Priest, please raise your right hand." And if it was in the right hand of the deputy, the head of the house of the fathers would ascend and say, "My Master, the High Priest, please raise your left hand," and [thus the lots] were placed on the two goats. He says, "For Hashem," and the deputy says, "For a sin offering." Rabbi Yishmael says, he did not have to say "a sin offering." They said to him, is it not already stated (Lev. 16:9, JPS Tr.), "Which he is to offer as a sin offering"?  
Every day, two Kohanim enter [the Temple] -- one with the shovel and one with the coal-pan. Today, one carries the coal-pan with his right hand and the shovel with his left hand. In what case does this apply? As to the incense of the innermost part of the Sanctuary, but as to the incense of the gold Altar, behold, it is like the incense of the rest of the days of the year. Every day, [the coal pan] was heavy, but on this day it was light. Every day it was short and on this day it was long, so that the forearm could assist him. Every day, [the handle of the coal pan] did not have a ring, but today it had a ring, the words of the son of the deputy [High Priest]. Every day there were two wood piles and today there were three, one was the large wood pile, and and one was the small wood pile, and there was one that they would add for the incense, that is [brought] in the innermost part of the Sanctuary, the words of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei adds one for the maintenance of the fire. Rebbi adds one for the limbs and the fats that had not been consumed by the evening. 
He entered and walked inside the Heichal until he stood between the gold Altar and the candelabra, and the Altar was in front of him. The Table was placed in the northern third of the Temple. removed from the wall by two and a half amot. The gold Altar was in the middle between them, opposite two of the poles of the Ark, and removed [from the wall], facing the Altar, and everything was placed from the [inner] half of the Temple and inward. He walks to the Heichal before he arrives between the two Curtains which divide the Holy from the Holy of Holies, and between them was an amah. This is the place that was spoken of, that Solomon made. Rabbi Yosei says, there was only one Curtain there, as it is said (Ex. 26:33, JPS), "And the Curtain shall serve you as a partition [between the Holy and the Holy of Holies]." They said to him, what is meant by the words, "between the Holy and the Holy of Holies"? He said to them, between the upper Holy and the lower Holy. Another version -- between Nob and Gibeon and Shiloh and the outside of the Eternal House. The outer Curtain was looped on the south side and the inner Curtain was looped on the north side (Yoma 5:1, Kulp tr.). He walked between them until he arrived at the north. He arrived at the north, he turned to face the south, and he walked to his left alongside the Curtain until he arrived at the Ark, and then he pushed the Curtain with his hips, and he put the coal pan between the two poles, and heaped up the incense on top of the coals, and filled the House with smoke. He goes out in the same way that he came in, and he prays a short prayer in the outside of the House, and he would not prolong [his prayer] so as not to provoke anxiety in Israel. It so happened with a certain High Priest that he prolonged [his prayer]. They said to him, "What did you see that you prolonged it?" He said to them, "I prayed on your account, and on the sanctity of your fathers, that it will not be destroyed." They said, "Even in that case, you do not have the right to change [the custom]." 
There was a stone there from the days of the first prophets, and it was called foundation, elevated three fingers above the ground. In the beginning the ark was placed on it. Once the ark was taken away they would burn the incense which was offered in the inner chamber upon it. R’ Yose said that from it the world was founded as it says, “From Tzion, the perfection of beauty…appeared.” (Tehillim 50:2)
The jar of the manna, and the flask of anointing oil, and the staff of Aaron with its almonds and blossoms, and the chest that the Philistines brought in honor of the God of Israel -- all of these were within the Holy of Holies, [but] from the time that the Ark was hidden away, they were hidden away with it. Two staves projected out from the Ark until they reached the Curtain, as it is said (1 Kings 8:8), "The staves projected out...." Perhaps [we should conclude that] they were not seen from within it (i.e., the Holy of Holies)? Therefore, the verse states (ibid.), "and the ends of the staves could be seen [from the Holy, in front of the Sanctuary]." Perhaps they rent open the Curtain? Therefore, the verse states (ibid.), "and they were not seen outside of it." It is said that from that point onward, the staves extended out and reached the Curtain and pushed against the Curtain. They were seen within it and on top of it, as is stated explicitly in our received tradition (Song of Songs 1:13), "Like a bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me, lying between my breasts ."
[The High Priest] takes the blood from the one who was stirring it, and enter where he had [previously] entered, and stands in the place where he had stood (Yoma 5:3), and sprinkles from it on the Curtain opposite the two staves of the Ark, once upwards and seven times downwards, but he did not direct the sprinkling either upward or downward; rather, [his hand arced] like one who cracks a whip. Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, this is how he would count: "One. One and one. One and two. One and three. One and four. One and five. One and six. One and seven." And afterwards he would walk to the left until the Curtain, but he would not touch the Curtain. [Nonetheless,] if he touched it, so be it. Said Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei, I saw in Rome that there were drops of blood on [the Curtain], and they told me, "These are from the blood of Yom Kippur."

Chapter 3

When he comes to circle the Altar, from where does he start? From the "horn" on the northeastern [corner], [followed by] the northwestern, southwestern, [and] southeastern. On the place that he starts the sin offering on the outer Altar, he finishes sprinkling [the blood of the bull and goat] on the inner Altar. On all of them he sprinkles from the bottom upwards, except for that which he was standing before, which he would sprinkle from the top downward (Yoma 5:5). Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, he would stand in his place and sprinkle, and on all of [the corners] he would sprinkle from the bottom upward, except for that which he was standing before, against which he sprinkled in a diagonal line (אלכסון), from the top downward.
[The Mishnah, Yoma 5:6, states,] "He sprinkled on the <i>tahar</i> of the Altar seven times." [What is the meaning of "tahar"?] He would not sprinkle either on the ashes or on the coals; rather on the top of the Altar, and it would arc (נכפפת) toward the wall. He would dip [his finger in the blood] for each sprinkling. [If] he sprinkled on the horn from this side and from that side, it is valid. From the horn and inward, it is invalid.
[If] he repeats the sprinkling on the horns, it is invalid. [If] he neglects even one of the sprinklings, it is invalid. [If] he advances the sprinkling of the seven before the sprinkling of the four, he goes back and places some of the blood of the seven into the blood of the four. Once he completes the sprinkling that is [performed] inside, he has fulfilled [his obligation], and he pours the remaining blood on the western base of the outer Altar, and that of the outer Altar he would pour on the southern base. Rabbi Shimon says, this one and that one, on the base of the western [Altar]. Both of them became mixed together in the aqueduct and flowed out to the Kidron River, and they were sold to gardeners as fertilizer, and they would engage in improper use of Temple property (meilah) with them, the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, there is no "improper use of Temple property" with blood.
Regarding every act of Yom Kippur stated in the order [of the service], [if] he advanced one act before another, he has not done anything (Yoma 5:7), except for taking out the shovel and the coal pan, which if he advanced that act before another, what he has done is done. Said Rabbi Yehuda, in what case does this apply? To things that are performed inside [the Holy] in the white priestly garments, but to things that are performed outside in golden priestly garments, even though he advanced one act before another, as to all such acts, what he has done is done. [If] he sprinkled some of the sprinklings inside [the Holy] and poured out the blood, he brings other [blood], and starts from the beginning from inside. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say, from the place that he stopped [he may resume]. [If] he completed the sprinklings that are [required to be performed] on the Curtain and is inside, and sprinkled some of the sprinklings that are [required to be performed] outside on the Altar, and poured out the blood, he brings other [blood], and starts from the beginning on the Altar. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon said, from the place that he stopped [he may resume]. [If] he completed the sprinklings that [are required to be performed] on top of the Altar and poured out the blood, [not] sprinkling on the base of the Altar does not prevent [the fulfillment of the obligation]. And all of [the animals whose blood is spilled] render the garments impure, and [the animals are] burned in the ash pit, the words of Rabbi Elazar. And Rabbi Shimon and the Sages say, they do not render the garments impure, and they are not burned in the ash pit, except for the last [animal], since only that one completes the service [and completes atonement, see Yoma 61b:9].
Said Rabbi Yosei, this is the sign: Anything taken out from inside [the Holy of Holies] to be placed outside, is taken from that which is adjacent to the inside, and anything taken from inside to be placed outside, is placed on that which is adjacent to the inside. [If] he took some of the blood of the bull from inside to outside, [or] some of the blood of the goat from inside to outside, the inside [blood] ascended [to Heaven] for him and the outside [blood] did not ascend for him. [If] he sprinkled some of the sprinklings that are [required to be performed] inside, and poured out the blood, he should bring another and start from the beginning on the Curtain. [If] he sprinkled some of the sprinklings [that are required to be performed] on the Altar and poured out the blood, even though he did not place it next to the base [of the Altar], he fulfilled [his obligation], as it is said (Lev. 16:20), "When he has finished atoning [etc.]." If he has effected atonement, he has completed [his service], the words of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yehuda says, if he has completed [his service], he has effected atonement. [Failure to] pour out the blood on the base is not required [to effect atonement]; and anything [that is poured out] against the base fulfills [the obligation], as it is said (ibid.), "When he has finished atoning [etc.]."
The bull and the goat of Yom Kippur that were lost, and others were set aside in their place, and there was not enough [time] to sacrifice them before the first ones were found -- they shall be left to graze until they develop a blemish and [then] they shall be sold, and he brings a freewill offering with their money (i.e., the money derived from their sale), for a public guilt-offering is not [left] to die (Yoma 6:1). Rabbi Yehuda says, it shall be [left] to die, and moreover, said Rabbi Yehuda, [if] the blood is poured out, the goat that is [set aside to be] sent away is [left] to die [and] its blood is poured out. The two goats of Yom Kippur -- it is a mitzvah to draw lots for them. *Even if he did not draw lots for them (alt., "<i>before</i> he drew lots for them," see GR"A), he has the right to to change them for other things (i.e., other animals). A Passover offering that was not sacrificed on [Pesach] Rishon should be sacrificed on Sheni. [If] it was not sacrificed on Sheni, it should be sacrificed on Shelishi (see Tos. Pesachim 9:6). Money [that was not used to bring a] sacrifice on [Pesach] Rishon, should be [used to bring a] sacrifice on Sheni. [If] it was not [used to bring a] sacrifice on Sheni, it is [used to bring a] sacrifice on Shelishi. [If] it was not [used to bring a] sacrifice on Shelishi, it is [used to bring a] sacrifice on the next [pilgrimage festival (see Minchat Bikkurim)]. Goats of the pilgrimage festival (רגל) that were not sacrificed on [that] pilgrimage festival are sacrificed on Rosh Chodesh (the New Moon). [If] it was not sacrificed on Rosh Chodesh, it is sacrificed on Yom Kippur. [If] it was not sacrificed on Yom Kippur, it is sacrificed on the next pilgrimage festival (i.e., Sukkot), and from the start it was not consecrated to be a communal offering, rather [it was consecrated] on the condition that it would be brought on the outer Altar.
[If] the goat to be sent away died before the blood of the first [goat] was sprinkled, even though [the High Priest] did not confess on it, he fulfilled [his obligation], as it is said (Lev. 16:10): "[The goat ... shall be left] standing alive." Until when must it remain alive? Until he has finished the atonement of the Holy (see Lev. 16:20), the words of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says, until the time of the confession.
Rabbi Yosei says, this is what he says: "They have sinned, they have done wrong, they have transgressed before You, Your people the House of Israel." They make a ramp [to lead the goat down] because the people of Alexandria would pull on its hair, and they would say to him (i.e., the one assigned to accompany the goat), "Take it and leave, take it and leave!" The important people of Jerusalem would go with him until the first booth, for [there were] ten booths within twelve <i>mils</i> [from Jerusalem to the wilderness], the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says, there were nine booths within ten <i>mils</i>. Rabbi Yosei says, there were five booths within ten <i>mils</i>. They would make an eiruv from this one to that one. Said Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Yehuda, I could have done it with [only] two booths (see Yoma 67a:4).
They asked Rabbi Eliezer, "Behold, if the goat to be sent away became sick, what [is the halacha]? To carry it?" He said to them, "He (i.e., the goat) could carry others!" "[If] the one who sends it away became sick, what [is the halacha]? To have someone else send it away?" He said to them, "You and I shall be at peace." "[What if] he pushed it [down the cliff] and it didn't die? Should he descend after it and kill it?" He said to them, "Such should befall the enemies of the Place." [In this way, Rabbi Eliezer evaded each of their questions.] And the Sages say, a sick goat -- he may carry it. A sick sender -- [the goat is sent] through the agency of another. It fell and didn't die -- he descends after it and kills it.
The goat that is sent away -- even though it does not impart impurity on clothes, it does impart impurity on food and drink, the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, it does not impart impurity on food or drink, because it is alive, and a living thing does not impart impurity on food or drink. From what time does it impart impurity on clothes? From the time that it goes outside of the walls of Jerusalem, the words of Rabbi Meir. And Rabbi Yehuda says, from the time that it reaches the cliff. Rabbi Shimon says, from the time it is pushed off the cliff.
The bulls that are burnt -- even though they do not impart impurity on clothes, they do impart impurity on food and drink, the words of Rabbi Meir. And the goat that is sent away does not impart impurity on food and drink because he is alive and a living thing does not impart impurity on food or drink. From what time do they (i.e., the bulls) impart impurity on clothes? From the time that they go outside the walls of the Temple Courtyard, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says, from [the time it is placed on] the fire. Rabbi Shimon says, from the time that the fire has spread over most of them (i.e., most of their body).
Where do they burn them? In the large ash pit outside of Jerusalem, to the north of Jerusalem, outside of the three camps, and the guards of the Kohanim were stationed around the wood pile because the people would [try to] push through, so they wouldn't jump up to see [the burning] and fall inside the burning pyre. The clothes of both the one who conducts the burning, and the one who assists him are rendered impure, but the clothes of the one who sets up the wood pile and immediately (לאלתר) sets the fire are not rendered impure.
Eight blessings are recited on the same day (see Yoma 7:1): on the Torah, in the same way that they bless on the Torah in the synagogue; and on the [Temple] service; and on the Thanksgiving; and on the forgiveness for wrongdoing -- just like their order [in the synagogue]; and on the Temple, [which is] a blessing in and of itself; and on Israel, [which is] a blessing in and of itself; and on the Kohanim, [which is] a blessing in and of itself; and the remainder of the prayer, the supplication, and beseeching [God] that Your people Israel are in need of salvation, and he concludes it with "He Who hears Prayer." [Then] all the people read from their own [Torah scrolls (see Yoma 70a:8)], in order to show their beauty to the community.
Rabbi Eliezer says, this is the order that the sacrifices were brought: The [sacrifice of the] bull of the burnt offering and the goat were performed outside. They were sacrificed together with the morning Tamid. And after that the [sacrifice of the] bull and the goat were performed inside. And after that his ram (i.e., the ram of the Kohen Gadol) and the ram of the people. And after that the seven lambs without a blemish. Rabbi Akiva says, the bull of the burnt offering and the seven lambs without a blemish were sacrificed together with the morning Tamid, as it is said (Num. 25:23), "Aside from the burnt-offering of the morning that is offered up daily, etc." And after that, the [sacrifice of the] bull and the goat are performed inside. And after that, the [sacrifice of the] goat is performed outside, as it is said (Num. 29:11), "Aside from the sin-offering of the atonement ("HaKippurim") and the Tamid burnt-offering, and its grain-offering, and their libation-offerings. And after that his ram and the ram of the people. Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, one [lamb] was sacrificed together with the morning Tamid, and six were sacrificed together with the afternoon Tamid.
[The High Priest] would make a festival for his loved ones [when he departed in peace from the Holy of Holies] (Yoma 7:4). It so happened with Shimon ben Kamchit that he went out to speak with the king in the evening [after Yom Kippur had concluded], and spit sprayed from [the king's] mouth and fell on his clothes. His brother entered and performed the service of the High Priest in his stead. [And thus] their mother saw the two of them serving as High Priests on the same day.

Chapter 4

On Yom Kippur it is forbidden to eat, to wash, and to drink, and to anoint oneself, and to wear sandals, and to engage in intercourse (Yoma 8:1). Even an <i>anpileya</i> (a soft shoe) made of cloth [is forbidden]. Minors are permitted in all of these, but are forbidden from wearing sandals on account of its appearance.
Children who are close to maturity -- we educate them between one and two years [beforehand] so that they will become accustomed to [performing] the mitzvot. Rabbi Akiva would dismiss [his students from] the study hall for the sake of the children, so that their parents would feed them. It so happened with Shammai the Elder that he did not want to feed his son, and the Sages decreed that he feed him from his own hand.
One who eats on Yom Kippur the equivalent of a large date, like [the size of] it and like its pit that are in the Land of Israel is liable (see Yoma 8:2). Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, even the equivalent of [the size of] striped dates. [If] he ate the leaves of reeds, the leaves of grapevines, the leaves of fig trees, or the leaves of carob trees, and anything else that is not [considered] fit for eating, he is exempt. Leaves of lettuce, leaves of vetch, leaves of onions, leaves of vegetables, and anything else that is fit for eating -- he is liable.
He ate and returned and ate [again] -- if from the start of the first eating until the end of the last eating, there was enough [time] to eat half a loaf of bread, [the acts of eating] join together, and if not, they do not join together. He drank and returned and drank [again] -- if from the start of the first drinking until the end of the last drinking, there was enough [time] to drink a quarter-<i>log</i>, [the acts of drinking] join together, and if not, they do not join together. In the same way that an act of eating [requires] the equivalent of an olive's bulk, so too an act of drinking [requires] the equivalent of an olive's bulk. Acts of eating and drinking do not join together. One who drinks brine or fish stew is exempt. Rabbi Eliezer says, if he drank a mouthful, he is liable.
One who is seized with "bulmus" (see Yoma 8:6), they may feed him, starting from the most lenient. How so? If there was before him untithed produce and seventh year produce, they feed him seventh year produce. Untithed produce and carrion meat, they feed him carrion meat. Carrion meat and Terumah, they feed him Terumah. Terumah and seventh year produce, they feed him seventh year produce, until his eyes brighten. From whence do they know when his eyes brighten? When he can discern  the difference between good and bad. 
Rabbi Yehuda says, a pregnant woman who smells seventh-year produce [and craves it], they insert a reed [into it] for her [and she may eat the amount that is on the reed]. [Similarly, if] she smelled Terumah, they insert a reed for her. A person should not don a spiked shoe and walk around with it inside the house, even from bed to bed, but Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel permits it. And so too would Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel say, if his hands were filthy with mud or excrement, he may wash them in water so that his clothes will not get soiled. [And if] he was on his way to greet his father, or his Rabbi, or his student, he may pass in his customary way, even [if he must wade into water] up to his neck, and he need not be concerned.
Men and women who have experienced an abnormal discharge immerse on the night of Yom Kippur. The menstruants and those who have recently given birth immerse in their usual way on the night of Yom Kippur. Those who have had a seminal emission immerse in their usual way on the night of Yom Kippur. Rabbi Yosei son of Rabbi Yehuda says, from the camp and up, he does not immerse; rather, [he waits] until it becomes dark. Rabbi Yosei says, Kohanim immerse in their usual way with nightfall, so that they will be able to eat Terumah in the evening.
A sin offering and a definite guilt offering atone for what is written (i.e., robbery and misuse of Temple property). Death and Yom Kippur atone [when accompanied] with repentance. Repentance atones for minor violations of positive and negative commandments, except (Ex. 20:7) for "Do not take [the name of the Lord, your God, in vain]", and those which are severe violations [punishable by] excision and the death penalty by the Beit Din, and "Do not take" is among those. Rabbi Yehuda says, whoever [violates] "Do not take" and below (i.e., less severe transgressions) -- repentance effects atonement, and whoever [violates] "Do not take" and above (i.e., more severe transgressions) -- but "Do not take" is not among them -- repentance suspends [punishment] and Yom Kippur atones (Yoma 86a:2, Steinsaltz).
Rabbi Yishmael says, there are four distinctions of atonement. One who violates a positive commandment, and makes repentance, he does not [even] move from his place before he is pardoned, as it is said (Jer. 3:22, JPS Tr.), "Turn back, O rebellious children, I will heal your afflictions!" One who violates a negative commandment and makes repentance, the [act of] repentance suspends [judgment] and Yom Kippur pardons, as it is said (Lev. 16:30, JPS Tr.), "For on this day atonement shall be made for you, etc." One who willfully violates [a commandment punishable by] excision or the death penalty by the Beit Din, and makes repentance, repentance and Yom Kippur suspend [judgment] and the suffering he endures the rest of the year cleanses him, as it is said (Psalms 89:33, JPS Tr.), "I will punish their transgression with the rod [and their iniquity with plagues]." But whoever willfully desecrates the Name of Heaven and makes repentance, there is no power in that repentance to suspend [judgment], nor in Yom Kippur to effect atonement. Rather, repentance and Yom Kippur pardon a third, and his suffering pardons a third, and his death cleanses along with his suffering, and concerning that it is said (Is. 22:14, JPS Tr.), "This iniquity shall never be forgiven you until you die,” which teaches that the day of death cleanses.
A sin offering, a guilt offering, and death, and Yom Kippur -- none of them effect atonement except [when accompanied] with repentance, as it is said (Lev. 23:27), "But on the tenth day, etc." If he repents, he atones himself, and if not, he does not, he does not atone himself. Rabbi Eliezer says (Ex. 34:7), "and He cleanses" -- He cleanses those who repents, and He does not cleans those who do not repent. Rabbi Yehuda says, death and Yom Kippur atones with repentance, repentance atones with death, and the day of death -- behold, it is like repentance.
Whoever causes the [Jewish] community to be righteous (Avot 5:18), he is not given the opportunity to commit any wrongdoing, so he will not have students who inherit eternity, while he descends to Sheol, as it is said (Psalms 16:10, JPS Tr.), "For You will not abandon me to Sheol, etc." And anyone who causes the community to sin, he will not be given an opportunity to make repentance, so that he will not have students who descend to Sheol while he inherits eternity, as it is said (Prov. 28:17, JPS Tr.), "A man oppressed by bloodguilt [will flee into a pit]." Merit is brought about through the meritorious, [to be worthy] of meritorious portions. And liability is brought about through those who are liable, [to be worthy] of unmeritorious portions. 
They publicize one who profanes [God's name] because this is a desecration of the Name, as it is said (Ez. 3:20, JPS Tr.), "And if a righteous man abandons his righteousness and does wrong, when I put a stumbling block before him, he shall die." Thus, it is publicized. Rabbi Yosei says, if a man sins once, twice, or three times, they pardon him. Four -- they do not pardon him, as it is said (Ex. 24:7, see JPS Tr.), "forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin, and cleansing." Until that point, he is cleansed, from that point forward, he is not cleansed, as it is said (Amos 2:3, JPS Tr.), "For three transgressions of Israel, [(but) for four, I will not revoke it]." And it says (Job 33:29, JPS Tr.), "Truly, God does all these things, two or three times [to a man]." And it says (Prov. 25:17, JPS Tr.), "Visit your neighbor sparingly, etc."
The mitzvah of the viduy is on Yom HaKippurim with nightfall, but the sages said that a person does viduy [confesses] before they eat and drink lest they become distraught during eating and drinking. And even though one did viduy before eating and drinking, one [also] needs to do viduy after eating and drinking lest they did something disgraceful during the meal. And even though one did viduy after eating and drinking, one [also] needs to do viduy during the night service. And even though one did viduy during the night service, one [also] needs to do viduy during the morning  service. And even though one did viduy during the morning service, one [also] needs to do viduy during the musaf service. And even though one did viduy during the musaf  service, one [also] needs to do viduy during the afternoon service. And even though one did viduy during the afternoon service, one [also] needs to do viduy during the ne'ila service lest they did something disgraceful during the day [at any point].
At what point [in the Yom Kippur service] does he say [the confession]? After the tefillah (i.e., the Amidah), and the one who passes before the ark says it during the fourth [blessing]. Rabbi Meir says, he prays seven [blessings] and concludes with the confession, and the Sages say, he prays seven and if he wants to conclude with the confession, he concludes, and he needs to specify the sins [for which he seeks atonement], the words of Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira, as it is said (Ex. 32:31, JPS Tr.), "Alas, this people is guilty of a great sin [in making for themselves a god of gold]." Rabbi Akiva says, he does not need [to specify the sins]. In that case, why does it say, "in making for themselves a god of gold"? Rather, thus said the Place, "Who caused them to make themselves a god of gold? It is I, who gave them gold in abundance."
Matters upon which one confessed on the preceding Yom Kippur, there is no need to confess them on the next Yom Kippur. But if the things that he made [confession] over, he transgressed them [again], he needs to confess them [again]. [If] he did not transgress them [again], yet he confessed them, on such a person it is said (Prov. 26:11), "Like a dog that returns to its vomit [etc.]." Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says, behold, this is praiseworthy, as it is said (Psalms 51:5, JPS Tr.), "For I recognize my transgressions, etc." Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon says, there is a stringency with the goat [that is sent away] that there is not with Yom Kippur [itself], and with Yom Kippur that there is not with Yom Kippur -- that Yom Kippur effects atonement [even] without a goat, but the goat does not effect atonement except on Yom Kippur. The stringency of the goat is that the goat effects atonement immediately, but Yom Kippur [only effects atonement] upon nightfall.
