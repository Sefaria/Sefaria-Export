Tosefta Megillah



Chapter 1

Cities surrounded by a wall from the time of Joshua bin Nun read [the megillah] on the fifteenth [of Adar].  Rabbi Yehuda ben Karchah says "[walled] since the time of Achashverosh".  Rabbi Yose said in the name of Rabbi Yehudah, "Was Shushan the palace walled since the time of Joshua bin Nun?״  'Each family, each state, each city' (Esther 9:28): Towns that are near the city and seem part of it are treated like it [with respect to reading the megillah on the 15th of Adar].
Those who go out in a caravan and those who travel on a ship read [the megillah] on the fourteenth [of Adar].  If [the fourteenth] falls on Friday, walled cities move the reading earlier to the day of gathering [Thursday] and large unwalled cities read on that day [Friday].  Rabbi Yose said "I say that inhabitants of walled cities should not read before the inhabitants of large unwalled cities, but should read on the same day as them, on that day [Friday]."  If [the fourteenth] falls on Shabbat, small towns move the reading earlier to the day of gathering [Thursday] and large unwalled cities read on Friday and walled cities on Sunday.  Rabbi [Yehuda Hanasi] said "I say that since the large unwalled cities have been moved from the appropriate day, they should be moved all the way up to the day of gathering [Thursday]."
Rabbi Yehudah said, "When [does the reading get moved up to the day of gathering]?  In a place that people gather on Monday and Thursday.  But in a place where people do not gather on Monday and Thursday, since people look at it [to determine when Pesach should start], they should look at it [read it] in its appropriate time." 
The reading of the megillah and the donation of shekels can be moved earlier but not moved later.  Uncertain [date of] circumcision, the time of the donation of wood for the alter, the 9th of Av, the hagigah offering, and hakhel can be moved later but not earlier.  Even though they said that megillah reading is moved earlier and not later, the megillah is read and [gifts for the needy] are collected and distributed on that day [the fourteenth] because the poor are look forward to the scheduled day of megillah reading, as it says (Esther 9:28) "These days will be remembered and practiced..." to fulfill the happiness in the appropriate time.
The collection of Purim is designated for Purim and the collection of a city is designated for that city.  One is not frugal with the collection of Purim, rather we buy with it calves and slaughter and eat them.  The extra money should (not) be added to the general charity fund.  Rabbi Akiva said "The collection of Purim should not be used to buy a shoe lace for a poor person."
Rabbi Meir said "One who borrows money from one's fellow to buy fruit should not use it to buy vessels; [...] to buy vessels should not use that it to buy fruit since she steals the mind of [misleads] the lender."  Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Meir "One who borrows money from one's fellow to buy a shirt should not use it to buy a cloak; [...] to buy a cloak should not use it to buy a shirt since she misleads the lender.
If they read the megillah in Adar I and the year was intercalated, they must read it in Adar II because all the mitzvot that are performed in Adar II are performed in Adar I.  R' Akiva said in the name of R' Yose in the name of R' Zecharya ben Hakatzav "They need not read it in Adar II because all the mitzvot that are performed in Adar II are not performed in Adar I except for [the restrictions on] eulogy and fasting that are performed in both."  Contracts in each month: In [Adar] I, we write "Adar" and in Adar II, it is written "Tinyan [Two]".
There is no difference between a holiday and Shabbat except for [work pertaining to preparation of] food.  R' Yehuda said "also [work pertaining to] allowing for [preparation of] food.  R' Nechunya ben Hakana said "Yom Kippur is like Shabbat with respect to payment for civil damages."  There is no difference between the second set of three fasts and the last set of seven fasts except for blowing [the shofar] and closing the markets.  There is no difference between one who swears off benefit from his fellow and one who swears off food from his fellow except for walking through the others' property and implements that are not used for food.
There is no difference between a generic nazir [i.e., one who did not specify a time frame and defaults to thirty day period] and a thirty day nazir [i.e., one who explicitly specified a thirty day period] except that a generic nazir shaves on the thirty first day, and if he shaved on the thirtieth, his vow was not fulfilled, whereas the thirty day nazir shaves on the thirty first day and if he shaved on the thirtieth, his vow is fulfilled.  For both of them, the ideal is to shave on the thirty first day.  There is no difference between the blood of a corpse and a mixture of blood from a live person and from a dead person except that the blood of a corpse causes a nazir to shave [i.e., breaks the nazirite vow] and one is liable for contaminating the temple and holy things, whereas the blood mixture does not cause a nazir to shave and one is not liable for contaminating the temple and holy things.  
There is no difference between an olive-sized piece of a corpse and an entire corpse except that the [tumah associated with the] piece of a corpse [exits through] an opening the size of a handbreadth, whereas the [tumah associated with the] entire corpse [exits through] an opening the size of four handbreadths.  There is no difference between a olive-sized piece of a corpse and a piece of a bone larger than a barley seed except for the propensity to contaminate other things in a closed space [which a bone does not have].  There is no difference between a limb taken from a corpse and a limb taken from a living person except that flesh from a limb taken from a corpse is tamei and flesh from a limb taken from a live person is tahor. 
There is no difference between a one who sees two unnatural discharges and one who sees three except for the obligation to bring a sacrifice.  There is no difference between a male and a female who have unnatural discharges except that the male must immerse in living waters, whereas a female doesn't need to immerse in living waters.  There is no difference between a female with an unnatural discharge and a menstruating female except for the bringing of an offering [which the menstruant does not have to do]. There is no difference between the sacrifice of the woman who has an unnatural discharge and one who has given birth except for the type of offering (?).  There is no difference between a menstruating woman and one who is waiting one day after one day of abnormal discharge except for the counting of seven days. 
There is no difference between a house quarantined [for suspicion of tzaraat] and a house that has been declared [to contain tzaraat] except that the quarantined house makes things inside it tamei and the declared house makes things inside it and things behind it tamei.  And both cause tuma through entrance.  Stones that have tzaraat cause tuma behind them. There is no difference between vows and dedications except that one who vows to consecrate something for the use of the Temple must replace it if it is lost, whereas one who dedicates something and uses it only has to pay for the benefit of the usage.
There is no difference between a private altar and a public altar except that only vows and dedications may be brought on a private altar, whereas any offering that is not a result of a vow or a dedication may be brought on a public altar.  There is no difference between the sanctuary in Shilo and the Temple in Jerusalem except that in Shilo, the building was made of stone on the bottom and curtains above.
There is no difference between a currently serving high priest consecrated through anointing and a former high priest except for [the current can perform] the bull of Yom Kippur and the tenth of an eipha [daily offering]. ... 

Chapter 2

One who reads the Megillah out of order does not fill [his obligation], and so too with Hallel and so too with <i>tefillah</i> (i.e., the Amidah), and so too with the recitation of the Shema. [If] the [public] reader of the Megillah errors or skips over one of its verses, he does not go back and read the verse by itself, but he begins from the same verse and continues until the very end [of the Megillah], and so too with Hallel, and so too with <i>tefillah</i>, and so too with the recitation of the Shema. One who enters the synagogue and found that they had [already] read half [of the Megillah], and he finishes with them, he does not go back and read it from the beginning until the place [where they were when he arrived], but rather he starts from the beginning and continues until the very end, and so too with Hallel, and so too with <i>tefillah</i>, and so too with the recitation of the Shema.
One who read [the Megillah] at night did not fulfill his obligation. Said Rabbi Yosei, it so happened with Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri that he read [the Megillah] in Sepphoris at night. They said to him, a time of danger (i.e., of persecution) is not a proof. One who recited [the Megillah] by memory did not fulfill his obligation. Said Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, it so happened with Rabbi Meir that he went to Asia Minor to pass the year and he did not find a  Megillah there written in Hebrew. So he wrote it from memory and he went back and read from it. One who read [the Megillah], whether standing, whether sitting, whether lying down, whether he appointed a[n Aramaic] translator, whether he made a blessing before [reading] it, or whether he made a blessing afterwards, [or whether he made a blessing] afterwards and did not make a blessing beforehand, or whether he did not make a blessing either beforehand or afterwards -- he has fulfilled [his obligation]. Said Rabbi Shimon, it so happened with Rabbi Meir that he read [the Megillah] in the synagogue in Tibin sitting down, and the congregation was sitting down, and as soon as he finished part of it, he gave it to someone else and he (i.e., the other person) blessed over it.
[If the Megillah] was read in a foreign language (specifically Greek, see Jastrow (לעז)), the foreign-speakers fulfilled their obligation. [If] it was read in Assyrian, those that heard it and those that did not hear it fulfilled their obligation. In any case, they do not fulfill their obligation unless it is written in Assyrian with Hebrew letters on a scroll, and with ink.
Everyone is liable in reading the Megillah -- Kohanim, Levites, and Israelites, and freed slaves, disqualified [Kohanim], Netinim (i.e., descendants of Gibeonites), and <i>mamzerim</i>, eunuchs, those born sexually impotent, one wounded with crushed or severed testicles (=פצוע דכא וכרות שפכה, see Deut. 23:2), all of them are liable, and can cause others to fulfill their obligations. A hermaphrodite fulfills the obligations of his (or her) gender but not of those that are not of his (or her) gender. One who is half slave and half freedman does not cause those that are of his gender or not of his gender to fulfill their obligation. Women and slaves and minors are exempt and they do not cause others to fulfill their obligation. Said Rabbi Yehuda, when I was a child I read [the Megillah] in front of Rabbi Tarfon in Lod and he praised me. Said Rebbi, when I was a child I read [the Megillah] in front of Rabbi Yehuda in Usha, and there were elders there, and none of them said a word. They said to him, one cannot bring a proof from one (i.e., such as Rabbi Yehuda), who permitted that very thing to be done. [Nevertheless,] from that time and onward, they became accustomed to permit minors to read [the Megillah] in public.
The obligation of the Megillah [is to read it] from the beginning until the end, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says, from [the words] "A Jewish man" (Esther 2:5). Rabbi Yosei says, from [the words], "After these events" (Esther 3:1). Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, from "That night" (Esther 6:1). But all agree that [regardless of the point at which one started], the obligation is to complete [the Megillah] until the very end.
All of the day of the waving (i.e., the first day of the Omer, see Suk. 3:12), it is forbidden to eat new grain.  All of the seventh day [of Sukkot] one is obligated in sukkah, and all of the seventh day [of Sukkot] is valid for [waving] the lulav.  All of the eighth day [after birth] is valid for circumcision.  All of the night is valid for the reaping of the omer and for the burning of limbs and fat [leftover from the day's sacrifices].  The general principle is that anything commanded during the day is valid all day and anything commanded at night is valid all night.  One is not liable for notar [leaving part of the shelamim sacrifice over] and the intention [at the time of the sacrifice to eat the shelamim sacrifice later] does not invalidate as pigul until dawn.
Rabbi Menachem son of Rabbi Yosei says, members of the congregation should not buy a town square [to use for public worship, cf. Meg. 3:1]. Said Rabbi Yehuda, to what case does this apply? To a situation where they did not make a stipulation to the leaders of the city, but if they made a stipulation to the leaders of the city, then the trustees of the charitable fund [may use the money to purchase] whatever thing they desire.
One who fashions an ark [to house the Torah] or wrappings for a [Torah] scroll -- as long as they were not yet used for a sacred purpose, they may be used for a profane purpose, but if they had been used for a sacred purpose, they may not be used for a profane purpose. And [similarly], utensils that had been used for a sacred purpose may not be used for a profane purpose, but a person may lend his wrapping for use on a scroll, and he returns it, and he takes it from him (presumably, to use for his own purposes). A wrapping for a scroll may be changed from one scroll to another scroll, but not to anything else.
One who makes a candelabra or a lamp for a synagogue -- before its owner's name has been forgotten (i.e., when people still remember that he donated the item (see Arakhin 6b:3, Steinsaltz)), it is permitted to change it [for a different purpose]. Once his name has been forgotten, it is not permitted to change it [for a different purpose]. An individual that pledges charity in his city must give it to the poor of his city; [if he pledged it] to another town, he gives it to the poor of the other town. The administrators of charity who apportion charity in their city must give it to the poor of their city; [if they apportion it] to another city, they must give it to the poor of the other city. One who pledges charity, before the administrators of charity have taken possession, he is permitted to change [his pledge] to another thing. Once the administrators of charity have taken possession, he is not permitted to change [his pledge] to another thing without their consent.
[If] a Gentile dedicated a [cross-]beam to a synagogue, and there was written on it, "To the Name," we examine him [as to what is intended by the inscription]. If he said, I vowed it "To the Holy Name," we bury it, and if he said, I vowed it "To the Name of the Synagogue," we cut off the place [with the inscription of] "The Name" and bury that part, and it is permitted to use [the remainder]. [If the Gentile dedicated] sacred objects -- before they are used for a sacred purpose, they may be used for a non-sacred purpose, and objects that were used from the start for non-sacred purposes, we may not use them for sacred purposes. Stones and beams which were hewn from the start for an ordinary purpose may not be used to build on the Temple Mount. Stones [that had been used] for the Sanctuary or for the Temple Courtyard, which were damaged [during the destruction of the Temple], cannot be redeemed and must be buried. Said Rabbi Yehuda, it so happened with Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Tzadok that he bought the Synagogue [built by] Alexandrians in Jerusalem (see Jastrow re: "אֲלֶכְסַנְדְּרִי"), and he did what he wanted with it. They did not prohibit using it except during the time that it was still called by its original name.
[With respect to] synagogues, one may not behave frivolously (lit. "light-headed") in them. One may not bring an animal inside them in summer due to the heat, in winter due to the cold, or in the rainy season due to the rains, nor may one eat in them, nor drink in them, nor sleep in them, nor wander around in them, nor adorn oneself in them. Rather, one may read [the Torah], or study the oral law, or give sermons in them. Public eulogies may be eulogized in them. Said Rabbi Yehuda, in what case does this apply? When they are occupied [by congregants]. But when they are in a state of ruin, we leave them alone and let grass grow up in them, due to the anguish of the soul [that they cause to those who see them in disrepair].

Chapter 3

[When] Rosh Chodesh Adar falls on Shabbat, we read the portion of <i>"Shekalim"</i> (Ex. 30:11-16) and in addition we read the portion of the <i>shekalim</i> that concerns Yehoyada the Kohen (commencing with 2 Kings 12:8). What is the "first Shabbat"? Any Rosh Chodesh Adar falls within [that designation], even on Erev Shabbat. On the second Shabbat, [we read the portion beginning] "Remember [what Amalek did]" (Deut. 25:17) and additionally we read "Thus said the Lord of Hosts, I remember what Amelek did to Israel" (1 Sam. 15:2). What is the "second Shabbat"? Every [Shabbat] in which Purim falls within it, and even on Erev Shabbat. On the third [Sabbath we read the portion of] the Red Heifer, and additionally we read "And I will sprinkle pure water on you and you will be purified" (Ezek. 36:25). What is the "third Shabbat"? Any [Shabbat] that immediately follows Purim. The fourth [Shabbat we read], "This month shall be to you the head of the months" (Ex. 12:2), and in addition [we read] "Thus said the Lord, in the first [month], on the first of the month" (Ezek. 45:18). Which is the fourth Shabbat? Any [Shabbat] in which Rosh Chodesh Nissan falls within it, and even on Erev Shabbat.
[If] the portion of the <i>Shekalim</i> fell [as part of the normal cycle] next to Adar, either before it or after it, we read it [at its normal time] and then we read it a second time [for purposes of Purim], and so two for the second [portion], and so too for the third, and so too for the fourth. And so too for Chanukah (בחנוכה not בפורים). They ask about the halachot of Passover on Passover, and the halachot of Shevuot on Shevuot, and the halachot of Sukkot on Sukkot. In the study hall they ask about the halachot of Passover thirty days before Passover. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, two weeks.
On the first Yom Tov of Passover we read the section (Lev. 23) on "waving" that is in Torat Kohanim (i.e., Leviticus), and the remainder of all the days of Passover, we skip to other subjects [involving] Passover that are written in the Torah. On Shavuot [we read the section beginning with] "Seven weeks" (Deut. 16:9) and there are those that say [we read the passage beginning] "In the third month" (Ex. 19:1). On Rosh Hashanah [we read the passage beginning] "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, On the seventh month, on the first of the month, etc." (Lev. 23:24), and there are those that say [we read the passage beginning] "And the Lord remembered Sarah" (Gen. 21:1). On Yom Kippur we read "After the death" (Lev. 16:1), and we add "On the tenth" (Num. 28:12), which is in the Book of Numbers (see also Yoma 7:1). On the first Yom Tov of Sukkot (lit., "Festival") we read [the passage beginning] "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the Festival of Sukkot, etc." (Lev. 23:34), and on the second day [we begin with] "On the second day," on the third [we begin with] "On the third day," on the fourth [we bigin with] "And on the fourth], on the fifth [we begin with] "And on the fifth," on the sixth [we begin with] "And on the sixth," on the seventh [we begin with] "And on the seventh," and on the eighth [we begin with] "And on the eighth" (see Num. 29).
On a Rosh Chodesh that falls on Chanukah, we read (Num. 28:11), "And on the first of your months [etc.]." At the place that they leave off [the Torah reading] in the morning service on Shabbat, they begin from that point in the afternoon service.  [Where they leave off] in the afternoon service, they begin from that point on Monday, [and from where they leave off] on Monday, they begin from point on Thursday, [and from where they leave off] on Thursday, they begin from that point on the next Shabbat. Rabbi Yehuda says, at the place where they leave off [the Torah reading] in the morning service on Shabbat, they begin from there on the next Shabbat.
On Yom Tov five [read from the Torah], on Yom Kippur six, and on Shabbat seven. If they wanted to add, they may not add, the words of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says, on Yom Tov five, on Yom Kippur six, and on Shabbat seven, and if they wanted to add, they may add. Everyone counts toward the quorum of seven [readers], even a woman, even a minor. [However,] we do not bring up a woman to read before the masses.
A synagogue that only has one person who is able to read [from the Torah], he stands and reads and sits [during the <i>aliyahs</i>] even seven times. A synagogue where a foreign tongue is spoken, if they have someone who is able to read Hebrew, they should [at least] begin in Hebrew and conclude [in Hebrew]. If they have no one who is able to read [in Hebrew] except for one, then only that one person should read.
They do not make fewer than seven stops during funeral processions, and they do not say the blessing for mourners with less than ten [present] (Meg. 4:3). And they do not [perform the custom of] standing [and sitting during the delivery of eulogies] with less than ten, and mourners do not count as part of the minyan. We do not say the blessing of the bridegrooms with less than ten, and the bridegroom is part of the minyan. The blessing of the bridegroom may be said either at the engagement meal or at the wedding meal, either on a weekday or on Shabbat. Rabbi Yehuda says, if new people came, we may say the blessing of the bridegroom, and if not, we may not say the blessing of the bridegroom.
When would they light the torches (מַשִּׂיאִין not מסיעין)? It was on the evening of the additional day (see Rosh Hashanah 22b:15). How would they do it? If it fell on Erev Shabbat or Shabbat, they light the torches on behalf [of the new month] after Shabbat. Said Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Tzadok, this is how the fellowship that was in Jerusalem conducted itself: Some went to a house of feasting, and others to a house of mourning, and others to a betrothal feast, and others to a wedding feast, [and] others to the "week of the son" (i.e., the circumcision ceremony), and others to the "gathering of bones" (i.e., the ritual of transporting the deceased to a permanent burial site, see Pes. 92a:1). [With respect to] the week of the son and the gathering of bones, the week of the son takes precedence to the gathering of bones. [With respect to] the house of feasting and the house of mourning, the house of feasting takes precedence over the house of mourning. Rabbi Yishmael would give precedence to the house of mourning over everything else, as it says (Ecc. 7:2), "It is better to go to a house of mourning [than to go to a house of feasting]." Rabbi Meir says in the name of Rabbi Akiva, what do we learn from "and the living will place it in his heart (ibid.)"? Perform [an act of kindness] and they will perform it for you; accompany [the dead] so they will accompany you; eulogize, so they will eulogize you; and bury, so they will bury you.
We do not read fewer than three verses from the Torah at one time.  If there was a section with four [verses] or of five [verses] (i.e., which cannot be divided into two or more sections of three), behold, one person reads the whole thing. [If] there was a section of five and he read three and left out the other two, the one who stands up to read after him reads those two and another three from a different section. If there was a section of four or five [verses], behold, he reads everything. We may not read an additional [portion from the] Prophets (i.e., the <i>haftarah</i>) of less than three verses at one time. If there was a section of four or five verses, behold, he reads everything. One who cuts short [the reading], behold he is praised. If it was a short section, such as (Is. 42:3), "For thus says the Lord, you were sold for nothing, and you shall be redeemed without money," it is read by itself.
They may only let there remain at the end of the scroll enough [verses] that seven may read. If they only let there remain enough for six to read, then six read them, and another seven read from a different <i>chumash</i>. They may only let there remain at the end of the Torah [portion] enough that seven may read. If they only let there remain enough for six to read, then six read them, and then they go back to the beginning [of the Torah read] and seven read them.
We may skip [from one place to another] in the Prophets, but we may not skip in the Torah, and we may not skip from [one] Prophet to [a different] Prophet. [However,] we may skip from one of the twelve [minor prophets to another], as long as one does not skip from the end of the book to its beginning.
We wrap a Torah [scroll] with Torah wrapping-cloths, and the five books of the Torah (i.e., if in individual scrolls) with wrapping clothes for [individual scrolls of] the five books. [We may wrap a scroll of the] Torah or [of one of] the five books with a  wrapping-cloth of the Prophets, but not the Prophets with a wrapping-cloth of the Torah or [of one of] the five books. And we may place a Torah on top of [another] Torah, and [we may place one of] the five books on top of [another one of] the five books, [and we may place a] Torah or [one of] the five books on top of the Prophets, but not the Prophets on top of the Torah or [one of] the five books.
One person [publicly] reads the [weekly portion of the] Torah and one translates. There should not be one who reads and two who translate, and not two who read and one who translates, and not two who read and two who translate. One person reads the Prophets (i.e., the <i>haftarah</i>) and one translates, [or] one reads and two translate, but there should not be two who read and one who translates, and not two who read and two who translate. One person reads the Megillah and one translates, [or] one reads and two translate, [or] two read and one translates, [or] two read and two translate. A minor [may] translate under the supervision of an adult, but it is undignified for an adult to translate under the supervision of a minor, as it says (Ex. 7:2), "And Aaron your brother will be a prophet to you." The prayer-leader of the congregation shall not [lead the] prayers until others urge him to do so, and even the head of the congregation shall not [lead the] prayers until others urge him to do so, as no one should take something for himself (i.e., the performance of a mitzvah to which others may be entitled, see Minchat Bikkurim here) with his own hands. 
How would the elders sit? They would face the congregation and have their backs to the Holy. When they set down the Ark, [the elders] would face the people with their backs to the Holy. When the Kohanim lifted their hands, they would face the people with their backs to Holy. The prayer-leader of the congregation faces the Holy and all the people face the the Holy, as it says (Lev. 8:4), "And the assembly was gathered at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting." We do not open an entryway to a synagogue except toward the east, as it says (Num. 3:38), "Those who camp before the Tabernacle, to the east, before the Tent of Meeting, to the west." We do not build [a synagogue] except at the highest point of the city, as it says (Prov. 1:21), "At the head of the thoroughfare she (i.e., Wisdom) calls."
[Continuing on the theme of respect for elders,] what is the "rising" (<i>kimah</i>) of which the Torah spoke (Lev. 19:32), "Before the elderly you shall 'rise' (<i>takum</i>)"? [It means that one should] rise before [the elderly who are] within four <i>amot</i>. What is the "deference" (<i>ha'dor</i>) of which the Torah spoke (ibid.), "...and show 'deference' (<i>v'hadarta</i>) before the aged ones"? [It means that one does] not stand in his place (i.e., the place where the aged one normally stands), and does not speak in his place, and does not contradict his words. [Rather,] treat him with reverence and fear, whether in business dealings, when you enter [a place], and when you leave [a place]. And they take precedence over every person, as it is says (Deut. 1:15), "And I appointed them (i.e., wise and knowledgeable men) as leaders over you." § [Related to matters of respect,] one who goes out to war should dig a hole [to defecate in], and turn one's back, and cover it up, as it says (Deut. 23:14), "and you shall dig with it (i.e., with a spade), and you shall turn your back [to defecate], etc." One who relieves himself (="המסיך את רגליו", see Judges 3:24) faces the people, and one who urinates does so with his back to the Holy. Said Rabbi Yosei, to what case does this refer?  From [Mount] Scopus and closer [to the Temple], but from [Mount] Scopus and further, there is no need.
One who leads the responsive recitation of the Shema, or blesses over fruit or over matzah, behold, he should not answer "amen" after himself.  If he answered ["amen" after his own prayer], behold, this is how ignoramuses act.  We do not answer with either an "orphaned amen" (i.e., where one does not know to what blessing he is saying "amen"), or a "truncated [amen]" (i.e., where one does not pronounce the entire word). Ben Azzai says, one who answers with an "orphaned amen" -- his children will be orphaned; with a "truncated [amen]," his days will be truncated. But whoever prolongs [his amen], his days and years will be prolonged.
A person in rags may lead the responsive reading of the Shema, and may translate [the Torah reading into Aramaic] (Meg. 4:6). Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, he should be careful that he does not expose himself. A blind man may lead the responsive reading of the Shema and may translate. Rabbi Yehuda says, anyone who never saw light in all his days may not lead the responsive reading of the Shema. They said to him, many [Sages] have expounded upon the Divine Chariot (Ezek. 1) even though they never saw it. A Kohen that has a [disqualifying] blemish on his face, on his hands, or on his feet, behold, he may not lift up his hands [for the Priestly Blessing] because the people will look at him. But if there was a quorum of ten (<i>chaver ir</i>, see Ber. 4:7), behold, it is permitted. Behold, if he had on an <i>otef</i> (a type of cloak), or a smock, or a traveling cloak, he has no dignity such as to read [from the Torah]] or translate or pass before the Ark, or to lift his hands [for the Priestly Blessing].
One who affixes his mezuzah inside the entrance [to his house, rather than on the doorpost] is in danger and has not fulfilled the commandment. [If] he placed it on a stick or affixed it behind the door, he is in danger and has not fulfilled the commandment. In the house of King Mumbaz (alt. "Mulbaz," see Lieberman), there were innkeepers who did so.
There are [scriptural passages] that are [publicly] read and translated [orally into Aramaic during the public reading], [others] that are read but are not translated, [and others] that are neither read nor translated. The account of creation (Gen. 1), we read and translate. The account of Lot and his two daughters (Gen. 19) is read and translated. The account of Judah and Tamar (Gen. 38) is read and translated. The *first account of the [Golden] Calf is read and translated. [Note: The "first" account refers to the Torah's initial narrative of the sin of the Golden Calf, Ex. 31:1-20 (see Meg. 4:10).] The curses that are in the Torah are read and translated, but we may not permit one [reader] to start and another [reader] to finish, rather the one who starts is the one who finishes. The warnings and punishments that are in the Torah are read and translated. The account of Amnon and and Tamar (2 Sam. 13) is read and translated. The account of Absalom and his father's concubines (2 Sam. 15:16, 16:22) is read and translated. The account of the concubine of Gibeah (Judges 19-21) is read and translated. [The passage commencing with] "Proclaim to Jerusalem [her abominations (<i>to'avoteha</i>)]" (Ezek. 16:2) is read and translated. And it so happened that someone was reading before Rabbi Eliezer "Proclaim to Jerusalem [etc.]" and he translated it. [Rabbi Eliezer] said to him, "Go and proclaim the abominations (<i>to'avoteha</i>) of your mother!" The Divine Chariot (Ezek. 1), we read it to the masses. The incident of Reuben [and Bilhah] is read but not translated. And it so happened with Rabbi Chananiah ben Gamaliel that he was reading in Akko, "And Reuben went and he lay with Bilhah, etc., and the sons of Jacob were twelve" (Gen. 35:22*), and he told the translator, do not translate this except for the end. [*Note: The reference in the Hebrew text to Gen. 25:16 (בראשית כ״ה:ט״ז) appears erroneous.] The second account of the [Golden] Calf, from "And Moses said to Aaron, What did this people do to you?" until "And Moses saw that the people had become unrestrained" (Ex. 32:21-25), and also what is written after, "And God plagued the people, etc." (Ex. 32:35), from this said Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, a person should not recount a disgraceful event, is it was due to Aaron's recounting to Moses that the apostates rebelled (i.e., Aaron's statement, "I threw [the gold] into the fire, and this calf emerged," appeared to acknowledge that the calf possessed divine power, see Meg. 25b:12 (Steinsaltz)). The account of David and Bathsheba is neither read nor translated. But the [Bible] teacher teaches [these passages] in his usual way.
All the verses in the Torah which are written in obscene language are read in refined language, such as (Deut. 28:30), [which is written,] "You will betroth a woman, but another man will <i>yishgalenah</i> ('ravish her)," in every place where it is written <i>yishgalenah</i>, we read it as <i>yishkavenah</i> ("lie with her"); and such as (Deut. 28:27), [which is written,] "[God will strike you] with the boils of Egypt and with <i>afolim</i> ('hemmerhoids')," in every place where it is written <i>afolim</i>, we read it as <i>tehorim</i> ("tumors"); and such as (2 Kings 6:25-26), "a quarter of a kav of doves' <i>divyonim</i> ('excrement', considered softer than <i>chiryonim</i>, 'dung', as written) sold for five shekels," [and] (Is. 36:12), "to eat <i>tzo'atam</i> ('their own excrement', considered softer than <i>chareichem</i>, 'their own dung', as written) and drink their urine," [and] (2 Kings 10:27), "and they turned it (i.e., the temple of Ba'al) into <i>motzaot</i> ('latrines,' considered softer than <i>chara'ot</i>, 'outhouses', as written) until today."  Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karcha says, [with respect to the last example,] "and they turned it into <i>chara'ot</i> (per GR"A)," we read it as it is written because the thing itself (i.e., the temple of Ba'al) is obscene.
[If] a passage is written in the singular, we *may change it to the plural (*alt., "do not," per GR"A). [If] in the plural, we do not change it to the singular. Rabbi Yehuda says, one who translates a verse  literally, behold, he is a liar, and one who adds [to what is written], behold, he is blasphemer. The interpreter who stands in front of a Sage [and transmits his teachings] is not permitted either to shorten or lengthen or change [what the Sage said], unless he is his father or his teacher.
