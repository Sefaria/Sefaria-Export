Tosefta Ta'anit



Chapter 1

We ask for the rains until Nissan is over, as it says, "And rain will fall for you, the earlier and latter rains during the first [month] (Yoel 2);" [these are] the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say,"Earlier rains [fall in] Marcheshvan, and latter rains [fall on] the first of Nissan (and so these dates are the timetable for prayers for rain). Rabbi Meir said to them, "Knowing that a tree makes fruit for twelve [months], and produce [grows] for six months; what have we found with trees, as it says [about it], "By its month (meaning halfway through the month), it will bear (Yechezkel 47)," so too produce, at its fifteenth day [its season ends]. Haven't you learnt, that earlier and latter rains [fall throughout] Nissan.
From when do we start asking for rains? From when the time of the rains comes. If it was a lacking year (meaning, a year with 353 days as opposed to 354), we give it its lack (the extra day it should have had). If not, it goes according to its set schedule: [All of this goes by] the words of Rabbi [Yehudah haNasi]. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, "Actually, they go according to their set schedule [all the time]." If it was a leap year, we give it its extra. 
What is considered the first rain (heb. R'viah)? [Rabbi Meir says, "An early one (lit. a firstborn) [falls] by the third [of Marcheshvan]; a middle one [falls] by the seventh; [and] a late one (lit. a dark one) [falls] by the seventeenth." Rabbi Yehudah says, "An early one [falls] by the seventh; a middle one [falls] by the seventeenth; [and] a late one [falls] by the twenty-third." Rabbi Yose says, An early one [falls] by the seventeenth; a middle one [falls] by the twenty-third; [and] a late one [falls] by Rosh Chodesh Kislev."] And so, Rabbi Yose would say, "The individuals do not fast until Rosh Chodesh Kislev."

Chapter 2



Chapter 3






[On] those days (of the wood offerings) it is forbidden regarding eulogizing [and fasting, (both) whether when the Temple was destroyed or when the Temple was not destroyed]. Rabbi Yosi says: when the Temple was destroyed we permit it because one is mourning for them. Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok said: I was among the descendants of S'nav, the son of Benjamin, and when Tisha B'Av fell on Shabbat and we delayed it until after Shabbat we would fast, but not complete [it].






The same days [that now are fast days] will in the future be festive days for Israel, as it is said (Zech. 8:19), "Thus said God, the fast of the fourth month, etc., [will be for joy and happiness and cheerful festivals for the House of Judah]," and all who mourn for her (i.e., Jerusalem) in this world will be joyful in the world to come, as it is said (Is. 66:10), "Rejoice with Jerusalem and be gladdened with her, all those who love her, etc."
