Chapter 5



Chapter 6









He who delivers a divorce document to his wife and says to him [the messenger], "Do not give it to her except after three months. Once the divorce document reaches her, she is permitted to marry immediately, and there is no concern that it is an old divorce document. This applies to the daughter of a priest who married an Israelite and her husband died. She can eat terumah that evening, and there is no concern that she is pregnant.

Chapter 7



Chapter 8

A boy of nine years and one day [who is an] Ammonite or a Moabite, an Egyptian or an Edomite or an an idolater, a Nitin or a <i>mamzer</i> who engaged in relations with the daughter of a Kohen or the daughter of a Levite or the daughter of an Israelite -- she is disqualified from [marriage into] the priesthood. Rabbi Yosei says, whoever's offspring is fit, she herself is fit; whoever's offspring is disqualified, she herself is disqualified. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, anyone whose daughter is permitted to you in marriage, his widow is permitted to you in marriage, and anyone whose daughter is not permitted to you in marriage, his widows is not permitted to you in marriage. A Levitess whose daughter is taken captive -- she is fit to the priesthood. Levites [whose genealogy may have been] compromised by their mothers -- the Sages did not suspect them. A Levitess who was taken captive, or who engaged in sexual relations with a man to whom she is forbidden -- they take away the tithe from her. The daughter of a Levite who is born of a female Nitin or a female <i>mamzer</i> -- they do not take away the tithe from her. An ordinary Kohen who married an <i>aylonit</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., a female of 20 years or older who has not gone through puberty and is considered barren (see Nid. 5:9)</i> -- behold, she may eat Terumah. A Kohen Gadol should not marry a woman he raped or seduced, but he may marry a minor who refused her husband. A Kohen Gadol whose brother died must perform <i>halitza</i>, but if there are other brothers, he does not perform <i>halitza</i>. For what reason did they say (see Yev. 6:4) that a Kohen Gadol who performed <i>ma'amar</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the rabbinically ordained betrothal preceding a levirate marriage</i> with the former wife of his deceased brother [before he was appointed Kohen Gadol] shall not bring her into marriage? Because the acquisition effected by <i>ma'amer</i> is not a complete acquisition.
A man should not desist from [fulfilling the commandment of] "be fruitful and multiply" unless he has sons. Grandsons -- behold, they  are [considered to be] like sons. If one of them died, or if one of them became castrated, he is not permitted to desist. A man is not permitted to abide without a wife, but a woman is permitted to abide without a husband. A man is not permitted to drink a [sterilizing] root drink in order that he not bear children, but a woman is permitted to drink a root drink in order that she not bear children.
A man is not permitted to marry a barren or elderly woman, an <i>aylonit</i>, a minor, or one who is not fit to bear children, but a woman is permitted to marry even a eunuch. Rabbi Yehuda says, one who castrates a male is liable, but [one who sterilizes] a female is exempt. Rabbi Natan said: Beit Shammai say two boys [are required to fulfill the commandment of "be fruitful and multiply"], like Moshe’s sons, as it is written: “And Moshe’s sons were Gershom and Elazar" (Chronicles 1 23:15). Beit Hillel say: a son and a daughter, as it is written: “Male and female God created them” (Genesis 5:2). Rabbi Natan said: Beit Shammai say: a son and a daughter, and Beit Hillel say: a son or a daughter.
One who marries a woman and remains with her for ten years, and she does not bear a child -- he [still] is not permitted to desist from  [the commandment of "be fruitful and multiply"]. Rather, he goes out and gives her her ketubah lest he does not merit bearing children from her. And even though there is no proof of the matter, there is a hint of the matter, as it is said (Gen. 16:3), "at the end of ten years of Avram's settling in the land of Canaan."<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"> The full verse reads, "And Sarai, the wife of Avram, took Hagar the Egyptian, her hand-maid at the end of ten years of Avram's settling in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Avram her husband as a wife for him."</i> We learn from this that [the duration of] one's settling outside the Land [of Israel] is not included in the count.
She whose husband is elderly, or infirm, or her husband was incarcerated in prison, or her husband traveled overseas, these [time periods] are not included in the count. A divorcee should go and marry another, lest she did not merit to bear children from him. And up to how many is she permitted to marry? Up to three. More than that, she should only marry someone who [already] has a wife and children. If she married someone who has no wife or children, she goes out without her ketubah, because her marriage was entered into in error. § Rabbi Akiva says, whoever spills blood, behold, that person causes the image [of God] to be diminished, as it is said (Gen. 9:6), "One who sheds a man's blood, by a man his blood shall be shed, [for God made man in His image]." Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah says, anyone who does not occupy himself with [fulfilling the commandment of] "be fruitful and multiply," behold, he is a spiller of blood, and causes the image [of God] to be diminished, as it is said (Gen. 9:6-7), "for God made man in His image / And as for you, be fruitful and multiply." Ben Azzai says, anyone who does not occupy himself in "be fruitful and multiply," behold, he is a spiller of blood, and causes the image [of God] to be diminished, as it is said, "for in the image of God did He make man," and it is written, "And as for you, be fruitful and multiply, etc." Said to him Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah, beautiful are the words that flow from the mouth of one who sustains (i.e., fulfills) them. There are those who expound with beauty but do not sustain [their words] with beauty, and there are those who sustain with beauty but do not expound with beauty. Ben Azzai is one who expounds with beauty but who does not sustain with beauty (i.e., he has no children). He said to him: What should I do? My soul's desire is for the Torah, and let the world sustain itself through others.
