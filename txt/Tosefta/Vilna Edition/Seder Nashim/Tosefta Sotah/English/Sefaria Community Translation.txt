Tosefta Sotah



Chapter 1

Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, he (i.e., the jealous husband) warns [his wife regarding associating with a certain man] on the testimony of one witness or on his own testimony, and she drinks [the bitter waters] on the testimony of two (se Sot. 1:1). They responded to the words of Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda, there is no end to the matter. § What is the first testimony? That is the testimony of seclusion. The second? That is the testimony of defilement. And how much time [is required] for defilement [to occur]? As much time as it takes for intercourse. And how much time does intercourse take? As much time as the first stage of intercourse. And how much time does the first stage of intercourse take? Rabbi Eliezer says, the time it takes to circle a palm tree. Rabbi Yehoshua says, the time it takes to mix a cup of wine. Ben Azzai says, the time it takes to drink it. Rabbi Akiva says, the time it takes for a weaver to tie a knot. Chanan ben Pinchas says, the time it takes her to stick a finger in her mouth. Peleimo says, the time it takes her to stick her hand into a basket and take out a loaf of bread. And even though there is no proof of the matter, there is a hint to the matter, as it says (Prov. 6:26, JPS tr.), "The last loaf of bread will go for a harlot."
Rabbi Yehuda says: Her husband is trusted regarding her (i.e., not to have had relations with his wife on the journey to the Temple to perform the Sotah ceremony (see Sot. 1:3)). [This is learned out] from a <i>kal v'chomer</i>: Just as [the husband of a] menstruant, who is liable for excision if he has relations with her, is believed regarding her, [then with respect to the husband of a] suspected adulteress, who is not liable for excision if he has relations with her, is it not logical that her husband should be believed regarding her? They said to him: All the more so, since he is not liable for excision for having relations with her, should he not be believed regarding her<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., since his punishment is light, he would have less incentive to lie than one faced with excision</i>? Another version: [They said to him,] Not so. If you say that regarding a menstruant, who has permissible factors after the prohibition started<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., there will be a time when her menstrual flow ceases and she is permitted to her husband</i>, would you say the same regarding a suspected adulteress, who has no permissible factors after the prohibition started? And thus it says (Prov. 9:17, JPS tr.), "Stolen waters are sweet[, And bread eaten furtively is tasty]." Rabbi Yosei says, Scripture itself believes him regarding her, as it is said (Num. 5:15), "And the man shall bring his wife to the Kohen."
[If the suspected adulteress says that she is pure,] they bring her up to the Eastern Gate, to the Gate of Nicanor, which is where they give the suspected adulteress [the bitter waters] to drink, and [where] they purify women after childbirth, and purify lepers, as it is said (1 Kings 8:31-32), "Whenever a man sins against his neighbor [... and he brings it before Your Altar in this House], You shall hear, O Heavens, and take action and judge Your servants, condemning the wicked to bring down his conduct upon his head" -- [this refers to] (Num. 5:27): "Her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall fall." "And to vindicate the righteous, to bestow upon him according to his righteousness" (1 Kings 8:32) -- [this refers to] (Num. 5:27): "But if the woman did not defile herself and she is pure, she is to be held innocent and she shall bear seed." § She stands within and the Kohen stands without, as it is said (Num. 5:18), "And the Kohen shall stand the woman before Hashem," and there is no Kohen who is "before" Hashem. § Just as they believe [the husband] regarding her so that she will retract [her innocence and confess her guilt (see Sot. 14a:15)], they believe him regarding her so that she will <i>not</i> retract. They say to her, "My daughter, if it is clear to you that you are pure, stand on your clarity and drink, for these waters are similar only to dry poison that is placed on living flesh, which does no damage [as long as the skin is intact], but which if a wound is found there, it penetrates and goes down [into the bloodstream]." (See Sot. 7b:4, Steinsaltz.)
They do not give [the bitter waters] to two suspected adulteresses to drink at one time, so that the heart of one will not be strengthened by the other. Rabbi Yehuda says, it is not for that reason. Rather, it is because of what it says (Num. 5:16), "The Kohen shall bring her close [and stand her before Hashem]." He brings <i>her</i> close, and he does not bring two close.
The Kohanim draw lots among themselves [to determine who will participate in the Sotah ceremony]. Whoever's lot is drawn, even [if it is the lot of] the Kohen Gadol, he goes out and stands next to the Sotah, and he grabs ahold of her clothes (Sot. 1:5). If they are torn, so be it, and if they are rent apart (i.e., exposing her flesh), so be it, even until her chest (lit., "her heart") is bared, and he [also] loosens her hair. Rabbi Yehuda says, if her chest was attractive, he would not bare it, and if her hair was attractive, he would not loosen it, because of the young Kohanim (whose desire would be aroused).
[The Mishnah (Sot. 2:2) states that when the dust from the floor of the Temple is placed in the earthenware vessel, it "must be seen" floating on top of the bitter waters. The Tosefta comments:] Three [things] must be seen on top of water: The ashes of the [red] heifer, and the dust of the Sotah, and the blood of the bird [offering used to purify a leper (see Lev. 14:4-7)]. The ashes of the [red] heifer must be of sufficient quantity that they can be seen on top of the waters [of purification] (Par. 3:3). The dust of the Sotah must be of sufficient quantity that it can be seen on top of the [bitter] waters (Sot. 2:2). The blood of the bird [offering] of the leper must be of sufficient quantity that it can be seen on top of the [living] water (see Sot. 16b:6-8). [Relatedly,] the spittle of a Yevama (Deut. 25:9) must be of sufficient quantity that it can be seen by the eyes of the Elders.
The Kohanim are permitted to pour wine, oil, and honey onto the remainders of the [Sotah's] meal offering (see Sot. 2:1), but they are forbidden to cause it to become leavened. All meal offerings that are [prescribed] in the Torah require oil and frankincense except for the meal offering of the sinner and the meal offering of jealousy, as it is said (Num. 5:15), "He shall not pour oil onto it, nor place frankincense on it, etc." Rabbi Shimon says, all the sin offerings that are in the Torah do not require a libation except for the sin offering and the guilt offering of the leper, in order that a sin offering will not be of superior quality. Rabbi Tarfon says, all the remembrances that are in the Torah are [recorded] for good except for that which says (Num. 5:15), "[the meal offering of jealousy] is meal offering of remembrance, recalling iniquity." Rabbi Akiva says, even this is for good, as it is said (Num. 5:28), "And if the woman has not defiled herself, and she is pure, she will be cleansed and will be able to bear seed."

Chapter 2

He (i.e., the Kohen) would take her scroll [on which the Sotah's oath would be written] and bring it into the <i>Ulam</i>. A golden tablet [containing the fixed language of the oath  (Num. 5:19-22)] was lodged within the wall of the <i>Heichal</i>, and it was visible from the <i>Ulam</i>. From that he looks and he writes [onto the scroll]. He neither shortens nor lengthens. He goes out and stands at the side of the Sotah. He reads and expounds and is punctilious on all the details of the <i>parashah</i>. And [the oath] may be pronounced in any language that she can hear (i.e., understand), in order that she knows on what account she would be drinking [the bitter waters], and about what (במה not כמה) she would be drinking, on what account she became defiled, and about what she became defiled. And he says to her, "I adjure you and it will befall you." "And this will befall you" -- this is the curse. "I adjure you" -- this is the oath. § Rabbi Meir says, [when she responds <i>amen</i>, <i> amen</i> (see Sot. 2:5), she is responding] "<i>amen</i> that I was not defiled," and "<i>amen</i> that I will not become defiled." It is not that the [bitter] waters [necessarily] inspect her immediately (see Sot. 5:1); rather, even if she becomes corrupted twenty years later, the waters will expose her [corruption], as it is said (Num. 5:15), "[the meal offering of jealousy] is a meal offering of remembrance, recalling iniquity." § [Returning to the order of the ritual,] [the Kohen] enters and writes [the oath], [then] goes out and erases it.  
[If] before the scroll is erased, she said, "I will not drink," or she said, "I am defiled," or if witnesses came [and testified] that she is defiled, the [bitter] waters are poured out and they possess no holiness, and her scroll is hidden away beneath the hinges of [an entrance to] the <i>Heichal</i>, and her meal offering is scattered around. [Similarly, if] the scroll is erased [and then] she said, "I am defiled," the waters are poured out and they possess no holiness, and her scroll is hidden away beneath the hinges of the <i>Heichal</i>, and her meal offering is scattered on the ash heap, and her scroll is not valid to be drunk by another Sotah. 
[If] the scroll is erased  and [then] she said, "I will not drink," they pour it into her and make her drink it against her will. Rabbi Yehuda says, with iron tongs they open the mouth of that one and pour it into her and make her drink it against her will. Rabbi Akiva said to him, and if so, why would they make that one drink it, if not to check her? For behold, she [already] has been checked and been disgraced [by virtue of her refusal]. Rather, she is actually permitted to repent up until when her meal offering is offered up. [But once] her meal offering is offered up, and she said "I will not drink," they pour it into her and make her drink it against her will.
Rabbi Elazar says says, two jealousies are spoken of in the <i>parashah</i> of jealousy: One jealousy is the jealousy that she arouses in husband, and one is the jealousy that she arouses in the Place (i.e., God). Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of Rabbi Meir, what does the verse come to teach (Num. 5:22), "And the woman says, <i>amen</i>, <i>amen</i>." [It teaches that] she was fit to have Divine retribution befall her in abundance from that which she brought upon herself from these [alleged transgressions], which caused her to be brought to an uncertain [status].  But rather, [if she has spoken truly ("amen"),] then she shall be released from her disgrace (שניקתה בניוולה, see Jastrow), as it is said (Num. 5:28), "And she will be cleansed" -- cleansed from all Divine punishments that would have been fit to befall her. Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer ben Teima, what does the verse come to teach (<i>ibid.</i>), "And if she was not defiled"? That if she had [previously] given birth in pain, she will [now] give birth with ease; [if she had given birth] to females, she will give birth to males; [if] to ugly children, she will give birth to beautiful children; [if to] short children, she will give birth to tall children; [if] one at a time, she will give birth two at a time.
[The Mishnah (Sot. 3:4) states, Rabbi Yehoshua used to say, a foolish pious man, a sly wicked man, a female <i>perusha</i>, and the blows of the <i>perushim</i>, behold, they destroy the world. The Tosefta adds:] A child that outgrows his months (i.e., is younger than he appears) -- behold, he destroys the world. § For each and every act of intercourse in which her husband engaged with her [after he had warned her], behold, he is liable for it.
If her meal-offering contracted impurity before it was consecrated in the [earthenware] vessel (Num. 5:18), behold, it is like any meal-offering [that became defiled]: It can be redeemed and eaten. [But if it contracted impurity] after it was consecrated in the vessel, its form is allowed to decay and it is taken out to the place of burning.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Sot. 3:6, omitting "its form is allowed to decay," a phrase typically associated with disqualified animal sacrifices (see, e.g.,  Pes. 7:9, Shek. 7:3, Tos. Pesachim 4:1, Tos. Pesachim 6:6).</i> [If] she consecrated her meal-offering but there was not enough time [for the Kohen] to consecrate the handful [of the meal-offering] (Num. 5:26) before her husband dies, or before she herself dies, the remainders are forbidden, because from the beginning it came from a matter of doubt (i.e., whether adultery had occurred), and it atoned for its doubt and left.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">See Sot. 9:7, using identical language in connection with the heifer whose neck is broken.</i> [If] witnesses came [and testified] that she was defiled, whether in this case or in that case, her meal-offering is forbidden. [If] it turns out that they were conspiring witnesses, whether in this case or in that case, her meal-offering [reverts to being] unconsecrated.
[The Mishnah, Sot. 3:6, states, "And [as to] all those married to Kohanim, their meal-offerings are burnt." The Tosefta comments:] [As to] all those married to a Kohen, whether she is a Kohen, whether she is a Levite, whether she is an Israelite, her meal-offering is not eaten, because there is a "partnership" in it (i.e., her husband, the Kohen, has a share in it, and a Kohen's meal-offering is never eaten (Lev. 6:16)). But [by the same token,] the entire [meal-offering] is not offered upon the fire [at once] because there is a partnership in it. <i>How so?</i> He consecrates the handful by itself, and he consecrates the remainders by themselves. Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Shimon says, he consecrates the handful by itself, and the remainders he scatters.
A [male] Kohen stands and sacrifices on the Altar, which is not the case with a female Kohen. A man has authority over his daughter [with regard to] her betrothal, with money, with a document, or with relations, and [also] has authority over things she has found, and to the work of her hands (i.e., her earnings), and to the nullification of her vows (see Ket. 4:4), which is not the case with a woman. A man is liable for transgressing time-bound positive commandments, which is not the case with a woman. A man is liable  for transgressing the prohibitions against rounding [the corners of the head] and destroying [the corners of the beard] (Lev. 19:27), and against [a Kohen] contracting ritual impurity from a corpse (Lev. 21:1), which is not the case with a woman. A man is subject to the laws of the "wayward and rebellious son" (Deut. 21:18), but a woman is not subject to the laws of the wayward and rebellious son. A man [experiencing signs of leprosy] is subject to the laws of covering (Lev. 13:45) and shaving (Lev. 13:33), while a woman is subject to the laws of covering but not shaving. A man may be sold [as a slave] a second time, but a woman may not be sold a second time. A man may be sold a Hebrew slave, but a woman may not be sold a Hebrew slave. A man may have his ear bored (Ex. 21:6), but a woman may not have her ear bored. A man may acquire a Hebrew slave, but a woman may not acquire a Hebrew slave.

Chapter 3

Rabbi Meir would say, from where is it derived that can you say that, "With the [same] measure that a person measures others, they measure him"? As it is said (Is. 27:8), "In full measure (<i>b'sa'seah</i>) when You send her away do You contend with her" (Steinsaltz tr.). [From this] I only have that one who measures with a seah (<i>b'seah</i>) [is also measured by a seah].<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">It would thus seem that only the greatest transgressions (i.e., those compared to a "seah," a very large quantity) are punished in equal measure.</i> From where is it derived that [the same applies to] one who measures with [smaller measures, such as] a half-kav<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">there are four kavs to a seah</i>, two kavs (<i>tarkav</i>), a quarter-kav, and half of a quarter-kav, an eighth-kav (<i>toman</i>), and one thirty-second of a kav (<i>ukla</i>)? The verse states (Is. 9:4), "For all <i>se'on</i> He tramples with fierceness"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">literally, "For all the boots that trample loudly"; the word for "boots" (<i>so'en</i>) may be midrashically rendered as "a small fraction of a seah," see Sot. 8b:16</i> -- behold, here there are many measures and many calculations. [From this] I only have things that come with a set measure. From where is it derived that even small droplets (<i>perutot</i>; alt., "small coins") can combine into a large calculation? The verse states (Ecc. 7:27, Steinsaltz tr.), "[Behold, this have I found, says Koheleth, adding] one thing to another, to find out the account.” And thus you find with a Sotah that with the [same] measurement that she measured, she is measured with it. She stood in front of him in order that she appear pleasing before him; therefore, the Kohen stands her before everyone to display herself in disgrace, as it is said (Num. 5:18), "And the Kohen stands the woman before God [and lets loose (the hair of) the woman's head], etc." [Similarly,] she spread out her shawl before him; therefore, the Kohen removes the scarf from her head and places it under her feet.  She plaited her hair to please him; therefore, the Kohen loosens [her hair]. She adorned her face for him; therefore, her face turns green [after drinking the bitter waters]. She painted her eyelids for him; therefore, her eyes bulge out [after drinking]. She beckoned to him with her finger; therefore, her fingernails fall off. She exposed her flesh for him; therefore, the Kohen rends her cloak and exposes her disgrace to the masses. She girded herself inside [her clothes]; therefore, the Kohen brings an Egyptian rope and ties it above her breasts, and anyone who wants to see comes and sees. She opened her thighs for him; therefore, her thigh wastes away [after drinking]. She received him on her stomach; therefore, her stomach distends. She fed him delicacies; therefore, her grain offering (i.e., barley, see Num. 5:15) is animal fodder. She gave him wine to drink in the finest cups; therefore, the Kohen makes her drink the bitter waters from a broken fragment (<i>makida</i>) of an earthenware vessel. She acted in secret (<i>seter</i>), as it is said (Job 24:15), "The eye of the adulterer awaits the evening twilight, saying ['No one will cast an eye on me'...]," [but] she was not aware that He Who sits in His concealment of eternity was turning His face toward her, as it is said (ibid.), "and He places a mask (<i>seter</i>) on His face." Another version: It teaches that the Place exposes her concealment to the public, as it is said (Prov. 26:26), "He covers his hatred with deceit, [and thus] his wickedness shall be exposed in public."
The people of the [generation of] the Flood became haughty in front of the Place only due to the goodness that He showered upon them, as it says (Job 21:9-11): "Their homes are secure, without fear [and they do not feel the rod of God]. Their bull breeds and does not fail ... They let their infants run loose like sheep, etc."  This was the cause of their [downfall]. And they said to God (Job 21:14-15): "Leave us alone ... What is Shaddai that we should serve Him?" They said, "Why does He trouble Himself with us? All we need are two drops of water. Behold, ours are the rivers and the springs with which we supply ourselves on hot summer days and on rainy days, as it is said (Gen 2:6), "But a surge would well up from the earth [and water all the face of the ground]." The Place said to them, "It was with goodness that I bestowed [all this] on you, and you come with haughtiness before me? I am coming to destroy you," as it is said (Gen. 6:17), "As for me, here, I am about to bring on the Deluge, water upon the earth, etc." Rabbi Yosei ben Dormaskit says, the people of the [generation of] the Flood became haughty in front of the Place only with the sphere (<i>galgal</i>) of the eye, which resembles water, as it says (Gen. 6:2), "And the <i>b'nei ha'elohim</i> ("the sons of the judges/nobles"; alt., "the sons of the divine beings")   saw how beautiful the daughters of men were, etc." In the same way, the Holy One Blessed be He did not destroy them with anything but a gathering (<i>galgal</i>) of waters, which resembles the eye, as it is is said (Gen. 7:11), "On that day, all the fountains of the great deep burst apart [and the floodgates of the sky broke open]." (Note: Tanakh translations generally follow JPS.)
The people of the Tower [of Babel] became haughty in front of the Place only due to the goodness He showered upon them, as it says (Gen. 10:1-2, JPS Tr.), "Everyone on earth had the same language and the same words, and as they migrated from the east [they came upon a valley in the land of Shinar and settled (lit., 'sat') there]." And there is no "sitting" that does not involve eating and drinking, as it says (Ex. 32:6), "And the people sat to eat and drink etc." This was the cause of their [downfall]. And they said (Gen. 11:4), "Come let us build a city and a tower, etc." What does it say, but that "The Lord scattered them [over the face of the whole earth]" (Gen. 11:7).  The people of Sodom became haughty in front of the Place only due to the goodness He showered upon them, as it says: "A land from which bread had issued forth — its place was overturned, as if (consumed by) fire. A place of sapphire were its stones, and dusts of gold were there. (And now it is) a path unknown (i.e., unfrequented) by brigands, and unseen by the falcon's eye, untrodden by the haughty (beasts) and not crossed by the lion (Job 28:5-8). The people of Sodom [said]: "Since food comes out of our land, and silver and gold, and precious stones and pearls [all come] from our land, we have no need that other people will come to us to diminish [our valuables]. Let us rise and prevent the wayfarers to enter our cities [banot]!" The Holy One of Blessing said to them: "I gave goodness to you, and you seek to forget the wayfarers from your cities?! I will forget the wayfarers in your midst [beinechem] and I will forget you from the world!" What does it say? "He breaks open a shaft away from where men sojourn; they are forgotten of the foot that pass by; they hang afar from men, they swing to and fro." (Job 28:4) and "The tents of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure, in whatsoever God brings into their hand." (Job 12:6) and so it says "As I live—declares the Lord GOD—your sister Sodom and her daughters did not do what you and your daughters did.Only this was the sin of your sister Sodom: arrogance! She and her daughters had plenty of bread"(Ezekiel 16:48-49). Egypt became haughty in front of the Place Blessed be He only due to water, as it says (Ex. 1:22, JPS Tr.), "Then Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, “Every boy that is born [you shall throw into the Nile, but let every girl live]." In the same way, the Place Blessed e He only destroyed them with water, as it says (Ex. 15:4, JPS Tr.), "Pharaoh's chariots and his army He has cast into the sea." Sisera became haughty in front of the Place only due to legionnaires who did not receive wages (Judges 5:19, JPS Tr.), "Then the kings came, they fought [... and they got no spoil of silver]." And [when Yael entered the tent to kill him, the legionnaires] did not move from their places and they paid him no mind because he himself was merely a common soldier (see Jastrow, סָפַן).
Samson transgressed with his eyes (Sot. 1:8), as it is said (Jud. 14:3), "And Samson said to his father, 'Take her (i.e., the Philistine woman of Timnah) for me because she is pleasing to my eyes,'" and thus he was punished with his eyes, as it is said (Jud. 16:21), "And the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes, etc." Rebbi says, he started going astray in Gaza, and thus his punishment happened nowhere but Gaza itself. Absalom transgressed with his hair, as it is said (2 Sam. 14:25), "And there was no man so beautiful as Absalom [in all of Israel; from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head, he had no defect]." Therefore, he was punished with his hair (2 Sam. 18:9). Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says, Absalom was an "eternal nazirite," and once every twelve months he would shave his head. [From where is it derived that an "eternal nazirite" cuts his hair every twelve months?] As it is said (2 Sam. 15:7-8): "After forty years had passed, Absalom said to the king, 'Let me go [and I will fulfill my vow, which I vowed to the Lord in Hebron]. For your servant made a vow  [when I lived in Geshur of Aram, saying, 'If the Lord ever returns me to Jerusalem, I will worship the Lord.']."<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">The implication is that the "vow" Absalom referred to was a nazirite vow.</i> Rabbi Nehorai says, he would shave his head once ever thirty days, as it is said (2 Sam. 14:26), "And it was at the end of <i>each period of days</i> (יָמִ֤ים לַיָּמִים֙), etc., and the weight of [Absalom's] hair of his head was two hundred shekels by the king's weight."<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Rebbi and Rabbi Nehorai interpret the ambiguous phrase "each period of days" differently; Rebbi as denoting a year, and Rabbi Nehorai as a month. Note that the following passage, from "Rabbi Yosei says" to "Sabbath Eve," does not appear in the present text but appears in printed editions, supported by Lieberman.</i> Rabbi Yosei says, he would shave every Sabbath Eve, for it is the custom of the sons of kings to shave from Sabbath Eve to Sabbath Eve. [Rabbi Shimon says<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Per GR"A</i>,] like it says about kohanim (Ez. 44:20), "Their heads they shall not shave, and their locks they shall not grow out; [rather,] they shall trim their heads."  [On the subject of shaving from Sabbath Eve to Sabbath Eve (see Lieberman),] it is not the custom of the people of Tiberius and the people of Tzipporin to shave in this way. [Returning to the discussion of Absalom,] he engaged in relations with ten concubines of his father, and therefore ten spears were thrust into him, as it is said (2 Sam. 18:15), "And ten young men [who carried Joab's armor circled around and struck Absalom, and killed him]." And because he engaged in three acts of theft -- [stealing] the heart of his father, and the heart of the Beit Din, and the heart of all of Israel -- therefore three spears were driven into his heart, as it is said (2 Sam. 18:14), "And [Joab] took three spears in his hand [and drove them into the heart of Absalom]."
Sennacherib became haughty in front of the Place only due to an emissary<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word <b>מלאך</b> (emissary) can refer to either an emissary of man (a messenger) or an emissary of God (an angel); both senses are employed below.</i>, as it is said (2 Kings 19:23-24), "Through your emissaries (מַלְאָכֶ֘יךָ֮) you taunted the Lord, etc., [saying,] 'I have bore (i.e., dug for water) and I have drunk strange waters [and the soles of my feet have dried up all the canals of Metzor]." Therefore the Holy One, Blessed be He, did not destroy him with anything but an emissary, as it is said (2 Kings 19:35), "And it happened on that night, that an emissary (מַלְאַ֣ךְ) of the Lord went out and slew the Assyrian camp, etc." And all of them (i.e., the slain) were kings with crowns affixed to their heads. 
Nebuchadnezzar said, the inhabitants of the earth are unworthy of my dwelling among them. I will make myself a little cloud and I will dwell within it, as it is said (Is. 14:14, Koren tr.), "I will ascend above the heights of the cloud[, I will be like the Most High]." The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him (Is. 14:13), "And you said in your heart, 'I will ascend to Heaven; higher than the stars of God I will raise up my throne, etc.'" [Therefore] I am coming to bring you down to the pit of destruction (cf. Ps. 55:24). What does it say, but (Is. 14:15), "Even unto the underworld (She'ol) will you descend[, to the bottom of the pit]." You said, the inhabitants of the earth are unworthy of my dwelling among them; [therefore it is stated] (Dan. 4:25-30), "You shall be driven from men[, and with the beasts of the field shall you dwell, etc.]," "That very hour [His] word was fulfilled as to Nebuchadnezzar, and he was driven from men," [and] "All this came upon Nebuchadnezzar the king / At the end of twelve months..."

Chapter 4

[Thus far,] I have only derived that Divine punishment is meted out measure-for-measure, such that a person is measured (i.e., punished) according to the same measure that the person himself measures (i.e., sins). From where can you derive that the measure of Divine beneficence is five hundred times greater than the measure of Divine punishment (i.e., a good deed is rewarded five hundredfold)? [As to Divine punishment,] As it is written (Ex. 20:5), "[calling into account] the sins of the father upon the sons until the third and until the fourth of those who hate me." As to the measure of Divine beneficence, it is written (ibid.) "showing lovingkindness to thousands "<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">The traditional vowel markers for the word <b>אלפים</b> yields <i>alaphim</i> ("thousands"); however, the same letters can also yield <i>alpayim</i> ("two thousand), i.e., five hundred times four.</i> You must say [therefore] that the measurement of Devine beneficence is greater than the measure of Divine punishment by [a factor of] one to five hundred. And similarly you find regarding Abraham, that with the measurement that he measured, he was measured. Abraham "ran" (i.e., acted with alacrity) before the ministering angels on three occasions, as it is said (Gen. 18:2), "And he saw [them] and he ran to meet them, etc."; and (Gen 18:6) "And Abraham hastened into his tent, to Sarah, etc."; and (Gen. 18:7), "And to the flocks ran Abraham [and he took a young ox], etc." Thus, so too the Holy One, Blessed be He, "ran" before his descendants on three occasions, as it is said (Deut. 33:2), "Hashem <i>came</i> from Sinai and He <i>shone forth</i> from Sei'r for them; He <i>sent out beams</i> from Mount Paran, etc." Regarding Abraham it says, "he bowed down to the earth," so too the Holy One, Blessed be He, [did so] with Israel his descendants in the future, as it is said (Is. 49:23), "And kings will tend to your children, and their queens shall serve you as nurses; [They shall bow to you, face to the ground], etc." Regarding Abraham it says (Gen. 18:4, Fox tr.), "Pray let a little water be fetched," so too the Holy One, Blessed be He, [did so] with Israel, and he gave to [Abraham's] descendants a well in the desert [whose water] flowed in abundance for the entire camp, as it is said (Num. 21:17-18, Fox tr.), "[And Israel sang this song: Spring up, O well ...] The well that was dug out by princes! That was excavated by people's nobles!" It comes to teach that [the water] traveled over the entire face of the south, and irrigated the entire face of the wasteland, as it is said (Num. 21:20), "It overlooks the face of the wasteland." Regarding Abraham, it says (Gen. 18:4), "... and recline under the tree," so too the Holy One, Blessed be He gave to his descendants seven clouds of glory in the desert: One on their right, and one on their left, and one in front of them, and one behind them, and one above their heads, and one to the <i>Shekhinah</i> that was among them, and a pillar of cloud that was [placed] as an advance guard before them, killing snakes and scorpions and burning thorns and thistles and brambles [in their path]. He lowered for them the high places, and raised for them the low places, and made for them a straight pathway, and continually drew for them a marked pathway, as it is said (Num. 10:33), "And Hashem travels with the Ark of the Covenant before you, etc., " And it was in [that cloud] that they would serve Him all forty years that they were in the desert, as it is said (Num. 10:34), "And the cloud of Hashem was over them by day [in their journey from the camp]." What does it come to teach (Ex. 13:22), "The column of cloud would not depart by day[, nor the column of fire by night]"? That the column of the day would overlap with the column of night, and the column of night would overlap with the column of the day. Regarding Abraham, it says (Gen. 18:5), "And I will bring you a loaf of bread so that your hearts may be strengthened, etc." So too the Holy One, Blessed be He gave manna to his descendants in the desert, as it is said (Num. 11:8), "The people would go to and fro and collect it, etc., [and its taste was that of] a dainty (<i>lashad</i>) prepared with oil." The manna can be likened to a breast (<i>dad</i>):<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">It appears that <b>דד</b> (<i>dad</i>), as used here, is a euphemistic alteration of <b>שד</b> (<i>shad</i>), both meaning "breast," the word <b>שד</b> contained within <b>לשד</b> (<i>lashad</i>, i.e., "dainty"), and thus midrashically expounded with the former meaning.</i> Just as a breast is the most important thing for a baby, and everything [else] is secondary, so too the manna was the most important thing for Israel, and everything [else] was secondary to them. Another version: Just as a breast is such that even if a baby suckles from it the entire day it does not harm him, so too the manna was made such that even if [the Children of] Israel and of it the whole day, it would not harm them. But [unlike milk], whoever directed his thoughts toward [the manna], it would change itself inside his mouth to whatever taste that he desired, as it is said (Ps. 106:15), "He gave them what they asked for," [and] (Ps. 78:29), "He gave them what they craved." And not only that, but two thousand years' [worth] of food descended upon them in a single day. Regarding Abraham, it says (Gen. 18:7), "And to the flocks ran Abraham [and he took a young ox], etc." So too, the Holy One, Blessed be He swept in quail for his descendants from the sea, as it is said (Num. 11:31), "And a wind blew out from Hashem, and swept in quail from the sea, etc." [The quail were stacked] two cubits above the ground, the words of Rabbi Akiva (see ibid.). Rabbi Elazar the son of Rabbi Yosei HaGalili says [regarding the verse (ibid., Fox tr.)], "they spread out over the camp as far as a day's journey here [and a day's journey here]," what does it come to teach by repeating "and a day's journey here"? It teaches that [the quail] would ascend from the ground up until the firmament, and cover up the orb of the sun. And what does it mean (ibid.), "about two cubits on the face of the earth"? Two cubits were removed from the earth, so that one would not [even] need to trouble oneself to stoop down [in order to] take them away. Regarding Abraham, what does it say, but (Gen. 18:17), "And he stood over them [under the tree, and they ate]." So too the Holy One, Blessed be He, protected his descendants in Egypt, as it is said (Ex. 12:23), "And Hashem passed over the entrances, etc." With Abraham, what does it say, but (Gen. 18:17), "And Abraham went with them, to escort them." So too, the Holy One, Blessed be He, attached himself to his descendants for forty years, as it is said, "These forty years, Hashem your God is with you, etc."
Joseph merited the bones of his father (Gen. 50:7); so too, none other than Moses occupied himself with [Joseph's bones], as it is said (Ex. 13:19), "And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him." It teaches that the entire nation was occupying itself with [gathering] spoils, and he was occupying himself with [fulfilling] a mitzvah, as it is said (Prov. 10:8), "The wise-hearted accepts mitzvot, etc." [But] if Moses had not occupied himself with with it, would [the Children of] Israel not have occupied themselves with it? What does it say, but (Josh. 24:32), "And the bones of Joseph that the <i>Children of Israel</i> had brought up from Egypt, were buried in Shechem." Rather, as soon as as Israel saw Moses occupying himself with it, they said, "Leave it, for the honor of the great ones is more than that of the small ones" (i.e., it is a greater honor for Joseph's bones to be carried by Moses than by us; see Sot. 13a:11). And if Moses and [the Children of] Israel had not occupied themselves with it, would his own children not have occupied themselves with it? What does the verse say, but (Josh. 24:32),  "and [the bones of Joseph] became a heritage for the <i>children of Joseph</i>." Rather, as soon as his children saw that Moses and Israel were occupying themselves with it, they said, "Leave it, for the honor of the multitudes is more than that of the few."
How did Moses know where Joseph had been buried? They said: Serakh daughter, of Asher was of the same generation, and she went and said to Moses: "In the Nile River, Joseph is buried. And the Egyptians made for him metal skewers and affixed them with wood." Moses went and stood at the Nile River and said, "Joseph, the time has come for the Holy Blessed One to redeem Israel. Behold, the Shekhina is delayed for you, and the Israelites are delayed for you, and the clouds of glory are delayed for you. If you reveal yourself, good (okay!), and if not, we are cleansed of the oath which you have sworn upon our fathers." Then the coffin of Joseph floated to the surface and Moses took hold of it and went. And you should not wonder at this, for behold, it says (2 Kings  6:5), "And as one of [the disciples of the prophets accompanying Elisha] was chopping down a tree-trunk, the iron [axe head] fell into the water, etc., and the man of God said, 'Where did it fall?' and he showed him the place, and he cut off a stick and threw it there, and the iron [axe head] floated up." And behold, these matters are a <i>kal v'chomer</i> (a logical deduction): If Elisha, who was a disciple of Elijah, who was a disciple of Moses, could make iron float, then how much more so could Moses, who was the master of Elijah, who was the master of Elisha, [bring up the coffin of Joseph]! There are those who say that Joseph was buried in the crypt of the kings, and Moses went and stood above the crypt and said, "Joseph! Joseph! The time has arrived for the Holy One, Blessed be He, to redeem Israel. Behold, the <i>Shekhinah</i> awaits you, and Israel awaits you, and the Clouds of Glory awaits you. If you reveal yourself it would be well, and if not, we will be free (lit., "clean") of the vow that our fathers vowed." Immediately, the coffin (<i>aron</i>) of Joseph stirred, and Moses took it and carried it off. And there were two <i>aronot</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>aron</i> (<b>ארון</b>) means both "coffin/casket" and "ark/chest"; both senses will be employed here.</i> traveling together: The <i>aron kodesh</i> (the Holy Ark), and the <i>aron shel met</i> (the "ark" of the dead). And all the passersby would say, What is the nature of these two <i>aronot</i>? They said to them, one is the Holy Ark and one is the ark of the dead. They said to them, And how is it possible for the Holy Ark to travel alongside an ark of the dead? They said to them, the dead who is in this ark fulfills what is written in that which rests in that Holy Ark.
Moses merited the bones [of Joseph]; so too, none other than the Holy One, Blessed be He occupied himself with [Moses's bones], as it is said (Deut. 34:6), "And He buried him the the valley, etc." It teaches that he was carried by the body of the <i>Shekhinah</i> approximately four <i>mils</i>, from the portion of Reuben to the portion of Gad. [From where is it derived] that he died within the field of Reuben? As it is said (Num. 32:37), "And the children of Reuben built [Cheshbon<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>חֶשְׁבּוֹן</b> (Cheshbon) can also mean "a reckoning," as in the legal phrase <b>"דִּין וְחֶשְׁבּוֹן"</b> (<i>din v'cheshbon</i>), "an account and a reckoning," and thus may be midrashically associated with Moses the lawgiver; see also Bekh. 5a:12 ("Moses our teacher was ... an expert in reckoning (<b>חשבונות</b>). Alternatively, per the expanded text of MS Erfurt, the derivation is from the fact that Moses is recorded as dying on Mount Nebo (Deut. 34:1), which is then associated with Num. 32:38, "And the children of Reuben built ... Nebo, etc.," accord. Lieberman, Minchat Yitzchak.</i>], etc." And from where is it derived that he was buried within the field of the inheritance of Gad? As it is said (Deut. 33:20-21), "And to Gad he said, Blessed is he that enlarges Gad... And he selected the first part for himself, because there the portion of a lawgiver (i.e., Moses) was reserved." And the ministering angels eulogized and said before him (Deut. 33:21), "The justice of Hashem did he perform, and His laws with Israel." And thus it says regarding a suspected adulteress (Num. 5:22), "And may these bitter waters enter [into your intestines, to cause the belly to swell and the thigh to fall, etc.]." The thigh is the place where the transgression was initiated, [and thus] the Divine retribution begins there, and afterwards the belly, as it is said (Num. 5:27), "And when he gives her the waters to drink... [her belly shall swell and her thigh shall fall]."<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Note that Num. 5:21, in which "thigh" precedes "belly," may be the intended reference (see Bam. Rabbah 9:23, Sifrei Zuta 5:21:5).</i> And so too you find with the people of [the generation of] the Flood: Man was the initiator of transgression, as it is said (Gen. 6:5), "And God saw how great was the wickedness of Man on earth, etc.," and thus Man was stricken first, but the remainder did not escape, as it is said (Gen. 7:23), "And everything in existence was blotted out, [from Man, to cattle, to creeping things, and to the flying creatures, etc.]" [Similarly,] the residents of Sodom were the initiators of the transgression, as it is said (Gen. 19:4), "They (i.e., Lot and the two Divine emissaries) had not yet laid down when the men of the city [... encircled the house, etc.]," and thus they were stricken first, but the remainder did not escape, as it is said (Gen. 19:11 (Fox tr.)), "while the men who were at the entrance to the house[, they struck with dazzling-light—[all men] <i>great and small</i>]." The most powerful of Egypt -- they were the initiators of the transgression, as it is said (Ex. 1:22), "And Pharaoh commanded all his people saying, 'Every son [that is born shall be thrown into the River].'" [And as a result,] they were stricken first, but the remainder did not escape, as it is said (Ex. 7:29), "Onto you, and onto your people[, and onto all your servants will the frogs rise up]." The spies -- they were the initiators of the transgression, as it is said (Num. 13:32), "And they delivered an evil report of the Land that they had spied out, etc." [And as a result,] they were stricken first, but the remainder did not escape, as it is said (Num. 14:37), "And those men who delivered an evil report of the Land died," but the remainder did not escape, as it is said (Num. 14:35), "I am God, I have spoken if I will not do thusly [to the whole evil congregation]." The dwellers of the Land of Israel were the initiators of the transgression, as it is said (Jer. 12:14), "Thus says the Lord of Host regarding all the evil dwellers who lay a hand on the inheritance [of My people Israel], etc." Thus, so too they were stricken first, but the remainder did not escape, as it is said (<i>ibid.</i>), "I will uproot them from their lands, etc." The prophets of Jerusalem -- they were the initiators of the transgression, as it is said (Jer. 23:15, JPS tr.), "For from the prophets of Jerusalem, Godlessness has gone forth to the whole land." Thus, so too were they stricken first, but the remainder did not escape, as it is said (Jer. 29:22), "And there will be taken from [the false prophets Ahab and Zedekiah] a curse [extending] to all the exiles of Judah that are in Babylon, etc."
Just as she is forbidden to her husband, so too is she forbidden to her paramour (Sot. 5:1). Therefore, it is said regarding a suspected adulteress, that she cast her eyes on what was not fit for her, [and as a result] that which she sought was not given to her, and that which was in her hands was taken from her. And so too you find with the primeval snake, that it was craftier than all the animals and all the beasts of the field, as it is said (Gen. 3:1), "And the snake was craftier than all [the beasts], etc." It sought to kill Adam and marry Eve. The Place said to it, I said, you will be the king of all the animals and beasts, and now, since you did not desire that, you will be more accursed than all the animals and all the beasts of the field. I said, you will walk tall and upright, like a man. Now, since you did not desire that, "on your belly you will crawl" (Gen. 3:14). I said, you will eat from the food of man, and drink from the drink of man. Now, since you did not desire that, "and dust you shall eat all the days of your life" (ibid.). You sought to kill Adam and marry Eve. Now, "and enmity I will place between you and the woman" (Gen. 3:15). Thus, that which it sought was not given to it, and that which was in its hand was taken from it, and so too you find with Cain, Korach, and Bilaam, and Doeg, and Ahitophel, and Gahazi, and Absalom, and Adonijah, and Haman, that they cast their eyes on what was not fit for them. That which they sought was not given to them, and that which was in their hands was taken from them. 

Chapter 5

One who warns his betrothed, or his <i>yevama</i> while she was awaiting her <i>yavam</i>, if she secluded herself [with the man about whom she was warned] after they were married, she either drinks [the bitter waters] or she does not receive her ketubah. A young  man who marries a barren woman or an elderly woman, and he has [another] wife and children, she either drinks or she does not receive her ketubah. [If] she became pregnant by him (i.e., the jealous husband), or was nursing his child [at the time that she secluded herself], she either drinks or she does not receive her ketubah. 
A female Kohen, a female Levite, and a female Israelite who married a Kohen or a Levite, a female Nitin to a Nitin, a female <i>mamzer</i> to a <i>mamzer</i>, the wife of a convert or of a freed slave, or an <i>ailonit</i> (i.e., a woman who never showed signs of puberty) -- [as to all of these,] she either drinks [the bitter waters] or she does not receive her ketubah. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, an <i>ailonit</i>, does not drink and does not receive her ketubah, as it is said (Num. 5:28), "[If the woman was not defiled and she is pure,] she shall be cleared [of guilt] and she will surely <i>bear seed</i>." It comes out from this that one who is not fit to bear seed [does not drink]. However, [in a case involving a man] who warns his betrothed, or his <i>yevama</i>; while she was awaiting her <i>yavam</i>, [if] she secluded before she was married, she neither drinks nor receives her ketubah. A young man who marries a barren woman or an elderly woman, and who has neither [another] wife nor children -- she does not drink and she does not receive her ketubah. [Regarding a woman who] became pregnant by another man or was nursing the child of another man, she neither drinks nor receives her ketubah. Rabbi Elazar says (cf. Sot. 4:3, "The Sages say"), he may separate her [from him] and return her [to him] after a period of time.
A woman may become defiled with anyone except for a minor or someone who is not a man.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">See Num. 5:13, "and a <i>man</i> lay with her," etc.</i> Rabbi Yosei says, [the Court (see Sot. 4:5)] may make her drink, pending [her husband who is] a deaf-mute recovering his senses, or [her husband who is] an imbecile regaining his reason, or [her husband who is] a minor growing up, or if her husband went overseas, or if her husband was in incarcerated in prison -- [in all of these cases, the Court] makes her drink.
If she commits lewdness with her minor son and he performed the first stage of intercourse with her, Beit Shammai disqualifies her from [marriage into] the priesthood, and Beit Hillel deems her fit. [If] one witness says, "She was defiled," and one witness says, "She was not defiled"; if one woman says, "She was defiled," and one woman says, "She was not defiled" -- she either drinks or she does not receive her ketubah. Rabbi Yehuda says, [the Court] has no right to deprive her of her ketubah by [the testimony of] a single witness; rather, if one witness says, "She was defiled," and two witnesses say, "She was not defiled," [or] two witnesses say, "She was defiled," and one witness says, "She was not defiled," the single [testimony] is negated due to its minority [status].
Rabbi Meir would say: Just as there are different attitudes in consumption of food, so are there different attitudes with regards to women. Some men, if a fly [merely] passes over his cup, he sets it aside and does not taste it. That [fly in the cup refers to] corrupted women, when he wishes to divorce his wife [but has not done it yet]. Some men, if a fly falls into his cup, he throws it out and does not drink it. And this is the trait of Papus ben Yehuda, who would lock [the door of the house] before his wife, and would leave. And there is a man where, if a fly falls in his cup, he throws [the fly] out and then drinks it. This is the trait of any man who sees her speak to her neighbors and relatives, and leaves her be. And there is a man where, if a fly falls into the plate, he crushes it and eats it. And this is the trait of a corrupted man who sees his wife go out with her head uncovered, her heart warmed for her servants and maidservants, and spins cloth in the marketplace, and [whose shirt is] open on both sides, and bathes and plays around with the men. This is the command from the Torah to divorce her, for it is stated [Deuteronomy 24:1-2] "[When a man takes a wife, and marries her, then it comes to pass, if she find no favor in his eyes,] because he hath found some unseemly thing in her, [that he writes her a bill of divorce, and gives it in her hand,] and sends her out of his house... [and she departs out of his house, and goes and becomes another man's wife.]" The text calls him 'another', implying that he is not of similar constitution to the first, [for] the first one sent her away because of sin, and the second came and was lenient toward her. If he merits, the heavens will cause him to send her away from his possession, and if not, she will ultimately bury him, as it says [Deuteronomy 24:2] "or if the latter man dies." It is appropriate for this [type of] man dies, because of the woman he brought into his household. One who wishes his wife to die [so he can] inherit her, or that she should die so he can marry her sister, she will ultimately bury him. Similarly, if she wishes he would die so she can marry another, he will bury her.
One who betroths a woman out of embarrassment to her father [or] to her relatives -- at the end she will bury him. Similarly, a woman who becomes betrothed to him out of embarrassment to his father [or] to his relatives -- at the end he will bury her. Rabbi Meir would say, one who marries a woman who is improper for him transgresses on account of five negative commandments: (1) on account of "do not take vengeance" (Lev. 19:18); (2) and on account of "do not harbor a grudge" (ibid.); (3) "do not be hateful toward your brother in your heart" (Lev. 19:17); (4) "you shall love your neighbor as yourself" (Lev. 19:18); and (5) "your brother shall live with you" (see Lev. 25:35). And not only that, but he causes the [fulfillment of the commandment] to be fruitful and multiply to be removed from the world.
One who says to her husband, "The Heavens stand between me and you," he seeks a way to effect appeasement between them (Ned. 11:12), for thus we find regarding our Matriarch Sarah, that she said to our Patriarch Abraham (Gen 16:5), "Hashem will judge between me and you." Rather, thus she said to him (Gen. 21:10), "Expel this maidservant and her son." It teaches that our Matriarch Sarah saw Ishamael her (i.e., Hagar's) son building high places, and hunting locusts and offering them up and turning them to smoke for idol worship. She said, "Lest he teach Isaac my son to do thus, and he will go and worship thus, thereby desecrating the Name of Heaven by such things." He said to her, "After one bestows a benefit on a person, may he then disadvantage him (i.e., remove the benefit)? Thus, after we made her a queen, after we made her a lady, and brought her close to such greatness, shall we banish her from within our house? What will people say about us? Would not the Name of Heaven be desecrated by such a thing?" She said to him, "Since you say, 'This thing is a desecration of the Name,' let the Place decide between my words and your words." The Place decided between her words and his words, as it is said (Gen 21:12), "Everything (<i>kol</i>) that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice." Let the verse not say "everything" (i.e., since Sarah only made one request)! And why then does the verse say "everything"? It teaches that [God] was deciding a second time [between them], and [thus already] had decided a first time. Just as the second time was on account of Hagar, so too the first time was [also] on account of Hagar.
Rabbi Akiva expounded the verse (Lev. 11:33), "And every earthenware vessel [into which one of them (i.e., a <i>sheretz</i>) falls, everything inside it] shall impart impurity." It does not say "shall be impure"; rather, "shall impart impurity," for it can render others impure. And it teaches about the second loaf of bread that it may impart impurity on the third loaf of bread. <i>How so?</i> An oven (תנור not תגור) of first-degree impurity [renders] a loaf of bread [inside it] with second-degree impurity, [and if that loaf] touches a loaf, [it imparts] third-degree impurity. Said Rabbi Yehoshua, thus would Yehuda ben Patiri expound (Num. 35:4-5), "You shall measure outside the city, etc. [two thousand with a cubit]" One verse states "from the wall of the city and outward, one thousand cubits all around." How is it possible to say "two thousand with a cubit" when it has already said "one thousand cubits," and how is it possible to say "one thousand cubits" when it has already said "two thousand with a cubit"? And why does it say "one thousand cubits" [in one verse], and why does it say "two thousand <i>with a</i> cubit" [in the next verse]? Rather, [it comes to teach], one thousand cubits for pastureland, and two thousand cubits for the Sabbath boundary. Rabbi Eliezer, the son of Rabbi Yosei HaGalili says, two thousand cubits is the boundary of the Levitical cities. Subtract from them one thousand cubits of pastureland, and it comes out that one quarter [of the total area] is pastureland, and the remainder are fields and vineyards.   

Chapter 6

Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of ben Patiri, behold, it says (Job 27:2), "By the life of God, who turned aside from my justice, etc.," to teach you that a human being should never take a vow on the life of the King unless he loves the King. From this Rabbi Natan says, behold, it says (Job 13:16), "This too shall be my salvation, [that a godless person not come before Him.]" Rebbi says, [regarding Job,] it is said (Job 1:1), "God-fearing," and regarding Abraham it is said (Gen 22:12), "God-fearing." Regarding Job, just it is said "God-fearing," and regarding Abraham he acted with love even though he was God-fearing, so too with Job he acted with love even though he was God-fearing. And the rest of the murmurings (תַרְעוֹמוֹת) spoken of in that <i>parasha</i> were only spoken from within that fear [of God].
...Drashed Rabbi Akiva: At the time that Israel went up from the sea, they wanted to sing, and the Divine Spirit came to them and they sang.How?   They sang it like the Hallel HaGadol (Psalm 136) is sung in synagogues- the leader sings, and everyone else responds.  Moshe said "I will sing to Adonai!", and Israel responded "I will sing to Adonai!".  Moses said "God is my strength and my salvation!" and Israel responded, "I will sing to Adonai!".  Moses said "Adonai is a Warrior!" and Israel said "I will sing to Adonai!".   Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosi HaGalili said: It's like a kid who reads the Hallel in a school- the leader says it, and the child responds afterwards with each and every word.  Moses said, "I will sing to Adonai!", and Israel said "I will sing to Adonai!".   Moses said "God is my strength and my salvation!" and Israel responded, "God is my strength and my salvation!", etc.   Rabbi Nechemiah said: It was like the way people read Sh'ma in synagogues, as it says, "Thus sang Moshe and the Children of Israel, etc."- [It was that] Moshe opened with a phrase, and Israel answered after him and completed it with him.  Moshe said "Thus sang..." and Israel responded "I will sing to Adonai, for God has triumphed gloriously!".  Moshe said "God is my strength and my salvation" and Israel responded "This is my God, Whom I will glorify!" Moshe said, "Adonai is a Warrior!" and Israel said "Adonai is God's Name!" etc.
Said Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai: There were four matters that Rabbi Akiva expounded upon [midrashically], but I prefer my own words to his. Rabbi Akiva expounded (Gen 21:9), "And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian that she bore to Abraham <i>m'tzachek</i> (lit., 'laughing' or 'sporting')." <i>Laughter</i> is not what is being spoken of here; rather, idol worship, as it is said [during the sin of the golden calf] (Ex. 32:6), "And the people sat down to eat and drink, and [then] they arose to sport (<i>l'tzachek</i>)." It teaches that our Matriarch Sarah saw Ishmael building high places and hunting for locusts, and offering it up and turning it into smoke for idol worship. Rabbi Eliezer, the son of Rabbi Yosei HaGalili says, laughter (<i>tzachok</i>) is not spoken of here; rather sexual immorality, as it is said [in the matter of Potiphar's wife] (Gen 39:17), "The [Hebrew] servant came to me, etc., to sport (<i>l'tzachek</i>) with me." It teaches that our Matriarch Sarah saw Ishmael trampling the gardens and afflicting the women. Rabbi Yishmael says, the word <i>tzachok</i> means nothing other than the spilling of blood, as it is said (2 Sam. 2:14-16), "And Abner said to Joab, 'Let the young men arise and sport (<i>visachaku</i>) before us', etc. And they got up and they were counted by number, etc. And each man grabbed his neighbor by the head and [stuck] his sword into his neighbor's side, and they fell together." It teaches that our Matriarch Sarah was seeing Ishmael taking a bow and arrow and shooting them toward Isaac [as though in sport], as it is said (Prov. 26:19-20, JPS tr.), "Like a madman scattering deadly firebrands, arrows, is one who cheats his fellow and says, 'I was only joking.'" And I say, God forbid that there would be such things occurring in the house of this same tzaddik (i.e., Abraham)! Is it possible that the one for whom it is said (Gen. 18:19), "For I have known him in order that he command [his sons and his household after him, that they shall heed the path of God, to perform righteousness and justice]," that there would be idol worship, sexual immorality, and the spilling of blood in his household?! Rather, "<i>tzachok</i>" is only mentioned here in connection with inheritance, for from the time that our Patriarch Isaac was born to our Patriarch Abraham, everyone was joyous, and they said, "A son is born to Abraham! A son is born to Abraham!" He had waited for so long, and he was given two portions. And Ishmael laughed to himself, and he said, "Don't be foolish! Don't be foolish! I am the first-born and I will take a double-portion." Then, at the conclusion of the matter, you learn, as it is said (Gen. 21:10), "for the son of this maidservant [shall not inherit with my son, with Isaac]." And I prefer my words to the words of Rabbi Akiva.
Rabbi Akiva expounded (Num. 11:22), "Are there flocks and herds to be slaughtered for them, <i>u'matza</i> (וּמָצָ֥א) for them?" [What is the meaning of "<i>u'matza</i>"?] Would it really <i>suffice</i> for them? "Or are there all the fish of the sea [to be gathered for them <i>u'matza</i> for them]?" [Here too, <i>u'matza</i> means,] would it really <i>suffice</i> for them? For example, as it says (Lev. 12:8), "And if her means do not suffice (<i>tim'tzah</i>) for a sheep[, she shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons]." And what was worse, this (i.e., "Are there [enough] flocks?") or (Num. 20:10), "Hear now, you rebels!"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, it appears a more severe transgression for Moses to question whether God could provide enough meat than Moses's castigating the people in the episode with the rock, yet he was punished for the latter but not the former.</i> Certainly this utterance was worse than "Hear now, you rebels!" Rather, when one desecrates the Name of the Heavens privately, they spare him, but [when one desecrates God] in public, they exact punish him. This (i.e., the first episode), which was in private, the Place spared him. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, even this [episode] which occurred in private, the Place did not spare him, as it is said (Num. 11:23), "Now you will see whether my word comes to pass, or not." And I say, God forbid that it would enter the mind of that righteous man, that he would say, "The Place does not suffice for us and for our livestock." Is it possible for he about whom it is said (Num. 12: 6-7), "Not so my servant, Moses[, in all my house he is trusted]," that it would enter his mind to say, "The Place does not suffice for us and for our livestock"? And moreover, when the Children of Israel were in Egypt, did the Nile River really have [enough] fish to suffice both for them and for the Egyptians (see Num. 11:5), and were there really [enough] livestock in Egypt to suffice both for them and for the Egyptians? Rather, this only refers to the matter, as it is said (Num. 11:19-20), "Not [just] for one day will you eat it, etc., but [rather] for a month of days...." Said Moses before the Holy One Blessed be He, "Master of the Universe, is it fitting that you give [all this] to them and then kill them? Do we say to a person, 'Take this loaf of bread and descend to <i>Sheol</i>?' Do we say to a donkey, 'Take this <i>kor</i> of barley and then we will chop off your head?' For they should not say about me and about you, "The meat did not suffice (<i>motzeit</i>)."<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, that God could not sustain them, so He killed them before the limits of His power were exposed. Alternatively, "No good news goes out (<i>motzeit</i>) from them" (אֵין־בְּשׂוֹרָ֥ה מֹצֵֽאת) (2 Sam. 18:22) (see MS Erfurt, Minchat Bikkurim, Lieberman).</i> He said to him, "And is it fitting for them to say, 'The Place does not have enough to give us and our livestock?' Rather, those [who said this] should perish and a thousand more like them. But do not shorten your hand before me for even an hour, as it is said (Num. 11:23), "And God said to Moses, is the hand of God too short, etc.?" Rabban Gamaliel the son of Rabbi Yehuda HeNasi says, "It is impossible to stand against their frivolous ways. If you give them the meat of large livestock, they will say, 'We asked for the meat of small livestock!' If you give them the meat of small livestock, they will say 'We asked for the meat of wild animals and poultry!' If you give them the the meat of a wild animals and poultry, they will say, We asked for the flesh of fish and locusts!'" As it is said, "Are there flocks and herds to be slaughtered for them?" Whereupon the Holy Spirit answered him, "Now you will see whether my word comes to pass, or not." And I prefer my words to the words of Rabbi Akiva.
Rabbi Akiva expounded, behold it says (Ez. 33:24), "Son of man, those who reside in these ruins [of the Land of Israel], etc."<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">The full verse reads, "Son of man, those who reside in these ruins of the Land of Israel say, 'Abraham was only one [person] and he inherited the Land. Thus, as for us, who are many, have we not been given the Land as an inheritance?'"</i> And are these words not a <i>kol v'chomer</i> (logical deduction)? Since Abraham, who served only one God, inherited the Land, does it not follow that we, who serve many gods, should also inherit the Land?
[Alternatively,] Rabbi Nehemiah says, [those residing in the Land of Israel argued as follows:] Since Abraham, who only had one son and offered him up, inherited the Land, does it not follow that we, who have sons as well as daughters offering up sacrifices for idolatry, should also inherit the Land? [Alternatively,] Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Yosei HaGalili says, [those residing in the Land argued as follows:] Since Abraham, who had no one to depend on (במי לתלות), inherited the Land, does it not follow that we, who have [many] to depend on, should also inherit the Land? And I (Rabbi Shimon) say, [those residing in the Land argued as follows:] Since Abraham, who was only given one commandment to perform, inherited the Land, does it not follow that we, who have been given all the commandments to perform, should inherit the land? You should know that this is also apparent from the answer given by the prophet, as you may infer, as it is said (Jer. 33:25-26), "Thus said the Lord, with the blood you have eaten, etc." and "You have relied on your sword, etc." "With the blood you have eaten" -- that is a limb from a live animal. "You raise your eyes to your idols" -- that is the worship of the stars. "And blood you have spilled" -- that is the spilling of blood (i.e., murder). "You have relied on your sword" -- that is the delay in executing justice, and thievery. "You have committed abominations" -- that is sexual relations with [another] male. "You have defiled your neighbor's wife" -- that is the uncovering of nakedness (i.e., sexual immorality). And are these words not a <i>kal v'chomer</i>? For the Children of Noah did not perform the seven commandments which were commanded to them before [they were dispossessed of the land]; how can you thus say, "Let us inherit the Land" (i.e., when you have failed to perform so many more commandments)? And I prefer my words to the words of Rabbi Akiva.
Rabbi Akiva expounded, behold, it says (Zech. 8:19), "Thus said the Lord, the fast of the fourth, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth [shall be for the House of Judah for joy and for happiness]." The "fast of the fourth" -- that is the 17th of Tammuz, on which the city was breached. And why is its name called "fourth"? Because it is the fourth of the months (i.e., starting with Nissan). The "fast of the fifth" -- that is the 9th of Av, the day that the Holy Temple was burned. And why is its named called "fifth"? Because it is the fifth month. The "fast of the seventh" -- that is the 3rd of Tishrei, the day that Gedaliah ben Achikam was killed, that Ishmael ben Nethaniah killed him, to teach you that the deaths of the righteous are just as difficult before the Place as the destruction of the Holy Temple. And why is its named called "seventh"? Because it is in the seventh month. The "fast of the tenth" -- that is the 10th of Tevet, the day in which the King of Babylonia placed his hand on Jerusalem, as it is said (Ez. 24:1-2), "And the word of God came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, [on the 10th of the month]: 'Son of Man, write down [this date], etc." And I say, the fast of the tenth, that is the 5th of Tevet, in which the report reached the children of the exile, as it is said (Ez. 33:21), "And it was in the twelfth year, on the tenth [month], on the fifth of the month, a fugitive from Jerusalem came to me [saying, 'The city has fallen.']" When they heard [the report], they made the day of hearing like the day of the burning [of the Temple]. And is it not proper to write of the first [events first]? And why is [the hearing of the report] written last? So as to order the months in accordance with their [historical] order (i.e., the destruction preceding the news reaching Babylonia). And I prefer my words to the words of Rabbi Akiva, for Rabbi Akiva speaks about first things last, and about last things first, and I speak about first things first, and about last things last.

Chapter 7

The oaths [imposed on] witnesses and judges may be spoken in any language that is heard, and [once] they respond "amen" to him, behold, they are liable in the oaths of the judges. <i>How is this?</i> Behold, whoever obligates his fellow in an oath, they say to him, "Beware that the whole world trembled on the day that it was said (Ex. 20:7), 'Do not take the name of the Lord your God [in vain].'" Every transgression that is [written] in the Torah, it is written as to them, "And cleanses" (Ex. 34:7). And this one, it is written as to it, "And does not cleanse" (ibid.). All the transgressions that are in the Torah, they punish him. And this one, they punish him and the whole world, and the sin of the entire world shall depend on it, as it is said (Hos. 4:2-4:3), "[False] swearing, etc.... On account of this, the earther is withered." Every transgression that is in the Torah, they punish him. And this one, him has close relatives, as it is said (Koh. 5:5), "Do not let your mouth bring your flesh (בְּשָׂרֶ֔ךָ) to sin." And "flesh" means only "close relatives," as it is said (Is. 58:7), "And do not ignore your own flesh (בְּשָׂרְךָ֖)." Every transgression that is in the Torah is suspended for him for two or three generations, but this one [is imposed] immediately, as it is said (Zech. 5:4, see JPS tr.), "I have sent it (i.e., the curse) forth, the word of the Lord of Hosts, [and it shall enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name]." "Sent it forth" -- immediately. "And it shall enter the house of the thief" -- this is one who swears falsely and knows that he does not have it in his hand, and deceives humanity. "And the house of one who swears falsely by My name" -- [it means] what it says. Every transgression that is in the Torah, [he is punished] with his money. This one, with his money and with his body, as it is said (ibid.), "and it shall lodge (וְלָ֙נֶה֙) inside their house." Come and see, things that the fire does not consume, a false oath destroys them.
If he said, "I did not swear," they exempt him. And if he said, "I swore," this one says to that one (Num. 16:26, JPS tr.), "Pray, turn away from the tents of these wicked men."
They make him swear with the oath that is written in the Torah, as it is said (Gen. 24:3), "I will swear to you by the Lord, the God of the Heavens, and the God of the Earth." They say to him, "Know that we do not administer an oath to you based on a stipulation in your heart; rather, your oath is taken based on our understanding and on the understanding of the court" (Ned. 25a:2, Steinsaltz tr.). And thus we find that Moses imposed an oath on the Children of Israel in the wilderness of Moab. He said to them, "Not on a stipulation in your heart," as it is said (Deut. 29:14), "And not with you alone [do I make this covenant]."
The blessing of the Hallel, the Shema, and the tefilah (i.e., the Amidah) may be recited in any language (cf. Sot. 7:1). Rebbi says, I say that the Shema may only be recited in the Holy tongue, as it is said (Deut. 6:6), "And <i>these</i> words, etc."
The Priestly Blessing (see Sot. 7:2): These [are recited] at the time that the Kohanim stand (עומדין not אומרים ("say"), see Lieberman) on the steps of the Ulam (see Tamid 7:2). Everyone is fit to ascend the steps of the Ulam, whether they are unblemished, or whether they have a blemish, whether it is his shift, or whether it is not his shift, except for one who has a blemish on his face, on his hands, or on his feet, for were he to raise his hands [to perform the Priestly Blessing] the people would look at him. Just as the raising of the hands [is performed] in the Temple, so too is the raising of the hands [is performed] in the outlying areas.
It so happened with Rabbi Yochanan ben Berokah and Rabbi Elazar ben Hisma, that they were traveling from Yavneh to Lod, [and they stopped] to pay a visit to Rabbi Yehoshua in Peki'in (בפקיעין not מפקיעין). Rabbi Yehoshua said to them, "What news do you have from the house of study today?" They said to him, "Rabbi, we are your students, and from your waters we drink." He said to them, "It is impossible that there nothing new was discussed in the house of study. Whose week was it (see Ber. 28a:13)?" They said to him, "Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah." He said to them, "What did he discuss?" They said to him, "[He discussed the commandment of <i>Hakhel</i>, to] 'Gather the people, the men, the women, and the little children'"(Deut. 31:10-12).  He said to them, "What did he expound about it?" They said to him, "He expounded thus: If men came to learn [and] women came to listen, why did the little children come? In order to bestow a reward upon those who brought them. And another thing that he expounded (Dev. 26:17-18), 'You have declared today for Hashem [to be your God] ... [and] God has declared today for you [to be his treasured people].' The Holy One Blessed be He said to Israel, just as you have made me your only object of love in this world, so too I will make you my only object of love in the World to Come."
And he (i.e., Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah) also expounded (Ecclesiastes 12:11) "The sayings of the wise are like goads, like nails fixed in prodding sticks. They were given by one Shepherd." Just as the goad directs the cow so as to bring life to the world, so too words of Torah are only life for the world, as it is said, “It is a tree of life . . .” [Proverbs 3:18]. Or, just as the goad is movable, might it be so for words of Torah? Scripture says, “And like nails firmly planted.” [Or, might (words of Torah like nails) neither diminish nor increase? Scripture says, “firmly planted.”] Just as a plant flourishes and grows, so too words of Torah flourish and grow. 'Masters of Assemblies' these are students of the wise that enter into multiple assemblies and declare what is impure [to be] impure, and what is pure [to be] pure; what is impure [to be] in its place and what is pure [to be] in its place. Perhaps it will arise in one's mind that since Beit Shammai [declares] impure and Beit Hillel [declares] pure, so-and-so prohibits and so-and-so permits, [Why] should I henceforth study Torah? Scripture teaches "words" "the words" "these are the words" [see Exodus 19:6-7] all of these words were given by "one Shepherd" [Ecclesiastes 12:11]. One God created them, one Benefactor gave them, the Master of all deeds, blessed be He, said them. Now make for your heart chambers within chambers and bring into it the words of Beit Shammai and the words of Beit Hillel, the words of those who declare impure and the words of those who declare pure. [After hearing what had been expounded in the house of study, Rabbi Yehoshua] said, "There is no generation that [can be considered] orphaned, if Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah dwells in its midst."
The wooden platform [erected for the portion read by the king (Sot. 7:8)], they would make in the Temple Courtyard and he sits on it. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says, on the Temple Mount, as it is said (Neh. 8:3-6), "He read it facing the plaza that was in front of the Water Gate, from early morning until midday, etc. And Ezra the scribe stood on a wooden toward  that they made him for that purpose, etc. And Ezra opened the scroll in the sight of all the people, etc. And Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God, and all the people answered, 'Amen, Amen', etc." And it says (2 Chron. 23:13), "And [Athaliah] looked, and there was the king standing on his platform at the entrance, and the officers and the trumpeters [by the king]." That same day, the Kohanim stand at the gates and at the breaches (Mid. 2:3), with golden trumpets in their hands. They blow <i>tekiah</i>, and <i>teruah</i>, and <i>tekiah</i>. [As for] any priest without a trumpet in his hand, they would say, "This one is like someone who is not a priest." There would be a great [financial] reward for the people of Jerusalem, who would hire out trumpets for a golden dinar. That same day, Rabbi Tarfon saw a lame man (=חיגר (see Hag. 1:1)) blow <i>teruah</i> on the trumpet, and from that they said that a lame man can blow [the trumpet] in the Temple. § In the name of (משום) Rabbi Natan they said, "Israel was liable for the destruction, for they defiled themselves for Agrippas the King" (see Sot. 7:8).
[With respect to the portion read by the king,] he reads from the beginning [of Deuteronomy], "These are the words..." (Deut. 1:1) until [the passages beginning with] "Shema" (Deut. 6:4), "And it will come to pass if you listen" (Deut. 11:13), "Tithings you shall tithe" (Deut. 14:22), [and] "When you have finished tithing" (Deut. 26:12). Rebbi says, he did not need to begin from the beginning of the book, rather, "Shema," "And it will come to pass if you listen," "Tithings you shall tithe," "When you have finished tithing," and the parashah of the king until its conclusion (Deut. 17:8-20). And the expositors expounded upon it [midrashically], and continued until the end [of the parashah]." "For the Lord your God is the one who goes out with you" (Deut. 20:4) -- that is the name that was given in the Ark, as it is said (Num. 31:6), "And Moses sent them out, a thousand per tribe, to wage war, them and Pinchas [son of Elazar the Priest of the army, and holy vessels and trumpets for sounding the blasts in his hand.]" It says that Pinchas was anointed for the war, and "the holy vessels" -- this is the Ark, as it says (Num. 4:20), "And they shall not see the covering [of the Holy, or they will die.]" And there are those who say that these are the priestly garments, as it is said (Ex. 29:29), "And the holy garments [that are Aaron's shall be for his sons after him]." Rabbi Yehuda ben Lakish says, there were two Arks: one that went out with them to war, and one one that remained with them in the camp. This that went out with them to war had in it the Torah scroll, as it is said (Num. 10:33), "And the Ark of the Covenant of God journeyed before them, etc." And this that remained with them in the camp, this is what had the broken tablets in it, as it is said (Num. 14:44), "And the Ark of the Covenant of God and Moses did not depart from the camp."
Twice he goes out and speaks with them: Once at the border, and once about the regulations of war. That which is on the border, what does he say? "Go forth and hearken to the words of the [anointed] priest." That which is about the regulations of war, what does he say (Deut. 20:5)? "Who is the man who has built a new house and did not inaugurate it? Let him go forth and return to his home." [If] his house it fell down and he built it [again], behold, that one returns. Rabbi Yehuda says, if he added anything new to it, he returns, and if not, he does not return. Rabbi Eliezer says, the people of Sharon did not have to return to their homes because they renovate them one time every sabbatical cycle.
(Deut. 20:6) "And who is the man who planted a vineyard and has not deconsecrated it? Let him go forth and return to his home." It is the same whether one plants a vineyard or whether one plants five fruit trees of five different species, even in five different towns -- behold, this one returns [to his home]. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says, I don't derive anything but a vineyard from that verse.
(Deut. 20:7) "And who is the man who has betrothed a woman?" It is the same whether one betroths or whether one performs <i>yibbum</i>, even one there is a widow waiting for a <i>yavam</i> among five brothers, and even if there are five brothers who heard that their brother died are at war, all of them return and come. § [Thus far,] I have only derived that one who built his house and did not inaugurate it, planted a vineyard and did not deconsecrate it, betrothed a woman  but did not take her [as a wife].  [If one] built a house and inaugurated it but twelve months did not pass, planted a vineyard and deconsecrated it but twelve months did not pass, [or] betrothed a woman and took her [as a wife] twelve months did not pass, from where is it derived that they do not move from their place? The verse states (Deut. 24:5), "When a man takes a new wife." This matter was included in the general rule, so why was it specifically mentioned here? In order to make a comparison with it: Just as this betokens that [as to] one who betrothed a woman and took her and twelve months did not pass, that he does not move from his place, so too that is the case with all of them.
For thus the Torah teaches the way of the world: When a man is given a livelihood, he acquires for himself a house. If he is again given [means], he acquires for himself a field. If he is yet again given [means], he acquires for himself a wife, as it is said (Deut. 20:5-7), "Who is the man who has built ... and who is the man who has planted ... and who is the man who has betrothed a wife." And so too Solomon said with his wisdom (Prov. 24:27), "Prepare your work outside, [Get ready what you have in the field, Then build yourself a home]." "Prepare your work outside" -- that is a house. "Get ready what you have in the field" -- that is a field. "Then build yourself a home" -- that is a wife. Another version: "Prepare your work outside" -- that is Scripture. "Get ready what you have in the field" -- that is Mishnah. "Then build yourself a home" -- that is Midrash. Another version: "Prepare your work outside" -- that is Mishnah. "Get ready what you have in the field" -- that is Midrash. "Then build yourself a home" -- that is Halachot. Another version: "Prepare your work outside" -- that is Midrash. "Get ready what you have in the field" -- that is Halachot. "Then build yourself a home" -- that is Aggadot. Another version: "Prepare your work outside" -- that is Halachot. "Get ready what you have in the field" -- that is Aggadot. "Then build yourself a home" -- that is Talmud. Rabbi Eliezer the son of Rabbi Yosei HaGalili says, "Prepare your work outside" -- that is Talmud. "Get ready what you have in the field" -- that is good deeds. "Then build yourself a home" -- come and expound it, and receive your reward. 
(Deut. 20:8) "And the officers shall gather, etc." "He who is afraid and soft of heart" -- that he is afraid because of the transgressions he has committed, as it is said (Ps. 49:6), "Why should I fear in times of evil," the words of Rabbi Yosei HaGalili.  Rabbi Akiva says, "Who is the man who is afraid" -- [this means] afraid literally. Why does the verse mention that "the soft of heart" return as well? For even the bravest of the brave and the strongest of the strong, [if] he was merciful, he would return, as it is said (Deut. 20:8), "So he does not melt his brothers' hearts, like his own heart." Rabbi Shimon says, anyone who hears the words of the priest concerning the regulations of war and does not return, at the end he falls by the sword and brings down [the rest of] Israel by the sword, and causes them to be exiled from their land, and others come and settle in their land, as it is said (Deut. 20:7) "[Lest he die in battle] and another man take her." "Another" -- you might think his uncle or the son of his uncle (cf. San. 3:4). Rather, it says here "another," and it says later on (Deut. 28:32) "another." Just as the "another" that is spoken of later on is an idolater, so too the "another" that is spoken of here is an idolater. § If he heard that his brother died in battle before he sallied forth [to battle], he returns; once he sallied forth, he does not return.
There are those who go out and return, who go out and do not return, and there are those who do not go out at all. All those about whom they said "They go out and return," they pay city taxes, and they provide water and food for the battle, and they repair the roads. All the rest are those who do not return. All those about whom they said "They do not go out at all": [If] he builds a house and inaugurates it but twelve months did not pass, he planted a vineyard and deconsecrated it but twelve months did not pass, [or] he betrothed a woman and took her [as a wife] but twelve months did not pass, these do not pay city taxes, and they do not provide water and food for the battle, and they do not repair the roads. Rabbi Yehuda would designate an optional war as a "war of mitzvah," but for an obligatory war, everyone goes out, even a bridegroom from his chamber and a bride from her wedding canopy.

Chapter 8

The blessings and the curses are those that Israel pronounced when Israel crossed the Jordan, as it is said (Deut. 27:2), "And it shall be on the day that you cross the Jordan." How did Israel cross the Jordan? On every [other] day the Ark would travel after two banners, but on this day it traveled in front, as it is said (Josh. 3:11), "Behold, the Ark of the Covenant of the Master [of the whole world is passing before you]." On every [other] day the Levites were carrying the Ark, but on this day the priests carried it, as it is said (Josh. 3:13), "When the soles of the feet of the priests [bearing the Ark of God] came to rest, etc." Rabbi Yosei says, in three places the priests carried the Ark: One, when Israel crossed the Jordan; and one, when they circled around Jericho; and one, when they returned it to its place (i.e., in the Holy of Holies).
And as soon as the feet of the priests first entered the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan piled up, as it is said (Josh. 3:16), "And the water piled up [... at Adam, the town that is next to] Tzartan." Twelve <i>mil</i> by twelve <i>mil</i> was the height of the water, the words of Rabbi Yehuda. Said, Rabbi Elazar bar Shimon, and which one is lighter, water or man? They would say water is lighter than man. It teaches that the waters were stacked up and reached upward, wave upon wave, about three hundred <i>mil</i>, until the kings of every nation saw them, as it is said (Josh. 5:1), "And when all the kings of the Amorites, which are on the other side of the Jordan westward ...  heard [that God had dried up the waters of the Jordan], etc." And so too Rachab says to the emissaries of Joshua (Josh. 2:10-11), "For we heard that God had dried up the Sea of Reeds before them, etc., and when we heard, our hearts melted, etc." 
When they were still in the Jordan, Joshua said to them, "For this purpose are you crossing to the Land: That you will dispossess its inhabitants, as it is said (Num. 33:52), 'And you shall dispossess all the inhabitants of the Land before you, and destroy them, etc.' And if you do not dispossess them (Num. 33:56), 'it shall be that as I planned to do to them, I will do to you.' And if you do not accept [this commandment], the waters will come and wash over you." When they were still in the Jordan, Joshua said to them, "And each man among you shall lift one stone onto your shoulders, corresponding to the number of tribes of the Children of Israel" (Josh. 4:5), "And you shall rest them, etc." (Josh. 4:3), "beneath the spot where the priests' feet [had stood]" (Josh. 4:9), as a sign for the children that their forefathers had crossed through the Jordan. When they were still in the Jordan, Joshua said to them (Josh. 4:3), "Pick up twelve stones for yourselves from here, within the Jordan, from beneath the spot where the priests' feet [had stood]." Rabbi Yehuda says, Rabbi Halafta and Elazar ben Matya and Chananiah ben Chachinai (alt., "Chinai (see Lieberman)) stood on the same stones, and weighed each and every one, [and found that] they each had a weight of forty seahs. From here you can estimate how much the grapes [taken back by the spies] weighed. And as soon as the last one who was among the Israelites ascended from the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, as it is said (Josh. 4:18), "And the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and they flowed like previous day and the day before that, over the entire riverbed."  It turns out that Israel was on one side, and the Ark and its bearers were on one side, the Ark was carried by its bearers, and they brought it across the Jordan.
It comes out that you can say there were three sets of stones: One that Moses erected on the banks of the Jordan River on the Plains of Moab (Deut. 27:2), and one that was under the feet of the priests [in the middle of the Jordan] (Josh. 4:3), and one that they brought over with them (Josh. 4:5).
Rabbi Yehuda says, on the stones of the Altar they (i.e., the words of the Torah) were written. They said to him, how then did the idolaters<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "the nations of the world" (Lieberman)</i> learn the Torah<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., considering that the stones of the Altar were plastered over, which would obscure any writing (see Sot. 35b:4)</i>? He said to them, it teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, placed it in the heart of all the nations and kingdoms, and they sent their watchmen, and they removed the writing from atop the stones in the seventy languages. That very hour, He sealed the sentence of the nations to descend to the pit of destruction. Rabbi Shimon says, on top of the plaster [covering the stones] he wrote it. How so? For he recognized them (i.e., the watchmen), and he plastered it with plaster, and he wrote on it all the words of the Torah in seventy languages, but he wrote it from below, as it says (Deut. 20:17), "In order that they not teach you [to do like all their abominations], etc." [It thus can be derived that] "if you (i.e., the nations) would have repented, we would have accepted you."
Come and see how many miracles were performed for Israel on the same day: They crossed over the waters of the Jordan. And they came to Mount Gerizim and to Mount Ebal, which are in Samaria, which is in the vicinity of Shechem, which is by the terebinth of Moreh, as it is said (Deut. 11:30), "Are they not across the Jordan, along the path of the setting sun...?" [That is] more than sixty <i>mil</i>, and not a single man could stand before them. And anyone who [tried to] stand before them was immediately struck with diarrhea, as it is said (Ex. 23:27), "I will send my terror before you, and will discomfit all the people that you encounter, etc." And it says (Ex. 15:16), "Terror and fear will fall upon them, etc., until your people have passed through" -- that is the first coming. "Until the people who you have acquired have passed through" (ibid.) -- that is the second coming. It may be said that from that point forward, the Israelites were worthy of miracles being performed for them, just in the way it was performed on the sea [of reeds]; however, they sinned. And afterwards they brought the stones and built the Altar, and sacrificed burnt offerings and peace offerings upon it, and they sat and ate and drank, and they carried the stones and came and slept in their place, as it is said (Josh 4:3), "And carry them across with you, and lay them down in the lodging place." You might say that this refers to <i>any</i> lodging place, thus the verse states (ibid.), "in the lodging-place in which you spend the night." And it is said (Josh. 4:20), "and those twelve stones [that they took from the Jordan, Joshua erected in Gilgal]." Thus, you learn that in Gilgal they were erected.
How did Israel recite the blessings and the curses? Six tribes ascended to the top of Mount Gerizim, and six tribes ascended to the top of Mount Ebal. The priests and the Levites and the Ark stood below in the middle [of the two mountains]. The priests circled the Ark and the Levites circled the priests, and Israel was on both sides, as it is said (Josh. 8:33), "All of Israel and its Elders [... stood on either side of the Ark]." What does the verse come to teach? That half of [the people] were in front of Mount Gerizim, and half of [the people] were in front of Mount Ebal. It teaches that the emissaries of Mount Gerizim were more numerous than the emissaries of Mount Ebal, because some of the tribe of Levi were below. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says, it is impossible to say that "Levi were below," for it already says, "Levi were on top" (see Deut. 27:12) and it is impossible to say "Levi were on top," for it already says, "Levi were below." It means that from that moment, the Elders of the priesthood and the Levites were below, and the remainder were above. Rebbi says, those who were worthy of ministering stood below, and those who were not worthy of ministering stood above. They turned their faces toward Mount Gerizim and opened with a blessing. "Blessed be the man who does not make a graven or molten image." "An abomination to God is one who makes [a carved or molten image] by the hands of an artisan" (Deut. 27:15). And these ones and those ones would answer, "Amen!" They then turned around to face Mount Ebal and opened with a curse (ibid.), "Cursed be the man who makes [a carved or molten image], etc." And these ones and those ones would say, "Amen!" They then turned around to face Mount Gerizim, and began with blessings, "Blessed be one who upholds the words of the Torah" (see Deut. 27:26). Then toward Mount Ebal, they began, "Cursed be the one who does not uphold the words of the Torah, etc." (ibid.). "Cursed" -- that is a general curse and a specific curse, to learn and to teach, to safeguard and to perform. § [Each commandment consists of] four [general aspects] by four [specific aspects, adding up to eight]. Behold, eight [blessings] and eight [curses add up to sixteen]. Behold, sixteen by sixteen, and three covenants<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>בריתות</b>, not <b>כריתות</b> ("punishments of excision") (see Lieberman here; accord Sot. 37b:1)</i> applicable to each and every one of them, behold, [result in] forty-eight covenants, and so too on the Plains of Moab. Rabbi Shimon excludes the those of Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, and includes those of the Tent of Meeting. And you cannot find a single matter as to which forty-eight covenants were not forged. Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda of K'far Akko says in the name of Rabbi Shimon, you cannot find a single matter in the Torah as to which five hundred three thousand, five hundred and fifty (503,550)<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">per Lieberman, although the manuscripts and printed text state "503,550," the text should properly read "603,550," consistent with Ex. 38:26 and the response of Rebbi below (and see GR"A (same))</i> covenants [were not forged], the same as [the number of] those who went out from Egypt. Said Rebbi, if [the calculation is to be made] according to the words of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda of K'far Akko, who said in the name of Rabbi Shimon, "you cannot find a single matter in the Torah as to which thirteen<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>שלש עשרה</b>; per Lieberman, the text should properly read "sixteen" (<b>שש עשרה</b>)</i> covenants were not forged, each one of them consisting of six hundred and three thousand, five hundred and fifty (603,550)."

Chapter 9

It comes out that on the other side of the Jordan they would break the necks [of calves], as it is said (Deut. 21:1), "If there is found a corpse, etc." which comes to include [the land] across the Jordan. Rabbi Elazar says, with all of them (i.e. all cases involving an unknown killer), if there was a corpse, they would break the neck. Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda said to him, I only have one who was strangled and cast into a field, lest they would break the neck. Therefore it says, "a corpse." If so, why does it [also] say "fallen [in the field]?" Rather, that even [regarding] one who was killed and hung from a tree, they would not break the neck. One who was found in the entrance to the city, they would not break the neck<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "they would measure" (Lieberman)</i>, for the law demands an act of measuring.
How did they do it? The agents of the Beit Din would go out and collect evidence, and investigate, and bury him, and mark the spot, until they would come to the great Beit Din<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">לבית דין הגדול (Lieberman)</i> that was in the Chamber of Hewn Stone, and they would measure it.
[If a body] was found close to the border in a city inhabited by idolaters, or a city without a court [of 23 judges]: If it was a city inhabited by idolaters between them, or [if it was] close to Jerusalem, they would not measure; rather they leave it (i.e., the city) aside and measure outside of it (see Sotah 49b:9).
The place where [the calf whose neck is broken] falls and its surroundings, behold, they are forbidden [for work to be performed]. What is the measure of the "surroundings." Forty [cubits]. Rebbi says, fifty cubits.
The Elders say (Deut. 21:7), "Our hands did not spill this blood, and our eyes did not see." The priests say (Deut. 21:8), "Absolve Your people Israel that You redeemed, O God, etc." And the Holy Spirit says, "And they shall be absolved of the blood." Three utterances, [and] whoever said this did not say that. Similarly, you could say [that in connection with the spies' report] (Num. 13:27-28), "We came to the land where you sent us," said Joshua; Caleb said; "Let us go up and possess it"; the [other] spies said, "However, powerful are the people settled in the land." Three utterances, this next to that, [and] whoever said this did not say that. Similarly, you could say [regarding the matter of Judah and Tamar] (Gen. 38:25-26), "And she said, 'Pray recognize, to whom does this seal [and these cords and this staff] belong?,'" said Tamar; "She is more righteous than I," said Judah; and the Holy Spirit says, "And he did not know her again." Three [utterances], this next to that, [and] whoever said this did not say that, and whoever said that did not say the other. Similarly, you could say [regarding the battle of Shiloh] (I Sam. 4:8-9), "Woe to us! Who will save us from the hand of this mighty God?" said the righteous among them; the evil ones among them said, "These are the gods who struck [the Egyptians] with ten plagues, and they paid for His plagues in the desert"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>אלה הם האלים המכים עשר מכות, ושלמו מכותיו במדבר</b> (following Lieberman)</i>; and the brave ones among them said, "Gird yourselves and be like men, O Philistines!" Three utterances, this next to that, etc. Similarly, you can say [regarding Sisera's mother awaiting his return] (Judges 5:28-31), "Through the window she gazed, etc.," said the mother of Sisera; "The wisest of her ladies-in-waiting [answered her], etc."; "Can they not be found dividing up the spoils, etc.?", "Thus may all Your enemies perish, O God, etc.," said the Holy Spirit. Three utterances, this next to that, etc. Similarly, you can say (Jer. 26:18-24): "Micah the Morashite would prophesize in the days of Hezekiah, King of Judah." And what would he prophesize? "And he said to all the people of Judah, saying, 'Thus said the Lord of Hosts: Zion will be a plowed field, and Jerusalem will be a heap of ruins, and the Temple Mount will be like the [idolatrous] high-places in the forest.' And did Hezekiah the King of Judah and all of Judah put him to death? And did he not he fear God, and beseech the face of God, and God repented of the evil that he had spoken about them? And shall we cause such a great evil to be done to our souls?" Thus said the upright people among them. And the evildoers among them said, "And there was also a man prophesying in the name of God, Uriah ben Shemayah from Kiryat HaY'arim, and he prophesied about this land and this city, the same as all the words of Jeremiah. And King Jehoiakim and all his mighty men and all the people heard his words and the King sought to kill him. And Uriah heard and was afraid and fled and came to Egypt, and King Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt; Elnatan ben Achbor and other men with him [went] to Egypt. And they took Uriah from Egypt and brought him to King Jehoiakim, and he had him cut down by the sword, and he threw his carcass into the burial pit of the common people." They said, just like Uriah prophesized and was killed, so too Jeremiah must be killed, as it is said, "But the hand of Achikam ben Shafan was on Jeremiah [protecting him] so that he could not be given into the hands of the people to kill him." This entire section is a mixture of utterances, and the one who said this did not say that. Similarly, you can say (Nahum 1:1-4), "An oracle against the people of Nineveh, a book of prophecy of Nahum the Elkoshite: The Lord is a jealous and vengeful God, vengeful, etc."; "God is slow to anger, and of great forbearance, etc."; "He rebukes the sea, etc." This entire section is a mixture of utterances, and the one who said this did not say that. Similarly, you can say (Ps. 58:1-2), "For the conductor, on the <i>tashchet</i>, of David, a <i>michtam</i>: Do you truly speak righteously, etc."; "Even in your heart you plot wickedness, etc."; "The wicked are estranged from the womb, etc." This entire section is a mixture of utterances, and the one who said this did not say that. Similarly, you can say (Songs 8:5-6), "Under the apple tree I roused you," said the Holy Spirit; "Set me as a a seal upon your heart," said the Congregation of Israel; "For love is as powerful as death," said the idolaters. Three utterances, this next to that, etc.

Chapter 10

When the righteous come into the world, good comes into the world [with them], and divine retribution is removed from the world, and when they pass away from the world, divine retribution comes into the world, and good is removed from the world. When the evildoers come into the world, divine retribution comes into the world [with them], and good is removed from the world, and when they are removed from the world (i.e., when they die), good comes to the world and divine retribution is removed from the world. And from where is it derived that when the righteous come into the world, good comes  into the world [with them] and divine retribution is removed from the world? As it is said (Gen. 5:29<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Note: Tanakh translations in this chapter generally follow JPS, 1985</i>), "And [Lemekh] called his name Noah, saying, this one will bring us comfort from our labors, [from the ... ground, which God has cursed]." And from where is it derived that when they pass away from the world, divine retribution comes into the world and good is removed from the world? As it is said (Is. 57:1), "A righteous person perishes, and no one considers [... that because of evil the righteous one was taken away]," and it says (Is. 57:3) "But as for you, come closer, you children of a sorceress, you offspring of an adulterer, etc." And from where is it derived that when the evildoers come into the world, divine retribution comes to the world [with them] and good is removed from the world? As it is said (Prov. 18:3), "With the wicked man comes derision [and with the rogue, contempt]." And from where is it derived that when [the evildoers] are removed from this world, good comes into the world and divine retribution is removed from the world? As it is said (Prov. 11:10), "And when the wicked perish there are shouts of joy," and it says (Deut. 13:18), "In order that the Lord may turn from His blazing anger [and show you compassion]." Whenever there are evildoers in the world, there is "blazing anger" in the world, [but] when they have perished from the world, blazing anger is removed from world. And it is not that the righteous suspend the world with their lives alone, but also with their deaths, as it is said (Gen. 7:10), "And it was on the seventh day that the waters of the Flood [came upon the earth]." And what was the good of those seven days? So that [during] those seven days, they could mourn over Methuselah the Righteous, which held back the divine punishment [of the Flood] from coming onto the earth, and thus it is said, "And it was on the seventh day..." Another version: What was the good of those seven days? It teaches that the Place gave them seven days even after the decree, on the possibility that they would repent.  And [clearly] they did not did so, as it is said, "And it was on the seventh day..." Another version: "And it was on the seventh day" -- what was the good of those seven days? It teaches that the Place altered the Order of Creation during them, and the sun rose in the west and set in the east. And thus it is said, "And it was on the seventh day..." Another version: What was the good of those seven days? It teaches that the Place gave them seven days of food and drink, and they sat and they ate and they drank, and [in that way] he showed them a small taste (מעין) of the World [to Come]. And why all of this? So that they would see, and recognize, and know what they had lost.
As long as Abraham was alive, there was plenty, as it is said (Gen. 24:1), "And God had blessed Abraham in everything." Once Abraham died, "There was a famine in the land" (Gen. 26:1). Isaac came and [again] there was plenty, as it says (Gen 26:12), "Isaac sowed in that land [and reaped in that year a hundred measures]." As long as Abraham was alive, the wells were filled with water, [but] once Abraham died what does it say, but (Gen. 26:15), "And all the wells which had been dug [by the servants of his (i.e., Isaac's) father in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines stopped up and filled with earth]." They said, since they are no longer filled with water, they will be a hazard should we stumble into them, and thus they filled them up. Isaac came and [again] the wells were filled with water, as it is said (Gen. 26:18-19), "And Isaac again dug up the wells of water, etc." and "[Isaac's] servants [also] dug, etc."
As long as Isaac was alive, the seeds were blessed, as it is said (Gen. 26:12), "And Isaac sowed in that land [and reaped in that year a hundred measures; thus did God bless him]." Before Jacob descended to Aram of Two-Rivers (Gen. 24:10), the house of Laban the Aramean was not blessed, as it says (Gen. 30:30), "For you had few before me, and they have since burst out into a multitude, and God has blessed you at my [every] step." And it says (Gen. 30:27), "[Laban said] ... I have become wealthy, and God has blessed me on account of you." Before Joseph descended to Egypt, the house of Potiphar was not blessed. Once he descended, what does it say, but (Gen. 39:5), "And God blessed the house of the Egyptian because of Joseph." Before Jacob descended to Egypt [after Joseph sent for him], there was famine, as it says (Gen. 45:6), "For it is two years now that the famine has been in the midst of the land, etc." Once he descended, what does it say, but (Gen. 50:31), "And now, do not fear, for I will sustain you and your little children, etc." It says here "sustain," and it says there (Gen. 45:11) "sustain," just as "sustain" over there is in reference to the famine, so too "sustain" over here is in reference to the famine. As long as Joseph and the tribes (i.e., his brothers) were alive, Israel comported itself with grandeur and honor, as it is said (Ex. 1:7), "And the Children of Israel bore fruit and swarmed, etc." Once he died, what does it say, but (Ex. 1:6-9), "And Joseph died[, and all his brothers, and all that generation]," "And a new king arose [over Egypt]," "And he said to his people, [Here this people ... is greater and mightier [in number] than we]," "Come  now, let us use our wits against it, etc."

Chapter 11

As long as Miriam was alive, there was a well that sustained Israel. Once Miriam died, what does it say, but (Num. 20:1-2), "Miriam died there ... And there was no water for the community," [meaning] that the well had disappeared. As long as Aaron was alive, the column of cloud guided Israel. Once Aaron died, what does it say, but (Num. 21:1), "And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who ruled the Negev, heard [that Israel was coming]." That same evildoer raised an army and came to wage war with Israel. He said, "Where has their advance guard (התייר)  gone, the one who was subduing the land for them?"
As long as Moses was alive, the manna was falling for Israel. Once Moses died, what does it say, but (Josh. 5:12), "And the manna ceased the next day." And it was not that the manna depended on him being alive, but rather even after his death, the manna that they gathered on the day that Moses died, they ate from it, from the 7th of Adar until the 16th of Nissan, thirty-nine days. And they offered up the Omer in Gilgal, as it is said (Ex. 16:35), "And the Children of Israel ate the manna for 40 years, until they came (עד בואם) to settled land." Is it not already written "until they came (עד בואם)"? Why is written (in the same verse), "[they ate manna] until they came (עד בואם) to the border of the land of Canaan"? Rather, it comes to teach that from the manna that they gathered on the day that Moses died, they ate from it from the 7th of Adar until the 16th of Nissan, 39 days. Until they offered up the Omer in Gilgal, the manna did not cease to exist, and [while they still had it] they did not want to eat from the produce of the land of Canaan. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah told a parable: To what is this matter comparable? To a king of flesh and blood that said to his servant, "Mix me [a cup of wine] in hot water" (see Zev. 82a:5). He said to him, "There is no hot water here." He said to him, "If not, mix it for me in cold water." In order to make it known how wonderful the manna was for Israel, that as long as it descended for Israel they would not eat from the produce of the land of Canaan. The year that Israel went out from Egypt, [starting] on the 16th of Iyar, manna descended for Israel, and on the 7th of Adar it ceased descending, on the same day that Moses died.  And on the 16th of Nissan, the manna that they had kept in their hands was finished, as it is said (Josh. 5:12, JPS Tr.), "[The Israelites got no more manna] and that year they ate of the yield of the land of Canaan." Another version: Why does it say (Ex. 16:35), "And the Children of Israel ate the manna for forty years"? Is it not missing forty days (i.e., from the 7th of Adar until the 16th of Nissan)? Rather, that they ate cakes of matzah that they brought out in their hands from Egypt, which were just as good as manna for them.
And from where is it derived that Moses was born on the 7th of Adar? As it is said (Deut. 31:2), "And he said to them, I am 120 years old today," As there is [apparently] no need for the verse to state "today" (i.e., it could simply have said, "I am 120 years old"), what does "today" come to teach? That "today," his years became complete. Another version: What does "today" come to teach? It teaches that 120 years are precisely calculated from day to day. Another version, what does "today" come to teach? That the Holy One Blessed be He fulfills that which he gives to the righteous with goodwill and with happiness, as it is said (Ex. 23:26), "The number of your days I will complete." And from where is it derived that Moses died on the 7th of Adar? As it is said (Ex. 34:8), "And the Children of Israel wept over Moses in the Plains of Moab for thirty days, etc." And (Josh. 1:1), "And it was after the death of Moses, the servant of God, etc." And (Josh. 1:2) "Now arise and cross [the Jordan]." And (Josh. 1:10-11) "Joshua gave orders to the officers of the people, Pass through the camp [and instruct the people ... to be prepare to cross the Jordan in three days]." And it says (Josh. 4:19), "And the people arose from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, etc." Count backwards 33 [days] from that point (i.e., the 10th of Nissan), and it comes out that Moses died on the 7th of Adar.
Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda says, as soon as Israel left Egypt, they were appointed three worthy leaders, and they are Moses, and Aaron, and Miriam. Due to their merit, they were apportioned three gifts: The well, the column of cloud, and the manna. The  well was due to the merit of Miriam, the column of cloud was due to the merit of Aaron, and the manna was due to the merit of Moses. When Miriam died, the well ceased to exist, but it was returned [to them] due to the merit of Moses and Aaron. When Aaron died, the column of cloud ceased to exist, but it was returned [to them] due to the merit of Moses. When Moses died, all three of them ceased to exist, and they were not returned [to them], as it is said (Zech. 11:8), "But I lost the three shepherds in one month, etc." And the hornet [that God had promised to send along with them to expel the Canaanites (Deut. 7:20)] did not cross the Jordan with them, rather, it stood on the banks of the Jordan and hurled its venom at them.
As long as Joshua and the Elders were alive, there did not exist among the Children of Israel anyone who called upon [idols], and idol worshippers never did damage to the Israelites, as it is said (Judges 2:7), "And the people served God all the days of Joshua and all the days of the Elders who continued living after Joshua." Once Joshua and the Elders died, what does it say, but (Judges 3:8), "And the Children of Israel served Cushan-Rishataim [the King of Aram] for eight years." Why was his name "Rishataim" (literally, "twice evil")? Because he performed two evil deeds. First, he subjugated Israel, and second, he desecrated his oath (see Sanh. 105a:8).
As long as Samuel was alive, the Philistines fell under the hand of Israel, as it is said (1 Sam. 7:13), "And the hand of God was against the Philistines as long as Samuel was alive." Once Samuel died, what does it say, but (1 Sam. 25:1), "And died Samuel [and all Israel gathered and mourned him]," and (1 Sam. 28:1), "[It was in those days that] the Philistines gathered their forces to wage war with Israel."<br>[Relatedly,] in one [place] it is written (1 Sam. 28:3), "And <i>Samuel died</i> [and all Israel mourned him]." And it is [also] written (1 Sam. 25:1), "And <i>died Samuel</i>, etc." Rather, "Samuel died" --  this is his actual death; "And died Samuel" -- this refers to the matter of Saul. Rabbi Eliezer says, behold, it says (1 Sam. 28:14, in the encounter of King Saul and the Witch of Endor), "And [Saul] said to her, 'What is his appearance?' And she said, 'An old man is rising up.'" So that it would not enter your mind that Samuel did not [actually] die; rather, he was [indeed] dead. And it says (1 Sam. 28:3), "And all Israel mourned him, and he was buried in 'Ramah', in his [home] town." And thus, we are not being informed that "Ramah" is his [home] town; rather, it teaches that all Israel mourned him, and that the manner of their mourning was "Ramah" (i.e., exalted).
Similarly, you can say (1 Samuel 10:2), "When you leave me today, you will meet two men near Rachel's tomb, at Zelzah on the border of Benjamin." But haven't we learned that Rachel was buried in Bethlehem (her portion) of Judah, as it says (Genesis 35:19), "Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem)." And Ephrath is none other than Judah's portion, as it says (Micah 5:1), "But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah..." Rather, Samuel told Saul, "Now that I am speaking to you, you will go and find them near Rachel's tomb, and they will tell you that she is buried on the border of Benjamin, at Zelzah."<br> Similarly, it says (1 Samuel 22:6), "Now Saul was sitting under a tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah, with his spear in his hand, and all his officials were standing around him." If Saul was in Gibeah, then how could he be in Ramah, and if he was in Ramah, how could he be in Gibeah? Rather, it was the court of Samuel the Ramathite that made Saul's throne stable in Gibeah. Similarly, it says (Psalm 122:2), "Our feet are standing in your gates, Jerusalem." Can it really be said that our feet are only standing in the gates of Jerusalem? Rather, it is the courts of David that stand in the gates of Jerusalem.<br> Similarly, it says (Zech. 14:10), "The whole land, from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem, will become like the Arabah." But wasn't the area south of Jerusalem already a plain, and Geba and Rimmon hilly regions? Rather, just as Geba and Rimmon are destined to become a plain opposite Jerusalem, so too all lands are destined to become a plain opposite Jerusalem.
Similarly, you can say (2 Sam. 21:8), "And the five sons of Michal daughter of Saul that she bore to Adriel [son of Barzilai] the Mecholatite, etc." Here we find that [Saul] gave Michal to Adriel the Mecholatite. But did he not give her, rather, to Palti son of Laish from Gallim? For it says (1 Sam. 25:44), "And Saul gave Michal his daughter, the wife of David, to Palti son of Laish." Rather, the marriage of Michal is juxtaposed to the marriage of Merav (see 1 Sam. 18:19). Just as the marriage of Merav [was consummated] through sin, so too the marriage of Michal to Palti ben Laish [was consummated] through sin.
The students of Rabbi Yosei asked, How could David have married the sister of his wife (i.e., in apparent violation of Torah law, see Lev. 18:18)? He said to them, it was [only] after the death of Merav that he married [Michal]. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karcha says, [the reason is that] their betrothal was not fully valid, as it is said (2 Sam. 3:14), "[And David sent messengers to Ish-boshet son of Saul, saying,] 'Give me my wife, Michal, for whom I paid the marriage-price [of one hundred Philistine foreskins].'" Just as their betrothal was not fully valid<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">the implication is that one hundred foreskins are worthless, and thus do not effect a valid kiddushin (see Kidd. 1:1)</i>, so too their marriage was not fully valid. [Relatedly,] on one [place] it says (2 Sam.  21:8), "And the five sons of Michal daughter of Saul that she bore to Adriel [son of Barzilai] the Mecholatite," and [elsewhere] it is written (2 Sam. 6:23), "And Michal daughter of Saul had no offspring until the day of her death." How could these two [apparently contradictory] verses remain standing? It was said, until now, they were [considered] the sons of Merav. Merav bore them, but Michal raised them, and [therefore] they were called by her name. As it says (Ruth 4:17, regarding Ruth's son Oved), "And the neighbors gave him a name, saying, 'A son is born to <i>Naomi</i>,'" and it says (Num. 3:1, prior to listing Aaron's descendants), "And these are the generations of <i>Moses</i>, etc." 

Chapter 12

[It is stated]: "In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Ba'asha, king of Israel, rose up against Judah, and he built 'the Heights' (<i>HaRama</i>) [in order to prevent Asa, king of Judah, from coming or going]" (2 Chr. 16:1). It is impossible to say this! Didn't Asa bury Ba'asha in the twenty-sixth year of his reign (see 1 Kings 16:5-7)? What "the thirty-sixth year" comes to teach is that is compared to the thirty-six years in which Solomon aligned himself in marriage with the King of Egypt (1 Kings 3:1); and compared to the thirty-six years in which a decree was instituted against the kingship of the House of David, that the kingdom of David would be divided (cf. Shab. 113b:10), but that in a future era it would return to them (i.e., the kingdom would be reunited); and compared to the thirty-six years that a decree was imposed on the kings of Aram that they would be hostile to Israel, but that in a future era they would fall to the House of David. Therefore, it says "in the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa."
[It is stated]: "And [King Ahaziah] died according to the word of God, which Elijah had spoken.... And Jehoram [his brother] reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah [for he did not have a son]" (2 Kings 1:17). Is it possible to say this? For was Jehoshaphat not king after him for five years (see 2 Kings 8:16)? Rather, as soon as Jehoshaphat king of Judah went with Ahab king of Israel to Ramot Gilead, a decree was instituted against Jehoshaphat to be killed, as it is said (1 Kings 22:32, JPS Tr.), " And when the chariot officers saw Jehoshaphat [whom they took for the king of Israel, they turned upon him to attack him, and Jehoshaphat cried out]." He was fit to be killed at that very moment; rather, it teaches that due to the merit of the cry that he cried out, the sentence was suspended for him seven years, and they were counted toward his son.
[It is stated]: "Jehoram was thirty-two years old in [the beginning of] his reign, and for eight years he was king in Jerusalem" (2 Chr. 21:5). And regarding Ahaziah his son, what does it say, but (2 Chr. 22:2), "Ahaziah was forty-two years old in [the beginning of] his reign, and for one year he was king in Jerusalem." And in another place it says (2 Kings 8:26), "Ahaziah was twenty-two years old in [the beginning of] his reign." Said Rabbi Yosei: And how is it possible for a son to be two years (שתי שנים, see MS Vienna) older than his father? Rather, as soon as Asa king of Judah married the daughter of Omri king of Israel to Jehoshaphat his son, it was decreed on the kingship of [the House of] David, that it would terminated with the House of Ahab, as it is said (2 Chr. 22:7): "And God brought about the downfall of Ahaziah [for visiting Joram, and during his visit, he went out with Jehoram to Jehu son of Nimsi, who God had anointed to cut off the House of Ahab.]" And the two of them fell that same day -- the one with the other.
And similarly [it says], "All adduced their genealogies in the days of Yotham, king of Judah, and in the days of Yeravam, king of Israel" (1 Chr. 5:17, JPS Tr.). Is it possible to say this? Did not Uzziah bury Yeravam, and another three kings after him? Rather, all of these twenty-five years that Uzziah ruled he was a leper (2 Chr. 26:21), "and Yotham his son [ruled] over the house of the king [and] judged the people of the land."
Before Elijah was taken away, the Holy Spirit was abundant among Israel, as it is said (2 Kings 2:2, JPS Tr.), "Elijah said to Elisha, 'Stay here, for the Lord has sent me on to Bethel.'" What does it say (2 Kings 2:3), "The sons of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha, etc." [Then] what does it say (2 Kings 2:5-6), "And the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho approached [Elisha], etc." [and Elijah said to Elisha], "Because the Lord has sent me to the Jordan."  [Then] what does it say (2 Kings 2:7), "And fifty men from the sons of the prophets went and stood across from him from afar and the two of them (Elijah and Elisha) stood by the Jordan." One might think that this was because they were few, and thus it comes to teach, "And fifty men, etc." One might think that they were small (i.e., insignificant), and thus it comes to teach (2 Kings 2:5), "And they said to him, 'Did you know that today Hashem is taking your master [from you]?'" It does not say "<i>our</i> master"; rather, it says "<i>your</i> master." It teaches that they were all friends of Elijah, and all of them had the same worth as Elijah. And from where is it derived that the Holy Spirit was removed from them? As it is said (2 Kings 2:16), "And they said to him, 'Now, if you please, your servant has fifty valiant men. [They will go and search for your master, lest the Spirit of God has taken him away, and cast him onto one of the mountains, or into one of the valleys.]'" Is it possible for a human being, the night before, to say "Did you know that today Hashem is taking your master," and now they say, "They will go and search for your master"? Rather, it teaches that the Holy Spirit was hidden from them. "And they pressed him until he was ashamed" (2 Kings 2:17) -- what does "until he was ashamed" come to teach? It is as if to say that he was ashamed on account of them, lest they say that he did not wish to go and meet his master. As long as Elisha lived, the bands of Aramean raiders did not [cross] the border of Israel, as it says (2 Kings 6:23, JPS Tr.), "And the Aramean bands stopped invading the land of Israel." Once Elisha died and they had buried him, the bands of Moabite [and Aramean] raiders invaded the land of Israel (see 2 Kings 24:2).

Chapter 13

Once the First Temple was built, the Tent of Meeting was hidden away, and hidden along with it were its boards, its clasps, and its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets. And nevertheless, they would only use the table [for the showbread] that Moses made, and the candelabra that Moses made. [The candelabra] did not require anointing oil, for the inaugural sanctification sanctified it for that [first] time, and also sanctified it for future eras.
Once the Ark was hidden away, hidden with it was the jar of manna, and the flask of anointing oil, and the staff of Aaron [and] its almonds and its blossoms, and the chest that the Philistines sent as a gift to the God of Israel. All of these had been in the Holy of Holies in the Temple. And once the Ark was hidden away, its vessels were hidden [along] with it. And who hid it away? Josiah the king hid it away. What did he see [that caused him to hide it]? It was because he saw written in the Torah (Deut. 28:36), "Hashem will drive away you and your king, etc." He appointed Levites and they hid it, as it is said (2 Chron. 35:3), "He said to the Levites, who taught all of Israel, who were holy to Hashem: 'Put the Holy Ark in the Temple that Solomon, king of Israel, built. You need not carry it on your shoulders any longer.'" He said to them, "Hide it away, so that it not be taken up to Babylonia like the rest of the vessels, so that it may be restored to its place [in the future]," as it is said (ibid.), "Now serve Hashem your God, and His people Israel," [and thus] they immediately hid it away. Rabbi Eliezer says, [rather,] the Ark was exiled to Babylonia, as it is said (2 Kings 20:17), "[Behold, days are coming when all that is in your house, and all the treasures that your fathers have stored up until today, will be carried away to Babylonia]; not a thing (<i>davar</i>) will remain, said Hashem." And there is no <i>davar</i> but the <i>dibrot</i> (i.e., the Commandments, see Avot D'Rabbi Natan 41:12) that are in it. Rabbi Shimon says, behold, it says (2 Chron. 36:10, JPS tr.), "At the turn of the year, King Nebuchadnezzar sent to have him brought to Babylonia with the precious vessels of the House of the Lord [etc.]" -- that is the Ark. Rabbi Yehudah ben Lakish says, the Ark was hidden in its place, as it is said (1 Kings 8:8), "And the poles [of the Ark] projected out, [and the ends of the poles] were seen [from the sanctuary in front of the Holy, but they were not seen from the outside]; and they remain there until this day."
Once the Holy Temple was destroyed, the kingship of the House of David ceased and the the Urim and Tummim ceased, and the [Levitical] cities with fields ceased to exist. As it is said (Ezra 2:63), "And the Tisharta (i.e., the Persian governor of Judea) told them not to partake of the most holy things until a Kohen with the Urim and Tummim was installed." This can be likened to a person who says to his fellow, "Until the dead are resurrected or until Elijah comes."
From the time that the last prophets -- Chaggai, Zechariah, and Malachi -- died, the Holy Spirit ceased to exist among Israel. And nevertheless, they would avail themselves of the Divine Voice (<i>bat kol</i>, lit. "Daughter of the Voice"). It so happened that the Sages entered the upper chamber of Ben Guriya in Jericho, and a Divine Voice issued, and it said to them, "There is a man here among you who is worthy of the Holy Spirit, only that his generation does not merit it." They cast their eyes on Hillel the Elder. And at the time of his death, they would say, "Alas, humble one, alas, righteous one, disciple of Ezra."
It once happened that the Sages had arrived in Yavneh and a Divine Voice went out and it said to them, "There is here a man who is worthy of the Holy Spirit, but his generation does not merit it." They cast their eyes on Hillel the Elder. And when he died, they said, "Alas, humble one, alas, righteous one, disciple of Ezra." Another time they were reclining in Yavneh, and they heard a Divine Voice saying, "There is here a man who is worthy of the Holy Spirit being upon him, but his generation does not merit it," and they cast their eyes on Shmuel HaKatan. And when he died, they would say, "Alas, humble one, alas, righteous one, disciple of Hillel the Elder." And even he (i.e., Shmuel HaKatan) said at the time of his death, "Shimon [the Righteous] and Yishmael [the High Priest] are destined to die, and the rest of their colleagues [are destined] for the sword, and the rest of the people to plunder, and great strife will ensue." And afterwards a judgment [was announced] in the Aramaic language, saying, "Even regarding Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava it is decreed that they will say of him, 'Alas, humble one, alas, righteous one, disciple of Shmuel HaKatan,'" but the opportunity was torn from them (since Yehuda ben Bava was executed by the government, see San. 11a:9).
Yochanan the High Priest heard a voice [emerging] from the Holy of Holies (in Aramaic): "The youth who went to wage war in Antokhya have been victorious" (Sot. 33a:8, Steinsaltz tr.). And the people wrote down the exact hour and the exact day [that the voice was heard], and it matched the exact hour that they were victorious. And Shimon the Righteous heard a voice from the Holy of Holies (in Aramaic): "The decree that the enemy intended to bring against the Temple is annulled, and Gaskalgas (i.e., Caligula), has been killed and his decrees have been voided" (ibid.). And in the Aramaic language was it heard.
As long as Shimon the Righteous was alive, the western lamp was constant (i.e., continuously burning), [but] when he died, they went and found that it was extinguished. From then on, sometimes they found it extinguished, and sometimes they found it burning. As long as Shimon the Righteous was alive, the pile of wood [on the Altar] was constant. After they had arranged it in the morning, it kept going strongly the entire day, and they would offer up their daily offerings, and their additional offerings, and their libations, and they would not need to add [wood] to it except for the two logs of wood of the daily afternoon offering, in order to fulfill the mitzva of the wood, as it is said (Lev. 6:5), "And the Kohen shall kindle [logs on it every morning]." Once Shimon the Righteous died, the strength of the pile of wood grew weaker, such that after they had arranged it in the morning, they could not avoid replenishing wood on it the entire day. As long as Shimon the Righteous was alive, a blessing accompanied the two loaves [of the Omer] and the showbread. The two loaves were divided on Shavuot for the Kohanim, and the showbread on the Festival to all the men of the watch. And there were those of them who would eat and be satisfied, and there were those who would eat and leave some over, and only an olive's-bulk would come up into each of their hands. Once Shimon the Righteous died, a blessing no longer accompanied the two loaves or the showbread. The modest ones would withdraw their hands, and the gluttons would split it amongst themselves, yet only a bean's-bulk would come up into each of their hands. It so happened with one Kohen from Tzippori (Sepphoris) that he took his portion as well as his fellow's portion, and even though only a bean's bulk came up into his head, they would call him Ben Chamtzan ("Son of Violence"), until today.
The year in which Shimon the Righteous died [he said to them] "in this year I will die" "how do you know this?" they responded. He (Shimon the Righteous) responded: "all of the Yom Kippur days there was an old man dressed in all white who would go with me into the holy of holies and leave with me, on this year he went in with me but did not come out with me." Seven days passed after the holiday and he died. From the time of the death of Rebbi Shimon the Righteous they ceased blessing in the name of Hashem.
The "wakers" (Sot. 9:10) -- these were the Levites, would stand on the platform and say<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>שהיו עומדים על הדוכן ואומרים</b> (GR"A)</i> (Ps. 44:2), "Awake! Why do You slumber, O Lord, etc.?" Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai said to them, "And is there really sleep before Him? And does it not already say (Ps. 121:4), 'Behold, the Guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps!' Rather, whenever [the Children of] Israel are in a state of pain and the idolaters are in a state of ease, thus it may be said<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>כך נאמר</b> (GR"A)</i>, so to speak, 'Awake! Why do You slumber?'" The "knockers" -- these were those who struck<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., <b>שֶׁהָיוּ מְסָרְטִין</b>, "who would scratch" (Sot. 48a:8); alt., <b>שהיו חובטין אותו במקלות</b>, "who would beat it with sticks" (Sot. 48a:9, GR"A)</i> the calf between its horns in the manner of idolaters. Yochanan ben Zakkai said to them, "Until when will you feed <i>tereifot</i> to the Altar?"
"Until his days the hammer would strike in Jerusalem" -- on the intermediate days of a Festival. He even decreed regarding the confession [of tithes] and abolished demai (doubtfully tithed produce).<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "He even <i>abolished</i> the confession [of tithes] and <i>decreed regarding</i> demai" (see Minchat Yitzchak here)</i> For he sent [emissaries] to all the towns of Israel, and they found that [the people] were only separating great terumah (i.e., the priestly portion of untithed produce). First tithe and second tithe -- some of them separated and some of them did not separate. Yochanan the High Priest said to them, since [failure to separate] terumah is a sin punishable by death, and [failure to separate] terumah of tithes is a sin punishable by death, a person will designate terumah and terumah of tithes, and give it to a priest, and will exchange second tithe for money, and as to the remaining tithes and poor tithes, the burden of proof will rest on the claimant.

Chapter 14

Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai says, once murderers proliferated, they abolished the [ritual of] breaking the heifer's neck (Sot. 9:9), because there is no [need to perform the ritual of] breaking the heifer's neck except in a case of doubt. Nowadays, killings have proliferated out in the open.  When adulterers proliferated, they abolished the [ritual of] the bitter waters, for there is no need for the bitter waters except in a case of doubt. Nowadays, there is already an increase in those who are seen [engaging in sexual relations] out in the open. Once bribe-takers proliferated, burning anger came into the world, and honor of the Torah ceased to exist. Once those who whispered surreptitiously (i.e., to influence the judges) in the Beit Din proliferated, the deeds became twisted and the laws became corrupted and the Shekhinah departed from Israel. Once those who looked upon the faces [of litigants] proliferated, the verse (Deut. 1:17) "You shall not regard faces in judgment ... You shall not fear any man [for judgment]" [was fulfilled], and they removed from themselves the yoke of Heaven, and crowned themselves with a yoke of flesh and blood. Once those who force merchandise onto [private] homeowners (i.e., forcing them into being their agents or customers) proliferated, bribery and perversion of justice proliferated, and they (i.e., the Jewish nation) were in the rear and not in the vanguard, and about them it is said, as with the sons of Samuel (1 Sam. 8:3), "His sons did not follow in his ways, etc.," and so too they took bribes and justice was perverted. § Once those who draw out their spittle (i.e., to show arrogance (see Sot. 47b:19 (Steinsaltz)) proliferated, the number of students decreased, and honor for the Torah ceased. Once profit-seekers proliferated (Is. 5:20), "Those who call evil good and good evil" proliferated as well. Once those who call evil good and good evil proliferated, the world became filled with "Woe! Woe!" (ibid.). Once haughty people proliferated, the daughters of Israel began marrying those haughty people, because in our generations, they do not look beyond the surface. Once those with "heads thrown back and roving eyes" (Is. 3:16) proliferated,    the [administration of the] bitter waters proliferated,  but they were sealed up (i.e., as stated byRabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai above). Once boastfulness of the heart proliferated,  disagreement (<i>machloket</i>) proliferated in Israel, and they are the spillers of blood. Once the students of Shammai and of Hillel proliferated, who did not attend [to their masters' teachings] with all their ability, disagreement proliferated in Israel, and the Torah was made into two Torahs. Once those who collect charity from idolaters proliferated, the idolaters lowered themselves and Israelites raised themselves, so to speak (i e., it was actually the opposite), and there is never any respite for Israel.

Chapter 15

From the time that the Temple was destroyed, the <i>shamir</i> ceased to exist, as well as the "sweetness of the honeycomb" (Ps. 19:11). Said Rabbi Yehuda, what was this "<i>shamir</i>"? It was created on the sixth day of creation. When it is placed on top of stones, [or] on top of beams, cuts them opens as though they are two boards of a writing tablet, and not only that, but when it is placed on top of iron, it would split it open from top to bottom (בוקע ויורד), and there was nothing that could withstand it. How did they do it (i.e., restrain it)? They would bind it up in a soft woolen cloth, and place it inside a lead cylinder filled with bran flour. And with it Solomon built the Holy Temple, as it is said (1 Kings 6:7, JPS Tr.), "When the House was built, only finished stones cut at the quarry were used, so that no hammer or ax or any iron tool was heard in the House while it was being built." [These are] the words of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Nehemiah says, they were sawed with saws from the outside, as it is said, (1 Kings 7:9, see Steinsaltz tr.), "All these were costly stones, according to the measures of hewn stones, sawed with saws, from inside (מבית) to outside." What does "from inside to outside" come to teach? That in the Temple they were not heard; rather, they prepared it from the outside and they brought it inside. Said Rebbi, the words of Rabbi Yehuda are preferable to me as to the stones of the Temple, and the words of Rabbi Nehemiah as to the stones of his, (i.e., Solomon's) house (בית).
Said Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel, you should know that the dew has been cursed. For in earlier times, once dew descended on the straw and on the stubble, it whitened it, as it is said (Ex. 16:14), "And behold, on the face of the wilderness, [was something] thin, flaky, [fine as frost upon the land]." And now, it blackens it. In earlier times, in every town that had dew in greater abundance than its neighbors, its produce was abundant [as well]. Now, it is less (i.e., in adverse relation to the amount of dew). Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua: From the day that the Holy Temple was destroyed, there is no day that is not cursed, and dew does not descend as a blessing, and it removes the taste from the produce. And the very first [curse] remains.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the earlier curse is not superseded by the later curse, but rather they accumulate (see Lieberman here)</i> Rabbi Yosei says, [the dew] even removes the cream from the grain. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, purity (i.e., lack of purity) removed the taste and the fragrance [of the produce]. Tithes (i.e., the failure to separate tithes) removed the cream and the storing up of grain<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>הדגן</b>, i.e., the harvest was no longer of sufficient quantity to store up in the granaries (see Lieberman here)</i>. Once Rabbi Eliezer died, honor for the Torah ceased. Once Rabbi Yehoshua died, men of stature ceased, and [worthy] thoughts were cut off from Israel. Once Rabbi Akiva died, the sowing of seeds of Torah ceased, and the fountains of wisdom were sealed off. Once Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah died, the crown of the Sages ceased, for "the crown of the wise is their riches" (Prov. 14:24). Once Ben Azzai died, those who are diligent [in Torah study] ceased. Once Ben Zoma died, those capable of interpreting [the Torah] ceased. Once Rabbi Chaninah ben Dosa died, men of good deeds ceased from Israel. Once Abba Yosei ben Katonot, the man of Katonta, died piety diminished (<i>nit'ketana</i>). Why did they call him by the name "man of Katonta"? Because he was at the "tail end" (<i>kutna</i>) of piety.  Once Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel died, locusts appeared and troubles multiplied. Once Rebbi died, troubles increased twofold. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, there is no trouble that befalls the community as to which the Beit Din does not abolish a joyous occasion in response thereto.
Once the Sanhedrin ceased [to have jurisdiction to enforce criminal matters], song ceased from houses of feasting. But what good did the Sanhedrin perform on behalf of Israel (i.e., to merit the cessation of song)? Rather, as to this matter, as it is said (Lev. 20:4), "And if the people of the land should hide [their eyes from that man], etc." At first, when a man sinned, the Sanhedrin would fulfill its [function] and exact retribution upon him. Now [that the Sanhedrin no longer functions], [retribution is exacted both] upon him and his relatives, as it is said (Lev. 20:5), "And I will set my face against that man and his family, etc." They gave a parable: To what is this matter similar? To one who had committed a crime in the city. They handed him over to the strap-bearer, and he attempted to lash him. But he was too strong for the strap-bearer. So they handed him over to the rod-bearer, and he attempted to beat him. But he was too strong for the rod-bearer. So they handed him over to a centurion (<i>katrin</i>) who attempted to imprison him. But he was too strong for the centurion. So they handed him over to the ruler, who threw him into the furnace. So too with Israel. The later troubles cause the earlier ones to be forgotten.
During the war with Vespasian, they decreed regarding the bridegrooms' crowns (Sot. 9:14). And these are the "bridegrooms' crowns": Those of salt and of pitch<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">per Minchat Yitzchak, such "crowns" were dyed bright colors, and designed with pictures embedded</i>, but those of roses and of myrtle, they permitted. During the war of Titus, they decreed regarding the brides' crowns. These are golden crimson [crowns], but she may go out with a cap of fine wool<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מֵילָת</b> not <b>מלח</b> ("salt") (see Minchat Yitzchak here; accord Sot. 49b:6)</i>. And [they decreed] that one may not teach his children Greek. [However,] they permitted those of the house of Rabban Gamaliel to teach their children Greek because they were close to the ruling powers. And [they decreed] not to plaster one's house with lime: With blocks of lime. [But] if one mixed in straw or sand, it is permitted. Rabbi Yehuda says, [as to] one who mixed in sand with it, behold, that is cement and it is [therefore] forbidden, but if one mixed in straw with it, it is permitted. [During the] final war, they decreed regarding the bridegrooms' canopies. These are the "bridegrooms' canopies": Those of gold. But he may make one of papyrus, and hang on it everything he desires. And [they decreed] that a bride may not go out with a palanquin inside the city, but our rabbis permitted her to go out with a palanquin inside the city. Even up to the palace, decreed Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava, but the Sages did not agree with him.
Rabbi Ishmael said: From the day that the Temple was destroyed, it would be appropriate that we not eat meat or drink wine (since these were used in the Temple service).  But a court does not decree (restrictions) on the community which they cannot uphold.  He would say that since they (the Romans) decree upon us that we not learn Torah, we should decree upon the community that they not marry women (since they do not know marriage and family laws), and not have children - and as a consequence, the seed of Abraham will cease.  Rather, leave Israel alone (to continue to do as they now do, marrying and having families); it is better that (if they transgress), they do so inadvertently and not intentionally. § From the time that the last Temple was destroyed, the number of ascetics (<i>perushin</i>) proliferated in Israel, who would not eat meat or drink wine. Rabbi Yehoshua joined them. He said to them, "For what reason are you not eating meat?" They said to him, "Shall meat be eaten, when every day the daily offering was offered up on top of the Altar, and now it has ceased?"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">cf. Chag. 7a:9 ("Your table should not be full [of meat] while your Master's table (i.e., the Altar) is empty.")</i> He said to them, "Let it not be eaten. And for what reason are you not drinking wine?" They said to him, "Shall wine be drunk, when every day they would pour the libation offering on top of the Altar, and now it has ceased?" He said to them, "Let it not be drunk." He said to them, "And if so, neither should bread be eaten, for from that they would bring the two loaves and the showbread. Nor should water be drunk, for from that they would perform the water libation on Sukkot. Nor should figs and grapes be eaten, for from them they would bring the First Fruits on Shavuot." They were silent. He said to them, "My children, it is impossible to mourn excessively, and it is impossible not to mourn at all. Rather, thus said the Sages: A man may plaster his house with lime, but leave over a small amount as a remembrance of Jerusalem. A man may make all the preparations for a feast, and leave over a small amount as a remembrance of Jerusalem. A woman may fashion any kind of jewelry, and leave over a small amount as a remembrance of Jerusalem. As it is said (Ps. 137:5-6), 'If I shall forget thee, Jerusalem, let me forget my right hand, and let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if I cease to remember you.' And all those who mourn her in this world [even in moderation] will celebrate with her in the world to come, as it is said (Is. 66:10), 'Rejoice with Jerusalem and exult in her, all those who love her. [Be joyous in her jubilation, all those who mourn her.].'"
