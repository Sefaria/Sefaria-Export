Tosefta Sheviit



Chapter 1

Three [fruit] trees within a Beit Seah (a field of 2500 cubits) -- behold, they combine with one another, and one may plow the entire Beit Seah for their sake<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., one may plow up until Shavuot of the sixth year, rather than only until Pesach (see Sheviit 1:1-1:2 and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Bartenura_on_Mishnah_Sheviit.1.1.4?lang=bi&amp;with=all&amp;lang2=en" href="Bartenura_on_Mishnah_Sheviit.1.1.4?lang=bi&amp;with=all&amp;lang2=en">Bartenura)</a></i>, as long as they are planted with a density of ten [trees] per Beit Seah<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the distance between them is the distance that would occur if there had been ten trees planted over the same area (see Minchat Yitzchak here)</i>, the words of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi  Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say, one may not plow for them except for their need. How much space should be between them? Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, enough for the cattle-driver to pass [between them] with his implements. Rabban Gamaliel and his Court decreed that one who works the land be permitted [to continue working] until Rosh Hashanah (see Sheviit 1:6).
A tree that stands [by itself] on a field of two kavs (one-eighth of a Beit Seah), or two [trees] that stand on a field of four kavs (one quarter of a Beit Seah) -- they (i.e., the landowners) may only plow for their need. Three trees belonging to three people [planted on] a field belonging to one<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>אחד</b> not <b>אחר</b> ("another") (see MSS Vienna and Erfurt)</i> -- even though the owner of the field plows for the sake of his own field, behold, it is permitted [to plow the entire field, as it benefits all three trees (see Sheviit 1:5)]. [Apropos of Sheviit 1:6, which states that ten saplings scattered over a Beit Seah permit plowing the entire field for their sake], an older tree that looks like a sapling, behold, it is treated as a sapling, and a sapling that looks like an older tree, behold, it is treated like an old tree (following Lieberman). What is the difference between an older tree and a sapling? [As to] an older tree, [the field may be plowed] until Shavuot, [but as to] a sapling, [it may be plowed] until Rosh Hashanah. An older tree is in the category of "three"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the whole Beit Seah may be plowed if there are three older trees</i>, and a sapling is in the category of "ten." And reeds are subject [to the laws of Shevi'it] like saplings.
Three cucumbers, three gourds, and four saplings -- behold, they combine, and one may plow the entire Beit Seah for their sake as long as they are [all] planted [in the manner in which one would typically plant] ten in a Beit Seah. How much space should there be between them? Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, [between] each one must be [sufficient space] underneath and behind [for a gatherer] together with his equipment [to pass through] (see Sheviit 1:2).   
What is a "sapling"? Rabbi Yehoshua says, "a five year-old, a six year-old, a seven year-old." Said Rebbi, for what reason did they say, "a five year-old, a six year-old, a seven year-old"? Rather, I say<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>אומר אני</b> not <b>מדיני</b> ("countries"), see Lieberman</i>, grapevines, five years old; figs trees, six years old; and olive trees, seven years old.
They may sell and remove manure before Shevi'it from [the field of] a Jew suspected [of not observing the laws] of Shevi'it, and from a Gentile or from a Samaritan it is even permitted on Shevi'it [itself]. Until when is it permitted to fertilize [a field]? As long as it is permitted to plow, it is permitted to fertilize.
They may irrigate saplings until Rosh Hashanah. Rabbi Yosei ben Kiper says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, Beit Shammai say, one may irrigate the foliage and let [the water] drip down to the roots, [and] Beit Hillel say, [one may irrigate] both the foliage and the roots. Said Beit Hillel to Beit Shammai, if you permit part of it (i.e., irrigating part of the tree), would you not permit the whole thing, and if you do not permit the whole of it, you should not permit even a part of it.
And they may train saplings to grow straight (e.g., using an espalier), until Rosh Hashanah. Rabbi Yehuda says, if they were "blessed"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מבורכות</b>; alternatively, <b>מכורכות</b> ("tied up") (MS Erfurt)</i>, they may be removed even on Shevi'it itself. What are <i>ugiyot</i> (cf. Moed Katan 1:1)? They are [circular ditches] around the base of the trees. They may string vines and spread them out on a beam<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מַתְנִיתָא מְװַתְּרִין בִּגְפָנִים וּמְשַׁמְּטִין בְּקָנִים</b> (see  <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit_2.2.4" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.2.2.4">Y. Shev. II.2.4</a>, Guggenheimer tr.)</i>. In a place where they were accustomed to "string and spread out" before the Festival (i.e., Sukkot), they may string and spread out before Sukkot. [Where they were accustomed to "string and spread out"] after the Festival, they may string and spread out after the Festival.
Unripe figs of the sixth year that continued ripening into Shevi'it (Sheviit 2:5): Rabbi Yehuda says, in a place where they were accustomed to applying oil [to the unripe figs on the tree to hasten their ripening], they may not apply oil to them because that is "labor," [but] in a place where they were not accustomed to applying oil, they may apply oil. And [unripe figs] of the seventh year that continued ripening into the eighth year, everyone is equal (i.e., the same rules apply regardless of custom), and they may not apply oil to [the figs], nor may they smear them (מקנחין). And so too would Rabbi Yehuda say, one who purchases unripe figs from his fellow in the other years of the sabbatical cycle, even in a place where they were accustomed to apply oil, they may apply oil. One may not smear resin on the roots [of a bulbous plant] because it makes it softer (i.e., advances its ripening), but one may smear it on their leaves.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">tr. from "smear resin" follows Jastrow (<b>תָּרַף</b>)</i>
A fig tree that was peeled (i.e. its bark was removed) -- they may not plaster it (to protect the tree), because that is [considered] work. They [also] may not suspend a <i>techumin</i> (i.e. a meal used to extend the Shabbat boundary) on a fig tree, and they may not graft [another tree] onto a fig tree, because that is [considered] work. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, on a Festival they may wrap the tree (i.e., for protection), and on Shevi'it, they may turn the soil.
They may color a tree [whose fruits fail to mature] red with vermillion and load it with stones, and they need not be concerned, neither in regards to Shevi'it nor in regards to "the ways of the Amorites"(see Shab. 67a:11-68b:11). They may remove stones<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מְסַקְּלִין</b> not <b>מסלקין</b> ("raise up"), see Sheviit 2:3</i>, remove thorns, cut off [branches], cut stones, and add supports (e.g., a trellis), and caprify<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>ומגמזין</b> ("suspend branches of the wild fig on the cultivated") (see Jastrow (<b>גמז</b>))</i>, until Rosh Hashanah, and remove a <i>roeh</i> (a type of insect). Rabban Shimon ben Elazar says, they may not apply oil to unripe figs on Shevi'it.
They may plow an irrigated field and irrigate them [until] thirty days before Rosh Hashanah. Rebbi says, until three days before Rosh Hashanah, in order that it become seeded and take root.
They may not search for seeds inside dung or inside an earthen pot (but see Lieberman, omitting "or inside an earthen pot"), but they may search for them in the ground or inside an earthen pot. And one may keep them from Shevi'it until after Shevi'it (i.e., they are not subject to the laws of removal). And they may let the aloes that are on the roof to remain, but they may not irrigate them.

Chapter 2

They may irrigate a field before Shevi'it so that vegetables will grow during Shevi'it, and not only that, but even on Shevi'it [itself] they may irrigate it so that vegetables will grow after Shevi'it.
Onions that grew from before Shevi'it until Shevi'it -- they may irrigate their leaves with water in order for it to be ease to press them. The luf that brings up <i>tamarat</i> (a fruit-like excrescence on leaves and berries) on Shevi'it -- one need not remove it from them on Shevi'it for the sake of appearances (i.e., it will look like one is working the field). Onions that grew from before Shevi'it to Shevi'it or that grew from Shevi'it until after Shevi'it -- one may water their leaves with water so that they will be easy to pull out of the ground.
One who plants [vegetables] or sinks [vine-shoots] or grafts up until thirty days before Rosh Hashanah<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see Sheviit 2:6 (Kulp tr.)</i>, it is allowed to survive the year, and is permitted to remain [in the ground] during Shevi'it. Less then that (i.e., if one performs these less than thirty days), it is not allowed to survive the year, and it is forbidden to let it remain [in the ground] on Shevi'it. Newly planted fruit trees -- they are forbidden until Tu B'Shevat (the fifteenth of Shevat), and if they are <i>orlah</i>, they are considered <i>orlah</i>, and they are  fourth-year trees (whose fruits are permitted), they are considered to be fourth-year trees [as of Tu B'Shevat].
Egyptian beans from which one withheld water thirty days before Rosh Hashanah, one tithes them for the prior year, and they are permitted to remain [in the ground] during Shevi'it, and if not, they are forbidden to remain in the ground for Shevi'it and they are tithed for the coming year. <i>In what case does this apply?</i> In an irrigated field, but in the field of one who withheld water from them, [it applies if water was withheld] for two cycles, the words of Rabbi Meir (Shev. 2:9). And the Sages say, three [cycles]. Rabbi Yosei ben Kiper said in the name of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri, in what case does this apply? When he planted vegetables and [subsequently] intended it for its seed, but if he planted it for its seed from the beginning, and only some of them took root before Rosh Hashanah, and some of them took root after Rosh Hashanah, one may not take tithes from them on behalf of [produce in] another location, nor in another location on behalf of them. Rather, he enters the threshing floor and tithes from it on their behalf, and it comes out that he has tithed from the new on behalf of the new, and from the old on behalf of the old. [And he conducts] poor tithe or second tithe according to the proportion (i.e., of old versus new produce), [and] he takes a tenth  and designates it as poor tithe or second tithe. If he planted it from the beginning for the sake of both its seed and its vegetable, or if he planted it for its seed and changed his mind to the vegetable, its seed is tithed for the prior year, and its vegetable according to the time of harvest.
Said Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree about [produce that] completed its growth, that [belongs to] the prior year [for purposes of tithes], nor about the fact that the blossoms are [tithed] in the coming year. About what did they disagree? About their pods, for Beit Shammai say that they belong to the prior year, and Beit Hillel say they belong to the coming year. And [thus] it turns out that it is said that there are three measurements in vegetables: Egyptian beans that are planted for the sake of their seeds -- even though they take root before Rosh Hashanah, and are harvested after Rosh Hashanah, they are one tithes it and the time of gathering is when it is subject to tithe, and one may tithe its seed on behalf of its vegetable, and its vegetable on behalf of its seed. If its pods had finished forming before Rosh Hashanah, its seed is tithed for the prior year, and its vegetable at the time of harvest.  Anethum and coriander that one planted for the sake of their vegetable, even though they took root before Rosh Hashanah and they were harvested after Rosh Hashanah, one takes tithes from them and the time of their harvest is their time for tithes, and one may tithe their seed on behalf of their vegetable, and their vegetable on behalf of [other parts of] their vegetable. If it grew to a third [of its expected size] before Rosh Hashanah, their seed is tithed for the prior year, and their vegetable for the time of their harvest. 
Anethum that one planted for the sake of its seed, he tithes the seed and is exempt as to its seed-pods and its greens. [If] he planted the seed pods, he tithes the seeds and the seed-pods and its greens are exempt. [If] he planted the greens [and they grew], he tithes the seed pods and the greens.
Any vegetable that one planted for the sake of its seed, and he nullified it in his mind, its vegetables are liable and its seeds are exempt. Grains<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>התבואה</b> not <b>התאנה</b> ("figs") (see Lieberman)</i> and legumes that he planted for the sake of their seed, and he nullified it in his mind, their seeds are liable [for tithes] and their produce is exempt. Beans and barley and fenugreek that were planted for the sake of their produce, and he nullified in his mind, their seeds are liable and their produce is exempt. Cress and arugula that one planted for the sake of its seed, both their seeds and their produce are tithed. (See Eruvin 28a:13.)
Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, summer onions that ripened<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>שרכנן</b> not <b>שרבצן</b> ("that were irrigated") (see Lieberman)</i> before Rosh Hashanah, they are tithed for the previous year and permitted [for consumption] on Shevi'it, and if not, they are forbidden on Shevi'it and are tithed in the next year. [If they were irrigated] in the second year and came in on the third year, one may not crush them nor may one withhold [water] from them, in order that they be [fit for] the poor tithe. [If they were irrigated] in the third year and came in on the fourth year, one may crush them and withhold [water] from them because they are of second tithe, and it is permitted to crush them for the pilgrimage, and this is the custom of every person.
Every vegetable that was watered before Rosh Hashanah is permitted to remain [in the field] during Shevi'it. [But] if they were very small<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>דקין</b> not <b>רכין</b> ("soft") (see Lieberman)</i>, it is forbidden for them to remain during Shevi'it, for the sake of appearances (as others may think that they were planted during Shevi'it). They do not require him to uproot the luf; rather, he may leave them as they are. If it sprouts after Shevi'it, it is permitted. They do not require him to uproot an artichoke, but he may cut off the leaves. If it sprouts after Shevi'it, it is permitted.
The grains and the beans that grew a third [of their expected size] before Rosh Hashanah -- they are tithed for the previous year and they are permitted on Shevi'it, and if not, they are forbidden on Shevi'it and they are tithed for the next year (i.e., the eighth year). Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says, Egyptian beans that one planted for the sake of their spikes<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., to use as fodder (see Jastrow, "עָמִיר")</i>, and so too "camel" beans (i.e., large beans) and everything similar to them -- they are tithed for the previous year and permitted on Shevi'it, and if not, they are forbidden on Shevi'it and they are tithed for the next year. Said Ben Azzai before Rabbi Akiva in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua, even that which has taken root [by Rosh Hashanah is tithed for the previous year], and Rabbi Akiva retracted and started teaching according to the words of Ben Azzai.
They may not gather grasses [growing] on top of manure , but they may gather straw from it. They may place straw or stubble on it so that it will increase in size, [and] they may pour water on it so that it will flower, and one may hoe it so that it will swell up (alt., "become moist").
They may not add to the [number of] wicker baskets [placed on dunghills<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., which contain foliage that the dung will cause to sprout (see Jastrow "מִשְׁפֶּלֶת")</i>] nor to the dunghills themselves, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says, they may add to to the wicker baskets but they may not add to the dunghills. Rabbi Shimon says, [they may] even [add] to the dunghills as long as there are not fewer than three dunghills per Beit Seah (see Sheviit 3:2).
One who uses his field to pen cattle, he [first] makes an enclosure for [every] two Beit Seahs (see Sheviit 3:4). When it is filled [with manure], he may remove it from inside the enclosure and make dunghills inside his field in the manner of the fertilizers, and then he goes back and makes another enclosure. Said Rabbi Yehuda, in what case does this apply? At a time when he had only a few small livestock (i.e., sheep and goats). But if he had a lot of small livestock, even a Beit Kor (1/16 of a Beit Seah), even a field the size of two kors, it is permitted [to perform this procedure]. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says,  he thrusts in the center stake, and he surrounds it with four enclosures, [one in each of] the four directions.
[If] his whole field was two seahs, he should not cover the whole thing with enclosures; rather, he should leave some of it [as is] for the sake of appearances, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei permits it. One may remove [manure] from this enclosure and places it inside another enclosure, as long he does not return it to the first one, the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages permit it. One may remove [manure] from this field and places it inside another field, as long as he does not return it to the first one, the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages permit it. One may remove [manure] from this enclosure and place it inside a different enclosure, as long as there is not [a distance equivalent to] eight seahs between him and his neighbor, the words for Rabbi Dostai bar Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei ben Kiper says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, a two-seah field, and [in this] two-seah field, this one may milk [the livestock] and that one may shear within it, and he brings in and takes out [his flock] through it.
They may make their enclosures with anything -- with stones, with reed mats, with straw, with reeds, or with stalks. Even three ropes, this one on top of that one and that one on top of the other one, [it is permitted] as long as there are at least three handbreadths between one rope and the next so that a young goat can enter [between them].
One may not pen animals [in a field in order for them to fertilize it] either on Sabbaths or on Festivals, nor on the intermediate days of Festivals, even as a favor. If [the animals] came of their own accord, they may not remove them. And it is not permitted to appoint a guard to "evacuate" the flock (i.e., to ensure that the animals relieve themselves). [But] if they were penned [in a field] for weeks, months, or years (alt., "for Sabbaths, for New Moons, or for Festivals"), it is permitted to appoint a [Gentile] guard and [for the Gentile] to "evacuate" the flock. Rebbi says, one may pen [another's animals in his own field] on Shabbat as a favor, on a Festival in exchange for a meal, and on the intermediate days of a festival one may even receive wages for it. 

Chapter 3

A person may not open a new quarry inside his field [during Shevi'it] unless there are [enough stones for] three layers of three by three, and three [stones] high (Sheviit 3:5). Said Rabbi Yehuda, in what case does this apply? When one intends to make a field, but when one does not intend to make a field, even a larger amount is permitted. Said Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel, in what case does this apply? When one does not intend to make a field, but when one does intend to make a field, even the smallest amount is forbidden.
A large boulder that emerges from the ground, and the top of it rises up from [the earth] -- if it has a measurement of [less than ten handbreadths, see Sheviit 3:6], he iFs permitted to quarry it, and if not, he is forbidden. Stones that are sitting [on the ground which are small enough] that the the plow can move them -- if there are enough of them for two loads for two men each [to carry], behold, they may be removed. Rabbi Nehemiah says, they may build steps leading to ravines before Shevi'it and on Shevi'it one may support them with dirt, and place it on top of the ravines.
One may clear stones away from a public thoroughfare, the words of Rabbi Yehoshua (see Sheviit 2:3). Rabbi Akiva says, just as one does not have the right to cause ruin, so too one does not have the right to remove stones (which is an improvement), and if he did remove them, he should take them out to the sea or to a river or to a stony place. They may clear stones from the face of a private walkway and from the face of a public thoroughfare, and from [the route of] a funeral procession<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"> <b>הספד</b> not <b>הספק</b> (see Lieberman)</i> and one may make aftergrowths on top of one's roof, and let them remain [during the seventh year], and he need not be concerned about violating the laws of Shevi'it or of working the land.    
Olives from before Shevi'it that grew into Shevi'it -- one may remove stones from their place, one may fill in a depression [in the earth] that is under them with dirt, and one may dig ruts for grapevines<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Note: Per Lieberman, לגפנים, "for grapevines," should be stricken.</i> from one [tree] to another, and not only that, but even as to olives of Shevi'it that finish ripening after Shevi'it, one is permitted to do this.
Originally they would say that a person may gather olives from inside his own [field during Shevi'it] in the same way that one would gather from [the field] of his fellow (i.e., for the purpose of the produce, not to improve the field, see Sheviit 4:1), the larger the better. As time went on, they began doing favors for one another (i.e., improving one another's fields), so [the Sages] decreed that they may only collect what is nearby and what is in ample supply (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit_4.1.2" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.4.1.2">Y. Shev. IV.1.2</a>, Guggenheimer tr.). The heart knows if one is acting in a crooked manner and if for purpose of deceit (see Sanhedrin 26a:10). Originally they would say that a person may gather pebbles and earthenware shards inside his own [field] in the same way that one would father them from [the field] of his fellow, the larger the better. When the violators of transgressions increased, they retracted [the leniency] and forbade it.
A field that has been improved upon [during Shevi'it] may not be sown after Shevi'it (Sheviit 4:2). What is a "field that has been improved upon"? Whenever people [typically] plow five [times] but he plows six [times], [or they plow] six times and he plows seven [times]. Shammai the Elder says, If the time was suitable (i.e., if the Jews were not being oppressed by the government), I would decree upon it that it not be sown.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., that a field that had been improved upon in the seventh year not be permitted to be sown in the eighth year</i> [And indeed,] the Beit Din that succeeded him decreed upon it that it not be sown.
They may not lease newly broken land from a Jew suspected about [not observing] Shevi'it, but they may buy from him a sown field, for they only decreed about a place that they could sow [in the future]. One who receives a field from a Gentile may distribute it with him on the condition that the Gentile plant it. A Gentile or a Samaritan that plowed [a field] -- they may not convert it into a burial place for a corpse; [however,] the Sages did not issue decrees except in places that they were able to create a fence<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., they lacked the power to enforce such a decree against Gentiles or Samaritans</i>. One may not raise small livestock (i.e., sheep and goats), but one may raise large livestock (i.e., cattle), [but the Sages did not issue a decree] for they did not create a fence except for one that could stand.
One who cuts down the branches of a sycamore tree [during Shevi'it], behold, this one may not cut one portion evenly and one like a step [to avoid the appearance that he intends to sell them]; rather, he cuts them so that they are all equal [in height]. Rabbi Yehuda says, in a place where they were accustomed to cut logs into steps, he cuts it evenly, and [where they were accustomed to cut them] evenly, he cuts them as steps. Behold, he raises it up a handbreadth and cuts it<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">not "cuts it a handbreadth," see GR"A</i>. And so too would Rabbi Yehuda say, one who purchases a virgin sycamore (i.e., one whose branches have never been cut) from his fellow in the other years of the agricultural cycle, behold this one may raise it up ten handbreadths and cut it (contra Sheviit 4:5). § It turns out that one can say that there are three "virgins": A human virgin, virgin soil, and a virgin tree. A human virgin is anyone who has never had intercourse<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">lit., "has not had intercourse in all her days"</i>. Virgin soil is any that has never been worked, and Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, any that has never been plowed. A virgin tree, one that has never been cut.
One may not pull out a fence that is between two fields [during Shevi'it], and [the rule is] the same as to a wooden fence and a stone fence. <i>In what case does this apply?</i> When one intends to create a field [by removing the fences], but [if one intends to use] the wood (e.g., as firewood), it is permitted.  One who pulls out the roots of a carob tree or the trunk of a sycamore, it is permitted, but [if one does so] for the sake of [creating] a field, it is forbidden.
[With respect to the] hollowed-out pits from which he removed trees [during Shevi'it], behold, this one does not cover them (i.e., the pits) with dirt, but covers them with stones or with straw. One who removes thorns from reeds, behold, this one must raise it a handbreadth and cut it.  Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, in a place where they were accustomed to cut off thorns, he tears them off [during Shevi'it], [and where they were accustomed to] cut them off, he tears them off<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">"לְקוֹץ יִתּוֹק, לְתוֹק יִקּוֹץ" (see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit_4.5.2" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.4.5.2">Y. Shev. IV.5.2)</a></i>. 
They may not harvest reeds from a reed thicket [during Shevi'it], because that is their work. Rabban Shimon Ben Gamaliel permits it. And so too would Rabban Shimon Ben Gamaliel say, a person is permitted to plant a barren tree [during Shevi'it] in order to create a boundary line.
During Shevi'it, one may only train a cow [to plow] in sand. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, even inside his fellow's field it is permitted, as long as [the neighbor] does not rely on the furrow<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>יסמוך לה מענה</b>; alternatively, "does not lean on the handle of the plow," see Jastrow (<b>מענה</b>)</i>. Abba Shaul says, one may make a fence with plows [during Shevi'it], and [with respect to cutting down a tree to make logs] one should chop it down at ground-level, but he may not chop it with an axe<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>וְגוֹמֵם עִם הָאָרֶץ וּבִלְבַד שֶׁלֹּא יִקּוֹץ בְּקוֹרְדוֹם</b> (see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit_4.5.2" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.4.5.2">Y. Shev. IV.5.2</a>)</i>.
Unripe figs from before Shevi'it -- one may not distribute them on Shevi'it<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>אין חולקין</b>; alternatively, <b>אין שולקין</b> ("one may not make boiled preserves from them"), see Lieberman</i>, but with the [softer] late-ripening figs, it is permitted, because [as to the unripe figs], that is considered work. With respect to palm hearts and  date berries, they are permitted [to make boiled preserves]. From what time is a person permitted to cut down a tree on the remaining years of the agricultural cycle? When it is old enough to be subject to tithes.
They may not sell an orchard to one who is suspected about [not observing] Shevi'it. But if he [nevertheless] does so, he must stipulate with him [that the sale is being made] on the condition that [the buyer] does not have [a share in the produce] of the tree. Rabbi Shimon permits it, because he says to him, "I sold mine, go and claim yours."

Chapter 4

Rabbi Yehuda says, the Shevi'it of the Persian figs is in the second year [of the agricultural cycle], since they ripen every two years (Sheviit 5:1). They said to him, behold, they grow near you in Tiberias, and they always bear fruit once a year. One who buries luf [in the soil] during Shevi'it (Sheviit 5:2), Rebbi says, it is customary to bury it in a perforated pot so that it does not sprout. Even though there is no proof of the matter, there is a hint of the matter, as it says (Jer. 32:14), "And put them in an earthenware vessel, so that they may last a long time."
The luf<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">The identity of "luf" is a subject of debate. Per Guggenheimer (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah_6.7.1" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.6.7.1">Y. Peah VI.7.1</a>), "In classical Arabic, לוּף means serpentary, snake weed, Arum Dracunculus L., a plant with a large bulb. This is the identification given by Arukh, based on a Gaonic source. Maimonides (Commentary on the Mishnah) declares it “doubtless to be a kind of onion.” Rashi (Shabbat 126b) declares it to be a kind of legume. The determination by Arukh must be accepted."</i> as to which Shevi'it passed [while it continued to ripen], Rabbi Eliezer says, if three years have passed, one gives the poor a quarter of them. If two years have passed, one gives the poor a third of them. If one year has passed, one gives the poor half of them. From what time is a person permitted to purchase luf after Shevi'it from any location? Rabbi Yehuda says, immediately. Said Rabbi Yehuda, it so happened that we were in Ein Kushi (a Samaritan city), and we were eating luf after the Festival of Shevi'it<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>במוצאי החג של שביעית</b>; alternatively, <b>במוצאי החג של מוצאי שביעית</b>, "after the Festival (i.e., Sukkot) following Shevi'it," see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit_5.2.12" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.5.2.12">Y. Shev. V.2.12</a></i> at the direction of Rabbi Tarfon. Rabbi Yosei said to him, this is no proof -- I was with you and that happened after Passover.
They may not sell Shevi'it produce to someone suspected about [not observing] Shevi'it, whether they plant and eat [Shevi'it produce] or whether they plant and do not eat [Shevi'it produce]. Beit Shammai say, one should not sell [such a person] a field during Shevi'it, but Beit Hillel permits it.
And what is considered the "Land of Israel" (Sheviit 6:1)? From the river to the north of Achziv (now known as the Nahal Keziv), and extending until Ammon and Moab [and down to] the Land of Egypt. They are two "Lands." Either one may eat of and work the land [during Shevi'it], or one may not eat of nor work the land. Cities of the Land of Israel that are close to the border, they station a watch over them so that the Gentiles do not break through and plunder the Shevi'it [produce].
The "permitted" cities (in which one may eat of and work the land during Shevi'it) in the district of Nave (ניוי not גיתו, see Lieberman), which they [subsequently] forbade, are Saria, Teriya, Jasim (גשמיו not נשמי), and Zizun, and Yigrei Tov, and Degev, Chorvatah, and Berachah (alt., Karacha (כרכא)), and Beit Cherev. The "forbidden cities" (in which one may neither eat of nor work the land  during Shevi'it) in the district of Tyre are Shenetz, and Ketzet, and Puma Tziva, and Upper Chanita, and the Land of Chanita, Dashmiya, and Beit Mazil, the "Ruins" (כריא), and Emek Mazil. The cities that are liable for tithes are in the district of Susita, and Inishit, and Ein Tir'eh, and Romverach, Ein Yarim, and K'fra Yarim, Dacha, Chutzpiah, and K'far Tzemach. Rebbi deems K'far Tzemach as "permitted" [in tithes].
Rabbi Akiva concedes that they may not plant, and they may not plow, and they may not weed [their fields] in Syria because similar work is not permitted in the Land [of Israel], since [as long as] similar work is permitted in the Land, they may do it in Syria. [In such times,] they may not perform work on on anything connected to the ground in Syria, but they may pull them out and another bundles them on their behalf, as long as that person does not gather them up. And they may tie them on his behalf. They may harvest grapes, and one may tread on them on their behalf. They may harvest olives, and one may press them (אוטם) on their behalf. <i>In what case does this apply?</i> When one brings produce to his fellow inside his house, or when his fellow sends him produce, but one who buys it from the marketplace -- behold this one may gather it by hand and need not be concerned.
Onions that grew from before Shevi'it until Shevi'it, or that grew from Shevi'it until after Shevi'it -- if there were others like them (i.e., onions that had enough time to reach that size which grew before or after Shevi'it, respectively), they are permitted, and if not, they are forbidden. Said Rabbi Yosei, it so happened that they planted planted onions in a large vineyard in Tzippori, and after Shevi'it they planted barley in it, and there were workers coming down and weeding inside it, and they brought out vegetables inside their baskets, and the matter came before Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri, and he said, "If [other produce] similar to them grew [after Shevi'it concluded], they are permitted, and if not, they are forbidden."
One may eat leaves from late-ripening vegetables on behalf of the early-ripeners, from those [imported from] afar on behalf of those close-by, [for] once one place is permitted, every place is permitted. The luf and the garlic and the onions, [once] the dry ones are permitted, the moist ones are permitted, [but] they do not permitted the dry ones until they arrive at the threshing floor. One type [of vegetable] only permits others of its type<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>אלא מינו</b>, see Lieberman</i>, and any type of vegetable is only permitted on the authority of a scholar, and everything [permitted] after Shevi'it is liable for tithes.
A vegetable that was planted on the eve of Rosh Hashanah of Shevi'it -- behold, one may not take from it (e.g., remove its leaves) after Shevi'it<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>במוצאי שביעית</b> not <b>בשביעית</b>, see GR"A</i> until the new ones are permitted<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>שיתיר</b>; alternatively, <b>שירבה</b>, "predominate," see GRA</i>. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, one may take from it [after Shevi'it] as long as he does not bring it inside his house, even if similar produce is not yet being sold in the marketplace.
In the early days, they would say, "One may not pickle and one may not dry [produce in order to preserve it], and one may not import dried or pickled produce from outside the Land of Israel into the Land of Israel." [Thereafter,] our Masters permitted people to pickle and dry [produce], and that dried and pickled produce be imported from outside the Land of Israel into the Land of Israel. [In the early days,] vegetables could not be imported from outside the Land of Israel into the Land of Israel, [but thereafter,] our Masters permitted vegetables to be imported from outside the Land of Israel into the Land of Israel. And just as they imported vegetables from outside the Land of Israel, so too they imported grains and beans (<i>kitniyot</i>) from outside the Land of Israel into Israel. Rebbi and his Beit Din [even] permitted one to purchase vegetables immediately after the conclusion of the sabbatical year.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Note: This translation follows Lieberman, as the printed text is corrupt.</i>
Seventh-year produce that entered the Land of Israel: One may not sell them, either by measure, or by weight, or by quantity; rather, behold, they are like produce of the Land of Israel.
One may import saplings and <i>karmulin</i> (a type of gourd with edible leaves) from outside the Land of Israel into the Land of Israel, but not from outside the Land of Israel into the Land of Israel to eat from them in the Land of Israel (following Lieberman). One may not import grapes from outside the Land of Israel into the Land of Israel and tread on them in the Land of Israel, nor olives from outside the Land of Israel into the Land of Israel to pack them in a vat [in order to crush them] in the Land of Israel, nor flax-stalks from outside the Land of Israel into the Land of Israel to put them in water in the Land of Israel [in order to process them (see Sukkah 12b:5)]. But one may import dried figs and raisins and flax-stalks from outside the Land of Israel, but not from outside the Land of Israel into the Land of Israel to process them in the Land of Israel. [However,] Rebbi permits one to import them from outside the Land of Israel to process them in [areas of] the Land of Israel adjacent to [the border between Israel and] outside the Land of Israel.
Any tree on which fruits formed before the fifteenth of Shevat, behold, they belong to the prior year. After the fifteenth, behold, they belong to the coming year. Rabbi Nehemiah says, in what case does this apply? As to a tree that produces two crops per year, but as to a tree that only produces one crop per year, such as olive trees and date trees and carob trees, even though their fruits formed before the fifteenth of Shevat, [they are treated] as though they did not form until after the fifteenth of Shevat.
Rabbi Shimon says, from the time leaves start growing until unripe figs form is fifty days. From the time unripe figs form until the "waste figs"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>נובלות</b>, i.e., figs which cannot ripen and fall off the tree (see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit_5.1.6" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.5.1.6">Y. Shev. V.1.6</a>, Guggenheimer tr.)</i>, fifty days. From the time of the waste figs until the [edible] figs, fifty days. Rebbi says, forty days for each, and all of those which grow before that time (i.e., the fifteenth of Shevat), behold, they are [treated as belonging] to the previous year. After that time, behold, they [belong to] the coming year.
It so happened with Rabbi Akiva that he picked an etrog on the first of Shevat and he conducted himself like the words of Beit Shammai and like the words of Beit Hillel as to [the etrog]. Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda says, "like the words of <i>Rabban Gamaliel</i> and like the words of <i>Rabbi Eliezer</i>." Said Rabbi Yosei (cf. Sukkah 40a:2), "Rabbi Avtilas testified in the name of five Elders that the tithing of an etrog goes according to when it is picked. And our Masters voted on it, and they said in Usha that an etrog goes according to when it is picked, both as to tithes and as to removal [vis-a-vis the Sabbatical year]."
Rabbi Shimon says, an etrog that grows from the year before Shevi'it to Shevi'it, or that grows from Shevi'it to the year after Shevi'it, is exempt from tithes and exempt from removal, as the only thing that can be liable for tithes is something that both grew when it was liable [for tithes or removal], and was harvested when it was liable. Thus, the only thing that is liable for removal is something that both grew during Shevi'it and was harvested during Shevi'it.

Chapter 5

Seventh-year produce that was taken out of the Land of Israel -- it is "removed" in its place, the words of Rebbi. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, one may bring it into the Land of Israel and sell it in the Land of Israel, as it says (Lev. 25:7), "In your Land shall be all its produce to eat."
One may not bring terumah from outside the Land of Israel into the Land of Israel. Said Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel, I saw Shimon ben Kahana drinking terumah wine in Acco. And he said, "This comes from Cilicia." Whereupon they decreed that he drink it aboard a ship.
Leaves of chervil and palm-ivy, rose leaves and leaves of the gall-nut tree<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מִילַּת</b>, likely used to steep wine or oil (see Jastrow)</i> -- they are subject to Shevi'it and their money (i.e., earnings from their sale)  are subject to Shevi'it, and they are subject to removal and their money is subject to removal. The roots of melons, the roots of roses, and the roots of the gall-nut tree, they are not subject to Shevi'it and their money is not subject to Shevi'it, and they are not subject to removal and their money is not subject to removal. Rabbi Meir says, their money must be removed by Rosh Hashanah. They said to him, "Given that they are not subject to removal, by <i>a fortiori</i> reasoning their money [should not be subject either]." He said to them, "I am more stringent about money than I am about the root." Oil of Shevi'it -- they may light with it (Sheviit 8:2). [But if] he sold it and he bought with [its money] other oil, he may not light with it<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., money derived from selling Shevi'it produce cannot be used to buy lighting material under the laws of <i>meilah</i> (see Lieberman)</i>.
The <i>lashishut</i> (the juice of a plant used for drying) and the galbanun and the <i>yar'anah</i> (an alkaline plant used as soap), and they lye, and the <i>ohel</i> (an alcalic plant used as soap) -- they are subject to Shevi'it, and their money is subject to Shevi'it, and they are subject to removal, and their money is subject to removal. The root of the carob tree, and the root of the papyrus plant, and the leaves of the sumac tree and of the white blossom (a type of shrub) and of the rice plant -- they are not subject to removal and their money is not subject to removal. <i>Din</i> and <i>tzad</i> and indigo seed -- they may sow them after Shevi'it because that is their usual treatment.
The dyers and the perfumers may buy their bran from any place (i.e., in order to prepare bran water as a base for dyes and perfumes), and one should not withhold [Shevi'it bran from them]. [With respect to neveilah carcasses,] one does not sell them strung together, but one sells them limb by limb on top of biers.
One may not bring wild dogs or squirrels or cats or owls<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>קיפוד</b>, an alternate spelling of <b>קיפוף</b>, which either refers a species of owl, or to a long-tailed ape (see Jastrow)</i> to sell them to a Gentile and profit<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>ולישכר</b>, not <b>ולשכב</b> ("lie down")</i> from their sale, but [as to] fish brine, and the cheese of Beit Oniki, and bread, and oil -- they are permitted to sell to a Gentile and profit from their sale.
One may not gather [Shevi'it] vegetables of the field and sell [them] in the marketplace, but he may gather and his son sells on his behalf. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, he may even hire workers [to gather the vegetables] and he brings [the vegetables] inside his house.
[If] he bought a first-born animal for the wedding feast of his son, or for one of the pilgrimage festivals, and he no longer needs it, he may sell it. Rebbi says, I say that he may only sell it for "its money" (i.e., the amount that he bought it for, see Lieberman). Lulavs (i.e., young shoots) of the terebinth, the pistachio tree, and the boxthorn, and the garden-cress (cf. Sheviit 7:5, lacking "garden-cress"), Rabbi Meir says, lulavs with their leaves attached are not subject to removal, and the Sages say, [as to] leaves with (i.e., attached to) lulavs, they are subject to removal. Rabbi Shimon says, lulavs are not subject to removal, but leaves are subject to removal, since they fall off the stem (lit., "their fathers"). And whatever grew from before Shevi'it into Shevi'it, or that grew from Shevi'it until after Shevi'it, one is judged as though it was a tree, except for the garden-cress, as to which one is judged as though it was a vegetable. Yehuda ben Yeshayah the perfumer testified before Rabbi Akiva in the name of Rabbi Tarfon, that balsam is not subject to Shevi'it (see Sheviit 7:6). Leaves of olive trees and leaves of reeds and leaves of carob trees -- they are not subject to removal because they do not "end"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">in other words, there are always some remaining in the field, and one need not remove a species of produce from one's house as long as some of that same species remains growing in the field (see Lieberman)</i>.
A new rose (i.e., from the seventh year) that was preserved in old oil (i.e., from the sixth year) -- one may remove the rose and the oil is permitted (Sheviit 7:7). Old in new (i.e., a rose from the seventh year in oil from the eighth year), it is liable for removal [since the rose has had time to impart its taste]. New carobs that were preserved in old wine, one may remove the carobs and the wine is permitted. Old in new, they are liable for removal.
Rabbi Eliezer says, bundles of hyssop, and savory<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>סִּיאָה</b>, not <b>פיאה</b> ("the corner of the field"), see Sheviit 8:1</i>, and thyme that were brought in to use as kindling-wood, they may not (alt., "they may," see Lieberman) ignite them. For animal feed, they may (alt., "they may not," ibid.) ignite them. Rabbi Shimon says, even stalks from an irrigated field that dried out are forbidden to derive benefit from.
Green grass and vegetables of the field that one gathered to moisterize them<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>לחטן</b> not <b>להטין</b>, see Y. Shev. VII.1.7</i> for animal feed, he is permitted to moisturize them. Asphodel <sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>עִירִית</b>, a type of plant (see Lieberman)</i> that was gathered for animal feed, behold, this is must be removed. [If] it was placed under the mattress [in order to drive away snakes (see Lieberman)], it is [treated] like it had already been removed. Stubble of Shevi'it -- one may not stuff it inside a mattress, nor inside mud. [But] if others placed it [inside a mattress or in mud], behold, it is like it had already been removed.
An oven that one ignited with stubble or with straw of Shevi'it, it must be cooled down. They may sell human food or livestock feed in order to by human food with [the money obtained from] it. But they may not sell livestock feed in order to by [other] livestock feed with it, and needless to say, human food [may not be sold] in order to buy livestock feed. 
Shevi'it produce -- they may not feed them to livestock, or to undomesticated animals, or to fowl. If livestock walked of its own accord under a fig tree and ate figs, or under a carob tree and ate carobs, one is not liable to return it, pursuant to that which is said (Lev. 25:7, JPS tr.), "[and your cattle and the beasts] in your land may eat all its yield."
They may feed troops quartered [in their homes] Shevi'it produce, but they may not feed Shevi'it produce to a Gentile or to a hired worker, but if it was a worker hired for a week or for a month or for a year or for seven years, or if he stipulated [to provide the worker] with his meals, they may feed him Shevi'it produce.
A Beit Din may not apportion Shevi'it produce to a [destitute] woman, but she may be sustained with [the Shevi'it produce] of her husband. Aftergrowths of Shevi'it -- one may not detach them [from the ground] by hand, but one may plow in his usual fashion or livestock may graze on it in its usual fashion.

Chapter 6

Shevi'it [produce] may be used for eating, for drinking, and for anointing (Sheviit 8:2). For eating, something that one is accustomed to eating. For drinking, something that one is accustomed to drinking. For anointing, something that one is accustomed to anointing. <i>How does one "eat something that one is accustomed to eating"?</i> One does not require him to eat the trimmings of vegetables, nor moldy bread, nor a cooked dish that spoiled (cf. Ber. 40b:14). <i>How does one "drink something that one is accustomed to drinking"?</i> One does not require him to swallow <i>anigron</i> (water in which beets were boiled) or <i>ansigron</i> (water in which vegetables were boiled) (see Ber. 35b:23), or wine along with its dregs. [Note: The Tosefta here parallels Tos. Terumot 9:11.]
One who is concerned about a pain in his throat, we do not give him [Shevi'it] oil by itself (יערערנו), but he pours a lot of oil into <i>anigron</i> and he swallows it. One who is concerned about a pain in his teeth, he may not take a draught of vinegar and spit it out, but he takes a draught and swallows it, and he may dip [food into vinegar] in his normal fashion, and need not be concerned.
How does one "anoint with something that one is accustomed to anointing"? A person may apply oil on top of his wound as long as he does not pour it onto a sponge (מוך) and apply it on top of his wound [using the sponge]. One who is concerned about a headache, and anyone who developed a scab, may rub oil [on it], but may not rub wine or vinegar [on it], since oil is normally used for rubbing, [and] wine and vinegar are not normally used for rubbing.
Shevi'it wine that fell inside fish brine -- it is subject to the laws of removal. Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon says, behold, it is [treated] as if it had already been removed. A person may place a cake of pressed figs or dried figs inside a cooked dish in the same way that one puts in spices; however, one may not squeeze them [afterwards] to extract juice from them, but is permitted to do so with spices, because this is [considered] work. [As to] one who wrap up spices and puts them inside a cooked dish, if their taste is nullified, they are permitted, and if not, they are forbidden.
They may not make <i>aluntit</i> wine (see Tos. Terumot 9:8) or spiced oil [using seventh-year produce], and if one did make <i>aluntit</i> wine or spiced oil, one may anoint with the oil but may not anoint from wine or vinegar, for the nature of oil is to anoint, but the nature of wine and vinegar is not to anoint.
One may not apply Shevi'it oil on top of a marble slab (see Tos. Terumot 10:10) to roll around in it. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel permits it.  One may not use Shevi'it [oil] to anoint hands that are ritually impure. [But if] it fell onto his flesh [inadvertently], he may rub it [on himself], even with impure hands.
Shevi'it oil -- one may not seal an oven or a portable stove with it (i.e., in order to prepare it for use), and one may not anoint his shoe or his sandal with it. He may not anoint his foot with it while his foot is inside a sandal (i.e., so as to cause the sandal to become oiled indirectly), but he may may anoint his foot and step inside his shoe, [or] anoint his foot and step inside his sandal. A person may anoint himself with Shevi'it oil and roll around on top of a new tarpaulin (קטבליא) and need not be concerned.
One may not spice seventh-year oil, but one may purchase spiced oil in order to apply it anywhere [on one's skin]. Seventh-year oil may not be used [as a kindling agent] on firewood.
One may not sell seventh-year produce, either by measure or by quantity, or by weight, and one may not fill up a barrel [with wine] and sell it as is, [or] a basket [with produce] and sell it as is; rather, he says to him (i.e., to the buyer), "This barrel I will sell to you for a dinar," [or] "This basket I will sell to you for a tressis" (such that the buyer is ostensibly paying only for the barrel or the basket, and not for the seventh-year produce).
One may not fill up a basket and go out and sell it in the marketplace [during the sabbatical year]. Even in the other years of the cycle it is forbidden, for this is the custom of the Romans.
Beit Shammai say, one may not sell seventh-year produce for money, rather only for [other] produce, so that he will not buy a spade with [the money], but Beit Hillel permits it. One may not sell seventh-year produce to someone who is suspected of [transgressing] the sabbatical year -- [one may sell him] only enough food for three meals. <i>In what case does this apply?</i> Where [the produce] is something that will last for a long time, but [if it is] not something that will not last long, even one hundred meals is permitted.  
One may neither sell nor purchase seventh-year produce from a Samaritan or from a Gentile. Other says, one may sell to a Samaritan up to four issars [worth of seventh-year produce]. 
One who purchases a loaf of bread worth a pundion from a baker and [in order to satisfy the debt] says to him, "I will harvest [this] field of vegetables and bring [the produce] to you," it is permitted. Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Nehemiah forbid it.
Five who were harvesting vegetables -- one may not sell to everyone; rather, one of them may sell his and theirs. Five brothers that were harvesting vegetables -- one may sell on behalf of everyone as long as he does not make [the sale to] a professional baker.
A shopkeeper that was cooking vegetables of Shevi'it should not calculate his profit [based on the value] of the vegetables, but rather he should calculate [based on the value of] the wine, the oil, and any losses he incurred (e.g., his lost time, see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit_7.1.16" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Sheviit.7.1.16">Y. Shev. 7.1.16</a>).
A person should not tell his fellow, "Take these fruits up to Jerusalem in order to divide [the profits between us]"; rather, he says to him, "Take them up so that we may partake of them in Jerusalem," or "so that you and I may drink [from them]." (See Maaser Sheni 3:1.) And so too, a person should not say to a poor person, "Take this sela and bring me gleanings today," [or] "bring me forgotten sheaves today," [or] "bring me peah today"; rather, he says to him, "[This sela is] for the gleanings that you will bring today," [or] "[This sela is] for the peah that you will bring today."
And so too, someone who had a sela [earned from selling produce] of Shevi'it in his hand and seeks to buy a garment with it, he goes to a shopkeeper and says to him, "Give me fruits for this [sela]," and he gives them to him. And then he says to him, "Behold, these fruits are given to you as a present." And [then the shopkeeper] gives him the garment as a present. Fruits of Shevi'it -- one may not buy water or salt with [money earned from selling] them (cf. Maaser Sheni 1:5). Rabbi Yosei says, one may buy water or salt with them.
Produce of Shevi'it -- one may not give them [to another person] either in order to soak [flax] or to launder [with them] (see B.K. 102a:2). Rabbi Yosei says, one may give them [to another] in order to launder [with them]. Donkey-drivers and camel-drivers and sailors that were hired during Shevi'it  -- their wages are "Shevi'it" (i.e., they may be paid with Shevi'it produce).
Olives of Shevi'it -- they may not process them with a roller. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel permits it. Rabban Gamaliel and his Beit Din decreed that they may process [olives] with a roller. Rabbi Yehuda says, one may grind [grain] with a hand-mill, as one does not grind in this fashion during the other years of the agricultural cycle (and thus it is a permissible alteration). Rabbi Shimon says, one may crush a <i>mikpeh</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מקפה</b> ("a stiff mass of grist, oil and onions") (Jastrow)</i> in a kneading trough.
Grapes of Shevi'it -- they may not tread on them in a winepress, but they may tread on them in a kneading trough. Rabbi Yehuda says, one may tread on them with one's toes inside a barrel. Figs of Shevi'it -- one may not make them into  dried figs, but one may make pressed fig cake with them. Rabbi Yehuda says, one must crush [the figs] and dry them out by hand (thereby altering the usual process).
One may crumble up pomegranates to make them into dried [pomegranates], and one may anoint grapes [with oil] to make them into raisins. One may not purchase Terumah [produce] with Shevi'it money, lest they cause it to become disqualified. And Rabbi Shimon permits it.

Chapter 7

One may not exchange second-tithe [money] for Shevi'it produce, but if it was exchanged, he eats it according to the more stringent between them. Shevi'it produce and poor-tithe produce that got mixed up, he eats it according to the more stringent between them. Shevi'it produce with which he bought other things, he eats them according to the more stringent between them. Second-tithe produce with which he bought other things, he eats them according to the more stringent between them.
There is a stringency with Shevi'it that there is not with second tithe, and with second tithe that there is not with Shevi'it: That with Shevi'it, it applies to ownerless [produce] just as it does guarded [produce], and [disqualified] food just as it does food [that is not disqualified for consumption], and food for human consumption just as it does food for animal consumption, and the shells of nuts just as it does the peels of pomegranates, and everything similar, none of which applies to second-tithe [produce].
Seventh-year [produce] may all be exchanged for one another, but second-tithe [produce] may only be exchanged for that of the same type. [One type of] seventh-year [produce] may nullify produce of any other type, but second-tithe [produce] may only nullify produce of its own type. Seventh-year [produce] -- both it and its money (i.e., the money obtained through its sale) are forbidden, but second-tithe produce -- either [the produce] itself or its money are forbidden (but not both). Seventh-year [produce] may not be used to purchase a peace offering, which is not the case with second-tithe [produce].
The stringency with second tithe -- that second-tithe may acquire jars of wine (Maaser Sheni 1:3), but its money is forbidden, [and in the case of] a doubtful admixture of any quantity, one is required to add a fifth (see Maaser Sheni 4:3), and is required to make a confession (Maaser Sheni 5:10), and it is forbidden to mourners (Maaser Sheni 5:12), and one is only permitted to eat it if it has been redeemed (Maaser Sheni 3:6), and one may not use it to kindle a candle, which is not the case with Shevi'it [produce].
Shevi'it and second-tithe [produce] are the same in that they may be exchanged for a wild animal or a fowl, or for an animal with a defect [that disqualifies it as an offering], whether alive or slaughtered, the words of Rebbi. And the Sages say, this was only said in regards to [a bird or an animal] that had been slaughtered.
Shevi'it and second-tithe [produce] are [also] the same in that one may not use them as repayment on a loan or a debt, nor may one pay back a favor with them, nor may one redeem captives with them, nor may one use them for wedding gifts, nor may one use them toward charity levied [by the synagogue], but one may use them to send something . One does not use them for best men’s meals. One does not pay with them obligatory payments. One does not use them to pledge for charity in the synagogue. But one may use them for [voluntary] goodwill donations, and one may give them to a town scholar as a favor.
There are three "lands" for purposes of removal: Judea, and trans-Jordan, and the Galilee, and each of those three has three regions (see Sheviit 9:2). For what reason are the mountains region and the valley region and the plains region [of Judea] mentioned? In order that one not eat [produce] from the mountain region on account of what is the valley region, nor from the valley region on account of what is in the mountain region. Rather, the mountain region and <i>its</i> mountain; the valley region and <i>its</i> valley; the plains region and <i>its</i> plains (i.e., residents of the mountain region may not rely on produce that may be growing in a mountainous area of another region, etc.).    
And in Syria they (the Sages) did not speak of "three lands"; rather, they (the residents of Syria) may eat from the first[-ripened produce] until the last [produce] to come in is finished (i.e., it can no longer be found in the field, see Sheviit 9:5). Rabbi Shimon says, they did not speak of "three lands"; rather, in Judea and in all the other lands, they may continue to eat until [the produce of that species] can no longer be found in Beth El or within the walls of Caesarea (גדרה של קסרין). What is "its mountain" (Sheviit 9:2)? That is the Kings Mountain. [What is] "its plains"? Those are the Plains of Lod. [What is] "its valley"? From Ein Gedi until Jericho. 
What is the "valley" that is in the Galilee? That such as Ginosar and that which is adjacent to it. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, what is the mountain that is on the "other side of the Jordan" (Sheviit 9:2)? That such as Harim and such as Gibor Gadur and that which is adjacent to it. Its "plains"? "Heshbon and all its towns in the Tableland: Dibon, Bamoth-baal, Beth-baal-meon" (Josh. 13:17, JPS tr.). Its "valleys"? That such as Beit Namra (Josh. 13:27), Ramata, and that which is adjacent to it. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel says, a sign for "mountains" is ash trees; a sign for "valleys" is date palms; a sign for "rivers" is reeds; a sign for plains is sycamores. And even though there is no proof of the matter [in Scripture], there is at least a hint of the matter (1 Kings 10:27): "[Solomon] made cedars as plentiful as sycamores in Shephlah"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., although "Shephlah" is the proper name of a location in 1 Kings 10:27, the literal meaning of that word (<b>שפלה</b>) is "plain").</i>
They may eat [Shevi'it produce] in the King's palace until [that species] can no longer be found in Beth El. Even though there is no proof of the matter, there is a hint of the matter (Gen. 49:27, JPS tr.): "Benjamin is a ravenous wolf" -- this is the land that he seized; "In the morning he consumes the foe" -- this is Jericho, which is the earliest [to no longer have produce in the field]; "And in the evening he divides the spoil" -- this is Beth El, which is the latest. ]" This is the land that he seized in the morning." One may eat purslane until the <i>agotrei</i> (vegetables used for fish sauce) are gone [from the field]. And the residents of the Upper Galilee until <i>lofsei</i> [are gone from the field]. [And the residents of] Beit Dagan and adjacent areas in the Lower Galilee until the <i>ahina</i> (=אֲהִינָא, a species of late and inferior dates, see Jastrow) [are gone from the field] of Ma'an Ana.
They may eat figs until unripe figs are no longer found in Beit Vani (פגי בית וני, see Lieberman). Said Rabbi Yehuda, they only mentioned the unripe figs of Beit Vani as to tithes. The unripe figs of Beit Vani, and the <i>ahina</i> (see previous) of Ovnia are liable in tithes, and they may not partake of the additional growths that are in Acco. Rabbi Yosei says, they may eat [figs] on account of the additional growths that are in Acco, and on account of the figs that bear twice a year, but not on account of the unfallen figs left on the edges of the trees. Rabbi Yehuda says, even on account of the unfallen figs left on the edges of the trees. Rabbi Yosei says, the twice-bearing [fig trees] that are early ripeners -- until the summer fruits are finished, they may [continue to] eat [other figs] on their account.
They may eat grapes until there are no longer grapes of the espalier that are in clusters. If there are late-ripeners among them, they may [continue to] eat [other grapes] on their account, and the remaining areas of all the lands, it is the same as to olives and dates (Sheviit 9:3). They may eat olives until the last ones are gone from Tekoa. Rabbi Eliezar ben Ya'akov says, even on account [of the olives] of Gush Chalav, in order that a poor person may go out [and gather olives] until there is no longer a quarter-<i>kav</i> left [to gather], either from above him or below him (i.e., either on the tree or on the ground). They may [continue to] eat dates until the last ones are gone from Tzoar. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, they may [continue to] eat on account of those that are [lodged] between the palm branches [after falling off the tree], but they may not eat on account of what is stuck on thorns. And the other types of fruits from the tree, such as walnuts and Crustumenian pears, and the quinces, and the crabapples -- they may eat from what is on the mountain on account of what is in the valleys, and from what is in the valleys on account of what is on the mountain. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, they are all [treated] like the carob -- they may eat on their account until the second rainy season. They may [continue to] eat [vegetables in their homes] on account of vegetables that are in irrigated fields, according to the fact that they are never gone [from the field].
Roots of cabbage-heads that dried out are forbidden to benefit from. Rabbi Shimon says [that with respect to] cabbage-heads, even though they dried out, they may [continue to] eat similar [cabbages] on their account that they have collected [and stored in their homes], and the dried ones are subject to removal.
From what time should they distance themselves from [traversing through] paths within fields<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., in order to not disturb the soil and ruin the seeds (see Minchat Yitzchak)</i>? From the time of the second rainy season. Said Rabbi Yosei, in what case does this apply? At a time that the years proceed in their proper way [vis-a-vis rainfall]. But now that the years have been "punished," there is but a single rainfall, one needs to walk [along the paths, presumably to irrigate by hand]. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, rains that fell for seven days, one after another without stopping, they have a sufficient quantity to constitute a second rainy season.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Note: Per Chisdei David, this is not a halacha specific to the Sabbatical year, but rather applies throughout the agricultural cycle. (See also Sheviit 9:7, "Until when may the poor enter the orchards?")</i>

Chapter 8

At first, the agents of the court would sit at the entrances of the towns: They would take the produce from anyone who would bring it in his hand; and they would give [back] to him, food for three meals. They would then store the remainder in the town storehouse. 
When the time of [harvesting] the figs arrived, the agents of the court would hire workers. [The workers would then pick] them, make them into dried fig cakes and store them in the town storehouse. When the time of [harvesting] the grapes arrived, the agents of the court would hire workers. [The workers would] then reap them, crush them in the vat, place them into barrels and store them in the town storehouse. When the time of [harvesting] the olives arrived, the agents of the court would hire workers. [The workers would] then harvest them, press them in the olive press, place them into barrels and store them in the town storehouse. And on the eve of Shabbat, they would distribute from them [to] each and every one according to [the size of] his household.
When the time of the elimination (<i>biur</i>) arrived, poor people are allowed to eat [seventh year produce] after the elimination, but not wealthy people. [These are] the words of Rabbi Yehudah. Rabbi Yose says, "It is is the same for poor people and the same for wealthy people - they are allowed to eat after the elimination." Rabbi Shimon says, "Wealthy people are [only] allowed to eat from the storehouse after the elimination.
[In the case of] one who has produce of the seventh year: When the time of the elimination arrives, he can distribute [as much as he can] of it to his neighbors, his relatives and his acquaintances. He then places [the remainder] at [the entrance of] his house and says, "Our brothers, House of Israel: Anyone who needs to take, let him come and take!" He then stores it [back] in his house, and may continue to eat until when it is finished.
A debt to a shop is canceled by the sabbatical year, the words of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Sages say, it is not canceled (Sheviit 10:1). Said Rebbi, the words of Rabbi Yehuda are preferable as to one with a monetary debt, and the words of the Sages as to a debt [to be repaid with] produce.
The marriage contract of a woman: [If] she compromised it (i.e., by having previously obtained partial payment) and extended credit on it, behold, it is remitted. [If] she compromised it but did not extend credit on it, [or if] she extended credit on it but did not compromise it, behold, it is not remitted.
One who lends money to another based on collateral [and Shevi'it commenced], even though the loan is worth more than the collateral, behold, Shevi'it does not remit a debt taken against collateral, or [with respect to] a written document containing a mortgage obligation, behold, Shevi'it does not remit it.
And just as Shevi'it remits the debt of a loan, so too does Shevi'it release an oath, as it is said (Deut. 15:2, Fox tr.), "This shall be the matter [of the release]" -- the "matter" that Shevi'it releases is that it releases oaths. And [as to] a matter that Shevi'it does not release, it [also] does not release an oath [concerning that matter]. Rabbi Shimon says, it does release it, and one does not inherit from that which has been released, as it is said (ibid.), "every creditor shall release the debt he claims from his fellow."
Rabbi Yehuda says, a binding <i>prozbul</i> is signed by the judges on the inside and by the witnesses on the outside. They said to him, there is no such thing as an act taken by a Beit Din requiring confirmation.
Five debtors [whose debt is recorded] on a single document (Sheviit 10:5)  -- whoever has land may write a <i>prozbul</i> on account of it, and anyone who does not have land may not write a <i>prozbul</i> on account of it. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, even if [only] one of them has land, they may [all] write a <i>prozbul</i> on account of [that person's land]. [...] A perforated pot -- they may write a <i>prozbul</i> on its account (i.e., because it is considered attached to the ground, see Dem. 5:10). Rabbi Shimon says, even if it is not perforated, they may write a <i>prozbul</i> on its account. Rabbi Chutzpit says, they may write a <i>prozbul</i> involving a woman on account of her husband's property.
When do they write a <i>prozbul</i>? On the Rosh Hashanah Eve of Shevi'it. [If] they wrote it on the Rosh Hashanah Eve in the year following Shevi'it, even if he tore it up afterwards, he may continue to collect on it, even for an extended period of time. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, every loan [between the parties] made after a <i>prozbul</i> [was signed] -- behold, it does not get remitted.
The robber and one who lends on interest -- if they repented and returned what they had robbed, they (i.e., the victims) should not accept it from them. Anyone who accepts it from them, the Sages are not pleased with him (see B.K. 94b:5-7).
