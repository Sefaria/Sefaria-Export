Tosefta Peah



Chapter 1

These are the things that have no set amount: the peah, the bikkurim, the r'iyah, charity, and learning Torah. Peah has a minimum amount but does not have a maximum amount. [If] one makes his entire field peah, it is not peah.
These are the things that are [constantly] subtracting from a person['s ultimate reward] in this world while the principal remains for him in the world to come: idolatry, sexual perversion, and murder; and slander is equal to all of them.
A good deed has immediate and future benefit, as it is stated (Isaiah 3:10), "Say ye of the righteous, that it shall be well with him, for they shall eat the fruit of their doings." A transgression has immediate damage but no future damage [for the transgressor], as it is stated (Isaiah 3:11), "Woe unto the wicked! It shall be ill with him, for the work of his hands shall be done to him." How, then, am I to understand "[The wicked] shall eat of the fruit of their own way" (Proverbs 1:31)? Rather, when a transgression damages, it has immediate damage, and when it does not damage, it has no immediate damage.
A good thought [Hashem] combines to action; a bad thought Hashem does not combine to action, as it is stated, "If I had regarded iniquity in my heart [the Lord would not hear]." How, then, am I to understand "Behold I am bringing evil, fruit of your thoughts?" Rather, a good thought that does good Hashem combines to action, and that which does not do good Hashem does not combine to action.
[The field owner] gives a person Peah from the beginning of the field, from the middle, and from the end (Peah 1:3), but if he gives Peah either from the beginning, the middle, or the end, he has complied. Rabbi Shimon says, "If he gave either from the beginning, the middle, or the end, behold, that is [sufficient to fulfill the obligation of] Peah, but he [also] needs to give from the end according to its measure. Rabbi Yehudah says, if [even] a single stalk is left, he can rely on it for purposes of Peah, and if not, then what he gives [the poor] only [has the status of] ownerless [produce]. Said Rabbi Yehudah, in what context does this apply [i.e., relying on a single stalk]? [It applies] at the time that he [already fulfilled his obligation and] gave Peah and he seeks to add to it (but see Peah 1:3).
[If] he did not give [Peah] from the standing grain, he gives from the sheaves. [If] he did not give from the sheaves, he gives from the pile of grain. [If] he did not give from the stack of grain, he gives from the heap (=כרי, see B.M. 9:5), until he [makes it into a] stack (see Peah 1:6), and if he [makes it into a] stack, he tithes it [first] and then gives it [to the poor]
Said Rabbi Shimon, because of four things the Torah said not to give a person Peah except at the end of his field: [First,] due to theft by the poor; and [second,] due to waste by the poor; and [third,] for appearance's sake; [and fourth,] due to the deceivers. Due to theft by the poor -- how so? That they will not see a time that there isn't someone there [guarding the field], and he [?] will say to the poor person, "Come and take Peah." Due to waste by the poor -- how so? That there will not be poor people and sit around and watch the whole day and say, "Now give [us] Peah!" whereas when Peah is given at the end, he goes [about his business] and does his work, [and then] he comes and takes it at the end. For appearance's sake -- how so? They will be there and pass through and say that they saw so-and-so that harvested the field, and did not give from it Peah, that behold the Torah said (Lev. 19:9), "you are not to finish [to the] edge of your field in harvesting." Due to deceivers -- how so? That they will not say, "We already gave [Peah]." Or another version, that [the homeowner] will not leave the good and give the bad.
[With respect to] vegetables, even though they are gathered as one, they are not brought in for storage [and therefore are not liable in Peah, see Peah 1:4]. [With respect to] figs, even though they are brought in for storage, they are not gathered as one [and therefore are also not liable in Peah].
Rabbi Yosei son of [Rabbi] Yehuda says, moist [i.e., fresh] dates are exempt from Peah, because the first one does not wait for the last ones (see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.3.1.10" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.3.1.10">Y. Peah III.1.10</a>). Rabbi Eliezer son of [Rabbi] Tzadok says, the jujube is liable in Peah. Others say, even white figs (<i>benot shevach</i>, see Ber. 40b:22).
The following divide a field for Peah (see Peah 2:1, following Kulp tr.): a stream, a pool, a private road, a public road, a public path, a private path in constant use in summer and the rainy season, fallow land, a plowed field, and a different seed, and the harvest [specifically done] for animal fodder, and three furrows of newly broken land (see Kilayim 2:6), and a water channel that makes harvesting on one side impossible (see Peah 2:2). Rabbi Yehudah says, if he [is able to] stand in the middle and harvest on both sides, it divides [a field for Peah], but if not, then it does not divide.  [If] it was devoured by chagav (a species of locust), devoured by govei (another species of locust), undermined by ants, or a storm or animals broke it, everyone agrees that if he plowed [the field after it was ruined, see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.2.1.10" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.2.1.10">Y. Peah II.1.10</a>, Guggenheimer tr.], it (i.e., the newly plowed field separates), and if not, it does not separate.
One who harvests half [of his field] and sells the harvest[ed portion], [or] one who harvests half and sanctifies the harvest[ed portion], gives [Peah] from the remainder [on behalf of] everything.
[With respect to] steps whose height is ten Tephachim (=handbreadths), we give Peah from each and every one [individually], but if the beginnings of the rows were intermixed with one another, we give Peah from one [step on behalf of] everything.
He who takes out the green onions for sale and leaves the others to ripen for storage (=המארג, see Jastrow) is liable at the beginning [of his harvest] and is liable at the end [of his harvest]. [If] he had four or five grapevines, and he harvests them and brings them [for storage] inside his house, he is exempt from Peret (Peah 7:3), from the forgotten sheaf, and from Peah, but he is liable in Olelet (Peah 7:4). And if [any vines] remain [to be harvested], he gives from the remainder [only] on behalf of that remainder itself [but not on what he previously brought inside his house]. One who thins out [his produce, see Peah 3:3], gives from what remains [on behalf of] that remainder itself [but not on the thinned-out portion].  Said Rabbi Yehudah, in what context does this apply? With regards to one who thins out produce in the marketplace, but one who thins out produce inside his house, he gives from the remainder on behalf of everything [including the thinned-out portion].
If he was plucking off [his produce one at a time] and bringing it inside his house, even [if he plucked] his entire field, he is exempt from gleanings, the forgotten sheaf, and Peah, but he is liable for tithes.
[With respect to] one who is about to die who assigns his property in writing to his sons, and leaves land to his wife, however small, she has lost her ketubah (see Peah 3:7, following Kulp tr.). Said Rabbi Yosei, in what context does this apply? When she accepted [this assignment of land] upon herself for the purpose of her ketubah, but if she did not accept [this assignment of land] upon herself for the purpose of her ketubah, what [her husband] gave, he gave (i.e., the gift is valid), and [after her husband's death] she may collect on her ketubah the remainder of her inheritance.
[With respect to] one who assigns in writing his possessions to his slave, [the slave] thereby goes free (Peah 3:8, following Kulp tr.). [But if] he reserved for himself any land, however small, he does not go free.  Rabbi Shimon says, one who says, "I give all of my possessions to such-and-such slave, except for one-thousandth part of them," [it is as though] he did not say anything. [But if he said, "I give all of my possessions to such-and-such slave,] except for [my possessions in] such-and-such city or such-and-such field, even though he owns nothing but that field or [possessions] in that city, the slave has acquired these as his inheritance, and has acquired himself and become a free man. And when they said these words before Rabbi Yosei, he said (Proverbs 24:26), "Giving a straightforward reply is like giving a kiss."

Chapter 2

If he took a little Peah and threw it upon the remainder, he does not get any of it. Rabbi Meir says, "they penalize him and take them from him, both this (what he threw) and that (what he threw it upon)."
A homeowner who gave Peah to the poor, and one poor person came and took [the Peah] from behind them, behold, he has acquired it. Two poor people were fighting with each other over a [single] sheaf<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>עומר</b> not <b>עמוד</b></i> and then one poor person came and took [the sheaf] from behind them, behold, he has acquired it. For a poor person does not acquire anything [when it comes to] gleanings, forgotten [sheaves], or Peah, or found coins, until it comes into his hand.
Workers that were harvesting directly into their baskets [so as to prevent gleanings from falling], behold, [as to] these [workers], we remove them.
The homeowner may not take away gleanings from the poor (to which they are entitled) in exchange [for permitting them] to glean from the sheaves (to which they are not entitled). [If he fears they will glean from the sheaves of their own accord] Rabbi Yehuda says, in the morning, the farmer has to say: "Everything the poor will gather from the sheaves, behold, it shall be [considered] ownerless." Rabbi Dosa says, [he makes the declaration] in the evening. And the Sages say, a [declaration of abandonment] under duress is not a [valid] abandonment<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>אין הפקר</b> (see GR"A)</i>, for we are not responsible for [the actions of] tricksters.
A homeowner who gave Peah to poor people, [and] they said to him, "Give us from this side," and he gave to them [from both] this [side] and that [side], behold, [all of] this is Peah.
[With respect to] workers that were harvesting in the place (i.e., the fields) of a homeowner, they do not have a right to finish [harvesting] the entire field, but [must] leave [a sufficient portion unharvested] in order to [fulfill the obligation of] peah, and there is no peah until the homeowner sets it aside [and designates it] for peah.
[With respect to] a poor person who saw [an unharvested portion of the field that the homeowner will but has not yet designated as] peah, whether it be grain or tree-produce (i.e., fruit), he does not have the right to touch it, and it is forbidden [and considered] as robbery, until [the homeowner] lets him know that it is peah.
A Gentile that sells<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>שמכר</b> not <b>שמסר</b> (MS Erfurt)</i> standing grain to a Jew to harvest, [the Jew is] liable [in the laws of] peah. A Jew that sells standing grain to a Gentile, [the Jew is] exempt from [the laws of] peah.
A Jew and a Gentile that formed a partnership in [regards to harvesting] the standing grain, the Jew's portion of is liable [in the laws of peah], and the Gentile's portion is exempt. Rabbi Yishmael<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "Rabbi Shimon" (see GR"A)</i> says, a Jew and a Gentle that formed a partnership in [regards to harvesting] the standing grain are [both] exempt from peah. When is this? At a time that the Gentile protests, but if he does not protest, [the Jew's portion remains] liable in peah.
A Gentile<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "convert" (MS Erfurt) </i> who died and the Jews plundered his property [as he left no heirs<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see Bava Batra 142a:3</i>], it is presumed [that anything still] attached to the ground is liable in everything (i.e., peah, gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and tithes), and that all that is unattached from the ground is exempt from everything. The presumption is that standing grain is exempt from the [laws of] gleanings, from forgotten sheaves, and from peah, and liable in tithes<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">but see GR"A, switching "exempt" and "liable"</i>.
The gleanings and the forgotten sheaves and the peah [taken from the field] of a Gentile are liable in tithes<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">compare Peah 4:9 ("unless he declared them ownerless")</i>. When is this? At a time that the Gentile protests<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., he protests his produce being deemed ownerless, thus rendering it liable for tithes (see Kulp at Peah 4:9)</i>, but if the Gentile does not protest [and consents to his property being deemed ownerless], the ownerless property of a Gentile is [indeed] ownerless, and exempt from tithes.
[With respect to] a homeowner that gave peah to the poor, he has no right to say to them, "Take the seeds and give me the flax-stalks," [or] "Take the dates and give me the upper palm branches"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מכבדות</b> (see Pes. 56b:3 (Steinsaltz tr.))</i>. [If] they (i.e., the produce) fell and afterwards he separated them, he is only liable [in the laws of] peah as to the seeds.
[There are] four gifts [for the poor] from the vineyards: Peret<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., grapes that fall during harvesting (see Lev. 19:10, Peah 7:3)</i>, forgotten sheaves<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see Deut. 24:19</i>, peah<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see Lev. 23:22</i>, and olelet<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., defective clusters (see Lev. 19:10, Peah 7:4)</i>. [There are] three [gifts for the poor] from field-produce: Gleanings<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see Lev. 19:9</i>, forgotten sheaves, and peah. [There are] two [gifts for the poor] from fruit trees: forgotten sheaves and peah. [And as to] all of these, they should not [be given as] a favor, and [others] can even take [gifts for the poor given as a favor] from a Jewish poor person from his hand (i.e., since it does not lawfully belong to him in the first place). And [as to] the remainder of the priestly gifts, such as the shankbone and the jawbone and the rough-stomach (see Deut. 18:3), these may be [given as] a favor. And we give [these] to every Kohen that desires [them].
They cannot take the [gifts] of a Kohen [given as a favor] from [that] Kohen, nor [the gifts] of a Levi from a Levi.
What are gleanings (<i>leket</i>)? That which falls down at the time of harvesting or of plucking (cf. Peah 4:10). Rabbi Yosei says, "There are no gleanings except for that which falls down at the time of harvesting," as it says (Lev. 19:10), "[you shall not] gather the <i>leket</i> of your harvest."
An ear of grain that is among the standing grain, behold, it belongs to the homeowner. [An ear of grain] that is among the harvested [grain], behold, it belongs to the poor. [If] half is among the standing grain, and half is among the harvested [grain], he takes it and throws it behind him, because [in a case of] doubt [as to what is considered] gleanings, [the doubt is resolved in favor of its status being] gleanings.
[With respect to grain found in] ant holes (see Peah 4:11), it is forbidden [to the poor] under [the laws of] stealing, but if the homeowner declared them ownerless, they are permitted [under the laws of] stealing [and thus, the poor may take them]. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, "If they were [intentionally] stored there, they are forbidden under [the laws of] stealing."
[With respect to] a homeowner who gave a box [of produce]<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>כליבה</b>; alt., <b>כריכא</b> ("bundle") (see GR"A)</i> to a poor person to water it, there are no gleanings, forgotten sheaves, or peah [associated] with it, [but] it is liable in tithes. 
[With respect to] poor persons who go back and forth (lit. "return") between threshing floors, we tithe [the produce in the threshing floor], and [then] we give it to them.  The decent ones [among the homeowners] put money and edible provisions in their hands, and we give them something small in order for them to eat until they reach town. And what remains of all the gifts for the poor that are in the fields that the poor do not remove, behold, those belong to the homeowner.
When do we burn [alt., "How long do we wait until we burn," see the GR"A] the dried-up residue that is in the fields? As to the fields of fruit-trees, until Shavuot. As to "white" fields (i.e., grain fields, see Sheviit 2:1), until Rosh Hashanah (alt., "Pesach," per MS Vienna). As to an irrigated field, [we burn the residue] immediately, the words of Rabbi Yehuda. But the Sages say, as to a white field, until Shavuot, as to a field of fruit-trees, until Rosh Hashanah, due to the robbery of men and [the unauthorized grazing of] livestock, and as to an irrigated field, immediately.
[With respect to] one who beats down his field until the poor people no longer come inside it, if his [potential] loss is greater than the poor's <sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.5.3.4" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.5.3.4">Y. Peah V.3.4</a> (Guggenheimer tr.)</i>, it is permitted, and if the loss of the poor is greater than his, it is forbidden. Rabbi Yehuda says, either way, he collects [the part of the poor] and deposits it on top of the [stone] fence, and the poor person comes and takes what is his.
The stalks that are [left] in the straw or in the fields<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "in the rows" (<b>ושבשורות</b>) (see Lieberman)</i>, behold, these belong to the homeowner. Said Rabbi Akiva, with respect to these, the homeowners would act generously [and nonetheless leave them for the poor].

Chapter 3

[If a poor worker] received [a one time job] to harvest a field, [then] his son cannot glean [the gifts to the poor right] after him [before other poor people will have a chance to glean that field]. Rebbi Yossi says, “His son may glean after him.” But sharecroppers, and [regular] tenants, and a person who sells his standing crops to his friend in order [that his friend should] harvest them, [in all of these cases] his (i.e. the sharecropper’s, or tenant’s, or friend’s) son can glean [the gifts to the poor right] after him [before other poor people will have a chance to glean that field]. If there were [in the field] poor people who are not fitting [to be allowed] to glean [the gifts to the poor, then] if the owner of the field can prevent them [from gleaning], he is allowed to do so, but if [he is] not [able to prevent them from gleaning, then] he should leave them alone [and let them glean anyway] because of peaceful relations [between people].
We do not hire Non-Jewish workers [to harvest the fields], because they are not well versed in [leaving] Leket (fallen stalks), [Shikcha (forgotten sheaves), and Peah (corners of the field)].
We do not give Maaser Ani (Tithe of the Poor) to Non-Jewish poor people, but we do give them Chulin (ordinary) [food], which has been tithed [instead of the Maaser Ani] as a nice gesture.
[If] the owner [of the field] was standing in the city and he said, “I know that [my] workers are forgetting a sheaf in such and such a place [in the field],” and they (i.e. workers) [really] forgot it [there, then] it is not [considered to be] Shikcha (forgotten sheaves), [because the owner still knows about it and did not forget it]. Rebbi Shimon Ben Yehuda says in the name of Rebbi Shimon, “Even if other people were passing by on the road [next to the field] and they saw the sheaf that they (i.e. workers) have forgotten, it is not [considered to be] Shikcha until it gets forgotten by all people, [including the passersby.]”
Rebbi Yehuda says, “A person who made his whole field into sheaves [in order to later] stook them [into stooks, which in turn will be taken to the final stack] is [considered to be] like someone who bundles [sheaves] in [order to put them in a] stack [of sheaves, which makes the sheaves inside the stooks eligible to become Shikcha (forgotten sheaves),] and [then] rounded it (i.e. the stack) out [as if he has completed the stack] and [then brought more sheaves and] pressed [them] into the stack [after the stack seemed to be already finished, which is still considered to be the final act of bundling, which makes these sheaves eligible to become Shikcha].” Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel agree that if [a person] proclaimed [his produce to be] ownerless [only] to people, but not to animals, [or only] to Jews, but not to Non-Jews, [it is still considered to be] ownerless [and anyone can come and take it].
Rebbi Ilai said, “I asked Rebbi Yehoshua, ‘Regarding which sheaves Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel argue [whether they are considered to be Shikcha (forgotten sheaves) or not]?’ He said to me, ‘[I swear] by this Torah [that they argue]’ regarding a sheaf [that is left in the field] next to a hedge, or [next to] a stack, [or next to] cattle [used for plowing], or [next to plowing] tools, and it was forgotten [there by the farmer].’ And when I came and asked Rebbi Eliezer, he said to me, ‘They agree by all of these [cases that Rebbi Yehoshua mentioned] that it is not [considered to be] Shikcha. [So] what [case] do they argue about? Regarding a sheaf that [the farmer] took [with him] to bring to the city and put it on the side of a stone fence or on the side of a hedge [in order to take a break], and forgot it [there], that Bet Shammai say that it is not [considered to be] Shikcha, because he [already] acquired it [for himself], and Bet Hillel say [that it is considered to be] Shikcha.’ And when I came and proclaimed [these] words [of Rebbi Eliezer] in front of Rebbi Elazar Ben Azaryah he said to me, ‘[I swear] by the Torah, these are the words that were spoken to Moshe on Sinai.’”
[If a farmer] took a sheaf in order to take it to the city, and [then] he put [this sheaf] down [on the ground] on top of his friend (i.e. another sheaf) [while still in the field] and [then] he forgot both of them [in the field where he put them down], then the bottom [sheaf] is [considered to be] Shikcha (forgotten sheaf), and the top [sheaf] is not [considered to be] Shikcha. Rebbi Shimon says, “Both of them are not [considered to be] Shikcha. The bottom [sheaf is not considered to be Shikcha], because it is covered [by the top sheaf], and the top [sheaf is not considered to be Shikcha], because [the farmer] acquired it [for himself].”
[If a farmer] stooked [some] sheaves in a field in which sheaves have been [laid out in a] mixed [fashion], and forgot one [of the sheaves, then this sheaf] is not [considered to be] Shikcha (forgotten sheaves), until he stooks all of the [other sheaves] around it.
What is [the case mentioned in the Mishna titled as] “a sheaf that is in front of it proves [that it is not considered to be Shikcha”]? Someone who had 10 rows [of sheaves with] 10 sheaves in each row, and he stooked one of [the rows in the direction] from North to South, and [then] forgot [the last sheaf in that row.] It is not [considered to be] Shikcha (forgotten sheaf), because [that sheaf] can be counted [as a part of the last row that goes] from East to West.
Two gavels separated from one another are [considered to be] Shikcha (forgotten sheaves), [but] three [gavels] are not [considered to be] Shikcha. Two sheaves separated from one another are [considered to be] Shikcha (forgotten sheaves), [but] three [sheaves] are not [considered to be] Shikcha. Two grapevines separated from one another (i.e. from separate tree trunks) are [considered to be] Shikcha (forgotten sheaves), [but] three [grapevines] are not [considered to be] Shikcha. Two [grape] berries [lying next to each other on the ground] are [considered to be] Peret (individual fallen grapes), [but] three [grape berries lying next to each other on the ground] are not [considered to be] Peret. Two stalks [of grain] separated from one another in the usual fashion are [considered to be] Leket (fallen stalks), [but] three [stalks of grain] are not [considered to be] Leket. These are the words of Bet Hillel. Rebbi Yossi says, “Chananyah, the son of the brother of Rebbi Yehoshua says, ‘Any [type of produce] where the property of the poor person (i.e. some kind of gift to the poor) can come in the middle [of two sets of produce, one standing and one detached, both of which are one Seah in volume], for example grain and vineyard, does not combine [to form two Seahs and therefore both parts are still considered to be Shikcha]. However, any [produce] where the property of the poor person (i.e. some kind of gift to the poor) cannot come in the middle [of two sets of produce, one standing and one detached, both of which are one Seah in volume], for example fruits of a tree, does combine [to form two Seahs and therefore both parts are not considered to be Shikcha].’”
When did they (i.e. the Rabbis) say [that] standing crops [that have not been forgotten] disqualify a sheaf [that was forgotten next to those standing crops from being considered Shikcha (forgotten sheaves)]? At the time when [the standing crops] were not taken in the middle (i.e. between the time when the sheaf was forgotten and remembered by the farmer), but if [the standing crops] were taken in the middle (i.e. prior to the farmer remembering that he forgot that sheaf) then it does not disqualify [that sheaf from being considered Shikcha, and the farmer cannot go back and take it for himself]. “The standing crops of his (i.e. the farmer’s) friend [that were not forgotten] disqualify his (i.e. the farmer’s) [own standing crops that were forgotten from being considered Shikcha], [the standing crops] of wheat [that were not forgotten disqualify the standing crops] of barley [that were forgotten from being considered Shikcha], [the standing crops] of a non-Jew [that were not forgotten disqualify the standing crops] of a Jew [that were forgotten from being considered Shikcha].” These are the words of Rebbi Meir. But the Chachamim (Sages) say, “[Standing crops that were not forgotten] do not disqualify [other standing crops that were forgotten], unless they were his (i.e. the farmer’s and not someone else’s) [own] and [they were] of the same kind [of crops].” Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel says, “Just like standing crops [that were not forgotten] disqualify a sheaf [that was forgotten from being considered Shikcha], so too the sheaf [that was not forgotten] disqualifies standing crops [that were forgotten from being considered Shikcha]. And [the reason for this law] is a Kal Vechomer (derivation from minor to major) [which goes as follows]. Since standing crops by which the power of the poor person is weak [have the capability to] disqualify a sheaf [from being considered Shikcha], then for sure a sheaf by which the power of the poor person is strong should [have the capability to] disqualify standing crops.” They (i.e. the Chachamim) said [back] to him (i.e. Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel), “Rebbi! [That is not correct, because the reverse argument can be made as well, as follows.] Just like standing crops can disqualify a sheaf by which the power of the poor person is strong [from being considered Shikcha], so too the sheaf should disqualify the standing crops by which the power of the poor person is [also] strong [for a different reason as explained in the next Tosefta] [from being considered Shikcha].”
The power of the poor person is stronger with regards to standing crops than with regards to a sheaf. And [yet at the same time the power of the poor person] is stronger with regards to a sheaf than with regards to standing crops. Because [all three gifts to the poor:] Leket (fallen stalks), Shikcha (forgotten sheaves) and Peah (corners of the field) apply to standing crops, but it is not so with regards to a sheaf, [to which only Shikcha and Peah apply, but Leket does not.] And [yet the opposite is true as well since] the sheaf that is two Seahs [in size by volume] and has been forgotten, is not considered to be Shikcha, unless it is smaller than two Seahs, [whereas standing crops are not considered Shikcha even if they are smaller than two Seahs in size, as long as they have the potential of being two Seahs in size in a different year due to better growth.]
[A person] who is cutting gavels [of grain, with intention] to bundle them into sheaves later [and not right away], and also [a person who is piling up] heaps of garlic [with intention to make from the heaps] bundles of garlic, or [spread out] onions, [later and not right away, if any of these gavels of grain or heaps of garlic, or spread out onions, have been forgotten in the field, the law of] Shikcha (forgotten sheaves) does not apply to them, [and therefore they still belong to the owner, who can go back and retrieve them.] [A person] who is binding sheaves, because of [an approaching] fire or because of an irrigation canal [that broke through and is about to flood the field, if any of these sheaves have been forgotten in the field the law of] Shikcha does not apply to them, [and therefore they still belong to the owner, who can go back and retrieve them,] because he (i.e. the farmer) will check [the field for any forgotten sheaves, since he is not harvesting them, but rather moving them out of the way of the fire or flooding water.] It happened with a certain pious person that he forgot a sheaf in his field [during harvest,] and he said to his son, “Go [to the Temple in Jerusalem] and sacrifice in my name a bull for Korban Olah (burnt-offering) and a bull for Korban Shlamim (peace-offering).” He (i.e. his son) said [back] to him (i.e. the father), “Father! What have you seen in this commandment [of Shikcha that caused you] to rejoice [about it] more than all [other] commandments that are mentioned in the Torah?” He (i.e. the father) said [back] to him (i.e. the son), “All [other] commandments [that are mentioned] in the Torah have been given to us by God [to be executed] consciously (i.e. on purpose with intent). [But] this [commandment of Shikcha was given to us by God to be executed] unconsciously (i.e. accidentally due to forgetfulness), because if we would have done it willingly (i.e. left the sheaf in the field on purpose for the poor to take) in front of God, this commandment would not be counted for us [as a fulfilled commandment of Shikcha, but rather as a random act of kindness.]” He (i.e. the son) said [back] to him (i.e. the father), “It says [in the Torah], ‘When you will harvest your harvest in your field and you will forget a sheaf in the field, do not go back to take it. It shall be [left there] for the Non-Jewish resident, for the orphan, and for the widow, in order that Hashem, your God, will bless you with all the deeds of your hand.’ (Devarim 24:19) The verse has granted him (i.e. the farmer who left the sheaf in the field) a blessing. [But why did the verse need to say explicitly that the farmer will get a blessing?] Is not it a Kal Vechomer (derivation from minor to major) [which can be concluded by us logically without the need of an explicit verse]? Just like someone who did not intend to do something good, but he [ended up] doing something good [anyway], the verse considers him as if he has done something good, so for sure someone who intended to do something good, and [ended up] doing something good [that he meant to do] how much more so [should get a blessing]?” Similarly, [it says in the Torah:] “If a soul from the common people sins by accident by doing one of the negative commandments of Hashem, and becomes guilty of it. When his sin which he sinned will become known to him … (the verses go on to describe the sacrifice that the sinner should bring) … and the priest will atone for him, and he will be forgiven.” (Vayikra 4:27-31) And it is a Kal Vechomer [which can be concluded by us logically]! Just like someone who did not intend to sin, but sinned [anyway], we consider him as if he sinned. So someone who intended to sin and [then] sinned, how much more so [should be considered as if he sinned. And therefore will for sure get punished.]
Every olive [tree] that has a [distinguished] name in the field, such as the Olive Tree of Netofah had in its time, and he forgot [to collect its produce from the field], it is not considered forgotten (Peah 7:1). What case are we talking about? About a situation where he had not started with it (i.e., not begun to harvest the tree), but if he had started with it and he forgot it, behold, it is [considered] forgotten, until the time that [the owner has harvested] two seahs (Peah 7:2). 
[With respect to] a cask [of oil]<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>חבית</b>; alt., "olive tree" (<b>זית</b>) (accord Peah 7:2)</i> that [is found] against three rows [of trees] of two plots [per row], and he forgot it, it is not [considered] forgotten. When do these words apply? In a situation that he does not recognize it [as distinguished], but in a situation that he does recognize it, he may run after him (i.e., the poor person) and [the poor person] must give it back to him, even [if he runs after him for] one hundred amot<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מאה אמה</b>, not <b>מאה ומאה</b> ("one hundred and one hundred") (see Lieberman)</i>.
One who declares his orchard ownerless (see Peah 4:9), the rich people [may] take away the grapefruits and the grapes, [and] the poor people [may] take away the grapefruits and the grapes with defective clusters (olelot). What are defective clusters? Any [cluster] that lacks a "shoulder" or a "pendant." If it has a shoulder but not a pendant, or has a pendant but lacks a shoulder, behold, it belongs to the property owner, and if not, behold, it belongs to the poor people. What is a "shoulder"? Growths joined to each other at the stem, each one next to the other. What is a "pendant"? Grapes joined to the stem and that drop down. 
A Gentile that sold his orchard to a Jew to harvest -- [the Jew is] liable in [the laws of] the defective cluster. A Jew that sold is orchard to a Gentile to harvest -- [the Jew] is exempt from [the laws of] the defective cluster. 
A Jew and a Gentile that were partners in an orchard, the portion belonging to the Jew is liable, and [the portion] belonging to the Gentile is exempt. Rabbi Shimon says, a Jew and a Gentile that were partners in an orchard are exempt from the defective cluster. 
One who dedicates his orchard [to the Temple] does not dedicate the defective clusters, because a person cannot dedicate something that is not his. 
[Similarly,] a Levite to whom they gave grapes [as a gift], and there were defective clusters amongst them, there is no concern that perhaps they belong to the poor. 
One who plants an orchard in order to dedicate it [to the Temple] is exempt from orlah and from the fourth-year vineyard<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"> (i.e., the laws forbidding benefiting from fruit in the first three years, or four years for a vineyard; and see Y. Peah VII.7.2, adding "and from [the laws of] defective clusters"</i>, but he is liable in shevi'it. From what time is a person permitted to harvest his vineyard<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"> per Vilna Man. delete <b>בשביעית</b> ("during shevi'it")</i>? From the time that he knows his fruit (i.e., whether each grape cluster is going to be normal or defective), because [at that point] the vineyard is already liable in (the laws of) the growth of defective clusters.
What is considered "forgotten" in the case of large espaliers (Peah 7:8)? Whatever [produce] one cannot stretch out his hand and take it. In the case of small espaliers? That which [has not been picked] from the time that [the gatherers] pass by it. In the case of hanging vines and date palms? [What remains] from the time that [the gatherers] descend from it. And [in the case of] all other trees, from the time that he turns and walks away from it. In what case does this apply? At a time that he has not started with it, but if he has started with it, and he he forgot it (i.e., the produce), the laws of "forgotten" do not apply until he has harvested all of the surrounding area.

Chapter 4

Rabbi Yehudah says, [with respect to] a place (i.e., a vineyard) that typically produces Olelet (defective clusters), a poor person [selling wine in a location near the vineyard] is believed to say, "This wine is from Olelet" and that he gathered it as part of his gathering. [If he said,] "I and my brother," or "I and my close relative [gathered these grapes]" [he is also believed], but he is not believed to say "From such-and-such Gentile I bought it," [or] "From such-and-such a Samaritan man I bought it." The poor among the Samaritans are like the poor among the Jews [in this respect], but the poor among the Gentiles are not believed in any matter.
We do not reduce [the agricultural gifts] to the poor during the years of of the poor person's tithe<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the third and sixth years of the agricultural cycle</i> to less than half a kav of wheat or a kav of barley (Peah 8:5). In what context does this apply? [For grain that has been brought in to] the threshing floor, but [for grain brought] inside his house, we give [the poor person] any amount<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>כל שהו</b> not <b>כל שדהו</b> ("any field")</i>, and we are not concerned [that it is too little]. And as to the remainder of the priestly and levitical gifts, we give any amount, and we are not concerned [that it is too little]. [If he is saving some to give to his poor relatives (Peah 8:6)], he can save half and give half. Abba Yosa ben Dostai said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, "[If he] wants, he [can] place before [the poor people] a third and retain two-thirds for his [poor] relatives."
Kohanim and Levites that were standing around by the threshing floor, and other Kohanim came and stood [with them], they (i.e., the newcomers) cannot take [the priestly gifts] from their hands. Said Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel, Kohanim used to comport themselves generously, to not send away their brothers empty-handed, but took from their [own] share and gave to them. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, if they came before the cycle [of donations] was repeated<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>תחזור חלילה</b> (see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.6.3.2" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.6.3.2">Y. Eruv. VI.3.2</a>)</i>, they stand there until the following [cycle] and they take [at that time].
Women and slaves do not have a portion for them on the threshing floor, but we give them priestly and levitical gifts as a favor.
Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says, "Just as the the presumptive status for the priesthood [is established by] the distribution of Terumah on the threshing floors, so too, is the presumptive status for the Levites [established by] the distribution of the first tithe on the threshing floors.  [However,] the distribution in the court does not [establish] for him the presumption of the priesthood (Ketubot 26a:7).
There are two presumptions [to establish a putative Kohen's status in the priesthood] in the Land of Israel: the Lifting of the Hands [for the Priestly Benediction] and the distribution [of Terumah] on the threshing floors (see Ketubot 25b:2). And in Syria, and until the places that the messengers of the new month would arrive, [a putative Kohen's status is established by] the Lifting of the Hands, but not by the distribution on the threshing floors. And Bavel is like Syria. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, "So too, in Alexandria, in earlier times when it had a [Jewish] court."
[There is] a stringency with holy things in the Temple (i.e., sacrifices offered in the Temple) that does not exist with holy things in the outlying areas<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">e.g., Terumah, the gift of the shankbone, cheek and maw, first of the fleece, redemption of the first born, etc. (see Ketubot 24b:15 and Minchat Yitzchak here)</i>, and [a stringency] with holy things in the outlying areas that does not exist with holy things in the Temple.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Note: The clause "and ... the Temple" is absent from the Erfurt manuscript.</i> [In regards to] holy things in the outlying areas, minors have a share in them, and impure persons have a share in them, and they distribute them in a state of impurity<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">contra Tos. Terumot 10:18</i>, and they weigh one against another<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., they may substitute an equivalent amount of unconsecrated produce for Terumah (see Lieberman)</i>. [In regards to holy things] in the Temple, [the Kohen himself] is responsible for them and must take care of them, and take them to the Chosen House. [In regards to] holy things in the outlying area, [Kohanim] may only give them to a <i>chaver</i>, [while in regards to] holy things in the Temple, they [may additionally] give them to priests of the guard<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>לאנשי משמר</b> (see Bikkurim 3:12); this translation follows the GR"A's emendations</i>. 
They may not give a poor person wandering from place to place less than a loaf worth a pundion at a time when four seahs [of wheat cost] one sela<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see Peah 8:7 (Kulp Tr.)</i>. If he spends the night [at a place], they must give him the cost of what he needs for the night, oil and pulse. If he stays over Shabbat they must give him enough food for three meals, oil, pulse, fish, and vegetables. In what case does this apply? [It applies] when they do not know him, but when they do know him, they even clothe him (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.8.6.8" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.8.6.8">Y. Peah VIII.6.8</a>). [But] if he [is someone who] is just going around to all the entrances [i.e., begging from door to door], they do not get involved with him<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>אין נזקקין לו</b> (see Ket. 67b:9)</i> in every thing.
[We give to the poor from] the charity dish the whole day, [and from] the communal fund from Sabbath eve to Sabbath eve.  [We give from] the charity dish to every person, [and from] the communal fund to people from the same town. If [a particular poor person] was there for thirty days, behold, he is like the people of the town [for purposes of] the communal fund, and [we provide him] clothing for six months. [However], to the poor people of the city [we provide] clothing for twelve months.
A poor person who gave a perutah (a small copper coin) to the communal fund and a piece of bread to the charity plate, we accept it from him. If he doesn't give, we don't require him to give. [If] they gave him new [clothes] and he returned to them [worn out] clothes, we accept it from him.  If he didn't give [anything], we do not require him to give.  [If] he was used to silk clothes, we give him silk clothes (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.8.7.5" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.8.7.5">Y. Peah VIII.7.5</a>). [If he was accustomed to having] a <i>ma'ah</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מָעָה</b> not <b>מטה</b> (see Ket. 5:9)</i>, we give him a <i>ma'ah</i>; [similarly, if he is accustomed to having] dough, we give him dough, bread we give him bread, to be fed inside his mouth we feed him inside his mouth, as it says (Deut. 15:8), "[pledge to him] sufficient for his lack that is lacking to him (לו)." Even a slave, even a horse. "To him (לו)" -- this [refers to] a wife, as it says (Gen. 2:18), "I will make for him (לו) a help-mate opposite him." It so happened with Hillel the Elder, he obtained for a poor person of noble descent a horse upon which to ride and a servant to run in front of him.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">(see Ket. 67b:3, Steinsaltz tr.)</i> And moreover, it so happened with the people of the Galilee that they would bring a Sepphoris pound of meat to one old man every day.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.8.7.4" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.8.7.4">Y. Peah VIII.7.4</a> (Guggenheimer tr.)</i>
[If a poor person] was accustomed to using golden vessels [and presumably still has the vessels but no money], he sells them and uses silver utensils.  [If he was accustomed to] silver vessels, he sells them and uses copper vessels. [If he was accustomed to] copper vessels, he sells them and uses glass vessels. They said, a family of Beit Nevaltah was in Jerusalem that was descended from the sons of Ornan the Jebusite (see I Chron. 21:20). The Sages brought to them (or they brought to the Sages) six hundred golden shekels<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>שש</b> not <b>שלש </b> ("three"), per Erfurt manuscript, i.e., the amount David paid Ornan for his threshing-floor, the future site of the Temple (see I Chron. 21:25)</i> but they did not want to take them outside of Jerusalem<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Presumably, the family was now impoverished, and the Sages sought to return them to the status of their ancestor Ornan the Jebusite.</i>
One who says, "I shall not be provided for by others," [we nonetheless] persevere on him and we support him and [first] we give it to him as a loan, and we return and [then] we give it to him as a gift, the words of Rabbi Meier. Rabbi Shimon says, we say to him, "bring collateral," to give him the impression [that he is not receiving charity, see Ketubot 67b:9].
If someone was saying, "I am unable to provide for myself," [we nonetheless] persevere on him, and we support him, and [first] give it to him as a present and [then] we return and collect it from him as a loan.
One who [pretends to] blind his eyes or who swells his legs or blows up his belly [feigning illness] does not leave this world until it really happens to him.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Peah 8:9, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.8.8.3" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.8.8.3">Y. Peah VIII.8.3</a>, Guggenheimer tr.)</i>
Charity collectors may not spread out from each other [each one collecting in a different place, see Bava Batra 8b:16, Steinsaltz tr.]. [Moreover,] even if his friend gave him money that he owed him, even if he found money on the road, he does not have the right to take it with him [as others may mistakenly believe that he is enriching himself with communal funds], as it is said (Num. 32:22, Fox tr.), "and you will be clear [of obligation] before YHWH and before Israel." However, [charity collectors] may spread out from each other inside a courtyard or inside a store and collect [separately].
[With respect to] the poor person's tithe [alt., "second tithe"], we do not pay back a loan or a debt from it, and we do not compensate [others for their good] deeds from it, and we do not redeem captives with it, and we do not make wedding gifts from it, and we do not give from it as an act of charity. However, we may send it as an act of lovingkindness, [as long as we] inform [the person that it is from tithes], and we may give it to a <i>chaver</i> of the town as a favor.
[If someone] said, [he would] give [charity], and he gave, we give him a reward for his word and a reward for his act. [If he] said [he would] give, and he did not have enough in his hand to give, we give him the reward of his word, as if it was the reward of his act. [If he] did not say [he would] give, but he said to others, "Give!", we give him the reward, as it is said (Deut. 15:10), "[You are to give, yes, give to him, your heart is not to be ill-disposed in your giving to him], for on account of this matter, YHWH your God will bless you [in all your doings]." [If he] did not say to others, "Give!" but he comforts him (<b>נוח לו</b> following Lieberman) with good words/deeds, we give him a reward on that, as it is said, "for on account of this matter [etc.]."
There was an incident involving King Munbaz, who went and gave away all of his treasures [to the poor] in the years of drought, and his brothers said to him, "Your ancestors stored up treasures, and added to those of their fathers, and you went and gave away all your treasures, and those of your fathers." He said to them, "My ancestors stored treasures below, but I stored treasures above, as it is written (Ps. 85:12), 'Truth will spring out of the earth [and righteousness (<i>tzedek</i>) will look down from heaven].' My ancestors stored treasures in a place that a [human] hand can reach, but I stored treasures in a place that no hand can reach, as it says (Ps. 89:15), 'Righteousness (<i>tzedek</i>) and justice are the foundation of Your throne.' My ancestors stored treasures that do not bear fruit (i.e., generate profit), but I stored treasures that do bear fruit, as it says (Is. 3:10), 'Say of the righteous (<i>tzaddik</i>), that it shall be well [with them, for they shall eat the fruit of their doings].' My ancestors stored treasures of money, whereas I am storing treasures of souls, as it says (Prov. 11:30), 'The fruit of the righteous (<i>tzaddik</i>) is a tree of life, and he that wins souls is wise.' My ancestors stored treasures for others, whereas I am storing treasures for myself, as it says (Deut. 24:13), 'And it shall be as righteousness (<i>tzedakah</i>) to you before Hashem your God.' My ancestors stored treasures for this world, whereas I am storing treasures for the world to come, as it says (Is. 58:8), 'And your righteousness (<i>tzid'kecha</i>) shall go before you, [the glory of the Lord shall be your rearguard].'" Charity (<i>tzedakah</i>) and kind deeds are as important as all commandments of the Torah.  Charity applies to the living, works of lovingkindness apply to the living and the dead. Charity applies to the poor, works of lovingkindness apply to the poor and the rich. Charity is [performed] through a person's money, works of lovingkindness through his money and his person.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.1.1.20" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.1.1.20">Y. Peah I.1.20</a> (following Guggenheimer tr.)</i>
Said Rabbi Yehoshuah ben Karha, "From where [do we learn] that everyone that turns his eyes away from [one seeking] charity is considered as if he worships idols? As it is written (Deut. 15:9), 'Beware that there be not a base (<i>bliya'al</i>) thought in your heart... [and your eye be evil against your poor brother, and you give him nothing].' And moreover it states (Deut. 13:14), 'Certain base (<i>bliya'al</i>) men have gone out […and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods].' Just as the "baseness" spoken of there is idolatry, so too the "baseness" spoken of here is [compared to] idolatry."<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see Bava Batra 10a:10</i>
Said Rabbi Elazar bar Yosei, "From where [do we learn] that charity and acts of kindness [make] a great peace and are great intercessors between the Jewish people and their Father in heaven? As it is written (Jer. 16:5), 'So said the Lord, enter not into a house of mourning[, neither go to lament nor bemoan them, for I have taken away My peace from this people, says the Lord, both kindness and mercy].' 'Kindness' -- this refers to acts of lovingkindness. And 'mercy' -- this refers to charity, in order to teach that charity and acts of lovingkindness [bring] peace and are great intercessors between Israel and their Father in heaven."
