Tosefta Peah



Chapter 1

[These are the] things that do not have a fixed measurement [by Torah law]: the Peah (corners of the field), the Bikkurim (first fruits), the sacrifices of Reiyah (showing up in the Temple on three pilgrimage holidays), deeds of loving kindness, and the study of Torah. The Peah has a minimum measurement, but does not have a maximum measurement [by Rabbinical decree]. [If a person] makes his whole field into Peah, it is not [considered to be] Peah.
For these [evil] things they collect interest from the person in this world and the principal (i.e. main punishment) remains for the World to Come: for idol worship, for illicit sexual relations, and for murder. And for gossip [the damage and punishment are] equivalent to them all.
A merit (i.e. a good deed) has principal (i.e. immediate benefit) and it has fruit (i.e. future benefit to the person who performed it), as it is said, “They say about the righteous man that it is good for him, that they will eat the fruit of their deeds.” (Isaiah 3:10) A transgression has principal (i.e. immediate damage to the person who committed it), but does not have fruit (i.e. future damage), as it is said, “Woe to the wicked man, it is bad for him. The product of his hands will be done to him.” (Isaiah 3:11) If so how is it true [when it says the following:] “And they will eat the fruit of their ways and will be full of their own schemes?” (Proverbs 1:31) [But rather,] a transgression that makes fruit (i.e. bad consequences in the future) has fruit (i.e. causes future damage to the person), [but a transgression] that does not make fruit (i.e. bad consequences in the future) does not have fruit (i.e. future damage to the person who committed it).
A good thought is smelted by God into an action (i.e. God makes sure to turn it into an action). A bad thought is not smelted by God into an action (i.e. God makes sure that it does not become an action), as it is said, “Had I considered iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.” (Psalms 66:18) If so how is it true [when it says the following:] “Hear Earth, I bring evil to this nation, the fruit of their thoughts …”? (Jeremiah 6:19) But rather, [it should be stated as follows:] a good thought is combined by God with an action (i.e. God counts it as if it was done, even though it was not) and not a good [thought] is not combined by God with an action (i.e. God does not count it as if it was done).
A person gives Peah (corners of the field) from the beginning of the field, and in the middle [of the field], and in the end [of the field]. But if he gave either [only] in the beginning [of the field], or [only] in the middle [of the field], or [only] in the end [of the field], he has fulfilled his obligation [of giving Peah to the poor]. Rebbi Shimon says, “If he gave either [only] in the beginning [of the field], or [only] in the middle [of the field], or [only] in the end [of the field] it is considered to be Peah, but he [still] needs to give the proper amount [of Peah] in the end [of the field].” Rebbi Yehuda says, “If he left [at least] one stalk [in the end of the field,] he can add to it [from other parts of the field to make up the minimum amount and] it counts for him as Peah. But if [he did] not [leave even one stalk at the end of the field] he only gives [what he left in the beginning and the middle of the field [to the poor] as ownerless [produce, but not as Peah].” Rebbi Yehuda said, “When do we say this [that he can add the produce in the end of the field to the produce left in other parts of the field and all of it counts as Peah]? At the time that he [actually] gave Peah [by leaving at least one stock in the end of the field] and then he wants to add [to it more produce from other parts of the field].”
[If a person] did not give [Peah] (corners of the field) from standing crops he can give it from the sheaves. [But even if] he did not give [Peah] from the sheaves, he can [still] give it from the heap of sheaves. [But even if] he did not give [Peah] from the heap of sheaves, he can [still] give it from the pile [of grain] as long as he did not even it out. But if he [already] evened out[the pile of grain then] he takes off the tithes and [only after that] gives [Peah].
Rebbi Shimon said, “Because of four things the Torah said [that] a person should only give Peah (corners of the field) in the end of his field [and not in the middle or in the beginning relative to where he began to harvest from]. Because of theft from the poor, and because of wasting time of the poor, and because of suspicion, and because of cheaters. How so because of theft from the poor? That [the owner] should not see a time when there are no people there and he will say to a poor person who is his relative, ‘Come and take this Peah for yourself.’ And how so because of wasting time of the poor? That the poor will not sit and watch [the field] the whole day and say, ‘Now he is giving Peah, now he is giving Peah’, but rather since [the owner] gives it in the end [of his harvest of the field, the poor person will] go and do his work, and [then] come and take [Peah] in the end [of his work day]. And how so because of suspicion? That passersby should not say, ‘Look at so and so that he harvested his field and did not leave from it Peah, because so it says in the Torah, ‘You should not harvest the corners of your field …’ (Leviticus 19:9, Leviticus 23:22)’ And how so because of cheaters? That people should not say, ‘We already gave [Peah].’ Another explanation. That he should not leave the good [portion of the crops for himself] and give [Peah] from the bad [portion of the crops].”
Even though a vegetable is gathered at one time it is not subject to storage. But figs, even though they are subject to storage, they are not gathered at one time.
Rebbi Yossi Ben Rebbi Yehuda says, “Rutab dates are exempt from Peah (corners of the field), because the first [of the fruit] does not wait for the last [of the fruit].” Rebbi Elazar Ben Rebbi Tzadok says, “Jujubes are obligated in Peah.” Others say, “Even Stone pine and blue sweet peas [are obligated in Peah as well].”
These [landmarks] interrupt [the field] regarding Peah (corners of the field) [and obligate the owner to give Peah again from the second half of the field]: a stream, a water reservoir, a private road, a public road, a private path, a permanent public path [regardless if it was established] in the summer time or in the winter time, [a section of] fallow land, [a section of] newly broken land, [a section with] a different [type of planted] seed [than the rest of the field], [a section of] harvested [land] for [the purpose of] destruction [of the produce prior to its ripening], three ridges of a furrowed field, and a ditch with water [that is wide enough that both sides of it] cannot be harvested simultaneously [by standing on one side of it and harvesting the opposite side]. Rebbi Yehuda says, “If [a person must] stand in the middle [of the ditch even if it is without water in order that] he [is able to] harvest on this [side of the ditch] and on the opposite [side of the ditch, then it] interrupts [the field with regard to Peah], but if [he does] not [need to stand in the middle of the ditch in order to harvest on both sides of it, then the ditch does] not interrupt [the field with regard to Peah].” [If a section of the field] was eaten by grasshoppers, was eaten by locusts, was plucked by ants, was broken by wind or animals, everyone agrees that [if afterwards it was] ploughed over [then] it interrupts [the field with regard to Peah], but if [afterwards] it was not [ploughed over, but rather was left as it was after the damage, then] it does not interrupt [the field with regard to Peah].
[If a person] harvested [only] half [of his field, and not the whole field] and [then he] sold what he has harvested, [or] he harvested [only] half [of his field, and not the whole field] and [then he] sanctified (i.e. donated to the Bet Hamikdash (Temple)) what he has harvested, he gives Peah (corners of the field) from what [crops] remain [in the field] for everything [including what he already sold or sanctified.]
[If there is produce planted on top of ground in the shape of] steps that are ten Tefachim (handbreadths) high, [then the farmer must] give Peah (corners of the field) from each [step separately]. But if the tops of rows [of produce] are mixed up [and are not evenly leveled one above the other then the farmer must] give Peah from one [row] for everything.
[A farmer] who selectively picks [some produce from his field early for immediate sale and leaves the remaining produce to ripen further for storage] is obligated [to leave Peah (corners of the field)] in the beginning [after he picks some of the produce for immediate sale] and [also] he is obligated [to leave Peah] in the end [after he harvests the remaining produce for storage]. [If a farmer] had [in his vineyard only] four or five grape vines, [and then] he harvested them and brought [the harvested grapes] inside his house [in order to eat them, and not inside the wine press in order to press them into wine], he is exempt from [leaving] Peret (individual fallen grapes), from [leaving] Shikcha (forgotten sheaves), from [leaving] Peah (corners of the field), but he is obligated in [leaving] Olelot (incompletely formed grape clusters). [However,] if [after the farmer brought some grapes into his house to eat, he also] left [more grapes in the vineyard in order to press them into wine] he gives [Peah] from what has remained [in the vineyard] for that which he has left [there to be pressed into wine, but not for what he already brought into his house to eat, because that part is exempt from Peah]. And [a farmer] who plucks (thins) [some grapes from the vineyard in order to give the remaining grapes more room to grow does not leave any Peah from the plucked grapes, but rather] he gives [Peah only] from what has remained [in the vineyard] for that which he has left [there to be pressed into wine]. Rebbi Yehuda said, “When do we say that [that the farmer only gives Peah from what he has left in the vineyard for only that which he has left to be pressed into wine later, and not for what he has plucked]? When [the farmer] plucked [the grapes] in [order to sell them on] the market. But [if] he plucked [them in order to eat them] inside his house [and not sell them] he has to give [Peah] from what has remained [in the vineyard] for everything, [including what he has left to be pressed into wine and what he has plucked in order to eat himself.]”
[A farmer] who plucks [the produce and does not harvest it in the normal manner or for the main purpose of harvesting that produce] and brings it inside his house [and not inside the storage silo], even [if he has done so to] his whole field, is exempt from [leaving] Leket (fallen stalks), from [leaving] Shikcha (forgotten sheaves), and from [leaving] Peah (corners of the field), but he is obligated in [taking of] Maaserot (tithes).
[A person who is either dangerously ill or healthy,] writes away [in a contract all of] his [movable and immovable] property to his sons and [also] writes away [in the same contract] to his wife land of any size – [the wife] loses [the right to claim the value of] her Ketubah (marriage contract) [upon the husband’s death or divorce]. Rebbi Yossi said, “When do we say this [that the wife loses the right to claim the value of her Ketubah upon the husband’s death or divorce]? At the time when she accepted upon herself [to receive this land] as a part of her Ketubah. But if she did not accept upon herself [to receive this land] as a part of her Ketubah, whatever [the husband] gave her [is considered to be] given [to her as a regular gift] and she [can still] claim her Ketubah [upon his death or divorce] from [his] other property [that he gave away to his sons in the above mentioned contract].”
[A person who is either dangerously ill or healthy, ] writes away [in a contract all of] his [movable and immovable] property to his [non‐ Jewish] slave, [the slave] goes out a free person. [But] if [the owner] left [for himself] land of any size, [then the slave] does not go out a free person. Rebbi Shimon says, “[A person] who says, ‘All of my [movable and immovable] property is given to so and so, my slave, except for [this] one of many thousands [of items] among them,’ [it is as if] he did not say anything [and the slave does not go out free, but rather remains his slave]. [But if a person said that he is giving all of his movable and immovable property to his slave, ‘except for a particular city, [or] except for a particular field’, even though there is no [anything else] there except for that field or that city (i.e. the owner did not have any other possessions anyway) this slave has acquired the [only other] property [of that person] (i.e. himself) and [therefore] acquired himself [to go out as a] free person.” And when [these] words [of Rebbi Shimon] were said in front of Rebbi Yossi, he said “Lips will kiss the one who replies straight things.” (Proverbs 24:26)
