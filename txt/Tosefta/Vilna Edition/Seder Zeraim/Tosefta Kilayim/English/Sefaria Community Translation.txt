Chapter 5




A horse may not be tied to a mule, or a mule to a donkey, or a donkey to a wild ass, because this one may be driven with that one. If he [nonetheless] did so, Rabbi Meir holds him liable, and the Sages exempt him. Rabbi Yehuda says, the offspring of a female horse and the offspring of a female donkey are forbidden [to be tied] together, but the sages say, all mules are a single species. Assi the Babylonian says, it is forbidden to ride on the back of a mule, from a <i>kol v'chomer</i>: Just as where it is permitted to wear two cloaks on top of one another [even if one is made of wool and the other of linen], yet it is forbidden [to wear a single cloak] if it is of a forbidden mixture, thus where it is forbidden to drive two [diverse species] together, does it not all the more so stand to reason that a forbidden mixture of both them should be forbidden? They said to him, behold, it says (1 Kings 1:33, JPS tr.), "and have my son Solomon ride on my mule, and bring him down to Gihon." He said to them, one cannot derive [halacha] from [actions performed] in urgency.  They said to him, it says [as to Solomon] (2 Kings 18:3), "He did what was correct in the eyes of God, like all that his father David had done, and [as to David] (1 Kings 15:5), "He never turned throughout his life from all that had been commanded him [except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite]."
A dog is a species of domesticated animal, [and] Rabbi Meir says, it is a species of wild animal.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">The printed text reads, "A dog is a species of <i>wild</i> animal, and Rabbi Meir says, it is a species of <i>domesticated</i> animal." However, these positions are opposed to the positions in the following two sentences, and the manuscripts and commentators differ as to which position should be ascribed to Rabbi Meir and the Sages. This emendation follows the more conservative approach, which is also consistent with the final halacha re: the village dog (see Minchat Bikkurim).</i> What [practical] difference is there between [the opinions of] Rabbi Meir and the Sages? Rather, one who writes over [a document gifting] his "wild animals" to his son, Rabbi Meir says he did write over his dog (i.e., include his dog in the gift), and the Sages say, he did not write over his dog.  One who writes over his "domesticated animals" to  his son, Rabbi Meir says he did not write over his dog, and the Sages say, he did write over his dog. [But the Sages agree that] a village (כופרי) dog is a wild animal.
