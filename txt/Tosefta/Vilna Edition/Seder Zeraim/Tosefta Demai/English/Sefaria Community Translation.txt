Tosefta Demai



Chapter 1

These are the leniencies with Demai (uncertainly tithed produce): wild figs, the fruit of the lotus, and azerole are presumed exempt in every place (cf. Dem. 1:1). But if they were watched over, they are liable [as Demai]. If [they happen to also be watched over by virtue of] someone protecting his field (i.e, where they happen to have grown), they are exempt. Rabbi Yosei says, wild figs from Tzipporin are liable [as Demai] because they are watched over. Rabbi Yosei son of Rabbi Yehudah says, unripe dates that are sold along with [ripe] dates are liable. And the Sages say, until they begin to ripen [lit. "to leaven"] they are exempt, [but] from [the time that] they begin to ripen they are liable.
Originally (see Dem. 1:1), vinegar from Judea was exempt because it was presumed to be [produced] from husks and stalks of pressed grapes [see Jastrow re: תמד]. [But] now, given that it is presumed to be [produced] from wine, it is liable.
The early-ripeners<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>הבכרות</b> not <b>הברכות</b> ("the blessings") (see MSS Vienna and Erfurt, GR"A)</i> as well as the late-ripeners<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>הסייפות</b>, see Minchat Bikkurim</i> from the garden are liable [but] from the plains are exempt. These are the early-ripeners: [Those that grow] until someone [is sent to] sit and watch them<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>שומר</b> not <b>שומא</b> ("estimate")</i>. [And these are the] late-ripeners: [Those that grow] from [when] the harvesters come with their cutting tools [see Minchat Yitzchak loc. cit.].  Rabbi Ilai says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, the early-ripeners are always liable because they are watched over.
[Produce purchased in] Cheziv<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">=Achziv, a border town in northern Israel, cf. Dem. 1:3</i> alone is exempt from Demai.  [But] the presumption is that [produce purchased elsewhere in] the Land of Israel is liable, unless it is known that it is exempt. [Conversely] the presumption is that [produced purchased] outside the Land of Israel is exempt until it is known that it is liable. It is presumed that [one who purchases produce from] Jewish landowners in Syria need not separate on their account, but if it is known that the majority of the produce is theirs (i.e., grown on their land), behold, it it is liable.
[A seller who] said "this is mine (i.e., from my fields)," they are liable to tithe. [A seller who said] "it is tithed," they are believed because the mouth that forbade is the [same] mouth that permitted (cf. Dem. 6:11). [Someone who] sold produce in a year of second tithe, and said, "[It was separated from] second tithe," they are believed. [Someone who] sold produce in a year of poor man's tithe, and said, "[It was separated during a year of] second tithe," they are not believed. [Someone who] sold produce in a year of second tithe and said, "[It was separated during a year of] poor man's tithe," they are believed, because the mouth that forbade is the [same] mouth that permitted.
[Someone who] was selling produce during Shevi'it<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">the seventh year of the agriculture cycle, when fields must lie fallow</i> and said that they [were grown] just before [the start of] Shevi'it, [that produce is] liable for tithing and for Bi'ur<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the act of publicly renouncing and only then reacquiring ownership over produce grown during Shevi'it</i>. [Someone who] was selling produce right after Shevi'it<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מוצאי שביעית</b> not <b>שביעית ערב</b> ("just before Shevi'it") (see MS Erfurt)</i> and said that it [was grown] after Shevi'it, [that produce] is exempt from tithing and exempt from Bi'ur. [The rule is that in a situation where] a matter about which an exemption [is derived from] a person's silence, his stringency is [also] believed; and therefore, his assertion of leniency [is also believed and renders the produce] exempt.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">See <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai_6.8.2" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.6.8.2">Y. Dem. VI.8.2</a>.</i>
Produce [grown in] the Land of Israel that is greater [in proportion] than produce [from] outside the Land [of Israel], behold, those are liable [in the laws of Demai]. Produce [grown] outside the Land [of Israel] that is greater [in proportion] than produce [from] the Land of Israel, behold, those are exempt, the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, [produce that is] consistently [brought from outside the Land of Israel], such as Damascene plums<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>דורמסקניות</b>, see Ber. 39a</i> and walnuts is exempt, and everything else is liable. Rebbi said, the words of Rabbi Meir appear [preferable] in regards to [produce] that is not constant (i.e., not consistently imported), and the words of the Sages [appear preferable] in regards to [produce that is] constant.
[One who] purchases [produce] from a caravan in Tyre or from the stores<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מוגירות</b>, see Jastrow</i> in Zidon is exempt [from the laws of Demai], [but one who purchases] from the stores in Tyre or from a caravan in Zidon is liable. Rabbi Yosei son of Rabbi Yehudah says, [one who] buys from the stores in Tyre -- and there is no need to say "from a caravan" but [even from] a single donkey-driver in Tyre -- is liable. Rabbi Yehudah says, [produce purchased from] a caravan coming down to Cheziv is liable because the presumption is that it is from the Galilee [and thus is carrying produce grown in Israel, which must be tithed].  And the Sages say, behold, it is presumed exempt until it is known [with certainty] from where it came.
[One who] purchases [produce] from a boat [docked] in Jaffa or from a boat [docked] in Caesarea<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alternatively, <b>ציפורי</b> = Tzippori/Sepphoris (see MS Erfurt)</i> is liable [in the laws of Demai]. Rabbi Yehudah says, [all produce purchased from] the archway of the Yishuv and the archway of Antipatris and the marketplace of Patros originally was [considered] Demai, because there was a presumption that it was grown in the King's Mountain<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai_5.8.6" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.5.8.6">Y. Dem. V.8.6</a></i>.  [But] now, our rabbis have held that [with respect to] all Samaritan towns that are by the side of the "Road"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>הדרך</b> (per Lieberman here, the "Road" was the major thoroughfare running from from Judea to the Galilee)</i>, their grains and their legumes are [considered] Demai because they are of Israel, but the remainder of their produce is [considered] certainly untithed.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">משתמשין ביהודה ("used in Judea") is stricken per the GR"A.</i>
[With respect to] a storehouse that Jew[s] and Gentiles deposit [their produce] inside, if the majority are Gentiles, it is [considered] certainly untithed, and if the majority are Jew[s], it is [considered] Demai. If it is half and half, it is [considered] certainly untithed, the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, even if everyone [who deposited produce were] Gentiles, and a single Jew deposits inside it, [all of the produce is considered] Demai. Rabbi Yosei said, in what context does this apply? With respect to a storehouse owned by a private citizen, but with respect to a storehouse owned by kings, we follow after [the rule of] the majority. Rabbi Yehudah said, in what context does this apply? With respect to a storehouse [belonging to] Jew[s] and Gentiles, but [with respect to] a storehouse [belonging to] Jew[s] and Samaritans, we follow after [the rule of] the majority. They said to him, [how can you say that] after you [previously] rendered the ruling on us that, "The storehouses of Yavneh [dating] from before the [Jewish-Roman] War were Demai, [even though] the majority were Samaritans, but a storehouse to which [produce] is taken from outside the Land of Israel into the Land of Israel, such as storehouses of Danab, they are liable [in the laws of Demai], according to the proportion." Rabbi Yehoshua son of Kevisai, said, every day I was reading this passage (Num. 19:19), "The clean person shall sprinkle it upon the unclean person," and I did not understand it, but only in the storehouse of Yavneh [did I come to understand it], and from the storehouse of Yavneh I learned that one pure [person] can sprinkle even onto a hundred impure [people and render them clean].
One who purchases produce in order to eat it, and [instead] decides to sell it, shall not sell it to a Gentile, and shall not feed it to livestock [belonging to] others, nor to his own livestock, unless he tithes it<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>עישר</b> not <b>עושה</b> (see GR"A)</i>. In the same way, someone who inherited produce or received it as a gift shall not sell it to a Gentile, and shall not feed it to livestock [belonging to] others, nor to his own livestock, unless he tithes it.
One may purchase a planted field from a Gentile between [the time] when [the crops first] sprout until [the time] they cease sprouting, and so too from a Jew after Shevi'it, and [need] not be concerned.  One may purchase one type of seed that disappears (i.e., disintegrates after being planted) and another type of seed that does not disappear [after being planted].<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">See <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai_1.3.2" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.1.3.2">Y. Dem. I.3.2</a>.</i>
Planting untithed [seeds] is prohibited, as is covering up untithed [seeds with dirt], as well as making [a partnership] with a Gentile with [respect to planting] untithed [seeds]. A Jew who forgot and planted untithed [seeds], they are exempt before they sprout because [the seeds] have already perished (cf. Ter. 7:7). One who buys [produce] for livestock, for wild animals, and for fowl is exempt from Demai.
A Jew may not tie up his livestock beside the livestock of a Gentile (i.e., on the Gentile's property), for if his livestock [went there] to eat on its own, [the Gentile] is not required to return it.
A Jew may rent out his livestock to a Gentile and agree with him [that the Gentile may use his livestock] on the condition of (i.e., in exchange for) the Gentile feeding it, as long as he does not say to him, "give such-and-such [amount of] barley to it (i.e., the animal)," [or] "give such-and-such [number of] sheaves [of grain] to it."
[In the case of] a Gentile who said to a Jew, "Pour oil onto my wound," [if the oil] is certainly untithed, it is forbidden, and [if the oil] is Demai, it is permitted. [If] it fell on top of his (i.e., the Jew's) own skin (lit., "his flesh"), he can rub it in and he need not be concerned.
[In the case of] a Gentile who poured oil onto a marble slab to roll around on it, once he gets up, a Jew is permitted to sit down after him.
One who buys wine to pour inside fish brine, or wine to prepare <i>aluntit</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>אילנתות</b>, a mixture of old wine, pure water and balsam (see Jastrow; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai_1.3.16" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.1.3.16">Y. Dem. I.3.16</a>)</i>, or vetch to make into powder is liable in Demai, and needless to say, [liable in] certainly untithed [produce]. [However], these [mixtures] themselves are exempt from Demai. One who buys wine or oil to apply to scabs is liable in Demai, but Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar exempts it. And this is what Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: "One who buys vetch to make into powder is exempt from Demai; one who buys wine to pour inside collyrium<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">an eye-salve (see Shab. 8:1 re: <b>הַקִּילוֹר</b>)</i>; or flour to make a poultice or a plaster, [all these are] exempt from Demai but liable as to certainly untithed produce. [However], these [mixtures] themselves are exempt from [the laws pertaining to] certainly untithed produce."<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Note: The second instance of <b>וכרשינין לעשותן טחינין</b> ("vetch to make into powder") is omitted, following the GR"A.</i>
One who buys flour for [tanning] animal hides is exempt from Demai (cf. Dem. 1:3) but liable as to certainly untithed [produce]. And with [respect to] certainly untithed [flour] that he used on animal hides, he is permitted to [continue] using it on other animal hides.
[With respect to] spiced oils<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>שמן ערב</b> (aromatics made with spices typically subject to tithing)</i>, Bet Shammai holds [the mixture] liable and Bet Hillel exempts it (cf. Dem. 1:3). Rabbi Natan says, "Bet Hillel did not exempt [tithing spiced oils] except as to balsam oil." Others say in the name of Rabbi Natan, "Bet Hillel rendered liable rose oil." [With respect to] replacements for heave offerings, or repayments of the value [of the produce] plus a fifth<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the payment for which someone who consumes Terumah unwittingly is liable (see Ter. 6:1)</i>, or the surplus of the omer [offered on the 16th of Nissan], or the two loaves [from the new wheat offered on Shavuot], or the showbreads, or the leftovers of the grain offerings [after the priests have offered the required handful]" (see Bava Kamma 110b:14),  Rabbi Shimon ben Yehudah says in the name of Rabbi Shimon, "Bet Shammai rendered liable and Bet Hillel exempted [these agricultural gifts]." And anyone who designates [any of these agricultural gifts] for second tithe, what he has done is done<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., there is no punishment but the Sages do not approve</i>.
Resin used with oil in the bathroom<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>כפת המרחץ</b> ( (see Jastrow)</i> is exempt from [the status of] certainly untithed produce, and needless to say, from [the status of] Demai. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, "Moreover, it is not rendered impure [through contact with] impure liquids."<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "impure <i>foods</i>" see GR"A</i>
The oil that the weaver smears on his fingers is liable (Dem. 1:4), [but the oil] that the wool-comber applies to wool is exempt from Demai.  Therefore, [as to] oil of Shevi'it, they may give of it to a weaver, but they may not give of it to a wool-comber.

Chapter 2

Rice in its place (i.e., wherever it grows) is permitted [without tithing] in the harbor/suburb area<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see Jastrow re <b>חולת אנטכיא</b>, following the GR"A</i> of Antioch. Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei says, "Rice in the harbor/suburb area of Antioch is permitted until Borek."<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>בורק</b> not <b>בורו</b> ("its pit") (see GR"A and cf. Dem. 2:1)</i>
One takes upon himself four obligations that are placed on him to be a "chaver" (see Dem. 2:3): (1) he does not sell terumah or ma'aser to an am ha'aretz<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">lit., "the people of the land," signifying a Jew who is not scrupulous in his or her observance, especially the laws of purity and tithing</i>, (2) he does not engage in taharot<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the preparation of foods requiring one to be in a state of ritual purity</i> at the home of an am ha'aretz, and (3) he [only] eats unconsecrated meat in a [state of] ritual cleanliness. [Note: per the GR"A, we add "(4) he does not sell [Demai] to an am ha'aretz."]
One who takes upon himself to be "trustworthy" (see Dem. 2:2) tithes what he eats and what he sells and what he buys, and does not [permit himself to be] a guest at the home of an am ha'aretz, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say, one who [permits himself to] be a guest at the home of an am ha'arez is [nevertheless] trustworthy. [Rabbi Meir] said back to them, [if] he is not even trustworthy as to himself, [how can] he be trustworthy as to others? [The Sages said back to him,] as to themselves, home owners do not refrain from eating at one another's [homes], but regardless, when it comes to their [own] produce inside their own house, they ensure that it is properly tithed.
An am ha'aretz that takes upon himself all of the obligations [of being a] chaver, and is suspected [by other chaverim] regarding [his adherence to] one of those obligations, is suspected as to all of them, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say, we don't suspect him except as to that one obligation.
A convert [others have Gentile = גוי] that takes upon himself all the obligations of the Torah, and is suspected about one of them, and even [?] about the entire Torah, behold, he is [considered to be] like a Jewish apostate.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Note: The Erfurt Manuscript contains a large gap with hash marks at "אפילו ... על התורה כולה" = "even ... about the entire Torah", indicating missing words. Compare Bekh. 30b:3.</i>
An am ha'aretz who takes upon himself all the obligations of being a a chaver except for one of them, we do not accept him. A convert [others have Gentile (גוי)] who takes upon himself all the obligations of the Torah except for one of them, we do not accept him. Rabbi Yosei son of Rabbi Yehudah says, [that is true] even if it is a small thing from [among the] fine points in rabbinic enactments<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>דקדוקי סופרים</b> (see Jastrow)</i>.    
A Kohen who takes upon himself all the ritual obligations of the priesthood, except for one thing, we do not accept him. A Levite who takes upon himself all the Levitical obligations except for one thing, we do not accept him, as it is written (Lev. 7:33), "he who offers the blood of the peace-offering, and the fat [of the peace-offering] from among the sons of Aaron shall get the right thigh as his portion." [With reference to Kohanim (following Steinsaltz to Hul. 132b:15 to Hul. 133a:2)], I have only derived [that a Kohen does not share in the priestly gifts] only [if he does not believe in the validity of] sprinkling blood and burning of fats [on the altar]. How do we know [that they are also obligated in the rites of] the pouring [of oil onto the minchah-offering], the mixing [the ingredients together], the waving and bringing [the meal offering to the corner of the altar], the removing the handful and burning [on the altar], cutting [the neck of bird-sacrifices], receiving and sprinkling [the blood], the Sotah ceremony, the breaking the red heifer's [neck], and purifying the metzora [= leper], and the lifting the hands [to bless the people] inside and outside [the Temple]? As the Torah teaches (Lev. 7:33) "[among the] sons of Aaron," that is [to say] "all the rites" that are incumbent upon the sons of Aaron. Said Rabbi Shimon, you might think [lit. "it can be"] we don't prohibit them except from partaking in the priestly gifts within the Temple; how do we know [we also prohibit them partaking in priestly gifts given] in the countryside<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Challah.4.4.17" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Challah.4.4.17">Y. Chal. IV.4.17</a></i>? As the Torah teaches (Deut. 18:4), "You shall also give him the first fruits of your new grain [and wine and oil, and the first shearing of your sheep]." Because [as it says, Deut. 18:5], "For the LORD your God has chosen him [etc.]"; thus, everyone who takes upon himself the service, he receives the gifts. All those who do not take upon themselves the service, he does not receive the gifts. During the time that the Kohanim do the will [of their Father in heaven (see GR"A)], what it says about them (Lev. 6:10), "I have given it as their portion from My offerings by fire."  What is theirs, they take, and they do not take what is mine. And during the time that they do not do His will, what is said about them (Mal. 1:10), "If only you would lock My doors[, and not kindle fire on My altar to no purpose! I take no pleasure in you—said the LORD of Hosts—and I will accept no offering from you.]"
And everyone who [attempts to] return among these, we don't ever accept them back, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehudah says, [if] they returned publicly, we accept them back, [but] if privately, we don't accept them back. Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Joshua son of Karcha say, we accept them back either way, as it is said (Jer. 3:14), "Turn back, rebellious children [declares the LORD, etc.]."
[With respect to one who] comes to take upon himself [the obligations of a chaver]<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see Minchat Yitzchak</i>, if he had always [lit. "from the beginning"] acted modestly, we accept him, and afterwards we teach him [the strictures applicable to the chaverim], and if not, we teach him first, and afterwards we accept him. [Rabbi Shimon says, either way we accept him first and then we teach him (added per the GR"A)], and we lead him (i.e., impart the halachot on him) like so: [First] we accept him regarding "wings"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">the ritual washing of hands before eating, see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.2.3.6" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.2.3.6">Y. Dem. II.3.7</a>)</i>, and after than we accept him regarding "purities"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">the preparation and consumption of food in a state of purity</i>. And if [at that point] he said, "I don't take this (i.e., "purities") upon myself, but only "wings," we still accept him. If he takes upon himself "purities" but does not take upon himself "wings," then he is not [considered] trustworthy. How long until we accept him [as a chaver]? Beit Shammai say, 30 days as to [matters of impurity involving] liquids, 12 months as to [the impurity of] clothing. And Beit Hillel say, 30 days for both.
[With respect to one who] comes to take upon himself [the obligations of a chaver], even [if he is] a Torah scholar, he needs to [formally, i.e., before another chaver] take it upon himself, but a scholar who studies (lit. "sits") in the rabbinic academy ("Yeshiva"), there is no need to for him to [formally] take it upon himself, because he already [implicitly] took it upon himself from the moment that he began studying [at the academy]. Abba Shaul says, "Even a Torah scholar does not need to take it upon himself [formally], and not only that, but even others may take it upon themselves before him" (i.e., he is worthy of having others make their formal declaration to him). One who [formally] accepts [the yoke of being a chaver] before a chavurah (i.e., a committee of chaverim), there is no need for his sons or his workers to accept in front of a chavurah, but they can accept it in front of him<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>בפניו</b> not <b>בפניו חבורה</b> ("in front of his chavurah (i.e., fellowship of chaverim)") (see MS Erfurt here)</i>. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, there is no similarity between a wayward chaver and the wayward son of a chaver. 
The son of a chaver that goes to the home of his maternal grandfather, who is an am ha'aretz, his father should not be concerned about whether they will feed him food [requiring] ritual purity. But if he knows [with certainty] that they will feed him food [requiring] ritual purity [and thus, that the food will not be ritually pure], it is forbidden, and his clothing are considered to have incurred the impurity of <i>midras</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the impurity that a <i>zav</i> (one who experiences an unnatural genital discharge) imparts to an object by treading, standing, sitting or lying upon it</i>.
[With respect to] the daughter of an am ha'aretz who marries a chaver, [or] the [former [?]] wife of an am ha'aretz who marries a chaver, [or] the servant of an am ha'aretz who is sold to a chaver, they [all] need to accept [the yoke of being a chaver] at the beginning (see Avodah Zarah 39a:17). The daughter of an am ha'aretz who marries a chaver, the wife of an am ha'aretz who marries a chaver, and the servant of an am ha'aretz who is sold to a chaver, behold, they are presumed [to maintain the strictures of a chaver] until they are suspected [of not doing so] (see <i>ibid.</i>). Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar (אלעזר not אליעזר) says, they need to accept it upon themselves at the beginning, and moreover Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Meir (see Bekh. 31b:18), it so happened that there was a woman who married a chaver and who would tie tefillin on his hand, and she married a tax collector, and she would tie tax seals on his hand. The son of a chaver that was learning [presumably, a craft] at the home of an am ha'aretz, a servant of a chaver that was learning at the home of an am ha'aretz, behold, they are [nonetheless] presumed to [maintain the strictures of a chaver] until they are suspected. The son of an am ha'aretz who was learning at the home of a chaver, the worker of an am ha'aretz who was learning at the home of a chaver, whenever they're at his (i.e., the chaver's) house, behold, they are like a chaver. [But once they] leave from his home, behold, they are like an am ha'aretz.
A chaver should not say to an am ha'aretz, "Take this loaf of bread and give it to such-and-such chaver," for we do not send Tahorot (i.e., food that requires a state of purity) in the hand of an am ha'aretz. A chaver that said to an am ha'aretz, "Take this loaf of bread and take it to such-and-such am ha'aretz," we do not allow it, as Tahorot are not permitted to an am ha'aretz.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">See <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.3.1.10" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.3.1.10">Y. Dem. III.1.10</a>.</i>
[With respect to] an am ha'aretz that said to a chaver, "Give me this loaf of bread, and we'll eat it [together]," or "[Give me this] wine and we'll drink it [together]," we do not give it to him, because there is no feeding Tahorot to an am ha'aretz. [With respect to someone who] made a vow on a loaf of bread, and said to him, "Give it to me, and we'll eat it [together]," or a melon that had been punctured [by a snake (see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.1.4.9" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.1.4.9">Y. Shab. I.4.9</a>)], and he said  to him, "Give it to me, and we'll eat it [together]," or an uncovered [jug of] wine, and he said to him, "Give it to me, and we'll drink it [together]," we do not give it to him, because we may not feed a man something that is forbidden to him [as such items are forbidden to all Jews]. Similarly, a Jew may not extend to the sons of Noah the limb [ripped from] a live animal (one of the prohibitions of the seven Noahide laws), and not a cup of wine to a Nazirite, because we do not feed a man something that is forbidden to him. And as to all of these, we do not bless [before eating] over them, and we do not say grace [after meals] over them, and we do not answer "amen" after them (i.e., after their prayers).
[A chaver allows himself to be] asked by an am ha'aretz about [the am ha'aretz's] Tahorot, provided that [the chaver] does not say to him, "Go eat it!" [or] "Go burn it!" but we can say to him [in a hypothetical fashion], "If this is what you were asking about, it is impure," or "If this is what you were asking about, it is pure."

Chapter 3

Rabbi Yosei ben HaMeshullam testified in the name of Rabbi Natan his brother in the name Rabbi Elazar Hisma, that we [chaverim] do not make Tahorot for an am ha'aretz. [In addition], do not make him Terumah dough in purity (i.e., if the am ha'aretz is a Kohen). But one can make him ritually pure but unconsecrated dough in a state of purity, separate Challah (i.e. the Kohen's portion of the dough) from it, and give it to him inside a <i>k'fisha</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>כפישה</b> (an inverted basket of twigs or on a tray, which would not be susceptible to impurity) (see Jastrow)</i> and an am ha'aretz can come and take this and that [the <i>k'fisha</i> and the dough]. Do not make him ritually pure Terumah olives<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., olives that have been set aside and consecrated to a Kohen, presumably, even if the am ha'aretz himself is a Kohen) (see Tos. Terumot 9:10; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Terumot.11.3.3" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Terumot.11.3.3">Y. Ter. XI.3.3</a></i>, but one can make him ritually pure but unconsecrated olives, separate from them the priestly portion, and give to him inside a vessel of a chaver, and the am ha'aretz can come and take both of them [the olives and the vessel].
Similarly, we do not give the priestly portion [to anyone] except to a Kohen who is a chaver, and that way we do not pay the principal and a fifth (see Lev. 4:24) except to a Kohen who is a chaver. Where a [Kohen who is an] am ha'aretz eats the priestly portion, he [must] pay the principal and a fifth to a Kohen who is a chaver, and the chaver takes Demai [as a gift] to him and thereby appeases the am ha'aretz [by offsetting the penalty].
The priestly portion of a chaver and the priestly portion of an am ha'aretz that got mixed up together, we compel the am ha'aretz to sell his portion. A Kohen (lit., "Jewish Priest") [can] share [the priestly portion] with a Samaritan Priest within Samaritan territory, because he is like one who delivers from his hand.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Per Lieberman, otherwise the entire priestly portion would go to the Samaritan, so in essence by taking a portion, the Jew is "delivering" part of the Terumah from the hand of the Samaritan.</i> However, this is not done in the Land [of Israel], lest [the Samaritans] have presumptions on (i.e., believe themselves entitled to the privileges of) the priesthood [in the Land of Israel]. But in the Land of Israel, in a place that they know him (i.e., the Samaritan Priest (perhaps implying that the population is diverse in that locale)), it is permitted to share with him.
A Jewish Priest [can] eat with a Samaritan Priest when [the food is] made in [a state of] impurity, but when [it is] made in [a state of] purity, behold, he does not eat it with him, because he feeds him the meat of an unblemished first-born [calf], and has him drink wine from a [ritually] pure fourth[-year vineyard].<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">See Deut. 15:22 and Lev. 19:24, and discussions at Bekh. 5:2 (also Bekh. 32b:10) re: first-born calf, and Ter. 3:9 and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.7.5.2" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.7.5.2">Y. Peah VII.5.2</a> re: fourth-year vineyard.</i>
Originally they (i.e., the Sages) said that [as to] a chaver that becomes a tax collector, we force him out of the chaverut [presumably, permanently], and then they reconsidered to say, that as long as he is a tax collector, he is not [even considered] trustworthy, [but once he] separates from [his office of] tax collector, behold, he is [considered] trustworthy. (Cf. Bekh. 31a:4.)
A chaver that leases from an am ha'aretz<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the chaver works the land and shares in the produce (see Dem. 6:1)</i> fig trees or vineyards<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">literally, "fig roots or vine branches" (cf. Sifra Shemini Ch. 12:2)</i>, he tithes and gives him [his portion], but he does not give him [anything] but what is his [portion].<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Note: Since the am ha'aretz presumably will not tithe, the chaver tithes the entire harvest before splitting up the remainder, as opposed to splitting up everything and then tithing, since in the latter case the chaver will need to take all the tithes out of his own portion and thus wind up with less.</i>
The son of a chaver that goes to the home of his maternal grandfather [who is an] am ha'aretz, his father should not be concerned about whether they will feed him food that is not tithed. If he had fruits in his hand, [he should] not be concerned that they are not tithed. [But] if he (i.e., the son) said to him, "Feed [this to] me," [the father first] tithes it and then feeds him.
A chaver should not serve [as a waiter] at the wedding feast of an am ha'aretz or the dinner of an am ha'aretz except when everything was in order and tithed under his control, indeed even each wine ladle [<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.2.2.7" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.2.2.7">Y. Dem. II.2.7</a> (following Guggenheimer)].  Moreover, [where there is] a chaver that serves [as a waiter] at the wedding feast of an am ha'aretz or at the dinner of an am ha'aretz, behold, it is presumed that everything is [properly] tithed.
[In contrast,] a chaver that was sitting [as a guest] at the wedding feast of an am ha'aretz -- and even if we see him take and eat food immediately, it is not presumed to have been tithed, as he may have tithed "in his heart"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., by making a mental stipulation by giving tithes in exchange for what he ate when he returns home (see Dem. 7:1 <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.2.2.7" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.2.2.7">Y. Dem. II.2.7</a>)</i>. [But in the case that] his son was dining next to him, he [must] tithe for him. [But] if thee is someone else [dining next to him], he does not tithe for him. [And if] his son was sitting in another place [not next to his father, the father still] tithes for him.
The son of a chaver that was dining at a wedding feast of an am ha'aretz [or] at a dinner of an am ha'aretz, even if we see him take [food] and eat it immediately, [or] take and drink [wine immediately], it is not presumed to be tithed, as he may have tithed "in his heart," even though they said that all these things may become a snare for others [?]. [But] if he partnered with [an am ha'aretz] in a store, behold, this (i.e., all the food) is presumed to be tithed.
An am ha'aretz that was working in the store of a chaver, even though the chaver may leave and come back, behold, this is permitted, and there is no [need to be] concerned about switching (i.e., that the am ha'aretz has secretly switched the store's tithed produce for his own untithed produce).
[If a man] was trustworthy but his wife was not trustworthy, we may purchase [produce] from him but we may not be guests at his house, and [that is so] even though the [Sages] said, behold, he is like one who dwells with a snake in a wicker basket (i.e., his wife will control what is served and he will not interfere). [If] his wife is trustworthy but he is not trustworthy, we may be guests and his house, but we may not purchase [produce] from them.  [If] he is trustworthy and one of his sons is trustworthy, or one of his (male) servants is trustworthy<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see Lieberman, <b>ואחד מעבדיו נאמן</b></i>, or one of his female servants is trustworthy, we purchase [produce] and we eat [their produce at their homes] on their word [that their produce is tithed] and we prepare food for them. [But] during Shevi'it (the seventh year of the agricultural cycle, when fields must lie fallow) as as to Taharot (foods requiring preparation in a state of ritual purity), we are not allowed to do that (i.e., trust them at their word).<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"> Note: Unlike a chaver, one who is "only" trustworthy is only trusted in regards to tithing, but not as to whether produce was grown during Shevi'it, or in matters of Taharot (see, e.g., Dem. 2:2, Dem. 2:3, Dem. 3:4).</i>
The sages did not obligate bakers to separate [from Demai produce] any more than suffices for the priestly portion [of the produce used to make the dough] and for Challah [the dough offering] (see Dem. 2:4). And they are exempt from the second [tithe]. In what context does this apply? To the seller in his [own] store or at the entrance of his house [not "store," following the Raibag of Vilna], but the seller in a bakery or in the store next to his own store, is liable in the second [tithe].
[If produce] which is usually measured out [for sale] in a large [quantity] was measured out in either a large or a small [quantity], the small quantity is treated as if it was a large [quantity] [If produce] which is usually measured out in a small quantity was measured in either a small or large [quantity], the large quantity is treated as if it was small. (See Dem. 2:5). 
These are the things that are sold in bulk: [all] types of grain. And beans are typically measured in small [quantities], the words of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say, even things that are typically measured in small [quantities] and are [then] measured in large [quantities], these may be [measured] in abundance and sold as Demai [without first tithing]. [But] if they are measured in small [quantities], behold, these are liable [in the laws of Demai (and he must tithe them first)]. Rabbi Nehemiah says, [with regards to] the sale in small [quantities], behold it is like small [quantities], and in large [quantities], behold, it is like large [quantities] (i.e., all produce sold in bulk is treated the same, and all produce sold in small quantities is treated the same, without regard to what is "typical").  Rabbi Yishmael son of Rabbi Yochanan son of Berokah says, one who sells in small [quantities], behold, he is liable [to tithe] even if he sold [a quantity as small as] as a seah and a quarter (cf. Dem. 2:5), he needs to tithe the quarter (i.e. 20 percent of the whole, reflecting first and second tithes). Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says in the name of Rabbi Yosei, baskets of figs and baskets of grapes and bushels of vegetables (see Dem. 2:5) [sold for at at least ] a nummus<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">לימין, a type of coin (see Jastrow)</i> [are considered] a large quantity, and from a nummus and lower [is considered] a small quantity. And for moist [produce], a hin [and upward] [is considered] a large quantity and from a hin and lower [is considered] a small quantity. And so it happened that Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said in the name of Rabbi Yosei, [as to] a K'liyah (=triple-thread, per Jastrow) of garlic, behold, that is [considered] a large quantity.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Presumably, several heads of garlic were tied together and sold in this fashion.</i>
They did not permit selling Demai except to a wholesale dealer. A homeowner who sells both this and that (i.e., both large and small quantities, per Lieberman) needs to tithe, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say, one wholesale dealer and one homeowner are permitted to sell [Demai] and to send it to their friend, and give it to him as a present.
[With respect to one who] sends [produce to another], whether [through] an am ha'aretz or [through] a chaver, he [presumably, the sender] needs to tithe it.  Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, [if he sends it] to an am ha'aretz, he [the sender] needs to tithe it, and [if he sends it] to a chaver, he [the chaver] needs to know (i.e., that it needs to be tithed, and therefore the sender doesn't need to tithe it). Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said, it so happened that Rabbi Yosah son of Rabbi sent me a large etrog from Tizippori, and he said, "This came into my hands from Caesarea." And I learned from this three things: first, that it was certainly untithed, [second] that it was impure, and [third] that the [messenger] only had this one [etrog] in the hands, for if he had in his hands another one, he would have taken tithes from that one for it (i.e., on behalf of the etrog that was delivered to Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel).
One who purchases from a merchant, and he says, this one is "fixed" (i.e., tithes have been taken) and this one is not fixed, even as to the one [that he says is] fixed, we don't believe [him]. [However,] one who typically sells Demai is believed.
A chaver that was selling [produce] in abundance and [which] was tithed, and he was assigned  something that was Demai, he needs to inform [the purchaser] because everything that is Demai, one needs to inform. Rabban Gamliel used to feed his workers Demai (see Dem. 3:1), and he let them know. But if a homeowner [has already] informed them about the same type [of produce (i.e., that he subsequently sells or provides them)], then he doesn't need to inform them [again]. 
[In the case of] collectors for the communal fund, they don't collect [produce] or distribute it on Yom Tov [a holiday when work is prohibited] in they way they collect and distribute it on non-sacred days, but they collect discreetly, put it into their lap, and divide it to each and every neighborhood individually.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see Mishneh Torah, Rest on a Holiday 4:26</i>
[In the case of] charity collectors (cf. Dem. 3:1), in Shevi'it [the seventh year of the agricultural cycle, when fields lie fallow], they skip (lit., "jump over") the entrances of those who eat Shevi'it-produce, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say, there is no need to be particular about those who eat Shevi'it-produce, as they even give them bread, and they take it from them, that there is no need to suspect [any] gifts, except for money and eggs. [Even] if there was a city filled with people who ate Shevi'it-produce, there [would be] no need to be particular with those who eat Shevi'it-produce. [However,] the Priests [who] collect in [a state of ritual] cleanliness need to be particular with those who eat Shevi'it-produce. 

Chapter 4

[With respect to] one who buys vegetables from an outdoor market, behold, this one spends the entire day [deciding what produce to] select, and we need not be concerned; [however] it is forbidden for him to make up his mind [while holding the produce before purchasing it (Dem. 3:2)], [since] he cannot return it, because he needs to tithe; nor can he tithe it, because [if he returns it to the seller after tithing] it will be deficient in quantity; nor can he take just one [item] with him<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., constituting Terumah (see Lieberman)</i> and leave one behind, lest another [buyer] comes and buys [the returned item], and [unwittingly] tithes already-tithed produce in exchange for untithed produce.
One who wishes to cut off leaves of vegetables in order to lighten his burden may not toss them away until he has [first] tithed them (see Dem. 3:2). Rabbi Yosei says, this is prohibited with certainly untithed produce, but is permitted with Demai.
If one finds produce on the road and picks it up in order to eat it, and then decides to tuck it away [for later], he may not tuck it away unless he has [first] tithed it. Rabbi Yosei says, this is prohibited with certainly untithed produce, but is permitted with Demai.
[With respect to] trimming vegetables in the garden [to promote growth], behold, this is permitted [without tithing the trimmings]. If [the vegetables] belong to the homeowner and are inside his house, behold, [trimming] is forbidden [without tithing]. On top of a dungheap, in any place, behold, it is permitted [to trim without tithing].  Rabbi Yosei says, [as to] cabbage that was gathered to cut off the stalks and discard [the remainder], behold, it is permitted to gather it and eat [the stalks immediately]; [however] one who decides to tuck it away [for later] shall not tuck it away until he tithes it.
Certainly untithed produce that was tithed (lit., "fixed") as Demai<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the owner thought it was Demai so he only took out Terumah of tithes (Dem. 2:4), per Minchat Yitzchak)</i>, or Demai that was tithed as certainly untithed produce (and thus took Terumah from the whole), he has done nothing<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the tithe is not effective and the status remains as it was</i>, the words of Rabbi Ya'akov (alt., "Rabbi Meir," per MS Erfurt). Rabbi Yosei says, [as to] certainly untithed produce that was tithed as Demai, nothing has happened, [but as to] Demai that was tithed as certainly untithed produce, its tithes are [considered valid] tithes, but its Terumah is not [valid] Terumah, as one may not separate Terumah after Terumah [has already been taken].<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Note: Since even an <i>am ha'aretz</i> is presumed to have separated Terumah, separating Terumah here would result in two Terumahs taken from the same produce (see Minchat Yitzchak here).</i>
The entire city sells certainly untithed produce but one [merchant sells] Demai, [if the buyer] purchases [produce from the city] and doesn't know from whom he bought it, behold, it is forbidden [to possess it without tithing]. [Therefore,] he separates Terumah and tithes and gives it to the Kohen and the remainder is his. [Where] the untithed produce and the "fixed" (i.e., tithed) produce got mixed up, or [and?] one of them was lost, he considers the remainder to be certainly untithed, [and from this] he separates Terumah, as well as the priestly portion from the first tithe, and gives it to any Kohen that he desires.
The entire city sells tithed produced but one [merchant sells] untithed produce, [if the buyer] purchases [produce from the city] and doesn't know from whom he bought it, behold, it is forbidden [to possess it without tithing]. If the whole city sells ritually slaughtered meat, and one [merchant] sells carrion, [if the buyer] purchases and does not know from whom he bought it, behold, it is forbidden [to eat]. The entire city sells ritually pure wine and one [merchant] sells impure wine, [if the buyer] purchases [wine] and doesn't know from whom he bought it, behold, it is forbidden [to drink it]. What are we talking about here? [We are referring to] a time where he purchased it and he doesn't know from whom he bought it, but if he buys it from the outdoor marketplace, we go according to the rule of the majority.
As for fruits, the Sages did not consider either smell, or looks, or taste, or value, but only plurality<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., if fruits are mixed, the obligation of tithing follows the status of the group which forms a plurality (see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai_2.1.8" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.2.1.8">Y. Dem. II.1.8</a>)</i>.
As for olives, [their status for purposes of Demai] is determined from the time they are made into oil<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>משיעסום</b> not <b>משיחסום</b> ("from the time their descent is traced") (see GR"A)</i>, [depending on whether they are pressed] in the larger olive press or in the smaller olive press<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>בד/בודידה</b> (see Sheviit 8:6)</i>, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say, neither [all] larger olive presses nor [all] smaller olive presses are comparable, either in the towns or in the provinces. The majority in the towns is not [like] the majority in the provinces; what is permitted [to buy, sell, or consume without tithing] in the towns is prohibited in the provinces<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the majority of certain species of produce in the towns is generally imported and not subject to tithes, while the majority of that same species sold in the provinces is grown in the Land of Israel and thus treated as Demai (see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai_2.1.8" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.2.1.8">Y. Dem. II.1.8</a>, and Mishneh Torah, Tithes 13:12)</i>.  [Conversely,] the majority in the provinces is not like the majority in the towns; what is permitted in the provinces is prohibited in the towns.  The majority in the mountains is not like the majority in the valleys; what is permitted in the mountains is prohibited in the valleys. [Conversely,] the majority in the valleys is not like the majority in the mountains; what is permitted in the valleys may be prohibited in the mountains.  The majority [of produce sold by] the store-owner is not like the majority [sold by] the homeowner; what is permitted [to sell without tithing] for the storeowner is forbidden for the homeowner.  [Conversely,] the majority [of produce sold by] the homeowner is not like the majority [sold by] the store-owner; what is permitted for the homeowner it forbidden for the store-owner. And this is the general rule: Whenever [foreign produce] forms the majority of it (i.e., of all produce of that species), it is permitted [to buy, sell, or consume without tithing], [and whenever foreign produce does] not form the majority of it, it is forbidden [to do so without tithing]. If [the foreign produce] formed the majority, and it diminished, the marketplace returns it to its former status<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>חזר...ליושנ</b> (see Sanhedrin 19a:12)</i>. Rabbi Yosei said, it so happened that a "threshing floor['s worth] of beans" entered Meron [from outside the Land of Israel], and they came and asked Rabbi Akiva, and he permitted them to [go to] the marketplace<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., to purchase the beans without tithing them as Demai, since the foreign beans formed the majority (see Minchat Yitzchak here)</i>. They [then] said to him, "Rabbi, it diminished" (i.e., the foreign beans are now the minority) and he said to them<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>אמר להם</b> (following GR"A)</i>, "The marketplace has returned to its former status" (i.e., all produce is again deemed Demai). Rabbi Shimon says, even if only a single "threshing floor" [of foreign produce] entered a city [and did not form a majority], the bakers are permitted [to sell it without first separating Demai (see Dem. 2:4)] because they "run after the new."<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, bakers only purchase new produce, so they need not measure <i>new foreign</i> produce against <i>all domestic</i> produce of that variety.</i>
They may combine produce [grown] outside the Land of Israel with produce [grown] inside the Land of Israel so that they form the majority over [Demai produce grown] in the Land of Israel in order to exempt them from tithes. They may combine produce [grown] outside the Land of Israel with second-year produce (i.e., produce grown in the second year of the agricultural cycle), in order that they form the majority over third-year produce to exempt them from the second tithe. They may combine from produce [grown] outside the Land of Israel with third-year produce in order that they form the majority over fourth-year produce to exempt them from the poor man's tithe<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "from tithes" (MS Erfurt)</i>. They may combine produce [grown] immediately before Shevi'it in order that they form the majority over produce [grown during] Shevi'it, to exempt them from removal (see Sheviit 7:1). They [may] combine produce [grown] outside the Land of Israel with Shevi'it produce in order that they form the majority over produce [grown] immediately after Shevi'it in order to exempt them from tithes.
If he said to him, "Sell me aged wine," and he said to him, "[This is from] last year," he is believed to be stringent, [but if he said] "[This is] four year-old [wine]" or "This is fifth year[-old wine]," he treats it as though [it is from] the season that he bought it, regardless of whether this results in being lenient or being stringent.
[The produce sold by] a merchant in every place presumed to be Demai, regardless of whether he is a Gentile or a Jew or a Samaritan. What case does this refer to? To a situation where they bring him [produce to sell] from a Jew, but if they bring him [produce to sell] from a Gentile or from a Samaritan, it is presumed to be certainly untithed. What is a "merchant"? Anyone who brings [produce] and comes back a second time and a third time<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>וְשָׁנָה, וְשִׁלֵּשׁ<b> (see Shab. 61a:16)</b></b></i><b><b>.</b></b>
One who purchases [produce] from the merchant and he (the merchant) says, "This [produce] is in order<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מתוקן</b>, i.e., Terumah and tithes have been separated and it is ready for consumption</i> and that [produce] is not in order," [it is all deemed] certainly untithed. [If he says,] "This is not tithed," one removes from it two tithes, and it is exempt from Terumah,<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>ופטורה מן התרומה</b> not <b>לפוטרן מן התרומה</b> ("in order to exempt it from Terumah") (see Minchat Yitzchak)</i> as there is no Terumah after Terumah<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., since the merchant is presumed to have already separated Terumah</i>.
[If someone] left produce at the place of an am ha'aretz, behold, it is presumed [to retain its previous status] for tithing and for Shevi'it<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see Dem. 3:4, cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Maasrot_5.1.8" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Maasrot_5.1.8">Y. Maas. V.1.8</a></i>. If it was untithed, he may take Terumah and tithes from it on behalf of [produce] in another place, and he designates the Terumah and tithes that are in it. If it was tithes from [previously] untithed produce, he may take Terumah and tithes from it on behalf of [produce] in another place, and he designates the Terumah and tithes that are in it.  If it was [produce of] second tithe, he may exchange it for money, and exchange the money for second tithe [in Jerusalem]. [If the am ha'aretz said], "I took [your produce] and left you old [produce or] tithed [produce]": If you believe that he took it, you are entitled to believe that he left [old or tithed produce in its place], but if you do not believe that he left [old or tithed produce], you are not entitled to believe that he took it [in the first place].  <i>In what case does this apply?</i> To a situation where the [chaver] came and found the same type [of produce] that he exchanged; however, if he left higher-quality [produce]<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>עגרון</b> (see Jastrow)</i> and found lower-quality [produce], or [he left] lower-quality [produce] and found higher-quality [produce], behold, he should be concerned on its account with respect to tithes and seventh-year produce.
One who leaves behind [tithed] produce at the place of a Samaritan, behold, it is presumed to [retain its status] for tithes and for Shevi'it, and if it was untithed, he takes Terumah and tithes for it from another place (i.e., from other untithed produce, see Maasr. 5:6), or he designates the Terumah portion of the tithes from it.  If it was from second tithe, he exchanges them for money, and he exchanges the money for second tithe. If [the Samaritan] says to him, "I took it and I exchanged it for you for old [produce] in its place," or "[I exchanged it] for tithed [produce]," behold, he should not be concerned on its account with respect to tithes or to Shevi'it.
One who leaves [tithed] produce at the place of a Gentile, behold, he should be concerned [that it was switched for untithed produce] as to tithes and Shevi'it. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel and Rabbi Shimon say, "The Jew's produce makes [all] the Gentile's produce Demai." (See Dem. 3:4-5.)
One who sends [tithed produce] via [lit. "with the hand of"] an am ha'aretz or via a Samaritan, there is no concern [that it was switched for untithed produce] as to tithes and Shevi'it. One who sends via a Gentile, behold, he should be concerned as to tithes and as to Shevi'it; however, [with respect to] Gentiles who transport (lit., "lower") [produce] from the threshing floor to the city, it is presumed that there is no concern as to tithes or as to Shevi'it because they are presumed to have been watched over.
One who [brings his grain to be] milled at the place (i.e., the mill) of an am ha'aretz or the place of a Samaritan, he need not be concerned about impurity (cf. Dem. 3:4). One who [brings his grain to be] milled at the place of a Gentile, behold, he needs to be concerned about impurity.
They [may] store Terumah (i.e., the portion set aside for a Kohen, which must remain pure), at the place (i.e., a grain silo) of an Israelite (non-Kohen) am ha'aretz, but they [may] not store Terumah at the place of a Kohen am ha'aretz, since he has no shame in front of it.
They [may bring their grain to be] milled or sifted<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מרקידין</b>; alternatively, <b>מפקידין</b> ("stored") (see Git. 61b.1)</i> at the place of those that eat seventh-year produce, and at the place of those who eat their own produce in a state of impurity (ibid.), but they may not mill [produce] for those who eat seventh-year produce or those who eat their own produce in a state of impurity.
One who sends produce to a chaver, and he decides to return it, he (i.e., the sender) may treat it as is (i.e., according to its prior status).  Abba Shaul says, "I would be concerned lest it be switched." Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel says, "If he has a sharecropper who knows how to tithe, but he (i.e., the landowner) does not trust him as to tithes, and he (i.e., the sharecropper) brought his produce to him, and he said, yours (i.e., your share) are tithed, he is believed [in this instance]." Rebbi says, "He is not trustworthy [according to the principle] that one who is suspected regarding [one] matter may neither adjudicate nor testify" (Bekh. 30a:3).
A person gives [his produce] to his neighbor to cook a dish for him, or dough to bake, he need not be concerned about [her switching] the leaven and the spices [that are in the dough and the pot], neither with regard to tithing, nor with regard to seventh-year produce (Chullin 6a:16). In what context does this apply? When he gave her the leaven and spices [for the dough and the cooked dish]. [But if he] did not give her leaven and spices, behold, this is cause for concern as to the leaven and the spices in regards to tithes and seventh-year-produce [as in this case the neighbor will necessarily be using her own ingredients].
[If] a person gives an innkeeper a dish to cook for him, and she puts down the pot in front of him, and empties out its contents,<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>ומנערת בה</b> (MS Vienna)</i> even [if she is a] Gentile, there is no need for concern.

Chapter 5

One who purchases produce from someone who is not trustworthy in tithes and forgot to tithe, he may ask [the seller] on Shabbat [if they were tithed] (Dem. 4:1), [and if the seller states that they were tithed, he may trust his word and] eat [the produce] on Yom Tov [that falls adjacent to Shabbat] or eat it on [that] Shabbat. [If he asks him] on a weekday [regarding the status of produce he intends to eat] on Shabbat or after Shabbat, he cannot eat it until it is tithed. [If] he asked him on Shabbat [in order to eat it on] the following Shabbat, he cannot eat it until it is tithed.
[If someone] was selling produce on Shabbat Eve at nightfall, and he said, "They are tithed," and he purchases it from him for after Shabbat, he cannot eat it until it is tithed.
 Terumat maaser of Demai which had become mixed up again [with the produce] from which it had been taken: Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says: even on a week day he may ask the seller and eat based on his word (Dem. 4:1, Kulp tr.). Furthermore, Rabbi Shimon Shezuri said, one who separates terumah and tithes and they stole his produce, he [can] go and ask [the seller regarding their status], and he may come and eat on behalf of what he separated, for just as the fear of the Sabbath is on the am ha'aretz, so too is the fear of the mixture of terumah and Hullin (unconsecrated produce) on the am ha'aretz.
An am ha'aretz who said, "This is untithed and this is terumah," [or] "This is certainly untithed and this is Demai," even though they said that a suspect in a case can neither judge nor testify (see Tos. Demai 4:21), we do not suspect a [fellow] Jew on such a thing [and he may be believed].
A Gentile who was shouting, and said "Come and buy for yourselves! This is produce from newly broken land (עזק)! This is Orlah fruit! This is fourth-year fruit!" he is not to be trusted, because he is like one who praises his own purchase, but if he says "This is from such-and-such Samaritan," [or] "I bought this from such-and-such Gentile," [or] "This comes from my own," he is trusted to be stringent, the words of Rebbi.  Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, "We do not trust him, as the words of a Gentile make no difference (lit., do not go up and do not go down)."
One who says to someone who is not trustworthy as to tithes, "Buy me [produce] from someone who tithes," or "[Buy me produce] from someone who is trustworthy," we do not trust [the messenger to carry out the order (see Dem. 4:5)]. [But if he said,] "Buy it from such-and-such a person (i.e., someone who the buyer knows to be trustworthy as to tithes)," behold, we trust [the messenger to carry out the order]. Rabbi Yosei says, "He is not trustworthy, lest he find another [seller] close [and chooses to purchase from him rather than the one to whom he was sent]." [But] Rabbi Yosei agrees that [where] one said, "Go out and eat this loaf of bread, and I will pay for it," [or] "Go out and drink a quarter-log of wine, and I will pay for it," he is believed to [follow these instructions, which serve the messenger's own interests].
[With respect to] one who enters a town and has terumah in his hand, and he does not know anyone there, and similarly, [with respect to] one who stands at the threshing floor (waiting to receive priestly donations) and has terumah in his hand and does not know anyone there, behold, he should ask for [assistance from] the <i>chaverim</i> and for the <i>amei ha'aretz</i>, the words of Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel. [But] Rebbi says, [Kohanim] do not ask [for assistance] concerning terumah except from <i>chaverim</i> only.
[If someone] was among a group of people traveling together, and said, "Who here is trustworthy?" [or] "Who here tithes?" (Dem. 4:6), and one said to him, "I am trustworthy" [or] "He (i.e., another person) tithes" (alt., "I am <i>not</i> trustworthy" [or] "he tithes" (MS Vienna)), behold, this one is believed. [If] he said to him, "He tithes" in front of him (i.e., in front of the person who he claims tithes), he is believed, and if not in front of him, he is not believed. <i>In what case does this apply?</i> In a situation that [the traveler] does not know anyone there, but if he did know someone there, he should not take from anyone except an expert<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מכיר</b>, i.e., one who has a reputation for knowing and upholding halachah (see Avodah Zarah 39b:6)</i>. <i>In what [other] case does this apply?</i> In a situation where he has not stayed there for 30 days, but [if] he has stayed there for 30 days, he should not take from anyone other than a specialist. <i>In what [other] case does this apply?</i> With respect to terumah and tithes [he may rely on an unverified statement of trustworthiness], but with respect to [the laws of] seventh-year produce and [whether foods were prepared in a state of] purity, he is not believed.
One who wishes to separate terumah, and terumah of tithes, and challah at the same time (see Dem. 5:2) takes [an amount] suitable for [the amount of] terumah or the terumah of Challah. And how much is that? One twentieth. And he says, "One hundredth part of what is here, behold, that which is on this side shall be tithe, and the remainder of the tithe is next to it, and another one forty-eighth of of what is here, behold, that which is on this side is chullin, and the remainder is terumah on the whole is terumah. One hundred[th] [of the chullin] that is here, behold, that which is on this side is tithe and the remainder of the tithe is next to it. That which I made tithe is made terumah of tithe on it and the remainder is challah. [The portion set aside for] second tithe is on the north or on the south."  And he exchanges it for money. Rabbi Shimon forbids it with [respect to] terumah of tithes, and permits it with challah (Dem. 5:3). What case does this refer to? When everyone separates [tithes], he takes [a single joint portion of] challah from everyone, but when a few separate and a few do not separate, he takes challah from each and every one.
Workers that were sitting and eating, and they left over slices [of bread], and similarly with guests that were reclining and eating and they left over slices [of bread], and they gave them to the attendant, or there were others (i.e., poor people) who were collecting [the fallen slices] under them (i.e., under where the guests had been sitting), [the attendant] tithes from each and every one. [If someone] took the bread and made [it into] crumbs, or figs and made them into fig cakes, he tithes from one on everything, said Rabbi Yehudah.  What case does this refer to? In a year of  satisfaction (i.e., when there is enough to go around (see Minchat Bikkurim)), but in the other years he tithes each and every one.
One who purchases from a poor person, and so too a poor person to whom they gave slices of bread or figs, he takes tithes from each and every one. With [respect to] dates grown in the valleys (Bikkurim 1:10), he tithes from one on behalf of everything. In other places [where the dates are of lower quality], he takes tithes from each and every one. With [respect to] figs in years of satisfaction (see above) he takes tithes from one on behalf of everything, but in the other years he tithes each and every one.
One who purchases from a merchant tithes from each and every [bread] mold <sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מכל דפוס ודפוס</b> (see Menachot 94a:11)</i>, and if [the merchant] was bringing [vegetables from various farmers] and gathering them before [the purchaser], he takes tithes from each and every cucumber and from each and every bunch [of vegetables], and from each and every date. One who purchases from a shopkeeper, and goes back and takes from him a second time, even though he recognizes the barrel [of wine], he may not tithe from this [purchase] on behalf of that [prior purchase] (see Dem. 5:6).
One who purchases from a wholesaler and decides to return [what he purchased] may not return it<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "may return it" (GR"A)</i>. <i>In what case does this apply?</i> In the case of Demai, but in the case of certainly untithed produce, behold, it is forbidden. [If] he purchased from him an <i>issar</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">a unit of money equal to 1/24 of a <i>dinar</i></i> of vegetables, [or] an <i>issar</i> of loaves, [or] an <i>issar</i> of pomegranates, and decided to return them, he may not return them, unless he tithes (lit. "fixes") them in the case of Demai, and needless to say, in the case of certainly untithed produce.
Untithed produce that gets mixed up with chullin, behold, this is forbidden [to eat] in any amount. If he had a supply in another place (cf. Hallah 3:8), he can take it according to his calculation [of the amount that got mixed up], and if not, he takes all the chullin in an amount equivalent to the [estimated amount of] terumah [and] tithes in the untithed produced. And similarly, with tithes from which terumah has certainly not been taken that become mixed up with chullin, behold, this is forbidden [to eat] in any amount, and if he had a supply in another p[lace, he can take it according to his calculation, and if not, he takes the chullin according to the [estimated amount of] terumah of tithes [that needed to be separated].
Vegetables of chullin that are cooked in untithed oil, behold, this is forbidden in any amount. If he has a supply in another place, he can take it out according to the precise amount (Hallah 3:8), and if not, [as to] something that [can be] mixed in [with oil], he mixes it and takes [the precise amount], and [as to] something that cannot be mixed [with oil], he takes from that [very] stalk or cut or egg.
[If] a man says to his fellow<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alternatively, <b>לחמוריו</b> ("to his donkey-driver") (MS Erfurt)</i> or to his workers, "Go and eat [what I purchased with] this <i>dinar</i>," or "Drink [what I purchased] with this <i>dinar</i>," [they should] not be concerned about [whether he is careful about] tithes or about <i>shevi'it</i>, or about the wine of libation [of a Gentile], but if he said, "Go and eat this loaf of bread and I will pay for it," or "Go and drink this <i>revi'it</i> [of wine] and I will pay for it," behold, he is suspected as to <i>shevi'it</i> and tithes and as to the wine of libation.
One who gives wool to a Gentile dyer, there is no concern that he may have dyed it using the vinegar of libation wine [used in idolatry], but if they entered into extensive calculations<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., regarding the specific cost of the ingredients of the dye (see Minchat Yitzchak here)</i>, it is prohibited.
A person does not give the terumah of his wine vat<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>גיתו</b> not <b>ביתו</b> ("his house") (see MS Erfurt)</i> to the [Kohen] guardian of his wine vat, and not the first-born sheep of his flock to the [Kohen] shepherd of his flock. If he has paid them their wage, [if] he wanted, he may give it to them as a favor. An Israelite does not give his livestock to a Kohen butcher to slaughter, and not to a Kohen shepherd to shepherd for him, unless he pays them their wage.
The leaders of Israel may say to a Kohen, "Here you have this <i>sela</i> and give terumah to my daughter's son, a Kohen," or "Give this first-born to my daughter's son, a Kohen," Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, "I say that this is so even as to priestly gifts from the Holy Temple." <i>How is this done?</i> [The leader would say,] "It is incumbent upon me [to sanctify] these 200 <i>zuz</i> [toward the purchase of] all the priestly gifts." The leaders [of Israel may also] say to him, "Here you have this <i>sela</i> and give them (i.e., the priestly gifts) to the son of my daughter, a Kohen.
An Israelite that was selling his olives against 60 <i>logs</i> of untithed produce, and a Kohen said to him, "I will give you 60 <i>logs</i> of tithed produce [for the olives], and let the tithes be mine" -- the tithes are his, and he need not be concerned about seventh-year produce, nor about [the prohibition of] selling on interest, nor about destroying the sanctity [of the tithes].
We [may] separate terumah of tithes from an expensive place to a cheap place, or from a cheap place to an expensive place. <i>How is this done?</i> [If] he had nine <i>kors</i> in Judea, and one in the Galilee, or nine kors in the Galilee and one in Judea, he says, "The <i>kor</i> that is is in Judea is made terumah of tithes on the nine <i>kors</i> that are in the Galilee," or "The <i>kor</i> that is is in the Galilee is made terumah of tithes on the nine <i>kors</i> that are in Judea." Furthermore, they said [if] he has two friends, one in Judea and one in the Galilee, and he has two <i>kors</i>, one in Judea and one in the Galilee, he says, "For this one that is in Judea, come and take for yourself the <i>kor</i> that is in the Galilee, and for this one that is in the Galilee, come and take for yourself the <i>kor</i> that is in Judea." And he goes back and takes [terumah] from them according to the measurement of [whichever location is] the cheap one.
We do not redeem the second tithe in an expensive place for an inexpensive price. We do not redeem [first tithe] from a Levite in an expensive place for an inexpensive price.
[With respect to] Kohanim and Levites who were assisting between threshing floors, [the landowners should] not give them terumah and tithes [as part of] their salary, and if they gave them, behold, they are [deemed] unconsecrated [produce], as it is said (Num. 18:32), "and you shall not profane the sacred donations of the Children of Israel," [and treated as though] they were already unconsecrated. And it is said (Mal. 2:8), "You corrupted the covenant of the Levites, said the Lord of Hosts." More than this, they (i.e., the Sages) said, "Their terumah is not terumah and their tithes are not tithes," and not only that, but the Sages [also] sought to punish them such that they would need to separate terumah from their own produce.  And about them it is written, saying (Micah 3:11, JPS tr.), "Her rulers judge for gifts, Her priests give rulings for a fee, [And her prophets divine for pay]," and therefore God brought on them three punishments corresponding to their three sins that they committed, as it is said (Micah 3:12, JPS tr.), "Assuredly, because of you, Zion shall be plowed as a field, [And Jerusalem shall become heaps of ruins, And the Temple Mount a shrine in the woods]."
We may tithe [certainly untithed produce] from a Jew on behalf of [produce bought from] a Samaritan [which is also certainly untithed]; and [certainly untithed produce] from a Samaritan on behalf of [certainly untithed produce bought from] a Jew (Dem. 5:9); and [following the same formula] from a Jew on behalf of a non-Jew; and of a non-Jew on behalf of a Jew, and of everyone on behalf of everyone else, the word of Rabbi Meir. [But] Rabbi Yehudah, and Rabbi Yosei, and Rabbi Shimon say, we may tithe [certainly untithed produce] from a Jew on behalf of [certainly untithed produce from] another Jew; from a Samaritan on behalf of another Samaritan, and from a Gentile on behalf of another Gentile; but not from a Jew on behalf of a Samaritan, and not from a Samaritan on behalf of a Jew, and not from a Gentile on behalf of a Jew, and not from a Jew on behalf of a Gentile. Said Rabbi Shimon Shezuri, it so happened that my untithed produce got mixed up [with tithed produce], and I came and asked Rabbi Tarfon [what to do]. He told me, go and buy produce from the market and tithe it on behalf of them (i.e., the mixed-up produce). Rabbi Eliezer says<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>אוסר not אומר</b> (MS Erfurt)</i>, with respect to produce from a Samaritan, just as they convert a Jew's produce into Demai following their majority, and one may not take terumah or tithes from one on behalf the other, so too a Samaritan's produce are tithed as certainly untithed produce following their majority, and one may not take terumah or tithe one on behalf of the other. 
Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel says, in a place where a Samaritan's produce became Demai<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>דמאי</b>; alternatively, <b>ודאי</b> ("certainly untithed") (see GR"A)</i>, such as the vegetables that are in Kefar Othney, one may tithe from them on behalf of [a Jew's] untithed produce, but [one may not tithe a Jew's] untithed produce on behalf of [a Samaritan's produce]. <i>In what case does this apply?</i> When one takes produce from the market, but one who finds produce inside his home [of which we are unsure of the status], or his friend sends it to him [and we do not know if the friend tithed it first], we treat them as Demai.
Rabbi Shimon said, Three decrees [were enacted] as to Demai: It so happened that our rabbis found themselves in the townships of the Samaritans that are near the [road to the] Jordan, and [the Samaritans] brought vegetables before them. Rabbi Akiva jumped up and tithed them as certainly untithed produce. Rabban Gamaliel said to him, "Akiva! How did your heart induce you to contradict the opinion of your colleagues?<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., as the Sages had previously held that the produce of Samaritans is treated only as Demai, such that terumah need not be removed (Minchat Yitzchak)</i> Or who gave you permission to tithe?" He said to him, "Is the law thus established in Israel?" He said to him, "I [merely] tithed my own vegetables."<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., he was being stringent on himself, but did not intend to establish the law for others (Minchat Yitzchak).</i> He said to him, "You should know that you established a law in Israel when you tithed your vegetables." When Rabban Gamaliel walked amongst them, he rendered their grain-produce and legume-produce Demai, and the rest of their produce certainly untithed. But when Rabban Gamaliel<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel" (MS Erfurt)</i> returned to them and saw that they had ruined [the tithe], he rendered all of their produce certainly untithed.
[Produce grown in a] perforated pot is liable in tithes, and their terumah does not create "doubtful terumah" (medumma), and [one who consumes it] is not liable for the added fifth.

Chapter 6

One who receives a field from a Gentile (i.e., to perform work on in exchange for a share of the yield) tithes [first] and [then] gives [the Gentile's portion] to him (but see Dem. 6:1).  Said Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel, "What if this Gentile [does not agree and] wants that the produce not be tithed [first]? [In this case,] rather [the Jew should] divide [the produce first] and give it to him directly<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">although here the Jew would only be able to take tithes from his own portion, resulting in his share being smaller than the Gentile's share</i>.
One who divides a field from a Gentile tithes [first] and [then] gives [the Gentile's portion] to him. Rabbi Shimon says, "He takes Terumah (i.e, the priestly portion) and [then] gives it to him." Therefore, if the Gentile returned and converted [to Judaism], or sold [the field] to a Jew, he tithes [first] and [then] he gives [the Gentile's portion] to him. [If the Jew] leased the field from him, he [first] tithes and [then] gives [the Gentile's portion] to him. What is the difference between "leasing" (שוכר) and "hiring" (חוכר)?  One "leases" with money, and one "hires" with produce.
One who hires a field from a Gentile, [first] tithes and [then] gives [the Gentile's portion] to him.  Therefore, if the Jew returned and took [a portion of that produce] from him or if [the Gentile] sold [it] to a different Jew, we treat [that produce] as Demai.
One who hires a field from a Samaritan, [first] tithes and [then] gives [the Samaritan's portion] to him.  One that pays [taxes] to the [Roman] treasurer or to the Centurio, gives first the tithes and pays his taxes [on the remainder] (see <a class="Jastrow%2C_קִטְּרוֹנִים?ven=London,_Luzac,_1903&amp;lang=bi" href="Jastrow%2C_קִטְּרוֹנִים?ven=London,_Luzac,_1903&amp;lang=bi">Jastrow re: קִטְרוֹן</a>).
A Jew [should] not say to a Samaritan  or to a Gentile or to someone who is not trustworthy as to tithing (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai_6.8.10" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.6.8.10">Y. Dem. VI.8.10</a>), "here you have 200 <i>zuz</i> and pay for me to the treasury," but he [may] say to him, "free me from the treasury" (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai_6.8.10" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.6.8.10">ibid.</a>, Guggenheimer tr.).  Likewise, a man [should] not say to his friend, "here you have 200 <i>zuz</i> and pay the <i>leiturgia</i>"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>אומנות</b>, i.e., obligations forced upon private citizens by the government, including providing food and wine to officials or troops, see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai_6.8.10" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.6.8.10">ibid.</a></i>, but he [may] say to him, "free me from the <i>leiturgia</i>.”
One who receives a field from a Jew  (i.e., to perform work on in exchange for a share of the yield), [first separates] Terumah and [then] gives [the field owner the remainder of his portion (see Dem. 6:1)]. Rabbi Meier says, "He tithes and gives him." Rabbi Yehudah says, "If he gives [the field-owner his portion of the yield] from the same field and from the same species, he [first separates] Terumah and [then] gives him. If from a different field or from a different species, he [first] tithes and [then] gives him" (Dem. 6:1). But the Sages say, "If [the produce given as payment is] from the same field [harvested], he gives it to him [as follows]: Whether from the same species or from a different species, he [separates] Terumah and gives him. And if it is from a different field he gives it to him [as follows]: Whether from the same species or from a different species, he tithes and gives him." If he received from [another Jew] seed [in exchange for] produce [already] in the threshing floor, he tithes and gives him. [However,] if from a place that they divide up the threshing floor, he gives him his portion in front of him. If he received from [the Jew] money to give him [in exchange for] produce [already] in the threshing floor, everyone agrees that he tithes and gives him.
A Jew that receives a field from his friend  (i.e., to perform work on in exchange for a share of the yield) to harvest husks of grain, [or] a vineyard to gather in grapes, [or] an olive [orchard] to ascend [to gather] the olives, gives [his friend his portion] as they are (i.e., without separating tithes or Terumah). [But if he receives] a field [from his friend] to harvest wheat, a vineyard to harvest for wine, [or] an olive [orchard] to to ascend [to gather] for oil, he tithes first and then gives [his friend his portion.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Note: In the former case, the products are in their unfinished state and not yet subject to tithing.  However, if the case of a worker who takes his wages in the form of the finished product (threshed wheat grain, wine, or oil), this is after the obligation of tithes started (see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai_6.1.6" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.6.1.6">Y. Dem. VI.1.6</a>, Guggenheimer tr.).</i>
Rabbi Yosei ben HaMeshullam testified in the name of his brother Rabbi Nathan, who said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer ben Hasma (alt., "R. Eliezer Hasma"), "If one rented from a Gentile a field which had formerly belonged to his fathers [for a share in the produce], he gives him (i.e., the Gentile his portion) as they are (i.e., without separating tithes or Terumah)."<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">But see Dem. 6:2 ("he [first] separates tithes and [then] gives it to him").</i>
A chaver and an am ha'aretz that inherited from their father who was an am ha'aretz, [the chaver] does not have the right (but see Dem. 6:9) to say to him, "You take the wheat in such-and-such a place and I will take the wheat in such-and-such [other] place" [or] "[You take the] wine in such-and-such a place and I [will take the] wine in such-and-such [other] place." But they receive an equal share, and the chaver even divides it in front of [the am ha'aretz]. [In such a situation,] the chaver [should] eat the dry [produce] and burn the moist produce [which is susceptible to impurity], because they said, "All the Tahorot of an am ha'aretz is burned."
They [a chaver and an am ha'aretz] inherited from their father who was a chaver, [the chaver] has the right to say, "You take the wheat that is in such-and-such a place and I [will take] the wheat that is in such-and-such [other] place" [or] "[You take the] wine in such-and-such a place and I [will take the] wine in such-and-such other place," even though they said, "a chaver that dies and leaves sons who are chaverim and amei ha'aretz, the amei ha'aretz does not pass on Tahorot to the amei ha'aretz, but only to the chaverim." If he leaves second-tithe produce, [the chaver] has no right to say to [the am ha'aretz], "You take the wheat and I will take the barley," [or] "you the wine and I the oil" (cf. Dem. 6:9), but he [may] say to him, "You take money from [the sale of the] wheat, and I will take the money from [the sale of] the barley," [or] "you the money from the wine and I the money from the oil."
A chaver and someone who is not trustworthy as to tithes that took produce that they had [jointly] inherited, or as to which they were partners, [the chaver] has the right to say to [the untrustworthy one], "You take the wheat, and I the barley," [or] "You the wine, and I the oil"; indeed [as to] any item [of produce] that one is permitted to sell as Demai, one may act in such a way. [As to] a pile of grain, a vessel of grapes, or a vat of olives<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see <a class="Jastrow%2C_מַעֲטֵן?ven=London,_Luzac,_1903&amp;lang=bi" href="Jastrow%2C_מַעֲטֵן?ven=London,_Luzac,_1903&amp;lang=bi">Jastrow re: מַעֲטֵן</a>, i.e., where olives are packed until they form a viscid mass</i>, each one tithes his own. If they [each] took [their own portion] and afterwards became partners (e.g., to sell the resulting wheat, wine, or oil), [the chaver] needs to tithe everything. If this one brought his own early ears [of wheat] (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai_6.1.7" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.6.1.7">Y. Dem. VI.1.7</a>, Guggenheimer tr.), and that one brought his won early ears, [or] this one brought his own baskets of olives, and that one brought his own baskets of olives, [or] this one brought his own baskets of grapes, and that one brought his own baskets of grapes, or they collected [grapes of] their vineyards inside a single winepress (see Dem. 6:7), one who tithes and who does not tithe, the one who tithes [should] tithe his portion as certainly untithed produce, and half of the portion of his friend as Demai.
A convert and a Gentile that inherited from their Gentile father, [the convert] has the right to say to [the Gentile], "You take the idols and I [will take] the utensils," [or] "You the wine and I the fruits" (cf. Dem. 6:10).  Onkelos the Convert divided [his Gentile father's inheritance] with his [Gentile] brothers, and was stringent on himself.  He cast his portion into the Dead Sea.  If they inherited a thermal bath<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מרחץ</b> (see Avodah Zarah 3:4)</i>, [the convert] has the right to say to [the Gentile], "Let it be your portion on Shabbat, and my portion on the weekdays."
A Jew and a Gentile that [jointly] bought a house of a Gentile, [the Jew] has no right to say to [his Gentile partner], "You take the idols, and I [will take] the utensils," [or] "You the wine and I the produce." [If] they bought a thermal bath, he has no right to say to him, "It will be your portion on Shabbat and it will be my portion on the weekdays." But if they entered into [such an arrangement] from the beginning to do so, it is permitted.
A town that has in it Jews and Gentiles, guardians of Jews (see Psalms 121:4) and guardians of Gentiles, those who tithe and those who do not tithe, [or] guardians who tithe and guardians who do not tithe, they have the right to say, one to the other, "the north of the town is our portion and the south [of the town] is your portion." [But] if they started calculating (cf. Bava Batra 78b:13), it is forbidden [to say this].

Chapter 7

A Yisrael (i.e., a Jew who is neither a Kohen or Levi) who received a field from [another] Yisrael [to work the land in exchange for a share of the yield, i.e., as a sharecropper], or a Kohen [who received a field] from a Kohen, or a Levite from a Levite -- they divide [the harvest] between them [evenly]. A Yisrael and a Kohen that [jointly] received a field from a Levite, or a Yisrael and a Levite who [jointly] received a field from a Kohen -- they have the right to arrange between them that [each of them will be responsible for] his own tithes.
A Yisrael who received a field from a Kohen [as a sharecropper] -- the Terumah goes to the Kohen, [and the] first and second tithes are divided between them. One who received a field from a Levite -- the first tithe, Terumah, and second tithe are divided between them. A Levite who received a field from a Kohen, the Terumah goes to the Kohen, and the first and second tithes are divided between them. A Kohen who received a field from a Levite, the first tithe goes to the Levite, and the Terumah and second tithe are divided between them.  A Yisrael that received a field from a Kohen and told him [that he received it] on the condition that "the tithe is mine," on the condition that "the tithes are yours," on the condition that "the tithes are mine and yours" -- this is forbidden.  A Kohen who received a field from a Yisrael on the condition that "the tithes are mine" -- this is permitted; on the condition that "the tithes are yours" -- this is forbidden; on the condition that "the tithes are mine and yours" -- if he purchased it in the manner [that it is customarily purchased], it is permitted, and if not, it is forbidden.
A Yisrael that received a field from a Kohen [as a sharecropper] on the condition that "I [the Yisrael] will take the tithes and I will give them to so-and-so" -- this is forbidden. A Yisrael that received a field from a Kohen and said, "on the condition that I and you will take [the tithes] and give them to so-and-so" -- this is permitted. A Kohen and a Levite who leased or hired (see Tos. Demai 6:2) [a field] from a Kohen or from a Levite -- the tithes are for the one who leased or hired [the field].
A Kohen or a Levite who sold the produce of their field to a Yisrael, [as to anything] connected to the ground, the tithes are theirs, [and as to anything] not connected to the ground, until he smooths [the pile] (see Sanhedrin 88a:13) -- the tithes are his. He separates Terumah and tithes and gives it to the Kohen, and the remainder is his.
[If] he sells to them produce, until he smooths [the pile], behold, the tithes are his, [and] that which he smooths [of the pile], behold that is theirs. He separates Terumah, and Terumah from the tithe, and gives to whatever Kohen he desires.
A Yisrael that received money from a Kohen to purchase produce with it [in exchange for] half the profits [from the resale], [and] he said to him, "if they (i.e., their value) go down or up, it is on my account, and the tithes are yours" -- this is permitted<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">following <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai_6.4.4" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.6.4.4">Y. Dem. VI.4.4</a> and GR"A</i>.  A Kohen that received money from a Yisrael to purchase produce with it [in exchange for] half the profits, [and] he said to him, "if they go down or up, it is on my account, and the tithes are yours," if he gave him his [portion of the] profits, it is permitted, and if not, it is forbidden.
A Yisrael that received a field from a Kohen [as a sharecropper], the Terumah goes to the Kohen. [If] the Kohen sold [the field] to the Yisrael, they divide [the Terumah] equally. [If a Yisrael] receives a field [as a sharecropper] from [another] Yisrael, they divide [the Terumah] between them (presumably, they may negotiate the proportion). [If a Yisrael] receives a field [as a sharecropper] from a female Yisrael (lit., a "daughter of Israel"), they divide [the Terumah] equally. [If that female Yisrael then] marries a Kohen, the Terumah goes to the Kohen. If [a Yisrael] receives a field from a female Kohen (lit., "a daughter of a Kohen"), the Terumah goes to the female Kohen. [If that female Kohen then] marries a Yisrael, [the Yisrael sharecropper and the Yisrael who married the female Kohen] divide [the Terumah] between them. [If] she becomes widowed or divorced, [the arrangement] reverts back to its original state.
[In the case of] a cow of a Kohen that was put in a Yisrael’s care [on the condition that the Kohen and the Yisrael share the profits from the offspring] and that gave birth to a firstborn calf, the firstborn calf belongs to the Kohen, the words of Rabbi Yehudah. (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai_6.4.3" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.6.4.3">Y. Dem. VI.4.3</a>). But the Sages say, the firstborn calf belongs to both of them. Rabbi Yehudah said to them, "Do you not agree that the produce [per Yerushalmi, "tithes"] of the field is his?" They said back to him, "The body of the field is his, and the body of the cow belongs to both of them. Nevertheless, if the body of the cow belonged [solely] to him (i.e., the Kohen, see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai_6.4.3" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.6.4.3">ibid.</a>), its firstborn would belong to the Kohen."
[In the case of] one who gives his field for [for purposes of] being sharecropped by a Samaritan or a Gentile<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">so MS Erfurt and printed versions, but see GR"A (striking "or a Gentile")</i>, or to someone who is not trustworthy as to tithes, even though he is not permitted to do so, even though [the produce is still premature and] not yet subject to tithes (see Peah 4:8), he needs to tithe it himself when it [ripens and] becomes subject to tithes. [In the case of] one who gives his field for [purposes of] being sharecropped by an am ha'aretz, until the time that [the produce] becomes subject to tithes, he needs to (but see GR"A, "he does not need to") tithe it himself, [and] when it does become subject to tithes, there is no need for him to (but see GR"A, "he needs to") tithe it himself. How [does he do this]? He stands on the threshing floor, and takes [the tithes]. And we are not concerned that someone may have eaten [some of the produce before it reached the threshing floor], as we are not responsible for deceivers.
A Kohen who sold a field to a Yisrael on the condition that the tithes are his forever, and he dies, the tithes do not go to his sons [following the GR"A]. [If] on the condition that the tithes go to his sons and he dies, the tithes [do indeed] go to this sons. [If] on the condition that the "tithes are mine the entire time the field is yours (i.e., belonging to the Yisrael), and [the Yisrael] sells it to another, even though [the Yisrael then] came back and bought it [back from the other person], [the Kohen] does not receive any tithes [after the initial sale].
A Yisrael who received his field from a Kohen<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">but see MS Erfurt and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai_6.2.13" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.6.2.13">Y. Dem. VI.2.13</a> ("A Yisrael who <i>sold</i> his field to a Kohen")</i>, [and the Yisrael] said to him [that the sale is] on the condition that "the tithes are mine for four or five years," that is permitted.  [But if he said] "forever," that is forbidden, since no Kohen can make a Kohen (i.e., a non-Kohen cannot obtain a permanent right to tithes, thereby becoming like a Kohen). And likewise the son of a Levite that owed money to a Yisrael, he may not separate on his account [and take his portion of tithes as recompense], for no Levite can make a Levite (see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin_3.7.2" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Gittin.3.7.2">Y. Git. III.7.2</a>).
A Yisrael [may] separate [tithes] -- whether with the permission of the Levite or the permission of the poor -- and account for it at the end, the words of Rabbi Meier. [And] Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon forbid it, but if [he does it anyways] he gives [the Levite or the poor person] an [additional] tenth.
A Kohen who sold his field to a Yisrael, and said to him, "[I am selling you my field] on the condition that the tithes shall be mine for four or five years," [the Yisrael] does not have have a right [absent the Kohen's consent] to plant a vineyard or sow wheat, or make it into a field of reeds."  [But if he said] "forever," he does have the right to plant a vineyard or sow wheat or make a field of reeds (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai_6.2.12" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.6.2.12">Y. Dem. VI.2.12</a>).

Chapter 8

[If] an am ha'aretz who said to a chaver, "Buy me a bunch of vegetables," [or] "[Buy me] a loaf of bread," Rabbi Yosei says, there is no need [for the chaver] to tithe [what he purchased for the am ha'aretz, see Dem. 6:12]. Rabbi Yehudah says, he needs to tithe. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel says, if he exchanges the money (i.e., he uses his own money rather than the am ha'aretz's money to purchase the vegetables or the bread, see Minchat Yitzchak here), he needs to tithe.
[If] five said to one, "Go and bring us ten loaves of bread" [or] "[Go and bring us] ten bunches of vegetables," [and] he brings each one to his face (i.e., he brings that person what was purchased with that person's money), [then the] chaverim that are among them (i.e., among the purchasers) do not need to tithe except for their own portions. [But if] he brings them mixed together [so that he cannot tell which produce was purchased with which money], [then] the chaverim that are among them need to tithe on everything.  If they gave him one in addition (i.e., the seller delivered one more item than was ordered, e.g., a baker's dozen), Rabbi Yehudah says, "It belongs to the messenger," and Rabbi Yosei says, "It is in the middle"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., they all divide it, see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai_6.8.6" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.6.8.6">Y. Dem. VI.8.6</a> (<b>רִבִּי יוֹסֵי אוֹמֵר שֶׁל שְׁנֵיהֶן</b></i>.
One who invites his friend to eat at his place, and [the friend] does not trust [the host] as to tithes, [the friend] says (i.e., makes the following declaration of intent) on Sabbath Eve (see Dem. 7:1, Kulp tr.): "What I will separate (alt., "What I will eat," see Lieberman) tomorrow, behold, it is tithes, and this [produce] is tithes for it, and what  is nearest to it shall be the rest of the tithe. That which I made tithe will become <i>terumat ma'aser</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., terumah taken from the Levite's portion of tithes, as opposed to <i>terumah gedolah</i>, terumah taken from the entire produce</i> for the whole, and the second tithe is to the north or to the south and it shall be exchanged for money." Said Rabbi Yehudah, "How is it that he can tithe something that has not come into his hand?" [But] Rabbi Yehudah concedes that he can go back and buy from the place that [the host] bought [the produce that will be served on Shabbat, and take tithes from that in exchange for what he will eat on Shabbat].  [If] they poured him a cup [of Demai wine], he says, "What I will leave at the bottom of the cup shall be tithe, and what is nearest to it shall be the rest of the tithe. That which I made tithe shall become <i>terumat ma'aser</i> for the whole, and second tithe is at the mouth of the cup, and it is exchanged for money."<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">See Dem. 7:2, Kulp tr.</i>
A worker that was working at the place of a homeowner and [the worker] does not trust [the homeowner] as to tithes, Rabbi Yosei says, [this is the subject of] a ruling of the bet din, that he should take the priestly portion of the first tithe from [the portion of the produce] belonging to the homeowner, and the priestly portion of the second tithe from [the portion of the produce] belonging to the worker.
One who purchases [one hundred <i>logs</i> of] wine from Samaritans on Sabbath Eve [that he intends to drink on Shabbat], and he forgot to separate [tithes from it], says, "Two <i>logs</i> that I will separate in the future, behold, they are terumah, and the ten [<i>logs</i>] closest to them are first tithe, and the nine [<i>logs</i>] closest to them are second tithe." And he deconsecrates [the second tithe and transfers its sanctity to money], and he may drink it immediately [relying on the separation that he will perform later], the words of Rabbi Meir. (Sukkah 23b:5, Steinsaltz tr.) But Rabbi Yehudah, Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon prohibit [this]. They said to him, to Rabbi Meir, "Do you not concede that if the wineskin bursts [before he has tithed it], he will have drunk from untithed produce?" He said to them, "When it bursts, [I will be concerned]." (Sukkah 24a:6.)
One who had untithed figs inside his house, and he was in the house of study or in the field [may] declare, "Two figs that I will separate in the future, behold, they are terumah, and the ten that are closest to them are first tithe, and the nine that are closest to those are second tithe." [If] they were demai, he [may] declare, "What I will separate tomorrow, behold, it is tithe, and the remainder of the tithe is that which is next to it. That which I made tithe is [now] made <i>terumat ma'aser</i> on behalf of it (i.e., the remainder), and the second tithe is to the north or south of it, and it shall be exchanged for money<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>ומחולל על הַמָּעוֹת</b> (see MS Erfurt and Dem. 7:5), not <b>ומחולל על המותר</b> ("and it shall be exchanged for the <i>permitted</i>")</i>.
He takes terumah and <i>terumat ma'aser</i> and places it in a concealed location, and likewise for pure terumah as well as impure terumah (cf. Ter. 8:8).
A person should not drip oil inside a new candelabrum, and not inside a bonfire, and not inside any damaging agents, unless<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>אֶלָּא אִם כֵּן</b> (see MS Erfurt) not <b>אבל</b> ("but")</i> he designates the <i>terumat ma'aser</i> that is in it before it [the oil] reaches the earth. Likewise, one who had ten casks of impure, untithed wine<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see Bava Kamma 115b:7 with Minchat Bikkurim here</i>, or of  pure unithted [wine], and he sees that one of them spilled or was exposed, he [should] say, "Behold, I am making this <i>terumat ma'aser</i> on these nine [other casks]. But with regard to oil, he may not do this because of the Kohen's loss, and if he said, "Behold, this is <i>terumat ma'aser</i> [etc.]," he has not said anything.
[If] he saw someone that separated terumah and tithes and said, "I am hereby [separating] as much as he said," then his statement takes effect [and he is bound to comport himself according to the first person's declaration of intent]." Rabbi Yosei said, this [<i>halachah</i>] is in reliance on a ruling [handed down by] the beit din.
One who gives too much in tithes, his tithes are in good order but his produce is ruined (i.e., for consumption). One who gives too little in tithes, his tithes are ruined but his produce is in good order.
One who designates the dregs [at the bottom of] a barrel [of wine as terumah and tithes], he is forbidden from drinking from the mouth [of that barrel of wine). [One who designates the wine that is at] the mouth [of the barrel as terumah and tithes], he is forbidden from drinking from the dregs [of the barrel], because liquids become mixed [and therefore, he consecrates the entire barrel by designating any part of it as terumah and tithes]. But one who designates the "dregs" of a storeroom<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מגורה</b>; alternatively,  <b>קדרה</b> ("pot") (see MS Erfurt)</i> [of grain] may eat from the "mouth" [of the storeroom], [and one who designates] the "mouth" [of the storeroom] may eat from the "dregs" [since dry produce does not mix together].
There were before him two baskets of tevel (i.e., untithed produce, Dem. 7:6): In this [basket] one hundred and in that [basket] one hundred. He took terumah from both of them, and [then] says, "the tithes from this one are in that one," the first [basket] is thus tithed.  [If he says,] "[the tithes from] this one are in that one, and [the tithes from] that one are in this one," the first one is not tithed. He [thus] takes two figs [and] two tenths, and a tenth of a tenth. [If he said,] "The tithes of each basket are in the the other [basket]," he has [properly] designated [the tithes of both baskets], [and] he takes twenty figs from whichever one of them he desires [as tithes]. [If there are] one hundred in this [basket] and two hundred in [that basket], then if he takes [tithes] of the smaller [basket out of the larger basket], he takes out eleven, and if he takes [tithes] of the larger [basket out of the smaller basket], he takes it all out [and] he [still] has not fulfilled [his obligation]. [If there are] one hundred in this one and one thousand in that one, then if he takes [tithes] of the smaller [basket out of the larger basket], he takes out  fifteen, and if from the larger [basket out of the smaller basket] he takes out all sixty from this one and afterwards [finishes taking] according to the calculation.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Note: The commentators note that the instructions for the larger baskets appear to have been switched through scribal error, such that "he takes it all out [and] he [still] has not fulfilled [his obligation]" properly refers to the basket of 1000, and "he takes out all sixty from this one" refers to the basket of 200, and further amend 60 (ששים) to 30 (שלשים), i.e., 10 percent of the whole (and see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai_7.6.6" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.7.6.6">Y. Dem. VII.6.6</a>).</i>
If he had in his hand a basket of fruits that were not tithed, he takes two ninths of this one and one ninth of that one. Of the one ninth, whether untithed produce predominated over <i>chullin</i> produce, or vice-versa, he takes all the <i>chullin</i> according to the proper amount of <i>terumat ma'aser</i> that is in the untithed produce. Whether the <i>ma'aser tevel</i> predominated over the <i>chullin</i>, or vice-versa, he takes all the <i>chullin</i> according to the proper amount of <i>terumat ma'aser</i> that represents the tithes of the untithed produce. [If he had] 180 untithed produce, he takes 92 less one tenth. [If he had] 100 [of untithed produce and desires to] take tithes, he takes 93 less two tenths from this, and the remainder according to his calculation.
One who separates a <i>log</i> of untithed food on behalf of 99, he says, "A log which is in the dregs (the bottom) of the flask, behold it is <i>chullin</i> and the remainder is terumah on everything."
Someone who had two barrels [of wine] -- one of impure <i>ma'aser tevel</i> (tithes separated from certainly untithed produce) and one of pure <i>ma'aser tevel</i> (see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai_7.8.3" href="Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.7.8.3">Y. Dem. VII.8.3</a>) -- [and he does not know which one is which], he brings two small vessels and fills from this one <i>terumat ma'aser</i> on behalf of both of [the barrels], and from that one the appropriate amount of <i>terumat ma'aser</i> on behalf of both of them. He then goes to the first [vessel], and says, "If this [wine] is from the impure [barrel], I have not said anything, but if this is from the pure [barrel], I am making [this vessel] <i>terumat ma'aser</i> on behalf of both of them."  He then goes to the second [vessel], and says, "If this is from the impure [barrel], I have not said anything, and if it is from the pure [barrel], I am making [this vessel] <i>terumat ma'aser</i> on behalf of both of them. " [In that way,] he has designated the first [as pure], and he has returned and designated the second [as pure], and as a consequence both barrels are [deemed to have been] tithed. One vessel [is deemed to consist] of  impure <i>ma'aser tevel</i>, and the other vessel of pure <i>ma'aser tevel</i>. [A Kohen may] drink from this one, and immerse himself [in a <i>mikveh</i>], and [then] drink from that one and immerse himself, and [then] drink from both of them at once, and he needs to immerse himself one last time.
Someone who had two barrels [of wine] -- one of impure (alt. "pure," per MS Erfurt) <i>ma'aser tevel</i> and one of pure unconsecrated [wine] -- he brings two small vessels and fills from this one the appropriate quantity of <i>terumat ma'aser</i> on behalf of that one, and from that one <i>terumat ma'aser</i> on behalf of this one.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">translation here follows see GR"A</i> He then goes to the first [vessel], and says, "If this one is impure, I have not said anything, and if this one is from the pure [barrel] I am making [this vessel] <i>terumat ma'aser</i> on the other [vessel]."  He then goes to the [second] vessel, and says, "If this is from the impure [barrel], I have not said anything, and if it is from the pure [barrel], I am making [this vessel] <i>terumat ma'aser</i> on the other [vessel]. " He designates the first, and he returns and and designated the second, and consequently both barrels [are deemed] tithed, and one vessel is of impure <i>ma'aser tevel</i>, and the other of pure unconsecrated [wine]. [A Kohen may] drink from this one and immerse himself, and [then] drink from the other one and immerse himself, and [then] drink from both of them at once, and he needs to immerse himself one last time.
