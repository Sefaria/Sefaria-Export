Tosefta Kelim Metzia



Chapter 1



3 Regarding a "klustra" (door bolt): Rabbi Tarfon declares it impure, but the Sages declare it pure. Beruriah says, "[One may] remove it from this doorway and hang it on the neighboring doorway on Shabbat." When these words were spoken before Rabbi Joshua, he said, "Beruriah has spoken well (i.e., correctly)."

Chapter 5

Vessels of dung and vessels of stone and oversized vessels of clay: Rabbi Meir says, behold, they are [treated] like [other vessels], but the Sages say, behold, they are [treated] like tents. Rabbi Nehemiah says, large baskets and large <i>sugin</i> (another type of basket) that have  rims and can hold 40 seahs of liquid, which are two kors of dry -- [behold, they are not impure, for] even though they are not moved [when they are full, they are moved when] there are remainders in them.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Note: the bracketed language follows the GR"A, as the Tosefta is defective at this point.</i> And how large are they? One cubit by one cubit by the height of three cubits, resulting in six hundred forty-eight handbreadths. The proof of the matter is [derived] from the dimensions of the Table (i.e., on which the showbread was placed). [On the topic of dimensions,] Rabbi Yosei says, regarding the "sea" that Solomon made, it says (2 Chron. 4:5, Koren tr.), "it held and contained three thousand <i>batim</i>." In another place it says (1 Kings 7:26), "it contained two thousand <i>batim</i>." It is impossible to say "two thousand" when it has already said "three thousand." And it is impossible to say "three thousand" when it has already said "two thousand." [Rather,] it was said, from now on, two thousand in wet is [equivalent to] three thousand in dry. § The tables that are [set next to] the dining couches [which] the homeowners eat upon -- even though they are as smooth as fingernails, they may contract impurity because they are like a slab, and it so happened with one homeowner who kept boards (נצרים, cf. Kel. 8:1 (נְסָרִים)) inside [his house], and they would ask him to send them to funeral meals and wedding feasts, and the matter came before the Sages, and they held them to be impure.

Chapter 6





Rabbi Meir says, all measurements that the Sages stated about a vineyard (see Kilayim 7:3), such as an empty patch in a vineyard, and the space between the vineyard and the fence, and the gaps in an <i>aris</i>, and the papyrus-ropes [of a trellis], all of them are [measured] with cubits of six handbreadths,<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">the translation "six handbreadths" follows the GR"A; the printed text, "five handbreadths," is inconsistent with the discussion that follows</i> except for the golden Altar, and the horns [of the Altar], and the surrounding [area], and the foundation, which are [measured] with a cubit of five handbreadths, as it is said (Ez. 43:13, JPS tr.), "And these are the dimensions of the Altar, in cubits where each is a cubit and a handbreadth]" -- that there were two measurements for the Altar. But perhaps all of them were [measured] with a cubit of five handbreadths? Thus the verse states, "With a cubits, each cubit [being] a cubit and a handbreadth," [meaning] with a cubit that is larger than its counterpart by a handbreadth.
