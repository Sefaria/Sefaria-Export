Tosefta Niddah



Chapter 1

How does 24 hours reduce examination to examination? She checks herself on sabbath and finds purity. And she passes the second and the third day and does not check. On the fourth she checks and finds impurity – see this is not impurity for 24 hours but from examination to examination. And how does examination to examination reduce 24 hours? She checks herself in the morning and find purity, and she passes a second and third hour and she does not check. And the fourth she checks and finds impurity – see this is not impurity from examination to examination, but for 24 hours. And so it says: 24 hours reduces examination to examination and examination to examination reduces 24 hours.
The hermaphrodite and androgynous, when they see their hour suffices. “The convert , when they see the first time – their hour is sufficient for them,” says R. Yehuda. R. Yosei says, “See she is like all (Jewish) women and are impure for 24 hours and from examination to examination.” What is from an accident? she becomes ill, and she sees, she jumped, and she sees, or her husband strikes her, and she sees, or she lifts something heavy, and she sees – this is an accident. And how is her hour sufficient? – When she sits on a bench, or a bed, or a seat, or a saddle, and is occupied with tohorot, or has intercourse with her husband, and gets up and sees – he is pure and the tohorot are pure.
Rabbi Eliezer said, “There are four women whose time is sufficient for them, the virgin, the pregnant woman, the nursing woman, and the menopausal woman.” Rabbi Yehoshua says, “I have only heard of the virgin.” Rabbi Eliezer said to him, “We do not say to the one who did not see the new moon to come and testify, but the one who sees. You have not heard, we have heard. You have heard one, we have heard four.” All the days of R. Eliezer the people’s custom was according to his words. After R. Eliezer died Rabbi Yehoshua returned to the words of their old age. And the halakha is according to R. Eliezer.
Who is [considered to be] a virgin [for purposes of <i>niddah</i>] (see Niddah 1:3)? Any girl who has not seen blood in her days, even if she is married and she has children, I call her a virgin, until her eyes have seen the first. Do not call her a virgin with respect to virginity, rather a virgin with respect to blood. Who is [considered to be] a "pregnant woman"? Summachos says in the name of Rabbi Meir, one whose status of being pregnant is known [to those around her] for three months, as it is said (Gen. 38:24): "And about three months had passed [after which it was told to Yehuda, Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the whore and indeed, behold, has become pregnant from whoring...]." [If] there was a presumption of pregnancy, and then she saw [blood], or she miscarried, [or] afterwards she [gave birth to] something that was not a child, it suffices [to reckon here impurity from] her set time (Eduyot 1:1, Kulp tr.). And even though there is no explicit proof about the matter, there is at least a hint (Is. 26:18), "Behold, we travailed as though we had given birth to the wind."
A girl whose time to see [a menstrual flow] had not yet come, and she saw a her first menstrual flow (lit., "saw her first seeing") and her second [menstrual flow], then by her third time she may impart impurity for a twenty-four hour period.  If she skipped two cycles (alt, שלש עונות ("three cycles"), see Ohr HaGanuz and Nidd. 9b:3) and then saw [a menstrual flow], her time is sufficient [to be subject to the laws of niddah]. Or if she arrived at her time to see [a menstrual flow] and she saw her first menstrual flow, and her second, she imparts impurity for twenty-four hours, and on the third [menstrual flow] her time is sufficient. if she skipped three cycles and then she saw [a menstrual flow], she imparts impurity for twenty-four hours. And from what point is she fit to see [a menstrual flow]? From the time that she grows two [pubic] hairs. Said Rabbi Eliezer, it so happened with a certain girl in Hitlo (Nidd. 9b:8, cf. Yeb. 59b:7), that when her time came to see [a menstrual flow] she skipped over three cycles [before once again resuming her flow], and the matter came before the Sages, and they said, her time is sufficient. They said to him, that was a provisional edict [issued under exigent circumstances, and thus cannot be applied to other case].
Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say, [with respect to] a pregnant woman and a nursing woman, their time is not sufficient, until three cycles pass, and the days of pregnancy combine with the the days of nursing. And elderly woman who stopped [seeing a menstrual flow] for three cycles and then saw it, her time is sufficient. [If] three cycles passed and then she saw it, behold, she is like any other woman and she imparts impurity for twenty-four hours, and from one examination to the next examination. This does not apply [when she saw a menstrual flow] at even intervals, but only if [the intervals] decreased or increased [to more or less than 90 days (see Nidd. 9b:7)] and then she skipped over three [cycles] and saw [blood] -- behold, she is like any other woman and she imparts impurity for twenty-four hours, and from one examination to the next examination, but if it to the contrary, it is not [considered to be a] menstrual cycle.
The four women as to whom [the Sages] said "their time is sufficient" (Nidd. 1:3), [if] they saw a stain and afterwards saw blood, their time is sufficient. If they skipped over three cycles, whether they saw it or they did not see it, and afterwards they saw it, their time is sufficient. [If] they skipped over three cycles within their days of purity and afterwards saw it, their time is sufficient.

Chapter 2

A nursing woman whose son dies -- within twenty-four months, she imparts impurity for twenty-four hours. Therefore, if she was nursing him and even five years pass, her time is sufficient, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say, her time is not sufficient; rather, twenty-four months. Therefore, if she was nursing and even four or five years pass, she only has twenty-four months. A nursing woman whose husband dies -- behold, she should not be betrothed or married until twenty-four months [of nursing] pass, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says, eighteen months. Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef says, Beit Shammai say, twenty-four months, and Beit Hillel say, eighteen months. Said Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel to the words of the one who says "twenty-four months," it is permitted for her to marry on the twenty-first month, [and] to the words of the one who says "eighteen months," it is permitted for her to marry on the fifteenth month, since milk does not spoil before three months have passed.
A child may go on nursing for twenty-four months, and from that time forward, he is like one who nurses from a non-kosher animal--these are the words of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Yehoshua says: a child may go on nursing even until he is a child of five years, but if he ceased and then returned (to nursing) after twenty-four months, behold he is like one who nurses from a non-kosher animal.
A woman is obligated to nurse her child for twenty-four months, whether her own or one who was given to her to wet-nurse. The woman given a child to wet-nurse should not do with him work and should not nurse another child with him. A child who recognizes his mother, they do not give him to nurse from someone else because of the danger to life. A child may nurse from an idol worshiper or from an unclean animal--he can nurse from anything, even on shabbat. But if he was an adult, it is prohibited. Abba Shaul says: we used to suckle from a clean animal on a holiday.
Three women may engage in relations using a [contraceptive] resorbant (see Ket. 39a:1, Steinsaltz tr.) -- a minor, a pregnant woman, and a nursing woman. A minor, lest she become pregnant and die. <i>What is a "minor"?</i> One who is from eleven years and one day old to twelve years old and one day. Less than that, or more [than that], she may engage in relations in her usual way, and there is no need to be concerned. A pregnant woman, lest her fetus becomes a sandal (i.e., it is flattened due to lack of space in her womb given the existing pregnancy, see Yeb. 100b:17). A nursing woman, lest she kill her son [by having her milk stop up]. And so too Rabbi Meir would say, one should not penetrate [his wife] inside and ejaculate outside, and the Sages say, he may engage in relations in his usual way, and from the Heavens they (i.e., the angels) stand guard over him, as it is said (Ps. 116:6), "God protects the simple ones."
A man may not marry a pregnant woman [who was impregnated] by his fellow, or a nursing woman [who is nursing the child] of his fellow, on account of that which is said (Prov. 23:10), "Do not remove ancient boundary stones; Do not encroach upon the field of orphans" (JPS tr.).
Every hand that checks [for menstrual blood] frequently -- in women, behold, it is praised, and in men it should be cut off. Rabbi Tarfon says, it should be cut off on his navel. Someone said to him, behold, would that not split open his belly? He said to them, that is precisely what I intend. He told a parable: To what is this matter comparable? To one who pus his finger in his eye -- every time he sticks it in, he causes tears to flow in abundance (i.e., a man checking a woman's genitalia will trigger an ejaculation). <i>In what case does this apply?</i> When there was a seminal emission, but, in the case of a <i>zava</i>, any hand that checks frequently (i.e., even that of a man), behold, it is praised.
An imbecile [who is a Kohen] -- they immerse him and they feed him Terumah in the evening. And they watch over him so that he does not fall asleep [and once again render himself impure through a seminal emission], and if he falls asleep he is rendered impure immediately upon awakening. Rabbi Eliezer bar Rabbi Tzadok says, "We make him a leather pouch [to cover his genitals] and we dress him with it and we check inside it [after he awakens], and if a seminal emission is found inside it, he is impure, and if not, he is pure." They said to him, "It turns out that that you have removed him from a status of doubtful [impurity], and have placed him into a status of certain [impurity], for [the pouch] will warm him up [and cause a seminal emission]." He said to them, "Not so. [And moreover,] according to your words, he is [always] impure." They said, "If a seminal emission is found, he is impure. And if not, he is pure. And we say, that if a drop [of semen] of any size emits from him, it will be absorbed in the pouch" (i.e., the proposed remedy is unreliable).
