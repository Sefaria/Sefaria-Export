Chapter 1

If a court issued [an erroneous] ruling and one of them knew that they erred or that one of them from the distinguished students who sit before them and are fit to issue rulings—like Shimon ben Azzai—[knew that the court erred] and he went and acted according [to their ruling], he is liable because he did not rely on the court.
If a court issued [an erroneous] ruling and the whole congregation or most of it acted according to [their ruling], in a time that its ruling is the ruling of the court, they are exempt and the ones who acted in accordance with it bring a bull. If the ruling is not a ruling of the court, they bring a bull and the ones who acted in reliance on it bring a female lamb or a she-goat. If a court issued [an erroneous] ruling and two or three of the tribes or the majority [of the members] of them acted in accordance with [the ruling], in a time when their ruling is the ruling of the court, they are exempt and the ones who acted in accordance [with the decision] bring a bull; [in a time when] their ruling is not the ruling of the court, they are liable and the ones who acted in accordance [with the ruling] bring a female lamb or a she-ass. If they made their decision themselves, they are exempt; the decision of the anointed priest, they are liable. If a court issued [an erroneous] decision and one of them was not there, they are exempt. Rabbi said, I say until the most distinguished of [the judges] is present. 
There is a stringency in erroneous rulings that there is not in capital cases, and [a stringency] in capital cases that there is not in erroneous rulings: [As to the former, a judge is not liable for] an erroneous ruling until all [the judges] issue the ruling as one (see Hor. 1:4), but in capital cases we follow the majority. [As to the latter, a judge is not liable for] an erroneous ruling unless the ruling is issued by the <i>beit din</i> presiding in the Chamber of Hewn Stone (i.e., the Sanhedrin), but in capital cases, [a judgment may be] issued in any place. An individual who issues (i.e., executes) an erroneous ruling by his own order, behold he is liable, as it is said (Num. 15:30), "But the person who acts high-handedly ... [shall be cut off from among his people]."
One who eats a <i>sheketz</i> (a detestable thing), he is an apostate. How so? An apostate [is one who] eats <i>neveilot</i> (carrion flesh) or <i>tereifot</i> (flesh of an animal with a mortal injury or defect), <i>sheketzim</i> or untithed produce, one who eats pig flesh or drinks wine of [an idolatrous] libation, or who desecrates the Sabbath (see Sanh. 8:2), or one who pours [wine of libation] (see Bava Kamma 117a:5). Rabbi Yosei son of Rabbi Yehudah says, even one who wears <i>kilayim</i> (i.e., garments of wool and linen). Rabbi Shimon son of Eliezer says, even one who does something that his inclination does not desire [i.e., even if the above acts were done without an evil intent].
[If] a <i>beit din</i> ruled at the conclusion of the Sabbath [that the sun had set, thus permitting labor], and then later the sun was seen shining [as may occur, e.g., on a cloudy day], this is not an erroneous ruling but merely a mistake (Yeb. 92a:2). [If] a <i>beit din</i> ruled to uproot an entire principle, [such as if] they said, "There is no blood (i.e., laws concerning the blood of a sacrificial animal) in the Torah," "There is no fat (i.e., laws concerning the fats of a sacrificial animal) in the Torah," "There is no <i>piggul</i> (Lev. 7:18) in the Torah," behold, they are exempt (Hor. 1:3). [If] they ruled to nullify part and uphold part, behold, they are liable. How so? [If] they said, "There is blood [in the Torah] but there is no obligation, except as to the blood of a peace offering." [Or if they said,] "There is fat in the Torah but there is no obligation except as to the blood of a peach offering." [Or if they said,] "There is <i>piggul</i> in the Torah but there is no obligation except as to <i>piggul</i> of a peace offering." Behold, [in these cases,] they are liable, as it is said elsewhere (Deut. 17:8, see below), "<i>matter</i>."  What does "matter" mean? As is said elsewhere (see Midrash Tehillim 105:1), of part of it, but not all of it. You say, a "matter" is part of it, but not all of it, or is it only all of it? The Torah teaches (Deut. 17:8), "[When any <i>matter</i> is too baffling for you, in justice,] between blood and blood," and not "all the blood" -- "between judgment and judgment," and not "every judgment" -- "between plague and plague," and not "every plague" -- thus, there is no need to say [in accordance] with the first version, but rather [in accordance] with the last version. [Just] as it says here, "<i>matter</i>," and it says elsewhere, "<i>matter</i>," what is "<i>matter</i>," so too it says elsewhere "part of it," but not "all of it." Rabbi Shimon ben Eliezer says in the name of Rabbi Meir, "If six sinned and they are the majority, or seven, even if they are not the majority, behold, they are liable."
If a court of one of the tribes issues [an erroneous] ruling and that same tribe acts in accordance with [the decision], the same tribe is liable and the rest of the tribes are exempt. Rabbi Yitzhaq son of Rabbi Yehuda says, the decision of the court with each and every tribe is like the decision of the court of the public, as the court and the anointed [priest] are liable only for absence [of awareness of] the matter with unwitting [performance] of the act or absence [of awareness of] the matter by the court and unwitting [performance of] the act by the congregation. If they act on their ruling for themselves, they are exempt. On the ruling of the anointed priest, they are liable. They are only liable for a matter whose intentional [violation renders one liable to receive] karet and [whose] unintentional [violation renders one liable to bring] a sin offering. And for the anointed priest, in cases of idol worship only with regard to a matter whose intentional [violation renders one liable to receive] karet and [whose] unintentional [violation renders one liable to bring] a sin offering. An anointed [priest] in a [ruling related] to idol worship is liable for the unwitting [performance] of the action according to Rabbi Meir but the Sages say, it is like the rest of the mitzvot where [one with] absence [of awareness of] the matter with unwitting [performance] of the act brings an asham talui.
[The court] is not liable [to bring a bull as an unwitting sin-offering for issuing a ruling regarding] a positive commandment or a negative commandment that [is related to the defiling of] the Temple, and one does not bring a provisional guilt-offering for a positive commandment or for a negative commandment [related to the defiling of] the Temple (Hor. 2:4). But [the court] is liable to bring a provisional guilt offering for a positive commandment or for a negative commandment regarding a <i>niddah</i>, said Rabbi Shimon. Why does liability that incurs [for a ruling regarding] a positive commandment involving a <i>niddah</i>? Because there is within it a negative commandment. Moreover, Rabbi Yehuda would say over a general rule regarding them: When an individual must bring a provisional guilt offering, the <i>nasi</i> (leader or prince) must do so as well, and the anointed [priest] and the court are exempt (Hor. 9a:10). [But when it comes to] a definite guilt offering, the <i>nasi</i> and the anointed [priest] are liable, and the court is exempt (<i>ibid.</i>).
For hearing a voice, and for an utterance of the lips, and for defiling the Temple or its consecrated [foods], the court is exempt, and the individual, the <i>nasi</i>, and the anointed [priest] are liable (Hor. 2:7, Hor. 9a:11). But the <i>nasi</i> is not liable for hearing a voice, and not for defiling the Temple or its consecrated [foods]. When it [requires] a variable rate sacrifice, the <i>nasi</i>, and similarly the anointed [priest] and the court are exempt. When it [requires] a fixed rate sacrifice, the individual and the <i>nasi</i> and the anointed [priest] bring a female lamb, and the court [brings] a bull and a female lamb as a burnt offering, and a male lamb as a sin offering (Hor. 2:6).

Chapter 2

These are the differences between the High Priest and a common priest: The bull that is offered for [the inadvertent transgression of] any commandment, and the bull brought on Yom Kippur, and the tenth of the ephah (Hor. 3:4). [The High Priest does not] grow his hair long [when in mourning] and [he] does not rend his garments [in the way that ordinary mourners do]. But [the High Priest] rends his garments from below [when in mourning], and the common priest [rends his garments] from above. [The High Priest] is not rendered impure by the death of his close relatives; and he is commanded to marry a virgin; and his is forbidden to marry a widow; and [his death permits] the return of the [accidental] killer [from a city of refuge], and he may sacrifice [when he is] an <i>onen</i> (a mourner on the first day of mourning, before the burial), but he may not eat from sacrifices or take a portion of them [on that day]; and he has the first [right] to sacrifice; and he takes his portion [of the sacrifice] first; and all the services performed on Yom Kippur are not valid unless [performed] by him; and he is exempt from [bringing an offering for inadvertently rendering] impure the Temple or the sacred utensils. And all of these (i.e., the aforementioned list) are conducted by a former [High Priests wearing] many vestments [and not only to High Priests who were anointed, who served during the First Temple period]; except as to the bull offered for [the inadvertent transgression of] any commandment, and none of them apply to an anointed [High Priest] for war, except for the five things that were explained, as written in the chapter [on the High Priest, Lev. 21:10-15]: he does not let his hair grow long [when in mourning]; he does not rend [his garments in the way that ordinary mourners do]; he is not rendered impure by the death of his close relatives; and he is commanded to marry a virgin; and his is forbidden to marry a widow; and [his death permits] the return of the [accidental] killer [from a city of refuge], the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, [his death does not permit] the return of the [accidental] killer.
Who is the <i>nasi</i> [that is obligated to bring an offering for sins committed before his appointment (Hor. 3:3, Hor. 10a:6)]?  [He is] the "<i>nasi</i>" (per Vienna Man.) of Israel (i.e., the king), not the "<i>nasi</i>" of a tribe (i.e., a tribal leader, cf. Num. 7:2). [In the event that there is both] a "<i>nasi</i> of Israel" and a "<i>nasi</i> of the House of David" -- this one brings [a sacrifice of] his own, and that one brings [a sacrifice of] his own.
Which is the anointed [priest]? The one anointed with the anointing oil. There is no difference between the one anointed with anointing oil [and the one consecrated by the donning] of many garments except that the one of many garments must bring a bull, according to Rabbi Meir, and the Sages say he does not bring a bull.
The bull of the anointed [priest] and the bull of the congregation (Hor. 3:6, Hor. 12b:20): the bull of the anointed [priest] precedes the bull of the congregation in all of its actions since the bull of the anointed [priest] atones and the congregation is atoned for. It is better for the one that atones to precede the one that is atoned for, as it says, “To make expiation for himself and for his household” (Lev 16:6). The bull that comes for every mitzvah precedes the bull and goat of idol worship and the bull and goal of idol worship precede the goat of the nasi and the goat of the nasi precedes the goat of the individual and the goat of the individual precedes the ewe of the individual. The two loaves precede the lambs. The omer precedes the lamb offered with it. This is the rule: The one that comes for the sake of the day comes before the one that comes for the sake of the bread. 
[If] he and his father and his teacher were taken as captive, he [should be released] before his teacher, and his teacher before his father, but his mother before any man. <i>Who is his "teacher"?</i> His teacher who taught him Torah, not his teacher who taught him a trade. <i>And which one is that?</i> The one who began and initiated with him [Torah study]. Rabbi Meir says, his teacher that taught him wisdom, not his teacher that taught him Torah. Rabbi Yehuda says, the one who taught him most of his instruction. Rabbi Yosei says, the one who opened his eyes to the Mishnah.
A man takes precedence over a woman [in regards to saving] a life and the return of lost property. A woman takes precedence over a man [in regards] to being clothed and to saving from captivity. In a situation that both of them are subjected to degradation, the man takes precedence. It so happened that Rabbi Yehoshua went to Rome. They told him, "There is here a certain child from Jerusalem, with beautiful eyes, and good-looking, who is about to be degraded." Rabbi Yehoshua went to check on him. When he arrived at the entrance [of where the captive was being held], he called out this passage (Is. 42:24): "Who was it who gave Jacob over to despoilment  and Israel to plunderers?" (JPS Tr.). The child answered him, and said (<i>ibid.</i>), "Surely, it is God, against whom we sinned." At that very moment, Rabbi Yehoshua said, "I call upon Heaven and earth to stand as witnesses before me, that I will not move from this place until I have redeemed him, no matter how much money it takes." [And indeed] he redeemed him with a great amount of money, and he went to live in the Land of Israel. And about him it is said (Lam. 4:2), "Children of Zion, O precious ones, whose value is as pure gold." [Note: Per Git. 58a:10, this child grew to become Rabbi Yishmael ben Elisha.]
The measure [allotted] to anyone that teaches a single chapter to his fellow, the verse ascribes to him as though he formed him, and shaped him, and brought him into this world, as it is said (Jer. 15:19), "If you bring out the precious (<i>yakar</i>) from what is worthless, you shall be as My spokesman (lit., 'My mouth')" (JPS Tr.). For just as the selfsame mouth [of God] imbued Adam the first man with a soul, so too [as to] anyone who brings a single creation under the wings of the <i>shekhinah</i>, we ascribe to him as though he formed him, and shaped him, and brought him into this world. And "precious" (<i>yakarah</i>) is Torah (lit., "teaching"), as it is said (Prov. 3:15), "She is more precious than rubies; [All of your goods cannot equal her]," and it says (Prov. 20:15), "Gold is plentiful, jewels abundant, But wise speech is a precious object" (JPS Tr.).
A Sage takes precedence over the King of Israel. [If] a Sage dies, we have no one like him, but if the King of Israel dies, all of Israel is fit for kingship. The King takes precedence over the High Priest, as it is said (I Kings 1:33), "And the King (i.e., King David) said to them (i.e., the Zadok the High Priest, among others), 'Take with you the servants of your lord (referring to himself), and have Solomon my son ride on my mule." The High Priest has precedence over a prophet, as it is said (I Kings 1:34), "And let Zadok the [High] Priest and Nathan the Prophet anoint him (i.e., Solomon) there" -- Zadok was mentioned before Nathan. And it says (Zech. 3:8), "Hear now, Yehoshua the High Priest, you and your fellows (i.e., fellow priests) that sit before you. [For these are men of portent (<i>mofet</i>), that I will bring forth a shoot from My servant]." Can these be ordinary men? Thus, the Torah states that "these are men of portent," and there is no "portent" but a prophet, as it is said (Deut. 13:2, referring to a prophet): "And if he gave to you a sign or a portent (<i>mofet</i>)."
[A High Priest] anointed with anointing oil takes precedence over [a High Priest] who wears many garments; [a High Priest] who wears many garments takes precedence over [a High Priest] anointed for war; [a High Priest] anointed for war takes precedence over a Deputy [High Priest]; a Deputy [High Priest] takes precedence over the head of the [priestly] watch; the head of the [priestly] watch takes precedence over the head of a patrilineal family; the head of a patrilineal family takes precedence over the overseer [of the Temple]; the overseer [of the Temple] takes precedence over the treasurer [of the Temple]; the treaturer [of the Temple] takes precedence over a common priest; a common priest takes precedence over a Levite; a Levite takes precedence over a [non-Levitical] Israelite; an Israelite [takes precedence over] a <i>mamzer</i>; a <i>mamzer</i> [takes precedence over] a <i>Natin</i> (i.e., a descendent of the Gibeonites, see Josh 9:27); a <i>Natin</i> [takes precedence over] a proselyte; a proselyte [takes precedence over] a freed slave. <i>When does this apply?</i> In a situation where all are [otherwise] equal. But if there was a <i>mamzer</i> who was a scholar, and a High Priest who was an <i>am ha'aretz</i> (i.e., an ignoramus), the <i>mamzer</i> who was a scholar would take precedence over the High Priest who was an <i>am ha'aretz</i>, as it is said (Prov. 3:15):  "She (i.e., wisdom) is more precious than rubies; All of your goods cannot equal her." Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, according to the letter of the law, a freed slave takes precedence over a proselyte because this one grew up in holiness, and that one did not [grow up in] holiness, except that this one was subject to a general curse (applicable to one who does not fulfill the entire Torah, see Sotah 37a:11), and that one was not subject to a general curse.
For what reason does everyone trip over themselves (lit., "jump") to get married to a female convert, but everyone does not trip over themselves to get married to a freed maidservant? Because the female convert is presumed to have guarded herself [and maintained her chastity], while a freed maidservant is presumed have been available. Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Tzadok says, because [the maidservant] is found to be cursed by all of humanity. For what reason does everyone inquire about [the conduct of a male] slave [before purchasing him]? Because he [is presumed to] deal badly with other people [since he cannot be held liable for damages (see Yerushalmi)].
"O House of Israel, bless the Lord, O House of Aaron, bless the Lord, O House of Levi, bless the Lord, Those who fear the Lord, bless the Lord" (Ps. 135:19-20). Consequently, Israel blesses one, the House of Aaron blesses two, the House of Levi blesses three, and those who fear the Lord bless four.
