Tosefta Shevuot



Chapter 1

If he had no knowledge at the beginning—whether there is knowledge at the beginning or knowledge at the end, the goats of the pilgrimage festivals and the goats of the new months atone according to Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon [say] that they distinguish between the goats when there is no knowledge either at beginning or end and the clean person who ate impure [food]. The goats of the pilgrimages and the goats of the new months atone, according to Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says, the goats of the pilgrimages atone but not the goats of the new months. Rabbi Shimon concurred about a goat that was not offered at a pilgrimage could be offered on a new month. If it is not offered on the new month, it should be offered on Yom Kippur. If it is not offered on Yom Kippur, it should be offered on the next pilgrimage, for from the beginning the public’s offerings are only consecrated on the condition that they be offered on the outer altar. Rabbi Shimon would say 32 goats are offered for the public every year. Thirty one outside, and they are eaten; one inside and it is not eaten, and the goat that is sent out. Twelve for the twelve months of the year. Seven for Pesach. Eight for Sukkot. Two for Yom Kippur. One for Rosh Hashanah. Two for Shavuot. One for the show-bread and one for the day. If the first atones, for what does the second atone? For uncleanness that happens between this one and that. And they thus said a Jew must bring two goats on each day but ha-kadosh barukh hu had pity on the Jews’ possessions.
Rabbi Shimon would say: Impurity of the Temple and its sacrificial foods is more serious than all the aveirot that are in the Torah, because all the aveirot that are in the Torah are atoned for by one goat but impurity of the Temple and its sacrificial foods is atoned for by 32 goats. All the aveirot that are in the Torah are atoned for once a year but impurity of the Temple and its sacrificial foods is atoned for every single month, as it says, “Assuredly, as I live—said the Lord God—because you defiled my sanctuary [with all of your detestable things and all of your abominations, I in turn will shear you away and show no pity” (Ezek 5:11). Serious were your detestable things and the abominations you did, but the impurity of the Temple and its sacrificial food is more serious than all of them.
A ma’aseh about two priestly brothers were running next to one another and they were going up the ramp. One of them preceded his fellow to the four amot. One of them took a knife and stabbed him in his heart. Rabbi Tzadoq came stood on the steps of the porch on the Temple Mount and said, “Hear me, my brothers, the house of Israel. Indeed it is said, ‘If someone is found slain in the land’ (Deut 21:1). And us, from where shall we measure? From the Sanctuary or from the courtyard?” All of Israel moaned in tears after his [words]. After that, the father of the boy came. He said to them, “I shall atone for you! My son is [still] convulsing, so the knife has not become impure.”  This teaches that the impurity of the knife was more serious to them than the shedding of blood. And so it says, “And also Manasseh spilled innocent blood” (II Kings 21:16). From here , they say, for the sin of bloodshed, the shekhinah was taken away and the Temple was rendered impure.
All of those who are unclean according to the Torah, whether they are made unclean by a minor source of impurity or a major one,  are liable for impurity [they impart to] the Temple and its sacrificial foods, as it says, “[When a person touches] any impure thing” (Lev 5:2), to include all the ones who are unclean according to the Torah. “Or anyone” (Lev 5:2)—why is this said? Since there are three mitzvot stated in the  verse, two explicitly and two implicitly, learn the implicit from the explicit. Just as the one mad explicit [requires] an oath, so too the unexplained [require] an oath. Even if he said to the witnesses, “Come and testify for me that I have not been made unclean,” and they said to him, “[By an] oath, [we swear] that we do not know any testimony on your behalf,” can they be liable? Scripture says, “or anyone,” to separate them from the rules of impurity and bring it into the rules of oaths. “Or anyone”—to include all people, even the prince and the anointed [priest]. Rabbi Yirmiya says, it is a matter one learns from its context. As it says, “But if one’s means to not suffice for a sheep” (Lev 5:7) and it says, “And if one’s means do not suffice for two [turtledoves or pigeons]” (Lev 5:11). Scripture speaks of one who has become poor, excluding the prince and the anointed [priest], who are not in the category of those who are poor, because their sanctification lasts forever. “Any impure thing” (Lev 5:2)—why does the Scripture say “thing”? Rabbi Aqiva says, to include the nega upon whom impurity does not settle. Rather in a matter that Rabbi Aqiva did not derive from a klal u’frat, he would derive via “inclusions and exclusions.” Thus did he learn from Nahum of Gam Zu. Rabbi Natan says, to include utensils upon which impurity does not settle, except by the intention [of the maker]. He said to him, Why are utensils seen [as impure] because of intention? For Rabbi Shimon would not derive from “inclusion and exclusion,” but he would derive from klal u’frat u’klal. “Or anyone touches any unclean thing”—a generalization (klal). “Or touches the corpse of an unclean beast”—a specification (prat). “Or when one touches human impurity” (Lev 5:3)—a generalization (klal). Klal u’frat u’klal, you do not decide except by the matter of the specification [which limits the rule]. When it says, “of whatever kind by which a person becomes impure” (Lev 5:3), it goes back and generalizes. If [one proposes] that [it is all included in] the first generalization, we say no. Rather it is a klal u'frat u'klal. You do not decide except by the matter of the specification. It says to you, as the specification is explicit about explicit kinds of impurity that are in Torah—excluding a herd of camels or a herd of sheep or a pack of wild animals or a resting bird, so impurity that is not explicit in the Torah [must be excluded]. Rabbi Natan says, impurity of glens and not impufity of consecrated things, excluding the one who burns the cow and the bulls and the one who sends out the goat, which are forms of impurity of consecrated things. I know only [that the rule applies to] clean domesticated species, wild animals, and birds. Unclean domesticated animals, wild animals, and birds, from where do I know this? Scripture says, “or the corpse of an unclean sheretz” (Lev 5:2). Rabbi Yoshiya said, Is there an unclean sheretz and a clean sheretz? Rather, just as it [does not] distinguish between an unclean sheretz and a clean one, thus between a domesticated animal and a wild animal, one should not distinguish between unclean and clean. I know only that [when I have] all of it [the animal]. [That it applies when I have only] an olive’s-bulk, from where do we learn it? Scripture says, “the corpse of an unclean wild animal” (Lev 5:2). Just as Scripture says impurity, it includes an olive’s bulk. Rabbi Shimon says, what was the reason they said that the domestic animal and the wild animal is impure [in the amount of] an olive’s-bulk, but of a sheretz [only] the bulk of a lentil? Rather, just as the domestic animal and the wild animal at the beginning of their creation are an olive’s-bulk, the sheretz is at the time of its creation a lentil’s bulk.
If he was unclean and the uncleanness left him but he remembered the Temple, or he forgot this one and that one, and he prostrated himself or stayed there for [enough time] to prostrate himself or he stayed with his fellow for [enough time] to prostrate himself or he entered the addition to the courtyard and stayed [long enough] to prostrate himself—he is liable for each and every one, according to Rabbi Yishmael . For Rabbi Yishmal says, “it was hidden from him” (Lev 5:2) and “it was hidden from him” (Lev 5:3), two times, to obligate him for forgetting the matter of impurity and for forgetting the Temple. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Aqiva say, he is only liable for forgetting the impurity.

Chapter 2

“By oath, I will not eat”—but he eats forbidden [foods], piggul, or unclean notar; “By oath, I will not drink”—but he drinks forbidden wine of orla or of a mixed vineyard, he is liable. But Rabbi Shimon exempts. “By oath, I will eat,” and he ate forbidden foods, piggul, or unclean notar; “By oath, I will drink,” and he drinks forbidden liquids, wine of orla or of a mixed vineyard, he is exempt. But Rabbi Shimon deems him liable. But Rabbi Shimon concedes when he says, “Qonam [another word for being forbidden] that my wife should benefit from me if I eat or drink,” and he ate prohibited food or drank prohibited drink, his wife is permitted to him.
“By oath, I will not eat,” but he goes back and says, “by oath, I shall eat,” [if he ate], for the latter he is immediately flogged. For the former, if he ate, he is liable, and if he did not, he is exempt. “By oath, I will eat,” and he goes back and says, “by oath, I will not eat,” for the latter he is immediately flogged. For the former, if he ate he is exempt and if he did not eat he is liable. “By oath, I will not eat… and I will not eat,” and he ate, he is not liable except once, for he only [made the later ones] to strengthen the first. “By oath, I will eat… I will eat...” but he did not eat, he is liable only one, as he said the latter only to strengthen the former. “By oath, I did not eat,” “By oath, I did not eat,” he is liable for each and every one. The [rule] is stricter [regarding something that has already] happened than what will come in the future.
The one who imposes an oath on an idolator, or on women, or on minors, or on relatives, or on those invalid [to testify], they are exempt, as it says, “Though he was a witness” (Lev 5:1). [It speaks] of a witness that is suitable to extract money [from a defendant]. Rabbi Eliezer says, the one who imposes an oath on a single witness is exempt, as he is not suitable to extract money. Testimony about money is established on what one has seen but not known or what one has known but not seen. What [is a case] where one has seen but does not have knowledge? “Give me two hundred zuz which are in your hand!” “You have no money in my hand.” “Didn’t I count for you in the presence of so-and-so and so-and-so?” “They should say, and I will give you!” This is seeing without having knowledge. And what is having knowledge without seeing? “Give me two hundred zuz that are in your hand!” “You don’t have two hundred zuz in my hand.” “Didn’t ou admit to me in the presence of so-and-so and so-and-so?” “Let them say, and I will pay you.” This is knowledge without seeing.
They are liable for deliberate testimony with a deliberate oath, and for a deliberate testimony with an inadvertent oath, and for inadvertent testimony he is exempt. And what is deliberate testimony with a deliberate oath for which he is liable? If he knew testimony for someone and he knew that whoever makes a [false] oath brings a sacrifice, this is deliberate testimony with a deliberate oath for which he is liable. And what is deliberate testimony with an inadvertent oath for which he is liable? If he knew testimony for him but did not know that one who makes a [false] oath brings a sacrifice, this is deliberate testimony with an inadvertent oath for which he is liable. And which is inadvertent testimony for which he is exempt? He did not know any testimony for him or he knew and forgot it at the moment he took the oath, he is exempt, as it says, “And he took an oath falsely” (Lev 5:1).
They are liable for deliberately [denying] a deposit and deliberately taking an oath, and for deliberately [denying] a deposit with an inadvertent oath, but for inadvertently [denying] a deposit, he is exempt. Which is the case of deliberately [denying] a deposit with a deliberate oath for which he is liable? If he knew that he had a deposit in his possession and he knew that anyone who makes a [false] oath [in this situation]  brings a sacrifice, this is a deliberate [denying] a deposit and deliberately [taking a false] oath, for which he is liable. Which is deliberately [denying] a deposit and inadvertently [taking a false] oath, for which he is liable? If he knew that he had a deposit in his possession but he did not know that one who takes a [false] oath [in this situation] brings a sacrifice, this is deliberately [denying] a deposit and inadvertently [taking a false] oath, for which he is liable. Which is inadvertently [denying] a deposit, for which he is exempt? If he didn’t know that he had a deposit in his possession or if he knew but then forgot in the moment that he took the oath, he is exempt, as it says, “And he took an oath falsely” (Lev 5:1). If he went after witnesses and they said, “Why are you coming after us? By oath, we know no testimony for you,” they are exempt until he makes a claim against them. But [in the case of] a bailment, it is not like that. “Why are you coming after me? By oath, I have nothing of yours in my possession,” he is exempt [liable?]. The rule of an oath relating to a bailment is stricter than the rule of an oath about testimony. If he said to the witnesses, “Come and testify for me that I have in so-and-so’s possession 200 zuz, the wage of a hired man or money for my wife and daughters.” “By oath, we will not testify for you,” these are exempt until they say, “By oath, we do not know any testimony on your behalf.” And thus regarding bailment: If he said to him, “Give me two hundred zuz that I have in your possession from the business of a hired man’s wages or the money for my wife and daughters.” “By oath, I will not give to you,” he is exempt until he says to him, “By oath, I have nothing of yours in my possession.” If he said to the witnesses, “Come and testify for me that so-and-so said to give to me two hundred zuz and he didn’t give it to me” [or] “a garment that he said he would clothe me [with] and he did not clothe me.” “By oath, we do not know any testimony for you,” these are exempt as he might say to him, “He told me to give to you but it is not possible to give to you.” Or, “he said he would clothe you but it is not possible to clothe you.” And thus for a bailment: If he said, “He said [he would] give two hundred zuz but he did not give it to me,” [or] “a garment that he said he would [use] to clothe me, and he did not clothe me.” “By oath, I have nothing of yours in my possession,” he is exempt, for he could say to him, “I said I would give to you but it is not possible to give to you.” Or “I said I would clothe you but it is not possible to clothe you.”
The one who takes an oath before an idolator or before brigands or before tax-collectors is exempt, as it says, “if he incurs guilt.” If he did not tell, he is a sinner if he did not tell, do not let him be a sinner when he told. “Come and testify for my father that he has in so-and-so’s possession two hundred zuz from the business of a hired man’s wages or money for my wife or daughters.” “By oath, we know no testimony for you,” they are exempt until they hear [the oath] from the plaintiff’s mouth. If his father died, his sons inherited and entered into his place, then [the son] is like [the father for the purposes of administering an oath].
The one who says, “May God strike you,” “May he do good for you thus,” “May he do good for you,” “May he do evil for you,” May God do evil to you thus,” “May he do this evil to you,” these are statements in the Torah. Rabbi Yehuda says, “may he do good,” is exempt, but the Sages deem liable in the case of one who says, “May he do good for you if you come and give testimony for me,” “May he do evil to you if you come and give testimony for me,” “May he not do evil to you if you come and give testimony for me.”
“You have seduced and raped my daughter.” And he says, “I did not seduce and I did not rape,” “I impose an oath you,” and he says, “Amen,” he is liable. Rabbi Shimon exempts for he does not pay a fine on his own testimony. This is the rule: In all cases where there is a fine and he would pay on the basis of his own testimony, “I impose an oath on you,” and he says, “Amen,” he is exempt.  And in all cases without a fine and in which he would not pay on his own testimony, “I impose an oath on you,” and he says, “Amen,” he is liable. The one who says, “I swear by the Torah and by Heaven,” is exempt.

Chapter 3





Channanya ben Chakhinai said, "<i>And denies against his neighbor</i> (Leviticus 5:21): A person does not deny his neighbor until he denies an Essential Principle." Once Rabbi Reuven was in Tiberius on Shabbat. He was found [there] by a philosopher. He said to him, "Who is the most hated one in the world?" He said to him, "One who denies the One who created him. Who is that one? [The one that God] said to him, <i>Honor your father and your mother[...] Do not commit murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not testify[...] Do not covet</i> (Exodus 20:12-14). A person does not deny his neighbor until he denies a Major Principle, and a person does not go to a matter of sin unless he has denied the One who commanded him about it." <i>The voice of an alah</i> (Leviticus 5:1): Rabbi Yehudah says, "An <i>alah</i> is a curse. <i>The voice</i> [is an] oath." Rabbi Shimon says, "An <i>alah</i> is an oath. These are [oaths] with appellations [of God]: I am the One who binds you, I am the One who shackles you, by the Righteous, by the Pure, by the Just. [If one makes an oath with these,] he is liable." <i>And he were a witness</i> (Leviticus 5:1): <i>And he were a witness</i>, and not a witness who [only] heard from a witness, and not from a heavenly voice, and not from an echo. <i>And he were a witness</i>, Scripture is speaking about [a case of] two witnesses; or is it only one witness? Hence we learn to say, <i>One witness may not arise against a man</i> (Deuteronomy 19:15). Hence we should not learn to say one [witness]. Rather, every place where Scripture took the expression, witness, by itself, behold it includes two unless Scripture specifies one to you.
