Chapter 3



Chapter 4







Rabbi Shimon says, in the general principles of creation, the heavens were created before the earth in one place, as it is written: "On the day that the Lord God made earth and heaven" (Genesis 2:4). This teaches that they are considered equal. In every place, Abraham preceded the patriarchs in one place, as it is written: "And I will remember My covenant with Jacob" (Leviticus 26:42), which teaches that the three are considered equal. In every place, Moses preceded Aaron in one place, as it is written: "These are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar" (Exodus 6:23), which teaches that they are considered equal. In every place, Joshua preceded Caleb in one place, as it is written: "Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh" (Numbers 13:6) and "Joshua the son of Nun" (Numbers 13:8), which teaches that they are considered equal.
