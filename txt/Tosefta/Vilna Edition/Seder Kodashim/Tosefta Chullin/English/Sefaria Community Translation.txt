Chapter 1

Everyone is fit to slaughter, even a Samaritan, even an uncircumcised Israelite, and even an Israelite who changes his belief to idolatry (lit., "star-worship"). The slaughter by an idolater, behold, that is invalid, and the slaughter by a monkey, behold, that is invalid, as it is said, "And <i>you</i> shall slaughter…and <i>you</i> shall eat” (Deut. 27:7). Not that "the idolater shall slaughter," and not that "the monkey shall slaughter," and not that the slaughter shall be accidental. An Israelite that [commenced the] slaughter, and an idolater [who was] next to him finished the slaughter, the slaughter is invalid. If he slaughtered two [<i>simanim</i> (the gullet and the windpipe)], or the majority of two, his slaughter is valid. An idolater that [commenced the] slaughter, and an Israelite [who was] next to him finished the slaughter, the slaughter is valid. If [the idolater commenced the] slaughter with something that does not render [the slaughter] a tereifa<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., a mortal injuries or physical defect disqualifying an animal from consumption (see Hul. 3:1)</i>, and the Israelite came and finished, it is permitted to eat. An Israelite and an idolater that were holding the knife, and they slaughter -- even [if] one was on top and one was on the bottom (Hul. 2:2) --  their slaughter is valid.
And similarly as to a blind person that knows how to slaughter, his slaughter is valid (Hul. 1:1). A minor that knows how to slaughter, his slaughter is valid (<i>ibid.</i>). § They (i.e., those who are permitted to slaughter) can always slaughter, whether during daytime or nighttime, whether on a boat or on top of a roof. They can slaughter with anything (Hul. 1:2), even with a flint, even with glass, even with the point of a reed. They can slaughter with anything, whether with something connected to the ground, or whether disconnected from the ground; whether the knife is passed on top of the throat, or whether the throat is passed on top of the knife and slaughtered, [and] his slaughter is valid.
One who flays the skin of an animal [by pulling it from the feet toward the neck (see Jastrow, "מרגל")] and [then] slaughtered [the animal], his slaughter is valid. A detached tooth or a detached fingernail -- they may slaughter with it (Hul. 1:2). A scythe [may only be used to slaughter] by [cutting] in the direction it normally traverses (alt., moving it forward) (<i>ibid</i>). Beit Shammai invalidate it and Beit Hillel validate it. And if the teeth of the scythe are filed away, behold, it is like a [regular] knife. One who [intended to] stick a knife in the earth by throwing it<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>באַטְלֵק</b> not <b>באטלס</b> (see Jastrow)</i> and slaughtered with it, his slaughter is invalid. A knife that has many notches (lit., "notches notches"), behold, that is like a saw. If there is between one notch and the next notch [a space equivalent to the space] between the two [<i>simanim</i>] in the neck, his slaughter is valid. [If] there is but a single notch, if it would get caught, the slaughter is [nonetheless] valid, [but] if it strangles, it is invalid.
[If] he threw the knife or the dagger [intending to slaughter,] and slaughtered, his slaughter is valid. In the name of Rabbi Nathan they said, [if the slaughter in this fashion occurs] in the direction that [the knife or dagger] normally traverses, it is valid, but if it is against the grain, it is invalid.
The commandment of ritual slaughter [is performed] by drawing [the knife] back and forth. [If] one drew it forward but not back, or drew it back but not forward, it is valid, as long as the knife is [long] enough to draw forward and back. [If] he draws it forward and back, even if the knife is not [long] enough to cover the two [<i>simanim</i>] of the neck, his slaughter is valid.
The commandment of ritual slaughter [is performed by cutting] from the [uppermost tracheal] ring and until the lung. [Cutting in a] slanting [motion] is invalid. Rabbi Chananiah ben Antigonos renders it valid. [If the cut] left a thread's-breadth adjacent to the top [of the ring] and circled around the whole [ring], it is valid. Rabbi Yosei son of Rabbi Yehuda says, if the [thread's-breadth] circled around the major part [of the ring], [giving the cut an appearance] like the moon, it is valid. And the whole neck is valid for slaughter.
One who slaughters from above, his slaughtering is valid. From below or from the sides [of the throat], his slaughtering is invalid (cf. Hul. 1:4, validating the latter). And from the nape of the neck is valid for melikah (pinching off the neck of a sacrificial bird offering). One who performs melikah from above, his melikah is valid. From below or from the sides, his melikah is invalid. Slaughtering [is performed] with a utensil, and melikah with the hand, and consequently it is said (Hul. 1:4), "[What is] valid for slaughter is invalid for melikah, [and what is] valid for melikah is invalid for slaughter." [Moreover,] the slaughter of a fowl inside [the Temple (see Zev. 85a:3)] is invalid, and the melikah is valid, [while]  the melikah of a fowl outside [the Temple] is invalid and the slaughter is valid, and consequently it is said, "A valid location for slaughter is invalid for melikah, and a valid location for melikah is invalid for slaughter."
The blood of an animal sin offering is placed above [the altar's mid-line], and the blood of all [other] offerings is placed below (cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Mishnah_Kinnim.1.1" href="Mishnah_Kinnim.1.1">Kinnim 1:1</a>), and consequently it is said, "[What is] valid in a sin offering is invalid in all [other] offerings, [and what is valid] in all [other offerings] is invalid in a sin offering. [What is] valid in the external altar is invalid in the inner altar, [and what is] valid in the inner alter is invalid in the external altar. [What is] valid in rams is invalid in lambs, [and what is] valid in lambs is invalid in rams." But one that is a <i>palges</i> (a lamb or ram in its 13th month, see Par. 1:3), in this one or in that one, is invalid.
[What is] valid for the red heifer is invalid for the heifer whose neck is broken (Deut. 21:1-4), and what is valid for the heifer whose neck is broken is invalid for the red heifer (Hul. 1:6). And work [in the field] renders each of them unfit. B'nei yonah (young pigeons), once they are old enough to sip (see Hul. 22b:6), until their feathers become golden [are fit for sacrifice], [while] turtledoves, once they are able to fly, even if they are old [are fit for sacrifice], and consequently it is said, what is valid in turtledoves is invalid in b'nei yonah, and what is valid in b'nei yonah is invalid in turtledoves.
Kohanim that reach puberty, and even when they grow old, are fit [to perform the Temple service], but a blemish renders them unfit. Levites from 30 to 50 years old are fit [to perform their duties], but a blemish does not render them unfit, and consequently it is said (Hul. 1:6), "[What is] fit for a Kohen is unfit for a Levite, [and what is] fit for a Levite is unfit for a Kohen." <i>In what case does this apply?</i> In the Tent of Meeting in the desert, but in the eternal House (i.e., the Temple), the Levites are only rendered unfit as to their voice (i.e., participating in the Levitical chorus). [What is] fit in the Kohen Gadol is unfit for an ordinary Kohen, [and what is] fit for an ordinary Kohen is unfit for a Kohen Gadol. [What is] valid in the golden vestments is invalid in the white vestments, [and what is] valid in the white vestments is invalid in the golden vestments (see Yoma 7:4).
A menorah is not valid unless it is produced a solid block [of gold (see Menachot 28b:4)]. [If it is fashioned from] filings, it is invalid, and if it is made from other types of metal, it is valid. Trumpets are not valid unless they are fashioned from silver. [If] they are fashioned from [silver] filings, they are valid. [If] from other types of metal, they are invalid, and consequently it is said, "[What is] invalid in a menorah is valid in trumpets, [and what is] invalid in trumpets is valid in a menorah."
The airspace above an earthenware vessel is impure and its outer side is pure, [while] the airspace above all [other] vessels is pure and their outer side is impure (Hul. 24b:11), and consequently it is said (Hul. 1:6), "What is pure in an earthenware vessel is impure in all [other] vessels, and what is impure [Vienna Man., "pure"] in all [other] vessels is pure [Vienna Man., "impure"] in an earthenware vessel." Flat wooden vessels are pure, and unformed [wooden vessels] are impure, [while] flat metal vessels are impure, and unformed [metal vessels] are pure, and consequently it is said (Hul. 1:6), "[What is] pure in a wooden vessel is impure in a metal vessel, [and what is] pure in a metal vessel is impure in a wood vessel." And one who brings chests and ovens, basins, and earthenware [vessels] from outside the Land [of Israel]: Before they are fired, [vessels are deemed] impure because they were [produced in] the lands of the [Gentile] nations, except that [they are deemed] pure if they are earthenware vessels, [but] once they have been fired, [vessels are deemed] impure if they are earthenware vessels, and [all other vessels are deemed] pure because they were [produced in] the lands of the [Gentile] nations, and consequently it is said, "Whenever [vessels are deemed] impure by virtue of [being produced in] the lands of the [Gentile] nations, [they are deemed ] pure by virtue of being earthenware vessels, and whenever [vessels are deemed] impure by virtue of being earthenware vessels, they are [deemed] pure by virtue of [being produced in] the lands of the [Gentile] nations." Olives are impure when dry and pure when wet<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">following MS Vienna; but see Toh. 9:1</i>, [but olive] pits are impure when wet and pure when dry, and consequently it is said, "[What is] pure when dry is impure when wet, [and what is] pure when wet is impure when dry." Bitter almonds: The small ones are liable [for tithing], and the large ones are exempt. And sweet [almonds]: The large ones are liable and the small ones are exempt, and consequently it is said (Hul. 1:6), "[What is] liable in bitter almonds is exempt in sweet [almonds], [and what is] liable in sweet [almonds] is exempt in bitter [almonds]. "
[What is] valid in a get (a bill of divorce) is invalid in a prozbul<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">a document permitting debt collection after the sabbatical year (see Shev. 10:3)</i>, [and what is] valid in a prozbul is invalid in a get (see Ket. 9:9). [What is] valid in [other] women is invalid in a yevama<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">a childless widow who is only permitted to her deceased husband's brother</i> and [what is] valid in a yevama is invalid in [other] women. [What is] valid in a divorced woman is invalid in a chalutzah<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">a yevama whose brother-in-law does not marry her, resulting in the ritual of chalitza</i>, and what is valid in a chalutzah is invalid in a divorced woman. (See Hul. 1:7.)
Whenever there is the blowing of the shofar, there is no havdalah, and whenever there is havdalah there is no blowing of the shofar. [If] a Festival falls on the day before Shabbat, the shofar is blown, but there is no havdalah. [If a festival] falls on the day following Shabbat there is havdalah but the shofar is not blown. How is it blown? It is a single sound, and not multiple sounds.

Chapter 2

One who slaughters [by cutting] two halves [of the <i>simanim</i>] of a bird, his slaughter is invalid (Hul. 2:1), and needless to say, [cutting] two halves of [the <i>simanim</i>] of an animal [is invalid].  Rabbi Yehuda invalidates any [slaughter] unless [the animal] is slaughtered [by cutting] the gullet and the two veins (i.e., the two major blood vessels in the neck). If he slaughtered half of the windpipe of a fowl and waited according to [the amount of time to perform a complete] slaughter, and afterwards completed the slaughter, his slaughter is valid. [If a slaughter involved the cutting of] one <i>siman</i> or the majority of one in a fowl, even though the it an extended period of time, the slaughter is valid. [If] there as a butcher who cut off the head in one swing, if he intended that [outcome], his slaughter is invalid, but if he did not intend it, his slaughter is valid. If the windpipe was severed and afterwards he slaughtered the gullet, his slaughter is invalid. If he slaughtered the gullet, and found the windpipe [already] severed, there is a doubt [whether the windpipe became severed] before he began the act of slaughter, and a doubt [whether it occurred] once the slaughter had begun. There was once such a situation, and they came and asked the Sages, and they said, "Every doubt involving a severed [organ renders the slaughter] invalid."
[If] someone's chicken was stolen, and he came and found it slaughtered, [or] if his livestock was stolen, and he came and found it slaughtered, Rabbi Chananiah, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGalili invalidates it and Rabbi Yehuda validates it. Said Rebbi, the words of Chananiah son of Rabbi Yosei HaGalili are preferable as to one who finds it inside a house, and the words of Rabbi Yehuda [are preferable] as to one who finds it in a trash heap. As to one who finds a chicken slaughtered in the market, and similarly who gave a chicken to someone from the market to slaughter, and does not know what his practice is, we follow after the majority. If a knife fell and he slaughtered, or if he pressed down and slaughtered it (Hul. 30a:15), or if he slaughtered it from above, it is [considered] carrion and it imparts impurity by carrying. [If] he was slaughtering and he trembled, or became exhausted, or his friend pushed him, or the wind pushed him, or the knife fell from his hand and he picked it back up, or the corner of his cloak fell and he picked it back up, or he waited the amount of time [it would take to perform] another slaughter, [the slaughter] is invalid (Hul. 2:3). Rabbi Shimon says, [if the delay was] as long as [it would take to slaughter] another livestock. [If] he slaughtered the gullet and waited as long as [it would take to perform] a slaughter, and afterwards he severed the gullet [not in a standard manner (see Hul. 32a:17)], or he sharpened the knife under the gullet, and it was severed, or he sharpened the knife under the windpipe and it was severed, or he sharpened the knife under both of them, and both of them were severed, Rabbi Yeshevav says, it is [considered] carrion (Hul. 2:4) and it imparts impurity by carrying. Rabbi Akiva says, it is [considered merely] a tereifah, and its slaughter is ritually pure. Rabbi Yeshevav said to him, "If you remember, that Rabbi Yehoshua would teach (i.e., repeat the oral tradition) that anything that becomes unfit during the act of slaughter is [considered] carrion, and imparts impurity by carrying, [but anything that is rendered unfit] before the act of slaughter is a tereifah, and the slaughter renders it ritually pure." Rabbi Akiva [then] retracted [his ruling] and began teaching in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Yeshevav. [If] he slaughtered a small part of the gullet and waited as long as [it would take to perform another] slaughter, and afterwards he [completed] slaughtering both [<i>simanim</i>], or if the gullet was punctured and afterwards he slaughtered both [<i>simanim</i>], [the slaughter is considered] a tereifah and the slaughter renders it ritually pure.
Rabbi Shimon says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, one who slaughters at night, and at daybreak he came and found walls full of blood, [the slaughter is] valid (Hul. 2:6) since he knows that [the blood] spurted. Rabbi Yosei says, Rabbi Meir would say, if it lowed at the time of slaughter, it is valid (Hul. 38a:5). Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei says in his name, [if he slaughters an animal whose] eyes are trembling, or if he finds excrement at the time of slaughter, [the slaughter is] valid. If it straightened its foreleg and did not bring it back, it is invalid, as there is nothing but [evidence of] the expiring of a life. And [as to] the hindleg, [if the animal] straightens the leg and does not bring it back, or brings the leg back but does not straighten it, the slaughter is valid (see Hul. 2:6, Hul. 38a:3). <i>To what case does this rule apply?</i> To a small animal, but as to a large animal, whether the foreleg or the hindleg, [whether] it straightens but does not bring it back or brings it back but does not straighten, [the slaughter] is valid. <i>To what case does this rule apply?</i> To livestock but as to fowl, even if it only twitched the top of its wing or the top of its tail, [the slaughter is] valid.
One who slaughters livestock in order to  to throw the blood for [purpose of] idol worship, or to use its fat as a burnt offering for idol worship, behold, this is [considered to be like] the meat of the sacrifices of the dead (Ps. 106:28). If once it was slaughtered he threw its blood for idol worship, or used its fat as a burnt offering for idol worship, this is what happened in Caesarea, and they came and asked the Sages, and they did not say whether [the meat from the sacrifice] was forbidden or permitted. One who slaughters in the [Temple] courtyard impure livestock, undomesticated animals, or fowl -- they are forbidden to derive benefit from, and needless to say for consumption. Ritually pure livestock, undomesticated animals, and fowl [slaughtered in the Temple courtyard] are permitted to derive benefit from. One who slaughters a tereifa, Rabbi Meir forbids deriving benefit and Rabbi Shimon permits deriving benefit. One who slaughters for [purposes of] healing, to feed idol worshippers, or to feed dogs, it is forbidden to derive benefit. One who slaughters but renders [the animal] carrion by his own actions, and one who [kills the animal by] stabbing, or by tearing loose [the windpipe], [if such] a slaughter is for idol worshippers it is permitted to derive benefit (see Hul. 2:6). One who slaughters ritually pure livestock, undomesticated animals, or fowl in the women's courtyard [of the Temple] , it is permitted to eat, and needless to say, to derive benefit.
Rabbi Meir says, [regarding the verse,] "It is better not to vow, than to vow and not fulfill" (Ecc. 5:4), it is better than both of these that one not take a vow at all (Ned. 9a:7). Rabbi Yehuda says, it is better not to vow [than to vow and not fulfill], but is it not better than both of these to bring his lamb to the [Temple] courtyard and lean on it and slaughter it?
One who slaughters in the name of the sun, the name of the moon, the name of the stars, the name of the [zodiacal] constellations, for the sake of Michael, minister of the great army, or for the sake of a small worm, behold, [in all those cases] this is [considered like] the meat of offerings to the dead, [from which benefit is forbidden (see Hullin 40a:2)]. One may not slaughter [so that the blood runs] either into the seas, or into the rivers (Hullin 2:9), or into murky water, but he may slaughter [so that the blood flows] into a goblet of water, or on a ship [he may let it flow] into a vessel, and if there is no place on the ship he can slaughter into the sea, and if he does not want to sully his house, he may slaughter inside a a vessel or inside a hole (ibid.). But in the market he should not do so because this is what is done by those who worship the stars. If he does this, he should be checked [to ensure he does not harbor heretical beliefs].  Meat that is found in the hand of a star-worshipper is permitted to benefit from; in the hand of a [Jewish] heretic it is forbidden to benefit from; from the house of a heretic, behold, it is [considered to be like] the meat of the sacrifices of the dead (Ps. 106:28), as it is said, "The slaughter of the heretic [is tantamount to slaughter] for the sake of star-worship (i.e., idolatry), and their bread is the bread of star-worshippers, and their wine is the wine of libation [of star-worshippers], and their produce is [all considered] untithed (see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Tractate_Kutim.1.7" href="Tractate_Kutim.1.7">Kutim 1:7</a>), and their books are the books of sorcery, and their children are [considered to be] mamzers, and we do not sell to them, and we do not buy from them, and we do not marry their daughters (lit, "marry from them"), and we do not give [our daughters] to them, [and] we do not teach their children an occupation, and we do not [accept] treatment from them, either monetary treatment or medical treatment" (cf. Ab. Zar. 2:2).<br>It so happened with Rabbi Eliezer ben Dama, the son of Rabbi Yishmael's sister, that a snake bit him, and along came Ya'akov, a man from K'far Sachnai, to heal him (MS Vienna adds, "in the name of Yeshua ben Panteira"), and Rabbi Yishmael did not allow it. He said to him, "You are not allowed, ben Dama!" He said to him, "I will bring you proof that he can heal me," but he did not have enough time to bring him proof before he died. Rabbi Yishmael said, "Ben Dama is fortunate that he departed to eternal peace, and did not tear down the fences of the Sages, before [divine] retribution came upon him," as it is said (Ecc. 10:8), "He who tears down a fence will be bitten by a snake."<br>It so happened with Rabbi Eliezer that he was apprehended over words of heresy, and they brought him before the court to render judgment. The <i>hegemon</i> said to him, "Is an old man like you [really] occupied in such matters?" [Rabbi Eliezer] said to him, "The Judge is trusted by me." The <i>hegemon</i> thought that Rabbi Eliezer was talking about no one else but him, although Rabbi Eliezer did not intend [to refer to anyone] but his Father in heaven. The <i>hegemon</i> said to him, "Since you trusted only in me, thus I say: It is possible that these grey hairs may have erred in such matters. [Thus, you are] acquitted; you are exempt." And at the time that he was freed from the court, he was sorry that he had been arrested on the words of the heretics, and his students came to him to console him, and he did not accept [their consolation]. [Thereafter,] Rabbi Akiva entered [Rabbi Eliezer's house] and said to him, "Rabbi, may I speak before you to ease your distress?" He said to him, "Speak." He said to him, "Perhaps one of the heretics said to you a word of heresy (i.e., one of his teachings) that pleased you." He said to him, "Yes." He said to him, "By the heavens, you reminded me! One time I was walking in the camp of Sepphoris, when I met a man of K'far Sachnai, and he said a word of heresy (MS Vienna adds, "in the name of Yeshua ben Panteira"), and I enjoyed it, and thus I was apprehended on the words of heresy, such that I transgressed the words of Torah, "Remove your way from her, and do not  approach the entrance of her house" (Prov. 5:8), "for she has cast down many wounded" (Prov. 7:26). And thus Rabbi Eliezer says, "A man should always flee from ugliness, and from anything that resembles ugliness" (Avot DeRabbi Natan 2:2).
One who slaughters [outside the Temple] for the sake of a burnt offering, for the sake of a peace offering, for the sake of a provisional guilt offering, for the sake of a Passover offering, for the sake of a thanksgiving offering, his slaughter is invalid (Hul. 2:10). Rabbi Shimon deems it valid, since none of these are offered voluntarily. Rabbi Shimon says, a slaughter [outside the temple] for the sake of a burnt offering, behold, it is not a burnt offering. Rabbi Shimon said, what if he said, "Behold, it is incumbent on me to bring a burnt offering that I will offer on the other side of the Jordan" -- perhaps it is a [valid] burnt offering? Therefore, one who slaughters [outside the Temple] for the sake of a burnt offering, behold, that is not a burnt offering, [and] one who slaughters for the sake of a sin offering, for the sake of a definite guilt offering, for the sake of a bekhor (i.e., a first-born male animal), or for the sake of tithes but not terumah, his slaughter is valid. This is the general rule: Something that is [slaughtered as a result] of a vow or a gift, the slaughter for its sake is invalid, and something that is [slaughtered] not due to a vow or a gift [but rather due to an obligation], the slaughter for its sake is valid.

Chapter 3

And these are the tereifot<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">"mortal injuries or defects," lit. "torn flesh" (see Ex. 22:30)</i>: A perforated gullet, a windpipe severed widthwise, behold this is disqualified. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, in addition, [an animal] whose nerve tissue was "emptied" [from the spinal cord (Hul. 45b:17)] is disqualified. [An animal that had] a broken spine and a majority of its [spinal] cord was cut is disqualified.  [An animal with] a withered lung, or if it no spinal cord is present, is disqualified. Rabbi Ya'akov says, even if it is perforated. If the liver is removed and there does not remain in it [a sufficient quantity of flesh] to allow a scab to form<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>כדי להעלות ארוכה</b></i>, it is disqualified. [An animal whose] inner stomach is perforated, or where the majority of the outer stomach is torn [is disqualified]. Rabbi Yehudah says, [a tear the size of] one handbreadth in a large [animal], and in a smaller [animal] if most of it [was torn], it is disqualified. <i>And how large [must the stomach be for an animal to be deemed "large"]?</i> Two handbreadths, behold, that is large. Less than that, behold, it is [a] small [animal]. <i>What is the "inner stomach"?</i> Ben Sheila, Head of the Seventy<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>ראש שבעים</b>; alt., <b>ראש טבחים</b> ("the head butcher") (see Minchat Yitzchak)</i> testified in Tzippori in the name of Rabbi Nathan: It is the cecum (Hul. 50b:2).
[An animal that is] clawed by a wolf in the chamber of the heart is disqualified [and a bird that is] clawed by a hawk in the chamber of the heart is disqualified<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see Hul. 3:1</i>. Rabbi Yehudah says, "clawed by a wolf" [is applicable to] small animals, but "clawed by a <i>lion</i>" [is applicable to] large animals; "clawed by a hawk" [is applicable to] small birds, but "clawed by a <i>large bird of prey</i>" [is applicable to] large birds. [If an animal] fell from the roof and crushed a limb or was trampled by one of its herd and crushed a limb: If it remains [alive] twenty-four hours and is [then] slaughtered, it is valid, [but] if it stood up immediately, then in either case it is valid.
[If] it broke most of its ribs, it is disqualified (Hul. 3:3). And how many are "most of its ribs"? Eleven ribs on one side of the spine, or eleven ribs on the other side of the spine. [If] it broke twelve [ribs] from both sides (i.e., cumulatively), it is disqualified. [If] there remained eleven  [intact ribs] from both sides (i.e., cumulatively), it is valid.  [If] it its hind leg is cut off from the knee joint and below, it is valid; from the knee joint and above, it is disqualified (Hul. 4:6). [If] a bone was broken and the junction of the sinews was interrupted, it is invalid. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar deems it valid because [the leg] can be cauterized and it will live. [If] a person caused its [lungs] to be shriveled, it is disqualified. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, [this rule applies if the shriveling is] caused by any living creature. Rabbi Meir validates a large animal [with a shriveled lung], but the Sages disqualify it. Said Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, Rabbi Meir did not disagree about whether a large animal [with a shriveled lung] is disqualified. Yehudah ben Yeshaiah the spicer testified before Rabbi Akiva that it was said in the name Rabbi Tarfon about the "large animal that is disqualified". <i>What is the "large animal"?</i> One that has been stripped of its hide and there does not remain enough [skin] to allow a scab to form. But if there remains enough [skin] to allow a scab to form, everyone agrees that it is valid. <i>And how much is  enough [skin] to allow a scab to form?</i> Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, up to [the size of] an Italian <i>issar</i> from the <i>beit chalalah</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>בית חללה</b> (the hollow area of the stomach in livestock) (Mishnat Eretz Yisrael)</i>, but not from the other limbs.
Among the [wounds to] limbs that [render an animal] disqualified [are] a limb that dangles from the animal and does not have enough [flesh between the animal and the dangling limb] to permit it to heal itself; flesh that dangles from an animal in insufficient quantity to permit it to heal itself; a broken bone that juts outside [the body of the animal] and the hide and flesh [around the break] are not sufficient to encircle [the broken limb]. How is it done? He takes [the dangling portion] and discards it, and [as to] the remainder, behold, it is permitted. Among the [wounds to] fetuses that are disqualified at four [months] for a small animal and eight [months] in a larger animal [are a fetus] that has two backs or that has two spines. Since it cannot remain [living] with these [deformities], it is disqualified. And these are valid (see Hul. 3:2): In livestock, a punctured esophagus or an esophagus torn lengthwise, these are valid. [An animal with] a broken spine but the majority of its spinal cord was not severed is valid.  [If] the liver was removed but there remained a sufficient quantity to permit healing, it is valid.  [If] the lung was punctured but the membrane remained, it is valid. [If] her womb was removed, it is valid. [If] the liver is wormy, it is valid. [With regard to] this halacha, the people of Asia Minor<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>בני עסיא</b> (see Hul. 48a:1)</i> ascended during three [consecutive] festivals to Yavneh [seeking a ruling], and on the third festival they ruled that it was valid. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, small intestines (דקין) that were perforated, but afterwards became stopped up again, are valid. A needle that is found [after the slaughter] in the thickness of the reticulum -- when it sticks out of (lit., "is seen from") one side, it is valid, and from two sides, it is disqualified. If a drop of blood is [found] in its place<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., on the needle (see Hul. 50b:11-51a:1 (Steinsaltz))</i>, then it is certain that [the perforation existed] before the slaughter, and if there is no blood [found] in its place, then it is certain that it occurred after the slaughter. If a scab covered the opening of the wound, it is certain that [the perforation occurred] three days before the slaughter, [but] if a scab did not cover the opening of the wound, [the status is uncertain and] the burden of proof rests on the claimant.
A <i>charuta</i> by the hand of Heaven is valid (Hul. 3:2). <i>What is a "<i>charuta</i>"?</i> Any [animal whose] lung is shriveled. There are among the [potentially disqualifying defects in] limbs those that are valid: An animal with a dangling limb where there remains a sufficient quantity of [attached matter] to permit healing; an animal with dangling flesh where there remains a sufficient quantity of [attached matter] to permit healing; a broken bone that juts out and the hide and flesh [around it] are sufficient to encircle it is valid. There are among the fetuses that are valid, a five-month fetus in small animals, and a nine-month fetus in large animals. [If a fetus] had five  eyes or three legs, since it is [nonetheless] similar to one that is qualified [for slaughter], it remains valid.
And these are the tereifot in fowl: A perforated gullet, a windpipe severed widthwise, behold, this is disqualified. [If] its head was injured by a weasel in a place that would render it a tereifa, it is disqualified. A perforation in the brain that penetrates the membrane -- it is disqualified. A perforation in the chamber of the heart renders it disqualified. <i>How do we check it?</i> Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of Rabbi Yehuda, we check it by hand and we do not check it with a needle. If the bone is perforated, it is disqualified; if not, it is valid. [If] it fell into a fire and its innards were scorched, it is disqualified<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">compare Hul. 3:3: "[If] it fell into a fire and its innards were scorched: If they [turned] green, it is disqualified, but they [stayed] red, they are valid."</i>. To which "innards" were they referring? To the gizzard, the liver, and the heart. § These [are the defects that nonetheless] render a fowl valid [for slaughter]: A perforated windpipe [or] a windpipe severed lengthwise, behold, it is fit. [If] it was injured by a weasel in a place that would not render it a tereifa, it is valid. [If] the heart was perforated, but not in the chamber, it is valid. [If] it fell from a roof and its bones were broken into pieces, or it crushed its fellow (i.e., another fowl) and its bones were broken into pieces, and it was slaughtered, it is valid. If it stood up immediately [after falling], in either case, it is valid. Rebbi says, even [if the crop] was gone (Hul. 3:4), but the Sages did not agree with him. [If] its wings were broken, [or] its legs were broken, [or] its feathers were plucked [it is valid]. Rabbi Yehuda says, if its down had been removed, it is disqualified. § Congestion of the blood, [or] stricken on account of smoke inhalation or sickness (Hul. 3:5). [If] one fed it  [injurious substances such as] <i>chiltit</i> (asafoetida), root of crowfoot, ivy-berries, deadly poison, chicken excrement, it is valid. The venom of a snake [and] the venom of a rabid dog do not disqualify [an animal] on account of being a tereifa, but they do disqualify on account of danger to life. The sign of a tereifa [is a female animal] that does not give birth to young. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, [any animal] that is not weakening and is able to walk is certainly not a tereifa, [but] if it was weakening and is able to walk, it is certainly a tereifa. Rebbi says, if it survives thirty days, it is certainly not a tereifa; if it does not survive thirty days, it is certainly a tereifa. They said to him, sometimes [a tereifa] survives for two or three years [despite carrying a mortal defect].
These are the signs in a [domesticated] animal [that render it permitted (Lev. 22:3)]: "In every animal with a hoof, a completely split hoof, [and that] chews its cud, such an animal you may eat." All those which chew their cud, they lack upper teeth. What ox grew horns before hoofs? This is the bull of Adam the First Man, as it says (Ps. 69:32), "That will please God more than oxen, [and more than] bulls with horns and hoofs." These are the signs in a wild animal: All that have horns and hoofs. Rabbi Dosa says, as long as it has horns, there is no need to inquire about hoofs. Even though there is no proof for this, there is at least a hint, [as it says,] "That will please God more than oxen, bulls with horns and hoofs." Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, whatever has an extra claw in birds is clean [and] every bird that seizes its prey is unclean (see Hul. 3:6). Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, whatever grabs [its prey] in the air and does not have a gizzard that can be peeled [is unclean]. Rabbi Eliezer son of Tzadok says, when you place [a fowl] on a rope, if it divides [its claws] two in front and two in back, it is unclean. Others say, whatever [bird] dwells amongst the unclean [birds] or are similar [in appearance] to the unclean [birds] is unclean, [and] whatever [bird] dwells amongst the clean [birds] and is similar [in appearance] to the clean [birds] is clean. The people of K'far Timarta that were in Judea would eat starlings<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"> <b>זרזירין</b> (see Hul. 62a:2)</i> because they have a crop of feathers. People from the upper marketplace in Jerusalem would eat the white <i>sinonia</i> because it had a gizzard that could be peeled.
And as to eggs, any [egg] that narrows [at the top] and is rounded, if it is known to be from an impure bird, and any [egg] that does not narrow [at the top] or is not rounded, if it is known to be from a clean bird, is clean (see Hul. 64a:2). They may take eggs from either of them and they need not be concerned lest [the eggs] are from carrion or from <i>tereifot</i>. They may not sell eggs from carrion or from <i>teriefot</i> to idolaters unless they are cracked open into a dish, and moreover, [the Sages] said, they may not buy from idolaters eggs cracked open into a dish.
These are the signs of [permitted] locusts (Hul. 3:7): All that have four legs and four wings and two jumping legs, and its wings cover most of its body. Rabbi Yosei says, and its name must be "locust" (<i>chagav</i>) and not <i>k'natzrin</i>, which [also] have all these signs. Summachos says, even the <i>mored</i>. Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yehudah says, if it does not have [these signs] now but will grow them after a period of time, like the <i>cholchazah</i>, it is permitted. These are the signs of fish: All that have fins and scales (Lev. 11:9). [If] it has scales, you need not inquire whether it has fins<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., since every fish with scales also has fins (Hul. 66b:2)</i>. [If] it has fins but does not have scales, it is impure. <i>What are they?</i> Scales are what covers it (i.e., the fish) and fins are what it swims with. <i>And how many scales must it have?</i> Even one under its cheek or one under its tail. Rabbi Yehudah says, two scales. [If] it does not have [scales or fins] now but in the future will grow them after a period of time, such as the <i>sultanit</i> and the bake-fish <sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>נפיא</b> (see Jastrow ("<b>אַפְיָין</b>"))</i>, it is valid. [If] it has [scales and fins] now but will lose them in the future when it comes out of the water, such as the colias and the <i>pilmis</i>, the <i>siftayim</i> and the tunny-fish -- ?<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Note: The Tosefta is defective here but the Gemara (Hul. 66b:1) supplies  "ה"ז מותר," "behold, it is permitted."</i> Rabbi Yosei ben Dormaska says, the Leviathan is a clean fish, as it is said (Job 41:7-8), "His armor (alt., "scales") is his pride, locked with a binding seal / One scale touches the other, and nary a breath may enter between them," [and] "His underpart is jagged shards" (Job 41:22) -- these are his fins.

Chapter 4

[With respect to] an animal having a difficult labor, [if] the fetus sticks its head out [of the uterus] and then brought it back [inside the uterus], and afterwards [the butcher] slaughtered [the mother], or [if] he slaughtered her and afterwards the fetus puts [its head] back in, it is forbidden [to eat the fetus without a separate slaughter]. [If] he cut it off and afterwards he slaughtered [the mother], she is permitted for eating and the fetus is forbidden. [If the fetus] stuck out its head or the majority [of its body] and then put it back in, behold, it is like a newborn calf.  [If the fetus] stuck out its foreleg and he cut it off, and afterwards he slaughtered [the mother], that which emerged [before the slaughter] is forbidden, and that which [remained] inside is permitted. [There is] a stringency regarding limbs that there is not regarding fetuses, and [a stringency regarding] fetuses that there is not regarding limbs. [The stringency regarding limbs is that] where the fetus sticks out its head and brings it back inside, it is forbidden [to eat the fetus without a separate slaughter], but if it sticks out its foreleg and brings it back inside, it is permitted. The stringency regarding limbs is that one who cuts up the fetus inside its mother's womb, [the pieces] are permitted to eat, but the spleen and kidneys are forbidden. An animal with a difficult labor: [If] the fetus stuck out its foreleg and put it back inside, and afterwards [the butcher] slaughtered [the mother], what it stuck out is forbidden and what remains inside is permitted. "The meat imparts the impurity of that which has touched a carcass," the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, "[It is like that which has] touched <i>tereifah</i>." Rabbi Meir said to them, "What would render this fetus [ritually] pure from [the impurity of] touch?" They said to him, "The slaughter of his mother purifies him." He said to them, "If the slaughter of his mother purifies him from the impurity of touch, does it not render him pure (i.e., fit) for us to eat?" They said to him, "A <i>tereifah</i> may be purified from the impurity imparted by touching, but may not be purified [to render it fit] to eat." Rabbi Meir said to them, "No.  If slaughter purifies her (i.e., the mother) as to something that is [part of] her body, would it [also] purify the fetus, which is not [part of] her body?" They said to him, "We have found that the power to save [from impurity] is greater as to something that is not part of one's body, than [that which is part of] one's body."  One who cuts up a fetus inside the womb of its mother: [The cut-up fetus] is permitted for eating, [but what is cut] from the spleen or from the kidneys is forbidden for eating.
One who slaughters an animal and finds inside it a living nine-month fetus, [the fetus] requires [ritual] slaughter, and it is liable for the gifts [of the shankbone, cheeks, and maw to the Kohen (Deut. 18:3)], and is forbidden under the laws of "it and its offspring you shall not slaughter in a single day" (Lev. 22:28), the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, It is not forbidden under the laws of "it and its young," as it says, "It and its young you shall not slaughter in a single day." That which requires slaughter is forbidden under the laws of "it and its young," but that which does not require slaughter is permitted under the laws of "it and its young," and exempt from the [priestly] gifts, as it says (Deut. 18:3), "from those that <i>sacrifice</i> the <i>sacrifices</i>." [Only] that which requires [ritual] sacrifice is liable in the [priestly] gifts. Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says, even if it is standing and ploughing over a furrow, one may tear it open and pour out its blood, cut it, and eat its flesh! Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of Rabbi Yosei HaG'lili, [such an animal carries] the impurity of food-impurity, and imparts the impurity of food-impurity, and must be rendered fit [for eating]. Rebbi says, it does not impart the impurity of food-impurity because it is alive, and a living creature cannot impart the impurity of food-impurity.
An animal that died, and he tore her open and found inside her a living nine-month old fetus, [that fetus] requires [ritual] slaughter, and he is liable in the [priestly] gifts, but it is disqualified from being placed on the altar because it is a <i>ben pekuah</i>.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Note: The phrase because it is a <i>ben pekuah</i>" is omitted in MS Vienna.</i> One who slaughters a tereifah and found in it a live nine-month old fetus, it requires slaughter and is liable in the [priestly] gifts, and if it is dead it is pure from the impurity of carrying because the slaughter of its mother purified it. One who slaughters a sin-offering and found inside her a live four-month old fetus, even after three [days], and even if it went "outside the curtains"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., outside the Temple courtyard (see Zev. 94b:13)</i>, it is is permitted to eat. If an animal in its first pregnancy miscarried the amniotic sac, it should be thrown to the dogs, but if [the fetus] had been consecrated, [the amniotic sac belonging to the miscarried fetus] must be buried, because its growth was consecrated. The amniotic sac does not disqualify [an otherwise valid] sacrifice, whether [it is eaten] outside the designated time or outside the designated area, nor can the thoughts [of the priest] render it disqualified, and one who offers it outside the Temple courtyard is exempt.

Chapter 5

"It and its young" (i.e., the prohibition against slaughtering a domesticated animal and its offspring on the same day (Lev. 22:28)) applies to kilayim<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., a mixed-breed offspring whose parents are of different species</i> and to the k'vi<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>כוי</b> (a hybrid species as to which the Sages were uncertain whether it was a domesticated or wild animal)</i>. Rabbi Eliezer says, this rule applies to a mixed-breed [offspring] of a ewe and a goat, but not to [a mixed-breed offspring of] a k'vi. One who slaughters "it and its young" as chullin inside [the Temple Courtyard] or as kodashim outside [the Temple Courtyard] [is liable]. One who slaughters a tereifah and so too one who slaughters and [afterwards] discovers that it is a tereifah, Rabbi Meir forbids [slaughtering the parent or offspring of that animal] under the laws of "it and its young." The slaughter [of an animal] for medicinal purposes, as food for idolaters, or as food for dogs is forbidden under the laws of "it and its young." A deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor that slaughtered at a time that others were watching them, it is forbidden under the laws of "it and its young." [If] no one else was watching them, it is permitted under the laws of "it and its young." These are the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, in either case, the slaughter is forbidden, but if it was slaughtered, it is exempt. One who buys [an animal or its offspring] from the homeowner, he takes precedence over the homeowner [in slaughtering on that day] because he specifically bought it for that purpose. Two that bought a cow, the first purchaser [has the right to] slaughter first, but if the second slaughtered first, behold, he is rewarded for his alacrity. [If] he slaughtered it and its mother, even up to five generations, he is not liable but for one. [If he slaughtered it] and the daughter of its daughter, even up to five generations, he is liable on the last one. [If] he slaughtered and then someone else came and slaughtered [the mother and someone else came and slaughtered<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Note: This bracketed text follows MS Vienna.</i>] the daughter, the two last ones are liable, and the middle one (i.e., the one who slaughtered the "middle" generation) is exempt. [If] he slaughtered five of her offspring he is liable as to all five for lashes. [If] he slaughtered five offspring and then slaughtered her, Summachos says in the name of Rabbi Meir, he is not liable but for one transgression. [If] he slaughtered her daughter and afterwards slaughtered her, and afterwards slaughtered her mother, the one who slaughtered the mother is liable and [the one who slaughtered] the daughter is exempt. [If the first] slaughter [occurred] before nightfall, it is permitted to slaughter her daughter at night. Once it becomes dark it is forbidden to slaughter her daughter the whole day and the whole night.
There are four occasions each year when one who sells an animal to his fellow needs to disclose, "I sold the mother [of this animal today] for slaughter" or "I sold the daughter [of this animal today] for slaughter," and they are the following: The evening of the last day of the Festival (i.e., Sukkot), and the evening of the last day<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "the first day" (see Ab. Zar. 5b:7)</i> of Passover, and the evening of Shavuot, and the evening of Rosh Hashanah. And according to the words of Rabbi Yosei HaGalili, the evening of Yom Kippur in the Galilee, because it is [also] a holiday. Said Rabbi Yehuda, in what case does this apply? When Yom Kippur falls on a Monday, but if it falls on a Sunday or any other day, there is no need to disclose, because this one (the first buyer) may slaughter it today, and that one (the second buyer) may slaughter it tomorrow.

Chapter 6

[The requirement to] cover the blood [of a wild animal or fowl] (Lev. 17:13) applies to mixed-breeds and to the k'vi. Rabbi Eliezer says, this applies to mixed-breeds from a goat and from a ewe. It does not apply [to mixed-breeds] from a k'vi. Rabbi Yosei says, we may not slaughter it (i.e., a mixed-breed from a k'vi) on a Festival because of the doubt [as to whether or not it is a wild animal], but if it was slaughtered, we do not cover the blood.  Said Rabbi Yosei, and what about circumcision, which is a definite obligation that overrides the Sabbath, but when it is a doubtful obligation it does not override a Festival, [thus] covering the blood [of a mixed-breed from a k'vi], that even when it is a definite obligation it does not override the Sabbath, is it not logical that where it is a doubtful obligation it would not override a Festival? They said to him, [the blowing of] trumpets [on Rosh Hashanah] in the outlying areas will prove it. That they are<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>שכן ודאה</b> not <b>שאין ודאן</b> ("That they are not")</i> definite obligations and they do override the Sabbath, and [even] when they are doubtful obligations<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., if it is unknown whether today or tomorrow is Rosh Hashanah</i>, they [nonetheless] override a Festival, they prove that as to covering the blood, that even though it is not a definite obligation<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., one is only required to cover the blood in the event that one happens to slaughter</i>, it overrides the Sabbath, would it not follow that when it is only a doubtful [obligation] (i.e., involving a k'vi), it [would nonetheless] override a Festival? Rabbi Elazar (=Bar Kappara) the son of Rabbi Elazar HaKappar responded, "And what [is noteworthy] about circumcision is that when it is an uncertain [obligation] it does not override a Festival, and when it is a certain obligation it does not override Festival nights (i.e., it cannot be performed at night). You must [therefore] say that with respect to covering the blood, that when it is a certain [obligation] it overrides Festival nights, since [all] certain [obligations] override Festival nights, it is logical that [even] if there is a doubt, it would override a Festival." Said Rabbi Abba, this is one of the things that Rabbi Achiyya<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "Rabbi Chiyya" (see Hul. 84b:9)</i> would say, "There is no refutation to this," and Rabbi Chiyya<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "Rabbi Elazar HaKappar" (ibid.)</i> refuted it.
One who slaughters for medicinal purposes, to feed to idol worshippers, [or] to feed to dogs is liable in covering up [the blood]. One who slaughters and renders [the animal] carrion through his actions, [and] one who [kills the animal by] stabbing or by ripping out [the throat], he is exempt from covering up. One who slaughters on the Sabbath or on Yom Kippur -- even though he is liable for the death penalty, as soon as it becomes dark [at the end of the Sabbath or Yom Kippur], he is [nonetheless] liable for covering if any of the blood remained. One who slaughters on a boat -- as soon as it arrives on dry land, he is liable for covering up if any of the blood remained, even though they said, "A person may not slaughter on a boat unless he has dust ready." One who slaughters and needs the blood [for another purpose] -- he should not slaughter in the normal way of slaughtering. <i>Rather, how does he do it?</i> He either stabs it [in the case of a wild animal] or he pinches its neck [in the case of a bird]. One who slaughters and dedicates the blood [to the Temple] -- he is liable to cover it up because the commandment of covering [the blood] takes precedence over dedication. One who slaughters and the earth swallows up [the blood without any act on his part], he is exempt, [but if] the wind covered it up, he is liable to to cover it up. One who slaughters is liable to cover the blood that is on the knife and the blood that is on the wings. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, since the blood was covered up by the sacrifice itself, he is exempt from covering it up. Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabban Gamaliel, the slaughterer needs to make a blessing [on covering the blood] itself. [If] he slaughtered and did not cover it up, and someone else saw it, [the other person] is liable to cover it up. Even on Festivals one covers up the blood. We may cover it by hand but we may not cover it by foot, as a commandment should not be performed in a degraded manner. <i>With what may we cover it and with what may we not cover it?</i> We may not cover it with straw, nor with stubble, nor with clipped wool, nor with bones, nor with feathers, nor with wings of a dove, nor with the sawdust of carpenters, nor with beaten flax, nor with tree bark, nor with <i>k'tzotzot</i>, nor with [coarse] flour, nor with fine flour, and nor may he place straw on top of the blood and cover it. But it may be covered with limestone, with gypsum, and with earthenware that was crushed and made into dust. This is the general rule: Whatever is a type of dust, is absorbent, and [plants can] grow in it, we may cover up [blood] with it, and whatever [plants cannot] grow in, we may not cover up [blood] with it.

Chapter 7

The [prohibition against eating] the sciatic nerve applies to mixed-breeds, [and] applies to two thighs -- the left thigh and the right thigh. Rabbi Yehuda says, it only applies to one, and logic dictates that it is the right [thigh]. This is the general rule: Whatever has a "spoon of the thigh" (Gen. 32:33), [the prohibition against eating] the sciatic nerve apply to it. Whatever does not have a "spoon of the thigh," [the prohibition against eating] the sciatic nerve does not apply to it. It applies to a fetus, and its fats are forbidden, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says, it does not apply to a fetus. And its fats are permitted, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. And the Sages say, they are trusted with respect to it <sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., butchers are trusted to have removed the sciatic nerve (see Hul. 7:1)</i> and with respect to [having removed the forbidden] fats. One who sends a cut-up thigh to his friend is required to remove the sciatic nerve [before sending it]. [One who sends a] whole [thigh] does not need to remove the sciatic nerve from it. One who buys a cut-up thigh from the butcher does not need to remove the sciatic nerve from it [since the butcher is trusted to have already removed it], but [one who buys] a whole [thigh] needs to remove the sciatic nerve from it. One who sells a cut-up thigh to an idolater does not need to remove the sciatic nerve from it, as long he does not sell it in front of another Jew, because he (i.e., the other Jew) may come back and buy it from  him (i.e., from the idolater, in the belief that the sciatic nerve had been removed). And on account of two things, they said, "We do not sell carrion or <i>tereifah</i> meat to an idolater": (1) because he may return and feed it to a Jew; [and] (2) another thing, is that we are not permitted to cause someone to be mistaken about what he is eating (i.e., the idolater would assume that Jews do not sell carrion or <i>tereifahs</i> and would come to be deceived, cf. Hul. 94a:5). And on account of two things, they said, "A Jew may not say to an idolater, 'Buy meat for me'": On account of [the idolater potentially being sold] carrion-flesh or <i>tereifah</i>. And one other thing: On account of force<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the idolater taking the meat by force rather than paying for it (see Hul. 94a:20-94b:1)</i>.
[To remove the] sciatic nerve, one digs out [the area] around it in every place that it is [found] and removes [all of] it. [With respect to] its fats, behold, they are permitted. Rabbi Yehuda says, [only] from the upper part of the thigh. There are two nerves:  The outer nerve next to the flesh is forbidden, and one is liable for [eating] it, [and] the inner [nerve] next to the bone is forbidden, but one is not liable [pursuant to Torah law] for it. One who eats from the sciatic nerve at least an olive's bulk, behold, he is liable. Rabbi Yehuda exempts him until he eats from both of them. [If] he ate [the whole sciatic nerve] but it was less than an olive's bulk, behold he is [nevertheless] liable. Rabbi Yehuda exempts him until the [sciatic nerve] is at least an olive's bulk. [If] he ate two sciatic nerves from two thighs from two animals, he receives eighty [lashes]. Rabbi Yehuda says, he only receives forty [lashes]. 
A thigh that was cooked with the sciatic nerve inside it: If it imparts taste to the stew, behold, it is forbidden. <i>How so?</i> We measure it as though it is meat [cooked] with turnips. [If] it is cooked with [permitted] nerves, behold it is [deemed to] impart taste. Rabbi Yochanan ben Berokah says, a nerve does not impart taste. [Relatedly,] a forbidden cut of meat that was mixed with [permitted] meat, even if they are one thousand, the entire mixture is forbidden. Sauce [is forbidden if it is mixed with a substance that] imparts taste. [If the forbidden substance] dissolved [inside the mixture], behold, it is deemed to have imparted taste [to the entire mixture].
[The laws of the sciatic nerve] apply to [ritually] pure [animals] but do not apply to [ritually] impure [animals]. Rabbi Yehuda says, even to impure [animals], because [the sciatic nerve] was forbidden even before the giving of the Torah [and thus predated the laws of purity and impurity]. They said to Rabbi Yehuda, it does not say, "Therefore the Children of <i>Jacob</i> -- Reuven and Simon [etc.] -- do not eat the sciatic nerve," but rather, "the Children of <i>Israel</i> [do not eat the sciatic nerve]" (Gen. 32:33). Those are the ones who stood before Mount Sinai. Rather, why is it written there (i.e., in Genesis, before the Torah was given)? To make it known why it is forbidden. [The laws forbidding eating the] limb of a live animal apply to impure animals as well as pure animals because it was forbidden to both the Sons of Noah (i.e., Gentiles, who are not liable in laws of purity and impurity) as well as to [the Children of] Israel. And [one who eats the sciatic nerve] may be held liable both on account of it being a limb from a live animal and on account of it being from an impure animal [in the event that it was indeed taken from a live and/or impure animal], the words of Rabbi Yehuda. And Rabbi Eliezer and the Sages say, one cannot be held liable except on account of it being a limb from a live animal, as it is said (Deut. 12:23), "You shall not eat the life with the flesh," and thus it is forbidden [to eat the sciatic nerve of a live animal]. On account of "You shall not eat the life with the flesh" they render him liable. This comes to exclude an impure animal, as to which all of it [and not just the sciatic nerve] is prohibited. One who eats the limb of a live animal transgresses a negative commandment. [Relatedly, with respect to one who eats] the <i>fats</i> (as opposed to the <i>flesh</i>) of a live animal, he is liable for transgressing two negative commandments, (1) on account of its [forbidden] fats and (2) on account of it [being from a] live animal. [With respect to] the <i>blood</i> of a live animal, he is liable for transgressing two negative commandments, (1) on account of [the prohibition against eating] blood (Deut. 12:23), and (2) on account of it [being from a] live animal. [The prohibition against eating a] "limb of a live animal" may render one liable on account of [the animal being] carrion. [One who eats the] blood of consecrated animals is liable on account of two negative commandments, (1) on account of [the prohibition against eating] blood, and (2) on account of [the prohibition against a non-priest eating] consecrated animals, the words of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Sages say, he is only liable for transgressing one negative commandment. [One who eats] the fat-tail of consecrated animals (see Lev. 9:18-20) is liable on account of two negative commandments, (1) on account of [eating the] fat-tail, and (2) on account of [eating from] consecrated animals. Rabbi Yehuda renders him liable for transgressing three [negative commandments]: (1) on account of [eating forbidden] fats, (2) on account of consecrated animals, and (3) on account of the fats of consecrated animals. 

Chapter 8

[The prohibition against eating] meat with milk applies in the Land of Israel and outside the Land of Israel, inside the Temple and when not inside the Temple, with <i>chullin</i> (unconsecrated meat) and with <i>kodashim</i> (consecrated meat). [As to] one who takes a vow from meat (i.e., that meat is forbidden to him), he is forbidden from all types of meat, [except that] he is permitted in the flesh of fish and locusts. Fowl may neither be placed [on the table] nor eaten [with milk products], says Rabbi Yosei. This is among the leniencies of Beit Shammai and the strictures of Beit Hillel. Beit Shammai say, one may place [fowl on the table with milk products] but it may not be eaten [with milk products], and Beit Hillel say, it may neither be placed nor eaten. Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Tzadok says, fowl may be placed [on the table] with cheese without any restriction (<i>afikolos</i>, cf. Hul. 104b:11, <i>"afikoren"</i>), [but] he says, it is not eaten [with cheese]. Others say in his name, it may even be eaten [with cheese]. <i>In what case does this rule apply?</i> In the case of a dining table, but in a table that is not a dining table, he may put a cut (of meat, presumably fowl) on one side, and cheese on the other side.  [One may also] place them into a peddler's basket with a leveling rod ("בקפוף ובמחוק," see Jastrow) (presumably to separate the meat from the cheese) and sling them over his shoulder [and carry them in this fashion]. Behold, [the Sages] did not forbid it except on a dining table. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel says, <i>even</i> on a dining table. Two that went to an inn, this one coming from the north and that one coming from the south, this one may eat his cut, and that one may eat his cheese, and we are not concerned [that one will share his food with the other, since they are strangers]. Behold, [the Sages] did not forbid [two guests eating at the same table in an inn, one meat and one cheese], except when all of it is handled together (see Jastrow, תְּפִיסָה).
A drop of milk that fell onto a cut [of meat], Rabbi Yehuda says, [it is forbidden] if it imparts its taste into that cut, and the Sages say, [it is forbidden] in the same cooking pot. Said Rebbi, the words of Rabbi Yehuda appear preferable in a situation where [the mixture] has neither been stirred nor covered, and the words of the Sages [appear preferable] in a situation where it is stirred or covered. Hot [milk that fell] inside a hot [meat dish], or cold [milk that fell] inside a hot [meat dish] -- these are forbidden. Hot [milk] inside cold [meat], he may rinse it off and eat it. The udder of [an animal] nursing [offspring]: he must tear it open and extract the milk [inside the udder]. [But] if he does not tear it open he does not violate [the prohibition]. The heart: he must tear it open and extract the blood. If it is cooked [with the blood inside], he may tear it open after it is cooked [and extract the blood].
An udder cooked with its milk is permitted. A stomach cooked [along with the undigested milk inside it] is liable. One who cooks meat with milk, behold, he is liable. <i>How much must one cook to be liable?</i> Half an olive's bulk of meat and half an olive's bulk of milk, in order that it adds up to an olive's bulk. In the same way that one is liable for cooking, one is liable for eating. <i>How much must one eat to be liable?</i> It suffices that he have eaten any amount of cooked food [containing a forbidden mixture of meat and milk]. One who cooks [meat] in whey is exempt (Hul. 114a:4); in the milk of a male [animal] is exempt (Hul. 113b:7). Blood cooked in milk is exempt. The bones and the sinews and the horns and the hooves the are cooked in milk are exempt. [A Kohen who] cooks <i>piggul</i> (a sacrifice that becomes unfit due to the Kohen's intention to consume it after its prescribed time) or <i>notar</i> (a sacrifice not consumed within its prescribed time) or an impure [animal] in milk is liable due to their being <i>piggul</i>, <i>notar</i>, or impure (which are all more serious violations than cooking meat with milk). [Ritually] pure meat from a domesticated animal [cooked] with milk of a [ritually] pure animal is forbidden for [the purpose of] healing or to derive benefit. Rabbi Shimon permits it for [the purpose of] deriving benefit. The meat of a pure domesticated animal [cooked in] the milk of an impure wild animal (such as a deer), [or] the meat of a pure wild animal or a [pure] fowl [cooked in] the milk of an impure domesticated animal -- Rabbi Akiva exempts the cooked dish, as it is said, "A kid," "a kid," three times.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see Ex. 23:19, Ex. 34:26, and Deut. 14:21 (and see Hul. 8:4)</i>.
[Initially the Sages held,] "The stomach of [an animal slaughtered by] an idolater, [or] of carrion, behold, this is forbidden [for curdling cheese]." [But subsequently] they retracted, saying, "[One may] curdle [cheese] from the stomach [of an animal slaughtered by] an idolater, and [one may] curdle [cheese] from the stomach of carrion, and he need not be concerned" (see Hul. 116b:16). Rabbi Yehuda says, [regarding] a kosher animal (i.e., one fit for slaughter) that suckled from a tereifa, its stomach is forbidden [for curdling cheese], and a tereifa that suckled from a kosher animal, its stomach is permitted [for curdling cheese], because the milk collects in the intestines.
[Sacrificial] fats are stricter than blood, and blood [is stricter] than [sacrificial] fats (see Hul. 8:6), for fats are [liable if taken from] a live animal and sacrificed on the fires [of the Temple altar], and are governed by the laws of sacrilege, and one is obligated over it for <i>piggul</i>, for <i>notar</i> and for impurity, which is not the case for blood. The stringency of blood is that blood can render [a sacrifice] permitted, valid, or <i>piggul</i>, which is not the case for fats.
Rabbi Yehuda says, [inedible] meat residue (האלל) that collects [together] and contains an olive's bulk, behold, it is liable [to convey impurity (see Hul. 9:1)]. The hide of the hooves of a small animal, behold, it is like its flesh, and [with regard to] all of these [skins] which were tanned, or trodden in order to tan them [afterwards], they are [ritually] pure if [these acts are done] for the purpose of the skin, but [ritually] impure if for the purpose of the flesh -- except for the skin of a person, which always imparts impurity. From this they said, [with respect to] a legion (<i>ligyon</i>) passing from place to place, [if a member of the legion] stands over it (i.e., the skin of a human corpse), behold, he is impure. There is no legion [whose soldiers do not carry around] scalps, and [indeed] all of them choose to do so. Rabbi Yehuda says, the lizard (<i>leta'ah</i>) does not have skin. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri says, the eight sheratzim<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., creeping or swarming creatures, of which the <i>leta'ah</i> is one (see Lev. 11:29-30)</i> all have skin, [and] one who traps them or kills them or wounds them, or one who leaves a mark on them [causing discoloration], behold, he is liable. But the Sages say, there is no [creature that is considered to have] skin except those which the Sages enumerated. One who flays a domesticated animal or a wild animal or an impure animal, or a small animal, or a large animal, in order to [use the skin as a] carpet, [its halakhic status remains that of flesh until he has flayed] a sufficient quantity to grasp it. <i>And how much is "sufficient quantity to grasp it"?</i> Two handbreadths. [With respect to] one who flays this amount, one who [then] touches the flayed skin is pure, [but one who touches] the skin of the neck is impure. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri says, one who touches the skin of the neck is pure, as he did nothing but separate them (i.e., the flayed skin from the skin of the neck). Rabbi Dostai ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon, one who flays [any of the] sheratzim, all [of the skin is considered] to be connected [for purposes of impurity]. Rabbi Yehuda says, [with respect to flayed] skin that has an olive's-bulk of flesh [connected to it], one who touches the [area of the] skin which is connected to the flesh on the other side, is impure. [With respect to] the egg of a sheretz in which [fetal] tissue developed, [one who touches it is] impure. <i>And how much [fetal] tissue must develop?</i> [Large] enough that one can see a sheretz inside of it. [But if the egg] is perforated, no matter how small, [one who touches the egg is] impure. <i>And how large must be the perforation?</i> The size of a hairbreadth. A limb or a piece of flesh that hangs down from a [live] animal is susceptible to food-impurity. Rabbi Shimon says, it is not susceptible to food-impurity.

Chapter 9

[The laws pertaining to the priestly gifts of] "the shankbone, the cheeks, and the maw" (Deut. 18:3) apply to kilayim as well as to a k'vi. Rabbi Eliezer says, as to kilayim, it applies to [the offspring of] a ewe and a goat, but as to a k'vi, the burden of proof lies with the claimant. One who slaughters for medicinal purposes, to feed idolaters, or to feed dogs is liable in the gifts. One whose slaughter renders the animal carrion, one who ripped open [or] tore loose [the gullet or windpipe], and the slaughter of an idolater are exempt from the gifts. A Kohen and an idolater that sold their animal to an Israelite to slaughter are liable in the gifts, [but if it] was slaughtered with their permission and afterwards he sold it, he is exempt from the gifts. An Israelite that sold his animal to a Kohen to slaughter is exempt from the gifts, [but if it] was slaughtered with his permission and afterwards he sold it, he is liable in the gifts.
A Kohen is exempt and one who partners with a Kohen [in the profits from an animal] is exempt. An idolater is exempt. One who partners with an idolater is exempt. One who partners with a Kohen needs to make a mark [on the animal]. [One who partners] with an idolater does not need to make a mark, and [as to any animal that is] disqualified from being consecrated, one need not make a mark. [If] a Kohen said to him, "Everything is yours but the foreleg is mine," even [if he said it as to only] one [animal] in a hundred, he is exempt from the [gift of the] shankbone. [If a Kohen said to him,] everything is yours but the intestines are mine, even [if he said it as to only] one [animal] in a hundred, he is exempt from the [gift of the] maw. In a place where they are accustomed to skin the head [of an animal], they are not permitted to skin the cheeks, and [in a place where they are accustomed to] scald a calf [in boiling water], they are not permitted to scald the shankbone and if there is a Kohen [nearby], they give [the priestly gifts] to the Kohen, and if not, they convert [their value] to money [and give the money to a Kohen when one is found]. § [If a butcher] sold the foreleg as it is (i.e., fully intact), the head as it is, or the intestines as they are -- they give [the gifts] to the Kohen, and they do not deduct their value from what they owe to the butcher. [If] they bought by weight, they give [the gifts] to the Kohen and they may deduct their value from what they owe to the butcher. § The gifts do not have any holiness, and they may even be sold [by the Kohen] to an idolater, or even given to his dog. They are not subject to any commandment except to give them to the Kohen. § One who sends meat to his fellow, and and there were gifts in it, they need not be concerned lest they are priestly gifts.
<i>What is the shankbone?</i> It is taken from the socket and all the socket with it. The "shankbone" of the Temple is the "shankbone" of the countryside. <i>What is the "cheek"?</i> It is taken from the place of the slaughter and the entire place of the slaughter with it. The "maw" is as it implies. The fats that are on the maw are given to the Kohen. Said Rabbi Yehuda, the Kohanim used to behave generously, and they would give it [back] to the owners. The "shankbone" is the right shankbone. You may say, is it the right shankbone, or perhaps it is only the left shankbone? [But] behold, you may deduce, since the [breast and] thigh (Lev. 7:33-34) is a gift to the Kohen, and the shankbone is a gift to the Kohen, since the [gift of the breast and] thigh are only applicable to the right, the [gift of the] shankbone also is only applicable to the right. The thigh is from the joint and downward, the words of Rabbi Yehuda, and the Sages say, from the joint and upwards. <i>What is the "breast"?</i> Whatever faces the ground and upwards, until it reaches the neck, [and] downward until it reaches the belly. Two ribs should be cut off and given [to the Kohen] along with it (i.e., the breast).  And these are the sacrificial parts [of the animal]: The two kidneys and the lobe of the liver and that which is attached to it. And these are the [sacrificial] fats: "The fat that covers the innards and all the fat that surrounds the innards" (Lev. 3:3, Fox tr.), those are the fats. [The fats] surrounding the rumen and all the fats that are on the small intestine, the words of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Yishmael says, the fats that are on the maw, and the Sages did not agree with him. [With regard to the fat] that is on the loins between the sinews, one scrapes around it in every place that it is found and takes it away, the words of Rabbi Yosei HaGalili. Rabbi Yishmael says, the fat that is on the maw, which is spread out [and possesses] a membrane, and is [easily] peeled off, is forbidden. Rabbi Yehuda says, the membrane that is on the kidney is forbidden, and one is liable [for eating] it. The sinews that are in the kidneys and in [other] offerings are forbidden, but [<i>bedi'eved</i>] one is not liable for them. 

Chapter 10

[The laws pertaining to] "first of the fleece" (Deut. 18:4) apply to tereifah [sheep], and do not apply to dead [animals], and do apply to kilayim (the mixed-breed offspring of a sheep and another animal) as well as to a k'vi. Rabbi Eliezer says, as to kilayim, it applies to [the offspring of] a ewe and a goat, but it does not apply to a k'vi&gt;. A Kohen and an idolater that [jointly] gave their  animal to an Israelite, [the animal] is exempt from "first of the fleece," and this is a stringency pertaining to the cheeks and the maw (see Deut. 18:3) that does not apply to "first of the fleece"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">as the Israelite would remain liable to donate the cheeks and the maw to the Kohen following slaughter in this scenario (see Minchat Yitzchak)</i>. All consecrated [animals] that had a permanent blemish before they were consecrated and [then] were redeemed are liable in "first of the fleece," but if they were consecrated before their blemish [developed], or [if] their temporary blemish preceded their consecration and afterwards they developed a [permanent] blemish, and they were redeemed, they are exempt from "first of the fleece." One who shears a goat is exempt from "first of the fleece." One who washes his ewes [and wool comes out during the washing] is liable in "first of the fleece." One who purchases [a sheep] from a homeowner is liable, and Rabbi Ilai exempts him. Partners [who share the profits of a sheep's wool] are [jointly] liable. Rabbi Akiva exempts them. [Regarding the purchase of a single sheep,] Rabbi Ilai says, there is no "first [of the fleece]" unless there is a "last [of the fleece]" after it. [<i>How many sheep render one liable?</i>]  [The midrashic exposition of the phrase "the fleece of your sheep" yields a minimum of] four<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">according to the school of Rabbi Yishmael son of Rabbi Yosei (see Hul. 137a:20)</i>, [while the midrashic exposition of the phrase] "you shall give him" [yields a minimum of] five<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">according to Beit Hillel (see Hul. 137a:17-19, and see Minchat Yitzchak here)</i>. One who possesses the wool of five ewes [worth] a maneh (one hundred dinars) and a half each, which weigh five selahs in Judean measurements, which are ten selahs in Galilean measurements -- he is liable in "first of the fleece," the words of Rabbi Dosa. And the Sages say, the fleece of five sheep, regardless of the value [of each fleece], weighing five selahs in Judean measurements, which are ten selahs in Galilean measurements, [when weighed after being] laundered and not [when they are] dirty. Not that one must launder the wool [himself], but must give the Kohen a sufficient quantity so that after [the Kohen] launders it, he remains in possession of [wool weighing at least] five selahs in Judean measurements, which are ten selahs in Galilean measurements, as it says, "Give (<i>titen</i>) it to him," so that he will have a quantity [commensurate with] a gift  (<i>matanah</i>). One who shears two sheep and leaves off, then shears [again] and leaves off, even though in the future [the wool] will add up [to the fleece of five sheep], we do not join [the shearings] together. If he sheared five [sheep] and leaves off, even if [when he resumes shearing he shears only] two and then another two, behold, these do join together. One who separates the fleece of his sheep, and lost [the separated portion], he is liable for its monetary value. "First of the fleece" -- the commandment applies to the beginning [of the shearing season]. [But <i>bedi'eved</i>,] if he gave [the first of his fleece], whether at the beginning, the middle, or the end, he has fulfilled [the obligation]. <i>What is the required measure?</i> One in sixty, just like terumah. One who purchases the fleece of his fellow's sheep and does not separate the first of the fleece from it, the buyer is exempt. This is a stringency in the shankbone, the cheeks, and the maw [where the buyer remains liable] that does not exist with first of the fleece. § [With respect to the commandment to send away the mother bird (Deut 22:6-7, discussed below)], geese, chickens, and Herodian pigeons that descended upon or nested in an orchard are liable [in the commandment of] "sending away."
A male [bird] is exempt [in the commandment of] "sending away." A male pheasant -- Rabbi Eliezer deems one liable and the Sages deem one exempt. An impure bird is exempt from sending away. A bird that is crouching on top of the eggs of a different species is exempt from sending away. [If the mother bird] was standing among them (i.e., the fledglings), one is exempt from sending away. [If] she was sitting on top of them, one is liable in sending away. [If] she was hovering over them at a time that her wings were touching them, one is liable in sending away. [If] her wings were not touching them, one is exempt from sending away. [If] the fledglings are tereifah, she is exempt from sending away. [If the] eggs [are unfertilized (Hul. 140b:14)], one is exempt from sending away. [If the] fledglings are able to fly and do not need their mother, one is exempt from sending away. [If] he took the mother and he did not have enough time to take the chicks before they died, or before they became tereifot, he is exempt from sending away. [If] he took the mother and afterwards took the chicks, he is liable in sending away. [If] he took the chicks and afterwards took the mother he is exempt from sending away. [If] one person took the mother and another person took the chicks, the one who took the mother is liable. One who finds nests in pits, ditches, or caves, they are permitted as to theft but forbidden as to sending away, and if [their wings were] tied, one is liable for theft and exempt from sending away. As to pigeons of a dovecote and pigeons of an attic (Hul. 139b:6, Steinsaltz tr.), they are liable in sending away and also forbidden with regards to theft, in accordance with the ways of peace.
[With respect to the ritual involving two live birds to purify a metzora (Lev. 14:4-8),] one who finds a nest shall not [use it to] purify a metzora, as it says "<i>v'lakach</i>" (i.e., "take" or "buy"). One who carries away the mother with her chicks, Rabbi Yehuda says, he is to be flogged, but need not send away the mother (Makkot 3:4), and the Sages say, he sends away [the mother] and is not flogged. This is the general rule: All negative commandments that require one to get up and perform [an act], one who [violates] it is not liable [for lashes]. A person must not take away the mother with her chicks, and even not to purify a metzora, because [the purification ceremony] will be performed through a transgression. § Rabbi Ya'akov says (see Hul. 142a:3-9), there is no commandment in the Torah whose reward is not stated next to it, and [as to which] the resurrection of the dead is [not] written in it, as it says, "Surely send away the mother [... so that it will be good for you]." Someone climbed to the top of a tree [and sent away the mother bird] and fell and died, and [another climbed] to the top of a building [and sent away the mother bird] and fell and died -- where is the goodness in that? [Rather,] it is said (Deut. 22:7), "so that it will be good for you" -- this is in the "good world" (i.e., this world) -- "and your days will be lengthened" --  this is in the "long world" (i.e., the eternity of the world to come).
