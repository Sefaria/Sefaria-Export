Tosefta Shekalim (Lieberman)



Chapter 1

On the 15th of this [of month Adar] - the officials of the court go out and repair the roads and streets that have been hollowed during the rainy season, [this happens] a time before the holiday, just before the pilgrims, so that these will be ready for the three pilgrims.
On the 15th of this [month] the officials of the court go and dig wells, cisterns, caves, and fix the basins and aqueducts of water. Any pool of water that has 40 sea [water] in it is suitable for making an [ritual] immersion bath. But in every pool of water in which there aren't 40 seas [water], one must lead a water channel and fill it up to 40 Sea, so that it becomes suitable for making a [ritual] immersion bath 
On the 15th of this [month] the officials of the court go out and declare the mixed crops as ownerless, For what the court has declared as ownerless is considered ownerless and is exempt from the tithes. If [a] man found mixed crops in a vineyard, it is lawful as "robbery" and free from tithes; but is in the field it is forbidden as "robbery" and he is obliged to pay tithes.
On the 15th of this [month] the officials of the court go and mark the place of uncleanness lest the people stumble.
One marks neither a clod of earth nor a fence, but [only] a [solid] stone. On does not set the marking in a place of uncleanness but in a place of purity, and whoever tents it is unclean. If he had found one marked stone, although one it is not done so, whoever tents [the place] between them is unclean, but above them - he is clean. One does not mark for [a piece of] flesh from a dead man, nor for a bone from a dead man, for they do not defile because of tent [impurity]; rather one marks only for the vertebral column and the skull, because they defile because of tent [impurity]. 
From the time they sat in the temple, they began to pawn. The Israelites were impounded for their shekels, with, of them the congregational sacrifices would be offered from. A parable[: What is this like?] for one who developed an ulcer on his leg; and a doctor tied him up and made an incision on his leg to heal it. So also said the Holy One, blessed be He: The Israelites shall be taken in pledge because of their shekels, those congregational sacrifices may be offered by them, for congregational sacrifices bring atonement and reconciliation between the Israelites and their Father who is in heaven. And likewise, we find in the offering of the Shekels that the Israelites paid in the desert, for it says: "And you shall taketh money of atonement from the children of Israel", etc. 
It is lawful to buy congregational sacrifices from Gentiles for money. And one may accept from burnt offerings and peace offerings, poultry, and grain offerings, wood, frankincense and salt [These are] words of R. Akiba. R. Jose the Galilean said to him: Even if you spend all day in interpreting the scripture [you will not find any proof of it]; one accepts only burnt offerings and peace offerings from them, but one does not accept a voluntary donation for the dedication of the temple repair fund; but if they have [already] consecrated it, their consecration is [valid] consecration.
Guardians who have paid the shekel for infants - they are obliged to pay an agio. Whoever pays a shekel [piece] is obliged to pay an agio. [These are] words of R. Me'ir; but the sages say: Whoever pays a shekel [piece] is free of paying an agio. Whoever pays two denarii [as a shekel tax] is liable to an agio, Whoever has given a sela to [recieve as surplus] a shekel is liable to 2 agios, [These are] words of R. Me'ir; but the sages say: just one agio. How much is [the] agio? [Answer] A Silber-Ma'a, [this is] the 24th part of a Sela [these are the] words of R. Me'ir; but the [other] sages say: Half a Ma'a of four Issar. What happened to these agios? They came to the Shekel [These are the] words of R Me'ir. R El'azar says: [They were considered] a voluntary donation. R Shimon Schezori says: [They were used for the] gold plates for cladding of the temple. Ben Azzai says: The money changers took them as their wages.
If he set aside [a particular coin for] his shekels [tax] and it was lost, he then set aside another in its place, but had not yet offered it when the first one was found, so both count as shekels [tax]; the first goes to the new, and the second goes to the old.
If [one] has set aside [a certain coin for] his shekel [tax] and spent it, he has committed embezzlement. If he spends [the coin for] another's shekel [tax], then he has committed embezzlement. If he bought for it the two doves of the male sufferers from gonorrhea, the two doves of female sufferers from flux, or the two doves of women who have recently given birth, his sin offering or his Passover offering or his reparation sacrifice, or [one pays the shekel [tax] which he [takes] from the temple property, because he bought [something] for it, embezzlement has been committed, [These are] words R. Shimon; but the sages say: He has not committed embezzlement until the blood has been sprinkled. 
One may not bring grain offerings, libations, a grain offering of thanksgiving, and bread of thanksgiving, from Tevel, or from the heave, and from the first tithe whose heave was not yet taken, and from the second tithe things sanctified that have not yet been redeemed, from things mixed, from new produce, and from seven-year fruit. But if [they] have been offered, they are not considered holy and it need not be said [that they are not to be offered] from orlah and mixed seed [kilayim] from a vineyard.
The surplus of wine [is to be] used for wine, the surplus of oil for oil, the surplus of salt for salt, the surplus of wood for wood, the surplus of incense for incense, the surplus of [frankincense] husks for [frankincense] husks, the surplus of lepers for lepers, and the surplus of Nazireans for Nazireans; if he said: "This is for this one Nazirean" or: "For this leper" then their surplus is a donation. The surplus of poor [is to be] for the poor, the surplus of captives for captives; but if he has said: "For this poor man" or: "For this prisoner", then their surplus belongs to him. The surplus of the dead [is to be] used for the dead; a dead man's surplus is for his heirs. R.Me'ir says: The surplus of a dead man is to be put aside until Elijah comes. R. Natan says [Of] a dead man's surplus, a memorial is built on his grave, or perfumes his bier. One must not spend [money collected for a certain] article of clothing on another article of clothing, and one may not ransom a prisoner in place of another prisoner, however, one may not offend the stewards regarding this matter.

Chapter 2

What does it mean "half [פרס]" before Passover and "half [פרס]" before Pentecost and "half [פרס]" before of Tabernacles? R. Yose the son of R. Yehuda says: Not less than fifteen days before the [relevant] pilgrimage festival. And why is it written on the baskets [which contain the shekels in the temple] "Alef, Beit, Gimel"? They write "Alef, Beit, Gimel" on it, because they started with the first and bring out of it. When the first was empty, you bring out from the second. When the second was empty, you bring out from the third. When all three were empty, and the time came to separate the [next] appropriation, one gives from the new, but if not, from the old one.
He went in to give the chamber appropriation, and they examine him as he goes in and as he comes out and converses with him from the moment he goes to the moment he comes out, to fulfill what is said: "Be clean before God and before Israel" And [further] it says: "And do what is right and what is good in the eyes of God" What is good - in the eyes of heaven, and what is right - in the eyes of men. [These are] words of R. Akiba. And it [further] says: "And find favor and goodwill in the eyes of God and of men"  R. Ishmael says The right thing [means also here:] in the eyes of heaven. The sages decided [that] the words of R. Ishmael [should be] supported, for it says: "For thou shalt do what is right in the sight of God," and here [it says] not “that Quality". And it says: "God, God, YHWH, God, God, YHWH, he knows, and may Israel know". 
He made the first [appropriation] and said [thereby]: "This is from the land of Israel for all Israel!" Then he covered [that which is left] with blankets, because the people come from Syria and pay the shekel on it. He made the second [appropriation] and said [at the same time]: "This is from Ammon and Moab and from the cities neighboring the land of Israel!" Then he covers [that which is left] with blankets, because the people come from Babylon and pay the shekel on it.
He made the third [appropriation] and said [thereby]: "This is in the name of Babylon and in the name of Media and the far-off lands for all Israel!" and he didn't cover. This [basket] was the richest of all, for there they found staters of gold and δαρεικός of gold. [Then] he pulled the blankets away and the remains got mixed up. But he did not mix with it the leftovers from the previous year, for perhaps someone had to separate [again] and they will be found giving from the old.
The appropriation can be given from what is pledged, what is collected and what is yet to be collected. [These are] words of R. Me'ir. But R. Yose says: One separates for what is raised and for what is to be raised.  R. Shimon b. Elazar says: This is only done with the last [appropriation], because perhaps some of the children of Israel will still be in a position to have to pay the shekel tax, and [then] he would pay it together with the people from Babylon. One commits embezzlement with them throughout their year, When their year is up, you don't commit embezzlement with them [anymore]. And these as well as those fall to the lodge of the Temple Repair Fund.
The women wove the curtains, the Garmu family made the shewbread, and the Abtinas family made the incense They got their reward from the lifting of the combs, the pots, the shovels, the mezammerot and the swiveling bowls and the implements the priests used come from the remains of the chamber. The golden altar and the garments for the priests and the garments for the high priest and cedarwood and 'hyssop and the crimson one Cloth come out of the heave of the chamber. The bridge for the cow ־ Abba Shaul says: The chief priests must buy them out of their own wealth. If the first man built it but did not use it when he died, his successor, although he had not yet used it, does not use it, but tears it down and builds another in its place. And more than sixty kikkar gold used to be spent on them, The ram offered because of some prohibition and the billy goats because of idolatry are required of them. [These are the] words of R. Yehuda. R. Shimon says They will be sacrificed by the appropriation of the chamber.
All the congregational sacrifices are offered on the first of Nisan. And when the new moon comes in time, one sacrifice from the New, and if not, one sacrifice from the old. And if one offered [Pinge] for oneself, they were [as an offering] valid; only on the condition that they had to be handed over to the public.
Administrators, who kept money for the poor, are not allowed to buy fruit for half the profit, because of the [danger of the] poor losing money [because of it], but they may buy from too low a market price and [resell] at a high market price. What is meant by ”summer” [קיץ] of the altar? One buys burnt offerings and ”summers” [מקיצין] the altar. If a man dedicates his property, and there are among them things fit for some congregational sacrifice, they are given to the craftsmen as wages, [These are] words of R. Akiba. Ben Azzai said to him: This is not the [proper] procedure! The worker who has done his work, whether for a 100 or for 200 [Zuz/Dinar], must not say: Give me this cow for a mine and this coat for 50 Zuz, for sacred things is not profaned by a job, but only by money. 
How was it done? The craftsmen's wages are segregated, redeemed against the money due to the craftsmen and given to the craftsmen as their wages; then they are bought back [with money] from the chamber.
If a man consecrates his property, and among them were cattle fit for the altar, [namely] male and female [animals], so says R. Eliezer: The male [animals] are sold for the need of burnt offerings, and the female [animals] are sold for the need of peace offerings. And the proceeds go to the temple repair fund with the rest of the fortune. R. Yehoshua says: The male [animals] themselves are sacrificed as burnt offerings, but the female [animals] are sold for the need of sacrifices for salvation, and for their proceeds burnt offerings should be offered. R. Yose said: The words of R. Yehoshua are the same as the words of R. Eliezer.
Once every thirty days the prices were fixed in the Chamber. Everyone who had sold them wine, oil or fine flour and said "give me the money from the currency circulating in my province !" no one would listen to him. And when they were poured out in the court, they were poured out on him. And if anyone at home has anything to bring, let him bring it so that it may be ready for someone who has nothing.
Once in thirty days one discounted from Chamber. Anyone who had sold them wine, oil, or fine flour and said: "Give me my money!" no one would listen to him. If he wants, he can go to a treasurer, and the treasurer gives him an order to a grocer. He is entitled to say to him: "Give me immediately for a discount!" There is no interest here, and one does not need to have concerns that it is a question of sacred things, [It is similar] also with one who sells an object to another under the condition that he pays him within twelve months, [also] he is entitled to say to him: "Give me immediately at a discount!" There is no interest here.
The chamber was opened once every thirty days. And everyone who had sold them wine or oil or fine flour and said: Give me my money in the currency that is in circulation in my province! he was not heard. He goes now to a treasurer, and the treasurer goes and reads and gives him of the money that comes into his hand according to the reckoning. If he wants to, he goes to a money changer and the money changer takes it from him and gives him the currency circulating in his province according to the reckoning. This is why all currencies existed in Jerusalem. 
These are the overseers that were in the temple: Johanan ben Gudgeda [was overseer] over the closing of the gates, Ben Totefet over the keys, Ben Rifai over the Lulab, Ben Arza over the tribune, Shemu'el over the ovens, Binjamin over the baked goods, Ben Maklil; over the salt and Ben Palek over the wood.
What did the three treasurers do? With their help one loosened Estimates, Bans, Sanctified and the Second Tithe out. And every work in the temple was done by them. What did the seven (Amarkalim) have to do? The seven Keys of the Court were in their hands, If any of them wanted to open, he could not do so until all had assembled, [Then] the Amarkalim open, and the treasurers go in and come out, and they go in and come out according to their order of rank out. R. Yehuda said: Why is his name Amarkal? Because he is Lord (אמר) of everything (כל). Eligible [for these offices were people] from the ranks of the priests as well as the Levites and the [ordinary] Israelites. If someone has a son, he has priority, a brother, he has priority. Everyone who has priority in inheritance also has priority in office, provided that he lives according to the customs of his ancestors. 
Four marks were in the sanctuary. [The stamp with the inscription] ”Sinner” applied [to the additional sacrifices to the three sacrificial animals of the lepers] including the log [of oil] belonging to it. As there was a chamber of silence in the temple, there was also one in every city, because the poor of good families secretly received their sustenance there.
Thirteen bowings were there. R. Yehuda says: In the direction of a gate, prostration, and in the direction of a breach, bowing. And all the other prostrations that were in the temple were about a sacrifice; they were fixed and prescribed.  and here and there there was no 'bowing', just kneeling and stretching out.
R. Eliezer says: The ark was banished to Babylon, for it says "Nothing (לא ... דבר) will remain, says YHWH". By "Dabar" is meant nothing other than the commandments (דברות) that [lie] in it. R. Shimon says: Behold! the [scripture] says: “After a year the king sent Nebuchadnezzar in and had him brought to Babylon in with the precious vessels of the house YHWH's”. [What are these] “precious vessels of YHWH's house”? This is the ark. R. Yehuda ben Lakish says: The ark was hidden in its place because it says: “And the poles were so long that the tips could only be seen in the sanctuary in front of the interior, but they were not visible to the outside. And they have remained there to this day." 

Chapter 3

There were thirteen collection shofarot in the Temple, and was written upon each one "New shekels", "Old shekels", "[money for] bird sacrifice", "[money for] doves for a burnt offering", "wood", "frankincense", "gold for the Ark Cover", and [the remaining] six [shofarot] for voluntary offerings. [What does] "New shekels" mean? which [was paid] every year; and [what does it mean] "Old shekels"?  Whoever did not pay a shekel tax in the previous year will pay it in the following year. Both these and those fall to the remnants of the chamber.
"Bird sacrifice" - If someone says: I have a bird sacrifice to offer, he brings the money for his bird sacrifice and puts it in the shofar. If he brought less, one does not accept it from him; if he brings more, the priest takes it and puts it in the shofar. And the surplus does not accrue to a shofar for voluntary donations. The priests pour it out and buy birds with it and offer half of them as a sin offering and half as a burnt offering. 
A woman who put the money for her bird sacrifice in the horn may eat of sacrifices in the evening. R. Yehuda says: There was no shofar there for bird sacrifices because of mixing, but someone said: I am responsible for turtledoves, so he brings [the money needed for this] and puts it in the shofar for turtledoves. [He said: I am in charge of] pigeons, so he brings [the money needed] and puts it in the shofar for pigeon.
"Wood" - If someone says: I am in charge of wood, he brings money for [at least] two logs and puts it in the shofar. The priests pour it out and buy sticks with it, which they offer on the altar. They benefit from it and commit no embezzlement. If you offer them outside, you are free And if ever mand said: I have those two sticks for the altar, so the priest takes them from him and offers them on the altar. They do not benefit from it, but they commit embezzlement with them. If they are offered outside, one is guilty. [These are] Words of Rabbi. But the [other] sages say: If one has offered them outside, one is free. Such and such fall to the wood storeroom. 
"Frankincense" - If someone says: I have frankincense, he brings money for a handful of frankincense and puts it in the shofar. The priests pour it out and buy frankincense with it, which they offer on the altar.
"Gold" ־ If someone says: I have gold, he brings money for a gold denarius and puts it in the shofar. The priests pour it out and buy gold for it and use it to make gold plates for cladding in the temple.
Six for Voluntary Donations - [The Shofarot. with this inscription] were for the surplus of sin offerings and for the surplus of trespass offerings and for the surplus of bird sacrifices of those afflicted with rivers and of bird sacrifices of those bleeding with blood and of bird sacrifices of women who have given birth, for the surplus of victims of a Nazirean and of a leprosy.
If someone says: This mine is for a voluntary donation or: This Sela is for a voluntary donation, he brings [it] and puts [them] in the shofar for voluntary donation. The priests pour it out for and buy 2 for it! Burnt offering The flesh is for God and the skins are for the priests.
Coins found in front of the Cattle Traders are always counted as [Second] Tithes. [Coins] found on the Temple Mount are considered profane [Similarly, coins found] in Jerusalem on the other days of the year are considered profane, but on the day of a pilgrimage festival all are considered as a [second] tithe. R. Jose said: [These are] words of the school of Shammai The school of Hillel says They are always considered tithes, except for the [coins] found on the Temple Mount on the remaining days of the year, [which are] profane.
Meat that is found stringed in the court is lawful, for meat of the sanctuary is not stringed. That which is found on a rubbish heap somewhere is allowed.
A gentile who brought his well-being offering, gave it to a Jew, the Jew may consume it; if he gave it to a Cohen, the Cohen may consume it. If a proselyte dies and the Israelites have divided his property among themselves and later it is revealed that it belongs to the sanctuary, it is taken from him.
R. Jose said: I have heard that whoever eats of the Most Holy after sprinkling blood pay the basic value but need not pay the fifth part. R. Ishmael, son of R. Johanan ben Beroka, says: He must pay the base value and the fifth part The priests buy sacrifices for salvation and offer them on the altar.
The curtain is 40 cubits long and 20 cubits wide, It was weaves “of blue and crimson and byssus, fine linen, goats’ hair - work of art weaving”. A second [curtain] there was, 20 cubits long and 10 cubits wide. It was woven “of blue and crimson and byssus, fine linen, goats’ hair - work of art weaving” and was spread out over the entrance to the sanctuary from outside R. Judah says: The one that was taken out from within was folded double and fourfold, and spread it [then] from without over the entrance to the sanctuary. It was said to him: Can something that has served the purpose of what is strictly holy serve for what is less holy?
Another explanation: In relation to this it is written: “art weaving work” and in relation to that it is written: ”color weaving work”. R. Nehemya says: art weaving work [means] two faces, and knitting work [means] one face. Rather, that [curtain] which was taken out from within was folded two and four times and spread out in the upper part opposite to the lower, for it is said: “And the veil shall separate you etc.”.
R. Hananya b. Antignos says: Two curtains were there, one spread and one unfolded. If the one spread out became unclean, the unfolded one was spread out. On the eve of the Day of Atonement, they brought in the new one and took out the old one. 
Meat of the Most Holy that has become impure, whether by a primal impurity or by a descendant impurity, whether within or without the school of Shammai says: Everything is burned within except what has been contaminated by a primal impurity outside.  The Hillel school says: Everything is burned outside except that which has been contaminated by a descendant impurity within. R. Eli'ezer says: What has been defiled by an original impurity, whether inside or outside, is burned outside, and what has been defiled by a descendant impurity, whether outside or inside, is burned inside. R Yehuda says: R. Eliezer speaks according to the teachings of the school of Shammai, R. Akiba speaks according to the teachings of the school of Hillel. 
The members of the daily sacrifice said to be laid below were laid on the lower half of the ramp to the east; the [additional offerings] said to be placed at the top were placed on the top half of the ramp to the west.
R. Hananiah h Akashia says: These and those were put on the lower half, but the daily sacrifices in the west and the additional sacrifices in the east; and the offerings at the beginning of the month were laid on top of the gallery of the altar.
What is the walkway of the altar? From one horn to the other the place where the priests go and onward.
A proselyte is prevented from eating sacrifices until he has offered his bird sacrifice. If he has offered a dove, he may eat of the sacrifices at supper.
All who are obligated to a bird sacrifice according to the Torah - [of their sacrifice] half is offered as a sin offering and the other half as a burnt offering, except the bird sacrifice of a proselyte. Though they are a obligatory [offering], both were to be offered as a burnt offering If he wanted to offer his obligatory offering of cattle, let him bring it dar. [Has he] [brought] a burnt offering for his atonement, then he has done his duty, offerings of flour and drink - thus he has not done his duty. Bird sacrifice was only said to his relief. If he had offered [sacrifices] for his leprosy, let him bring another for his atonement. 
The bird sacrifice of a proselyte applies only in the time the temple. But also in the present time he must bring it  R. Shimon says: He does not need to bring it in the present time because of the temptation to sin. 
Why was it said that [the law concerning the payment of the] Sehekel tax applies only to the existence of the temple?  Because one must not separate from the old donation.
Why was it said: [The law concerning the giving of the] firstfruits applies only to the existence of the temple?  Because it is said:  "You shall bring the first of the fruits of your land into the house of YHVH your God". As long as the temple exists, one must give up the firstfruits; if there is no temple, there is no obligation to give the firstfruits. 
A high priest may not enter the court for worship unless he has been anointed for seven [consecutive days] and clothed in the holy garments for seven [consecutive days]. Even if he wasn't anointed seven [days straight]. and has not been clothed in the holy robes for seven [consecutive days], and [nevertheless] performs his service, then this is valid. An ordinary priest may enter the court (to the service) only when he has brought a tenth of Epha of his own [property] and offered it with his own hand; if he has not brought a tenth of an ephah from his own [property] and [yet] performed the service, then this is valid.
A Levite may only enter the court for service if he has studied for five years, for it is said: "This applies to the Levites: from the age of twenty-five" etc. And further the [Scripture] says: ”From the age of thirty”. If it is said: “From the age of twenty-five” why is it said: ״From thirty years”? If it is said: "From the age of thirty" then why is it said: "From the age of twenty-five"? That means that he studied all the time between the age of twenty-five and thirty, from that point in time and onwards he was allowed to work From here it was said: Whoever does not show success in his instruction within five years, R. Jose says three years, because it is said: "To educate you for three years.
An elder is only assigned a place in the chamber of gazith if he has been a judge in his town.  If he was a judge in his city, he is promoted and assigned a place on the Temple Mount; from there he is promoted and assigned a place on the Hel, and from there he is promoted and assigned a place in the chamber of gazith.<br>This is the end of the chapter.<br>And this is also the end of the tractate.
