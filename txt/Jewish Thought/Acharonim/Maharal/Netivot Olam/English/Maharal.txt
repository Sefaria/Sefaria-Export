Chapter 1



Chapter 2

Since man was created as a physical being and
not just as a pure, disembodied soul, his pure
soul alone is not his complete essence. [In other
words, neither soul nor body alone represents the
essence of the human being.]
Rather, the essence of man is his power of speech
[for it combines these two components], which
is expressed by the physical organ of the tongue.
For man is composed of both a physical [body]
and a soul. Speech is unique to man, since
no animal can speak. Speech is rooted in the
soul [and yet is found in a physical organ] and
therefore is the essence of man [since it combines
the physical and the spiritual].
