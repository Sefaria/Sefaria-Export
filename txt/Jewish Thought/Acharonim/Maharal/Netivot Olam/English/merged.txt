Netivot Olam

Introduction to Netivot Olam

Regarding the Book of Proverbs (12), on the subject of tzedakah, life, and the path to death: Solomon, peace be upon him, wished to convey that when one is engaged in tzedakah, that person is infused with life, because the essence of tzedakah is to channel life into those stricken with poverty–to infuse them with life–and just as the person giving tzedakah receives life, so too do the poor, who are worthy of sustenance. Solomon said, too, that on the path to death–that is, when one walks on such a path without deviating from it, veering neither right nor left–death will not greet a man at all [if the path is properly followed]. And as far as what Solomon said regarding tzedakah and life, he spoke similarly on the matter of death. For everything is but one thing. For each remembers the taste. He said that one engaged in tzedakah–which is the infusion of life–will, in turn, be infused with life, and that regarding death, one who does not depart from the path of righteousness will not meet his death.
And regarding tzedakah, it is said in the language of 'guest,' for the guest is broad. Sometimes one may give tzedakah to the poor, and sometimes one may not give, and for this, it is not considered that he has departed from the path of tzedakah. It is similar to the guest, who is a wide path, for even if he veers a little, he does not completely depart from the path of tzedakah until he completely withdraws from tzedakah and does not give at all. Then it is considered that he has completely departed from the path of tzedakah. But the path is short and not broad, and when one exits and deviates a little from it, he has completely departed from it. And thus, when a person goes after his inclination to turn right and left, as soon as he veers from it, he reaches death. And it is said elsewhere (Proverbs 8:20), 'I walk in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of justice.' Tzedakah is called 'path,' for the path is broad, for even if one veers a little, he does not depart from the path for this reason. But judgment, when it even slightly deviates from the judgment, it is a corruption of judgment and justice, for judgment and justice should not depart from it at all. Therefore, it is called 'path,' for the path is short, and when something veers from it, it is called that it has departed from the path. And it is said that this matter that does not depart at all from the path, for this it is 'towards death,' which is removed from death.

...If one studies Torah only for oneself, then they set a limit upon what they might uncover, alone. And this is a shame, since the attribute of lovingkindness (ḥesed) in Torah is without limit. Therefore, study Torah in order to teach others in order for the study to attach itself to ḥesed.

... And when it says they died from Passover until Shavuot, the explanation is that this time, between Passover and Shavuot, teaches us about Honoring the Torah.  Because the counting [of the Omer] is 49 days, until the giving of the Torah.  Because the Torah is elevated, up to the 50th gate. And therefore we have the counting of seven weeks, one level after another, until we get to the 50th gate.  And they did not give honor to the Torah, for they did not show honor to their fellows.  And because as the Torah is elevated, so the days of counting teach us that the Torah is elevated to the 50th gate.  That is why they died specifically during this time between Passover and Shavuot.

And [the Talmud] further [recounts] ibid [Sotah 22a]: '[If] he has read [i.e., studied Scripture] and studied the Oral Law, yet did not apprentice himself to Torah scholars - Rabbi Eliezer says: this one is a commoner; Rabbi Samuel son of Nachmeni says: this one is an ignoramus; Rabbi Yanai says: this one is a Samaritan; Rav Acha son of Jacob says: this one is a magus. Rav Nachman son of Isaac said: The opinion of Rav Acha son of Jacob seems most plausible, as people say: A magus chants without knowing what he's chanting; a tanna teaches  without knowing what he's teaching.'  And the explanation of this [Talmudic passage] is that, when he studied the Law [lit: Mishna] but did not apprentice himself to a Torah scholar to clarify the reasons for the  Law - for it is a clear mind [that one has] when one has arrived at [lit: stood upon] the reasons for the Law - [such a one who has failed to do this clarification by appreticing to a scholar] is called a commoner [am haaretz] inasmuch as he did not acquire an intellect.  And Rabbi Samuel added [to this] to say that he is called an ignoramus [bur], for a filed that does not produce is called a fallow field [sadeh bur], just as the Targum of 
























......




"The Tannaim who erode the world ... [are scholars who] establish law based on the Mishnah [without the Talmud] ...” Rashi of blessed memory explained (Sotah 22a), “they establish law based on the Mishnah – and erode the world with mistaken decisions, for since they don’t know the reasons for the Mishnah, they compare a case to cases that    are not alike. Furthermore, they don’t know about the disputes of the Tannaim and therefore issue mistaken decisions.” So explained Rashi ... However, the interpretation is not like [Rashi’s] words at all, for saying that they issue a halachic decision from the Mishnah, implies that their decision is true; one cannot call it a halachic decision if it is a mistake. It would have said “they  teach mistakes from the Mishnah.” Rather, the interpretation is as we have said: the essential Torah is in establishing halachah, and this should emerge from the Torah, as the Torah is intellectual, the intellectual Talmud [and not the Mishnah’s mere outline] from which practical law should emerge, and this sustains the world certainly. So the Tannaim  who decide halachah from Mishnah destroy the world. But nowadays, if people would decide halachah from the Mishnah that would be enough, for [at least] the Mishnah is the beginning of the Talmud ... Instead, they establish halachah from collections of rulings meant for practical guidance – which were made just to issue rulings, but not to learn from. This is even further evil. The Rishonim, such as Rambam and Tur of blessed memory, even though they also wrote their rulings without explanation, they just intended to provide practical rules, based on what emerges from the Talmud. However, for one to establish halachah from it without knowing where the law emerged from, as a law without reason – that never entered their mind! ... If the authors had known that their works would cause people to leave the Talmud and would [determine halachah from] their works – they never would have authored them.   For it is better and more proper to establish halachah from the Talmud, even if one is worried that he will not follow the true path and decide truthfully, than that his decision should be accurate. In any case, a wise man has only what his intellect gives him and he understands from the Talmud, and if his wisdom and understanding lead him astray, still it is beloved to G-d ...

The Gemara in Masechet Megilla says: R. Eleazar said: What is the meaning of the verse, Who can express the mighty acts of the Lord, or make all his praise to be heard? (Psalms 106) For whom is it fitting to express the mighty acts of the Lord? For one who can make all his praise to be heard. Rabbah b. Bar Hanah said in the name of R. Johanan: One who descants upon the praises of the Holy One, blessed be He, to excess is uprooted from the world, as it says, Shall it be told to him that I should speak? Should a man [try to] say, surely he would be swallowed up. (Job 37:20) R. Judah a man of Kefar Gibboraya, or, as some say, of Kefar Gibbor Hayil, gave the following homily: What is meant by the verse, For thee silence is praise? (Psalms 65) The best medicine of all is silence. When R. Dimi came, he said: In the West they say: A word is worth a Sela’, silence two Sela's. (Megillah 18a, Soncino translation).

[Maharal repeats verbatim Bavli Ketubot 17b] This is the explanation. [What Beit Hillel said] Is not considered a lie; even though the bride is not beautiful and graceful, but in the eyes of the groom who chose her, she certainly is, and our praise is not an objective appraisal, but rather to acknowledge that her groom has found her worthy. After all, the groom has chosen to marry her, and she has found favor in his eyes. Therefore, it is written that: When a person makes a bad deal in the marketplace should you praise his purchase to him or should you disparage it? This means that it is not sensible to disparage his purchase after the fact, after all he likes what he bought. It is thus with the bride as well; we come not to praise her in the objective sense, but we come to honor the choice the groom has made because he thinks she is lovely. But what they say in the West: “No powder and no paint and no waving [of the hair], and still she ascends in grace.” This is more appropriate because in actuality she ascends in grace before the groom, and there is no deceit at all. For the grace is perceived by the one who is marrying her. This is why the verse states that "one should stay far away from deceit" (Exodus 23:7) — as far away as possible; one should not utter something entirely untrue. For grace is always in the eye of the beholder, as it is written: “And all who saw Esther found her to be graceful. (Esther 2:15)” Certainly not everyone held this opinion, but in the end, one found grace in her, and that was her groom. This is why it is not considered to be a lie. And this is clear.

The trait of humility is what causes one to merit Torah. It is as we say in the first chapter of Taanit (7a): Rabbi Ḥanina bar Idi said, "Why are matters of Torah likened to water, as it is written (Isaiah 55:1), 'Ho, everyone who thirsts, come for water.' [Because] just as water leaves a high place and flows to a low place, so too, Torah matters are retained only by one whose spirit is lowly, etc.," as was explained above in the Path (Netiv) of Torah. And we have already said above that humility has the most simplicity (as opposed to being compound and constructed from several elements). And hence this trait is fit for Torah, which is the simple intellect. And haughtiness is the opposite of this, as it is a material trait. And all of this is since a haughty person is the opposite of simplicity, since anything simple will not be distinct nor limited, whereas one who has pride in his character and his thought is separate from other people; so he is excessively distant from simplicity. And this thing is clear. And the Sages hinted to this in several places: In Tractate Shabbat (89a) in the chapter [entitled] Rabbi Akiva in a homelitical passage. As there they said [about Moshe], "Since you belittled yourself, the Torah will be called by your name." So behold they explained that humility is something intrinsic to the Torah. For they said, "Because of this, the Torah will be called by your name," because of the excessive humility that Moshe had, as Scripture testifies about him (Numbers 12:3), "And the man, Moshe, was very humble." Since he was unique in humility, he was unique in Torah. And that is since this trait, humility, is simplicity, and the intellect is simple. But a proud person, who deviates from simplicity, tends towards the material. Therefore they said in the first chapter of Eruvin (13b), "'It is not in heaven' (Deuteronomy 30:12) - it is not to be found in the haughty," as we explained this thing in very many places.

Since man was created as a physical being and
not just as a pure, disembodied soul, his pure
soul alone is not his complete essence. [In other
words, neither soul nor body alone represents the
essence of the human being.]
Rather, the essence of man is his power of speech
[for it combines these two components], which
is expressed by the physical organ of the tongue.
For man is composed of both a physical [body]
and a soul. Speech is unique to man, since
no animal can speak. Speech is rooted in the
soul [and yet is found in a physical organ] and
therefore is the essence of man [since it combines
the physical and the spiritual].

‎“Rami Bar Chama said: Great is repentance, since it brings healing to the world, as it says, ‘Return ‎wayward sons, I will heal etc.’(Yirmiyahu 3:22) Rabbi Chama son of Chanina considered an apparent ‎contradiction of verses. It says, ‘Return wayward sons,’ [implying that] they were only wayward ‎initially, and it says, ‘I will heal you from your waywardness’ [implying that they are still wayward ‎after returning]! It is not a contradiction; here it is [referring to] repentance from love, and here it ‎is [referring to] repentance from fear.”(Yoma 86a) …‎ Know that repentance is possible for a person because a person is created initially without sin, and ‎when he returns to G-d the person returns to that initial state. Because of this it is appropriate for ‎repentance to bring healing to the world, because healing is also a return to one’s initial state. ‎When people repent and return to their beginnings, the world also returns to its beginning and ‎‎[this] mends all the ruin that exists in the world.‎ Therefore, he said, ‘Great is repentance, since it brings healing to the world,’ [that is to say] when ‎the world cleaves to its beginnings, understand this. And he also said, ‘It says, ‘Return wayward ‎sons’ implying that they were only wayward initially.’ That is to say that as soon as he returns he is ‎healed, for this it is what is written, ‘Return wayward sons.’ And it is written, ‘I will heal you from ‎your waywardness’ [implying that] they need healing. He answers that this (the first case) is by ‎means of love, because one who returns to G-d out of love is certainly healed immediately upon ‎returning, because by means of the love his repentance is complete. And if he returns because of ‎fear his repentance is incomplete and he requires healing from G-d.‎ This is the difference between one who serves (G-d) out of love and one who serves out of fear. ‎Because the one who serves out of love possesses love and cleaving to G-d which is rooted in ‎himself… But the one who serves out of fear, this fear is rooted in G-d and therefore his final ‎healing comes from G-d and not from himself. These matters must be understood very well.‎

An explanation of: 'all of Israel are arevim [guarantors, responsible] one for the other' (Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 27b), which results from their being one people, this is not the case with the other nations in that they are not on people as is Israel. And [Israel] is similar to a single body, so that a wound in one limb will result in all limbs feeling the pain. So too, if one Israelite commits a sin, all the people feel the violation because they are like one body, because they are one 'people'. And when one has the opportunity to prevent the other person's sin, he sustains the whole generation, just like a main organ such as the heart. And if that organ is not performing its function and removes itself from engaging in its created purpose, to give life to the other body parts, a systemic failure derives from it, because that organ is created for the sustaining of all body parts. Therefore, any individual who has the opportunity to prevent wrongdoing and does not, becomes caught up in the violation committed by the other, since he had the opportunity to prevent it. For this is God's design, that each gives sustenance to all and if not, each causes ruin to all.

Chapter 1

..In the book of Proverbs (22) it states: " He who loves purity of heart and graciousness of lips is the friend of the king ".  King Solomon wanted to say that someone who has purity of heart -i.e. a good heart has purity of the heart.  The words 'a good heart' because that would imply that he has is good hearted in a general way (to others), but 'pure of heart' implies that his heart is pure to G-d as well (as others).  Therefore Solomon states that someone who has purity of heart is loved in heaven and has graciousness on the earth.  G-d loves such a person, and there is such graciousness for this person on his lips, and kings  choose him as a friend).  This is fitting for someone who has purityh of heart to the extent that he is good to heaven and to his fellow man.  We see in Ethics of our fathers, (where R' Elazar Ben Arach chose a good heart as the best road a person can choose) that Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakai commented: the words of R' Elazar Ben Arach include the words of the other sages, as someone who has a good heart is complete.  This is the meaning of the verse mentioned above - the lips are outside of the body, and the heart is inside.  When the heart is good, it allows good blood to flow to the entire body, even to the external parts of the body like the lips are good as well, causing everything to be good.  The opposite of this is someone who has a bad heart.  Just as the owner of a good heart is completely good, the owner of a bad heart is completely bad. It is for this reason that Rabbi Elazar ben Arach chose a bad heart as something to stay away from, and Rabbi Yochanan Ben Zakai agreed that this included all the bad things mentioned by the other sages.  Solomon said in proverbs (ch.26):"Like silver dross covering earthenware, are lips which pursue, and a bad heart".  this means that if a person attempts to hide his bad heart, it is nonetheless recognisable in his lips and his words which reveal the truth.  It is like someone who drosses silver over earthenware in order to hide its plain value.  There is nothing that can cover the badness of his heart.  Someone who has this characteristic of a good heart - when he has a good heart is capable of RUACH HAKODESH, as we see in the Medrash (Tanchuma): " He (Aharon) will see you (Moshe) and be happy in his heart.  Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai explained:  The heart who has joy in the greatness of his brother will be the one to wear the breastplate of the high priest.  The Medrash wants to tell us that someone who has a bad heart will not be happy when someone else is successful, especially when he is older in years (and therefore he should be successful instead!) there is no way that the holy spirit will rest on him, but someone who has a good heart and has a perfect (complete) heart will (achieve this level), because the heart is the element that sees with Ruach Hakodesh.  This is why Aharon merited to wear the breastplace - he had perfection of hte heart, when he had a good heart.
The characteristic of a good heart is defined as someone who desires and wants the good of his friend, and even if he sees something that appears to be bad in his friend's behaviour, he will judge him favourably.  All of this is because he desires the best for his friend, and therefore he judges him favourably.  the opposite of this is the owner of a bad heart, who judges his friend in a negative light, and this characteristic of someone who judges his friend favourably is a very good character trait.
In Masechet Shabbat (127B) it states:" We learned in a Braita: Someone who judges someone favourably we judge him favourably.  there is a story of someone who came from the upper Galilee and was hired out to work by a homestead owner for 3 years.  When, after 3 years he asked for his wages so he could feed his wife and children, the owner replied that he had no money.  The worker asked for produce or land in place of the money owed, and the owner replied he had none.  The worker asked for pillows and blankets...



he (Aharon) will see you (Moses) and be happy in his heart"

Chapter 1

In the Book of Proverbs (14:29) [it says]: "He that is slow to anger is of great understanding; But he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly." King Solomon wanted to say that a person who does not anger easily is of great understanding, and this is as Solomon says in Ecclesiastes (7:9): "For anger resteth in the bosom of fools." And this is because when anger easily excites someone, all of this excitement is material in nature, and therefore he [Solomon] says 'For anger resteth in the bosom of fools' and the fool is far from one who is enlightened by higher elements, but one who is a possessor of slowness to anger [lit. of long breath] is slow to anger, and this teaches that he is of great understanding – because he is enlightened by his higher elements, therefore he is slow to anger. And he [Solomon] says “But he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly” – this means when someone is of hasty spirit, this means folly is exalted out of them as one sifts out gold, because even if he is intelligent, in any case when he is quick to anger this exalts his folly. And in another place (Proverbs, 16:32), he [Solomon] says: “He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; And he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city”, read: one who is slow to anger is mighty because he stands like a hero and is not easily excited, and one who rules and conquers his spirit so that it will not leave him is greater than one who taketh a city, for one who conquers a city is conquering something material in nature, but one that conquers his spirit – this is something that is not material in nature, therefore he is greater. And this quality, slowness to anger [lit. of long breath], is from the qualities of God, may He be blessed, which is called ‘slowness to anger’ [lit. of long breath]....
In the first chapter of Masechet Eiruvin (13b): for what reason did the Beit Hillel merit to establish the Halakha according to them? Because they were calm when they were insulted and they would teach both their teachings and the teachings of the Beit Shamai. Furthermore, they would place the teachings of Beit Shamai before their own, as we learn in our Mishnah (Sukkah 28b): “one whose head and most of him were in the Sukkah, and his table is in the house – Beit Shamai validate and Beit Hillel validate. Beit Hillel said to Beit Shamai: was there not such an incident that the elders of Beit Shamai and the elders of Beit Hillel went to visit Rabbi Yochanan ben Hachorani etc.” From this understand and know that this quality is one who is centered, for one who is centered does not stray from the straight path at all, and he maintains his equilibrium, the opposite of someone who is not centered and because of this strays from equilibrium. And because of this, Beit Hillel merited that the Halakha is established according to them, because they were masters of calmness and they were not like Beit Shamai who acted with strictness, and it is known that strictness because of great anger leads to straying from equilibrium completely, and Halakha is the path which does not stray to the right or left at all – only walking with equilibrium and not swerving to the left or the right, and therefore what we call ‘Halakha’ is called ‘Halakha,’ because one who walks walks in straightness and does not tend from the straight and equal path at all, not to the right and not to the left; and this is the quality of Beit Hillel, that they had this quality in all of their conduct – they wouldn’t stray from equilibrium because they were centered. And don’t say that Beit Shamai weren’t wise, for on the contrary they were very wise and intellectually sharp. Only in the area of Halakha which is the path of the straight it is according to Beit Hillel because they were masters of calmness without veering from the order. And so they were [calm] even when they were insulted, and they taught their words and the words of their friends, and all of this refers to being completely calm, for in the case of other people, when someone says something to him, he is quick to become angry and to insult him back, while in the case of Beit Hillel they had the quality of being calm and did not insult even someone who insulted them. And so too when they taught their teachings and the teachings of Beit Shamai. Furthermore, they would put Beit Shamai’s teachings before their own. In all of these matters they were organized in their actions, and they were not from the group of highly competitive against their friends, and they were from the group that succeeds. And even though Halakhic discussions are nevertheless good, they [Beit Shamai] are not organized, and for matters of Halakha it is required that they not be not organized and are completely balanced. And all of these words that are mentioned [about Beit Hillel], they were well-organized and did not become disorganized. Even though the Halakha is not according to Beit Shamai, nevertheless the words of Beit Shamai are also the words of the Living God, as it is there. And this idea that they were stringent is because the attribute of Beit Shamai is also the attribute of wisdom, as it says: “if you see a Talmud Chacham, he takes vengeance and guards his hatred like a snake, gird him upon your hips”, and this idea we explained in its place, but with regards to Halakha it is fitting to be according to Beit Hillel for Beit Hillel were organized in their actions and did not stray from equilibrium, and therefore it was appropriate for Halakha.
And in the fourth chapter of tractate Pesachim (113b): The Holy One May He Be Blessed Loves three: one who does not become angry; one who does not stand on his attributes and one who is not drunk. This statement is hinting at profound wisdom, for one who has these three is fitting for the love; for in these three attributes one is similar to the Creator of All, and one who is similar is loved by one who is similar. And know that HaShem May He Be Blessed is not affected in the way that material items are affected, or in that way that something that is a physical force is also affected. And so HaShem May He Be Blessed does not have definitions [lit. a fence], for a definition is composed of a fence that is separate, and any thing that is composed [of something] has the quality of being material, and thus all of them are attributes of the material. And therefore [the Gemara] said one who does not anger behold he is not affected like the physical, and as was explained above when one is slow to anger, he possesses an intellect which is completely separate, and thus one who does not anger is separate from the physical and in this way is similar to HaShem May He Be Blessed who does not have a physical force. And one who is drunk is completely physical for when he becomes drunk he has removed his intellect and he is physical, and we already explained this in many places and in the Path of Prayer we explained this, for the drunk is completely physical and thus the Torah forbids one who drank wine from entering a place of holiness which is separate, and he may not teach Torah which is intellectual. And one who does not stand on his attributes, behold for this person there is no definition, for one who has definition does not ever stray from his definition, and thus does not stray from his attributes and only stands within his definition, but one who does not stand on his attributes does not have a definition and he actually is not physical and in that sense is similar to HaShem May He Be Blessed who does not have a definition, and thus HaShem May He Be Blessed loves one who does not have any of these three things because the similar loves the one who is similar to him, and when one has these three things, there is a similarity in that He May He Be Blessed is separate from the physical and this is an essence of His Self, May He May Be Blessed. And all of these three each one is further from the physical: for the drunk is completely physical; and when one does not anger he is not affected and is not like something which has a physical force in that that a physical force affects it in a physical manner; and one who stands on his attributes has a physical element in that he has definition and the definition is a border which is connected to physical; and these words are words of extreme wisdom. And it should be made clear to you that one who has the quality of being calm does not have the quality of being angry, and follows after HaShem May He Be Blessed, and thus HaShem May He Be Blessed loves him. 
And in Perek Chelek (Sanhedrin 92a): Rabbi Elazar said: every community leader who leads the congregation calmly merits to lead them in the world to come, as it says: “For He that hath compassion on them will lead them, Even by the springs of water will He guide them” (Isaiah 49:10). And the explanation of this is that, more than any other, (the trait of) calmness is suitable for a community leader who leads the community, for every community leader that leads the nation with calmness – there will be tranquility for the nation according to how he leads and he will lead the community with calmness, and know that in this world the world is not tranquil, and when he leads the community and leads them in this world in a way that echoes the world to come, ‘for on tranquil waters he leads them,’ he merits to lead them in the world to come as well, for the world to come is completely tranquil, for now in this world it is impossible to be completely tranquil, and thus he merits to lead them in the future, for so it will be a completely tranquil world of quiet and security, and the leadership will be of calmness from every side.

Chapter 2

And in the chapter of ‘These are the Words’ (Pesachim 66b): Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: any person that becomes angry: if he is a wise man, his wisdom departs from him; if he is a prophet, his prophecy departs from him. If he is a wise man his wisdom departs from him – as it is written (Numbers 31:14), “And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host”, and it says (Numbers 31:21) “And Eleazar the priest said…”, implying that it (the wisdom/laws) became hidden from Moses. If he is a prophet his prophecy departs from him – from Elisha, as it is written (II Kings 3:14): “…surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshapat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee,” and it is written (II Kings 3:15): “But now bring me a minstrel.’ And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the spirit [hand] of the LORD came upon him.” Rabbi Mani the son of Patish said: any person who becomes angry, even if he is destined for greatness from the heavens is lowered. From where do we know this? From where do we know this? From Eliab, as it is written (I Samuel 17:28) “and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David and he said..,”, and when Shmuel went to anoint him with reference to all of [David’s brothers] it is written, (I Samuel 16:8) "
And in the chapter “The Morning Prayer” (Berakhot 29b): “Rabbi Eliyahu said to Rabbi Yehuda the brother of Rav Selah Chisda: ‘Don’t get angry and don’t sin; don’t get drunk and don’t sin; and when you go out to the path [to start your journey], consult with your Owner and go out, etc.” Rabbi Yaakov said Rav Chisda said: ‘this is Tefilat HaDerech [the Prayer for the Journey].’” This statement is surprising, for what is the connection between each of these? But this statement comes to inform that one should not remove his cleaving to the Name May He Be Blessed, he should only cleave to him, and regarding this it says don’t get angry and don’t sin. Behold the Name May He Be Blessed created man from body and soul, and the body is the material and the soul is the spiritual and they are opposites, and when man stands as is fitting, without leaning to one side, so the man stands in his equilibrium and cleaves to May He Be Blessed. And this idea is hinted at in [the Hebrew words for] ‘man’ and ‘woman’, because the body is like a woman and the soul is like a man, and the name Yud”Hey is between them when they are together as is fitting. And when the soul, with its strength, deviates from that which is fitting by way of anger; or when the drunkenness of man leads him to the material side to the extreme until he is all material, as was explained above, and when he leans to the material he leaves the center point and removes the cleaving [to G-d]. And because of this it says about these two ‘and don’t sin’, because immediately when a man goes to the extreme [lit. leans to the edge of edges] he leans towards sin, and thus it says, “don’t get angry and don’t sin; don’t get drunk and don’t sin.” And after this it says for there is a side that does not lean to the edge, it is a side of separation and removal from the cleaving: for when it is fitting for him to request the cleaving from May He Be Blessed, and he does not request the cleaving, behold he separates from Him, and this is in the hour where he goes out and the man needs the cleaving - it is the accompaniment - and when he doesn’t request the cleaving behold he separates from the cleaving, for the accompaniment is so that he will have a connection with May He Be Blessed, and He will cleave to the man, and therefore it is called ‘accompaniment’ from the language of “For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head” (Proverbs 1:9), and by way of these three things man does not remove or lean from the Name May He Be Blessed. And we already explained this in the Path of Prayer....
In the fourth chapter of tractate Nedarim (Nedarim 22a): “Rabbi Shmuel the Son of Nachami said: Rabbi Yochanan said: Anyone who is angry – every type of punishment of Gehinom shall rule over him, as it is written: “Therefore remove vexation from thy heart, And put away evil from thy flesh; For childhood and youth are vanity” (Ecclesiastes 11:10), and ‘evil’ is only Gehinom, as it is written: “The LORD hath made every things for His own purpose, Yea, even the wicked for the day of evil” (Proverbs 16:4).” And the meaning of this is that one who is on fire with rage is essentially Gehinom, because the power and greatness of the strength of Gehinom is connected to the power of fire, and thus it is said in every place [in rabbinic literature] ‘the fire of Gehinom’. And because man has a spiritual soul, when he becomes angry and departs from the order, every type of Gehinom rules over him, because the Gehinom also is a departure from the order of the world; thus every type of Gehinom rules over he who is angry, and thus it is written, ‘And put evil away from thy flesh’. And because his soul that is angry is spiritual, and he departs from the Name May He Be Blessed by way of the anger, thus the Gehinom which is also spiritual and departs from the balance rules over him. [Nedarim 22b continues…] “Rava Bar Rav Huna said anyone who is angry – even the Shechina is not important to him, as it is written (Psalms 10:4), “The wicked, in the pride of his countenance [, saith]: 'He will not require'; All his thoughts are: 'There is no God.'” Rabbi Jeremiah from Difty said: he also forgets his Torah learning and adds stupidity, as it says (Ecclesiastes 7:9), “For anger resteth in the bosom of fools,” and it is written (Proverbs 13:16), “But a fool unfoldeth folly.” Rav Nachman said it is known that [as a result of getting angry] your sins will be greater than your merits, as it says (Proverbs 29:22), “And a wrathful man aboundeth in transgression.” ” And that which is written that the Shechina is not important to him – this is as I will explain, for when a person is angry, he departs from the appropriate order and therefore leaves the order until the Shechina is no longer important to him on a large change, because the person is aligned with the Name May He Be Blessed, who is his Cause, and when he is angry he departs from the order, and thus it says also the Shechina is not important to him because he does not recognize his Cause, may He be blessed, when he departs from the order. And it is said also that he forgets his Torah learning, as it was explained above, because his wisdom is the organization of his intellect, from the angle that he departs from the order and therefore his intellect leaves him. And thus that which is written that he is a sinner is also this idea, for every sinner departs from the fitting path, which the Name May He Be Blessed set for him, and because of this he is a sinner, and this idea is obvious. And these three ideas mentioned here - that the Shechina is not important to him, and that he forgets his Torah learning, and that he becomes a sinner – each one adds to the other: when the Shechina is not important to him, this is the primary root [lit. first] – when therefore he departs from the order until the Shechina is no longer important to him; and more, when his wisdom is removed from him when he does this there is an impression on himself until his wisdom departs from him; and it adds even more that he becomes a sinner himself. And this is also because the anger is a completely foreign departure from the fitting order until he will find these three ideas, which are foreign, and by way of these three he will depart from the order in everything when he understands these three ideas. ...
In the first chapter of masechet Gittin (Gittin 6b; Gittin 7a): “Rav Chisda said: a man should never impose too much awe in his home, for behold the concubine in Gibeah (Judges 19) – her husband imposed too much awe, and cause tens of thousands to fall from Israel. Rabbi Yehuda said that Rav said: anyone who imposes excessive awe within his home – in the end he will come to the hands of the three transgressions: immoral sexual acts, spilling of blood [i.e. murder], and desecration of the Sabbath. Rava Bar Rav Chana said this is what the rabbis say: a man is required to say three things in his home on the eve of the Sabbath as it gets darker: Did you tithe? Did you prepare the eruvs? Did you light the candle? He is required to say them calmly in order that they will accept from him. Rav Ashi said I did not hear this statement from Rava Bar Rav Chana, but I understood it through logic.” Behold the great punishment for one who imposes too much awe according to the great size of the thing that he did, which is too much awe, and he causes an alteration of every aspect of man. And these are the things: they are immoral sexual acts, spilling of blood [i.e. murder], and desecration of the Name, and this is the version of R”H. This is a change in every person, and this thing is a tremendous matter of wisdom how violating these three distorts a person completely: because immoral sexual acts are specifically connected to the body, and just as it says in the Writings (Leviticus 18:6), “None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness…”,  one who uncovers nakedness changes his body; and the spilling of blood changes the soul because one who murders sins with his soul and therefore it is called ‘spilling of blood’ because the blood is specifically the soul that is not inside the body; and the idol worship changes the intellect when the brain errs after idol worship; and so desecration of the Name will be explained in the Path of the Good Name, that this sin is a sin of the intellect. And these three things encompass all three parts of a person: body, soul and intellect, which are the three parts of the person, and therefore one who imposes too much fear within his home in which the fear acts on the person and since the fear overcomes the person it changes the person in these three parts of the person, and regenerate from this immoral sexual acts, spilling of blood and the desecration of the Name which are the three parts of the person and it is all from the force of too much fear. And it is important to understand the matter of too much fear that generates these three things when it is known to those with understanding and there is no need to continue longer here.
In the first chapter of Rosh HaShana (Rosh Hashanah 17a): “the minin and the apikorsim who deny the Torah and deny resuscitation of the dead, and separate themselves form the ways of the community, and they placed fear on the land of the living [i.e. they imposed fear on others], etc. ‘They placed fear on the land of the living’ - this is a parnes [secular community leader] who imposes too much awe on the community not in the name of heaven, as Rav Yehuda said that Rav said, any parnes who imposes too much awe on the community not in the name of heaven will not see a son who is a Torah scholar, as it says (Job 37:24), “Men do therefore fear Him; He regardeth not any that are wise of heart.”” And behold, the parnes who imposes too much awe on the community, he is like all of the minim and those who separate themselves from the way of the community, for also the parnes who imposes too much awe on the community, he separates himself from the community and is not included in the community. Of course, when he does it in the name of the heavens and for the sake of the community, this is not referred to as separating from the community, but when it is not for the sake of the heavens, then behold he separates from the community. And I already explained the matter of separating from the way of the community, which is separating from the Name May He Be Blessed, because He May He Be Blessed is called the God of Israel, and therefore it is fitting that one who separates from the community will be considered like one who separates from the Name May He Be Blessed, and this matter is clear. And that which is said that he will not see a son who is a Torah scholar, it’s meaning is (Kohelet 9:17) “The words of the wise spoken in calmness are heard,” and this we explained above, for every matter of the seichel [intellect] is calm, and organized, and the seichel does not leave the order like the other forces that are in man that act with their power, for it is not a matter of seichel unless it is organized. And therefore it is said that one who imposes too much awe on the congregation not in the name of heaven will not see a son who is a Torah scholar, because the seichel is also the parnes and the leader of all the limbs of the man, and it leads with calmness, and thus it is fitting that the man who leads the community without having to be admired by those beneath him, it is like the intellect of man that leads the city as they are all the limbs of the man, for man is called a city, as it says (Kohelet 9:14) “there was a little city, and few men within it,” etc., as was explained above. And just like it is thus with a person, so too it is fitting when leading a community, and if one does not lead the community thus, and only rules the community by force and imposes too much fear on the community, a son who is a Torah scholar will never derive from him, for how can a son who is a Torah scholar derive from him, since his leadership is not similar to the power of the intellect which is a parnes who also leads the community with order and calmness, and this matter should be understood.
