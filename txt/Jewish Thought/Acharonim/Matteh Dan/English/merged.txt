Matteh Dan

Title Page

the second kuzari
the great wise rabbi, educated in philosophy and in the seven wisdoms, rabbi dovid nito zt"l, the head of the bes din, argues and instructs through intelligent claims and strong proofs and with great wonders to prove the truth of the oral Torah that was received from our rabbis z"l, the sages of the mishna and shas ע"ר the first kuzari, because the whole point of rabbi yehuda halevi zt"l in his book the kuzari was specifically to prove the truth of the written torah, and he only spoke about the oral torah in general terms. and therefore through him and through me both the turths will become clear, and the opposing arguments will be stopped, and so it stands against the heretics like a valiant warrior going out to battle.
