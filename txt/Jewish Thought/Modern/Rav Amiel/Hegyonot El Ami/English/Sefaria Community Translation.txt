On Rosh Hashanah we call our Matriarchs for help - Sarah, Rachel and Channah. But we also don't forget Hagar the maidservant, the mother of the 'wild man." On Rosh Hashanah, we even read the events of her life in the Torah. For at the end of the day, Hagar also brought about that 'God should hear the voice of the youth.' Whereas our mothers, the daughters of Sarah, Rachel and Channah - and not of Hagar, God forbid - do everything in their power so that God will not hear the voice of their [own] sons and daughters! 
But isn't the voice - the 'voice on high' - heard even today?

"Please take your son, your only one, who you love, Yitzchak, and go to the land of Moriah; and sacrifice him as a burnt-offering" (Genesis 22:2).
People ask, "What is the novelty in this; have not many multitudes among the Jewish people sacrificed themselves for the sanctification of [God's] name?
However one can answer simply that it is because the essence of any thing is the first [time it happens], as the kabbalists explain. For the entire weight of a thing is in the descent of the thought from the world of emanation (<i>atzilut</i>) to the world of action (<i>assiyah</i>). But once the thought is already brought down by someone, the thing becomes easy for many people who have never at all heard of the name of the first one who came up with it to come up with the thought on their own.
So Avraham was the first one who enacted the sacrifice of oneself for the sanctification of [God's] name, and he paved the way for us. So we are only following in his footsteps. But the essence is always the first one to come up [with something].
