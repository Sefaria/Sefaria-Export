Introduction



Section 1

<b>Mussar Avicha: In Place of an Introduction</b><br>The necessity of composing. Notes for study and learning.
With God’s help
A.<br>It seems that a person can only fulfill their obligation in terms of the duties of the heart if they compose their own work relating to the studies that they need to pursue in this field.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><b>If they compose their own work</b>: See the commentary of the [Maharsha on Bava Batra 10b], which states that study that has the greatest impact is study that is combined with writing. Additionally, see the introduction to <i>Chovot Halevavot</i>,<i></i> where Rabbainu Bachaya explains the reasons he composed his work as follows: “It became difficult for me to remember it all by heart, and I was afraid that I would forget what I have learned of them, and that the ideas … would unravel in my mind … I decided to write them down in a book … so that I might expect of myself always to know them and bring myself to perform them …”</i> Both in matters particular to themselves as individuals and even in general matters [appropriate for others], the person [by writing this work] will gain in understanding through their own innovations. An individual who is already on an intellectual level such that they can formulate their own intellectual analysis can only attain perfection by utilizing their intellect.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><b> By utilizing their intellect:</b> In addition to serving as a personal "Mussar Sefer" to counter forgetfulness, there are two more reasons for the need to write on this topic, as mentioned in the work <i>Mesillat Yesharim</i> by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzato (the Ramchal). First, to truly grasp the concepts of <i>Avodat Hashem</i> (divine service), one must dedicate time, energy, and intellectual effort, just as one would to study other parts of the Torah. Second, in Chapter Four, the Ramchal explains that acquiring watchfulness (zehirut) requires analyzing the mesSages of the Torah and applying them according to one's individual understanding. Since each person is unique, their reflections and what resonates with their souls will differ from one another.</i>

Section 2

B.<br>[When a person begins to compose their own work on the duties of the heart] These are the [five] topics about which one should formulate one’s course of study in order to benefit oneself and others:
1. [Contemplating and understanding] About the true definition of faith [<i>Emunah</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><b>The true definition of faith:</b> This does not refer to what to believe in but rather what the meaning and understanding of our belief is, that is, what we mean when we say, “I believe.” See also Maimonides in <i>The</i> <i>Guide for the Perplexed</i> I:50, where he writes that “When reading my present treatise, bear in mind that by ‘faith’ we do not understand merely that which is uttered with the lips, but also that which is apprehended by the soul …” This means that the definition of faith (<i>Emunah</i>) is much deeper than simply saying the words; rather, it is a feeling and action of the soul. The understanding of faith in the worldview of Rav Kook can be best summed up in a quote found in Middot HaRayah: “faith in God is the ground in which all values of life bloom …” (Middot HaRayah <i>Emunah</i> 5). [See also <i>Olat Re’iyah</i>, Volume<i></i> I, pg. 336–338, 414.] Additionally, see the essays that elaborate on the theme of faith included in the Appendix: “Lights of Faith,” published 1928 in the <i>Netivah</i> journal, and “Call of God,” published in 1934 in the <i>HaAretz</i> newspaper.</i> Its form as it resides in the soul, its necessity, and the magnitude of its truth [<i>emet</i>], there being no higher level of truth [<i>emet</i>], based on that which is established and verified by reason and the senses, as is well known.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Is established and verified by reason:</b> Rabbi Yosef Albo, in <i>Sefer Ikarim: Book of Principles</i> 1:19, explains faith as follows: “Belief in a thing means a firm conception of the thing in the mind so that the latter cannot in any way imagine its opposite, even though it may not be able to prove it … Belief also applies in relation to a thing that the believer himself did not observe with his senses but that someone else—a popular and reliable person, or a number of prominent persons—observed at a given time and that has come down to the believer from the man or men who observed it by a continuous tradition from father to son.”</i>
2. About the truth of the Creator,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><b>About the truth of the Creator</b>: After explaining what faith is, Rav Kook moves on to expound what a person is supposed to believe.</i> which we possess from the Master of all deeds, may His name be blessed, and which was given to the faithful shepherd, our master Moshe, of blessed memory.
3. About the magnitude of [the Torah’s] holiness. About its exalted status. About the splendor of its luminescence. About the magnitude of bliss with which it endows those who study and contemplate it sincerely and purely. About the sanctity of its commandments and their splendor and how it is the world’s radiance and perfection, as is compellingly true and recognized by means of clear and proven ideas.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><b> Compellingly true and recognized:</b> [See <i>Olat Re’iyah,</i> Volume<i></i> II, pg. 55–56.]</i>
4. About the truth of the Oral Law,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><b>About the truth of the Oral Law:</b> This means that this tradition was meticulously handed down over the ages by the leading Sages of the generation and is an integral part of the Jewish tradition without which leading a true Jewish life would be impossible.</i> which the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded our master, Moshe, of blessed memory, and which was transmitted to the Sages from one generation to the next. [This Oral Law] is contained in the Mishna and Talmud and the works of the Sages of blessed memory that are associated with them. About the magnitude of [the Oral Law’s] truth and sanctity and bright luminescence and the greatness of the attainments of those who walk in its paths. About the sanctity of the streams that flow from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><b> About the sanctity of the streams that flow from it:</b> This refers to the sanctity of the teachings of the Sages. In <i>Orot HaTorah</i> 1:1, Rav Kook explains that the Sages receive their sanctity inasmuch as their words are the continuation of the process that started with the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. Every enactment of the Sages takes the “supernal light” of the written Torah and allows its values and ethos to permeate the daily living and actions of the Jewish people.</i>
5. About the truth of Kabbalistic knowledge.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><b>About the truth of Kabbalistic</b> knowledge:</b> Kabbala refers to Jewish mysticism, the esoteric and inner aspects of the Torah, its wisdom, and its knowledge. Rav Kook himself defines Kabbala as “the domain that deals with the knowledge of God, the domain of pure faith that stems from within the soul and emanates from the source of life” (<i>Orot</i>, pg. 101).</i> About the necessity for its existence. About the attainments of those who know it and are involved with it. About its universal benefit and that it is exalted beyond any sort of wisdom and is superior to any type of knowledge.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Superior to any type of knowledge:</b> Throughout Rav Kook’s writings, it becomes clear that he believed that without contemplating the esoteric aspects of the Torah, a person will not be able to actualize their full potential in their <i>Avodat Hashem</i>. See, for example, <i>Iggrot Re’iyyah</i> <i>h</i> letters 76, 87, 108, 414, 483, and 602. See also <i>Eder Hayakar</i>, pg. 13–15, and <i>Orot HaKodesh</i>, Vol. I, pg. 100 and pg. 361.</i> The necessity for the elite [Torah scholars] to engage in it with purity of heart and pure joy and modesty in order to know the Lord and cleave to Him, may He be exalted.

Section 3

C.<br>[After elaborating upon the five topics that should be included in the course of study, Rav Kook now moves on to explain the necessity for this educational and spiritual endeavor.] As long as a person hasn’t educated themselves to understand clearly the value of the human soul, the value of a Jew,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><b>The value of the human soul and the value of a Jew:</b> [See <i>Pirkei Avot</i> 3:14; Zohar <i>Shelach</i> 159b.] The complete Mishna in <i>Pirkei Avot</i>, as taught by Rabbi Akiva, states: “He used to say: Beloved is man for he was created in the image [of God] … Beloved are Israel in that they were called children to the All-Present ….” Additionally, the Zohar explains that the value of man is based on verse 1:27 in Bereishit, which states that man was created <i>Betzelem Elokim</i> (in God’s image)—meaning that man’s essential nature inherited an aspect of God, as it were. See also where Rav Kook elaborates on this topic in <i>Shemonah Kevatzim</i>, Kovetz 7, section 169; <i>Pinkasi HaRaya</i>, Vol. 2, Pinkas 41; and <i>Orot HaKodesh</i>, Vol. 2, pg. 359.</i> the value of the holy land,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><b>The value of the holy land</b>: This refers to the importance, centrality, and holiness of the Land of Israel to Jewish living. While there is a plethora of sources on this topic, only a few will be brought here as examples to highlight this idea. Midrash Tehillim 87:2 states: “God loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwelling places of Jacob,” and the Sifrei states in Parshat Re’eh 12:29 that mitzvah of dwelling in the Land of Israel is equal to all the other commandments in the Torah. Additionally, the Talmud states in quite stark terms: “Every Jew who lives in the Land of Israel accepts the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven, and everyone who leaves the Land is akin to one who worships idols” (Tractate Ketubot 110b and Tractate Avodah Zara 17b). [See Zohar Emor 93a, “one nation in the land”; and Tosofot’s commentary on Zevahim 60-61, the sanctity of the land and the Temple, and Tractate Megilla 17b, their status is raised up in Jerusalem.]</i> the proper longing that every Jew should have for the building of the Temple, and the greatness of the Jewish people and their advancement in the world,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><b>The building of the Temple … and their advancement in the world:</b> This means the coming of Mashiach and the dawn of the messianic age.</i> it is nearly impossible for them to partake of the taste of divine service [<i>avoda</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><b>It is nearly impossible for them to partake of the taste of divine service [<i>avoda</i>]:</b> For how is it possible for a person to fully experience something when they do not understand it?</i>
Our Sages of blessed memory stated<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">[<i>Sifrei</i>, Ekev.]</i> concerning the verse “And to serve [<i>Lavodo</i>] Him with all your heart”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 11:13.</i> that service of the heart refers to prayer. If so, prayer is of [a similar] nature [to] divine service, and [therefore] one is not fit for divine service unless one is in a mental state of divine reverence such that the elements of prayer are close to one’s heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><b> That the elements of prayer are close to their heart:</b> As Rav Kook explains in the next paragraphs, if a person has no conceptualization of a given notion, it is impossible for them to pray regarding it.</i> If a person is oblivious to the value of their soul, how can they pray wholeheartedly and with a sense of need that the Lord, may He be blessed, grant them knowledge, wisdom, and understanding? Given the fact that they are oblivious, since they possess wealth, honor, and all that is good, what are they lacking if, God forbid, they do not become wise and gain understanding?<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><b> That they are oblivious … what are they lacking:</b> If a person does not understand the spiritual nature of their soul, how will they be able to pray properly for their spiritual needs?</i> Therefore, a person must learn and delve into the matter until the magnitude of their deficiency and the need for knowledge, wisdom, and understanding becomes totally clear to them, that they thirst for it and pray lovingly from the depths of their heart that the Lord, may He be blessed, grant them these [attributes]. And the benevolent Lord will not deprive those who walk in purity of that which is good.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><b> Will not deprive those who walk in purity of that which is good</b>: This means that the effort a person puts into their prayers will be answered accordingly.</i>
And if one is unaware of the value of a Jew, how can one pray wholeheartedly for their redemption? Surely the desired intent in praying the blessing of “the redeemer of Israel” is not merely about one’s own personal suffering that one feels as a result of the burden of the exile. For the blessing’s content indicates that its intent is a function of Jews’ value and sanctity.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><b> Function of Jews’ value and sanctity:</b> The <i>beracha</i> in <i>Shemona Esray</i>, which Rav Kook explains here, reads, “Look, please, upon our affliction, and defend our cause, and redeem us speedily for the sake of <b>Your Name</b>”, meaning that the idea of <i>geulah</i> is not simply for the physical plight of the individual Jew; rather, it concerns redemption for the Jewish people to be able to fulfill their unique national mission in the world. The Ramchal explains in Part 2, Chapter 4 of <i>Derech Hashem</i> that the actions of the Jewish people have a direct impact on the level of Divine Providence felt in the world. [See also Megillah 17b; Rashi s.v. <i>Atchalta</i>: To free us from the travails that always afflict us, etc., for this is referred to as redemption; and Maharal, <i>Derech Chaim</i>, Chapter 6: For every salvation from the nations and from the hand of the rulers is all considered redemption.]</i>
And if one is unaware of the value of the holy land and its special qualities and sanctity, how can one pray for the rebuilding of Jerusalem, since prayer must come from the depths of the heart,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">[Tractate Berachot 10b.]</i> out of a sense of deficiency in that area?<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Out of a sense of deficiency in that area:</b> This reflects the understanding of the discussion on one of the underlying purposes of <i>Tefilah</i> as presented by the <i>Rishonim</i>. On the one hand, according to the Rambam, there is a daily obligation for <i>Tefilah</i> from the Torah (Hilchos Tefilah 1:1). On the other hand, the Ramban explains that <i>Tefilah</i> is not a Torah obligation but only a necessity when a person finds themselves in need and distress (Ramban’s commentary on <i>Sefer HaMitzvos</i>, “Mitzvas Eseh 5”). To bridge this gap, Rav Soloveitchik offers a novel explanation relevant to the topic at hand. He explains that even the Rambam believes that the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>Tefilah</i> only applies when a person is in need; however, the Rambam “regarded daily life itself as being “existentially in need,” inducing feelings of despair in the sensitive person. It is persistent "tzara, which exists daily,” and “real prayer is derived from loneliness, helplessness, and a sense of dependence” (<i>Reflections of the Rav</i>, pg. 80–81). Therefore, only when a person truly believes that they are lacking in a certain area will their <i>Tefilah</i> be effective.</i>
[Therefore] Prayer is an excellent test for a person to determine whether they are truly purifying their soul as the Creator, may He be blessed, desires and whether they have come close to aligning their will with that of the Creator.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><b> Aligning their will with that of the Creator:</b> Through prayer, a person can see if they have realigned their priorities with those that are of the upmost spiritual importance, as it says in <i>Pirkei Avot</i>, as taught by Rabban Gamaliel, the son of Rabbi Yudah Hanasi. He used to say: Do His will as though it were your will, so that He will do your will as though it were His (<i>Pirkei Avot</i>, 2:4; see <i>Olat Re’iyah</i> <I>I</I>, “Matters of prayer, Guidance for prayer,” Part 3, Section 5).</i>
Therefore, a person must be [extremely] careful not to be influenced by their desires in terms of the physical pleasures of eating and drinking and the like. For it will inculcate a materialistic nature in a person, causing them not to be self-aware of the lack of the true sacred things [and they will therefore not pray for the proper things]. [This will then cause the person’s] prayer to be forfeited. For it is a major principle in divine service that once a person is consoled by the fact that they have what they need to eat and be satisfied and other such vacuous things, when they pray the prayers of praise, <i>aleinu l’shabeach</i> (it is incumbent on us to praise) and <i>al kein nekaveh</i> (therefore we hope),<i></i> the person cannot imagine that the world will be repaired by means of the Almighty’s kingdom and the idols being wiped out and the wicked turning to Him, may He be blessed. For how do the idols harm one whose eyes and heart are fixed on filling his belly with delicacies?<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Whose eyes and heart are fixed on filling his belly with delicacies:</b> As can be found in the <i>pasukim</i> throughout <i>neviem</i> and the classical mussar <i>sefarim</i>, when a person is too full of the pleasures of <i>Olam Hazeh</i>, they very quickly lose the ability to focus on the Torah, <i>Mitzvos</i>, and <i>Olam Habah</i>. For example, see <i>Chovas Halevavot</i>, Section Three; <i>Mesilat Yesharim</i>, Chapter 3; and <i>Orchot Tzadikim Shaar HaAhava.</i> </i> While images of lust are in a person’s heart, they will not comprehend or understand.
Therefore, a person should strengthen themselves, be wise and devise a plan for [overcoming this challenge]. And we will beseech and pour out our souls before the merciful and benevolent God who desires our perfection, which is His honor and splendor.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Which is His honor and splendor:</b> When the Jewish people follow the proper path, it brings honor to Hashem.</i> He will guide us in His ways and illuminate them for us by means of His great light so that we may know and understand what He, may He be blessed, demands from us and what is the right and good way to walk in His paths.





Chapter 1



Section 1

With God’s help<br><big><strong>The Commandment of Reverence [<i>yirah</i>] of the Lord and Its Study</strong></big><br><i><small>In this section, Rav Kook will elucidate upon the importance of learning works of faith [emunah] and the difference between this study and the study of other forms of knowledge and the Torah.</small></i>
<b>A. The inner dimension [<i>penimiyus</i>] of reverence [<i>yirah</i>], and its establishment in the heart</b>
The saint, of blessed memory,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><b>The saint, of blessed memory:</b> The Ramchal, HaRav Moshe Chaim Luzzato (1707–1746).</i> writes in his introduction to <i>Mesillas Yesharim</i> that the veracity of the topics discussed in his work are universally known but are forgotten due to the nature of habituation stemming from their obviousness and familiarity.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><b>From their obviousness and familiarity:</b> In his introduction to <i>Mesilat Yesharim,</i> the Ramchal explains that, psychologically speaking, things that are well known are also those to which people pay very little attention regarding either their existence or deeper meaning.</i>
Indeed, the topic of divine service [<i>avoda</i>] in general, as well as reverence [<i>yirah</i>], love [<i>ahavah</i>], and cleaving [<i>devekus</i>], are universally known. However, this knowledge is merely knowledge of the terms, not the meaning contained in those terms.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><b> Not the meaning contained in those terms:</b> This means a superficial knowledge rather than an intimate knowledge and understanding of these terms.</i> Due to the sanctity of the depths of the discipline of reverence, for which all other disciplines are but preambles and prefaces,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Are but preambles and prefaces:</b> As the verse in Iyov states: “And He said to man, 'Behold (<i>Hen</i>), the fear of the Lord is wisdom and shunning evil is understanding’” (28:28). The Gemara writes in Shabbos 31b that in Greek, “<i>Hen</i>” means “one.” According to the Gemara, this is meant to teach us that only <i>yirat Hashem</i> is the true wisdom. See also <i>Derashot Haran</i>, Drush 5, where he explains that <i>yirat Hashem</i> is the foundation of the entire Torah.</i> it cannot be known to man by means of external speech alone, only through contemplation through internal dialogue.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><b> Only through contemplation through internal dialogue:</b> The Ramchal further writes in his introduction to <i>Mesilat Yesharim</i> that only through thorough analysis of the topics of <i>Avodat Hashem</i> will a person be able to truly acquire them.</i> This is the very reason for their obscurity: It is because most people, even Sages, are accustomed to disciplines in which their internal and external dialogues are equivalent. When one speaks about most disciplines, it is possible by means of that discussion to discern their depth and the need to study them in order to master them. It would not be possible for any intelligent person to imagine that he knows them unless he actually does. This is not the case when it comes to all aspects of the duties of the heart, where the statements taken superficially do not reflect the depth of the wisdom contained in them. There is no language adequate for [describing in full detail] all the fine points of understanding that they require, and one who does not clarify the matter properly will think that he knows the content [of <i>Avodas Hashem</i>] simply because he knows the terminology [that defines them].
It is therefore necessary to study so that he will be acquainted with them internally, and thereby his knowledge of the prerequisites for such awareness will expand to the point where he can also share his knowledge with others.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><b> Share his knowledge with others:</b> Only when a person completely and truly understands a topic can they share it with others in a coherent way.</i>
The underlying reason why these terms themselves are known to all is a function of nature.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><b> Function of nature:</b> This means the natural spiritual state of a person’s Neshama (soul).</i> For all aspects of the duties of the heart and its purification in refining the soul and all virtues are inherent to man, as they are the tools for all aspects of [spiritual] life. For example, the elements of reverence [<i>yirah</i>], love [<i>ahavah</i>], and cleaving [<i>devekus</i>] and the like are found in man’s soul and need not be invented per se.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Not be invented per se:</b> As Rav Kook writes elsewhere, “The soul’s demands point us to where a treasure of life is waiting. Thus, the happiness of a person is dependent on the ability to pay attention to these demands. This principle is true even when the soul is giving off vague noises, when it is impossible to recognize letters, words, rules, or explicit mesSages …” (Shemonah Kevatzim 8:56, translation courtesy of Rabbi Ari Zev Schwartz, <i>The Spiritual Revolution of Rav Kook</i>, pg. 17–18).</i> They merely have to be elevated so that they are channeled to the right path, meaning that they are all directed toward the Lord, may He be blessed, who is the ultimate hope. Wisdom in this area [of understanding the necessary aspects of <i>Avodas Hashem</i>] means understanding how all aspects of virtue are directed toward the Lord, may He be blessed, and His honor. This being the case, the terms [defining the topics of <i>Avodas Hashem</i>] per se are not the wisdom needed for divine service, but neither are they extraneous to it.
It is for good reason that the Creator, may He be blessed, instilled these capabilities in us.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><b> Instilled these capabilities in us:</b> As Rav Kook will explain in upcoming paragraphs, the constant journey of <i>Avodat Hashem</i> can only be attained if its attributes are natural and innate to the personality of each individual. It is because of this that people feel that they clearly recognize the concepts of reverence (<i>yirah</i>), love (<i>ahavah</i>), and cleaving (<i>devekut</i>), even when they are not able to clearly articulate what they mean.</i> True guidance to serve the Lord continuously should never depart from a person, even for a moment, but anything that a person attains is easily lost and is difficult to safeguard every moment unless it is innate. Therefore, the Lord, may He be blessed, compassionately fixed all these elements in our nature. When the intellect elevates them, then if a person follows the laws of the Torah of the Lord, may He be blessed, exclusively, these elements will truly remain permanently fixed in their heart, just as they were fixed naturally in them before being subjected to analysis.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Before being subjected to analysis:</b> After gaining the basic level of understanding, a person with the requisite intellect is required to study these topics in a deeper way. When this is accomplished, the person will be able to truly begin on their path of <i>Avodat Hashem</i>. (See the introductions to <i>Mesilat Yesharim</i> and <i>Chovat Halevavot</i>,<i></i> where this topic is elaborated on at length.)</i>
This teaches us the extent of the obligation to diligently pursue knowledge of the Lord concerning His comprehensive providence and incredible benevolence. For our only objective is that these virtues, which are fixed in our nature, should themselves be fixed permanently in this manner once it becomes clear to us that they are primarily intended to be used for the service of the Lord. This is the virtue of cleaving [<i>deveku</i>s], namely, that the virtues be permanently attached to the soul. Once they are elevated by means of knowledge, bringing one closer to the Lord, he will always be with Him. That being the case, it is impossible to fix these virtues in a state that is not their original natural state using means that would be inadequate for their original natural state.
What this means is the following: We see that man’s natural virtues can only be fixed in him based on knowledge, and his virtues are established based on his knowledge, whether true or false.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Established based on his knowledge:</b> This means that a person’s character traits are based on their worldview of right and wrong.</i> [For example] A minor who is completely undiscerning possesses no virtues whatsoever. When he grows up and recognizes that food is good, he will like it and will be angry at someone who takes away what he needs. As his knowledge develops, his virtues will develop accordingly. Therefore, when we want to establish all of [the virtues] within the framework of reverence [<i>yirah</i>], for the Lord and love for Him, it is necessary for knowledge of His proper ways and awareness of Him to be expanded, thereby conditioning the virtues. For [with] each deficiency in knowledge, the virtues will be lacking manyfold, as it is their root and foundation.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Their root and foundation:</b> Just as in the physical world, where virtues only develop through acquiring the commensurate knowledge of them, so too in the spiritual world. Therefore, a person cannot begin to grow their spiritual virtues in the right direction without a clear and deep knowledge of the concepts themselves.</i>
That which we said [above], that when the virtues are all established in connection with divine service they are not in accordance with their original nature, is purely as a result of the body.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><b>As a result of the body:</b> The fact that emotions, desires, and virtues are initially centered around physicality is due to psychological development. A child has an extremely self-centered view of the world, which gradually declines as they grow.</i> The virtues, per se, are certainly spiritual functions. However, their actions are linked to the bodily organs that carry them out and thereby transform them. The virtues acquire a sort of initial nature in terms of physical and deluded matters that are not in accordance with intellectual truth through the bodily capacities that precede them chronologically.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Which precede them chronologically:</b> This happens through the emotional and physical development of a person.</i> However, in terms of the soul, its primary nature is certainly for the purpose of virtue. When a person transforms their nature from an adolescent one, it is not a fundamental change but rather a reversion to their original nature. It is therefore possible for them to become fixed in him for the purpose of virtue, as it is innate to him. But if it were not innate, it would be an aberration by way of an accident [<i>mikreh</i>], and accidents are transient.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><b>And accidents are transient:</b> The internal and constant nature of <i>Avodat Hashem</i> has to be a permanent aspect of a person’s life. If this concept was not a natural occurrence within a person, then it would only be a transient phase that could come and go as it wishes.</i>
According to this, the truth is that the matters of truth are etched into our nature, and our soul will give it no rest (unless we actively confound it through distractions of luxuries or indecencies, which dim its light) until it attains its true nature, which is for all the virtues to serve the Lord. According to this, a person who shuts his eyes to contemplation of reverence [<i>yirah</i>] is severely robbing his soul by depriving it of its nature. It is just like one who shuts his eyes so he can’t see or constantly plugs his ears so that he can’t hear,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><b>That he can’t hear:</b> [In terms of the eye, any amount of closure is unnatural, whereas for the ear, it is one's constant plugging. See Ketubot 5b and Maharsha (ad loc.).]</i> thereby completely depriving himself of the use of one of his senses, and all the more so where he deprives himself of the use of all of his senses. Such a person certainly walks in darkness, as the verse states, “the path of the wicked is like darkness.”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><b>The path of the wicked is like darkness:</b> [Mishlei 4:19; Maimonides, <i>Eight Chapters</i>, Chapter 3.] See also <i>Mesillat Yesharim</i>, Chapter 3.</i>

Section 2

<b>B. The study of reverence and its wisdom</b><br><i><small>In this section, Rav Kook elucidates and delineates the difference between the wisdom of yirat Hashem (reverence) and other worldly wisdoms.</small></i>
It seems that the commandment of reverence encompasses all the studies that foster fear of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><b>That foster fear of God:</b> As the verse in Devarim states: “The day you stood before your God… Gather the people to Me that I may let them hear My words, in order that they may learn to <b>revere</b> Me as long as they live on earth, and may so teach their children” (Devarim 4:10).</i>
Our Sages taught<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">[Shabbat 31a.]</i> concerning the verse “Behold [<i>hen</i>], the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom”<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">[Iyyov 28.]</i> —<i>hen</i> is one [in Greek]—that this means that it alone is wisdom, as it states in the introduction to <i>Mesilat Yesharim.</i> This is astonishing, for wisdom is defined as that which requires investigation, and there are many other topics besides the study of reverence that require investigation.
The explanation is apparently that when it comes to all other studies, if a person delves into them and then presents his findings concisely to another, that other person will attain the same knowledge as the one who contemplated the matter extensively. As in the case of halacha, where doubt surfaces due to conflicting sources or difficulties that arise concerning the words of the Talmud or the halachic authorities, diligence and study is required to clarify the matter. However, after one clarifies it and concisely reports his conclusion to another, that person will now know it, just like the person who contemplated, investigated, and innovated it himself. This is not so in the case of fear of God. It is true that the study of reverence is like other fields of study in terms of establishing laws and principles, revealing to us the greatness of our Creator, may He be blessed and exalted, and there are places and issues that require elucidation and clarification. However, even after clarification, when one reports the summary to someone who did plumb the depths of the matters, that person will not understand.
The proof for this is that which the saintly Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto testified to in his work <i>Pitchei Chochma V’Da’at</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">[In the beginning of “Explanation of the principles of nobility.”]</i> that one needs to know the root of the insight and the crux of the matter. While it is possible to transmit the root concisely, it is impossible for one to truly grasp it without learning all the minutiae of its enquiry at length, for only then will he appreciate the significance of the root. It is, therefore, certainly true that only fear of God is wisdom, true wisdom, which cannot be transformed into mere knowledge lacking wisdom. But all the knowledge in the world, whether knowledge of deep halachic matters or knowledge of the innate nature of that which exists, is merely knowledge. It is just that difficulties arise in attaining that knowledge, necessitating our utilization of the capacity of wisdom in their pursuit as well. Man was only endowed with this capability in the first place for the sake of reverence.

Section 3

<b>C. Shunning evil [<i>sur mera’</i>]</b>
We can now also understand the conclusion of the verse that states, “And the shunning of evil is understanding [<i>binah</i>].”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">[Iyyov 28.]</i> The verse does not refer to refraining from doing evil, but rather to shunning evil. There are things that are known to be evil, that is, everything the Torah prohibits generally and specifically. That being the case, let us just “bring over a book and see”;<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">A common phraseology found in the Talmud.</i> when we study, we will know what actions to avoid.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><b>What actions to avoid:</b> Refraining from specific actions based on knowledge of right and wrong, good and bad is a simple conclusion not worthy of the title “understanding [binah].” Therefore, Rav Kook continues to explain what specific purpose the phrase “shunning” comes to teach.</i>
But shunning is not merely about a person refraining from doing; rather, it means that his lifestyle<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">[See Avoda Zara 6a. His lifestyle — his actions.]</i> distances him from evil. This is possible if he understands, in accordance with his intellect, the Torah’s intent to guard us from evil and truly sees how His will,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">God’s will.</i> may He be blessed, is to lead us to good. He will then shun evil willingly and out of true recognition.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Willingly and out of true recognition:</b> This means that in addition to following the letter of the law, the person will enact a change in their habits and personality in order to not be drawn to negative acts and desires in the first place. According to Rav Kook, the verse teaches us that this type of change requires not mere knowledge but rather “understanding [binah].”</i> This [task] varies greatly from person to person. Even though shunning evil is common to all, the means of shunning it are unique to each person, depending on his nature, situation, and intellect.
It is therefore impossible to term refraining from evil “understanding,” meaning deriving one thing from another. Although one must apply the power of understanding to know that something should be categorized as evil, once he knows the truth, it becomes a matter of straightforward knowledge, which does not require understanding, only obedience and memory. The outstanding sage R. Yashar Mi-Candia<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591–1655), also known as R. Yashar Mi-Candia, was a prominent Italian rabbi, author, and physician.</i> [Rabbi Joseph Solomon Delmedigo] already wrote in his work <i>Elim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The work <i>Elim</i> was published in 1629 and is a response to 12 general and 70 specific religious and scientific questions sent to Delmedigo by a Karaite Jew from Lithuania. [In a letter to R. Yoshiya.]</i> that the power of reason is what is required for analysis, but knowledge is a different capability.
To avoid evil, each person requires a different approach that is unique and specific.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Approach that is unique and specific:</b> This is as per the dictum “Train a child according to his way; even when he grows old, he will not turn away from it” (Mishlei 22:6).</i> It certainly requires exceptional understanding to comprehend how certain aspects of Torah and its ways affect him positively and sanctify him and thereby to act in a manner that is specifically suited to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><b>That is specifically suited to him:</b> This is similar to what is found in Orot Ha-Torah 9: “Every person must occupy himself in matters for which he has [the proper] preparation, this being especially true about [Torah] study ... There are those who have fallen into bad ways, because in their approach to study and spiritual perfection they betrayed their unique personal characters.” See also Orot Ha-Kodesh Vol. 3, pg. 221, number 19, “Derech Meyuchdet.”</i>
One must examine which individual paths are suitable for everyone, which are only suited to Torah scholars who recognize those paths, and which are suited to any righteous person in whose heart the Lord, may He be blessed, placed knowledge in order to know how to support himself with purity and righteousness. Anyone who wishes to understand can find many righteous paths that suit his nature. This is the meaning of the statement of our Sages of blessed memory, “Whoever appraises his ways in this world, merits seeing the salvation of the Holy One, Blessed be He.”<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Moed Katan 5a.</i>

Section 4

<b>D. Sin stupefies [<i>metamtemet</i>]</b><br><small>In the previous sections of this chapter, Rav Kook explained the importance of learning works of faith [emunah] and the difference between this study and the study of other forms of knowledge and torah. The next sections elaborate on the effects of sin on a person, the Torah’s safeguards, fear of Heaven [yirat shamayim] and fear of sin [yirat chet].</small>
“Sin stupefies the heart of a person”<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Sin stupefies the heart of a person:</b> This is explained in Tractate Yoma 39. “In the school of Rabbi Yishmael it was taught: Sin stupefies the heart of a person who commits it, as it is stated: ‘And do not impurify yourselves with them, so that you should not be thereby impurified’ (Leviticus 11:43). Do not read that term as: ‘And be impurified [venitmetem]’; rather, read it as: ‘And your hearts will be stupefied [venitamtem]’“ [Yoma 39a; see further Maharsha Shabbat 33a]. Additionally, many commentors on this Talmudic discussion explain that the stupefaction is also based on the adage in <i>Pirkei Avot</i> 4:2, “transgression leads to another transgression,” whereby a person, because of their constant transgressions, will not easily be able to break this cycle and repent.</i> by virtue of it being a sin. Therefore, there is no difference between a person eating forbidden foods and frivolous activity or wasting time that could be spent on Torah study. Aside from being a sin, it also stupefies his heart.
As long as he acts out of rote, walking in darkness, he will not notice his heart’s stupefaction until he begins to engage in divine service and study. It is like a person who fasts for several days, whose hunger is reawakened by smelling food. As is written, “For lack of the fruits of the field,”<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><b> Fruits of the field:</b> The verse in Eichah describing the dire straits of the Jewish people states, “Better off were the victims of the sword than the victims of hunger … pierced by the fruits of the field” [Eichah 4:9].</i> as they, of blessed memory, explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding this verse, Rashi explains that the people who were starving would perish after smelling the food of their enemies, which made them acutely aware of how hungry they were.</i>
Therefore, one should not, God forbid, continually “return to his vomit” (repeat their sins),<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">As per the verse in Mishlei, “As a dog returns to his vomit, so does a fool repeat his folly” (26:11).</i> because the stupefaction of the heart increases each time.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><b> Increases each time:</b> The effects of each sin build on each other and create a “spiritual callous” on the soul. These effects make it harder for a person to realize that they are traveling down the wrong path because they are spiritually numb to the dangers of their ways.</i> Since a person hasn’t yet completely rejected the evil, there is reason for concern that perhaps some small amount remains that will be reawakened, since it was not totally nullified. A refined person will direct their heart and mind to know what they face [in this regard].

Section 5

<b>E. The Torah’s safeguards [<i>s’yagot</i>]</b>
The matter of the Torah’s safeguards<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Torah’s safeguards:</b> This refers to forbidden actions that, although not Biblically prohibited, were instituted as off limits by the Rabbis. The Rabbinical necessity of this is based on the verses in Vayikra 19:2. “You shall be holy,” as the Ramban explains in his commentary there.</i> is not a function of the issue of leading to sin, per se. Rather, just as sin is innately evil, so too everything associated with it as cause and effect is also innately evil and should be completely avoided.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Completely avoided:</b> This means that that actions that are prohibited due to the safeguards that the Rabbis put into place should be avoided because they are in and of themselves problematic behaviors.</i>

Section 6

<b>F. Fear of Heaven [<i>yirat shamayim</i>] and fear of sin [<i>yirat chet</i>]</b>
<small><i>As an opening to the discussion of fear of Heaven and fear of sin, Rav Kook explains their meaning as well as how these concepts differ from one another.</i> </small><br>Fear of Heaven and fear of sin: Every [positive] act, especially when performed by the congregation of the Lord, Who chose us from among all of the nations and placed eternal life—an extremely holy soul—in our midst, induces perception of great matters,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Of great matters:</b> Based on a Kabbalistic understanding of the first verses in Bereshiet, Rav Chaim of Volozhin, in his seminal work <i>Nefesh Hachaim</i>, Gate 1, Subsection 3, explains that mankind’s physical actions in this world reverberate in the spiritual worlds above.</i> and its actions and conduct are cloaked in the system of divine wisdom inspired by Him, may He be blessed, and sealed with His seal of truth.
Therefore [based on this Kabbalistic understanding], any act that is defined as good by the Torah endows the person who performs it out of his virtuous choice and his concurring intellect<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Virtuous choice and his concurring intellect:</b> This means doing a mitzvah out of free will because of the understanding that it is the proper course of action and a desire to fulfill the will of Hashem by doing so.</i> with attachment to the treasury of life and goodness. For the person’s intellect will be cast in a manner similar to that of intellect inspired by Him [God], may He be blessed, to benefit from the light of His presence, may He be blessed. [Because of this,] the person becomes innately perfected and thereby worthy of being sustained by the luminescence of the universal light. This is because his ways correspond to the ways that He chose.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><b>The ways that He chose:</b> Because a person decided based on their own free will to attach themselves to the will of their Creator in both thought and deed, it is fitting that they will be able to receive the Divine abundance and blessing due to the now inherent connection between the person and Hashem.</i>
But if a person behaves corruptly, they impose on themselves a form that is cast in the opposite of perfect divine wisdom, which is the <i>summum bonum</i> (the highest good) that must be attained as it is the true <i>telos</i> (the full potential or inherent purpose/objective) of the world. They have harmed themselves, as the form of their soul is not cast in accordance with the truth of perfection but its opposite, in proportion to the sin. More so, the person suffers greatly from being banished, as it is impossible for them to be sustained by the luminescence of the divine light, for its taste is lost to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Its taste is lost to them</b>: A person who sins distances themselves and their soul from the Divine Presence. Therefore, they are no longer able to appreciate the Divine abundance and sustenance their soul needs. This is comparable to a person losing their appetite and no longer appreciating food while they suffer from a physical malady. Additionally, it is similar to what is written in the first chapter of <i>Mesillat Yesharim</i>. There the Ramchal explains that “the primary purpose of man's existence in this world is solely to fulfill the commandments, serve God and stand up to trials.” Therefore, a person’s soul will only be able to derive true pleasure by actions that draw it closer to its spiritual perfection.</i> Furthermore, it will be a source of great discontent, for everything is pained by its opposite. Pain, shame, and imperfection all converge here, as the person gazes at the splendor of wisdom and their face falls as they see that they cannot connect to it because they are blemished, and their soul will mourn for itself.
So sin is deficiency of the soul; the fear concerning avoidance of this is fear of sin; and the fear relating to being banished from the divine light and his shame and pain—this is fear of Heaven.
A person whom God, may He be exalted, graced with the wisdom to understand matters of divine service and with the purity of heart to walk before Him will find no satisfaction at all if he forsakes contemplation commensurate with his level.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Commensurate with his level:</b> Each and every person has their own path to <i>Avodat Hashem</i>; therefore, they have to approach this task according to the level they are at, as explained by Rav Kook in the introduction to this work.</i> He has no right to forsake it, for along with allocating the appropriate portion to the practical aspect of the Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the Talmud and Halachic Codes.</i> he must also understand that this is what is appropriate for him in accordance with the root of his soul.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the esoteric Kabbalistic elements of divine feeling and the deeper spiritual emotional capabilities of the person.</i> Therefore, when he forsakes [delving into these deeper matters of faith], reverence and the pleasure of rejoicing in the Lord will be denied to him because of his being endowed with [this additional] sanctity, unlike in the case of one who is not as capable [of delving into these matters, and therefore will not be troubled by their lacking].

Section 7

<b>G. The study of reverence and its establishment</b><br><small><i>In the following paragraphs, Rav Kook elaborates on the importance of the study of reverence and, like the Ramchal in his introduction to Mesilat Yesharim, offers an explanation as to why this important path of study is not as accepted as it should be. Additionally, Rav Kook cautions us regarding the superficial and solely emotional study of these topics. This caution places this section firmly into the historical context of the time of its writing, offering a subtle critique of the emotional and rapturous nature of study in the Mussar Movement.</i></small>
The reason that the study required for matters of divine service is not as widespread as it ought to be, despite the fact that it requires extensive study and much contemplation, is that the intellect is only interested in what it can comprehend, and there has been a decline in true knowledge.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Decline in true knowledge:</b> The Ramchal explains in <i>Mesillat Yesharim</i> that in his generation the lack of time devoted to the study of <i>Avodat Hashem</i> was due to the topic being “so familiar and so evident to them that they see no need for spending much time on it.” Rav Kook explains that for his time, even if one had a desire to study these topics, the declining intellect and spiritual comprehension of the generation need to be considered.</i> Granted, our earlier and later Rabbis bequeathed a blessing to us in their works concerning matters of divine service. However, some of them expressed themselves tersely such that they are inadequate for any of our generation to understand, except for perhaps the elite among them. Others spoke of such lofty matters that their words are like a sealed book for anyone who has not yet learned the ways of reverence and divine service, to the limited degree that the purity of human intellect can grasp.
There is a further reason [for the lack of intellectual involvement in matters of divine service]. The heart’s excitement and the enthusiasm of the soul are completely opposed to wisdom taking hold in man.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><b>To wisdom taking hold in man:</b> Learning with enthusiasm and excitement is not conducive to understanding new topics and ideas. For this type of study, one most take a more intellectual and analytical approach.</i> Although positive and holy enthusiasm is sometimes good, that is only true in terms of fixing knowledge that it has already acquired deeper into the soul. However, establishing knowledge and understanding in the first place requires total tranquility, and “a halachic discussion requires clarity like the day the north wind [<i>istena</i>] blows.”<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">[Tractate Megilla 28b.]</i> This is especially true of sacred matters that are sublime, such as the topic of perfect divine service, and “the time dedicated to learning the Torah and to prayer are independent of each other.”<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Independent of each other:</b> [Shabbat 10a.] This means that the time that one devotes to prayer (in this instance, emotional learning) is not at the expense of the time devoted to Torah study (intellectual learning) and that there is a time and place for both forms of learning.</i> True, it is appropriate, even obligatory, to preface<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><b>To preface:</b> As Rav Chaim of Volozhin writes in <i>Nefesh Hachaim</i>, Gate 4, Subsections 6–7, “whenever a person prepares himself to learn, it’s worthwhile for him to settle himself down before he begins, at least for a small amount of time, in pure fear/awe of God with a pure heart/mind, to cause himself to confess his sins from the depths of his heart/mind, so that his Torah should be holy and pure. And he should intend to attach himself to the Holy One (blessed be He) via his learning the Torah.” [See Vilna Gaon Mishlei, the end of Chapter 15; <i>Nefesh Hachaim</i> 4:6, 7.]</i> every study with repentance, faith, and simple reverence, and this is certainly true in the case of the study of reverence. However, the required arousal of the soul ought to be relegated to a separate time, prior or following, while the study itself is done in tranquil and calm joy, as our Sages of blessed memory instructed in the forty-eight methods of acquisition of the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Acquisition of the Torah:</b> It is written in <i>Pirkei Avot</i> 6:6 that the eighth way of acquiring Torah is through joy and the thirteenth is with clear thinking. Therefore, this joy is a moderated form of pleasure and happiness that complements clear thinking, not ecstatic exuberance that detracts from it.</i> And this refers to the joy of tranquility, which chases away all sorrow, based on the intellect’s discernment, with total faith in God and understanding His benevolence. Then he will succeed.
It is the nature of every sort of study to excite the soul’s capabilities [<i>kochot hanefesh</i>] to a certain degree. This is so [the necessity of intellectual and tranquil study] to an even greater degree in the case of the study of reverence and all the details of divine service, as the soul is naturally drawn to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Naturally drawn to them</b>: The Ramchal elaborates upon this in his introduction and first chapter of <i>Mesillat Yesharim</i>.</i> This causes one in whom the love of seeking the truth, which is the pursuit of the Lord, is not well established and who only studies these matters out of a sense of an obligation<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Sense of an obligation:</b> [See Sota 22b.] In Tractate Sota, the Talmud explains that there are seven pseudo-righteous people who erode the world, one of whom is “the righteous who say: Tell me what my obligation is and I will perform it.”</i> that he heard of to think that he has fulfilled his obligation if he finds that his heart is moved to joy in matters of love or fear in matters of reverence. As a result, he will be lax in pursuing the truth. <sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><b>In pursuing the truth:</b> Because the person is studying only out of a sense of obligation, they will think that with these small superficial and emotional feelings, they have come to the end of their journey of study of reverence and all of the details of divine service. This will dissuade them from continuing with an in-depth study of these topics.</i> This factor is compounded by the fact that these topics are treated very concisely in the works of the Sages, and ostensibly there is no need for in-depth study. Therefore, when such a person discovers some new feeling in his heart, he concludes that it is specifically this that is reverence.
However, this leads to a terrible evil and causes the name of the Lord, Who is the essence of a life of perfection, to be forgotten. For when the person’s excitement abates, they will find their soul empty and thereby, God forbid, denigrate the entire enterprise of reverence. At the very least he will abandon it in favor of other studies in which his intellect can excel in understanding and comprehension.
Therefore, there is a tremendous obligation on anyone whom the Lord has graced with understanding in the ways of reverence and the paths for acquiring it and learning its ways to explain the topic to the best of their ability and to teach the method of straightforward study in matters of perfect divine service so that even those of limited intellect can progress properly and correctly clarify concepts, understand, and even innovate ideas. As a result, the concepts will be acquired and established for them, for “Torah leads to care [<i>zehirut</i>].”<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Torah leads to care [<i>zehirut</i>]:</b> Only after a person has truly learned these topics in an intellectual and meaningful way will they come to possess the requisite knowledge necessary to be careful [<i>zehirut</i>] in matters of reverence and divine service. [Avoda Zara 20b. See also <i>Shir Hashirim Rabba</i>, Volume I.]</i>
In addition, students of the Torah in our time and place are accustomed to learning in the mode of ingenuity<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Mode of ingenuity:</b> This refers to the type of learning called “Pilpul”—loosely translated as “sharp analysis.” It is a method of studying the Talmud through intense textual analysis and casuistic argumentation in an attempt to either explain conceptual differences between various halakhic rulings or to reconcile any apparent contradictions presented in various readings of different texts.</i> such that their main pleasure in learning is contingent on their intellect having the opportunity to excel and innovate. This unfortunate tendency<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><b>This unfortunate tendency:</b> Many are the Rabbinic luminaries who take affront to focusing exclusively on this type of Torah study, most notably found in the works <i>Mesillat Yesharim</i>, <i>Chovat Halevavot</i>, <i>Sefer Gur Aryeh</i> of the Maharal of Prague, and the <i>Shelah HaKaddosh</i>.</i> [in learning] is very harmful and detrimental, as it results in the diminished study of areas of the Torah that do not lend themselves as much to in-depth analysis involving distinctions—for example, the laws of blessings and prayer. Nonetheless, it is difficult to uproot this tendency, especially since it is intrinsically very positive, as long as it is not taken too far. For the pursuit of truth requires preparing the mind to exert itself in contemplating deep issues.
Therefore, all those who are committed to the Torah of the Lord should be shown that the studies relating to reverence are the most intense in terms of intellectual exertion, even on a straightforward intellectual level, and that these studies improve the intellect and expand one’s knowledge, aside from their great innate benefits.

Section 8

<b>H. The study of reverence and the value of man [<i>madregat ha’adam</i>]—with joy and gladness [<i>tuv leivav</i>]</b>
The study of reverence [<i>yirah</i>] includes understanding what causes reverence to be burdensome for oneself.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Burdensome for oneself:</b> At first glance many people believe that a life of Torah, Mitzvot, reverence, and divine service are too much for them to accomplish. These people don’t negate the value of these ideals; rather, they feel that it is somehow outside of their grasp and feel burdened by their lack of success in these endeavors. Therefore, in order to counteract these feelings, one must understand its source in order to uproot it.</i>
The first requirement of divine service is that it be performed with joy and gladness [<i>tuv leivav</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Joy and gladness:</b> [Devarim 28:47. See further Shalah, Parshat Tavo; <i>Mesillat Yesharim</i>,<i></i> Chapter 19.]</i> Joy and gladness are apparently two independent things.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Two independent things:</b> As is explained in the concluding paragraphs of this section, <b>Joy</b> results from acquiring something new. A spiritual example, as explained in the upcoming paragraph, is the awareness of the enormous value of divine service that is way above a person’s spiritual level and yet is still possible to receive. <b>Gladness</b> results from an awareness of the love of Hashem for His creations and the greatness of the human soul.</i> It is possible for joy to exist without gladness, and then it is undesirable, and there is the possibility of gladness [<i>tuv leivav</i>] without joy.
Many have seen mention in books<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Mention in books:</b> For example, see Sharei Teshuva 4:9; <i>Orchot Tzadikim</i>, “The Gate of Happiness”; <i>Mesillat Yesharim</i>,<i></i> Chapter 19.</i> of the obligation for divine service, learning the Torah, and prayer to be performed with joy [and therefore, they force themselves to develop feelings of joy because of this obligation]. However, they do not perceive with their mind that they need to gradually perfect themselves<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><b> Gradually perfect themselves:</b> Forcing oneself to develop joy without the prerequisite understanding and preparations turns those feelings that do develop artificial and fleeting. Therefore, the person will not be able to identify with them in the long run.</i> so that they eventually become fit for experiencing joy in Torah learning, prayer, and all forms of service of the Lord, may He be blessed. Therefore, even when this joy enters their heart, [because they have not properly perfected themselves] they will not experience happiness. For they do not truly desire this joy, nor is it acceptable to them. Rather, they experience this “joy” as a sense of obligation [and therefore, they experience joy but not gladness—<i>tuv leivav</i>].
It is also possible for an individual to be glad [<i>tuv leivav</i>] about their divine service, as they recognize that it is appropriate to serve the Master of the universe, may He be blessed, and that it is appropriate for them to serve Him, since they are His creations whom He graced with knowledge and understanding in order to serve Him. Yet, they may not recognize the greatness of the divine service<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Greatness of the divine service:</b> This is explained at the beginning of the chapter regarding the difficulty of truly understanding divine service.</i>
—which [even though this service] innately surpasses their [currently known spiritual] level yet is suitable for them [once properly understood]—and that they should certainly be happy about the fact that it innately surpasses their level and yet is good for them, as they are happy to receive something new that is good.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Something new that is good:</b> In this case, not the happiness of attaining a new physical object but rather the happiness of receiving new spiritual insights and understanding.</i> For since the individual did not have this goodness before, it was out of their reach. And when they suddenly receive this goodness, they rejoice. But once it has been acquired, and they are accustomed to it, then there is no longer any cause for joy [and therefore the person experiences gladness (<i>tuv leivav</i>) but not continued joy]. Therefore, when there is something [i.e., <i>yirahat Hashem</i>] that always surpasses our level and is good for us, then it is cause for constant joy, regardless of how old it is.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Regardless of how old it is:</b> In this case of <i>yirahat Hashem</i>, the person is constantly discovering new insights; therefore, their spiritual journey will not remain stagnant.</i> This is the meaning of “you should view them as new every day.”<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">[Rashi Devarim 26:16.]</i> [Similarly,] so that joy should also be felt in physical matters, the Creator instilled in humanity the ability to innovate new ideas so that there would be joy in the physical world as well. However, when the physical is elevated, there will be constant joy commensurate with the constancy of the wholly perfect comprehension.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Wholly perfect comprehension</b>: The world progresses toward the messianic age, and the mundane and physical is uplifted by the spiritual; therefore, even in these “mundane matters,” a person will find spiritual joy.</i>
In any case, joy results from an awareness of the enormous value of divine service, that it is way above a person’s spiritual level. And gladness—from the knowledge that they ought to engage in divine service out of an awareness of the love of the Master, may He be blessed, for His creations, especially the nation close to Him.
[After the above explanation] Therefore, there are two lessons [needed to allow a person to experience divine service and reverence (<i>yirah</i>), with joy and gladness]:
A. [To recognize] the exalted level of all divine service, as it literally brings one closer to his Creator, may He be blessed.
B. [To understand] the value of the human soul and its intrinsic spirituality such that despite being befouled by all manner of materialistic filth, God forbid, nonetheless, “If a myrtle is found among thorns, its name is still ‘myrtle,’ and people call it a myrtle.”<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">[Sanhedrin 44a.] And therefore, no person is too far removed from their divine soul to begin the study of these topics with the proper preparation.</i> [And so too does the soul] retain its innate radiance, and as a result of this very awareness, it is truly purified. For this is a major branch of the branches of repentance motivated by love [<i>teshuva meahavah</i>].
These lessons should be organized and clear to every individual and rehearsed in their mouth and heart [and therefore will reach the full spectrum of <i>Avodat Hashem</i>].

The saint stipulated a major condition for the soul in <i>Chovot Halevavot</i> (Duties of the Heart),<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Bachaya ibn Paquda.</i> namely, that it [the soul and the person] be willing to tolerate the medicine’s bitterness.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Tolerate the medicine’s bitterness:</b> This means that a person must recognize that if they wish to elevate their <i>Avodat Hashem</i>, they must be open and willing to accept the challenges that will await them as part of their journey, similar to the way that many medicines have a negative taste but offer positive results.</i> This is extremely necessary, for so long as a person says to themselves that the only path [to elevate their <i>Avodat Hashem</i>] is that of tranquility, that they will only walk comfortably on the paved path, they are in imminent danger of stumbling.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Danger of stumbling:</b> It is clear from their actions that they do not take this journey of character development seriously if they are only willing to take the “easy” way toward their goal.</i> For it is more likely that they [are simply not genuinely concerned] about leaving the path of evil than it is that they immediately comprehend and recognize the path of good that will protect them. However, once one is willing and prepared to bear the bitterness of the medicine, it need not necessarily be bitter.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><b>It need not necessarily be bitter:</b> This means that once a person has taken it upon themselves to genuinely embark on a path of character development and <i>Avodat Hashem</i> and is willing to be challenged, this challenge does not necessarily have to be a bitter one.</i> For there are many medicines that are sweet, or at least not so bitter. Besides, the medicine is sweetened for one who is accepting of it, due to their love for health.
Nonetheless, the rule is that people find change difficult and unpleasant. This is also true for physical matters involving difficult actions requiring one to move one’s limbs. [However] If an individual trains themselves to [habitually] do such an action, it will then be difficult for them to refrain from it. This is even truer for mental activities that are a mere flash,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Are a mere flash:</b> [See Iyyov 5:7, Vilna Gaon, ad loc.]</i> moving swiftly and accustomed to always being in line with coarse imagination about attaining materials and means of enjoying them in terms of that which is physically pleasurable and love of honor and pride and other such corrupt paths. For if the mind’s thoughts connect with the nature of the body without being ordered by wisdom, which gives life to one who possesses it, they will certainly produce thorns and thistles.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Certainly produce thorns and thistles:</b> If a person’s thoughts and imaginings are not grounded in fear of Heaven, they will by their very definition lead a person astray due to the ease with which they can be turned only toward physical pleasures and activities.</i>
There are two components to the study of perfect divine service, which encompasses the perfecting of all actions and traits along with the proper organization of the perfect, magnificent conduct that the Creator, blessed is He, desires.
The first component is almost entirely dependent on intellect [<i>sechel</i>] alone. It is the attainment of wisdom and knowledge of the virtues [<i>middot</i>], what they involve, their attributes and boundaries, the application of their capabilities, and how to utilize each capability and virtue.
But in addition to this knowledge, there is the aspect of divine service that follows [this basic understanding]. For even if one grasps the ways of proper conduct at first glance, the individual remains distant from it because they have not yet properly trained their will [<i>ratzon</i>] and the capabilities [<i>kochot hanefesh</i>] that reside in their body<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><b>That reside in their body:</b> [See <i>Chovot Halevavot,</i> in the section titled “Concentration of action,” Chapter 5, as well as Chapter 9.] It means that even once a person knows what the proper path is, they still have to develop within themselves the desire and ability to follow that path.</i> to all wholeheartedly concur with that goodness. Therefore, the person must settle their mind and calm their attributes and try to distance themselves from anything that confounds their attributes and causes them to be out of control or overexcited, as this undermines the entire foundation of the soul.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Foundation of the soul:</b> Since the first step in embarking on a path of divine service is intellectual study and observation, it is imperative to make sure that one has full and calm control over their intellect, without any external distractions.</i>
With respect to all of these, the individual should train themselves with a strong perspective and true wisdom, using their intellect to discern the means for self-improvement in a way that is suitable for their temperament.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><b>For their temperament:</b> Therefore, they can take what they have theoretically learned and studied with their intellect and put it into concrete practice and action, fitting to their own personal needs.</i> For sometimes a person needs to train and strengthen their attributes to be able to retain their sanctity and purity even when they are interacting with other people and involved with the ways of the world. All this should be done for the sake of the Lord and His might.
The practical will [<i>ratzon</i>] of a person is guided by the intellect [<i>sechel</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This means that motivation for practical action is driven by intellectual aspirations.</i> Nonetheless, if a person has a desire for good to begin with, or if they trained themselves to act properly through the counsel of the Sages, then their actions will be good and of extremely great value, capable of engendering salvation and renown.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Engendering salvation and renown:</b> Through sheer force of positive will, a person has the possibility to make great spiritual changes, even if their intellect has not yet reached complete spiritual perfection. [See Yishayahu 60:18 and Chapters 61–62.]</i> However, if the capability of the intellect was the starting point, without any of this [the innate desire for good or training], even though a person’s perspective is good and desirable, they will still be far from the path of well-considered actions, except with great effort and as a monkey-like action.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Monkey-like action:</b> This means that although a person is performing the proper actions, they are doing so simply by rote, like a monkey who mimics a person. Even though these actions are being performed, they are spiritually lacking in the sense that the person’s will [<i>ratzon</i>] does not personally identify with those acts.</i>
This is alluded to by the words of the Sages,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Words of the Sages:</b> [Berachot 60a.] According to the explanation by Rabbi Shlomo Aviner, Rav Kook uses the terms man and wife to reflect the ideas of the intellect (man) and character development and good intentions (wife; see <i>Pirush of Rav Aviner to Mussar Avicha</i>, pg. 132). Additionally, the concept of <i>yoledet</i> refers to “birthing” good deeds (Rabbi Chagi London’s <i>Pirush to Mussar Avicha</i>, pg. 97).</i> “If the man emits seed first, his wife gives birth [<i>yoledet</i>] to a female; if the woman emits seed first, she gives birth [<i>yoled</i>] to a male.” For if the actions, which are called <i>toladot</i>, are exclusively a product of the intellect, without being based on perfection of one’s attributes, they are weak like a female and are transient. But if they are a product of perfection of one’s attributes through proper education and intensive training, like a wife who is under the husband’s influence, they are strong and have a solid foundation.
<small><i>After explaining the necessity of perfecting one’s character traits as well as their intellect, the next paragraphs delineate the way in which a person can begin this process of self-correction and improvement.</i></small><br>The matter of self-correction [<i>tikkun</i>] is accessible, in one’s heart and mouth, as the verse states, “For the matter is very close to you, in your mouth and in your heart, to do it,”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 30:14.</i> that is, [that the matter of <i>tikkun</i> can be accomplished] through a person’s intellect and will. For in truth, a person’s intellect and will derive from the purity of the sacred soul, and they are its portion and birthright. But once the intellect and will act [namely, emerge from the realm of thought and enter the realm of physical deed], they pave the paths of their actions and tendencies throughout all the pathways of the body, through all of its arteries and tendons in the depth of its nature.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Depth of its nature:</b> In their natural state, the intellect and will are pure inasmuch as they are the manifestation of the soul. This understanding, when properly internalized, will also channel the purity of the intellect and will into physical deeds and actions.</i>
For the intellect and will also act upon the physical and its components in conjunction with the habituation [of the person] and the suitability of [their] nature. [Therefore], the intellect and will, which are essentially the cause of [all human] actions, are implicated in the action of devastation and waywardness.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Devastation and waywardness:</b> However, once used by a person in a negative way, the intellect and will can become corrupted and depart from their earlier spiritual statues. This is what was mentioned earlier, in the section “Sin stupefies [<i>metamtemet</i>].”</i> However, this is not innate; rather, it is due to their union with the physical and due to a lack of thought regarding their path. It is for this reason that the physical, whose nature is to go forth unguided and unthinking, is thereby strengthened and reaches fruition. But the intellect and will, whose accomplishment is contingent on their ability to deliberate their path, are weakened by the lack of this act [of planned action] that they require. Therefore, they are dominated by the nature of the physical, despite being much more powerful.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Much more powerful:</b> The intellect and will are a much more powerful force than the base desires and needs of the body. However, they can sometimes be swept away by the headlong rush of physical gratifications.</i> But since their loss is merely accidental, it is easily corrected by taking his soul to heart, “and he can call back His spirit and breath to him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Iyyov 34:14.</i>
The concept of “calling back to him” is that the soul, having paved its path through the entire body, is truly dispersed throughout all parts of the body as it exerts its dominion over it. And since all the parts of the body have been corrupted, it is corrupted as well when it flows over them. However, it is possible for a person to insert the dispersing lines into their points.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Dispersing lines into their points:</b> Picture the following: The soul as the veins of a person, starting from the head and then spreading downwards through the body. After spreading, they have become corrupted by the base nature of the person. Therefore, to correct and repair them, they must be drawn back upwards to the head, as was mentioned in the verse, “and he can call back His spirit.”</i> This is a tremendous burden and very bitter [for them]. For freedom and diffusion is suitable and appropriate for the soul [as a boundless spiritual entity], as even the entire body, including all its parts, is a tremendous confinement for it, especially if the constriction is intensified by it only being allowed to disperse under specific conditions.
When he inserts the dispersed lines into the points of the intellect and the will, which are innately pure, these lines that have habituated to a non-sacred path will not be pleased with this constricted placement.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Not be pleased with this constricted placement:</b> The capacity of the human soul, its creativity, and its innovation are endless. Therefore, when a person begins the process of reining in their desires, which previously ran unchecked, their soul will feel stifled.</i> Therefore, when he first starts on his path, he will be dejected due to this pressure. But if, God forbid, the individual capabilities escape their points to go where they will, then they will become even more corrupt, for all the stumbling blocks are already set up, and there are no proper systems that have been set up in the depths of the physical.
However, after a short while the lines will be restored to their nature, and they will rejoice at their return to their maternal home and their parents’ room from a distant land. His pain, sense of inferiority and depression will then be eased. But he will still feel distress, as he is still unable to let the capabilities of his soul loose to wander unrestricted, as the land has still not dried up from the iniquitous waters that flow over it.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><b>That flow over it:</b> After the initial “ingathering” of the dispersed aspects of the soul in the body, there is some relief. However, until a person has rid themselves completely of their negative traits, they must constantly keep their desires, both spiritual and physical, in check.</i> Therefore, he must still rein in his thoughts to shield them from evil.
But after a short while, his mental capacities will become accustomed to proper conduct. They will reach out from their confinement to govern the behavior of the physical, causing it to also become accustomed to upright ways, and every part of him, including his spirit, will be a suitable vessel for the Lord’s will. Then his capabilities will be freed from the points in which they were confined to extend their dominion over the body. They will obey the guidance of the sacred intellect and run without stumbling.
<small> <i>This section compares the confined and restricted nature of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai’s assembly of Kabbalistic scholars to that of the restrictive and confined nature of Noah’s Ark. In the Ark, for humanity and nature to be saved, they had to be confined until the time was right for their departure. Similarly, the Kabbalistic teachings of Tikkun can only be spread widely at the right time. With this in mind, Rav Kook returns to the individual and explains that in character development, there is a need to first place restricting measures on the soul, which will eventually lead to its full spiritual “liberation.”</i></small><br>The specific instance [of individual<i> tikkun</i>, as mentioned above] concerning man is derived from the universal principle that the saintly Rabbi Moshe Chasim Luzzatto of blessed memory taught us [in his commentary on the <i>Idra Rabba<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Idra Rabba (Zohar 3:127b–145a): In this work, which is part of the Zohar, Rav Shimon bar Yochai convenes with nine other scholars, and they gather in the sacred <i>Idra</i>—threshing floor in Aramaic—where they “thrash out” Kabbalistic teachings. The Ramchal’s comments appear in his work <i>Adir Bamarom</i>, page 7.</i> </i>] with respect to the deluge and Noah’s Ark, which the assembly of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, peace be upon him, resembled. The rehabilitations [Kabbalistic <i>tikunim</i> of the world] were accomplished within [Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai’s] assembly, just as the entire world was rehabilitated by means of raising the living creatures and providing them with food within the Ark. It was not possible to spread throughout the world because the attribute of justice [<i>midat hadin</i>] caused there to be a deluge over the surface of the Earth in order to eradicate iniquity and put an end to transgression. Similarly, the great rehabilitations of the sacred luminaries could not spread throughout the world due to the foolishness of mankind caused by the filth of evil actions and desires of the imagination. But once the world is perfected, they will go free from their confinement. So too, once the body is perfected, those capabilities will go free.
The Holy One, blessed be He, created man wisely and instilled capabilities for repentance in his nature, since repentance preceded the creation of the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Preceded the creation of the world:</b> This is explained in Tanna Debe Eliyahu Rabbah 31. See also Midrash Tehillim 90 as well as Midrash Tanchuma Parshat Naso Siman 11.</i> Therefore, man can control his mind and contain his capabilities within it. However, this containment [which is necessary before a person has perfected their character traits] is experienced as sadness in the heart and as stress and irritation in the intellect. But this is not the telos [inherent purpose]. Rather, in the course of rehabilitation, a person must experiment with his capabilities and see if they can be set free to serve the Lord, may He be blessed, with greater vigor. For Torah study can only be broadened and reach the depths of true wisdom and accomplish good and right, great achievements by means of a soul full of courage and a spirit of courage to walk unfettered in open spaces. This is the concept of sending out the raven and the dove, that is, that a person finds within himself ways by which to try out his capabilities in a way where there is no threat of loss or danger. This is like Noah, who sent out birds whose wings protected them from the deluge, and when he saw that the corruption had not been completely corrected, he gathered them into his Ark until he knew that the surface of the earth was dry. He then introspected extensively, until he found that it was appropriate to release them, for the glory of the Lord, may He be blessed, and for the fulfillment of His Torah. This is along the lines of what the Lord, may He be blessed, said to Noah, namely, to leave the Ark.

Section 2

<b>B. In all your ways [<i>derachecha</i>] know Him [<i>da’ehu</i>]</b>
“In all your ways know Him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 3:6.</i> A person must seek the Lord, may He be blessed, within whatever path [<i>derech</i>] they are occupied with.
When involved in prayer, you should seek the Lord, may He be blessed, through understanding the concepts of prayer and proper intention concerning faith in those concepts of prayer. You should not seek knowledge of other matters at that time. Since you are engaged in this divine service, as far as you are concerned, the Holy One, blessed be He, dwells, so to speak, specifically within this service, and it is there that He will be found, and nowhere else.
When you are occupied with Torah study, you must realize that you will find the Holy One, blessed be He, when delving into the Torah and studying it in order to understand the topic clearly and to remember it and review it well. It is specifically in this way that you will know Him, may He be blessed, through His Torah, not in any other manner, since at this time He is revealed through this service.
So too, when you are involved in acts of kindness [<i>gemilut Chasadim</i>], to help another, you should seek the Holy One, blessed be He, exclusively by figuring out how to best benefit that person in a way that is fitting and lasting.
And so too in terms of whatever you do. In truth, there is nothing in the world that is not for His glory, may He be blessed. Therefore, everything that one does concerns His commandment and will, and you should seek His name, may He be blessed, trying with all your intellect and capabilities to do whatever you do with the utmost perfection in every sense. Then you will thereby know the Lord, may He be blessed, in all [<i>b’chol</i>] ways.
The <i>bet</i> [of <i>b’chol</i>] is used in the sense of “through,” meaning that by means of all ways you know the Holy One, blessed be He.
For this reason, it is “a brief passage.”<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><b>A brief passage:</b> [Berachot 63a.] Bar Kappara taught: Which is a brief passage upon which all aspects of the Torah are contingent? “In all your ways know Him, and He will direct your paths” (Proverbs 3:6).</i> For its commandment does not entail expansiveness and broadening of wisdom and thought. On the contrary, it demands restricting one’s focus to the matter that you are engaged in exclusively. Nonetheless, “all aspects of the Torah are contingent on it,” because you will thereby do everything properly, and the glory of the Holy One, blessed be He, will be complete. Our Sages alluded to this when they said, “The time dedicated to learning the Torah and to prayer are independent of each other.”<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbat 10a.</i> Understand this.

Section 3

<b>C. The power of gratitude [<i>hakarat hatov</i>] and the virtues of divine service out of love [<i>avoda meahava</i>]</b>
The foundation of the rehabilitation [<i>tikkun</i>] of divine service is setting up every element and every capability, whether in one’s soul or in the world, correctly and to not disrupt their organization, thereby thwarting the impact of their capabilities.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Impact of their capabilities:</b> Every spiritual and emotional resource has its own unique place and role to play in the betterment of the individual as well as humanity at large. In order to reach their full potential, these aspects must be set up properly in the thoughts and actions of mankind.</i>
God made man and the world straight, with the full complement of capabilities and means needed for the perfection of body and soul, to actualize their potential, to improve and succeed.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><b> To improve and succeed:</b> See the first chapter of <i>Mesillat Yesharim</i>, where the Ramchal elaborates on this at length.</i> A person who nullifies the organization that flows from His governance of the world, may He be blessed, brings about destruction. [As an example,] a person who abuses their body by restricting its necessary movement—for example, if they constantly lie folded up like a notebook without moving from their place and not moving the limbs [of the body]—will surely eliminate their bodily function. Similarly, a person who denies their soul its necessary movement<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Necessary movement:</b> This refers to spiritual expression, manifestation of character traits, and attributes in the service of God.</i> abuses its nature and thereby ruins it. The damage caused by restricting a movement is proportional to the importance of the action and its proper strength, as dictated by perfect recognition [of the Torah]. The entire Torah is also based on the secret of the soul’s qualities acting in accordance with the Creator’s knowledge of its nature, as is appropriate for it according to true wisdom.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><b>True wisdom</b>: The damage done by restricting the soul’s expression is commensurate to the spiritual value or spiritual action that has been negated. Furthermore, the Torah is a blueprint by which the capacities of the soul are to be judged.</i>
[The feeling and emotion of] gratitude is a powerful capability of the soul. The purer it is, the more the soul will yearn to actualize it, and to the degree that a person is wise, they will be affected by it. This movement [of gratitude] is one of the most important movements of the soul, being rooted in a principle corresponding to the perfection of existence dictated by the truth of the ultimate wisdom. The greater the good [that an individual receives] and the longer its duration, and the greater the gap between the recipient and the patron due to the exalted nature of the benefactor, the greater the sense of gratitude will be [on the part of the recipient of the gift].
[Therefore], the general perfection of existence [of that which is in the world], as dictated by the truth of [God’s] ultimate wisdom, demands perfect service [on the part of humanity] to the true Benefactor, blessed is He, by virtue of the rule of gratitude, to do that which is good and proper in the eyes of the Lord, and in accordance with His governance concerning the actions of His creatures. That which is good, following in His ways [studying the Torah and the performance of mitzvot], will please a person, and they will consider evil those [ideas and actions] that conflict with God’s sacred will, based on the system of the sanctity of the worlds and the antithesis of sanctity that they comprise,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><b> Which they comprise:</b> In truth, all that is created in existence—both good and evil, positive and negative—emanate from the Divine will. However, when contemplating the existence of evil, a person can only see the Divine will and goodness in an indirect manner.</i> such that gratitude serves as a truly beneficial force. For He, so to speak, chose to desire it.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Chose to desire it:</b> God desires, as it were, that a person be given the free will to choose to follow the path of good and depart from the path of evil.</i> The greatness of the rehabilitation [<i>tikkun</i>] and the service [of God and the fulfillment of the mitzvot] resulting from following in the path of goodness in order to express gratitude for the Benefactor, blessed is He, is commensurate with the perfection of the One who set up everything and the greatness of His will.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Greatness of His will:</b> Just as God is infinitely beyond the comprehension of the human mind, so too is the nature of comprehending the gratitude that we must have for God and His goodness toward us.</i>
[Therefore,] we are certainly incapable of imagining even partially the enormity of the powerful actions [needed to be taken] that ought to result from gratitude for His beneficence, may He be blessed. We must train ourselves in this light gradually, so that our soul not be weakened by its brilliance—and there is no limit to the weakness that will afflict the soul if the individual denies that which this true principle demands in terms of the Lord’s true actions.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Lord’s true actions:</b> The innermost parts of our soul recognize the depth of gratitude that is owed to God. However, we must proceed cautiously in our exploration of this feeling lest we become swept away by the magnitude of the task at hand. Similarly, by stubbornly denying the necessity for gratitude, our soul will become spiritually weakened when unable to express its true feelings and nature.</i>
Therefore, it is a fundamental principle that an individual should train themselves in the way of divine service out of love emanating from gratitude for God’s beneficence toward them. Although there are many greater and more outstanding paths of divine service out of love,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><b> Divine service out of love:</b> This refers to love of God’s exalted nature, as will be explained in the next section. Additionally, see <i>Chovot Halevavot</i> Section 10, “The Gate of Love of God,” where this point is elaborated on at length.</i> nonetheless it is impossible to avoid this one, and the paths [toward love of God, based upon gratitude] are good.
Indeed, this is also included in the principle of “establishing a set place for his prayer,”<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><b>For his prayer:</b> [See Berachot 6a.]</i> as the meaning of ‘a place’ is a fixed level and station. <sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><b>A fixed level and station:</b> A person’s perception of and motivation for divine service are based upon their current spiritual level and understanding. What motivates one person will not necessarily motivate another, and the inner intent of fulfillment of Mitzvot will differ from person to person. [See Maimonides, <i>The Guide for the Perplexed</i>, Section I:8; Rabbi Moshe Cordovero [Rama”k], <i>Shiur Komah</i>, Chapter 20.]</i> It is true that divine service, and particularly service of the heart [<i>avoda shebilev</i>] (prayer), in terms of recognition of God’s greatness and His exalted glory, that He is the true good, cannot reach its perfection by defining a [fixed] level. On the contrary, the more a person increases his knowledge, the more he will discern further levels [of understanding of Divine service]. However, prayer is called “transient life,”<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Transient life:</b> As per the Talmud in Tractate (Shabbat 10a). On the one hand, prayer is “fixed,” based on a person’s current spiritual level. On the other hand, however, it is “transient,” as the original “fixed” level can be replaced when the person reaches new spiritual heights. Similarly, gratitude is “fixed” as well as “transient,” based on the person’s current spiritual understanding of the gratitude he owes to God.</i> and its purpose is also to fulfill the obligation of divine service out of gratitude. For this reason, one should not receive any tangible benefit before praying, as [our Sages] of blessed memory<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Berachot 10b.</i> derived from “You shall not eat anything with its blood”<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Vayikra 19:26.</i> and “You have cast Me behind your back.”<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Berachot 10a; Melachim I, 14:9.</i> Therefore, its level is specific to each individual according to the degree of benefit that they have received from the benevolent God. This divine service [of prayer] is a function of benevolence [<i>hesed</i>], as is explained in <i>Reishit Chochmah</i> in the section on love, Chapter 5. Therefore, [it is written in the Talmud] “The God of Avraham assists him,”<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><b>The God of Avraham assists him:</b> Both this quote and the following one refer to a person who sets a “fixed” place for his prayers [Berachot 6b].</i> and it is said about the person, “Where is the humble one, where is the pious one [<i>chasid</i>]?”<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
This teaches us that the virtue of piety [<i>chasidut</i>] is not limited to divine service out of love of the highest level, that is, where a person is drawn to God like iron to a magnet, irresistibly, because of their wisdom through which they recognize His greatness. Rather, even in the case of divine service out of love emanating from gratitude, they are also considered pious people. This is especially true because the individual will ultimately attain the great love, which is not contingent on receiving benefit, as there is no greater benefit than His great name, and what good can be compared to it?
This is what is meant by “Where is the humble one?” because the person didn’t have the arrogance to say that this level was beneath them. For a person needs to always know that regardless of their greatness, the Creator will never find them worthy, because “He puts no trust in His holy ones.”<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><b>He puts no trust in His holy ones</b>: [Iyyov, Chapther 15; Tractate Chagigah 5b.] A person should always find the path of <i>Avodat Hashem</i> that is best suited to their present spiritual level. Realize that in truth, it is only through God’s love for us that we are able to draw close to Him and not because of the merit of our deeds.</i> Therefore, a person should always be humble and attempt to also acquire the virtue of love based on the great beneficence of the Creator, blessed is He, toward them. This is a simpler and more accessible venue for him. From there, one should ascend to the lofty level of the virtue of great love based on a recognition of God’s exaltedness, may He be blessed. The individual will thereby be lowly in their own eyes, having to constantly consider how all that they have, and their very existence, is merely the result of the profusion of benevolence from the benevolent God, blessed is He.
For this reason, the Torah is referred to as the great love, which is eternal life, based on His greatness and wisdom,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Greatness and wisdom</b>: As opposed to prayer, which (as explained above) is based on the current spiritual level of the person, the Torah is a constant level of wisdom and therefore eternal and never changing.</i> and prayer is referred to as transient life, based on His benevolence and kindnesses.

Section 4

<b>D. Perfection of<i></i> divine service out of love, solely to fulfill the will of the Lord [<i>retzon Hashem</i>]</b>
In the beginning of his work <i>Mesilat Yesharim</i>, the saint wrote that the foundation of piety and the root of perfect divine service is for a person to clarify and verify what their obligation in this world is and what they should strive for in all of their efforts, all the days of their life.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mesillat Yesharim</i>, Chapter 1.</i> He [Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto] indicated two fundamental principles here, which he clarified in his essay “Derech chochmah<i>”</i> (The path of wisdom).
[The first principle is that] Our obligation consists of all good actions and virtues, all correct beliefs, and, most of all, correct perception, within human capabilities, of the perfection of God and His righteous ways and conduct by which He runs His creation.
[The second principle is that] The entire goal of these good actions will only reach fruition through purity of intention.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Purity of intention:</b> This refers to the correct and proper reason to serve God, namely, to fulfill the commandments for the purpose of giving our Creator satisfaction—<i>Nachat Ruach</i>.</i> In the case of a person studying and investigating divine matters as well, if it is only for the purpose of quenching the soul’s intellectual thirst to know great things, it will not reach fruition; the goal must be to give the Creator satisfaction, as He, may He be blessed, commanded us out of His kindness and compassion, to perfect ourselves in terms of this great perfection, attaining knowledge of Him, may He be blessed. This is the meaning of the perspective and inner goal mentioned here.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Inner goal mentioned here</b>: This refers to the first chapter of <i>Mesillat Yesharim</i>, regarding the purpose of man in the world.</i>
It is fitting to explain the concepts of “divine service out of love” and “for the purpose of giving their Creator satisfaction” such that even those of limited intellect, as myself, can understand. For many [people] will be unable to descend to the depths of the matter, how love for any perfection is possible, unless it is in terms of the one achieving it themselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><b>One achieving it themself:</b> If the correct intent of fulfilling the mitzvot and <i>Avodat Hashem</i> is giving our Creator satisfaction—<i>Nachat Ruach</i>—then seemingly this perfection is more dependent on God, as it were, and not people themselves.</i>
True, everyone understands that it is impossible for a person to fully comprehend what true perfection and true benefit are. For it is possible for the Lord, may He be blessed, to perform incredible benevolences and equip the soul to receive them in ways that are incomprehensible. Therefore, it behooves us to always choose to act in accordance with the true perfection that God knows to be the select perfection. But if we act based on what we imagine or perceive, we will certainly fall short. When we were in our mother’s womb, or even when we were nursing or as older individuals, we were unable to perceive the value of the many benevolences that the gracious and merciful One intended for us now as a bequest from the Lord, such as children and all of our possessions, and especially the pleasantness of wisdom, the satisfaction of doing good and kindness, and the capacity for these things. Similarly, we cannot imagine the enormity of the good that He will bestow on us if we follow in His ways, for our welfare, as promised to us by nearly all the prophets and our Sages, of blessed memory, common sense clearly bringing us to the same conclusion.
But the question is ostensibly the following: No matter how much we amplify and glorify the great good [that God bestows upon us], in the final analysis, how can one [not but] be motivated by [the idea that it is a positive benefit for themselves to serve God for the purpose of giving their Creator satisfaction]?<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Giving their Creator satisfaction</b>: Therefore, is a person ever really serving God out of love, without any personal benefit for themselves?</i> This being the case, why did our Sages, of blessed memory, denigrate one who serves in order to receive a reward?<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">[See <i>Pirkei Avot</i> 1:3.]</i> Furthermore, they said, “And greatly desires His commandments—His commandments, and not their reward.”<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">[Tractate Avoda Zara 19a.]</i> And in the holy Zohar<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">[<i>Tikunim</i>, 30. “And there: All kindness (<i>chesed</i>) that they perform”. In the Targum on the Torah, <i>chesed</i> is translated as “good.” So too in the <i>Tanya</i>, <i>Likutei Amarim</i>, end of Chapter 1: “The good that they do”.]</i> it says that it is a grave stigma that all that they do is only for their own benefit. Our Kabbalistic Rabbis, who are privy to the Lord’s secrets, also expounded in a similar vein.
However, once we consider it a bit, we will realize that the intellect can only attain perfection in conjunction with righteousness [<i>yosher</i>]. Intellect together with righteousness is the perfection of the soul, just as life together with all its needs is the perfection of the body. It would appear that it is not at all fitting for any intelligent person to serve the Lord other than out of love and in order to give their Creator satisfaction by fulfilling His sacred will. Even though this itself is His will, namely, for humanity to attain this extremely great and glorious perfection, nonetheless one’s actions should be directed exclusively toward the goal of fulfilling His will.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Fulfilling His will:</b> Even though by fulfilling the will of Hashem humanity achieves perfection, the impetus and desire to perform His will should be to give our Creator satisfaction and not for the perfection that we receive because of it.</i>
Let’s take the case of a man who has a good heart and loves justice and kindness. Suppose they once have the opportunity to save an entire country with a population of myriads of people from a disaster that is going to befall them—for example, the individual realizes that in a number of days there is going to be a tragic earthquake in that region, which will obliterate the population. They warn them, saving them by allowing them to flee to a safe and tranquil place. Consequently, a certain person hears about this great act of kindness that has been performed and sends the individual a thousand silver shekels as a gift. If the first person’s joy over the thousand shekels of silver exceeds his joy over saving that entire population, it would be a tremendous baseness and inferiority of the soul and a lack of perfection, such that any intelligent person ought to bemoan their inferiority.
If we carefully examine the root of this inferiority and the reason for deciding that this tendency is inferiority, we will realize that it is due to the value we place on human life, the preciousness of each life, and our adding up in our minds all the collective good and value of the numerous lives. As a result, we disdain the trivial good of a thousand shekels of silver in comparison.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><b>In comparison:</b> By using the phrase “in comparison,” Rav Kook seems to suggest that the inferiority of happiness in receiving the monetary reward is only when it outweighs the happiness of doing the actual good deed. However, in and of itself there is no issue with being happy when receiving a “side benefit” from this moral action.</i> If this recipient had a proper perspective, this trivial good wouldn’t be valued at all by them in comparison to the enormous good that they did. All of this is because of the perceivable honor and value of tens of thousands of people.
Now let us calculate in the case of the Creator, may He be blessed, and His glory, which is infinite. Granted, we have no concept of how to imagine such a calculation. Nonetheless, we know that all the honor and lofty value of all of existence, from highest to lowest, all derive from His incomparable glory and perfection. And we know clearly that His will is vastly more precious and immeasurably and incomparably more glorious than all the preciousness, honor and perfection in all of existence. Therefore, does it make sense to be concerned or to think about the gain or perfection that the person themselves receives and by means of which their personal will is fulfilled, when they know that as a result of attaining perfection for themselves (and for all creatures, as is known from the Lord’s secret, possessed by those who fear Him), they are thereby doing the will of the Creator? For that is more significant and precious than all the creatures themselves, together with all of their dignity and precious glory. For everything is His, and all that they possess is from His hand, may He be blessed. Therefore, it is certain that once this truth becomes clear to the individual, it will be impossible, in terms of that which is reasonable and right, for them to tolerate any motivation whatsoever other than that of giving their Creator satisfaction.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><b> Their Creator satisfaction:</b> As in the parable of saving lives and then receiving a monetary reward, so too is it in the spiritual realm of serving Hashem. Once a person understands the significance of doing the will of Hashem, that will eclipse any other benefit that a person might receive.</i>
Based on this, we can understand the tremendous wisdom and perfection to which our Sages, of blessed memory, guided us in their advice and admonition, “Do not be like servants who serve the master in the expectation of receiving a reward, but be like servants who serve the master without the expectation of receiving a reward.”<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirkei Avot 1:3</i></i>. It specifically mentions servants rather than children to rule out even the fulfillment of the natural inclination of a holy soul thirsting for the Lord and His holy word.
Even if we are incapable of understanding this precisely, nonetheless, by means of connections perceived through perfect faith and through general understanding refined by means of divine service, we can be enlightened by the luminescence of the Torah and be included among those who fear Him and contemplate His name. For action and general intention certainly raise the soul to the source of wisdom, from which they were quarried. The matter will be seen clearly there in the light of the living King’s presence.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Living King’s presence:</b> By having the proper intention in our <i>Avodat Hashem</i>, we will merit special divine assistance to be able to fully understand these principles and to fulfill our spiritual obligations solely for the purpose of giving satisfaction to our Creator.</i>
One can further explain [based on the fact that the highest good is serving God in order to bring Him satisfaction] that upon investigating the character of the perfection of a complete life, we must conclude that the essence of [a person’s] life is will and cognition [<i>hakarah</i>], ascending from the lowest [basic natural instincts] to highest [altruistic moral intentions], the life of a complete life-soul, which is the human being.
[Reaching] perfection of life in terms of cognition certainly means the most glorious sentient beings’ perception of the most glorious knowledge, which is knowledge of the Creator. However, since we can only perceive Him in terms of His governance and the wisdom reflected in the creation of the universe, this is clearly the primary human perfection.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Primary human perfection:</b> Since a person cannot fathom the complete and utter perfection and wisdom of God, all that can truly be contemplated is the wisdom and perfection that are seen within the framework of the natural world. Therefore, when a person contemplates these matters, they will be able to reach their own necessarily limited human form of perfection.</i> For perfection applies to the object of that perfection; hence, its perfection reaches the place of its existence and being. And since God, may He be blessed, created all beings through His wisdom and will, their perfection is attained through their recognition of His wisdom in their existence, creation, and governance.
Now, just as wisdom must reach its state of perfection, so too the will must reach its state of perfection. For we observe that if a person possesses wisdom, but their will is not perfected, they are not perfect at all. On the contrary, their wisdom will only be detrimental to themselves. For example, a person who recognizes the value of proper conduct and paths of justice but who has a corrupt will and desires only evil, corruption, exploitation, and violence will never be happy. For whenever the individual focuses on their wisdom, they will be resentful because of their will, which draws them to all that is antithetical to wisdom. And when they pay attention to their corrupt will, the individual’s wisdom will reproach them and point out that this path is evil and bitter. Therefore, this person will be one of those who inherit Gehenam twice.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Inherit Gehenam twice:</b> The first punishment is in the next world, where the person must give an accounting of his negative deeds, and the second punishment is in this world, where the person’s conscience gives him no rest.</i>
We can [similarly] extrapolate from the negative to the positive, that just as there is a need for perfection of wisdom, there is a need for perfection of the will. And just as the meaning and essence of wisdom is perception and knowledge, and the aspect of it that is perfection is specifically knowledge of God’s governance and His benevolent ways, as this is the limit of perfection of the object of that perfection, the same is certainly true of the will. It means that the individual’s will is so perfect that it resembles the perfection of the ultimate will, so to speak, which is the source of all existence and their governance. If so, this is only possible if the will is inclined exclusively to carrying out the will of their Father in Heaven.
Since we have explained true perfection, which is innately desirable and pleasant, and His benevolence, may He be blessed, which is so great that He graced us with the knowledge and understanding to grasp a drop in the bucket of this, proportional to the degree of comprehension, we certainly ought to always try to fulfill that which our Sages, of blessed memory, taught us, namely: “Be strong as a leopard, and swift as an eagle, and fleet as a gazelle, and brave as a lion, to do the will of your Father who is in heaven.”
The Sages stated, “Divine service is a heavenly need.”<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><b> Divine service is a heavenly need:</b> [See R. Meir Gabai, <i>Avodat Hakodesh</i>, Section “Haavodah.”] See also <i>Nefesh Hachaim</i>, Gate II, Chapter 4 and the Shelah Toldot Hadam Hashar Hagadol.</i> Similarly, the wisest of men said by means of divine inspiration, “All of the Lord’s actions are for His sake,”<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Mishlei, Chapter 16.</i> about which the Sages, of blessed memory, said, “Everything which the Lord, may He be blessed, created, He only created for His glory.” <sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirkei Avot</i>, Chapter 6, Mishna 11.</i> You now understand that all of these statements indicate that God created everything for His sake, may He be blessed. Ostensibly, it is hard to accept this intellectually [that God created everything for His sake] as well as in terms of the fact that [this concept] appears to, God forbid, undermine divine service out of love. For divine service out of love is measured by the degree of the benefactor’s intent to benefit the recipient, as explained at length by the saint in <i>Chovot Halevavot</i> in the section on divine service.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Section on divine service</b>: See the introduction of “The Gate of Divine Service” in <i>Chovat Halevavot</i>. Here it is explained that a person should approach their <i>Avodat Hashem</i> through the prism of repaying the debt that they owe their Creator, who has given them everything out of pure love. Therefore, it is obvious that we should try to repay that as much as humanly possible by the acceptance of the mitzvot. However, if it is true “that God created everything for His sake,” that would limit our responsibility, as the benefit that we derive from the world is not given to us solely out of love for humankind but rather “for God’s sake.”</i> Aside from this, they ostensibly contradict that which is written, “The world is built through benevolence,”<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim, Chapter 89, Verse 3.</i> “If you are righteous, what do you give Him?” and similar statements in the words of the Sages.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Bereshit Rabba</i>, beginning of Chapter 44.</i>
[And therefore, how can it be that we should develop the understanding that God created everything for His sake?] However, upon completely understanding the matter, it is actually only fully explained by taking the two types of sources together. It is certainly God’s desire, may He be blessed, to provide benefit [to humanity and the world], but specifically the true, greatest, and most incredible benefit. And since only God [can] comprehend His perfection and glory, He knows that there is no greater perfection at all comparable to the perfection of comprehending Him and His will. He, therefore, wished to bestow this on His creations, since in truth, every other perfection is nonexistent in comparison to this great and sacred perfection. He, therefore, created us in such a way that we will fulfill His will. In that case, this is the enormity of the beneficence that is inestimable and completely incomparable. Therefore, it is certainly true that “The world is built through benevolence” and “If you are righteous, what do you give Him?” innately, were it not for the fact that He wishes to bestow on us this quality of fulfilling His will. Therefore, the meaning of the depth of the benevolence is that He created everything for His glory, all the Lord’s actions are for His sake, and divine service is a heavenly need.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Divine service is a heavenly need:</b> In summary, there is no disagreement between the above ideas, and there should be a holistic understanding of the seemingly contradictory sources. “God created everything for His sake”; however, “His sake” was solely for humanity’s benefit, to give the greatest and most incredible benefit, that is, the comprehension of Him and His will. Therefore, when we fulfill “His will” in the proper way, we achieve spiritual perfection for ourselves.</i>
Blessed is the Lord forever. Amen, amen.

Section 5

<b>E. Continuation of perfection of<i></i> divine service, in praise of humility [<i>a’navah</i>] and grasping the truth of existence and life</b><br><small><i>In the following section, Rav Kook lays out a deeper understanding of the concept of humility as well as the place that humanity holds in the cosmic order of the universe. Paradoxically, by recognizing the insignificance of our actions, we are able to perfect our divine service, engaging in Torah study and the fulfillment of the commandments solely to give God satisfaction.</i></small>
All of this [namely, that the purpose of divine service is to give satisfaction to the Creator] teaches us the praise of the virtue of humility and that it is the apex of all true goodness.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote"><b>True goodness</b>: As is stated in Tractate Avodah Zara 20b, “As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Humility is greater than all of them, as it is stated: ‘The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord has anointed me to bring good tidings to the humble’” (Isaiah 61:1).</i>
For the Lord, may He be blessed, set up the totality of all the systems of creation and existence in such a way that we fulfill His will by acting in accordance with His true laws, which are eternal life. He established the fulfillment of His will as our bliss so that we attain the most glorious, exalted, and sacred perfection, which no possession can equal, namely, to give the Creator, may He be blessed, satisfaction.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote"><b>May He be blessed, satisfaction</b>: This is explained at length in Section D, “Perfection of divine service out of love, solely to fulfill the will of the Lord [retzon Hashem].”</i>
As long as a person imagines that, in and of themselves, they are significant, they are inclined to think that they will do good, namely, study the Torah and perform the commandments, in order to derive benefit from them [namely, to perfect their character and draw close to the Divine]. [However, by having this selfish understanding,] the individual remains incapable of completely grasping that, since this [the study of the Torah and the performance of the commandments] gives the Creator satisfaction, it is infinitely more exalted, glorious and precious than all that is precious and valuable in the entire universe and that, therefore, it is illogical and a terrible deficiency to assign any value at all to the benefit that the person themselves derives [from their divine service]. Rather, an individual must understand that any achievement that they ascribe to themselves is not actually a function of their personality. For even the achievement of the lowliest being derives from the Creator, and His sacred influence is what elevates them, as it is written, “Your care has made me great.”<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">[Tehillim, Chapter 18. See also Shemot Rabba, Chapter 41.]</i> Therefore, everything is His, may He be blessed, and the person is innately nothing.
Since it is nearly impossible for a person to picture absolute nothingness, and certainly to thereby fix the concept in their mind that they are absolutely nothing, they should at least picture that all evil is merely a lack of good, as the Rambam, of blessed memory, writes in <i>The Guide for the Perplexed</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">[Section III:10, 11.]</i> A person can thereby picture how lowly and insignificant existence is, since it is essentially a nonexistence that would not exist at all were it not for the influence of the Creator, may He be blessed, and His benevolence. Therefore, nothing is significant at all, when weighed honestly and justly, other than the Creator, may He be blessed. Therefore, any importance that there is in all of existence is a mere accident, fancifully ascribed to the individual but really belonging to God, may He be exalted. Once all of this becomes clear, the individual will desire nothing other than to fulfill the Creator’s will and to give Him satisfaction.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Give Him satisfaction:</b> Therefore, it is clear how the attribute of humility is of the upmost importance in the task of perfecting divine service.</i>
This is the meaning of what the Sages, of blessed memory, said in <i>Avot D’Rebbi Natan</i><sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">[<i>Avot D’Rebbi Natan</i> 9:3, Moshe’s soul. See also <i>Pirkei Avot</i> 5:19.]</i> concerning the humility of our master, Moshe, which is that there were three people afflicted with boils, and Moshe was humbler than any of them. As it becomes clear to someone that he is innately insignificant and that all of his apparent importance is only because of the Creator, may He be blessed, and that He, may He be exalted, is the ultimate glorious and awesome perfection, he will realize that it is illogical and wrong to direct his efforts because of the benefit that he receives, since he knows that it gives his Creator, may He be blessed, satisfaction, and all purposes and desires should be nullified in comparison to this great and sacred goal, which is incomparable. The more one knows this truth, the more he approaches perfection of the will, meaning his will being precisely like that of his Creator. This is true life, as is written, “For he who finds me finds life and obtains favor [<i>ratzon</i>] from the Lord.”<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 8:35.</i> Infer from this that obtaining favor from the Lord is life.
A person who truly understands and comprehends will conclude from this that, since we see that the totality of existence is perfect and that, as a whole, it is headed for perfection, as the prophets foretold,<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">See Isiah 1:9.</i> the world will be filled with knowledge of the Lord, and all will know Him, from the least to greatest among them.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">See Yirmiyahu 31:33.</i> The philosophers also understood based on reason that days will come when all people will only occupy themselves with knowledge of the Lord, may He be blessed. This is because of the nature of perfection, which they discovered, while we know this more clearly and tangibly. Since everything ascends, and the end of time has no limit and conclusion,<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote"><b>No limit and conclusion</b>: The nature of the world is to constantly strive for perfection. And since the world and the cosmos are constants, so too is the striving for perfection an ongoing, never-ending process.</i> one is forced to conclude that perfection is also infinite and without limit, namely, knowledge of His name, may He be blessed.
We realize that perfection applies not only to wisdom but rather to both will and wisdom and that perfect will is primary. Therefore, just as the virtue of wisdom should be infinitely and limitlessly perfect, so too ought the virtue of perfection of the will be infinite and without limit. And there is no perfection of the will other than its being directed exclusively toward the will of the Creator. For just as the only perfection of any creature’s wisdom is in terms of God’s wisdom, there is no perfection of the will other than in terms of His will.
Were existence to have evolved automatically, God forbid, as some philosophers mistakenly think, there would not be any possibility of perfection of the will whatsoever.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Perfection of the will whatsoever:</b> For as we said, our will can only be perfected by considering the Divine will. If, God forbid, we don’t believe in the Divine cause of the universe, then we have no rubric by which to perfect our will.</i> But we recognize that just as attaining a perfected life requires perfection of wisdom, it also requires perfection of will. Therefore, just as His wisdom perceived by us is the source of our life in terms of wisdom, so too is His will the source of our life in terms of will.
Similarly, according to the heretics who claim the existence of primordial matter [from which the world was created, rather than by “<i>Yesh Mayin</i>—Something from Nothing”], everything also has an innate perfection. Therefore, it is impossible to be filled exclusively with the Creator’s will, as this would be illogical according to their claim. For how is it possible to not at least somewhat desire the benefit of that which has some reality? Therefore, according to their claim, it is impossible to attain perfection of will.
However, the truth of the matter enlightens the intellect in accordance with the approach of the faithful Torah, that there is no reality at all to anything other than Him, may He be blessed. It is therefore illogical for there to be any will other than His. In the era of perfection, when things will be completely clear to all beings, then there will be nothing except for His will, may He be blessed, and all will be attached to His will and will perceive His glory, and it will be the ultimate perfection.
If so, the foundation of creation and its perfection is contingent on perfection of humility. The Sages, of blessed memory, stated the following in Bamidbar Rabba, concerning the verse “In the beginning God created”<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishit 1:1.</i> : “That is what is written, ‘Your care has made me great.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 18:36.</i> Normally, a human king mentions his name and then his accomplishments. But the Lord, blessed is He, mentioned His accomplishments and then mentioned His name.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote"><b> Mentioned His name</b>: The Sages in the Midrash Rabba teach the following idea: In the verse, “In the beginning God created,” the word “beginning” precedes the word “God.” This teaches that God acts humbly, as it were, by placing His actions before His name. Therefore, it is specifically the trait of humility that makes one great.</i> Since humility is the foundation of the ultimate perfection of the creation, the exalted One alluded to it in the opening of the holy Torah.
According to this [understanding of man’s true place in the universe], there are two aspects to humility.
The first is that given God’s exaltedness, may He be blessed, a person’s own will is insignificant compared to that of their Creator.
The second is that given the individual’s total awareness that there is no existence at all other than the Divine, [therefore, by default] no will exists for the person other than His, may He be blessed.
It follows that reverence is a function of wisdom and humility is a function of will<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote"><b>That reverence is a function of wisdom and humility is a function of will</b>: This was stated in Chapter One, Section Two.</i> and that will is more sublime than wisdom. For wisdom is a means by which perfect will is expressed. If so, how precious is the gem found in the mouths of our Sages, of blessed memory: “That which wisdom made into a crown for its head, humility made into a sole for its foot.”<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">[Yerushalmi Shabbat 1:3.]</i> True perfection, which is the foundation of the Torah, cannot be perceived by means of wisdom and perfection of wisdom, only by means of proper will, which is true life. Contemplate this.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Contemplate this:</b> <i>Avodat Hashem</i>, which comes about due to a perfected will based on humility, is of a higher level than divine service, based on recognition through wisdom of the greatness of Hashem. Therefore, the Sages were able to say that an attribute that would be fitting to make into a crown for wisdom would only be fitting to be the “sole for the foot” of the attribute of humility.</i>
<small><i>After elaborating on the concept of humility, this section turns to the topics of the continuation of perfecting divine service and grasping the truth of existence and life.</i></small><br>Based on this, we understand that it is the inner intent of the Torah and the commandments [to enable the person to] ascend [themselves spiritually]. For in terms of the action, it is the person who performs it, while the intent and will are connected to the will of their Creator, may He be blessed, and therefore it is only through intention that a person connects his actions to the Divine will. This is why the holy Zohar referred to reverence and love as wings and said that any commandment or Torah lacking reverence and love does not fly up.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">[Tikunim 10, 6, 14 and 21 in Vilna Gaon 56b s.v. v’itmar and ibid. 57a. See <i>Tanya, Likutei Amarim</i>, Chapter 40.]</i> But once a person is filled with the light of knowledge and life of will, they will know and recognize the great power of action and that it itself is God’s perfection and glory. But ascending to this level is only possible by means of wisdom and will, both of which are rooted in faith.
We will elaborate on this further, with the Lord’s help. I would be going between mountains of fire, given my dearth of good deeds and paucity of intelligence. However, the Ari (Rabbi Yitzchak Luria), of blessed memory, and the other Sages of truth (Kabbalah) unlocked the just entrances for us in their brief discussion on “divine service being a divine need.” Many are familiar with the topic, but few understand the depths of the matter. It is not only unhelpful, but even harmful, for those who don’t understand it, having begun to explore the topic but not arriving at its true meaning, at least in a fashion that is sufficient to satisfy the minds that were wisely and justly instilled in us. Therefore, I will explain the topic for the glory of His name, may He be blessed, to be taken in conjunction with what was said above.
For the seal of the Lord, blessed be He, is truth.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">[Shabbat 55a.]</i> All of His actions and governance and will, so to speak, are certainly all truth, justice and righteousness.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">[See Daniel 4:34; Vayikra Rabba, end of Chapter 13.]</i>
Any intelligent person will understand that truth is absolutely immutable and that it makes no difference whether governance that is inclined toward perfection of righteousness and justice produces results that fulfill the will of the ruler or of someone else, only that it conforms to wisdom and truth.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Wisdom and truth:</b> While looking at an action through the prism of objective truth, it does not matter who the beneficiary of the good deed is; the only thing that matters is that the deed is performed in the best possible manner.</i> And if [a person’s actions] deviate from the perfection of righteousness and justice, the reason that this is a deficiency is not specifically because it relates to someone else [and impacts them negatively] but rather because [the action itself] does not conform to wisdom and truth.
If a person saved themselves from drowning in a vast body of water or the like and incidentally also saved a fly and was happier about saving the fly than about saving their own life and made it primary, it would be a deficiency and the antithesis of wisdom and correctness.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><b>The antithesis of wisdom and correctness:</b> Although in this situation saving the fly is an “altruistic” act and saving oneself is a “selfish” act, objective truth dictates that a person’s happiness should be on the more important action, namely, saving oneself, and not on the fly.</i> This is similar to our view of the person mentioned above, who was happier about the thousand shekels than about saving tens of thousands of people, as acting against wisdom and correctness.
But we are accustomed to the dark [physical] bodies, who don’t seek good because of the intellect and common sense but rather because of personal feelings, and feelings are completely restricted to oneself. Therefore, it is much more common to make a mistake concerning [actions] that relate to oneself than it is concerning [actions] that relate to another. Therefore, in most cases, conduct for one’s own sake is not based on justice and true wisdom [but rather on personal interests], whereas proper conduct for the sake of another, since the primary involvement with it and admonition about it is based on wisdom and righteousness, will be guided to a greater degree by them. But this is only an accident, and when the darkness of the body is absent and the aspect of forms of seeking that are inferior to that of wisdom and righteousness are absent, then they are equal, and there is no difference between the act being performed because of the will of the leader [God] or that of the follower [the person themselves].
We will now state that [all the texts that describe] the forms of divine service, ethics, and subservience to God, may He be blessed, which are based on His abundant kindness, goodness, and intention to benefit us, are certainly absolute truth. However, they are actually just insinuations of the [even more lofty and elevated] result that they produce [in a person] in terms of faith and trust and devotion to Him, may He be blessed. This is clearly true, for were it possible, from the perspective of perfect intellect, wisdom, and justice, for the essential intent to be that of benefiting us, that would have been the case.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote"><b>That would have been the case</b>: There would be no deficiency in gaining a personal spiritual benefit by serving God.</i> However, we understand that by virtue of the enormity of His exaltedness and perfection and the infinite significance of His will, it would not be in line with wisdom and justice for there to exist, so to speak, intent to benefit others in the face of fulfillment of His will,<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote"><b> Fulfillment of His will:</b> As mentioned above, there is no objective issue with receiving personal spiritual benefit from serving God. However, while looking objectively at the broader picture of God’s greatness and exaltedness, it becomes clear that serving Him for His will eclipses any other individual personal gain.</i> may He be blessed. It follows that everything is encompassed by the fulfillment of His will, just as a drop of water is encompassed by the waters of the sea, while the aspect of [God’s] benevolence [toward us] is merely in terms of knowledge that we are able to grasp. For if God did not bestow knowledge on us in this exalted manner, even though we now know that it is not in line with perfection and wisdom to primarily be happy about this, we would not attain this exalted level of being drawn close to His service. The primary motivation [in divine service] ought to be in accordance with the intellect and justice, and they instruct us that we ought to only seek and desire doing His will.
All that creatures can aspire to, because they are created, is existence, nothing more,<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote"><b> Is existence, nothing more</b>: People, having been created by God, can only live up to and within the standards and reality that He set for them, and their capacity for perfection is only in relation to their limited ability.</i> and all the many types of perfection that can be thought up are actually only the existence of a perfect Creator, may His name be blessed. This is the meaning of the Sages’ statement,<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">[See Sukkah 52a.]</i> which the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to the Messiah: “Ask of Me anything and I will give you whatever you wish.” The Messiah answered: “I ask of you only life, as it is stated: ‘He asked life of You, You gave it to him…” Since we exist, and therefore can possess knowledge and will, we recognize that in line with wisdom and justice, even the desire for existence has no significance other than the fact that it is His will, may He be blessed, for life is contingent on His will. Understand these matters, as they provide life to those who find them.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Provide life for those who find them:</b> Understanding humanity’s place in the cosmic drama of creation and the spiritual connection between humanity and the Divine will undoubtably fill a person with renewed spiritual life and energy.</i>
One might say that it is for this reason that the Sages said,<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">[Berachot 53b.]</i> “The reward of the one who answers Amen is greater than the reward of the one who recites the blessing, as the military assistants descend to the battlefield and initiate the war and then the mighty [warriors] descend and prevail.” This means that the entire matter of blessings indicates this.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Blessings indicate this</b>: In the next paragraphs, Rav Kook elucidates the nature of blessings and the answering with “Amen.” His discussion revolves around the concept of blessings as a form of <i>hakarat hatov</i> (gratitude and “Amen” as a phrase of reaffirming truth). For Rav Kook, this discussion is a natural outgrowth of the paragraphs on humility as a factor in recognizing a person’s true place in the world and their connection with the Divine.</i> We [recite a blessing before learning the Torah or fulfilling a commandment to] recognize the benevolence of God toward us by means of [receiving spiritual] pleasures [and contentment], particularly the sanctity of the commandments and the Torah and the fulfillment of each request; nonetheless, the main aspiration, inner desire, and motivation in all of these activities are that it is His will, may He be blessed, and no other intention is comparable. Therefore, we always conclude or open with “Blessed are you, Lord,” meaning that the blessing is His, may He be blessed, and is worth desiring. But within the [recitation] of the blessing itself, the possibility exists that we perhaps merely say this out of consideration for proper ethics and because it is dictated by gratitude for the [added spiritual] benefit we received in terms of ourselves. Therefore, it [that is, amen] comes to indicate that this [doing God’s will] is the ultimate and exclusive truth and ultimate reality based on wisdom and justice. This, [the answering of amen, and the understanding of the sole importance of doing God’s will] is certainly more powerful than directing the will by means of ethics alone,<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Ethics alone</b>: This means the blessing itself.</i> indicating that it is necessarily so based on wisdom and perfection, both in terms of Him, so to speak, and in terms of us, and is everlasting and powerful. Therefore, the reward of the one who answers Amen is greater than the reward of the one who recites the blessing.
It is possible to say that this is also the meaning of the opening of the gates of the Garden of Eden to which the Sages refer<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">[Shabbat 119a.]</i> when they say that “The gates of the Garden of Eden are opened for anyone who answers Amen with all of his might, as it says: ‘Open the gates and let a righteous nation that is faithful [<i>shomer emunim</i>] enter’.” For if a person doesn’t comprehend the meaning of His service, may He be blessed, and the exalted nature of His glory, that the ultimate spiritual bliss is nothing other than His glory, may He be blessed, which results from this, even if he receives a reward, and even if he grasps that the reward is perception and perfection, since he does not grasp the sanctity of divine service in all of its purity, he has acted for his own welfare and not for the sake of the act itself. Therefore, he will only receive his reward when he enters his Eden and is able to perceive it, for his abundance cannot surpass his finite and limited self.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Finite and limited self:</b> If divine service is based on limited concepts of reward and punishment and a person fulfils the commandments only to receive a spiritual reward, then only after death, when the person leaves this finite realm and with the help of God “enters Eden,” will they be able to truly grasp their reward. However, as Rav Kook writes in the next lines, a person who fulfils the commandments due to understanding the truth and desiring exclusively to satisfy the Divine will be able to receive their divine reward based not simply on their own merit but with additional heavenly rewards inasmuch as they have fully attached themselves to the Divine.</i> Not so for the one who knows the meaning of divine service and connects to it with purity of heart and desire of the soul with intellect and knowledge, with the divine commitment of the principles of wisdom and righteousness. Since his intention is not for himself, his reward is not commensurate with his essential [spiritual] worth but rather with the level of his attachment to the Holy One, blessed be He. His participation in Eden will increase commensurate with the Creator’s glory, without requiring his entry into it, merely knowledge of the perfection found in the place of His glory, may He be blessed. He will already be in his Eden by virtue of the opening of the gates, allowing him to see and perceive it. In addition, a person who also has intent for himself is considered to be opening his gates himself. But the worth of one whose will is attached to that of his Creator is infinite, and his gates will be opened from a place beyond the reach of any act, as opposed to when he is the one who opens them.
One may also suggest that, since every individual has their own Eden, as the Sages state,<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 100a.</i> it is not fitting to refer to these individual Edens as gates, only as entrances and doors. By contrast, based on what we explained, one who says Amen is connected to the totality of existence and has no individual aspect. He is superior to one whose intention is for himself, as the intellectual life that grasps general principles and encompasses all of existence is superior to the emotional life, which is restricted to himself to the exclusion of others. His entrance into Eden is, therefore, not through a private entrance but rather through the gates of the universal Eden, and Eden opens for him on a universal level.
We will now add another explanation, with the help of the Lord, may He be blessed, concerning the telos [inherent purpose] of divine service: Its exalted level demands logically that it can only be for the glory of the will of the Master, may He be blessed. If a person has any other purpose, it is a shortcoming in the perfection of their intellect and righteousness, which should only accept everything as it truly is.
The intellect would only place a secondary inherent purpose, even if it also has some value and perfection in its own right, alongside a primary and greater one—as in the example we gave of the thousand pieces of silver relative to saving the country—as a result of our deficient intellect and emotions. This is a function of our being limited and finite creatures, being limited to the degree to which we are able to absorb knowledge and values and propensities. When the soul is saturated with something, thereby becoming disposed toward it, it will consequently be deficient in its tendency toward something else.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Toward something else:</b> It is true that while looking objectively at divine service, the only impetus should be the fulfillment of the Divine will. However, as mentioned above, there is still the lower form of perfection of following the commandments for personal spiritual benefit. Rav Kook explains that as imperfect creatures, although we theoretically recognize these two forms of divine service, a person is normally satisfied with serving God for their own spiritual benefit and therefore will not have the mindset to be able to search for and then acquire the higher form of motivation for divine service.</i> It is therefore utterly impossible for a person to favor perfection in terms of the benefit that he receives, since the ways of perfection in the paths of wisdom teach us that it is a grave deficiency to value any benefit that anyone receives in comparison to the enormity of the benefit and significance of fulfilling the will of the Master, may His name be blessed. The systems of our hearts and all of the wisdom of our souls are certainly inadequate to contain even the very tip of the proper tendency toward service in His name, may He be exalted, given its greatness and glory and His sacred will. Therefore, how can we inculcate another tendency in our soul, causing a corresponding deficiency in the true life and perfection in ourselves, which are distanced from Him due to our faculties of intellect and will being preoccupied?
But in truth, no type of perfection loses its worth completely, even when pitted against a loftier perfection. Therefore, in terms of the Creator, may His name be blessed, who is exalted beyond any inclination, God forbid, certainly despite all of the greatness of the telos of the grand creation and existence, which He created for His glory, the [spiritual] intention [for the fulfillment of the commandments] nonetheless relates to each and every sort of perfection and benefit. This is because benefit in terms of its recipients is also benefit on their [current] level of perfection and good.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Perfection and good:</b> Ideally, a person should only be educated in the performance of the commandments to serve the Divine will, the greatest possible perfection. Any other sort of motivational education will inherently detract from this ultimate purpose, as mentioned above. However, this is only true in our limited human capacity of understanding and action where, if we focus on a smaller form of perfection, we are unable to reach a greater form of perfection. Nonetheless, from the Divine perspective, the smaller perfection of personal spiritual benefit is also included in the ultimate plane of Divine perfection.</i> This [understanding] is especially true at a time such as this, when people’s [spiritual and religious] views are imperfect and they have not yet attained true recognition of the primary perfection, and they take [the spiritual] benefit that they receive to be their reward [and the impetus for divine service]. [Therefore] The intention to benefit them is certainly a perfect telos under these circumstances, except with respect to people of comprehension, where there is a greater perfection that overrides it.
[And that which is written:] The beneficiary’s [humanity’s] obligation of humility and subservience to his benefactor [God] is proportional to the benefactor’s intent to bestow benefit on him, as explained at length in <i>Chovot Halevavot</i> in the section “Divine service,”<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Divine service:</b> In this section, Rav Kook addresses a misunderstanding that could arise from an incomplete understanding of the <i>Chovot Halevavot’</i>s intentions in his chapter on divine service. There, it is written: “Service may be defined as a beneficiary's submission to his benefactor, expressed in rendering good that is within his power to the latter in return for the favor received. Therefore, whoever considers God's bounties, bestowed upon him, which are in common with all other human beings, will faithfully accept the obligation of the service of God in the ways indicated by his intellect” (in the section on divine service, Chapter 3). This would seem to indicate that a person’s intention in fulfilling the Divine will should be motivated by a sense of gratitude and not by a simple desire to fulfill the Divine will. However, as Rav Kook will explain, <i>Chovot Halevavot</i>’s intentions are for a person to contemplate the <b>mental recognition</b> of being a beneficiary and how that reflects on the Divine perfection, rather than the <b>physical benefit</b> itself.</i> and is [only] a function of the benefactor’s perfection [namely, that He is so wholly perfect that He also desires to benefit others]. The benefactor’s perfection is proportional to his intention to benefit others. This is the root of subservience to the truly perfect One. The benefit is actually only a matter of experiencing [recognizing] this perfection in some sense. Although due to our deficient knowledge we don’t experience this subservience to our benefactor, it is actually its sole root and essence. Therefore, we have learned that we certainly owe the Creator, may His name be blessed, every aspect of subservience, based on His intention to benefit us alone. This is the absolute truth. In addition, He arranged His will such that it be fulfilled by our actions because this is the most perfect good, which has no equal. Nonetheless, our divine service should be in our hearts and intellect primarily for the sole purpose of increasing and exalting His glorious name. For to the degree that we include any other purpose, we will lose a portion of this true perfection, which is mandated by perfection and logic.
Therefore, in this world, where only our personal benefit is perceived, the primary intention for the existence of the creation, as it is currently, is our perfection and welfare. For it is inappropriate to say regarding the Creator, may He be blessed, that there are matters that are only a means to an end if their existence is not intrinsically good. For nothing prevents Him from accomplishing His goals without intermediary means. This was somewhat noted by the Rambam, of blessed memory, in <i>The Guide for the Perplexed</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">[See I:69; II:12.]</i> Rather, all the (positive) actions are necessary and good in their own right. The fact that they are means is not because it is necessary for the telos. Rather, it being done in this manner is the path of perfection, in accordance with wisdom known to Him, may He be blessed.
We need to express the concept of intention, in the context of each level in the world and its creatures, in accordance with its level, this being its truth, and the manner of divine service will flow from this. In this world, in which this great perfection has not yet been revealed to people, namely, that the essence of everything is His will, may He be blessed, the governance, providence, and telos are currently only for beneficence and our welfare.
However, in terms of divine service, we call out in His name, <i>Havaya</i>, may He be blessed, referring to the fact that He was, He is, and He will be [<i>haya, hoveh v’yihiyeh</i>]. Therefore, “the righteous lives by his faith,”<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Habakkuk 2:4.</i> even though this is not perceived currently, to establish his divine service on the ultimate level, based on what will be revealed in detail in the future and is currently revealed in general terms to those wishing to walk on the pathways of life. For the entire hope is for the time when the Lord alone will be exalted and the hand of the Lord will be revealed together with His glory, and He will rejoice in His works. As it is written, “We will rejoice and exult in His deliverance.”<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 25:9.</i> Understand this.

Section 1

<big><strong>Clarification of the Soul’s Traits [<i>middot</i>]</strong></big><br><i><small>This chapter emphasizes the significance of accurately defining each positive character trait and distinguishing it from similar but negative traits. It specifically focuses on the traits of pride and humility, highlighting the importance of understanding their distinctions. Additionally, this chapter underscores the prohibition of leading others astray through negative character traits and causing harm to others through improper behavior.</small></i>
<b>A. Clarification of the traits and the process of severing [<i>nesirah</i>] them</b>
The clarification of the soul’s traits consists of two aspects.
The first is for a person to know how to differentiate between those that are positive and those that are negative, assign them to their appropriate tasks, affix them in his soul, and clothe<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><b> To clothe himself with them:</b> This means to accustom his soul to the performance of good deeds and positive character traits. [See <i>Pirkei Avot</i>, Chapter 6, “And clothes him with humility and reverence”; <i>Derech Hachaim</i>, ad loc.] In <i>Derech Hachaim</i>, the Netziv explains the metaphor of clothing as signifying the overarching importance of these traits and their role as an adornment for the individual. Just as clothing enhances a person's appearance and brings honor, these traits are considered garments of splendor. They beautify and elevate the person who possesses them, symbolizing their spiritual and moral refinement.</i> himself with them so that they are always at his disposal.
The second is separating the traits and severing them.
That is to say, a superficial perspective and understanding of positive traits is a good start [toward spiritual refinement], as the attraction to their beauty and majesty leads one to perfection. However, there are traits that naturally interface.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Naturally interface</b>: Certain positive traits have aspects that, if not handled carefully, can potentially veer toward negative character traits.</i> When a person tries to develop a certain trait within himself in an imprecise fashion, the adjacent trait will automatically be drawn along with it, even though it is not appropriate and not what he needs. A person must contemplate deeply so that he can distinguish—by means of wisdom and understanding, which surpass the nature of the traits and bring the traits into their chambers,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Traits into their chambers:</b> While addressing the separation and severing of unwanted traits, it is necessary to harness the powers of wisdom and understanding, as these cognitive faculties examine the traits with moderation and a calm mind rather than hasty and impulsive judgments. This allows for a careful and balanced assessment of one's characteristics rather than rash and impulsive judgments. This aligns with the verse in Mishlie that states, "knowledge fills the rooms." [See Mishlei 24:4; Zohar, Mishpatim, 123b.]</i> develop them properly, and separate that which ought to be separated—each trait and its naturally adjacent trait so that each trait can be taken individually, without taking its contaminant<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">[See Avoda Zara 39a.]</i> with it. This is along the lines of the severing mentioned by the Ari, of blessed memory.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">[<i>Eitz Hachaim</i>, Section “Hakelalim,” Chapter. 13, Section 29, Section “Hanesirah.”]</i>
There are several causes of interfacing between traits and blurring of boundaries between them. Sometimes two traits are adjacent because they are similar on a superficial level, and it is impossible to acquire only one of them without having a powerful image of it [the character trait in question]. But if the image is not completely clear, one will end up with more or less than the desired trait, incorporating parts of other traits that ostensibly bear a superficial resemblance to it.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Superficial resemblance to it:</b> This refers to incorporating negative aspects into the positive trait.</i> An individualized examination of each trait and its aspects, in terms of how and why the different traits interface, is needed in order to know how it is possible to separate them.
However, this investigation varies from person to person. For some, the organization of the interfaces between their traits is different than it is for others. This can be the result of differences between people in views and perceptions. Nonetheless, it would appear that it is possible to uncover general rules [regarding the character traits], making it easier for each individual to clarify his particular system of interfaces and thereby follow the way of the good.
In addition, each person will find much in common with others his own age, as well as many things that should have a common root.
Among [the fundamentals of] the soul’s traits requiring perfection is the trait of fortitude [<i>gevurah</i>], meaning fortitude of the soul, without which it is utterly impossible to be truly perfect in terms of knowledge and fear of the Lord. It is certainly impossible to accomplish anything significant without it. The trait of fortitude includes the following: Once a person decides that he needs to work on something out of an obligation to perfect himself, he will be firmly committed to it and will not become fed up with the numerous minutiae. His soul’s fortitude will guide him to act with pure desire, doing whatever is necessary to achieve good results, even if they are a long way off.
Without the trait of fortitude, when he is first infused with fear of the Lord and the obligation to be diligent in observing the commandments, he is enthused to learn the Torah diligently to know his Creator’s glory and the manner in which one can do what He deems good, but by the time he goes on to engage in the depths of analysis and sacred expanses of its breadth and details, his enthusiasm emanating from the original perception will already have petered out. Therefore, he needs the trait of fortitude in order to exercise self-control so that he continues to firmly hold on to what he engaged in for the benefit of his soul. Consequently, the soul’s constant joy, filled with the tranquility of being fixed within the power of ascension, will increase. Thus, the joy of the soul will remain unchanging in the face of the depths and their perplexing streams.
In his introduction to <i>Mesilat Yesharim</i>, the saint explained that people refrain from studying (or barely study) topics relating to divine service, such as love, reverence, and improvement of one’s traits, because the basic obligation concerning these topics is well known. For this reason, people see no need to delve into their fundamentals and details.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Introduction to <i>Mesilat Yesharim.</i> </i> However, there is another, more fundamental reason for this, which is a lack of the trait of fortitude. For when a person begins to investigate these lofty matters, he is terrified and enfeebled as a result of seeing himself as being distant from the fulfillment of the great obligations that they impose. Therefore, great fortitude is required. He must not be discouraged by the knowledge that the essence of perfection is contingent on perfect, true knowledge of the Torah. Rather, he must investigate all the ways of divine service and piety without being overly intimidated by his distance from them. Instead, he should calmly and bravely resolve to try and attain their perfection. As soon as he fully grasps the true understanding of a certain detail, he should put it into practice.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Put it into practice:</b> One obstacle to self-improvement is the mistaken belief that if one cannot give 100 percent, there is no point in trying at all. Rav Kook emphasizes the importance of recognizing that even small efforts make a difference and not becoming discouraged by current imperfections. Every small step toward improvement contributes to eventual perfection.</i>
However, it is not easy for a person to acquire the trait of fortitude. Indeed, it can only be acquired by means of the Torah and diligence, as it is written, “I am understanding; courage is mine.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Mishlei 8:14; <i>Pirkei Avot</i>, Chapter. 6.</i> But for someone lacking fortitude, there is no guarantee of success merely because he immerses himself in these matters. Due to his weakness, he will not be able to carry them out properly. Therefore, one should strive to acquire the trait of fortitude and its purification to serve as a foundation upon which he can build an edifice of studying the ethical and divine topics. Correspondingly, fortitude of the soul is a very valuable trait that is necessary for attaining every sort of perfection, whether specific or general.
But very few people attain it in its pure form, as it interfaces with several negative traits: anger, arrogance, jealousy, hatred, competitiveness, vengeance, and the like. Sometimes this trait [of fortitude] will be found among those who have not paid attention and [acquired for themselves] fear of the Lord, [and therefore their fortitude comes] with its wicked neighbors [anger, arrogance, and others]. [Likewise,] some people undertake to bear the yoke of reverence but do not make the [proper] effort to investigate the correction of their traits in detail and do not distinguish between it [ the trait in question] and its surrounding neighbors, and therefore they abandon the process entirely. But if done properly, separating and selecting the waste from the worthwhile, all of the positive traits wicked neighbors will obey it and do that which is good and proper in the eyes of the Lord, may He be blessed.
[Similar to fortitude,] there are many other traits that need to be severed in this way. As long as they are attached to each other, they will not produce successful results.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Successful results:</b> This is because the negative aspects will outweigh and pervert the positive ones.</i> There are, in fact, spiritual forces that interface with negative forces on many sides in most of their applications. There are also those that only interface with a few negative ones. This distinction can help guide the ways by which the positive trait is extricated from [the influence of] its wicked neighbors.
Humility [<i>anavah</i>] is a positive trait when a person knows its meaning, understands the concept well, and knows how to apply it and incorporate it into his soul. But when viewed superficially, the trait of humility carries with it the trait of sadness [<i>itzavon</i>], because they resemble each other on a superficial level. For [example] joy and arrogance [<i>ga’ava</i>] both disperse one’s spiritual forces, except that joy disperses them in a positive fashion, whereas arrogance disperses them in a negative way.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><b>In a negative way:</b> Both pride and happiness can make a person feel joyful and spiritually expansive, but the crucial distinction lies in their effects. Humility leads to positive expansiveness, while pride leads to negative expansiveness.</i>
Similarly, the trait of humility consolidates and settles them, as does sadness, one in a good way and the other in a bad way.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><b>In a bad way:</b> Similarly, both humility and sadness can lead to a concentration and in-gathering of the soul's capacities. Humility results in a positive gathering because the person recognizes that their qualities come from a higher source, leaving no room for arrogance. Conversely, sadness leads to negative in-gathering of the soul's capacities due to the person's lack of self-belief.</i> So too, the positive trait of humility interfaces with the negative trait of sadness. If a person does not study the fine points of actualizing his traits, then when the topic of humility comes up and he wants to contemplate it by means of recognizing his shortcomings, the two traits will merge, and sadness will blur and obscure all the pleasantness and radiance of humility.
Indeed, although on a superficial level they seem to share the same path, at the depths of their roots they are very different.
For sadness only arises after a person has decided that his personal level is exalted and that he is deserving of greatness but is then disappointed to discover deficiencies and shortcomings in himself that are unbecoming to him. This is certainly heartbreaking and contains no element of truth.
However, the trait of humility results from his knowing that he is not innately worthy of any sort of greatness and that any greatness and goodness that he attains are due to the benevolence of the Lord, blessed be He, toward him. He will then be lowly and deficient in his own eyes, yet experience no sadness. Rather, he will rejoice in his fate, and he will thank the Lord for His benevolence concerning the small amount of good that he discovers in himself. He will also eagerly pursue the attainment of many other delightful virtues. For since he sees that despite being inherently unworthy, the Lord, blessed be He, graced him with goodness, this will also suffice for him to acquire even greater and more amazing attainments.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Amazing attainments:</b> When a person acknowledges that any good qualities they possess are gifts from God and not solely a result of their own merit, they become filled with optimism, believing that these qualities will continue to grow and multiply if they make the effort to cultivate them.</i>

Section 2

<b>B. Clarifying the elements of the trait—the trait of arrogance</b>
When we investigate the essential root of any of the traits and how to avoid their prohibitions and navigate them properly, it is crucial to understand the substance of the trait, its nature, and its form.
We see that all physical substances are composed of elements, and those elements themselves are complex. This is in accordance with the true principle, which we were taught by the Sages of true wisdom, that the only simple existence is the infinite source, the ultimate cause, blessed is He. Even the heavenly spheres [<i>sefirot</i>] are complex and an admixture of the heavenly attributes, for “sacred matters require a quorum of ten.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Quorum of ten:</b> The halachic mandate of a minyan of ten people for prayers and commandments can be applied metaphorically to mean that holiness is often found in intricate and complex aspects of the world. Therefore, to truly understand and explore any material and spiritual existence, one must grasp the fundamental principles and nuances upon which they are constructed.</i> Therefore, one must understand matter’s fundamental composition. So too, spiritual traits are comprised of fundamental forces and are transformed as a result of their arrangement. One who seeks the truth must investigate the details of their composition and their components.
This is certainly true of the trait of arrogance. Like all traits, its substance is not simple but rather is composed of discrete characteristics. However, who knows if we have discovered all the elements of which it is composed. After all, even when it comes to physical substances, we cannot be certain that we have discovered all the elements. (The current count is sixty-three elements, and this conforms to the Kabbalistic opinion<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">[<i>Eitz Hachaim</i>, Area A, Section A, Chapters 3 and 4. Introductory section, <i>Abba V’ima</i>, Chapter 9. <i>Da’at Chochma</i> III:28.]</i> that the essential foundation consists of the sixty-three sections of [the sphere of] understanding [<i>binah</i>]; nonetheless, there are many aspects for which there are complements for their complements).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Complements for their complements</b>: As of the year 2023, there are 118 chemical elements that have been discovered. However, when Rav Kook wrote this work, there were only 63 major elements known to the scientific community. Rav Kook explains that because there is a constant increase in our knowledge of the natural world, our understanding of its workings can never be complete. Similarly, in the spiritual realm, our understanding of character traits is never complete. However, one must do their upmost to analyze the characteristics of these traits to the best of one’s ability.</i> Nonetheless, to the degree that we increase our knowledge in this area, we will learn lessons from it, and as we train ourselves in the pursuit of perfection, this knowledge will lighten the burden of refinement.
It would appear that the elements that are immediately obvious [in the trait of arrogance] are:
A. A very high degree of self-love, the desire to draw all pleasantness to oneself.
B. A misguided sense of imagination, exaggerating one’s strengths manifold relative to their true stature.
C. A further error of the imagination, thinking that whatever is thought about and assigned importance to is actually significant and successful, despite the fact that the reality is otherwise. Therefore, the person makes every effort to reinforce and validate what they imagine by depiction, word, and deed.
D. The primary issue is ignorance of the true nature of virtues.
There are certainly further details and minutiae, but it seems that arrogance would not enter one’s heart without these, nor can it be cured without removing these negative elements and refining them in the kiln of truth.

Section 3

<b>C. Arrogance and humility and the depths of their roots in the heart and soul</b>
Love of arrogance has a special root in the depths of man’s heart, which can be derived from the language of the verse: “Ah, the proud crowns of the drunkards of Ephraim,”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">[Yeshayahu 28:1.]</i> which compares arrogance to drunkenness, from which it would seem that they share a common evil root.
There is a vast difference between what a perfected person who recognizes the truth wants to attain and what the fool wishes to attain. The consequent actions and traits branch out from this root. The root of the matter is that the wise man yearns for the inner dimension of goodness, recognizing it and knowing that only it is the true good. But the fool yearns for the external dimension of goodness based on its superficial appearance, as he does not recognize the superior good that it contains within. His intellect is, therefore, incapable of grasping the deficiencies of the external good.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><b>The external good:</b> The fool does not comprehend that there is a broad inner dimension of complete and true spiritual goodness. Consequently, they settle for their superficial understanding, with all its shortcomings.</i>
<i><small>In the coming paragraphs, Rav Kook proceeds to present various levels of understanding regarding the purpose of life and the feelings of the soul.</small></i><br>The Creator, Blessed be He, instilled a love of life in all living creatures because it is good. The value of life is certainly a function of goodness, as the benevolent God chose to benefit His creations by means of life. The essence of life is the sense of one’s existence,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Sense of one’s existence</b>: The most sublime definition of "life" is the consciousness of human existence. In the words of the famous philosopher Descartes, “I think, therefore I am.”</i> and the quality of life improves in proportion to the extent to which one experiences that which is external to himself to a greater degree, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This is because the core of life is the sense of one’s existence, but its greatness and value are contingent on experiencing that which is external to oneself to a greater degree, quantitatively and qualitatively. If those things that a person experiences are more numerous and more worthwhile and significant, then the quality of his life will also improve. Since the significance of that which is experienced improves the quality of life, love of a life of benevolence motivates a person to improve those things that he experiences.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Those things that he experiences</b>: In simple terms, God, in His kindness, made all living creatures love life because it is good. Life's value depends on its goodness, as God intended to benefit His creations through life. The essence of life is the awareness of one's existence, and life improves when a person experiences more things outside of themselves, both in quantity and quality. The more numerous and significant the experiences, the better the quality of life. Therefore, the love for a good life motivates people to seek and improve their experiences.</i>
The Lord, may He be blessed, created the sentient soul in a significant and wonderous way. Therefore, by virtue of its significance, the soul’s very life essence already has a major share in sentient life, to which it is attached more than any other sentient creature, aside from its being the conduit for life.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Conduit for life:</b> In addition to the aspect of the soul giving physical life to a person, the soul is extremely affected by its ability to be a conduit for connecting with the Divine and for receiving the spiritual good that a person perceives around themselves.</i> Therefore, if a person makes an effort to increase the significance of his soul and improve its characteristics, he will improve the quality of his life.
However, increasing his bliss does not depend on this alone. For in the final analysis, his soul is only one central point relative to the infinite expanse of everything else that it experiences. Therefore, a person should always endeavor to make everything that exists, which is what he experiences, better and more significant. And the Lord, may He be blessed, who is benevolent to all, empowered man to do so, as He created him such. For the endeavor to perfect himself depends on him alone, which is not true of all the heavenly creatures, who attain their goodness effortlessly. This superiority is a function of their mission, not their nature.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Not their nature</b>: Although the nature of man is not perfection, its mission is. God, in His wisdom, has charged humans, through their own free will, to take an active part in striving to perfect and uplift the world through their actions.</i>
However, man’s primary perfection is perceiving the brilliance of the divine light, which He, may He be blessed, graced us with the ability to reveal and which enables us to increase the power of the heavenly entourage by means of our actions. Therefore, our thoughts must always be focused on serving our Creator, blessed is He, by making the illumination of the luminescent brilliance as great and significant as possible.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Significant as possible</b>: In this higher spiritual level of perfection, our primary focus should be on actions that bring goodness and work to enhance and revel the manifestation of the Divine presence in the most qualitative manner possible in this world.</i> This is accomplished through perfect service in observing the Torah and the commandments wholeheartedly and studying the Torah diligently. We should exclusively yearn to see the King in His splendor and to give honor to His name, as the radiance of His face is life.
This is the intermediate approach, not rising to the level of perfect honor in divine service. Nonetheless, it is a good gateway, and it is good to be educated in this manner, and one should plead with the heavenly God that He shine His face on us and raise us up from this service to the perfect and desired service, on which the true main heavenly honor is contingent.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Heavenly honor is contingent:</b> This is explained in Chapter 2, Sections 4 and 5.</i>
<i><small>Rav Kook now returns to the opening discussion of the section: namely, the importance of recognizing the inner dimension of a character trait, and the dangers of focusing solely on a trait’s superficial appearance.</small></i><br>Let us return to our point that love of a life of benevolence is the root of perfection and its gateway and, therefore, is firmly rooted in every soul and is the foundation for how the souls govern themselves. But what is the description of the superior and significant in life, which a person should yearn for?
There is a major principle that if something is good; honorable, important, and in its proper place; and perceived individually and at its level, its depiction will evoke complete tranquility, peace, and quiet, and the person perceiving it will be filled with satisfaction.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><b> With satisfaction:</b> When a person approaches refinement of their character in a steady and precise way, progressing according to their current spiritual level and understanding, they will certainly be filled with satisfaction.</i> However, someone who views those trappings of honor from afar perceives something that is tumultuous, lacking in tranquility alongside the aspect of virtue and pleasantness.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Virtue and pleasantness:</b> As mentioned, the higher purpose of life is to reveal the presence of God in the world. This task can initially be externally perceived with a sense of inner turmoil and lack of contentment with this seemingly daunting task, alongside an intense feeling of delight. The difference between a wise person and a fool, according to Rav Kook, is how they deal with this sense of turmoil. The wise person will continue their efforts and spiritual advancements until they find a sense of complete contentment. However, as will be explained, the fool will believe that the turmoil is part and parcel of life and will try to fill themselves with earthly pleasures to distract them from their inner struggles.</i>
But when a wise individual discerns that absolute good must be accompanied by peace and quiet and an abundance of complete tranquility, he will try to attain such a life, finding them through true knowledge, perfect service, and refinement of all of his traits to reach the ultimate goodness and holiness.
But a fool will accept the superficial depiction of virtue and yearn for it in the form that he pictures it, in the form of turmoil and a sense of urgency, conspicuous in terms of its vulgar sensuality, finding it by gladdening his heart through fulfilling his fantasies and lust and yearning for spacious palaces and extensive rule over everyone else.
However, the pleasure of eating and drinking and other sensual pleasures are only felt at the moment of turmoil and vulgar sensuality, which a lowly soul desires. But “The belly of the wicked is empty.”<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Mishlie 13:25.</i> Since he cannot always fill himself up with them, his desire for emotional sensations, these being more consistently available, will intensify—for example, the sensation of drunkenness, in which one experiences a lack of tranquility and thoughts confused by turbulent imagination. The fool considers this to be intense living.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Intense living:</b> Therefore, a person uses alcohol to fill the internal emotional void by imitating a feeling of contentment and fulfillment brought about by drunkenness.</i>
However, arrogance is an even more constant sensation of this kind. It causes a person to experience himself in such a way that he rejoices in a vulgar manner over any virtue or success that he can ascribe to himself. The nature of narcissism induces him to persist in this contemptible pleasure, which is a physical and illusory pleasure, based on falsehood and nothingness. When he experiences this vulgar pleasantness, he tries to intensify it by constantly ascribing to himself numerous great and amazing accomplishments, virtues, and successes, of which he does not actually possess even a shred. That which he does possess, he magnifies a thousandfold, causing him to be extremely entangled in falsehood as his soul becomes accustomed to crudeness, ascribing to himself whatever virtues and honor he can imagine in order to enjoy them through his false imagination. Such a person will never attain true wisdom, will never truly be able to partake in divine service, and will corrupt the true nature of his soul.
Therefore, a person should strive to attain true knowledge, with his eye constantly trained on that which he is lacking in order to attain perfection, and his soul should cleave to love of the eternal strength, to Whom honor belongs and in Whose place are strength and joy. Then he will not think that he possesses that which he does not, because the bliss that he seeks, the true good and the attainment of pure beliefs and sacred virtues, and that which he possesses will not grow in his imagination to exceed the truth, as he only desires a calm, pleasant, and tranquil perception, and tranquility and sacred pleasantness can only exist when everything is properly and truthfully established. Realizing the extent of his imperfection will not prevent him from being happy about the small amount of perfection that he does possess. For since his beliefs and character are in accordance with an accurate evaluation, neither idea negates the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Neither idea negates the other</b>: As mentioned, when a person believes that everything they have, including life itself, is a gift from God and that their purpose is to make God's presence known in this world through Torah study and fulfilling the commandments, they will find joy in the small level of perfection they have achieved. At the same time, they will strive for even greater perfection for the sake of Heaven.</i>
But a fool, who does not train himself to evaluate his status truthfully, can only be happy when he imagines himself to be flawless. As soon as he envisions any imperfection in himself, his happiness will be thrown into confusion, even in terms of that which he has reason to be happy about. This is due to the fact that his happiness is dependent on imagination rather than on true knowledge. Therefore, once his imagination envisions a deficiency, there is no longer any room for joy. For the imagination is similar in nature to the physical, and its boundaries are not broad enough to encompass both the image of the true status and that of the deficiency simultaneously.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Deficiency simultaneously:</b> The fool, lacking the ability to assess his own situation honestly, can only be happy when he believes he is flawless. The moment he recognizes any imperfections in himself, his happiness is disturbed, even if there are valid reasons for him to be happy about certain aspects of his life. The reason for this lies in the fool's reliance on imagination rather than true knowledge. His happiness is dependent on a superficial perception of himself, and when he imagines a deficiency, he loses the ability to find joy.</i>
By contrast, the refined intellect’s knowledge is unrestricted and allots the proper place to each item, and it does not fail to rejoice about what is good in him, despite its longing to correct his deficiencies, of which it is keenly aware.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Keenly aware:</b> The person with refined intellect due to their knowledge is aware of their shortcomings but can still rejoice in their positive aspects because their understanding is deep and realistic. Their refined intellect acknowledges the need for improvement while appreciating the good within themselves.</i> “But the lowly shall inherit the land, and delight in abundant well-being.”<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">[Tehillim 37:11; Sukkah 29b.]</i>

Section 4

<b>D. The details of arrogance and honor [<i>kavod</i>] in word and deed</b>
The commandment prohibiting arrogance encompasses the obligation to distance oneself from anything that stirs his character and nature to arrogance. It seems clear that the inclusion of bawdry [<i>nivul peh</i>] in the prohibitions of sexual immorality [<i>giluy ‘arayot</i>] is “an item that belonged to a category and was singled out for the purpose of teaching about the entire category.”<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Entire category:</b> One of the Thirteen Principles of Torah Exegesis.</i> It is similarly prohibited to engage in speech that is inclined to arouse him to anything that is prohibited. In the case of bawdry, as the saint stated correctly in <i>Mesilat Yesharim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><b>In <i>Mesilat Yesharim</i>:</b> [Chapter 11, concerning exploitation and theft, that a catalyst is itself included in the prohibition. Also, in the Yerushalmi Terumot I:4: Sexual immorality [<i>ervat davar</i>]–bawdry [<i>ervat dibbur</i>]. Similarly, in Rashi Shabbat 103a, s.v. <i>Ervat</i>. <i>Sefer Chareidim</i>, Chapter 4, negative commandment 49: Bawdry is an extension of the commandment. It would appear from what it says in Shabbat 33, “due to the sin of bawdry,” that it is part of the primary biblical prohibition, like all those that precede it, in line with the statement of the <i>Sha’agat Aryeh</i>, 24, concerning the blessing on learning Torah, that the severity of the punishment for refraining from reciting the blessing indicates that reciting it is a biblical mandate.]</i> the prohibition is essentially due to the obscenity of the speech itself and not because it leads to the actual prohibition. The same is true in the case of every sort of speech that normally stirs the heart to something evil, such as arrogance or flattery and the like. Even if a person were to say that he is not concerned about it due to his nature, nonetheless it remains prohibited. It is only in the case of an extremely pious person, on the level of earlier generations, that one could say that it is permitted if he sees that the present circumstances require it. As stated in the first chapter, “his own statements contradict each other.”<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Contradict each other:</b> [Shabbat 13a.] The Gemara in the Tractate Shabbat tells a story about Rabbi Pedat, who used to greet his sisters with a kiss as a sign of respect. However, his own opinion contradicted this behavior, as he believed that physical closeness to his sister was prohibited. The commentators of the Gemara explained that Rabbi Pedat permitted himself to act this way because he was a truly righteous person and did not fear any sinful thoughts resulting from his actions. The sage Rav commented that Rabbi Pedat's leniency was applicable only to exceptionally righteous individuals of the previous generations, and even for them, it was permitted only temporarily and for a specific purpose.</i>
The matter still requires investigation as to whether or not this is conclusive, as perhaps prohibitions of speech might be intrinsically forbidden, as we find in such cases in the context of sexual immorality,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">[Ibid. 33a.]</i> Shabbat,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">[Ibid. 113a.]</i> and handing a Jew over to gentiles [<i>mesirah</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">[Bava Kama 117a.]</i> that speech is prohibited [in addition to the action itself]. So too in the case of idolatry,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">[Mishna Sanhedrin 7:6.]</i> an independent prohibition, and one could say that this is true of all prohibitions, or at least those which a person is naturally inclined to transgress.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Naturally inclined to transgress</b>: Therefore, like the examples provided above, any action that leads toward arrogance would also be included in the transgression itself.</i>
It follows that a person who speaks in a manner that incites him to arrogance transgresses two prohibitions: arrogance and bawdry of arrogance. Even if it does not end up leading to actual arrogance, he still has failed to avoid one of them.
It is obvious that the issue of stimulating one’s evil inclination to entice himself applies to every case where his nature was placid and calm and then he, by means of his actions, places himself on a path leading to evil; and that it does not only apply to sexual immorality. He is not permitted to enter<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Not permitted to enter:</b> [Bava Batra 98a.] As “Rabbi Ami says: With regard to anyone who brings himself into a state of arousal, they do not bring him within the boundary of the Holy One, Blessed be He” [Nida 13b].</i> into the domain of the Lord, blessed be He, due to the enormity of the evil resulting from it.
However, if fulfilling a commandment requires him to speak in a manner that appears arrogant, it is permitted based on the rule that a positive commandment overrides a negative one in a case where it is impossible to fulfill both. That is to say, where he feels that it is absolutely impossible for him to achieve the desired result without speaking in this fashion, then he is obligated to be careful that it does not lead to actual arrogance, although the extension is permitted by the extension of the positive commandment that overrides it.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><b> Commandment that overrides it:</b> In essence, as mentioned, speaking arrogantly is included in the prohibition of arrogance. However, there are exceptional circumstances where it might be permitted if necessary to fulfill a commandment and no other option exists to achieve the desired objective. In these situations, the positive commandment takes precedence over the prohibition of arrogance. However, it is important to note that the prohibition of arrogance in one's heart remains in effect, regardless of the circumstances.</i>
The prohibitions of arrogance include the prohibition against speaking arrogantly, even where it does not lead to actual arrogance. This is clear from the Talmudic discussion in the chapter “Elu Devarim” in Pesachim, which states that we learn from the cases of Devorah and Hillel that if a person is arrogant, if that person is a sage, he loses his wisdom, and if a prophet, he loses his prophecy.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><b>He loses his prophecy:</b> Pesachim 66b.</i> Those were only instances of speech, as one cannot suppose that righteous people of their caliber were arrogant and that is why they spoke as they did. Rather, the very act of speaking in this manner is included in the prohibition. Or, more likely, it is revealed to the One Who knows secrets that it is impossible for a person to speak arrogantly and not become arrogant to some minor degree, and even the most infinitesimal amount is prohibited.
Either way, it [the trait of arrogance] is prohibited. It follows that announcing one’s own praises and virtues, concerning matters of Torah, wisdom, or other virtues, is prohibited because of the actual prohibition of arrogance.
It is only permitted in a case of great necessity, just as physical contact is permitted in such a case for a very pious person for the sake of a positive commandment. The precedent for this is the case of a certain holy man<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">[See Pesachim 113b: The holy Rabbis, Yevamot 20: One who fulfills the principle of piety is holy; Nidda 12: Modest.]</i> who would carry [a bride] on his shoulders and say: “If she is like a beam to you, fine, but if not, you may not.”<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">[Ketubot 17a.]</i> We similarly find a number of such cases that were permitted for holy people due to the exigencies of the moment. This dispensation can only be utilized by one who is worthy and only at the appropriate time.
Examples of this include “Do not teach humility [ceased], for there is still me” and “Do not teach that fear of sin [ceased], for there is still me.”<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><b>For there is still me:</b> Regarding the words in the Mishnah at the end of Tractate Sotah, "With the passing of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, humility and fear of sin ceased," the Gemara brings the statements of Rav Yosef, who said to a disciple who had memorized the Mishnayot before him, "Do not say that humility ceased, for I am humble," and similarly, the words of Rav Nachman, who said the same about fear of sin ("Even though Rabbi Yehuda has passed, fear of sin has not departed from the world, for I am here"). It is difficult to understand how these Amoraim praised themselves, especially considering that praising oneself is forbidden due to the prohibition of arrogance. Rav Kook uses these examples to explain that exceptional and holy individuals are permitted in specific situations to speak words of self-praise. In these cases, those Amoraim needed to say this to prevent this Mishnah from being understood as an axiom, leading people to mistakenly believe that there is no reason to make an effort to acquire the attribute of humility. The reason they chose to testify about themselves in this manner was to demonstrate that it is still possible to arrive at even the highest level of humility—where it is permissible to speak words of arrogance externally, as explained earlier [Sota 49b].</i> These are necessary for the sake of a commandment, in order not to formulate the Mishna in a misleading way. Therefore, Rabbi Yehuda Hanasi demonstrated that this tradition only referred to humility and fear of sin of the highest level.
The same is true of the statements of R. Shimon bar Yochai: “I have seen the elite” and “I can absolve.”<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">[Sukka 45b.]</i> These statements are essentials of the Torah, for a number of essentials of the Torah concern matters of souls, their connections, and their virtues, and knowledge of R. Shimon bar Yochai’s level is itself halacha. It contains a number of derivatives and extensions rooted in the Torah. We find<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">[Vayikra Rabba, 26, similar to what is found in Megilla 19b, namely, that the Lord, blessed be He, showed Moshe the nuances of the Torah and the nuances of the Sages and others.]</i> that the Lord, blessed be He, showed Moshe each generation and its Sages; therefore, this knowledge is also Torah. He, therefore, viewed the extension that was contingent on knowledge of his existence as a crucial extension, and it was not proper to deny people the benefit of this knowledge, which could perfect them in terms of this area of the Torah.
Also, it is sometimes permitted for a very pious person to praise himself so that others will envy his virtues, and “the envy of Sages will increase wisdom.” The greater the envisioned benefit that can only be attained in this fashion, the broader the license to employ this approach. This category encompasses the statement of Abaye: “I am like Ben Azzai in the marketplaces of Tiberias.”<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Marketplaces of Tiberias:</b> The Amora Abaye used to say, "I am ready and prepared to answer any Torah question they ask me," just as the Tanna Ben Azai did when he stood and lectured in the marketplace of Tiberias, proclaiming that none of the Sages of Israel could ask him a question for which he had no answer. Statements such as these also fall under the category of things that are permitted to be said for the purpose of spiritual benefit, allowing others to envy his wisdom and aspire to attain it [Kiddushin 20a].</i>
However, it would seem that safeguarding [human dignity] that is appropriate according to one’s true worth without being misleading is not arrogance at all and, on the contrary, is a fulfillment of a positive commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Positive commandment:</b> This can be found in <i>Chovat Halevavot</i>, “The Gate of Submission,” Chapter 9. There, he writes that praiseworthy pride is “the pride of the wise man in his wisdom or of the righteous man in his good deeds when it is an expression of his gratitude to the Creator for helping him greatly on them, and of his joy in them. When it causes him to improve and continue exerting himself in them, and …”</i> Halachic authorities are of the opinion that it is forbidden to relinquish human dignity even in the face of a commandment. The fact that the Torah permitted one to passively suspend a biblical commandment for the sake of human dignity and that the Sages considered it sufficient cause to even actively suspend their decrees is sufficient precedent. <sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Is sufficient precedent:</b> See Tractate Berachot 19–20, where it states and brings examples of the concept that “Great is human dignity, as it overrides a prohibition in the Torah.” For example, the Gemara discusses the timing of burying the deceased in relation to the recitation of the Shema. According to a baraita, it is generally not permitted to take the deceased out for burial during the time of reciting the Shema; they should be buried later. However, if the burial procession has already begun, those participating in the procession do not need to stop to recite the Shema. The Gemara raises a contradiction, citing the case of Rav Yosef, who was taken out for burial during the time of Shema. The resolution is that for important individuals, the Sages make an exception and are more lenient to honor them at their burial. This is also seen in the opinions in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 13:3, “Magen Avraham” and “Taz.” There, the Shulchan Aruch writes that if someone realizes that their Tallit (prayer shawl) is invalid while they are in a Carmelit area (where it is rabbinically forbidden to carry) on Shabbat, they should not remove it until they reach their home, because showing respect to others takes precedence. The Rema adds that even if it is a tallit katan (a small Tallit worn under clothing) and one of the tzitzit (fringes) becomes invalid, they do not need to remove it. If they feel embarrassed to sit without a Tallit, they can continue wearing it without reciting a blessing, out of consideration for human dignity.</i> A person can measure his human dignity according to his status and circumstance, as long as his traits are appropriate and he is able to judge himself without error.
It is stated concerning this, “Do not covet honor in excess of your schooling,”<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">[Avot 6:4.]</i> meaning what you are accustomed to, as customary honor is human dignity. But a person should be careful not to be enticed to try to ascend to lofty levels in order to thereby merit more honor based on his new circumstances or to attain more honor than he deserves in his current circumstances. These are two corrupt aspects, each one being grave in its own way.
For it is despicable for a person to desire and covet honor in excess of his current circumstance and without it occurring to him to better his circumstances. This will almost never lead him to any sort of perfection that would bestow honor on him because from his perspective, he already has the honor of which such perfection would make him worthy. But by foolishly expanding his soul like the netherworld [<i>sheol</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayahu 5:14, “Assuredly, Sheol has opened wide its gullet And parted its jaws in a measureless gape; And down into it shall go, That splendor and tumult, That din and revelry.”</i> his days will be filled with anger and pain, and even the members of his household will not accept him.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Bava Batra 98a.</i> But this trait [of being enticed to try to ascend to lofty levels in order to thereby merit more honor based on his new circumstances] is [at first glance] not completely destructive, as there is some benefit, for this will lead him to strive slightly to attain more perfection.
However, this perfection, by contrast, will [eventually] be corrupted by its wicked motivation and will cause great harm. For when a person enlarges his soul<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avot</i> 5:19, Mishlei 28:25.</i> to constantly ascend to higher levels, there is no end or limit, and his craving will never be satisfied. There is no limit to all the ways he can invent to obtain his desire or to the degree to which this vice can overwhelm his soul, corrupting it and dooming it to eternal ruin by distancing it from the light of truth.
Therefore, it seems that a person should initially train himself not to covet a level that is above the state that he is in whatsoever. Afterwards, he should investigate the means of attaining honor in his current situation, examining how much is appropriate and obligatory and how much is excessive and forbidden. It would seem that different cures need to be used to remove these two vices from a person’s heart, since the natures of these vices are different.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Natures of these vices are different:</b> In summary, true understanding of a person’s self-worth based on their current spiritual status and circumstances does not fall into the category of arrogance. However, one must be cautious not to desire excessive honor beyond what one deserves or to constantly seek higher levels in order to acquire more honor. For these two activities will eventually lead to spiritual ruin.</i>

Section 5

<b>E. The prohibition of placing a stumbling block in front of a blind person [<i>michshol lifnei ivver</i>] in the context of attributes</b>
In my humble opinion, it seems that there is a prohibition of placing a stumbling block in front of a blind person in terms of attributes as well.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><b>In terms of attributes, as well</b>: In the final paragraphs of this chapter, Rav Kook, using a wide array of Talmudic and halachic literature, proposes that the prohibition of <i>lifnei ivver</i> applies to inducing negative character traits in a person to the same extent it does to facilitating other forms of prohibited actions. Specifically, Rav Kook uses the "kol vachomer" argument to prove that, since the Sages instituted decrees and preventative measures even in terms of appearance of wrongdoing [<i>marit ayin</i>] concerning attributes, they should institute other preventive measures as well, including <i>lifnei ivver—</i>prohibition of placing a stumbling block. "Kol vachomer" (קל וחומר) is a term used in halachic jurisprudence that means "light and heavy" or "a fortiori." It is a type of logical reasoning by which the truth of a proposition is inferred from a weaker case to a stronger one, or vice versa. When using a kol vachomer argument, if a certain rule or outcome applies in a less severe situation (the "light" case), it can be inferred that the same rule should undoubtedly apply in a more severe situation (the "heavy" case). Conversely, if a rule applies in a more severe situation, it can be inferred that the same rule applies even more so in a less severe situation. Therefore, if <i>marit ayin</i>,<i></i> a “light” prohibition, is included in character traits, then <i>lifnei ivver</i>,<i></i> a “heavier” case, should also be included.</i> I heard it taught by a great man<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><b> Great man:</b> The great man being referred to is Rabbi Yisrael Salanter, the founder of the “Mussar Movement.” His thoughts on this topic can be found in the work “Tnuat Ha-Mussar,” Volume One, pg. 281 and Volume Two, pg. 191.</i> that there is no prohibition of placing a stumbling block in front of a blind person in terms of attributes, but I do not know why this should be so.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Should be so</b>: This opinion of Rav Kook is also found in the work <i>Orchot Tzadikim</i>, Gate 14, “The Gate of Envy,” where it is written as follows: “The early Sages used to pray, ‘May we not have any envy against others, and may others not envy us!’ Now why would they pray that others should not possess this quality more than other evil qualities? But this is the explanation of the matter: — Many men cause others to envy them and covet their possessions. Therefore, the early wise men used to pray that others do not envy them because of anything that they, the Sages, were responsible for. And the Torah has said, ‘Nor put a stumbling block before the blind.’”</i> After all, there is a prohibition of placing a stumbling block in front of a blind person in terms of bad advice.
However, in terms of attributes, this is not entirely conclusive, as the law concerning placing a stumbling block in front of a blind person is that whenever it is possible to assume a permitted motive, we do so, and we see that a case of doubt is not included in the prohibition of placing a stumbling block in front of a blind person.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><b>In front of a blind person:</b> In Tractate Avodah Zara 15b, it is clarified that when there are two possible interpretations of a particular action, one suggesting it is permitted and the other indicating it is prohibited, the preference is given to the permissive interpretation with regards to the principle of "placing a stumbling block before the blind." Consequently, it was deemed permissible to sell large livestock to non-Jews, who might work with it on Shabbat, as we can say that the buyer acquired the cow for the permitted purpose of slaughtering it rather than intending to use it for agricultural purposes during Shabbat. Similarly, Hillel permitted the sale of a cow designated for agricultural work during the Sabbatical year to someone suspected of not observing the laws against plowing. As in the previous case, this leniency is based on the possibility that the buyer acquired the cow for the purpose of slaughtering it rather than for agricultural purposes during the Sabbatical year. Therefore, this action is not considered placing a stumbling block.</i> This is true even in a case where it is the less likely scenario, as the majority are intended for plowing; nonetheless, it is possible to assume that it was purchased for slaughter. That being the case, so long as it is not known that this [action] will lead to a prohibited [character] trait, it is possible to assume a permitted outcome. And even if it tends to lead to a trait that is mostly negative, there are always means of using any given trait in a positive fashion. Therefore, one can say that he will utilize it in a positive manner, and we can assume a permitted motive.
However, in a case where it is clear to us that by inciting someone to a trait that is mostly utilized negatively, he will also use it negatively, it is certainly an absolute prohibition to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Absolute prohibition to do so:</b> [From Rabbi Yaakov Moshe Charlop (Shlit”a) [Zt”l]: Our master and teacher, the Rav [Kook] Zt”l, said that later that he had been unable to find mention in any work on the prohibition of placing a stumbling block in front of a blind person in the context of attributes other than in the book <i>Pele Yoetz</i> (in the section devoted to the letter Dalet, in the entry concerning speaking in praise of another).]</i> It is the same as any other prohibition in the Torah, where we are commanded to distance another person from transgressing the prohibition and it is forbidden to bring about anything that will lead him to transgress it.
After all, the first chapter of Bava Batra relates that Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakai did not inform people about his dream out of concern that it might lead to their performing a commandment in a less than ideal way.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Less than ideal way:</b> The passage in the Talmud (Bava Batra 10a) recounts that Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai had a dream in which his nephews would incur a loss of 700 dinars during the year. To prevent this, he donated the same amount to charity on their behalf throughout the year so that their "imagined loss" would be channeled toward charitable purposes, sparing them from an actual financial loss. However, Rabban Yochanan was 17 dinars short of the desired goal. Later, the king's officials came and demanded exactly 17 dinars from the nephews as taxes at the end of the year. When his nephews feared that the officials might continue collecting taxes from them, Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai comforted them and revealed his dream, explaining how his act of charity saved them from incurring a greater loss. When asked why he had not disclosed the dream earlier, he responded that he wanted his nephews to fulfill the mitzvah of charity with pure intentions, without being motivated solely by the desire to avoid financial loss.</i>
Similarly, we find that the Sages instituted decrees and preventative measures even in terms of appearance of wrongdoing [<i>marit ayin</i>] concerning attributes. If so, this should certainly be true of [instituting] other preventative measures [to distance a person from negative character traits], since the prohibition of appearance of wrongdoing is a less severe preventative measure. This is clear from the statements of the halachic authorities at the beginning of the laws of meat and milk concerning almond milk and chicken.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Almond milk and chicken:</b> In this case, it is permitted to eat chicken with almond milk, and there is no worry about the appearance of wrongdoing [<i>marit ayin</i>]. Therefore, if (as has been seen) the Rabbis have instituted the prohibition of the appearance of wrongdoing [<i>marit ayin</i>] regarding character traits, they should institute other preventative measures as well.</i> We also find the issue of appearing gluttonous,<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">[Berachot 39b.]</i> as we see from the Talmud’s question in the chapter “Keitzad Mevarchin,” concerning breaking off one large piece from the loaf. It answers that since every other day he does not do so … [therefore, it is clear that the person is acting in this manner to fulfill a mitzvah.] Were it not for that, it would be forbidden because it appears gluttonous.
Similarly, they instituted various decrees concerning the appearance of arrogance. They even decreed that one should suspend a biblical commandment passively because of the prohibition of the appearance of arrogance. Nowhere else do we find such a decree to suspend a positive commandment because of the appearance of wrongdoing, which is less severe than other decrees. [An example of passively suspending a biblical commandment because of the prohibition of the appearance of arrogance can be found in the following Talmudic dictum.] A groom who wishes to recite [Shema]<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">To recite Shema: According to the Mishnah in Tractate Berachot, a newlywed groom is exempt from reciting the Shema on the first night of his wedding. This exemption is due to his preoccupation with fulfilling the mitzvah of marital relations with his spouse. Since he is engrossed in these thoughts, he may not be able to focus properly on the recitation of the Shema, which requires the appropriate intention and concentration [Berachot 17b].</i> because he knows that he is capable of recitation and is not preoccupied and that it will not prevent him from rejoicing, according to the opinion that one who is engaged in fulfilling a commandment is only exempt from another commandment if he cannot do both of them, is exempted by Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel and even forbidden from reciting by virtue of the fact that not everyone who wishes to take up the name of God may do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">May do so: According to Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel, even in a situation where the groom says he can have the proper concentration, he is forbidden to recite the Shema. This is because if the groom is allowed to recite Shema when others cannot, it might have the appearance of arrogance.</i>
This being the case, certainly other preventative measures and probably decrees are obligatory. But the matter is left up to each person’s heart to determine his path and see the salvation of the Lord, blessed be He.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">[Moed Katan 5a.]</i>

Section 1

<big><strong>Self-Evaluation [<i>cheshbon hanefesh</i>] in Divine Service and Organization of Its Levels</strong></big>
<b>A. The nature of self-evaluation</b>
The essence of self-evaluation is for a person to deliberate intellectually on every aspect of his soul and his obligation in terms of service of God,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In terms of service of God: In this chapter, Rabbi Kook explores the significance of self-evaluation as part of developing and strengthening positive character traits. The paragraphs that follow offer practical guidance on how to engage in this self-examination.</i> may He be blessed. But one must not forget that this evaluation is not one of imagination but rather of pure, clear reason. In every discipline that there is, it is impossible to deliberate on it without first having clear knowledge of at least its major aspects. Only then can one derive accurate conclusions. So too, for self-evaluation to be possible, it is necessary that one first clarify the requisite knowledge so that it is clear in his mind and etched into his heart. He will then be able to contemplate it without becoming overly weary when he sets out to evaluate himself, for he will have what he needs for the evaluation.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Needs for the evaluation: In all academic and research fields, it is essential to have a genuine and clear grasp of the fundamental principles and basic concepts to effectively analyze and draw conclusions. Similarly, achieving the desired outcome of self-evaluation requires a well-organized and comprehensive understanding of how to conduct this assessment. These insights should not be limited to theory but should be practically applied in one's life. Only after this initial intellectual clarity is grasped can the self-evaluation be carried out accurately, ensuring that the person has the necessary foundation and preparation for the successful completion of the assessment.</i>
It seems that there is a common error of viewing that which is incidental as innate—this being the way of the evil inclination—causing a common reaction following the [beginning of the process of self-] evaluation and a person’s subsequent thirst for truly correcting his ways based on the will of the Creator, blessed is He. When he sees how far he has deviated from the path of holiness, he becomes weary and withers, and his heart is saddened and weakened. While none of [these feelings] are inherently good, they are nonetheless a result of the clarification of wisdom and knowledge brought about by his self-evaluation.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">By his self-evaluation: This means that a person is initially weary and disheartened by facing the reality of their distance from God and the necessity of perfecting their ways.</i> The soul’s perfection tends to [eventually] discard these deficiencies, namely, weakness, excessive shame, and especially sadness and faint-heartedness.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Sadness and faint-heartedness: [See <i>Iggrot Re’iyyah</i>, Volume II, pg. 262.] In this letter, Rav Kook explains the dangers of faint-heartedness and sadness as follows: “From the teachings and wisdom of the great Torah scholars of the world, it is known that sadness is among the forbidden traits, included in the category of negative attributes along with anger and arrogance. I have already observed numerous times among the students of the yeshiva that mental and physical irritability, arising from the negative trait of nervousness, confuses one's mind, diverts a person from the path of their Creator, and deprives them of the delight of the Torah and the joy of serving the Almighty.”</i> Therefore, these will spur the soul and motivate it to pursue the path of goodness and righteousness.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The path of goodness and righteousness: Although feelings of shame and sadness may not be inherently positive, they play an essential role in the soul's process of self-evaluation. It is important to note that excessive weakness, overwhelming shame, and particularly deep sadness and a broken heart are seen as deficiencies that hinder the soul's completeness. However, feeling these emotions will ultimately guide the soul to distance itself from sin in the future, helping it avoid such situations. Consequently, the body will awaken and strengthen the soul, leading it to choose the path of goodness and righteousness. Thus, the weakness felt during times of self-evaluation should not be viewed as the ideal state but rather as a temporary and accompanying phenomenon that will eventually pass.</i> For a person who uprightly and righteously walks in the way of the Lord, blessed be He, will not weaken but rather will be girded in strength and splendor. He will not be ashamed<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">[By the lowliness of shame mentioned above, such as in one who sins and is embarrassed about it or a person who partakes of another’s food and can’t look him in the face (Yerushalmi ‘Orlah I:3). The negativity of this shame was instilled in the basic intent of man’s creation and the manner of its governance (<i>Pitchei Chachmah V’daat</i>, 1).]</i> but rather will exalt in the honor with which the God of all souls, may He be exalted, crowned him. He will not be sad, for rejoicing in the Lord is his strength. His heart will not be weakened, for the name of the Lord is a tower of strength for the righteous who walk upright.
However, those who approach the way of the Lord, blessed be He, wanting to travel the paths of the obligations of the heart without study, which must precede action, will err concerning this [above] principle. They will think that weakness and sadness are innate to self-evaluation and pure reverence. However, the soul will not take kindly to that which is contrary to its nature, and, therefore, this will cause depression and will not add service or wisdom.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Not add service and wisdom: When individuals fail to intellectually differentiate between their essential nature and the transient emotions that accompany the process, their self-evaluation may lead to feelings of depression and despondency rather than motivation to put in extra effort and enthusiasm to further their spiritual journey.</i> Concerning this, it says,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">[Kohelet 10:15, Midrash Rabba, <i>Chovot Halevavot,</i> in the section on Monotheism, Chapter 2, Ibn Ezra and Rashi.]</i> “A fool’s exertions tire him out, for he does not know how to get to a town.”
One should, therefore, study, learn, and delve into the roots of reverence based on the depths of the statements of our Sages, of blessed memory, and based on reason with which the Lord, blessed be He, graced man, just as we do in the case of all the laws of the Torah, where we deliberate their details using refined reason. However, one should not rely on his own understanding in order to reach the depths of the details of the wisdom of the soul, which is one side of the study of divine service, especially since its other side is the divine wisdom dealing with global providence, whose major principles are numerous and extremely difficult. Nonetheless, the Lord, blessed be He, did not entirely deprive man of wisdom .<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">[See Iyyov 39:17.]</i> If a person relies on the words of our Sages, of blessed memory, and investigates the depths of their words, he will also discover much through his own intellect, based on their paths.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">His own intellect, based on their paths: This was explained in Rav Kook’s introduction to this work regarding the obligation for a person to compose their own personal Mussar Sefer to achieve spiritual completeness by realizing their unique path in <i>Avodat Hashem</i>.</i>

Section 2

<b>B. Self-evaluation in thought and deed</b>
In the first chapter of the section of <i>Chovot Halevavot</i> concerning self-evaluation, the author states that we are commanded to engage in self-evaluation, that is to say, an intellectual self-inspection with respect to our [religious, moral, and spiritual] obligations. This is derived from the text that states: “Know therefore this day and keep in mind that the Lord alone is God in heaven above and on earth below; there is no other.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 4:39</i> The meaning is as follows: Although the evaluation relates largely to actions, and, ostensibly, this verse does not refer to actions, “in heaven above and on earth below” alludes to the notion that, since there is no other in heaven and earth besides Him, may He be blessed, and since there is “no other in heaven,” everything intellectual should be devoted to His honor, and since there is “no other on the earth,” every earthly action should be devoted to His honor.
This is indeed an important matter that a person must take note of. For sometimes a person perceives the splendor of the Lord, blessed be He, to a certain degree through deep contemplation and misleads himself into thinking that the only means of divine service is through mental epiphany,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 3, Section C: “Arrogance and humility and the depths of their roots in the heart and soul.”.</i> God forbid. Indeed, this idea needs to be uprooted from one’s heart, as it is extremely damaging.
It is true that a person need not avert his eyes, and that which he imagines in terms of the splendor of his Creator, blessed is He, is sacred and exalted. However, all of the practical minutiae and Torah study concerning the fixed halakhot are the essence of divine service.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The essence of divine service: Certainly, a person cannot disregard the uplifting experiences that arise during their contemplation of spirituality and mental epiphany. However, it is crucial to note that the lack of a sense of holiness in practical halachic practice is often due to the impurity of the soul. In reality, true devotion to God finds its highest expression in engaging with specific actions related to fulfilling the commandments and diligently studying the Torah and its laws. Once a person purifies themselves and actively strives to fulfill God's will, they come to realize that actual deeds of <i>Avodat Hashem</i> hold greater significance than mere intellectual contemplations about the Divine will.</i> Even if they do not evoke any epiphany, that is only because he is not yet trained and has not yet been sanctified to cleave to His will, may He be blessed. But once he succeeds in attaching himself to His holy name, then whenever he begins to do anything that fulfills the will of God, may He be blessed, all contemplation and wisdom being merely means to arrive at the fulfillment of His will,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See the beginning of Chapter 1.</i> he will immediately realize that, since he is engaged in fulfilling His will, there is nothing comparable to this level.
All of this is based on the evaluation that on the earth below there is also nothing besides Him. A person will know that He, may He be blessed, desires all that is good, and anything evil is actually rebellion. He should observe the fact that when we refrain from acting contrary to the will of someone important, it is a function of our inner will, not our body. If so, how is it possible to act, even in the slightest, against the will of the Master of everything, all life being nothing more than an expression of His great will, may His name be blessed?<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">May His name be blessed: Therefore, in order for a person to not err and act against the will of God, they should be constantly engaged in intellectual self-inspection with respect to their religious, moral, and spiritual obligations.</i>

Section 3

<b>C. Organization of levels in terms of perfection and service</b>
It has already been said by the sage<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">By the sage: [See <i>Mivchar Hapeninim, Mitzvat Hachacham</i>.] The Spanish sage, Rabbi Shlomo ben Yehudah Gabirol (1022–1070).</i> that apprehension never departs from one who wishes to ascend to a level that is beyond him. This principle has both a general and a particular aspect.
The general aspect is that a person cannot find peace because they have not attained that [higher spiritual] level, which is distant from them. This is a vice, which is only found in a person because of their lack of knowledge, as this sadness and lack of self-satisfaction is a result of the person failing to make the effort to understand what the level that they demand of themselves is and what its true definition and requirements are. Were the person to contemplate these matters, their soul would already shine with the light of this knowledge. It would be perfected by means of the light of joy and satisfied contentment,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">[See above, 1:8.]</i> as the paths leading to attaining the circumstance of the desired perfection would already be revealed to them. Once a person reaches a paved road, their distress ceases, even though they have not yet reached their destination. But since they do not know what they seek, no path for enlightening themselves spiritually can be revealed to them, and the person sits in darkness, sadness, and despair.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Sadness and despair: A person's inability to find peace and satisfaction is often linked to their failure to reach a higher spiritual level, which seems distant due to their lack of knowledge. The sadness and dissatisfaction they experience arise from not understanding the true essence and requirements of this desired level. If individuals were to engage in introspection and seek understanding, their souls would be illuminated with joy and contentment, and the pathways to spiritual growth would become clearer. However, without attaining this knowledge, they may find themselves in spiritual stagnation and sadness.</i> Therefore, a person should take the time to reflect on what they seek in order to perfect themselves and on what path will allow them to succeed in achieving this. Once the person investigates this, the Lord, blessed be He, will open the gates of light for them, as “Good and upright is the Lord; therefore, He shows sinners the way …”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">[Tehillim 25:8.]</i> Therefore, the person will never covet a level that is beyond them, because if they recognize the level and know its aspects and requirements, it is no longer beyond them. But so long as the person does not contemplate it to understand the content of what they seek and only pictures it in its inchoate form, it is possible for them to seek that which is far beyond their reach, causing them to be anxious and sad. Even a level that is not beyond their reach, were they to [take the necessary time to] clarify that which they are seeking, will be beyond them, since they are not investigating it [properly], and this will cause the person anxiety.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Cause the person anxiety: A person should constantly engage in introspection to determine their goals for self-improvement and the path to achieving them. By understanding the spiritual level they seek and its requirements, they can avoid coveting unattainable goals. When one investigates and clarifies their aspirations, the path becomes clearer, and the anxiety and sadness stemming from unattainable aspirations or attainable aspirations that are not fully understood are alleviated.</i>
The particular aspect [of apprehension] is that a person should not demand from any action or study or thought to evoke for themselves any self-images of loftiness or sanctity beyond what they have prepared themselves for. While it is proper for a person to desire that their self-image be elevated, one should not be overcome by worry out of the fear that if they cannot comprehend such a self-image then, they will not attain any sort of perfection through action.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Perfection through action: When individuals aspire to higher spiritual levels, beyond their current state, they often engage in self-persuasion, convincing themselves that they are suitable for those elevated levels. Their intense focus on aligning with these aspirations may unintentionally hinder the emergence of new and holier thoughts, which are more practical to acquire, as they have not prepared themselves for such possibilities. Consequently, their strong efforts to internalize the higher spiritual level may lead them to believe that unless they feel that the level is fully integrated within them, they haven't achieved complete perfection in their actions.</i> In fact, fulfilling the commandments and studying the Lord’s Torah are so exalted that they perfect the soul far more than any perfection that a person can picture. They are themselves the true perfection. The bottom line is that as long as a person seeks to walk exclusively in the way of the Lord, blessed be He, to perform the commandments and diligently study the Torah and to sanctify themselves below [in this world], and similarly in terms of prayer, to attune their will to prayer and the meaning of the words, they will ascend and receive assistance from heaven to grow in the Torah, wisdom, and good deeds. But a person will rob themselves of the joy and happiness of divine service and will find many obstacles on the path to perfection if they wish to experience exalted levels in their prayer and instantly feel a profound attainment and tremendous pleasure, for they will be incensed and unable to calm down. The same is true in terms of Torah study [a person will rob themselves of the joy and happiness] if they want to attain new knowledge and many insights every time and in each topic [they study]. And it is similar in terms of good deeds if they only want to feel enlightenment in their heart and mind.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Enlightenment in their heart and mind</b>: While it is natural to desire personal elevation, one should not be overly anxious about not comprehending such lofty ideals, as true perfection comes from fulfilling commandments and studying the Torah. If a person seeks immediate profound spiritual attainments or constant new Torah insights without the proper preparation, it will hinder their joy and happiness in divine service and impede their path to perfection.</i>
[Furthermore,] there are certain things that are virtues and tend toward holiness, but when a person is drawn to them without knowing and possessing the proper progression and protocol by which they need to be approached, these very virtues can turn into obstacles.
The sanctity of a Jew’s soul makes them capable of attaining the level of divine inspiration [<i>ruach hakodesh</i>] in the following sense:<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">[See <i>Tikunei Zohar</i>, 21: Rabbi Shimon arose; the Vilna Gaon, ad loc.]</i> being able to grasp clear and true matters without the effort of searching out axioms and deriving conclusions a drop at a time. Rather, the mind and intellect will always be full of new insights, like a constantly flowing spring, and these will be intelligently ordered and organized wisely.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Organized wisely</b>: This spiritual attainment involves acquiring Torah knowledge and insights, not through gradual and systematic learning but rather by intuitively grasping the truth from the general to the specific categories. In such a state, the person’s mind becomes like a flowing spring, effortlessly achieving well-organized and profound intellectual understandings.</i> When a person reaches this level of divine inspiration, this tendency is holy and good, since they are already filled with the chambers of the Torah, and all the thoughts incorporated in them are encased in sanctity and true wisdom. But as long as a person is empty of Torah, as is my status as a result of my many sins, then when this desire to think thoughts from the depths of the heart is aroused, great care must be taken. For the emotions and intellect are not yet sufficiently refined to the point where what emanates from them is actual Torah. Therefore, a person must be careful not to partake of this attribute prematurely.
[Another example of spiritual learning rooted in holiness that can potentially become harmful when not properly manifested is] arrogance, which is rooted in the exalted nature of a person’s soul. Indeed, a person who has the potential for greatness in Torah and fear of the Lord such that they are obligated to be concerned for the honor of the Torah to the proper degree will naturally start acting in that manner even before they have reached the level where it befits them. For this person, this is [prohibited] arrogance. The matter requires clarification and study to determine precisely how the matter should be dealt with.
Therefore, a person should evaluate what their true worth is and the nature of their desire for perfection and train themselves to understand each issue. A person should incline their ear to listen to words of the Torah, and each and every word of the Torah should be dear to them as if it were new and given at Mount Sinai today. They should address their prayers to the Master of all deeds to set their path in search of truth, and then they will go securely on their way.

Section 4

<b>D. The development of abilities, in terms of the individual and the Jewish nation</b>
We see in nature that every inherent ability whose nature is to act will inevitably do so. When it acts, it will do so in one of two ways: If circumstances are such that its action is ordered so that it is directed toward perfection and a desirable telos, then it will act positively. If, however, it does not act in accordance with proper order and the telos, then its movement will cause evil and destruction. This applies both to something that had the ability to act in a great and ordered way but was robbed of the means to do so before it reached completion and to an ability that already accomplished great and proper actions but was later robbed of the means to sustain its activity.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Means to sustain its activity</b>: When an ability is directed toward perfection and operates within the framework of its intended purpose, it results in positive actions. However, if it deviates from the proper order or loses the means to sustain its activity, it can lead to negative consequences or even destruction. Therefore, it is of the upmost importance to maintain the proper alignment with the intended purpose to ensure positive and constructive outcomes.</i> This is a major fundamental principle in the ways of evil and loss<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Evil and loss</b>: This understanding, relating to the consequences of mismanaging a natural force, provides valuable insight into the core principle underlying the Torah's admonition to differentiate between the impure—<i>Tamae</i>—and the pure—<i>Tahor</i>. A person who has become impure due to contact with a corpse or carrion must avoid contact with sacred items. According to the explanation of Rav Kook, this is because such impurity represents a life force that was cut short before reaching its full potential in action. Likewise, this is the reason why the different discharges originating from the human body lead to impurity, as they signify unrealized potential of life force.</i> in the cases of the impurity of a corpse and carcasses and impurity emanating from a person’s body.
We can learn from this that if a person has a special ability, he must actualize it fully to the degree possible, otherwise he has not only failed to use it constructively but also caused disorder and major damage regarding all of his conduct. On the other hand, as soon as he acts to perfect it, the ability follows its natural course of perfection and stops acting destructively. All the more so in terms of all the generic abilities that man possesses. A person is certainly obligated to actualize their perfection such that they all function in the right time and place according to their ability and in accordance with the guidance of the Torah through the understanding of the intellect.
Therefore, a person is obligated to inspect himself and discover which unique abilities are instilled in him. He must not discard any potential that he detects within himself. Rather, he should examine how to utilize each one properly and certainly not ignore those abilities that are blatant, negating and ruining them by not assigning to them their proper and organized place and service. For his abilities are the Lord’s work and are very powerful. They will not allow their territory to be encroached upon.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><b>To be encroached upon</b>: Since a person’s character traits will eventually reveal themselves, a person has a duty to self-reflect and identify their unique abilities. One should not overlook any potential within themselves but instead explore how to use each ability effectively and properly.</i> It will not be good when they act without a leader, like a ship without a captain.
This [rule of not discarding any potential] applies to the general perfection of the nation as well. When an ability is not actualized appropriately, it causes tremendous damage. We, the sacred seed of Israel, need to realize how many obstacles we face because we do not utilize our tremendous abilities,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Do not utilize our tremendous abilities:</b> Here, as in many of his other works, Rav Kook addresses the rise of secularization and heresy among the Jewish people. He explains that because there are great powers within us that do not manifest properly in action, the youth are going astray to try to find a foreign outlet for their souls.</i> which the Lord, blessed be His name, gave us. We have the potential for great wisdom, sacred might, holy song, greatness, and exalted humility, to the exalted highest level of wisdom, prophecy, and divine inspiration.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">[The Vilna Gaon, in his commentary on Aggadot regarding the emperor asking Rabbi Yehoshua ben Hananiah how long a snake is pregnant before giving birth, explains that prophecy was taken from us in exile, but the Sages said that God speaks to us in dreams, which is a sixtieth of prophecy. So too, sleep in exile is a sixtieth of the world to come, and the return to Zion is like dreaming, as it states in the Zohar.]</i>
If we do not make the effort to actualize these tremendous and incredible abilities (despite being detached from us and completely inert in terms of their sacred roots because of our sins, our vital souls are nonetheless fashioned for these high and important paths, and our bodies have the potential to receive this greatness), then because we are not lent a hand to guide them properly so that they can find the task that they seek, they do the opposite, and as a result of our sins, rot will replace perfume.
Therefore, we need to gird ourselves with strength in accordance with our limited intellect and strength, which fails due to our sins and is weakened by our abundant troubles, the severity of our poverty, and our illusory baseness. By means of the true Torah, we must develop true and great ways to find a place for all of the great abilities that are found within us to be used in the service of the Lord, our God, Who desires our honor and for us to choose good and sanctity. We need to clarify the matter of these abilities well. They are, indeed, hidden within the hearts of many of our people, but these are deep waters, and we need wise people to haul them up and place them before us in full force. This will arouse in us, the sons of the living God, our abilities, spurring each person to investigate which of the great abilities he possesses and how he can utilize them on the sacred path of rejoicing and serenity, not on the dark, gloomy path of despicable sadness or in the confused joy that merely confounds his mind and disrupts his character but rather on the path of attaining truth and knowledge of the true glory, which is the glory of God, Who gave us the great gift of the nobility of holy souls, to declare His deeds among the nations and to know His sacred name.
When this light bursts forth over the earth, even a little, many of our brethren,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Many of our brethren:</b> Specifically, those who at the current time seem far away from a religious and spiritual lifestyle.</i> thirsty for the goodness of the Lord, will flow forth toward the Lord and His goodness. Thereby, the heavenly abilities, which await the moment when we arouse the love, will awaken in their sacred grace, and all their might and splendor and a spirit of counsel and valor will alight upon us, a spirit of knowledge and reverence for the Lord.
