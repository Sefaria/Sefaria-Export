Paragraph 807

Love for [God's] creatures must be alive in the heart and in the soul - a love for each individual person and a love for every single nation, a desire for their spiritual and physical elevation... It is totally impossible to come to the lofty spirit of [the daily recitation of] "Praise the Lord, call out in His name, make known His wonders among the nations," without an inner love from the depths of the heart and soul to do good to all of the nations, to improve their wealth and to enrich their lives. This characteristic is that which uniquely qualifies Israel to have the spirit of the Messiah dwell upon it.

Every person is able to enrich the world with his particular spiritual powers, if he is capable of revealing them. One need not be  of the wise or be a teacher, for even a simple person can do this, for there is no set limit to the richness of the natural inner depths of the soul, which is the light of God in this world.

When a person wishes to be a complete Tzaddik, it becomes difficult for him to become a Baal Teshuva. Therefore, it is better for a person to always aim at aspiring to be a Baal Teshuva, immersed in ideas of Teshuva, aspiring towards their practical manifestation, and then his Teshuva will be able to raise him up to the heights, to the level of a complete  Tzaddik, and even higher than that.

Expanses, expanses. Expanses divine my soul craves. Confine me not in cages, of substance nor of spirit.  My soul soars the expanses of the heavens, walls of heart and walls of deeds will not contain it; morality, logic, custom.  My soul soars above all these, above all that bears a name, above delight, above every delight and beauty, above all that is exalted and ethereal.  I am lovesick.

Paragraph 280

I thirst, I thirst for G-d, as a deer for watered brooks.  Alas who can describe my pain?  Who will be a violin to express the songs of my grief.  Who will voice my bitterness, the pain of seeking utterance.  I thirst for Truth, not a conception of Truth, for I ride on its heights. I am wholly absorbed by Truth. I am wholly pained by the anguish of expression.  How can I utter the great Truth that fills my whole heart?  Who will reveal to the multitudes, to the worlds, to the creations, that fill everything, to nations and man at once, to the sparkles filled with treasures of light and warmth, which are stored inside my soul....

 I am bound to the world all creatures, all people are my friends.  Many parts of my soul are entwined with them. But how can I share with them my light? Whatever I say only covers my vision, dulls my light. Great is my pain, and great my anguish. Oh, my G-d, be a help in my trouble; find for me the graces of expression.  Grant my language and gift of utterance.  I shall declare before the multitudes, my fragments of your Truth, oh my G-d.

The wild man thought, that all that he can chew and swallow is nutritious, until experience taught him to distinguish between the harmful and helpful weeds and roots, the nutritious ones and the non-nutritious ones, the tasteful ones and the non-tasteful ones. And all that is happening in the material values is happening in the spiritual ones, except that this study is late to come. And the spiritual savage thinks, that all that is read and written will feed his soul, until he come to distinguish between holy and profane, between the things that give eternal life, and the things that disrupt the course of the true life.

Before my eyes shines the holy torch of the refined and admirable light of the world. The light of Israel - its delights fill the entire universe with holy elevation. From its rivers streams down the powerful quality of life in the power of its pure originality. The lives of high souls are nursed from its springs, from the Splendor of the worlds, from the majesty of Eternity. The lights appear with the pure recognition of divinity, by the refreshment of the desire to be situated in the center of existence in the power of its elevation. The Jewish soul is pressed by the blossoming forth of love that fills the light of its life, which takes up all of its focus. Great raging waves from one end of all the worlds to their other end rage deep within its soul. Purity overpowers purity, eternity overtakes eternity - and the secrets of the Life of the world pushes the cycles of history, so that Jewish history is revealed in the splendor of its colors. It moves and soars in its awesome power towards its supernal action, its holy flight - the holy of holies. But below it small clouds flow, dark lights mixed with shade that draw forth from its nectar, brightened by traces of its light, but darkening and mixing with them, weighing down the souls that become attached to them. For such is how they are in their foundation and thus do they love. And with the descent, many causes of darkness, wild and stormy winds and a misleading bridle upon the jaws of peoples. Yet amidst all the darkness flicker sparks of its splendor.

The thought of the reality of the world strengthens practical precision and adopts the foundation of valor. And conversely, the ideal and visionary depiction of reality weakens the character of valor and places practical content within the idealistic vision. Heresy stumbled on the stumbling block of the gross material reality of the world in the crude form of separation from the unity of divine rule, and it raised itself from practical and real content, wishing to rise to idealistic sublimity, and it stumbled in that the separated materiality overpowered in form and enslaved the idealistic content to it. Thus it defiled the storehouse of every precious vessel, beginning with connection and ending with separation. The Hasidic tendency diminished the reality of the world, and through this practical enthusiasm was weakened and was sublime in idealistic inwardness. Indeed, later on it descended from its completeness to defend the limited practical existence in its world, and it was not similar to heresy, which abhorred the practical from separation that has no healing. The way of Torah is not occupied with taking away the reality of the world, but rather with unity. Divine rule and valor is evident in prominence and clarity, and practical content is extremely precise. And if worlds come in which all is sublime, then all the content of heroism as it is evident in the advantageous sublime tangible creation will shine in the light of great kindness, in which idealistic brilliance resides. And to this storehouse of life all eyes are turned, and it comes specifically according to the multitude of action, and Torah was given to Israel because they are brazen, from His right a law of fire for them, the laws of these are fire.

Great destruction comes to the structures of the soul when the inner light of 'the time for silence' appears, when the fullness of the beautiful glory and heavy burden of the highest holy muteness fills the soul, if one rebels against it and breaks out in speech. This rebellion against the sovereignty of silence destroys all its buildings, all the storehouse of simplicity and rectitude, of depth and transcendent communication - everything shatters in fragments. Afterwards, if one wants to rebuild that which was destroyed, they must establish everything anew, and in that moment a discerning person is silent. In truth when silence is honored in the moment of its appearance, then it asserts its rule, establishes its hall, penetrating to the deepest depths of its abyss and bringing out glorious ramifications and mighty branchings with a powerful and refreshing vital force - the shrubs (sichim) are filled with strength and new expressions of the lips (Is. 57:19) come. Then the time for speech begins, in its beautiful glory, and the spirit of silence serves as the mediating angel that works upon the flood of speech, flowing like a river in all its preciousness and abundant wealth. "I will create new expressions of the lips: Peace, peace, both far and near, says the Lord. And I will heal him. (Is. 57:19) "...Their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing." (Ezekiel 47:12)

Pity, O God, have mercy, O compassionate and gracious God, have pity, grant me the ability to return to You in complete repentance, and bring me back to the Land of Your delight. Let me merit to see the joy of Your nation, to praise You with Your heritage. Have mercy, have mercy, O loving father, have pity now, save us now, O God that saves.


Paragraph 72

My broken-heart and sorrow and my tendency toward depression come from my inability to be satisfied with anything in this world except the illumination of God's light, the manifestation of His pleasant holiness. In times of hiding and concealment - what pain I feel, what bitterness I feel. From the depths I call out to you, O God, "I called aloud to Him, He is exalted on my tongue," (Psalms, 66:17) "In distress, you called out and I rescued you, I shall answer you from the secret place of thunder."

Once can know their spiritual standing by the clarity of their speech.

The particular quality of speech's affect is measured according to the extent of the soul's elevation, each according to their level. 

Paragraph 79

When one speaks of sacred matters, but feels discomfort because of the holy manifestation pouring out within, know that the impure soul is gradually shrinking away. It is this soul which is pained by its reduction, and of its own accord goodness progressively overcomes. Through this very knowledge, through faithfulness to it and delving deeply in it, the pure soul awakens in joy and knows that it she becoming holy, rising up, spreading out more and more. “The LORD is their strength; He is a stronghold for the deliverance of His anointed,” (Psalms 28:8) “…and my heart exulted, so I will glorify Him with my song.” (Ps. 28:7)

When we forget our own subjective soul, when we distract ourselves from looking at our inner life, everything becomes confused and uncertain. And the main teshuvah, that lights up the darkness in an instant, is that one returns to oneself, to the roots of one’s soul, and immediately returns to God, to the soul of all souls, and stride forward up and up in holiness and purity. And this is the case with a lone individual, a whole people, all of humanity, with the restoration of all being, whose ruin always proceeds from forgetting itself. And if it desires to return to God, but isn’t prepared to gather its scattered ones, this is a deceptive teshuvah, taking God’s name in vain. And so only by the great truth of teshuvah to oneself, will a person and the nation, the world and all the worlds, all of being, return to its maker, to light in the light of life. And that is the secret of the light of the Messiah, the coming into view of the soul of the world, with whose illumination the world will return to the root of being, and God’s light will reveal itself upon him. And from the source of this great teshuvah, man will draw the sacred life-force of true teshuvah.

The hatred of wickedness, when it is great and deep, must at firstcome together with hatred of the wicked. Only afterwards can it be sweetened through the power of consciousness and clarified until it takes its clean, ennobled form which is solely the hatred of wickedness, while toward those who carry it, who are the wicked themselves, we are filled with compassion. ‘Let the sins cease and not the sinners.’ (Berachot 10a) If at its inception hatred comes in its ideal form, focusing its essence only on the hatred of abstract wickedness, it will never be actualized in its full strength even as that hatred of wickedness. This is because the lack of hatred for the wicked will blur the hatred of wickedness itself, and then all the storehouse of good will be placed in great danger. This was the stumbling block for many fallen, who fell because from the beginning they employed the hatred of wickedness in its ennobled form, and the absence of hatred for the wicked afterwards was transformed into love for them. And through the love of the wicked they fell into the love of wickedness itself. Therefore, the first thought must be in the quality of the aspect of judgment, and afterwards mercy will come and sweeten it through their union.
