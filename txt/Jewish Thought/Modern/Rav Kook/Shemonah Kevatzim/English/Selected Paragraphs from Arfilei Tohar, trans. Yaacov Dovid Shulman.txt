Paragraph 75

A person may not allow [one’s] fear of heaven to override his natural morality. Were his fear of heaven [to do so], it would no longer be pure. The mark of a pure fear of heaven is that it elevates a person’s natural morality – which is planted in one’s straightforward nature – to higher levels than that which it [could] otherwise stand upon. But if we imagine a fear of heaven of such a nature that without its influence on [a person’s] life, [one’s] life would tend to result in more good and bring about [more] matters that help the individual and the community, and the influence [of that fear of heaven] would diminish this active power – such a fear of heaven is a flawed fear.

Paragraph 476

Heresy’s spirit of smashing through barriers purifies all of the infection that has gathered in the under area of the spirit of faith. As a result, the heavens are purified [so that] the clear light within the character of supernal faith – which constitutes the song of the world and truth of the world – is revealed. 

Kovetz 2



Paragraph 1

Just as [we] must elevate [our] fallen thoughts and traits (in which evil and ugliness may be discerned) to the source of their root in holiness, where we see that they are really exalted thoughts and good traits, so too must [a person] lift up [his] thoughts that are decent but that stand at the lowest level  – where evil and chaos are united with them, even though they face holiness. [He must lift them up] to the most elevated level of the ideal sublime – [a state of being that] is directed only toward total goodness and absolute straightness – until the uplifting [of these decent thoughts] grows and [reaches] the supernal world, over which pure holiness rules in its might.

Paragraph 2

The insolence (chutzpah) at the time preceding the messiah comes about because the world has progressed to such an extent that it demands an understanding of how every detail is connected to the whole. A detail that is not connected to the great whole cannot satisfy [a person’s] mind. If the world were engaged in [gaining access to] the light of Torah to such a degree that [a person’s] spiritual soul [would] grow to recognize the proper connection between details and spiritual wholeness, then the teshuvah and rectification of the world would be actualized. However, because [people’s] carelessness has led to [a state in which] the light of the inner Torah – which requires [that a person attain] an exalted state and an inherent holiness – has not appeared in the world correctly, the demand [of people for the structure of a life in which the details are understood within the [framework of the] whole has come at a time when the complete revelation of the light and the clearing of the path [leading] to understanding has not yet arrived. And this has caused terrible destruction. We must employ the supernal remedy, which is [the attainment of] increased strength in [our] spiritual ability. Then the common people will, [with their] feeling, directly understand and access a way of comprehending and appraising that which connects all of [their] Torah-[related] knowledge and deeds to the most supernal wholeness. At that point, the strength of spiritual life will again appear in the world, in deed and in thought, and a universal teshuvah will begin to bear its fruit.

Paragraph 3

The essence of learning Torah for its own sake can come only after [a person] is capable of [gaining] an understanding – accompanied by feeling – of how all of the details of the Torah are beloved and holy, and of how the universal light, which is filled with life and brings life to the world, courses through all of [these] details.

Paragraph 4

There are various causes of depression. [A person] must overcome all of them with the joy of [performing] a mitzvah. That is a constant joy that suits [the people of] Israel because of the spiritual light that always rests upon them. One cause [of depression] is a tendency,[expressed in] action, for coarse pleasure. A person’s soul is drawn by that to a place of darkness, and [there] it grieves over its descent.[A person] should transform this great woe to joy, for when [his] soul [will] rise from the yoke of exile that had burdened it, a great stream of joy [will] rise up from below, and the sublime, pure [level of reality will] grow ever richer in its spirituality.

Paragraph 5

(One needs to distinguish and differentiate two levels of Divine Providence governing the world.) God’s guidance [of the universe, as] connected to the moral dimension – whether [in relationship to] individuals or to nations and [other] groups – is all an extension of the nature of universal morality poured into the essence of being. This [guidance is alluded to] by the name <i>Elokim</i> (“God”). However, higher than this stands [God’s] concealed free will, which does not correspond to a revealed moral state. Instead, [it corresponds] to the supernal ideal, which is in consonance with the supernal gaze, transcending the conditions of present day existence. The illuminations that come from this state are the lights of the inner soul of all being. They include the past, present and future, transcending the structure and form of temporal periods. All of this is encompassed in the name “<i>Hashem</i>” as it is structured and in all of the pathways of its permutations.

Paragraph 7



Paragraph 8



Paragraph 9



Paragraph 10



Paragraph 11



Paragraph 12



Paragraph 13

The rectification of the political state as a whole and the rectification of [each individual’s] body in particular are part of the highest manifestation of holiness – [a manifestation] so holy that it cannot be illuminated in a revealed fashion by means of a characteristic light that has an obviously holy form. Rather, the light is wrapped within [this manifestation of holiness] and [clings] to it like a garment. The noble strands that emerge from these [rectifications are] practical details directed toward the rectification of the state and [of each individual’s physical] health, in the form of Godly commandments. These may be compared to <i>tzitzit</i>. And the culture as a whole may be compared to the <i>tallit</i>. The <i>tzitzit</i> bring forth a holy revelation of all of the light hidden in the entire <i>tallit</i>, with [the light’s] great revelation and manifestation. [Similarly, the] deeds of Godly commandments and holiness that make [their particular] mark in the totality of human action, [deeds] directed toward rectifying [man’s] life – communal and individual –actualize the light hidden in the depths of all the structures of human culture. They bring the revelations [of that light] to the place fit for [the light] and make visible the light of eternal life that gives life to everything, including temporary life.

Paragraph 14



Paragraph 15



Paragraph 16



Paragraph 17



Paragraph 18



Paragraph 19



Paragraph 20



Paragraph 21

The <i>nefesh</i> of the sinners of Israel in the era preceding the coming of the Messiah – of those who connect with love to matters concerning the entirety of the Jewish people, the land of Israel and the renaissance of the nation – is more perfected than the <i>nefesh</i> of those fully faithful Jews who lack this quality of an intrinsic sensitivity to the good of the whole and the building of the nation and the land. But the <i>ruach</i> is much more perfected in those who fear God and who keep the Torah and the commandments, even though an intrinsic sensitivity and impulse to act in matters concerning the whole of Israel are not yet as strong in them as they are in those in whom a spirit of transgression fouls their heart to such a degree that they connect themselves to foreign perspectives and to deeds that pollute their physicality and prevent the light of the <i>ruach</i> from being rectified [in them]. As a result, the <i>nefesh</i> [of these sinners] too suffers from their blemishes. The rectification – which will come about via the light of the Messiah [and] which will be greatly aided by the spreading forth of the teaching of the secrets of the Torah and the revelation of the lights of the wisdom of God in all of its forms that are worthy of being revealed – is that Israel will come together in one bond. And [then] the <i>nefesh</i> of those who are [God-]fearing, who keep the Torah, will be rectified by means of the perfected <i>nefesh</i> of the sinners, who are good in regard to matters of the entire [community] and [in regard to] the hopes, material and spiritual, that can be understood by human awareness and sensitivity. And the <i>ruach</i> of the sinners will be rectified by means of the influence of those who fear God, who keep the Torah and who are great in faith. And thus a great light will come to both [groups]. The manifestation of complete <i>teshuvah</i> will come to the world, and then the people of Israel will be prepared for redemption. The supernal <i>tzadikim</i>, the masters of the <i>neshamah</i>, will be the unifying conduits through which the abundant flow of the light of the <i>nefesh</i> will pass from left to right and the abundant flow of the light of the <i>ruach</i> from right to left. And the joy will be very great. “Your priests will don righteousness and Your pious ones will sing joyfully” (Psalms 132:9). And this will be accomplished through the power of the light of the Messiah, who is David himself, who “lifted up the yoke of <i>teshuvah</i>” (Moed Katan 16b). “For the sake of David Your servant, do not reject the face of your anointed one” (Psalms 132:10).

Paragraph 22

The more a person loves people, the more that one gazes with an approving eye at those who are immersed with all their might in matters of this world and its construction, the more one’s mind becomes settled. If one is capable of turning to the heights, to a supernal spirituality, to Godly perceptions, one will [then] find oneself more at home in his supernal world. The necessary affairs of the world that are incumbent upon humankind [and] that by their nature interfere with the supernal vision will not disturb that person so much, because he or she will know that these are being attended to on his behalf by all of those people who find satisfaction in this practical work of theirs. Ben Zoma said of this: “Blessed is He Who created all of these to serve Me” (Berakhot 58a).

Paragraph 23



Paragraph 24



Paragraph 25



Paragraph 26

There is no room to ask about the source of a person’s knowledge of supernal information. When we find within the soul a supernal spirit and a treasury of well-arranged knowledge – so that everything is aligned with everything else – [we may know that] this is the pinnacle of clarified [knowledge]. All knowledge that derives from analysis is merely a means of attaining this supernal knowledge, which the soul pours forth from its deepest depths. The most effective means of attaining this supernal trait is clinging to God with all of one’s might and studying the secrets of the Torah.

Paragraph 27

The light of Israel shows how it is precisely the yearnings that transcend the entire world that give the world life and happiness. Eternity is necessary not only for the sake of eternity but also for the sake of the moment. And the moment is important because it is one of the revelations of eternity. The world is important because it is one form of the infinite numbers of forms through which the light of the Divine Being is revealed.

Paragraph 28



Paragraph 29



Paragraph 30

At times, when there is a need to disregard words of Torah but there is no one in the generation who can show the way, the matter comes about by means of a disruption. At any rate, it is better for the world that such a matter come about by means of an error. In this inheres the principle, “Better that people [do wrong] in error and not with purposeful intent” (Beitsah 30b). Only when prophecy is present in [the nation of] Israel is it possible to institute such a matter – by means of a temporary injunction. Then it is done openly, with permission and as a Godly command. But in consequence of the sealing of the light of prophecy, this rectification come about by means of a [longlasting] disruption that, although it dismays the heart from the aspect of its outer being, causes it to rejoice from the aspect of its inner being.

Paragraph 31



Paragraph 32



Paragraph 33

Holy people must truly be natural people, for whom all the qualities of the nature of body and spirit partake of the quality of life and health. And then in their ascent they are able to raise the world – and all will rise with them.

Paragraph 34



Paragraph 35



Paragraph 36



Paragraph 37



Paragraph 38



Paragraph 39



Paragraph 40



Paragraph 41



Paragraph 42



Paragraph 43

A person’s instinct is swifter and more exact than his or her intellectual recognition. A human being’s greatness [lies in the fact] that one can raise all of one’s recognitions to the heights of the most supernal aspect within instinct – from which comes exactitude and swiftness. In regard to a supernal, exalted [state of being], those people who truly possess divine faith have the mightiest instinct. [In this regard,] all culturally-focused people will ultimately return to them. [But] in terms of intermediary goals – such as yearning for morality, knowledge, the building up and honor of the [Jewish] nation, and so forth – culturally focused people have the strongest instinct. Everyone who has a strong instinct [in some matter] is weak in those [other] matters that require [him to engage in] calculation and deliberation. Therefore the [various] strata of the [Jewish] nation must be bound together so that they will receive illumination of knowledge and strength of instinct from each other, in accordance with the level of the particulars of how these portions are divided among them.

Paragraph 48



Paragraph 49

Paragraph 56



Paragraph 57



Paragraph 58



Paragraph 59



Paragraph 60



Paragraph 61



Paragraph 62



Paragraph 63



Paragraph 64



Paragraph 65

Just as supernal holy people have no connection to mundane and trivial concerns, and [their] trait of holiness is beyond any [this-worldly] purpose, so that it goes without saying that [a holy person] eats in order to learn [Torah], pray, perform mitsvoth and the like-this being an intermediate trait –  [furthermore,] the essence of [the holy person’s] eating and similarly [that person’s] speech and all of the movements and emotions of life are filled with holiness and light. And how much more is it the case that for these people all wisdoms in the world – whether deep or superficial, pure or impure – have an intrinsic [upward] direction, and everything that enters into the circle of their awareness rises as they rise. It is true that, in practical terms, no one reaches this level, for the Torah has set eternal boundaries [barring certain behaviors] for everyone. But in regard to that which pertains to [the realm of] thought, “boundaries are no higher than ten [handbreadths]” (Shabbat 43a), “there is no Satan and no evil occurrence” (I Kings 5:18), and “even the Angel of Death teaches [such a person]” (Shabbat 89a).

Paragraph 66

In the days preceding the coming of the Messiah, whoever connects in the inclination of one’s heart to the salvation of Israel possesses the soul of a supernal holy person, which cannot be gauged with the measure [meant] for an intermediary [person].


Paragraph 67

Torah sages are perfected by means of the unlearned masses – for even though the light of the Torah constitutes the life of all [people], nevertheless it is also “a drug of death for those who turn leftward with it” (cf. Shabbat 88b), and it reduces the strength [of sages] much more than if they had been lacking Torah and [only] simple nature had acted upon them in the pathways of their lives. And since all people have a component of ugliness, however small, the Torah indeed becomes harmful to them corresponding to this component. And in this area – the harm is incomparably stronger than the reward. And the counter-remedy to the drug of death blended into the Torah sages is activated by the general connection that they have with the unlearned masses of the entire [Jewish] nation, for in this way the latter pour forth the influence of [their] natural straightness, which has not been at all degraded by means of any sophistry. [Then] the small drop of the drug of death turns back again into a drug of life. And in this way it also gives life to the entire people, including among them the unlearned masses.


Paragraph 68

[Regarding] the impurities in [people’s] understanding of divinity, awe, faith, and everything dependent upon these – as long as the nation as a whole has no need to rectify the ways of its practical life, the damage [that these impurities cause] is imperceptible. But since the time has come that the national revival must arrive, and the blossoming of the “horn of salvation” in actuality must be revealed, [these] impurities immediately create an obstacle. The nation can only bond together, and, in the depths of its life, understand the secret of its might and the images of its structures by means of purified perceptions and actions that emerge with the highest clarity from [people’s] pure, true knowledge of God. This is why a great negative force is aroused [at the time] preceding the coming of the Messiah, [a force characterized by] great insolence. That negativity will burn away all that is weak and ugly in Godly concepts and [all] that depends upon [those concepts], in the whole of the nation. Even though this is terrible to see – because a number of matters of truth, good traits, commandments, and laws seem to be swept away by the stream of negativity –  nevertheless, everything will ultimately blossom in purity and might with exalted holiness from the seed that is powerful, pure, and exalted, which no negativity will [be able to] reach. Its light will shine as a new light on Zion, with a wondrous greatness beyond any image that the impoverished powers of weary souls – [suffering from] material and spiritual weakness resulting from the long and debilitating exile – can visualize.


Paragraph 69



Paragraph 70



Paragraph 71



Paragraph 72



Paragraph 73



Paragraph 74



Paragraph 75



Paragraph 76

I love all. I cannot but love all people, all nations. From the very depths of [my] heart, I want the glory of all, the perfection of all. My love for Israel burns more greatly and is deeper, but [this] inner desire spreads out in the force of its love to all, literally. I have no need whatsoever to force this feeling of love – it wells directly from the holy depth of wisdom of the Godly soul.


Paragraph 77



Paragraph 78



Paragraph 79



Paragraph 80



Paragraph 81



Paragraph 82



Paragraph 83



Paragraph 84

By its fundamental nature, [a person’s] consciousness of God flees a blemished, splintered and incomplete life for a life that is whole, outstanding, and full, even in this world. One spark of the light of God that lives in a person’s heart suffices to expel infinite instances of darkness. Those who say that the knowledge of God diminishes the character of life are fools without understanding who are standing on the outside. And a nation that knows its God must appear in the world with the knowledge of the on-going perfection of life in light of the living God.


Paragraph 85



Paragraph 86



Paragraph 87



Paragraph 88



Paragraph 89



Paragraph 90



Paragraph 91



Paragraph 92

Personal understanding of divinity can be encapsulated in <i>zeir anpin</i> (reduced size) [which concentrates one’s views of] God as unique, the Creator of all, [Who has made] the world and all beings with the work of His hands. But this understanding is small, and there exists <i>arikh anpin</i> (a broader state) [of comprehension that is] much greater than this, and that incorporates everything into a supernal and wondrous unity, exceedingly higher than the above mentioned personal thought.

When a person sins, that person is in the world of separation. At that point, every element stands alone. Evil is evil in itself, with an evil and harmful quality. [But] when a person does teshuvah out of love, the light of the existence of the world of unification – where everything is organized into a single unit – immediately shines upon that person. And in [that] universal connectedness there is no evil at all, for the evil combines with the good in order to season it and elevate its precious worth even more. And with this, “willful sins are transformed into merits” (Yoma 86b) – literally.

Paragraph 107

The insolence (chutzpah) at the time preceding the Messiah is [the expression of] a diminution of light, which has the purpose of rectifying the vessels. It is not at all similar to other, [previous] instances of criminality, which were entirely empty, [acting] in a destructive manner. However, within this camp of the insolent there are also sparks that must be entirely extinguished. And that extinguishing will come about as a result of a great illumination of the light of the Torah from supernal might, by means of the appearance of very great tzadikim. “The light of the righteous will rejoice, and the candle of the wicked will be extinguished” (Proverbs 13:9).


Paragraph 108

Without the insolence preceding the Messiah, it would be impossible to explain secrets of the Torah with an absolute revelation. Only due to the coarsening of feelings that results from this insolence (chutzpah) is it possible to receive very exalted intellectual lights. And in the end, everything will return to [a state of] complete rectification.

Paragraph 109



Paragraph 110



Paragraph 111

The feeling of love must develop in all of its details so that it will display all of its treasures of intellectual, emotional, and imaginative vitality. Then the treasury of God will rise to the heavenly love that is associated with the name of HashemGod. Similarly, the aesthetic sense must overall be so well developed that the soul can gird itself with the image of heavenly beauty, such that it will be able to stand at its highest levels. The literature of the [present] generation and the desire for the expansion of beauty that has taken hold of [the generation] – even though these tend toward mundane matters and are at times extremely polluted – are nothing else than preparatory levels for the supernal purity of the exalted glory that will appear in the world.

Paragraph 112

To provide a contrast to those studious people who are scrupulous about constant perseverance [in Torah learning], it is necessary that a faculty be found that shows how the free, inner light may be revealed through [a person’s] perambulations and tranquility, [which provide] a breadth of mind through which [one’s] soul rises, soaring in “a vehicle that flies through the air” (Sanhedrin 106b), where it looks for all of its desires, seeks its refined concepts – seeks and finds them. [Our] generation, which is so weakened by the torments of body and soul, requires the influence of serenity, for only that will bring about an inner perseverance, which will influence to a proper degree the outer perseverance as well, aligning it with the faculties of the body and spirit – and [it does so] in a way that develops all of the [generation’s] hidden ability, with a proper and assured development, until [that development] will emerge to provide a blessing for each individual and for the world.

Paragraph 120

When set against the supernal, divine truth, there is no difference whatsoever between imagined faith and heresy. Neither gives the truth. But from our perspective, faith comes closer to truth and heresy to falsehood. And therefore good and evil are derived from these opposites. “The righteous will walk in them and the sinful will stumble in them” (Hosea 14:10). And the entire world, with all of its physical and spiritual levels – everything relates to our level [of reality]. In regard to our level, truth is revealed in faith, and that is the source of good. And falsehood [comes] through heresy, and that is the source of evil. But in relation to the light of the Infinite One, everything is equal. Heresy, too, is a revelation of the power of life, for the light of life of the supernal radiance clothes itself in it. And therefore spiritual warriors gather very good sparks from it and transform bitterness to sweetness.


Paragraph 121



Paragraph 122



Paragraph 123



Paragraph 124



Paragraph 125



Paragraph 126

When [our] divine enlightenment is small, then the image with which we imagine Divinity is also small. And since the character of divinity makes clear to a person his infinite smallness, the extent to which he becomes a groveling good-for-nothing as a result of a fear of heaven that lacks intelligence cannot be imagined. How can a person attain an estimation of the divine greatness in such a way that the inherent form of the beauty of [his] spirit will not be blurred but broaden? [He does so] by means of his faculty of knowledge, by means of the liberation of his imagination and the soaring of his thought, by means of [his] knowledge of the world and life, by means of [his] wealth of feeling regarding all being. For this, a person must truly study all the sciences of the world, all ideologies of life, all the ways of the various cultures and the content of the morality and religion of every nation and language. [Then,] with a greatness of spirit, he will know how to purify them all. Obviously, the entire foundation of his knowledge as a Jew [must] be built upon the foundation of the Torah, in its most absolute breadth. And he [must] strive always so that his pathway will not be constricted and his perceptions will not be narrow and fragmented but proceed with breadth and in an assured manner. He [must] not bear many fears, which would prevent [his] intellect from doing its work and [his] spiritual faculties from pouring forth their influence. He must be courageous. He must know the might, the good and the evil, and the supernal origin from which everything flows in an orderly form – [a form] that gains perfection with his perfection. And then, in accordance with his soul’s greatness, the divine light will shine upon him, his spirit will be great, and the supernal divine humility – which expands all of [a person’s] talents – will fill all of his inner being, and a heavenly might will strengthen him always. And he will do wondrous things for himself and for the entire world.

Paragraph 127



Paragraph 128

It is proper to yearn to be bound to the entire nation of Israel. The more that a person purifies his thoughts and deeds, the more can he connect to the highest and smallest levels of the entirety. If there is smallness and preponderance of judgments [within him], the connection will be less inclusive. [And then,] if there is a lesser amount of connection with the most degraded level, there will be a lesser amount of connection with the greatest of levels. [This is] because complete perfection is connection with the complete entirety – whatever the manner and [to whatever] measure.


Paragraph 129

A great soul yearns to spread over everything, over all stages, to stretch its feet to the end of all rungs – in order to give life to everything, to draw everything close, to raise everything. To the extent that it stretches forth its feet, it lifts up its entire stature and grows. And with its elevation, it attains supernal levels. Great and mighty kindnesses appear before it. It straightens out all pathways. But smaller souls come and prevent it from stretching forth its feet. They press down its stature. It suffers, shrinks and comes apart. At times, it does the will of those who obstruct [it], shriveling within a narrow circle. [But] its eyes are lifted up to illuminate everything – including those who obstruct [it], including all strata above and below. It is filled with hope [that reaches] to the ends of the world, to an inheritance without boundaries, to the inheritance of Jacob, to the heights of the land (cf. Isaiah 58:13 and Yalkut Shimoni, Jeremiah 496).

Paragraph 130



Paragraph 131



Paragraph 132



Paragraph 133

Morality will not stand without its source. [That] necessary source is an infinite light that has been rectified [in accordance] with the manifestation of the universes. When morality without its divine source is consigned to people’s hearts, it is diminished and it wilts. Since morality comes to the world by means of divine conduits, it will always make [the world] fruitful. And since the means that connect human thought and [humanity’s] feelings with the unbounded and alltranscending divine light must exist in a variety of hues, the pathways of spiritual life are therefore different in every nation and established grouping. But the organizing, uniting matrix must necessarily vanquish and encompass everything. “God will be one and His Name will be one” (Zechariah 14:9).

Paragraph 134



Paragraph 135



Paragraph 136



Paragraph 137



Paragraph 138



Paragraph 139

There is a quality within the particular individuality of every person that is higher and more elevated than [the quality] of the communal nature that exists in the nation. That supernal individual aspect illuminates and gives life to the entire nation. In accordance with the elevated level of the individual, and in accordance with the number of individuals on a high level, the nation is elevated a very great deal in terms of its communal level. And that communal elevation is entirely in alignment with the most perfect individual greatness.


Paragraph 140



Paragraph 141

Our temporary existence is a single spark of eternal existence, of the splendor of the utterly eternal. The only way to actualize the treasury of goodness hidden in the content of [our] temporary life is by aligning [our temporary life] with eternal life. That [alignment] is an inner recognition that permeates the spirit all of existence. Not all the spiritual battles will succeed in moving [that recognition] from its place. [To the contrary, they] completely clear the roads before it. Even that which opposes [that recognition] is, in the depth of truth, supporting it. 

Paragraph 142

Eternity is the mighty basis of all cultural life in its fullest sense. The aspiration for the glory of eternity conquers death and wipes away the tear from every face (cf. Isaiah 25:8).

All descents of supernal tzadikim [righteous individuals] from their glory, from their station, from their health, and from their supernal spirituality occur only because [these tzadikim] have abandoned slightly the intensity of their supernal trait of kindness. As a result, they are affected by the pollution of the world, which is filled with harsh strictures and accusations. Instead, they must – since they are the “foundations of the world” (Proverbs 10:25) – always sweeten all of the bitterness and illuminate all of the dark places.

The essence of hearing the voice of God is that we take heed of the entire process of the ways of life in all of their details – [as applied] to general [national] groups in accordance with the differences between them, and [as applied] to each individual on his or her level – [as that process flows from] a universal, supernal wisdom that is alive and gives life to all being. The more clearly that the details flow from the spiritual, supernal, inclusive life – which is the wisdom of the soul of God in the world – the more a person clearly hears and listens to the voice of God speaking to him, teaching him and commanding him, literally. “I am Hashem your God, Who teaches you for your advantage, guiding you upon the path that you should go” (Isaiah 48:17).

Paragraph 183



Paragraph 184

When people think about divinity, at times [their] thought proceeds in a form that negates the world. That is to say, [they think] that the divine form in its greatness, in its might, in its holiness, in its beauty, in its vigor, in its infinite being, nullifies existence entirely, [so that] everything is considered as nothing, absolutely nothing. That is the thought which comes from might, and which is clothed in its trait [of might]. But there is another, more refined form [of a person’s thought]: that the divine thought perfects the world, giving all of existence its true worth. From this aspect of [a person’s] thought, whose source is kindness, [one’s] love of the world and of all creatures grows ever stronger, [to the degree that] all of the fullness of [one’s] divine love and lucid thinking on divinity grows full and takes up more space in the world. In this, the thinker is not separated from the world but raises the world to the supernal Eden, to the divine youthfulness and exaltedness.

Paragraph 185



Paragraph 186

At times, [a person] cannot engage in [learning] Torah, nor in any [good] deed or mitzvah, nor in any worldly activity, because [one’s] will to be connected to the supernal form of the pleasant, infinite light gains in intensity. [One] must then proceed step by step so as not to be separated from this holy yearning, which is the foundation of all and the most supernal enlightenment, which gives life to all human culture and to all of the hues of the various universes in all of existence. Instead, a person must rectify [this] great light by rectifying the vessels [that are to contain it] and drawing down [good, heavenly] desires (in the form of “lines” and “points”) that will be in alignment with [one’s] Torah thoughts, manner of [performing] mitzvahs, [and the way in which one proceeds upon the] pathways of life in this world in all areas of this-worldly behavior. With this, a person causes the world to be inhabited by a supernal holiness.

Paragraph 187



Paragraph 188

Trivial matters can be elevated only by means of the revelation of secrets of Torah. When the revelation of the light of supernal secrets comes in a strong flow, [then] all of the lowest elements are elevated, [so that] there appears within them the light hidden in the depths. And so in the days preceding the Messiah, “the wisdom of the scribes will rot” (Sotah 49b), and many trivial matters will proliferate, in the form of literature and social life. [Then,] as a result of the revelation of the light of the Messiah, all of them will be transformed to holiness. “Its fruit will be for food and its leaf for healing” (Ezekiel 47:12).

Paragraph 189



Paragraph 190

[When a person suffers from] a smallness of faith, it appears [to that person] that when people strive to strengthen their [this-worldly] situation, to fight against the problems that occur in the world, to acquire knowledge, might, beauty, organization – that all of this is external to the divine content in the world. Thus, a number of people who believe that they stand upon a divine basis are suspicious of all worldly progress. They hate culture, the sciences, political strategies – whether among Jews or non-Jews. But this is all a great error and a lack of faith. The pure outlook sees the divine appearance in every improvement of life: individual and general, spiritual and physical. It measures matters only according to the level of the usefulness that they have or the damage that they cause. Any movement that engaged in constructive creation, whether physical or spiritual, will never be an entirely negative movement. It may have imperfections, but everything in its totality is an element of the divine creation that is constantly acting. “Not chaos did He create it, but that it be inhabited did He make it” (Isaiah 45:18).

Paragraph 191

There are certain rectifications of the world that cannot be accomplished by tzadikim but only by wicked people and people with blemished views and deeds. It is true that with teshuvah out of love and a great effort to increase holiness in the world [making use of] the straight prayer of tzadikim, the tzadikim can also take part in these rectifications – which, in the general course of things, come forth only from the hands of wicked people and those far from holiness. These rectifications include societal improvements (such as tools of agriculture and war, some of which the world greatly needs, practical inventions) as well as others that are spiritual improvements involving various technical and intellectual sciences – into the details [of all of which] a soul crowned with piety and a spirit uplifted to holiness cannot penetrate. Only via the great ascent of the spiritual process can [we] attain this supernal blessing of having all the rectifications of the world brought about by tzadikim and holy people.

We have a tradition that a spiritual rebellion will take place in the land of Israel and among [the people of] Israel in the period of the beginning of the renaissance of the nation. The physical tranquility that will come to a part of the nation, who will imagine that they have already attained their entire goal, will diminish [their] soul. And days will come “of which you will say, ‘There is nothing desirable in them’” (Ecclesiastes 12:1). The yearning for elevated and holy ideals will entirely cease, and therefore the spirit [of the people] will descend and sink, but then a storm will come and bring about a revolution. Then it will be clearly apparent that the strength of Israel lies in eternal holiness, in the light of God, in the Torah, in the desire for spiritual illumination, which is the absolute might that conquers all of the worlds and all of their powers. The necessity for this rebellion is the tendency toward the aspect of materialism that must of necessity come into being in the nation as a whole in a powerful form, after periods of many years have passed in which the nation as a whole was completely devoid of the need and ability [to engage in] the material endeavor. And when this tendency is brought into existence, it will trample with wrath and create whirlwinds. These are the birth pangs of the Messiah, whose pains will refine the entire world.

Faith with which intellect does not agree arouses anger and cruelty because the highest aspect within a person, which is [one’s] intellect, is affronted by it. But as for supernal faith – although it is very much concealed, [consisting of] the wondrously hidden ways of God, these [ways] possess within themselves such great pleasantness that the anger that was stirred up as a result of [one’s] suppression of [one’s] intellect is immediately nullified. [That anger] is itself transformed into great sweetness and pure light because of the divine manifestation that unites with it and [then] descends to the lowly faith, which [in turn] bonds with [a person’s] healthy intellect in the revealed world. [Then] the hidden world and the revealed world come into alignment with each other, and together they build the house of Israel with a doubled beauty. “He will bring forth the main stone, as people cry out before it, ‘Beautiful, beautiful!’” (Zechariah 4:7).

Paragraph 289



Paragraph 290

When one truly looks at the good aspect of every individual, one falls in love with people, with an inner affection. And one has no need to rely on the slightest trace of flattery, for [one’s] interest in the aspect of the good that one always encounters truly conceals all of [people’s] bad aspects. “An intelligent man conceals shame” (Proverbs 12:16).

“I am in the midst of the exile” (Ezekiel 1:1). The inner, essential “I” – whether of the individual or of the community – appears within [an entity] only in relation to its holiness and purity [and] in relation to the degree of its supernal power suffused by the pure light of an elevated illumination, flaming  within it. “We and our forefathers sinned” (Psalms 106:6). Adam sinned. He was alienated from his essence. He turned to the consciousness of the serpent and lost himself. He did not know how to give a clear answer to the question, “Where are you?” (Genesis 3:9), because he did not know himself, because he had lost [his] true “I,” with [his] sin of bowing to a strange god. [The nation of] Israel sinned. It “ran after foreign gods” (Deuteronomy 31:16). It abandoned its essential “I.” “Israel rejected goodness” (Hosea 8:3). The earth sinned [during the week of Creation]. It denied its essence. It constricted its power. It went after [limited] goals and purposes. It did not give forth all of its hidden power so that the taste of the tree would be equal to the taste of its fruit (Sukkah 35a). It raised its eyes to look outside of itself, to think about [its trivial] future, its “career.” The moon complained [at that time] (Hullin 60b). [As a result,] it lost its internal orbit, the joy of its portion. It was dreaming of a superficial beauty of royalty. Thus does the world continue to sink, with the loss of the “I” of every [entity] – of the individual and of the whole. Learned educators come and focus on the superficial. They too remove their consciousness from the “I.” They add straw to the fire, give vinegar to the thirsty, and fatten minds and hearts with everything that is external to them. And the “I” grows progressively forgotten. And when there is no “I,” there is no “He,” and how much more is there no “You.” The Messiah is called “the breath of our nostrils, the anointed one of God” (Lamentations 4:20). This is his might, the beauty of his greatness: [that] he is not outside of us. He is the breath of our nostrils. Let us seek Hashem our God and David our king. Let us tremble before God and His goodness. Let us seek our “I.” Let us seek ourselves – and find. Remove all foreign gods, remove every stranger and illegitimate one. Then “you will know that I am Hashem your God, Who takes you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am Hashem your God” (cf. Numbers 15:41).

As the spirit of freedom grows more at home in the world, life is refined and everything is filled with a [good] will. Then the holy feeling of appreciation for the good is powerfully aroused and leads to a Godly, exalted manifestation, which is connected to the joy and fulfillment of life. “All of the sacrifices will cease, except for the thanksgiving sacrifice, which will never cease” (Midrash Rabbah, Tsav 9:7). Rather, [the thanksgiving sacrifice will draw] from the essence of all of the sacrifices that will cease to rise straight upward with tremendous strength.
