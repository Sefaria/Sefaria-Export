Kovetz 1



Paragraph 1

We live [in concert] with the spiritual images [that exist] in the aspiration of [our] nation’s soul.
These [images] are sparks of light. We are connected—with the connection of the soul of life, [the connection] of all of our being—to every place [these images] are hidden: whether that is a literal place (a site on earth), whether [that “place”] consists of [people’s] actions at whose foundation these images are hidden, or whether [that “place”] consists of [people’s] thoughts and ideas, of whatever category they may be.

Paragraph 2

A person who comes to slash these branches, to diminish their power, their honor, and their importance to us, diminishes the richness of our lives, and we must rise against him with all our might.

Paragraph 3

In the totality of the written and the transmitted, [oral] Torah and the interweaving of all of its particulars is hidden the most elevated and core spiritual image of the desire of [our] nation in terms of the goal of its highest life—an image that glows in the totality of its comprehension and its breadth, its logic, the styles of its expression, the outcomes of its perspectives—regarding existence, Godliness, the world, humanity, the individual, society, good and evil, life and death.
The more that Torah understanding and recognition are manifest in [our] nation, [the more] is [our nation’s] soul within it well-founded, and [the more] its power of life rises up and grows splendidly strong.

Paragraph 4

And [our] actions are the physical basis, the tangible element, in which this great theory, [this glowing image,] places its treasures. And the more the value of [our] theoretical understanding grows, the more the light hidden in all [of our] actions shines in the midst of the [entire] nation.
And [then] the might of the trait of beautiful harmony within practical Judaism for [the sake of] God is revealed.

Paragraph 5

Sometimes life stumbles in its course and lacks the strength to proceed with the spiritual images. Then [our] spirit is too weary to crystallize them into deed.
Then confusion is born and viewpoints sunder.
Those who have a hardy spirit say: Life is susceptible to illness, but it is also susceptible to return to complete health. And whatever is joined to life is secure.
Therefore, we will not abandon the banner, the precious ideals that are hidden in the alcoves of deeds. [These ideals] will necessarily come to light precisely as a result of having been crystallized into deed.
These deeds are not yet completed, they have not yet reached their goal, when we will be able to say that they have completed their work.
They must illuminate the entire darkness of life. But [that] darkness is still great and extremely vast.
Therefore, we will not abandon the banner. We will carry and bear [it]. With actual deeds, we will give form to the great thought of the spirit of Israel, just as [our] nation began doing from the time that it began to see its collective life.
And if the burden is heavier now than it was in previous days, it is worthwhile bearing the yoke for the sake of the goal.
We have left behind the circle of nations, children with capricious minds, who tire of [taking] serious actions that do not bring immediate gratification. We are blessed with knowledge and a fullness of personal feeling, so that we know how to live and how to carry the yoke of life for the sake of a worthy goal, with a calm heart and mighty will. Although [that goal] is still hidden, in the end it will be revealed.

Paragraph 6

We aspire [to attain] the supernal goal and, correspondingly, to hold onto the practical foundation. The practical burden is waiting [to receive] the full power [it needs, which will occur] when the ideal light is revealed in it and through it.
But with that, the [burden] may, over the course of time, because of the stumbling of the nation, become too much.
Then we will seek proper solutions that are in keeping with the spirit of the soul of the nation itself [and] in keeping with the way of the Torah in its fullness, in order to ease the weight in such a way that this necessary alleviation will not even for a moment cause any lack of the spiritual image in the actions [that express the nation’s] aspiration.

Paragraph 7

When we damage ideas, when we distance ourselves—as a result of immersing [ourselves] in the smallness of routine life—from the elevation of supernal thoughts, which create deeds that are great and contain hidden within themselves powerful Godliness, [those] deeds become damaged.
Their level sinks and their glory is dimmed, until they are revealed in an unruly form that arouses irritation and barrenness, whereas before their natural garment was might and glory.
And when the deeds are damaged, ideas grow distant, until they become a sort of weak thought, which arouses the disdain of every man of action because it is so far from life and has so little strength to affect [life].

Paragraph 8

To find a remedy for this terrible situation [of damaged deeds], for such a disease, which consumes the two extremities of life, so that at the core [the situation] is parched, we must strive as much as possible to guard [our] deeds, to love them and reinforce them to the extent that we can—but not to be satisfied with that.
We will not gain anything in our effort if we do not commingle with the elevation of [our] deeds the return to the soaring idea that is stored and hidden in them.
When actions remain “commandment of men learned by rote” (Isaiah 29:13), not only are they unhelpful, but they will diminish the idea even more.
And in the end, the diminishment of the idea will conclude in [the person] abjuring [his] deeds with disgust.

Paragraph 9

We will not at all be disconcerted by those who frighten us against the flight of thought, by those who say that we are brazen to rise to the heights of the heavens without a ladder.
That is not so. We have a ladder set on the ground, whose top reaches heaven: the light in our souls, in the soul of the all and the soul of the individual, that will be capably awakened by the light of the secrets of the Torah.

Paragraph 10

Regarding matters of concepts and beliefs, which are founded on spiritual, abstract matters, it is more common than in any other dispute that two disputants who, viewed externally, are very far from each other, are really both saying the same thing.
And the whole core of the dispute, which sometimes appears to flame to the heart of heaven, is only a dispute of language, because neither person understands the other’s language.

Paragraph 11

Regarding the basis of beliefs, everything depends on the quality of the intertwining of thought, how its parts depend on each other, in which there is a great difference between one person and another—and, even more, between one generation and another.
Sometimes, as a result of some thought about some fundamental concept, one person experiences a complete structure of ethics and holy feelings, and it doesn’t touch another person at all in the spiritual structure in which his soul lives.
And sometimes, the one selfsame idea causes one person to sink and descend, and another to rise and ascend.

Paragraph 12

The wise person improves his concepts so that they will be organized for him in a proper way.
Regarding the spiritual concepts that fill a person’s spirit, the more that he is illumined by his thought, the more the general form [of his concepts] is correct and the closer it comes to the truth and to the quality that elevates [his] spirit.

Paragraph 13

The Rambam was happy when the construct of [God’s] providence took on, for him, the character of gradation—[i.e., the idea that the level of His providence corresponding to a person’s] sapience.
And it is fitting to be happy about this, because as long as faith [in providence], which provides the basis to life in the world, exists without an intellectual framework, it does not blend with all of the waves of life of the spirit of wisdom, which yearns to comprehend.
But after [faith] has received its intellectual form, it is rooted in the depths of a person’s soul in all of its rooms and depths, and he finds himself content, as his spiritual form coalesces into a single unit.

Paragraph 14

From the depths of the concealment of the soul, we will take the light that will revive the entire nation and set it on its feet.
The power of life grows stronger, it blazes its pathways. But we must study the content of its spirit.
The yearning for a supernal, holy spirit—a holy spirit that emulates the spirit of the men of might girded with the power of God, whom we had in earlier days when the nation knew itself—is growing stronger.
As it shines forth, it breaches fences, it obliterates forms of ordinary guilelessness and piety. Apparently the situation is terrible, razed, with neither [guilelessness] nor [piety].
But all of that is merely a passageway. We must immediately approach the supernal brilliance of the light of life that pours forth from the elevated source, exalted from the beginning, to imprint with its power a new and sturdy form, better and more filled with the might of holiness than anything that a middling guilelessness and a stumbling piety could provide.

Paragraph 15

The ideals at the source of Israel are increasingly revealed. With the essence of the thunder of their power, they give life to the spirit prepared to receive them. And they demand [to attain] their role: that vessels be prepared for them, many vessels, [these being] healthy souls of a fresh generation that lives upon its land and is girded with the might of the salvation of His right hand.

Paragraph 16

The Sanctuary, prophecy, and sovereignty, and all of their ceremonies, send their beams to us, their light that is seeded in the land of life.
Rays come from them to us, waves of their light beat upon our eyelids, which have been closed throughout the entire course of time of the exile, which fragmentizes everything.
We are summoned to prepare for the light, to know what we are and what our purpose is, what our soul, with all of its strength, demands of us.

Paragraph 17

The great and elevated spirit that yearns for the greatest of the great—it, and only it, grasps life and humanity in its splendor and its might.
The only thing that parallels the might of a complete life—which fills bodies that are filled with healthy blood and tremendous power, with enormous energy and an immense joy of life—is the might of the spirit in its supernal vigor, shining and rising over humanity with the power of the strength of Israel, which grows ever more apparent in our lives as it bursts forth now in the stream that bends toward the establishment of the nation on its historic soil.

Paragraph 18

Without a goal [leading] toward the power of life, [a person’s spirit] continuously melts, its strength diminishes and collapses, it wears away and strides toward disintegration, which is right before it on a downward incline.
But the power of life that is crowned by the whole, by the community of the nation, appears with its proper goal right before it in our lives, in our meaningful lives, and for the sake of that we live, exist, battle, and prevail.

Paragraph 19

Illusion comes as a result of [a person’s] propensity [to engage in] exalted inquiry when [that propensity] bursts forth before its time, before it has acquired its necessary preparations—that is to say, before it has sufficiently learned practical, specific teachings, which [must] always precede exploration into the supernal and the elevated.
As a result, [this inquiry] has not attained the foundation for its full moral stance sufficient for the person’s [proper] stance. [It has not yet reached] an exaltation that suitably parallels an inquiry filled with light and personal strength, such as inquiry into the Divine in its sublime form.
That is why we always find that, following [a person’s] propensity toward being inspired to seek that which is exalted, illusion comes—an illusory faith or an illusory heresy. And it is all due to “students who have not served their full apprenticeship,” who rise to the heights of exploration without first having been prepared.

Paragraph 20

It is a great spiritual endeavor for a person to open himself so much that in his inner being he recognizes God’s closeness to him.
[Then,] when this inclusive propensity has been thoroughly awakened, all of the avenues of [his] life are straightened.
To [attain] this end, it makes no difference what means a person will use to gain closeness to God: whether it will come through [his] intellect and logical recognition or through the way of [his] inner feelings—as long as he will recognize the might and truth [of that closeness].
The commandments overall and prayers are the best tools to expand a person’s propensity toward closeness to God and to broaden its steps in his depths.
Therefore, the value of every prayer [recited] with intent, every blessing and praise [of God], every mitzvah and every good custom, is very great and exalted, [because] these are the means for every human being to lay a solid foundation for feeling close to God in [his] heart.
How wretched are those people who do not know Hashem, who have not prayed and who have not performed the commandments with the entire congregation, the community of Israel.
The preparation in the soul [of the nation] that demands closeness to God seeks to bring [those wretched people] in as well. But because they do not fulfill their obligation to themselves, they remain wretched, dry of all dew of purity, even if they bring the moisture of good deeds in order to fulfill their natural moral thirst. [Fulfilling] the need [for morality] cannot satisfy what [they] lack from the standpoint of the need, the demand, to be close to God. That is fulfilled only by [performing] Godly deeds that are dedicated to the name of Hashem, with holy speech [of prayer] and performing Hashem’s commandment and directives.
With pity, the pity that we must have on all mankind, and in particular on our children and those close to us by family and spirit, we are inspired to straighten before them the straight road [that leads] to closeness to God. That [closeness] is acquired by means of the Torah: by learning it and keeping it.
And the more we attain this elevated goal, [i.e.,] the greater the increase of good and pure deeds that by their nature lead to planting closeness to God into the power of life, the more will happiness grow in the world.

Paragraph 21

A person’s power of faith [that makes it possible for him] to heed well and receive that which has been transmitted exists in him for the sake of his general and specific development.
This ability stands [ready] to fulfill what [he] lacks—that is to say, to bring into his spiritual treasury illuminations that are intrinsically higher than he is, so much so that he cannot gain benefit from their light.
Those weak in intellect, who recognize the smallness of their spiritual ability—[the fact] that they are not fit to judge matters satisfactorily—are graced with a power of faith more elevated that [that of] those [people] mighty in knowledge, who feel their strength to know with a spirit of judgment, to distinguish matters of the highest value.
But on the other hand, when these [people] wise of heart come via their intellect to the place where, in truth, an exalted power that their understanding cannot parallel rests, they bring the power of faith forth from its concealment. And with that they stand on a level that is no less—from the aspect of the natural character of the human being—than [that of] all of the masses of the nation in whom natural faithfulness is guarded in its purity.

Paragraph 22

Faith in [physical] life is found among the common people more than it is found among those who are developed, people of understanding. But that faith is an illusory faith.
On the other hand, those who have clarity, who rise with their spiritual strength above the common plane, can by no means establish in their hearts faith in physical life.
Instead, they are filled with the light and strength of superior faith in true life.
However, in order to be well-grounded, they must overcome all of the obstacles of physical life with a strong spirit that is found among the wise who are free.
Then they shine like the brilliance of the firmament. Then, above all clouds of illusion, the charitable sun of knowledge and wisdom—which is coated within with a fine graciousness and serenity of the soul—shines for them.

Paragraph 23

Each of the different ways of understanding the knowledge of God has [its] place in the strata of life. The character of each person’s spirit differs from that of someone else. And in keeping with its aptitude, [that] spirit is drawn to a [particular] path of understanding.
No individual can completely understand someone else’s mind regarding the knowledge of God that is deep within him. As for external similarity that results from similar speech and ways of self-expression, and a similar way of life, that only touches the outer area of [this] knowledge. But in its inner being, in every human being [that knowledge] is always separate and upright, in its own form.

Paragraph 24

We must always proceed on the path between individuality and affinity, and develop [our] views in such a way that every person will be able to find his unique spirit in them, and at the same time be integrated into the realm of affinity, which [brings] everything into one entirety.

Paragraph 25

At the time of the breakdown of the nation—which is, together with that, a time of reconstitution and revival—we must engage in great spiritual work: the work of clarifying and refining [our] feelings and concepts, and in particular the work of clarifying [our] aesthetic sense, constraining the power of the imagination [in order] to strengthen it upon reliable foundations so that it will be useful and sweet, [and] burning it away where it breaks through its border and proceeds on an unpaved way.

Paragraph 26

The root of all of the different spiritual streams in the expanse of the human world is in the congregation of Israel, because she—in the spiritual sense unique to the yearnings of [her people’s] spirit, which rises to the heights of pure gladness—is the center of humanity.
Because of that, we absolutely cannot ignore any stream when we come to delineate the spiritual strength of the congregation of Israel, the “bride” (<i>kallah</i>) who “is composed (<i>kelulah</i>) of all colors.”

Paragraph 27

Rather, we must contemplate and study with a broad heart, with a clear mind and with a fearless spirit [that is primed] to develop in a person who knows his purpose, [who has] a clear awareness [blended] together with [his] philosophical study.
We must prepare ourselves with the best and highest ethical aspirations so that we will have a worthy personal basis on which to build [our] elevated aspirations, in which are rooted the established concepts of the people ([concepts that] are planted like powerful cedars [with] roots of faith and the branches of the Torah and the commandments).

Paragraph 28

The psychology of the individual—as well as the overall [psychology of] nation and mankind—provides an important prologue [to] the ways of explaining the paths of the Torah and serving [God].
In particular, we must enter into the depths of [this] wisdom of the soul in order to explain the content of the thoughts that affect us—[that come] as a result of [our] actions and [our] words—[and] via which we begin to understand the intent of the commandments and prayer, and the great value of our moral education and the rectification of the entire world.

Paragraph 29

Everything we say regarding elevated spiritual matters—in particular, matters of Divinity—is all connected more to the status of matters in our [own] personal state of being than it relates to the external world. But there is a certain [connection] regarding how the status of our personal state—its being, its reality, and the ways that it acts—relates to the [outer] world and all of existence.
And [that outer] existence is deep within us, perhaps [even] more than it is outside of us.
When we rise, all of existence rises, and when it rises, we too rise.
Mundane life encloses us in a narrow circle of limited senses until we ourselves cannot know our might and our greatness. And so, in order to recognize some few aspects of existence, a blind eye is needed regarding our [own] transcendence and greatness.
The “light that is seeded” [within us] blurs for us many worthy individual lines.
[It is true, therefore, that] we benefit from the light of those with darkened eyes who recognize the individual lines more than we do. Nevertheless, we will not be like them, and we will strive constantly to soar in the fullness of the light.

Paragraph 30

Although a mistake in [comprehending] Divine matters causes much damage, the essence of the damage that results from distorted concepts is not actualized to the point of killing a person’s soul—unless it coalesces into actions, or [unless] it at least descends into [forming] viewpoints and feelings that in the end will necessarily reveal themselves in actions.
But as long as the [mistake] remains in its intangible form, there is no essential uprooting.

Paragraph 31

In [saying] this, we are close to the view of the Ravad, who criticized the Rambam for calling a person who believes in the corporeality of Divinity a heretic.
And we can agree that, as long as this person who corporealizes [Divinity] does not make a statue or image [and thus] has not completed his thought, so that it still remains in the realm of spirit, this cannot be classed as uprooting and abandoning [our] religion.

Paragraph 32

Regarding the faiths that move away from the totality of the Torah, such as the Christian and Moslem faiths, the essence of [their] poison does not lie in their concept of Divinity, which differs from that which is correct according to the foundation of the light of the Torah, but in the fact that the result is the destruction of the practical commandments and the eradication of the hope of the nation [of Israel] for [its] complete revival.

Paragraph 33

Within the [core] of [a person’s] spirit, all of [his] best inclinations are hidden and concealed.
However, they must be brought out in actuality. And the best action [that does so] is [a person’s] speech, which affects [his] thought and imagination.
Therefore, prayer is preeminent, because it actualizes the highest feelings of the heart. And prayer is made in a form that parallels the feelings of the heart, whose way of perception is different than the way of logical perception.
When the spirit—of the individual and of the nation—is healthy, it is well-aware of its strength, and it is not at all afraid of logical contradictions, because it knows that the ways of expression of logic and of soulful feeling differ.
When that is the situation, prayer flowers. It rises of itself like a flame, without any foreign thoughts and any sadness of the spirit.
But when the nation is impoverished, the power of national feeling is diminished. And in its place, only logic remains, which, [despite] all of its deficiency, [must now] support [the person’s] feeling.
But [that is not enough]. Since the soulful feeling is such in a state of weakness that it must be supported at the table of another and it does not gain sustenance from within itself, contradictions appear, and a battle rises at every time of prayer [as a person’s] thoughts grow ever more chaotic, and [his] prayer loses its great value of reviving [his] soul at [its] core. Then the [person’s] intent weakens, and [all that] remains is “rote human behavior.”
And since [his prayer] does not nourish [his] feeling well, just as [his prayer] is not nourished well by [his feeling], [his prayer] wanders to the tents of intellect and calculation.
And when intellect, with its cold hands, deals with warm prayer, which is the recipient of the heavenly fire, it destroys [prayer’s] might and diminishes as well its [own] clear and cold light, and they both grow deficient.

Paragraph 34

A person can only truly cling to the national foundation of Israel when his soul has been purified through teshuvah from disgraceful human sins and base traits, or if his spirit from the start has been a pure spirit.
That is because the true foundation of the character of the Israelite nation is the aspiration for supernal righteousness: the righteousness of Hashem in the world. And if a person has been polluted by some sin, corresponding to the measure of his pollution, the desire for righteousness and goodness does not shine properly in him. Therefore, he is not truly connected with the national character until he purifies himself.

Paragraph 35

When we rise above the limitations of ordinary reasoning, the value of goodness expands until it arouses a yearning that is a great flame in the entire stature of [our] soul.
When a person recognizes the spiritual oneness of reality with an inner, supernal recognition, that [oneness] draws his spirit to goodness, to good deeds and lovely feelings that are pleasant with the intrinsic pleasantness of [the spiritual] worlds.
Faith expands within this person’s “kidneys and heart.” And the sense of how all of the good that an individual increases when he engages in good deeds and in good thoughts and words, [of how this individual] sweetens all of existence, encourages him and sweeps him up to the heavens.
[This] person knows, as an abundance of holy inspiration flows onto his soul, that whenever he elevates himself—by means of good deeds [or] by means of a supernal inspiration of a yearning for Divinity, wisdom, justice, beauty, and uprightness—he improves the spiritual character of all existence.
All people become improved in the hiddenness of their heart as a result of the supernal improvement of one of them.
The grief of a number of people sad in spirit is softened and diluted by the droplets of [that] softening because of the strong arousal of a Godly consolation in one soul.
Even predatory animals and all harmful creatures grow softer. Their venom is lessened somewhat as a result of the general propensity of this soul that takes delight in Hashem.
And the best among human beings grow in their goodness, and their joy in goodness and in uprightness grows. And all of the supernal worlds, the supernal angels, are aroused with a sweet, holy melody, and they rise with a beautiful, gracious song, and the might of the supernal host grows more splendid.
And all thoughts that expand the power of the spirit have [their] place only in a soul that is free—with an absolute freedom—from the shackles of ordinary reasoning, which binds ideas and kills song.

Paragraph 36

Every living being on the face of the earth and in the entire fullness of Creation, wherever living beings exist, is subject to the law of the propensity for [self-]preservation.
This law must exist in nature. But it grows weak when an analyzing mind develops, [a mind] that assesses the value of existence not with natural appraisal but with rational evaluation.
So, as soon as mind awakens even slightly, even if it cannot yet evaluate and [cannot] strongly indicate the path of life, [that] natural propensity immediately weakens.
This law [of self-preservation] is for the good and for betterment, [because it] compels the mind to hold firm. The mind too will be helped by the natural propensity of the desire for [self-]preservation, which is not completely foreign to it.
We see this regarding the existence of faith: in the world, and especially among [the people of] Israel.
Religion was safeguarded for the entire [Jewish] nation, and faith was well-preserved among humanity. The cause was the power of [this] natural propensity. Societal life and a firm nationality could exist only as a result of the power of the existence of faith.
But as life improved and mind and moral awareness developed, this natural propensity weakened. And now religion and faith no longer exist in keeping with that natural propensity, but in keeping with an evaluation that results from the awareness of the goodness and truth [of religion and faith].
This awareness has not yet matured, because spiritual development has not yet reached that level. But the beginning of the illumination has succeeded in weakening [this] natural propensity.
And since ultimately there can only be a permanent and full steadiness with the light of faith, which is more elevated than every type of human darkness, awareness must rise until it reaches its goal.
“And the faith of your time will be a refuge, salvation [that comes as a result] of wisdom and knowledge” (Isaiah 33:6).

Paragraph 37

The elevation of the soul must drive away lowly traits.
The delight of the light of knowing raises a person from the depths [his] enslavement to delusion, [something] to which he is always connected.
Clear knowledge can be established only when the dregs of a fearful heart, of flattery and self-deception, are removed from a person’s inner character.

Paragraph 38

Judaism in exile essentially has no basis in practicality. It is only a vision in the heart, based on images of hope and of precious ideas about the future and about the past.
But there is a limit on how much strength the vision of the heart possesses to bear the burden of life, and forge—with that strength—a path for the nation’s life.
And the limit, it seems, has already been reached.
As a result, Judaism descends, plunges into exile.
Its only hope is to be planted in the source of life [that is within] actual life.
Even one spark of actual life will enliven a great and broad quantity of visionary life.
The actual life of Judaism is revealed only with the return of the nation to its land.
That is the paved road to the return to life.
Everything elevated in [the nations’] spirit and in the vision of its heart will rise and live, in keeping with the measure to which the foundation of action will participate in reviving the languishing vision.

Paragraph 39

The more the world improves and the spirit of man develops inside him, the more the demand to live in keeping with the natural spirit inside him is awakened, with a stronger voice.
That demand has a great deal of truth and justice. People with a perfected awareness must refine it and establish it in its place.
A person goes and finds God inside himself.
In his correct inclinations, and even those that appear at first to be straying from the good way accepted by the normative outlook, he can rise so high that he will know how to establish everything for a structure of might and happiness.

Paragraph 40

When the Congregation of Israel is aroused to [its] revival, she finds her might and honor within herself. All of the purity and holiness that are usually found in subjugation and compliance [now] shine with the soulful might of the appearance of the nation’s power.
[Then,] with a pure awareness, we bind souls, the new and the old together.

Paragraph 41

Protecting historical, [traditional] Judaism, Judaism [as it expresses itself] in deeds, is one of the greatest obligations of every caring person who has any ability to act in accordance with his spirit.
The abandonment of [traditional Jewish] actions because of a weak spirit, refraining from participating in the ways of life of the entirety of the nation throughout its generations—in [regard to] keeping the Sabbaths and holidays and their holiness, in regard to forbidden foods and their details, in regard to meeting in the synagogues and study halls—gradually diminishes the character of the nation and impoverishes the strength of [its] cohesion.
If it is only possible for these actions to be maintained as a result of explanation and rationale regarding the concepts that preserve them, [then] promulgating the acquisition of those concepts is obligatory, equal to promulgating the acquisition of the actions [themselves].

Paragraph 42

The Torah is integrated with the spirit of Israel.
The unalloyed spirit of Israel contains everything: the light of God, the purpose of existence, the source of souls.
When the Torah grows strong, when its knowledge spreads, when its light radiates, when its feelings grow deep within every soul, [then] Divine light spreads more throughout the world, grows magnificent and is elevated. And the entire world rises as those few people who have an exalted spirit rise.

Paragraph 43

The unsullied thinkers reach their greatness with the breadth of their thought. But they too must raise their feelings.
And when they sink into the depths of the darkness, they must call out strongly, waking up, [telling] themselves to emerge from the gloom to the light. Then their hearts will cry out to Hashem.

Paragraph 44

Strength, physical vigor, must exist in righteous people with upright hearts so that the phenomenon of the impulse for good will compel its influence on the world.
The weakening of the strength of the righteous, who need to be girded with might, weakens the light of the world.

Paragraph 45

Sometimes we fulfill a spiritual lack not by [engaging in] any [Divine] service or any teshuvah but by increasing the strength of the body.

Paragraph 46

When a person goes on the path of the pure contemplation of Divinity, he senses within himself a barrier that separates him from clear realizations. And [his] soul itself recognizes that this barrier [consists of his] actions and traits that are not good.
Immediately, then, a yearning awakens in [his] heart for complete teshuvah. [And] that [yearning] is [itself] the finest teshuvah.
Many times, it doesn’t become properly active until it is attached to fresh prayer.
Then the wellspring of might once again pours out onto [this person’s] soul.

Paragraph 47

Thought in matters of Divinity positively affects all of a person’s traits when it is pure—that is to say, when it is mature, with an inner yearning to recognize the truth and with a desire for justice and honesty, without any gross ulterior motives.
And it not only positively affects the particular traits of [this] individual but it refines and purifies all being because a component of [being], this individual who is sincerely seeking God, is constantly rising.

Paragraph 48

The more that the search for Hashem gains strength in a person’s heart, the more [his] love for all creatures expands within him. He loves even the wicked and the heretics, and he desires their repair, and indeed he truly repairs them with his great faith.
However, on a revealed [level], a person only has the strength to exhibit love to those in whom he can find something good, because then he can attach his love to the aspect of good, and the evil, ugly side of those people—whom he loves from the aspect of his good trait of loving people, which includes being good and doing good for both the evil and the good—will not harm him at all.

Paragraph 49

In prayer and in mitzvot, we build the faculty of imagination so that it [becomes] pure and strong, and fit to be the basis of [our] accomplishing intelligence.

Paragraph 50

The image of Divinity that a person visualizes in his mind is always alloyed with the dross of disappointing illusions. Consequently, [that image] undermines the life of the individual and of society. All evil counsel regarding the ways of life and all evil traits result from that.
A person is rescued from that disease only when he accustoms his mind to involve itself with the paths of a good life and the ways of wisdom and morality. [Then his] concept of God will be the foundation of all of his aspirations, but without any specific form.
Then he will always be filled with clear thoughts, and his spiritual capacity will be constantly strengthened, rising from level to level.

Paragraph 51

When a yearning for justice and a moral disposition greatly increase in a person’s heart, it sometimes becomes a sort of disease that destroys extensive goodness as it drills constantly into the core of [his feelings], finding blemishes in [his] moral behavior and threatening him excessively—until it stands as a barrier that detaches him from the light of Hashem shining in the joy of the spirit.

Paragraph 52

A person’s sins and unpurified character traits dull his heart until, while his spirit is darkened by them, his objective sight absolutely cannot broaden and expand.
A contemplative person who wants to rise to the heights of awareness will sense this intuitively, and he will sense the absolute necessity to do complete teshuvah so that his awareness will not be impaired.
Regarding all of his transgressions between himself and God, when he does spiritual teshuvah, that will immediately restore the gladness of emancipation that the light of [his] spirit [possesses].
But regarding sins between himself and others, [a person’s] spirit cannot be whole until it is rectified [as a result of his engaging] in [proper] activity. However, sometimes a person encounters stumbling blocks and barriers that he cannot overcome. As long as [his sins] are not rectified, they withhold the light of knowledge and prevent him from recognizing God’s universal justice, and [they prevent] him from yearning for [this justice] to emerge from its concealment.
Nevertheless, when he makes a strong resolution to be careful at least from now on not to sin against people and to strive to rectify the past, then, corresponding to the extent that he brings about teshuvah in action, spiritual light will shine onto his soul until the striving of his spirit will itself increase the pathways [leading him] to complete his practical teshuvah, so that the spiritual light will be able to rest on his soul that thirsts for [that light]—[resting on him] in all of its fullness and in all of its goodness.

Paragraph 53

[A person’s] yearning for spiritual clarity and for an expanse of supernal images itself arouses [his] preparation for the infusion of Divine inspiration.

Paragraph 54

When a person empowers [his] mind over his spirit, and the way that he conducts himself is not in accord with the way that simple nature would determine but in accordance with [his] mindful judgment, he embosses a portion of all existence with that stamp, so that its most shining aspect reveals its light and governance. And so the world improves to the degree that this person is involved in it.
And if he rises so high that—because of his spirit’s vast yearning for mindfulness and uprightness—his natural decision-making functions in accordance with his mindfulness, then in the essence of existence the hidden light shines, until many [of its] components that are in themselves ugly and lowly are transformed [and] become radiant and uplifted.

Paragraph 55

The concept that all existence is solely a matter of Divinity and that there is absolutely nothing but Hashem delights the heart exceedingly.
And the spiritual delight that this concept brings about is truly a proof that expresses that truth.

Paragraph 56

[A person’s] sin causes him to fear his thinking, and so he doesn’t delve into exalted concepts at length.
But the more a person removes himself from sin, the more his fear of thinking will diminish, and he will be enabled to rise [to] infinite vistas and matters that stand at the apex of the world with his visualizations.

Paragraph 57

Complacency—a person’s contentment with his concepts of Divinity [marked by] deceitful delusions, which are embedded in his heart since [his childhood,] the days when he lacked awareness—is due to [his] ardor for animalistic pleasures.

Paragraph 58

It is impossible to surmise the beauty and delight of deep immersion in Divine knowledge that results from full knowledge [and that is] clothed in the gratifying feeling and radiant garment of rarified imagination.
All seers of visions and all singers of the love of [spiritual] delights would grow weary describing even a small portion of the satiety of the soul and its Edenic rivers in its exalted state, when it stands entirely in its Divine world.
And in addition to this endless elevated delight, this spiritual form that the soul wears as a result of [being in] this elevated state, [the soul] is filled with a royal splendor and the entire grandeur of good traits, until it is scented with the fragrances of Eden of the most lucid and enlightened ethics, in a whole and radiant form that has no equal in the entire imprint of ethics in [this] world that can come through any learning or any other perception.
The rarefication of the soul in its supernal, Edenic state penetrates so much into [the soul’s] might and roots of its being that [the soul] with its might then rarifies everything that surrounds it and touches it, that surrounds and touches [the soul’s] essence and reality.
And when the soul shines and is made Edenic by Hashem, and the delight of recognizing Divinity and its joy exists on earth, [then] every [human] soul, every animal soul, every bush and plant, and the entire power of life concealed in every element and inanimate object draws Edenic being and elevation.
This clear outlook, which is ultimately attained by means of Divine inspiration, which is prepared to appear in [the nation of] Israel and through it in the entire world, is at present as well the chief source of all delights.

Paragraph 59

There is a particular form in which imagination clothes itself when the mind exerts an effect on it.
That form is holiness. [That form] gives fragrance to the world, and it purifies a person of his every uncleanness.
But when that form blurs and the imagination is [instead] given form according to its own character, without mind’s influence upon it, then [the imagination] is the most tawdry source of every blunder, every transgression and sin—in the life of the individual and in the life of the community.
The [holy] form of the imagination maintains its essential purity in accordance with how those people who inherently possess the power to live a life of the spirit in the light of the mind are directly influenced by [their] mind.
But it improves and is built as well in an honorable form when [the proper] ways of life and form of feelings that great people attain as a result of the aspect of the influence of [their] mind exercise an effect on average and small people, in keeping with the general influence of great people upon the small.
[These] deeds and images will direct the power of life, [a power] that attaches itself to imaginative forms, to the desired goal.

Paragraph 60

Indeed, [a person’s] full mind, which is capable of placing the steps of [his] imagination on the path of life, is the Godly mind, from which comes the manifestation of prophecy with the revelation of the Torah, the light of Divine inspiration, the drawing of the ways of wisdom onto all people who seek Hashem, all of the characteristics [in a person] that result from the influence [of those ways of wisdom], and a form of life by means of which [life] elevates the imagination from its lowliness and makes it shine with the light of the mind, granting each person happiness.

Paragraph 61

There are [some] people whom God has made upright, whose character is calm, and whose unwavering way of life [follows] straightforward guidance and [is marked by] inner serenity.
Yes, if they toil in Torah, in [learning] ethics and wisdom, they will rise to great levels. But at any rate, they are upright people, good and honest.
These people must engage in practical employments or practical professions.
Their moral aspect stands on its own, in its place, with its serenity.
Possibly, it will not rise to an exalted height, but neither will it descend to a low level.
But there is another type: [people] who are not at ease, who are always on the edge, either rising to the heights of heaven or descending to the depths of the abyss.
They must rectify their spiritual being every day.
Those who find the way they need will rise higher and higher. But if they abandon it, they are liable to descend lower and lower.
These people must constantly engage in Torah and service [of God], [learn] ethical [teachings] and [develop] holy feelings. Heaven forbid that they turn aside to the way of this world and practical professions.
In the course of the generations in general, the general character of some generations is of the first type, of those with a tranquil disposition [and] a steady character. Their education should be like that of these individuals with a steady character.
And there are also generations of a changeable character, whose spiritual sustenance must be constant, with an ongoing flow.
Sometimes we find that in some particular area a person or a generation has an aspect of tranquility, and in another area an aspect of changeability.
We require leaders who are concerned for the good of the whole, who will focus their minds on how to educate each part of the generation by itself.

Paragraph 62

All [of a person’s] thoughts that are spoken and expressed in accordance with an imagination that leads to an improvement of ethics and to feelings of holiness exist always, even as the light of radiant intelligence shines on them—but [then] they are renewed in a new form.

Paragraph 63

The congregation of Israel at present is at a turning point of emerging from a life of instinct to a life of awareness.
Natural instinct is more confident [than conscious awareness] in its course, and more [precisely] directed in its activity to maintain life.
But a human being’s perfected character will not allow him to remain forever enclosed in his natural state. Even against his will, he will rise from his enclosure and emerge to a level of awareness. There, he will lose much of his natural qualities. But in the end, he will adapt them more beautifully.
[This is like] all living beings and humanity: as long as they remain in their natural state, nature affects them in order to give them the wisdom to protect [their] lives and continue [their] existence.
[Then,] the more they begin to acquire cultivation and awareness, [the more] must they engage in all of [their same activities] with a clear, inner awareness, and not out of a strong and blind, inner compulsion.
[That compulsion has comprised] the state of [our] nation in [its] exile in regard to Judaism, to valuing faith, and to keeping the Torah.
[When our nation is] in a state of slumber, the instinct for national self-preservation directs each individual to keep [our] religion and to honor faith overall out of an inner, natural awareness that with [people’s] separation from each element in the life of religion, the feelings of the nation would cease to exist, and [the nation itself] would burst apart and cease to exist.
This entire state [of instinctive behavior] was strong before the light of the national renaissance began to shine due to [the people’s] desire and awareness and on a practical basis, out of being strongly attracted to gather in the land of Israel and establish anew the national life that [had existed] in earlier days. [Earlier], the times were not suitable for that, neither from our standpoint nor from the standpoint of the world.
[At that time,] clear awareness [regarding] the desire for the [on-going] existence of the nation and the pathways of its renaissance could not be attained.
If some weakness would have affected the natural influence [upon us], the danger would have been very terrible.
[But] now the turn of clear awareness has come. When this will be completed, great things will begin—much more than all of the activities of natural, blind awareness—[moving] towards the existence of the Divine light, towards the knowledge of Hashem that is unique to Israel, towards faith and towards keeping the Torah, which [constitutes] the entirety of the paths of life for Israel.
But at present, after the spark of a small beginning, [this] matter has caused the cessation and weakness of the instinct regarding religion and faith, [even as] the awareness has not completed its function.
Therefore, we are desolated at the sight of the destruction.
But we must not be desolated and in despair, nor sit with folded hands, doing nothing.
Rather, we must know how to grasp the roots of the renewal of the spirit and make its branches give forth fruit.
If we cannot immediately restore all of the losses, we must [at least] strive to restore what we can.
When breaches come about due to a spirit of coarseness, animal nature and dullness of the heart, then if we depend on being healed by the renewal of the spirit and enhanced knowledge, without turning to rectify [our] actions, that can lead to a malfunction, to thinking that the spirit and the idea are sufficient in themselves. [Then] we will not absorb them well, and the turmoil will increase.
This is not the case when the inner cause of all of the failures is an inner illumination towards a clear recognition, which, with its being revealed, weakened the power of instinct.
Truthfully, if we leave the situation this way, matters will go from bad to worse.
But when we begin to illuminate the spirit and to perfect [our] inner awareness more and more, to hasten to reveal it, then it will itself begin to restore all that was lost to us as a result of the fall of the instinct, in a clearer way, and [our] spiritual life will again receive a form that gives light, and the heart of the sons will begin to return to the fathers, and life will begin to be more filled with the dew of the renewal of holiness and the awareness, honor, and appreciation of faith.
And the desire to keep the commandments, to perfect Israelite life, will return to us with all of the beauty of its splendor and glory, and it will reveal its activity for the good in a place where the horn of the house of Israel flowers, in the beloved land, in the places of its renaissance—in particular, in the cities of Yehudah, which are slowly being perfected.

Paragraph 64

A person’s desolation of thought [that results] from his minimal amount of learning and knowledge causes him to think extensively about the nature of Godliness. [But] he cannot imagine how much this thought is a terrible insolence and an appalling folly.
The more a person is steeped in boorishness, [the more] he thinks that with this [contemplation] he approaches elevated Divine knowledge, something that, he has always heard, all great spirits in the world yearn for.
Over a number of generations, the habit of pondering this errant thought—as though it is possible to consider the Divine character—has accumulated, [until] many futile breaths have woven together, whose outcome is many terrible evils, [leading to] so much trouble and darkness that even the individual loses his material and spiritual strength.
That which comes to purify the air of the pollution of this insolence and wickedness is absolute heresy. That itself is no better than the former, but it opposes [the former] with an absolute antagonism.
The confrontation between these two opposites helps humanity tremendously in coming to know Hashem [with] a shining knowledge, a knowledge that brings a person close to his happiness, [both] temporal and eternal.
[Then,] instead of a person’s desolate thought that he will burst through [in an attempt to understand] the Divine being, a clear thought enters his heart about pure ethics and supernal might, which sketches his pathways of life. And [with that thought,] he stands in the light of Hashem.

Paragraph 65

[There are] two aspects of thought regarding Godliness.
The first aspect [is thought] in a form that speaks about the Creator and creation, each in and of itself. It is as though each is a separate topic, but joined together, because the Creator gives life to creation and creation receives life from the Creator.
The second aspect is that creation does not exist at all, and that the name “creation” is only a borrowed [term, alluding to something that appears to exist] from our [perspective]. We [ourselves] are creatures only [in terms of] the constricted nature of our comprehension, whereas in truth everything is the Creator, God. But everything is a different matter and a different content [than our perspective,] because there is no such thing as a partial revelation [of Godliness], and God is the all, and not [enclosed in] any part as a [separate] part. Each facet of this [second way of] thought has its specific effect on a person’s spirit.
Logic and calculation come from the aspect of thought [that] evaluates the world and the Creation as two [separate] entities. On the other hand, song and an uplifted spirit come from the second view: that of discovering the nothingness of the all besides God, and God’s glory filling all.
Ethics is a branch composed of logic and song when they are blended properly together. When [this branch] lacks one power [of the two], it cannot endure.
Regarding the first [type of] thought—involving a division between thought about God and [thought] about the world—with its guidance, the form [as we appreciate it] of the righteousness of God, of the greatness of the morality that appears to us in keeping with [our] thought [about] God, is revealed. And this morality grows complete in its rules with logic and reckoning. When, afterwards, the second thought about Godliness comes—[once God’s] righteousness and splendid ethics filled with one’s awareness [of Him] has already been well-established in the soul—song gains strength as a result of the supernal, passionate discerning that “There is no other than He.” And [that song] contributes the fruit of blessing to the ethics.
But if, at the beginning, thought would be marked only by its single aspect of “There is no other than He,” there would be no place for any vision of ethics that has a relationship with Godliness to act upon us. [That is because] we cannot recognize a moral value regarding one entity in relation to itself, but [only] in a relationship of one to others.
Although elevation of [the second type of] thought is [intrinsically] higher than every vision of the entire stratum of ethics, just as it is higher than all thoughts and boundaries, a person cannot grasp a thought higher than his [own] finite level in all of its glory. And [so] the values of ethics must always be aroused and brought forth repeatedly [in a person] throughout all of the ways of [his] life. [That means] that [when they are not aroused] there is a terrible danger that an intensification of the second [type of] thought can overcome the first [and eliminate the connection to ethics]. But [on the other hand] if there is an intensification of the first [type of] thought, [a type of thought] whose wings are clipped, [then too] a person’s spirit can sink, and as a result of [that] sinking, he can lose many precious things.
Therefore, there is no other medicine but to arrange [one’s] idea in such a way that the first thought will always clothe the second, and it should never be revealed that the first is in the role of a garment to the second, which is higher than itself. <i>Zeir Anpin</i> clothes <i>Erech Anpin</i>, and “Hashem—He is God!”

Paragraph 66

Every day, [a person] must purify and elevate [his] power of imagination.
To that end, we must pray.
One cannot imagine the pollution that proliferates in the spirit of the individual, in the spirit of the entire nation, in the spirit of humanity, in the living, overall spirit of [animals] living with us [on earth], and in the overall spirit of existence, that results from a lapse in the constant purification of the power of the imagination.
Unless we strive to raise it ceaselessly, this power is liable to contract impurity and descend to the ultimate baseness.
This has nothing to do with the intellect. The intellect stands in its intrinsic purity. It need only be connected with us. We must be illuminated by its light by means of [our] constant engagement in employing [our] intellect with concepts of truth in Torah and wisdom.
But imaginative power requires purity and elevation. And [so], at every period of time, it needs encouragement and illumination.
To that end, we must [recite] blessings, give thanks, and recite prayers at set times. Happy is the person who is careful in [engaging in] these [matters] with good intention. He illuminates himself and the entire world.

Paragraph 67

Just as the pollution of the soul can coalesce in an individual’s spirit to dislodge it from its good character and transform it to something base, to drag it down to a mean stratum of life, so [too] can it coalesce within the overall spirit of an entire nation to turn it into a base and evil nation, despised and abhorrent, one that deserves to pass away from the world so that it will not interfere with the spreading of the universal beauty of the loveliness of the world.

Paragraph 68

When Godly purity shines suitably, it cleanses everything.
[Then,] as a result of the Divine light that shines the rays of its light upon it powerfully and fully, the individual’s soul grows radiant, holy, and mighty.
[But] it is polluted and darkened to the degree that the Divine light is far from it or obscured in it.
The same applies to the soul of the entire nation. When a living stream of the appearance of God flows in [the nation], it is healthy, strong, and pure.
[But] when God’s Presence leaves its midst, it immediately degenerates, and its pollution in it is revealed.
The national spirit can become impure as [can] the spirit of an individual. It can have base and evil yearnings that, in keeping with the quantity of its power and greatness, will grow to a much more considerable evil than the evil yearnings of evil individuals.
Therefore, purity requires the spirit: purity requires the spirit of purity in the source of the purity of the Divine wellspring.

Paragraph 69

When the nation’s deeds are good, when its traits are clean, it dreams of supernal holiness, and its intellect shines with the light of God.
[But] when [its] deeds are diminished and [its] traits are sullied, [its] national yearnings too are lowly and ugly, and weak as well, because there is no true strength but the strength of [heaven] above, the might of God.

Paragraph 70

[God has made] a firm commitment to the entire Congregation of Israel that it will never grow completely polluted. It may be affected by pollution, which can cause it to become blemished, but [the pollution] cannot entirely disconnect it from the Source of Divine life.

Paragraph 71

[Our] national spirit has now awoken, [and] many of those who cleave to [that spirit] say that they do not need the spirit of God.
If they would truly be able to establish that type of a national spirit among [the people of] Israel, they would be able to establish [our] nation on the basis of pollution and annihilation.
But they themselves do not know what they want. So strongly is the spirit of Israel bound to the spirit of God that even if a person says that he has no need at all for the spirit of Hashem, [the fact that] he says that he desires the spirit of Israel [shows that] a Divine spirit rests within him. [It is] the core of his yearning—even against his will.
The individual can disconnect himself from the Source of life, [but] the nation, the Congregation of Israel in [its] entirety, cannot.
Therefore, a spirit of God rests in all of the possessions of the nation, which it loves from the aspect of its national spirit: its land, its language, its history, its customs.
[But] if, at any time, a spirit should be aroused that [would lead] all of these [people] to speak in the name of the spirit of the nation only and attempt to remove the spirit of God from all of these possessions and from their revealed source, which is the [holy] spirit of the nation, what must the righteous people of the generation do then?
To rebel against the spirit of the nation, even in speech, and to renounce its possessions is impossible: the spirit of Hashem and the spirit of Israel is one. But they must work [with] great labor to reveal the light and holiness in the spirit of the nation, the light of God within all of these [people], until those people who maintain these thoughts [regarding] the spirit [of the nation of Israel] and all of its possessions will find that they are immersed, rooted, and living in the life of God, illuminated by holiness and the might of [heaven] above.

Paragraph 72

Prayer [both] fortifies [a person’s] will and weakens [his] will. That is to say, it fortifies [his] good, ethical, holy will, and it weakens [his] barbaric, evil will.
To [reach] the [latter] goal—[that] of weakening the will—a person need not greatly elevate [his] personal character. His recognition that his ethics are corrupt, his awareness of [this] in himself, causes him an inner anguish, and his spirit sinks within him. When he casts himself down in his prayer, [his] evil will is weakened. [Then] even afterwards, in the marketplace of life, he acts for the good.
That is not the case with fortifying the will. The recognition of goodness and the drive to reinforce it requires the illumination of a great spirit.
Sometimes, as a result of constantly lamenting over his spirit and suspecting himself of having abandoned [his] ethics, a person views every tendency of a strong [will within himself] as evil and baleful.
Regarding this, a person needs a clear reckoning and the illumination of [his] might, so that he will know his good side, whose goal is that he will be elevated by [his] prayer and [that he will] increase [his] might.

Paragraph 73

The essential [cause] of the distancing of [people’s] heart from prayer, [a problem] that is characteristic of this generation, is that the core of life of the Congregation of Israel has increased in strength, and its desire for the general good has been fortified. [Since] prayer, [which] is always associated with ancient [ideals], has been overwhelmed by the negative aspect of the weakening of the will, the generation does not find the might and beauty [that exists] within [prayer].
We must reveal the aspect of light [that exists in prayer], that aspect in which good desire is hidden, and [with that] we must bind prayer to the idea of the intensification of the will.
Then many [people] will stream to prayer, and there will come [about] as well the goal of the weakening of the sullied will.

Paragraph 74

When the full light of the intellect shines, there is no need for especial guidance of rules and laws.
[Then] the absolute good in action is drawn after the intellectual light, and all of the obstacles of life straighten themselves out.
Rules and laws [then] exist not as commanded rules and laws but as natural movements, as matters upon which the light of the intellect [shines] powerfully.
Good and evil, all of their strata and divisions, and the great toil in navigating a middle path without adding or detracting—all of these came about after the intellect diminished its light, and its place was taken by feeling, impressionability and immersion [in] the senses, which followed the primal sin of eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.

Paragraph 75

A person may not allow [one’s] fear of heaven to override his natural morality. Were his fear of heaven [to do so], it would no longer be pure. The mark of a pure fear of heaven is that it elevates a person’s natural morality – which is planted in one’s straightforward nature – to higher levels than that which it [could] otherwise stand upon. But if we imagine a fear of heaven of such a nature that without its influence on [a person’s] life, [one’s] life would tend to result in more good and bring about [more] matters that help the individual and the community, and the influence [of that fear of heaven] would diminish this active power – such a fear of heaven is a flawed fear.

The sign of a pure fear of heaven is that a person’s natural [sense of] ethics, planted in his upright nature, rises in accordance with [his fear of heaven] to higher levels than it would reach without [the fear of heaven].
But if there may be imagined a fear of heaven of such a type that, without its influence on a person’s life, his life would tend to bring about more goodness and bring about matters useful for the individual and the whole, [whereas] in accordance with its influence the power of such activity would diminish, such a fear of heaven is an invalid fear.

Paragraph 76

We must imagine all hidden matters in relationship to how they are apprehended by our intellect, as well as [how they are apprehended] by our power of imagination when it is illuminated by the light of [our] intellect.
[When we do] that, we enter the outer gate of all of the beloved [types of] knowledge regarding matters that lie beyond the senses.
Once the view is established within us that all things exist in a true spiritual existence that has a relationship to our intellectual images, we can broaden the boundary of our knowledge to the expansive existence of spirituality beyond our being.
But if we will not proceed step by step from the inner image within us to the outer world, we will not find anything at all of what we desire [to attain] from spiritual attainments.

Paragraph 77

Purity of the soul causes us to feel all [of our] sins acutely: those whose way to repair is cleared before us, as well as those whose repair is blocked before us.
Therefore, a person should not be at all alarmed when he senses the entire burden of [his] sins, and they should not cause him any negligence in [attaining] perfection in the light and joy of the Torah, and [in gaining] freedom of thought in the movement of [his] mind, because a person’s alarm when he apprehends the multitude of his sins is itself a sign that his soul is purified. And certainly paths will be opened before him [so that he may] transform to complete merits even those sins that he presently cannot find any way [to repair]—in particular, matters between man and man that involve money, and matters of causing people to err, which are difficult to repair.
When a person feels an inner desire to repair everything, everything comes about to help give merit to him and to the entire world. Therefore, he must always be happy on whatever level he finds himself, since the inner nature of his predisposition [and temperament] is for the good.

Paragraph 78

How do we raise holy sparks from the depths of the [evil] “husks”?
We purify [our] heart by means of the guidance of enlightened and pure ethics. We sanctify [our heart] by means of elevated ideas about clinging to Hashem and knowing Hashem to the worthy [extent] that a person can reach in accordance with his intellect and the power of his soul.
Afterwards, we peregrinate through the entire fullness of the idea[s] that encompasses all of the chambers of [our] spirit, and among all of the ideas and concepts that are floating about in the world. And in all of them we distinguish what they have for the good and what [they have] for the bad.
Also, regarding ideas that a number of wicked people have used for evil, we meticulously discern the nucleus of good they possess. And when we find the good kernel within the depths of the evil, we hold it, polish it, and expand it, and we extract what we can [and bring it] into actuality.
And with that, the spark rises to its holy place.

Paragraph 79

Just as the knowledge of Hashem transcends every field of knowledge, so [too] it lowers itself to bring light within the smallest of hearts, and it progressively illuminates all distinguished people, each on his level.
The [very] possibility of [possessing] knowledge of Hashem cleanses the entire world, even though this potential has not yet been realized.

Paragraph 80

Those unique human beings who find within themselves a disposition to know Hashem must immerse themselves in this more than in any of the fields of the Torah and worldly wisdom. They do not have permission to turn away from this level that they are on due to any hindrance in the world—even if it seems to them that as a result of immersing themselves in the knowledge of Hashem they will forego a number of matters involving [performing] practical mitzvot and knowing the Torah, or that they will not fulfill their obligation in regarding their material well-being.
[That is] because all practical and Torah perfection only [functions] to guide a person [and] bring him to the supernal state of pursuing the knowledge of Hashem. And since he has already reached this supernal trait, Heaven forbid that [he should] abandon a powerful holiness and engage in a slight holiness.
And it is certain that via the supernal illumination of his soul that is truly immersed in the light of Hashem, all of the paths of knowledge will be expanded for him, and his heart will be filled with the light of justice and [bringing] civilization to the world until he will find vast blessing and breadth of heart, [making it possible for him] to engage with true holiness both in the practical aspect of the Torah and regarding his material well-being, [which he will do] with prodigious success—much more than those who are immersed in practical matters alone, who have not reached the measure of true thirst for the knowledge of Hashem.

Paragraph 81

[A person’s] knowledge of Hashem will necessarily must full [with his] powerful thinking about Torah and of wisdom, [of] all of the wisdom of the world and the wisdom of life, [of] all natural integrity in ethics and in culture, and [of] all preparation of strength of the body and vigor of the spirit.
Then, to the extent that a person’s spirit—which yearns for the light of the knowledge of Hashem—is capable, [his knowledge of Hashem] becomes actual.

Paragraph 82

It is not only a person’s intellectual enlightenment with clear understanding of Godly matters that elevates his soul. So do the visualizations of [his] imagination. However, [his] imagination must be illuminated by [his] mind as much as possible, so that [his] imaginative faculty will not extend beyond its proper boundary—in particular, so that it will not break through to act in [this] world of action in accordance [only] with [its] inner, envisaging character.
In addition, [a person’s] ethical purity must be truly strong and purified, and [his] good traits [must be] firmly established in [his] spirit. Then even [his] imaginative power, when it is truly devoted to Godly matters, will perform great wonders and salvations in [his] soul and [in the soul] of the entire [people]. It will be the fundamental factor in the renewal of the world regarding even the refined and integrated spirit of practical knowledge and positive societal intelligence.

Paragraph 83

When we completely remove [our] thought from all physical matters, even from the good within [those matters]—i.e., desirable societal activities—[our] Godly yearning intensifies. Therefore, a person’s spiritual soul intensifies and, because of its closeness to the Divine source, all of its abilities are straightened out.
When the soul’s awareness is detached from tangible matters, it is in such a state of being that [renders] it unfit [to engage in] any action involving matters of societal life. Nevertheless, [being in] this state helps [the soul] a great deal, because afterwards, when it descends from its elevation and comes to engage in the practical structures and tangible areas of life, they are all made straight out before it, because at that time [the soul] finds itself filled with might and uprightness to an extent that is not found in simple human uprightness and might, which is always adulterated by aberrations and weaknesses.

Paragraph 84

[A person’s] soul has the power to attain true insights from deep within itself, from the very source of its spring.
These insights are high and pure to the extent of the purity of the soul in its deeds and in its wisdom gained by learning.
[But] more than all [such] purity, there shines before [the soul] the path of ethical purity [that comes from a person’s] good character traits], [as well as the person’s] possession of understanding in [the area of] faith [that is] in keeping with the feeling of [his] pure heart, [a heart] that is not artful with contorted ways.

Paragraph 85

Certainly, no information and intelligence on our level has any connection to the Infinite One. Nevertheless, [although, when we consider something beyond our ability to conceptualize, we can only conceptualize nothingness] we must extricate ourselves from the image of a superficial nothingness to which a lack of intellect leads.
And we do that by constantly involving ourselves in study of the Divine, to the extent that [our] spirit can bear.
Although [our spirit] gains nothing of a positive conceptualization regarding the truth of Hashem in terms of [His being] “the Infinite One,” nevertheless in that way it is rescued from the image brought about by the Divine height, [which] leads [the spirit] to be impressed [with a sense of] nothingness. And [instead the spirit] is filled with an endless light of being.

Paragraph 86

[Listen,] authors and all of the nation’s spiritual activists in whose spirit nests a concern for the existence of our nation in its material and spiritual form: we seek “counsels from afar,” counsels that are certainly good—[i.e.,] expansion of the [Hebrew] language and [its] literature—as [we] look for ways to inspire love for Israelite national feeling and elevate [that feeling].
But together with [these] counsels from afar that are [seemingly] new—although in truth they were already among us in the past, but aged during the days of [our] national slumber and insensibility—we must strengthen as well the nearby counsel, the counsel that is “in our hands and between our eyes”: to guard the laws of Judaism, which [affect] the entire nation. All of these [laws] come from the source of [the nation’s] essential life and give [the nation its] essential life [because], when they are kept and guarded, they guard [the nation’s] spiritual and practical character.

Paragraph 87

When a person sails in the heights of Divine thought, [his] soul is elevated. A person can reach [those heights] with the freedom of his spirit and the might of his imagination. [With that freedom and might,] a small gleam and slight spark of the splendid radiance of the universal goal of all of the good that is stored in all of existence, in the beginning of [God’s] thought and at the end of [His] deed, sparkles in his heart.
In accordance with the degree [to which a person] cleanses [his] practical being and character, and in accordance with the degree to which [he] purifies [his] intellect and cleanses [his] understanding, lucid closeness to the Divine enters his heart and mind, and he rises to the heights, he rises to the peak, from where he gazes upon all of the paths of the world, intellectual and practical, and from where he descends, filled with goodness and lovingkindness, filled with might and splendor, and he shepherds with love the flock of Hashem, “flocks of men” (Ezekiel 36:38).

Paragraph 88

Faith in God gives people happiness, [but] only to the extent that the Divine greatness is studied and learned by that significant sector [of people] that is fit to [do] so, because then the soul is illuminated by the supernal light, since it clings with complete love and knowledge to the Life of lives. And [then] all feelings, concepts, and deeds are refined.
But when [this sector of people] ignores the supernal Torah—[a teaching] that leads to the recognition of God’s greatness and to a supernal perfection that is infinite and priceless—faith itself is blemished. It does not produce the good fruit that it should produce, and it does not openly raise souls from their lowness.
Then faith falls, and those who derogate it and desecrate it multiply. And it will only return to its vigor when the most elevated righteous people, the strong and wise among human beings most perfected in the knowledge of God, will strengthen themselves tremendously to intensify [their] yearning to examine the greatness of Hashem in all major pathways, intellectual and ethical, until faith will be elevated and it will emerge from its darkness to great light, and it will be a source of life for all of the highest and most refined souls in the world, as is the true nature [of faith]. And so its honor and preciousness will return to it as well in all human avenues.
And that which concerns [the people of] at this time is the entirety of the nation’s last resort: to restore its preciousness of pure, Divine faith, which is the entire foundation of its life.

Paragraph 89

The inner soul that invigorates socialist doctrine in its present form is the light of the practical Torah in its full purity and character.
But the doctrine itself is in the midst of its growth, and it does not yet know its fundamental essence.
However, days will come when it will be an established institution on behalf of the fortitude of the Torah and the mitzvot in their full exaltedness and purity.

Paragraph 90

Anarchism comes from a higher foundation than does socialism.
[Anarchism] is not a foundation for the practical Torah and for keeping [the Torah], but for supernal clinging to the Divine beyond all positive deed and order.
Therefore, it is farther [removed] from its source—which stands very far [above] the lowliness of present-day life—than socialism is. And [anarchism,] in its present state and in the state of life at present, is entirely disorderly, despite the exalted Divine spark hidden within it.

Paragraph 91

It is very harmful to pious people, those who are filled with the might of Hashem, to bond spiritually with base people who only have an external fear [of God] and who are filled with a miserable dread and lowly moroseness that spreads across the entire span of their spiritual lives.
Very great is the suffering of [a pious person’s] soul [when he] participates with them in conversation, in prayer, and in all matters of holiness. [He] requires an immense amount of preparation to bolster [his] spiritual strength and the Divine, clear light in [his] soul in order to protect himself, so that his soul will not be pulled down by the lowly smallness of people with [this] external fear, who have no powerful desire [for God] but [only] the weakness of their morose dread.

Paragraph 92

The inner light that shines in all existence must build its own world.
It runs along its circuit, paying no attention to its overall connection to the encompassing light outside itself, which is filled with worlds, [paying no attention] even to that which, in accordance with [its] measure, its inner being would be able to discern.
However, its inner being [contains] a permanent supernal yearning to be bound to the surrounding light, which is incomparably greater and vaster than itself.
When [that yearning] intensifies, it reveals the light of teshuvah on [teshuvah’s] supernal level, which is higher than complete righteousness. The inner being [of teshuvah] has never sunken but has always adapted to that which is higher than itself: [to] that which, in its might, encompasses [teshuvah].

Paragraph 93

The individual and the nation cannot guard themselves against the blurring of [their] spiritual form that results from the weight of practical life by running away from it. [This refers to] material actions regarding physical needs and to spiritual actions regarding keeping and knowing obligations of the Torah and mitzvot with all of their precise details, which tremendously fatigue the wise spirit that seeks the light whose brightness is unlimited.
A person is caught by practical life. The more he wishes to be freed from [his] servitude to it, the more it weighs down on him—unless he accommodates himself to it in a structured form so that it cannot darken the noble light of [his] spiritual life.
[A person] must accommodate himself to material, practical life by means of a good perspective and proper alacrity [based on] the foundation of rectifying [his] income [so that he will earn a living] honorably and in a permissible manner, and [by means of] properly treating [himself] in guarding the health of [his] body and spirit.
And he must accommodate himself to practical spiritual life by accustoming himself to review halachot with a broad perspective regarding their foundations and reasons, without growing too entangled by arguments and subtleties, but learning [in order] to equip himself with clear knowledge. That will remove the yoke of a confused mind and an intimidated spirit, which alarms the heart of every person who gropes in the dark, [and] which vitiates the heart and dejects the spirit—something that weakens the life of the soul so that it [cannot] grow stronger with its Divine light.

Paragraph 94

A person who is connected with love to the entire whole and who desires its rectification and goodness is connected as well to the evil [individuals] and sinners in [that whole]. This [creates] an opening for [the creation of] a blemish in the holiness of [his] pure soul, which desires only holiness and true goodness. Nevertheless, the spirit of the righteous person who loves the whole—with a love of [all] creatures, a love of mankind, and in particular a love of Israel—grows stronger, until he is not intimidated by anything, not even [the fear that] he will [contract] a spiritual blemish. In the end, he purifies himself so thoroughly that he connects himself to the concentrated goodness of the entire whole—[and] in truth, the totality of the whole is always good: “Hashem is good to <i>all</i>” (Psalms 145:9)—and he is elevated yet more as a result of this love.
And as a result of the elevation of his spirit, the whole is elevated as well, until even the individual evil parts of the whole are ameliorated because of [their] connection to the spirit of the righteous person, who truly loves the whole of them.
But such a person, whose way of service this is, must pure himself greatly. And he must be alert and careful so that his deeds, his ideas, and all of his feelings will truly be dedicated to the goodness of the entire whole. [This] is in truth what we can understand [as fulfilling] that which is termed “the will of Hashem.” [This person’s] spiritual thought is then united with the unity of the whole, and no evil will befall it.
But if the spirit of a person who comes to connect himself to the love of the whole is enveloped within him in his own self-interested motives, [then] although he also possesses sparks of purity of the love of the whole, his soul is not properly focused and unified, and so his connection with the whole is unstable, and it is possible that his ability [to form a] connection will be directed to the inferior and evil aspect of the whole. And [then] the good and special quality of the whole will distance itself from connecting [with] his soul. At that point, this connection [between a person and the whole] is truly blemished.
And so we find a natural feeling in many people, people who fear [God] and [know] Torah, [of] only wanting to connect themselves to [and] love good people and [to connect themselves only] to the special quality of [our] nation.
That is truly a proper path for all of those who have not been properly purified.
But that is not the path of Hashem that is fitting for those whose spirit is whole, who have the power to purify themselves and their dispositions. [These people] are obligated—in addition to [being obligated to possess] an extra love for the special quality of [our] nation—to love the entire whole, and to look forward to its salvation in its totality, to the salvation of all of the individuals of the entire whole, without any distinction whatsoever. [Even] if they find in their spirit any spiritual descent or lack as a result of [their] connection to the entire whole because of its fallen parts, they will not turn back from [this] overall path of Hashem that is fitting for them. They will have the alertness to acquire the proper purification, so that they will be able to connect themselves to the entire whole from the aspect of the concentrated goodness of Hashem, the true goodness, that rests in it. Then their noble love will not cause them any blemish and descent at all, but rather ascent and augmented purity, might and holiness.

Paragraph 95

It is natural that according to the typical outlook, the understanding of Divinity that comes from the monotheistic view—which is the most widespread outlook [regarding matters] including [that of] the aspect of faith—will sometimes lead a person to [grow] depressed and [cause] his spirit to weaken, because of the languor that enters his spirit when he views himself as a being that is controlled, bounded and weak, far from Divine wholeness, which shines with the light of its powerful beauty.
In particular, [his] weakness is aroused because [his] ethical failings come to the fore in [his] spirit when compares the status of the human being to the Divine perfection in regard to justice and ethics.
However, this weakness is liable to decrease to the extent that he finds that he is firm in terms of his ethics, actions, and character.
But even then, [this] weakness is not entirely ameliorated, because of [his] ongoing appraisal of [his] mortal smallness as compared to the Divine greatness, which overwhelms [a person’s] most expansive conception with its infinite immenseness.

Paragraph 96

Less enfeebling than this [above] view is the monotheistic view that tends to a Spinozism purified of its dross—[a view] many of whose aspects are emphasized in the intellectual [teachings] of the new Hasidism. [This view states] that there is nothing besides Divinity.
A person finds that, if there is nothing in him that is intrinsic, then when in his imagination he is torn away from the perfection of the Divine infinity he is certainly mortal and feeble, and he is nothing. He is a “nothing” even more than the nothingness of relative nullification that comes as a result of the former visualization [of standard monotheism].
[With standard monotheism,] he is considered to indeed possess some independent existence within his limitation and [within] the arena of his drives, awareness, feelings and predilections—except that his world is so immeasurably small that it is weakness and nothingness compared to the greatness of the Divine endlessness. However, this is not, in essence, a complete and absolute nothingness.
That is unlike the latter view, which explains that there is nothing outside absolute Divinity. According to [this], a person’s immersion in his personal predilections—which rely on a view of life that there is some particular reality that exists intrinsically [within him], even if in the smallest form—is mere vanity and errant emptiness.
It would seem that the depth of [such a] view of the world would weaken a person’s spirit even more than the first, [standard monotheistic viewpoint]. Nevertheless that is not so. Rather, this latter [viewpoint] immediately restores to a person the might of his eternity. It does nothing but encourage him not to forget the truth of his being, and [to remind him] that he must distance himself from all ways of life that come from the errant thought of the [inherent] existence of his particular being, whose spirituality is torn away from the Divine Infinite One. But since he strides on this road, he has nothing more of existence to vanquish except [to overcome] false imagination. And [then] he is happy in the Infinite One.
However, in truth, this work is not as easy as the imagination may visualize it. Emerging to freedom from the imprisonment of the imagination is work no less difficult than emerging to freedom from some actual imprisonment. Nevertheless, in the end, [this panentheism] has a spirit mightier than [that of] the former, [standard monotheistic] thought.
However, it is only possible to approach [panentheism] by means of greatly familiarizing [oneself] with and [engaging in] the purest intellectual learning that is possible regarding the former view [of standard monotheism].
Then [the former, standard monotheistic thought] clothes the latter, [panentheistic] thought in the light of all of the details [of the former view], and [the former view] becomes a receptacle and palace for [the latter view]: “Hashem is in His holy palace” (Psalms 11:4).

Paragraph 97

However, although the intellectual and emotional-poetic world is more purified and elevated by the latter, [panentheistic type of] thought, which is filled with the light of humility and the nullification of being, the world of action cannot proceed on its way in keeping with this constantly [ongoing] supernal view.
And [so] a person must necessarily lower his light, because he must accommodate himself to the world of action and connect himself to the former thought [of standard monotheism,] which is the “palace.” But [he must do so while maintaining] a clear awareness that [standard monotheism] is not a clear thought in itself and [that it] “has nothing of its own” (<i>Zohar</i>). Rather, it is the outcome in [a person’s] intellect and visualization [coming] from the passage of the supernal thought of the latter, [panentheistic] viewpoint that we mentioned.
Then [this] tangible world is quickened, clarified, and filled with righteousness, and the world of thought gains in strength and rises as it is blessed from its source. And [these two types of thought] unite without cease—because of [their] united viewpoints and [because they share] a center of a unified existence—with a complete unification.

Paragraph 98

The written Torah is the trait of heaven.
That is to say: the beginning of overall guidance [provided by] the totality of the Torah and the new path that came about [at the giving of the Torah] as a result of the mitzvot in their totality could not have been revealed, due to the [relatively low level of] Divine spiritual power revealed in the essential inner being of the nation [of Israel]. [That is] because [the written Torah was] something higher than [the nation].
[Therefore,] it was precisely a supernal soul—[Moses]—who rose to the Divine height on a clear and supernal level that the spirit of the nation in its totality could not yet reach. [That soul] was able to reveal the light of the written Torah in the world. “Moses rose to God” (Exodus 19:3).
Then, after the Divine image was stamped in the spirit of the nation and [the nation] acquired this as [its] new nature, it [brought about and] brings about all of the branches [of the oral Torah] in keeping with its spirit, [as the oral Torah] branches out from the Divine source.
And it is no wonder that the nation’s great spirit, which continuously wells from its Divine flow, which is higher than the nature of [the nation’s] essence, is incorporated, in its supernal, original aspect, [into that wellspring].
And the totality of the [nation’s] spirit, and the branches of its details as they develop in the nation, all are viewed from and gain prominence [due to their] Divine, supernal aspect, the heavenly aspect, from where the written Torah was given to Moses, [as part of] the totality of [that spirit being] impressed into the nation, together with its details.
“Moses ceased (<i>kalot</i>) [constructing the tabernacle]” (Numbers 7:1)—[“the people of Israel were like a bride (<i>kalah</i>) entering under the wedding canopy” (Midrash)]—with all of its ceremonies.

Paragraph 99

[People with] great souls do not have surcease from dread and depression until they reach the level for which they are destined—from the essence of their nature and the root from which they are quarried—of being incorporated, entirely and always, into the Divine light, in the great radiance of a clear awareness and the splendid desire of a tremendous will.
Everything that is lower in [terms of] that does not satisfy their hunger and does not soothe their spirit.

Paragraph 100

[In the realm of] Divinity, time is eternal. Therefore, there is no time. Nevertheless, [that no-time] does not lack any quality that time possesses in being time.
[In the realm of Divinity,] boundary exists in the infinite, [where] it is not boundary. But nevertheless, it does not lack any quality that boundary possesses in being boundary.
[In the realm of Divinity,] change is sameness. Nevertheless. it does not lack the quality that change possesses.
We can speak about the concept of Divinity in terms of what we understand from the aspect of time, boundary, and change. And we know that speech is from the aspect of eternity, infinity, and sameness.
And everything that appears within time, boundary, and change is the unclear lens, which receives from eternity, infinity, and sameness, which are the clear lens.

Paragraph 101

[People] with great souls cannot be separated from the most encompassing totality. Their constant, entire desire and aspiration is the good of the entire whole: the whole in its full breadth, height, and depth.
In truth, the whole is filled with particulars beyond calculation: particular individuals and particular societies. The whole is crowned only when it is filled with the perfection of its particular individuals and its groups, small and large. These perfect [the whole].
The supernal totality, which perfects everything, is placed in the movement of [our] knowledge of Hashem and [our] love of Hashem, which necessarily emerges from [the supernal totality] in accordance with the size of [the movement’s] acquisition [of that knowledge and love] and its [spiritual] wealth.
When [our] knowledge of Hashem [allied] with [our] vast love is filled with its true light, according to the level of each soul—in keeping with what it can bear and receive—the absolute light [of that knowledge] illuminates [our] “love of the world”: [i.e., our] love for all worlds, all creatures, and the entire circle of their lives and existence.
Love for all existence fills the heart of those who are good: the pious among beings and among human beings. They look forward to the happiness of the all. They hope for the light and joy of the all. They draw [their] love for all existence, multi-hued with the multiplicity of its creatures, from [their] supernal love for Hashem, from [their] love for the absolute and complete perfection of the Cause of all, Maker of all, and Giver of life to all.
When love descends from the world of Emanation (<i>atzilut</i>) to the world of Creation (<i>beriah</i>), it descends as it divides into details of details, into oppositions and contradictions, into the need for constriction and diminishment of level and love, into every particular detail for the sake of another detail, into many details for the sake of many others, and into details in general because [they possess an] overall totality.
The shining lens of love stands at the height of the world, in the world of Divinity, in a place where there are no contradictions, boundaries and oppositions, [but] only happiness and goodness, and breadth without end.
When its offspring, the love [within} worlds, draws sustenance from it, [the latter] has much of [the former’s] nature. It too does not tolerate in its descent any stinginess and meanness. When it must constrict itself, it constricts love with love, [and] it borders good with good.
When [people who] pour forth love see the world—in particular, [the world of] the living—filled with altercations, hostilities, persecutions and oppositions, they immediately yearn to participate with all their lives in aspirations that [will] lead to the integration of living beings and their unification, their peace and their tranquility.
They feel and know that the closeness to God for which they yearn in the fullness of their souls leads them solely to their unification with the whole and on behalf of the whole.
When they come to the avenues of human beings and find divisions of nations, religions, sects and opposing aspirations, they strive with all their might to integrate the all, to consolidate and unite.
With the healthy spiritual sense of their pure souls, which soar with a Divine flight above all straits, they recognize that all of the details must be full, that best societal structures need to rise, and [that these structures must] congregate with all of the happiness of their individuals in the light of perfect life. They want every detail to be protected and to rise, and the entire whole [to be] united and filled with peace.
When they come to their own nation and their heart is connected in the entire depth of their lives with its happiness, its eternity and its elevations, and they find it taken apart and disassembled, divided into many divisions, they cannot unite with a total unity with any division, because they desire to unite with the entire nation: its entirety in its totality, in all of its fullness and goodness.

Paragraph 102

Clinging to Hashem is humanity’s most natural yearning. It is developed in an intellectual and emotional form, whereas in all [other] existence it is in a mute and deaf form, in a potential form.
The character of the nation of Israel took this yearning for itself as the foundation of its national life, in keeping with its historical destiny.
The yearning for absolute clinging to the living God, to the light of the Infinite One, can have no substitute in the nature of existence.
Just as we must live, receive sustenance, and grow, so must we cling to Hashem.
The clinging that is demanded of us in all the fullness of our soul must continuously develop in us, continuously deepen in feeling, continuously clarify its recognition and understanding.
By no means can humanity and all existence live without the flow of yearning to cling to the Divine that lives always within it, although in a sealed and locked manner.
Humanity’s childhood, the days when darkness was thick and coarse, placed [types of] foundations of life in the world that prevented clinging to the Divine to emerge with all of the fullness of the light [of that clinging].
One cannot imagine the suffering of the universal, overall soul and the inner soul’s suffering of every living being and of every person, over the spiritual pressure, over the withholding of the good hidden in it, that shines so much, that refines so much, that revives a life of breadth, a life of eternity, a life of height and might.
[Each living being] must have [that life. That life] is the essence of its nature and being. [But] human weakness comes and makes mute gods, a material divinity, crude and guzzling, limited and lacking, and it seals all of the cracks.
We envision a great soul, huge in the entire fullness of its aspirations, its mighty yearning for freedom and light, its strong suffering, its intense pain over an insulted world. [That is] the soul of Abraham. How embittered it is! It sees the happiness, the light that is prepared for all, for all living [beings], for every soul, the Divine breadth that calls to being: “Shine forth!,” that calls to every detail: “Be filled with happiness, greatness, height and serenity, goodness and might, love and pleasantness!”
[But] the wells are sealed. “The Philistines have closed them and filled them with earth” (Genesis 26:19).
How [this] lion breaks free from [his] imprisonment, how he takes his cudgel in [his] wrath, breaks the [idolatrous] images, calls powerfully for light, for one God, “the God of the world” (ibid. 21:33)!

Paragraph 103

From the depths of [its] spirit, Israel will call out that which [Abraham,] the “rock from which it is quarried,” called out, from the depths of [his] recognition of light and happiness, from the depths of [his] compassion for every tormented soul, for every struggling being. [It will call out to its] national, societal and ethical life, which is proceeding on paths filled [with] tangled thorns, lacking a living wellspring within itself, lacking permission to yearn. [It will call on all of these] to seek the entire soul of existence, which cries out in its pangs: “Seek me, search for me—and live!”
[People] have imitated [that search] on paths of darkness. With a heart filled with obsequiousness and weakness, they have stepped forward to exalt the King of worlds, [but only] as though to fulfill an obligation of proper behavior, regarding [His] greatness, might [and] vigor.
Israel must not speak this way! Such servility is lowly in the eyes of [the people of Israel]. Although many individuals among [the people of Israel] need [that lowly sort of servitude], this is not the spirit of the nation, [which is] “an eternal nation, a sturdy nation” (Jeremiah 5:15), a nation that calls forcefully for the light of Hashem and the vigor of life.
From within itself, [the nation] brings forth a spirit of destruction to eradicate even the good that is lowly, an imitation that descended from outside [Israel’s] boundary [and entered] its inner being. “When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the spirit of Hashem shall lift up a banner against him” (cf. Isaiah 59:19, Sanhedrin 98a).
With a flaming soul filled with life and eternal might, [the nation] will awaken. [It will] rise like a lion and declare as with the sound of the roaring sea: “Behold the light, the voice of the living God that calls me from the depth of my life, behold the light of eternal freedom for all existence, which comes and flashes from the light of Hashem upon Zion, upon the place of the Valley of Vision, where the word of the living God began to be heard like the voice of the lion!”

Paragraph 104

All of the humble of the land will hear, all of the non-believers of the world will listen. All of those who have a spark of life will return. Souls will rise from the depths of the earth. The unfortunate will ascend from the farthest reaches of the pit. Those lost in the land of Assyria and those cast away in the land of Egypt will come and bow to Hashem on the holy mountain in Jerusalem (cf. Isaiah 27:13).

Paragraph 105

They will bow and [then] rise, filled with vigor. They will melt away and [then] be renewed, valiant with light and strength.
Troops upon troops with tremendous hearts will arise. [They will] call out: “Behold, a nation rises! The life force of a people has begun [to flow, a nation] that will give impetus to the stream of Godly life in all worlds, a forceful nation that in its fortitude paves a path in the storming sea, that paves roads of the world for a dynamic life of clinging to God!”

Paragraph 106

[A person] must always purify [his] thought about Godliness so that it will be clear—without the dross of false delusions, empty apprehensions, evil traits, and deficiencies and failings.
The more [a person] purifies the most fundamental base within his spirit, the more will [his] clinging to the Divine with [his] emotions and with the feelings of [his] heart have the effect of increasing [his ability] to guide the entire course of [his] life on a straight path.

Paragraph 107

When we think about God without intellect and without Torah, [that] idea leads to a dark image filled with turmoil and emptiness. Then, when a person comes to subjugate himself to serve God in keeping with [this] earlier, empty concept, he loses the radiance of his world because he is connecting himself to words of turmoil and fleeting vapors.
When this continues over the course of a number of generations, heresy necessarily emerges in the [people’s] ethos to uproot the memory of God and all of the institutions of the service of God.
But what does it uproot? Merely emptiness and words of hopelessness, which only separate a person from the light of the God of truth.
And upon the wreckages ruined by heresy’s devastations, the elevated knowledge of God builds its palace.

Paragraph 108

It is impossible to fully appreciate the necessity of practical teshuvah (in rectifying one’s deeds in accordance with the Torah and absolute righteousness) so as to [attain] the supernal qualities of the elevation of the soul—of the community and of the individual.
That distillation [of teshuvah] into practicality encompasses within its single smallest point multitudes upon multitudes of expansive ideals and thoughts, which qualify [this distillation to act] in the world and in life.
When [that practical distillation] is defective, the treasury of all expansive ideals is removed from the entire world. Those [ideals] have the same relationship to [the world] as does the etheric expanse of millions of cubic [measures] as they are squeezed together in one physical atom to give it its crystallized form.

Paragraph 109

The development of the spirit of man prepares the essence of his mind and his innermost desire to yearn for the complete good—i.e., the Divine good. [That yearning] is the basis of the goal [that one will attain] all Divine revelation and that the Torah and prophecy will have an influence on the world.
In early days, humanity’s overall intellect was less developed, and its desire was more barbaric. At that time, the Divine vision was entirely dedicated to [having man] spurn the intransigent intellect—which was subservient only to animal desires—in the whole of human society, and to [having man] constantly reject [his] natural desire, which was aroused and directed particularly to ugliness and sin.
The refinement of the world throughout the entire course of the generations—[coming about] in consequence of the most supernal refinement of the revelations of God’s Presence in Israel and in consequence of occurrences of the times, the growth of societal bonds, and the expansion of the sciences—greatly purified the human spirit, until [today, when], although [man’s] purification has not yet been completed, at any rate a large portion of his thoughts and the yearning of his natural will are directed of their own to the Divine goodness.
And correlating to the portion that has already been cleansed, liberalism necessarily spreads, and anarchy takes hold.
When tradition and religion come—even in their most pristine form—[with the aim of] conquering this distilled part [of the human spirit], they will not succeed. Rather, they must help the spirit of man in its pristine core to proceed on its road that it has already paved, and [from there] to direct [man’s] purpose corresponding to those parts of the spirit of [his] human knowledge and [his] will that have not yet been refined, [but] which still remain in their primitive state, as [they were] in earlier days.
The more the refined parts [possess an] effervescent movement, the greater the danger [inherent] within them. [That is because,] when the unrefined parts, the many remnants of barbarity, continue in their natural disordered state, the rectified aspect of the spirit of man cloaks them with the wing of its imagination, placing an overlay of flashing glitter on all of the abomination and falsehood.
[The following] is the holy work of those who serve Hashem to the end of days: [to help] the spirit of impurity pass away entirely, [so that] the radiance of humanity and the world will be revealed in the beauty of its might, under the sovereignty of the Almighty.

Paragraph 110

The best and most authentic way of [engaging in] teshuvah, [a way that] flows from the light of Torah within the world, is to learn and review the monetary laws and all of the [other] laws regarding interactions between people as found in <i>Choshen Mishpat</i>, with the clearest overall knowledge and the most straightforward and broad incisiveness possible.
This rectifies all of the obstacles of the heart [that occur] in [a person’s] life, establishes Divine justice upon its [most] stable basis, and removes the wound of doubt and confusion from [a person’s] soul, as with its clear light it illuminates [his] pathway in practical life.
However, [a person] must always develop [his] heart and mind by means of the other parts of Torah—in particular, by means of the moral and contemplative influence, which is strong and broad, [as found] in the dew of light of the inner thoughts within lofty, Divine modes of comprehension. As a result, [his] soul will be capable of clinging tightly to the Divine justice within the legal portion of the Torah of life.
Then this [legal] field of study will come to [a person’s soul] like oil upon its bones, uplifting and elevating it.

Paragraph 111

It is completely impossible that we will not look at and study matters of Godliness.
We have no need at all to consider how this study [will] affect us, or what benefit [will] come of it. We do not seek benefit regarding [that which is] the source of all goals.
[A person’s] soul grows barren and gaunt as a result of [his] abandoning Divine study, and afterwards as a result of [his] extended acclimatization to arid and inconsequential thoughts. It loses [its] ability [to engage in] Divine study, which becomes difficult and foreign to it. And consequently it sinks into the depth of griefs and the corruption of [its] character traits, deeds, and concepts.
It is true that not all people are competent [to engage in] Divine study. But those who are capable are the fruit of the overall soul of humanity. When they actualize their ability, the overall soul of humanity is elevated and soars. Covertly, [people’s] deeds and character traits are rectified, [their] ways of life are straightened in consequence of the mindful activity of the righteous people, wise of heart, who were created to always look upward—those with precious qualities, who grow enthusiastic regarding nothing in [this] world [but] only regarding the delight of Divine study in all of its radiance and all of its sectors.
There is a person who, from his exalted station, sends forth his branches and illuminates from his refined holiness other studies as well. Then the phenomenon of learning Torah for its own sake comes to light, and the entire Torah and all wisdom, inquiry and knowledge, are elevated in the light of the supernal Torah, the heavenly Torah, whose character is the manifestation of the pleasantness of Hashem.
This person, the chosen of Hashem, looks at the vessels: the powers of creativity that act in existence to the entire fullness of its depth, greatness, height, and elevation. He sees the splendor and the goodness in everything.
His ethical quality continuously expands because he derives his life from the source of justice and uprightness. The wisdom of his heart broadens because he derives sustenance constantly from the breasts of the comprehensions of the Divine radiance.

Paragraph 112

The more a person studies Hashem’s works, directs his heart to recognize Divine perfection through [those works], acquires clearer concepts regarding the ways of life [when a person possesses] pure ethics and perfection of the most excellent deeds, then the more will the Divine light [shine] on him, and inner clarifications of the delight of the Divine perfection will begin to flow in [his] inner being, and his brain and heart will be filled with light and a supernal pleasantness that fill [his] entire soul and entire environment with purity and righteous humility, with love of people, uprightness, fairness, and joy [that spreads through all] worlds, [a joy] partnered with the abundance of the gladness of Hashem [flowing] from His place.

Paragraph 113

The more that the soul’s revelations regarding Divine perfection rise, the more they are cleansed and removed from the character of expression and speech. No expression of tongue or movement of the lips will contain them, no eloquence of expression will arrange them, and all poetry will be inadequate to relate their magnificent radiance.
Then a person is mute, as “his lips kiss each other” (Proverbs 24:26). Deep within [his] heart are revealed light, power, and magnificence, elevated might and supernal compassion for all existence, an abundant flow of lovingkindness and love, and an unimaginable generosity of heart in [his] every deed of practical charity.
The pleasantness of this soul sweetens life overall. It removes the painful sting of the curse placed upon human life because of the sin and foolishness of man, because of the lowliness and gloom of his spirit.
The word that emerges from this heart [of wisdom,] which is a gift [to man] (cf. Ecclesiastes 7:7), at the time of its elevation, at the time that it sits firm in the heights of the loftiness of Divine lovingkindness, is great and vibrant, active and decisive. [Then] “you will decree a word and it will be established for you, and light will shine upon your way” (Job 22:28).
[Then] the light continuously grows.
And when it begins to be hidden, the righteous person hurries to [engage in] practical charity, to [learn] Torah and serve [God], to [occupy himself in providing] material goodness and lovingkindness, until the supernal radiance from the supernal hiding place will again be revealed through him.

Paragraph 114

In the fullness of our soul, we sense the necessity of absolute goodness, the impossibility of its not existing, and the unceasing longing in the depths of our heart to rise to it, to approach its heights, to gaze upon its pleasantness.
We feel that the fulfillment of this absolute goodness in the completeness of its being—free of every boundary, of every condition and ordinance, of every definition and alteration—is a universal fulfillment.
The only way to fulfill our hopes for such goodness is to gaze—to the [greatest] extent possible—upon the sparks of its radiance. Then strength and life, eternity and splendor shall descend to us and fill us.
After all this vision, we still remain thirsty for goodness to ascend. We still do not embrace the full circumference of goodness in its wholeness. We shall do so only when we shall see, besides the fulfillment of goodness, an ascent of goodness: a constant blossoming, an increase of strength, an ascent without limitations, without standstill.
The fulfillment of our ideal-oriented thirst will show us how to distinguish between the divine light and the worldly light, which draws life from its source.
The divine light satiates our exalted thirst for absolute goodness in its heights.
The worldly light, which grows ever brighter and which constantly rises, drawing from the life of its source, will satisfy us with the goodness of ascent, of increase of might, of additional rising—for which we so deeply thirst and yearn.
We will not be compelled to slake our thirst for knowledge and goodness—when they are united, making all existence understood, making xthe secret of its ethical grandeur understood—with a dry conclusion that existence and decay are the final endpoint; a conclusion that leaves us mortified and shaken, filled with desperation about an on-going, unfolding process that depresses our spirit with the groan that “there is nothing new under the sun.”
We rise above everything to the simple vision that our senses could grasp from existence only superficially. We step forward spiritually, striding higher than the sun. Then we pronounce that there is nothing old: everything blossoms, everything rises, everything constantly increases light and life.
Nor does the magnificent spirit fall when it sees that the path of ascent is circuitous, incorporating ascents and descents, advances and very great retreats—for the descents and retreats are filled with the spirit of ascent and advance.
The comprehension of this progress—as it approaches completion, becoming well-integrated in a knowledgeable, ethical life, as it is blessed and emerges from immaturity so that it is not eaten unripe—lifts the human spirit to the heights of divine light. It makes us assimilate within ourselves the inner goal of the knowledge of God—free of every ordinance and boundary—that exists within the treasure-house of the soul of Israel, that is revealed through the divine manifestation unique to Israel, which is the highest blossoming of the stream of light of the human soul in the midst of all the nations.
This constant progress fills us with an idealistic, ethical outlook regarding all of existence. It brings us to the fullness of a divine, knowing, and comprehending light that unites our existence with the light of the Life of worlds, with the ultimate purity and ethics, strength and power in all their fullness.
The honor of God, wrapped in the breadth of Creation in all its rich and varied hues, becomes known to us in its ideal radiance, growing constantly.
“May His great name be magnified and sanctified.”

Paragraph 115

A person’s love for himself might remain solely on its bottom-most level, natural and low. [And] due to its smallness, it is liable to decay and deviate, to become a foundation for evil deeds and evil qualities. And in keeping with the measure of a person’s ability, so can he in his own corruption corrupt everything else.
[But] that love can also be holy and ideal the more that a person purifies himself, elevates his mind and intellect, and establishes his traits and his deeds to [be on] the more exalted and upright side.
When a person purifies himself, and the aspect of good in him vanquishes his character, his gaze at all existence shines more and rejoices more, and existence finds favor in his eyes, because he looks at it from his essential core.
And in truth, existence is very good when the person who looks at it, acts within it, and lives with it is good.
And a person’s goodness is entirely in his control, or at least important parts of it are.
And those parts that a person has the power to bring into the realm of goodness can improve his entire being, until even his parts whose goodness is not in his control will be established for the good. These are the parts and powers that are not under the control of [his] free will. Even though they are planted in this person, in truth they are more connected to the totality of existence—which is entirely transformed to good, adorning itself in pleasing and heartwarming lights when a person illuminates it with his good soul and with his beautiful abilities arranged in accordance with [his soul].

Paragraph 116

The concept of the evolution of existence and of all beings both depresses and elevates our spirit. An elixir of life and a drug of death are immersed together within ourselves
When we turn to the past, we see the degradation that had existed then. We also see that as we stand now—morally, intellectually, [and] physiologically—we surpass that past. Then in one regard, our mind grows self-satisfied, [and] our moral restraints grow feeble. Regarding our present moral level, we claim—when struck by the evil spirit of some desire—that it is beyond our measure, [that controlling it is] much more than can be expected of creatures like us, who come from an animalistic nature and a coarse wildness.
In contrast, the outlook of evolution relating to the future exalts and elevates us: truly, to such a moral height that it is correct that we think of ourselves in accordance with our understanding of the greatness of humanity at the beginning of its existence, of humanity’s divine dwelling-place before its exile—in that primeval era—from the Garden of Eden.
The more we rise in knowledge and wisdom, in learning Torah and in [gaining] good character traits, the more does our moral sense—intellectual and imaginative—soar. We proceed to the future. Automatically and continuously, the concept of evolution acts upon us, straightening our ways and supporting our moral faculties, until we enter palaces of holiness and purity with supernal might, filled with the power of God.
Then, the outlook of the past girds us with a strength [born] of fear: we consider in our heart the terrible degradation of the past. We feel that if we disgrace our ways, we may fall back to that same dark degradation, rather than—by rectifying our private and communal ways and actions—beholding a great light that shines forever, rising without end, substantial before us.

Paragraph 117

[The present] era has brought about the promulgation of perceptions that, as they become widely known, destroy [earlier] perceptions. [Even though the latter] do not intrinsically have a negative relationship with the novel perceptions, due to the factor of [our] habits [of thinking], they are bundled together. [That is because] a person connects all of his thoughts to each other, [and so] when some of them change, that affects [his] entire mental construct.
Only with awareness and deliberation can a person establish boundaries to distinguish how far the change [brought about by] new perceptions must properly reach, and at what point their capacity ceases.
It is the nature of the intellect—and of the spirit’s visualization in general—to feel in its entirety [any] change in one of its parts. That is the nature of its life. This leads to [its] improvement and enhancement every time something novel appears in one of its parts.

Paragraph 118

In [our] new era, three principal changes have occurred in the course of human understanding. From these principal [changes], many new branches have diverged.
Because [people] do not focus on understanding the principal quality of the essence of these changes in order to know how far [the changes] should spread, so as to lead to other changes in concepts and deeds, these changes, [which are] for the good, have also brought about bewilderment and confusion. [But] that will return to the good together with a stronger understanding—after the proper dissemination of spiritual knowledge—of [human] thinking and the storehouse of concepts.
These three principal changes are:
One: A change in the course of thought regarding society.
Two: [A change] in the course of cosmological thought.
Three: [A change] in the course of thought about evolution.
Understanding human society, including sociology, was a closed topic and a sealed secret to the broad populace in the generations before us, [as were] all of the secrets of practical and abstract wisdom.
Every community and populace was closed within its own sphere. Each individual was affected in a manifest way only by his immediate environment, and every individual and every populace thought in its simplicity in [the following] way: that the great world is only [that which exists] in its own environment, spiritual and physical.
Like all humanity, the children of Israel too were enclosed in their own sphere—and in an even greater measure [than others], for two cogent reasons: (1) because of the many persecutions that [they] constantly endured from the great human world, as far as their eyes could see, and (2) because of the principal difference in the ways of spiritual and practical life between us and the vast masses of the nations under all the heavens, across all time.

Paragraph 119

[Those] rare individuals who possess a great awareness have always known the secret of spiritual unity. They have known that the spirit of man is [a single] universal spirit. No matter how much a multitude of spiritual and physical differences acts to differentiate one individual from another, one societal group from another, beyond all of [these] differences is the intrinsic unity among them. Thoughts influence and are influenced without cease, and the structures of life constantly enter into alignment. The purpose of [this] alignment is certainly to constantly gather [all] that is exceptionally good, exceptionally healthy, and especially refined in every group and to plant it upon a universally [shared] soil.
But the masses have never glanced beyond their own circle. They have thought that there is no relationship here [with anything outside their circle, that] no faculty of its intimate circle affects and is affected by a foreign environment, and certainly not an environment that is even further away.
Within the circuit of this constricted thought is impressed the form [cast by] the matrix of the masses’] innermost spiritual world. In accordance with this character exists the form of [the masses’] ideal love for everything holy, and their attitude to their [own,] special nation and [to] everything that relates to it: its hopes for the future, the vision of its spirit regarding the concealed worlds that transcend the senses, its outlook on life and death, on freedom and on enslavement, on independence and on obeisance. Everything is woven into the constricted weave of the image of the isolated environment, which [appears to be] the be-all and end-all of existence.

Paragraph 120

[This new] era has completely changed this outlook—not only in the perceptions of enlightened circles, but [in the perceptions] of the circle of the entire populace, from its least to its greatest.
[This new] societal recognition has spiraled and broadened. Each individual feels that he is not isolated, not completely enclosed in an exclusive area, [but] that he affects and is affected by a multitude of circles, many and extended, by various foreign environments, and that he cannot drive off any spirit, saying, “I do not have to take it into account at all,” no matter how far away it may be.
But here, the [need for proper] calculation has grown—[and with that,] confusion has increased.
The requirement to learn how to construct a structure of many hues in the narrow realm of the masses’ regular thought, how to fully retain all of the good in [the masses’] spiritual world without loss after the entire transformation brought about by foreign influence, and how to derive from the all only the good and the true, the straight and the upright—that requirement has grown exceedingly. And it can be satisfied only by means of a major influence [brought about by] explanations of profound, good spiritual ideas. And this can only be realized by establishing a multitude of good and worthy spiritual teachers filled with knowledge and with good, uplifted feeling, [people] who can exert an influence even [to those] on the outside in the most desirable manner.

Paragraph 121

[The new] thinking about the cosmos has also had the effect of causing a great change in the course of [people’s] spiritual lives.
The ideas that were [once] absorbed from the understanding of the overall universe as a small [entity], in keeping with the old astronomical [model showing the universe as being] in a state of quiet and smallness, mirrored the smallness [associated with people’s] constricted [sense of] environment.
The new, overall spirit that has come in consequence of the scientific expansion of what [we] can perceive of tangible existence will necessarily, as it spreads among the broad populace, create a new image of the spiritual universe and the entire connectivity of its thoughts.
Considerable learning will be needed [to know] how to establish everything anew with the ultimate rectification while [achieving] the greatest success in retaining all of the fundamental goodness of the old.
And how this will be done? [It will be accomplished] in accordance with ongoing learning in the depths of the spirit. This will generate a great amount of explanations that will [allow] the entire content of the spiritual [universe] to shine. More light will be added by the goodness gathered in from the breadth of all of the new understandings after they come into alignment with all the goodness stored in all of the old [wisdom] in accordance with [that wisdom’s] pure form.

Paragraph 122

The course of thought regarding evolution, which has grown well-known in all avenues in consequence of the new natural sciences, has brought about a great revolution in the orbit of [people’s] customary thoughts.
[This is so] not [only] regarding rarified individuals, intellectuals, and thinkers. They have always perceived a graduated series of development, even in spiritual existence, which [they] view with a review [that reveals that which is] most hidden. They do not find it strange to understand the comparison [of spirituality and physicality] here as well, regarding the physical evolution of the tangible world: that it is fitting that the revelation [of the physical world] should align with the spiritual development of existence, which lacks not even a single level due [to any] leap and gap. But the populace was not accustomed to understand evolution with a complete and encompassing conception, and it could not connect its own spiritual world to it. The difficulty in establishing the thought of the common people in [regard to this] does not lie in aligning Torah verses or other traditional statements with the idea of evolution. That work is quite easy. Everyone knows that metaphor, riddle, and allusion govern everywhere in these matters, which are the secret of the world. The common people are used to hearing the brief assertion that this verse or that statement is part of the secrets of the Torah, going beyond its simple meaning, and [the people’s] mind is set at rest. And this parallels the review of the thinker [as he] considers the secret of the supernal song that exists in the expression of ancient riddles.
But how may [we] align this entire spiritual connection, of the entire expression of its thoughts that are bound together, in accordance with [something different]: an structure [that consists] of sudden [change] and leaps—[which is something] that rescues [a person’s] thought from soaring [up] into [an area] that lies beyond it—when [the older thoughts] now encounter the new system of evolution, which is growing more well-known and conquering a place in [people’s] hearts?
For that, much light must shine, [so that it] will penetrate all avenues, until [the doctrine of leaps] will appear—in its easy forms—even among the simplest and most common circle [of people].

Paragraph 123

Therefore, the [present] time requires the spreading forth of knowledge: the highest, broadest, and most ideal knowledge.
It is impossible for the coarse form of faith, after it has sunken descent after descent and been clothed in bulky garments of sackcloth, to stand firm.
Who will clothe pure faith [in] the finery fit for it? Who will place on her head that pure diadem that is fitting for the splendor of her sovereignty—if not those great in ability, wise of heart, holy of feeling and pure of spirit, planted in the courtyards of Hashem: the Torah sages dedicated to the thought and toil of the Torah?

Paragraph 124

[When a person] is connected to something of significance, that paves the pathway of [his] life. If that significance is elevated and exalted, [his] pathways of life will accordingly be elevated and exalted. [But] if that significance is low and ignoble, [his] pathways of life will accordingly be low and ignoble. [At any rate], whenever [a person has] an enduring connection to some [matter of] significance, [that will create the] pathways of [his] life.
Simple and natural people are well connected to their physical essence. Their lives have a pathway paved in accordance with their way.
Those who diverge from the boundary of the lowest avenue possess a noble content [in terms of] the aspect of their family life. But [their] connection as well is [to something] natural and physical, and it has much of the coarseness [within] life.
As for those great in knowledge and ethics, people who have been greatly purified and are elevated above the aspirations of the common man, their spiritual connection to the supernal goal in their lives is necessarily set in such a way that their lives have [their own] paved pathway. Their natural connections are not in accordance with all of the measure of the might that is common among the vast populace.
[But] if they will forget their supernal level and they will want to be equal to the regular populace, they will be much lower than it is. The natural connections that suffice to pave the populace’s life do not at all suffice to pave a path for the greatness of soul with [its] multiple abilities [possessed by] people of quality, [who are] consummate in thought and feeling. Only when they stand on their [own] elevated level is the pathway of their lives paved and leveled in a framework more uplifted than [that of] the populace’s pathways. But when they descend from the height of their peak, they can lose [their] way, and [then] they will be more abject in [their] lives than [the most] abject person among the populace.
“Just as when fish in the sea go onto dry land, they immediately die, so too when a Torah sage separates himself from the Torah, he immediately dies” (Avodah Zarah 3b).
Those [people] noble of spirit must necessarily be set within and connected to the house of their lives, filled with light and supernal life.
“He said of his father and his mother, ‘I do not see him,’ and he did not recognize his brothers, and he did not know his children, because they kept Your word and guarded Your covenant” (Deuteronomy 33:9).

Paragraph 125

Usually, the outlook of the outer and inner character of the world contradict each other.
[This] contradiction is of course not constant and uncompromising in its nature. To the contrary, the essential [reason] it is ingrained is to arouse a more intense bonding, [since] only [because of this] can the inner and outer life join together.
Those [people] who have ingrained in them the character of being immersed in the external matters of the world cannot immerse themselves in [its] inner character. They find a tremendous opposition to that in their spirit.
Conversely, it is impossible for those embedded in the inner character of the world to be entirely equable with its outer character. And when they strive to grasp the two types of character together, they begin to feel the pain of the split between them.

Paragraph 126

[A person’s] clear awareness that stands upon the foundation of goodness engenders [his] will.
The more that a [person] refines his good desire, the stronger it becomes. The more [that a person] refines [his awareness of the fact] that the good is truly good, the stronger [his] will becomes.
[And] the intensity of [a person’s] will engenders [his] ability.
From this we learn that awareness, will, and ability are always bound together. And where awareness is unlimited, the will is unlimited and the ability is unlimited as well.

Paragraph 127

Every sin in a person’s fundamental spirit results from a defect in [his] capability: [of his] spirit being weak and lacking the capability to resist the inclination for evil within itself.
As [this person’s] lack of capability manifests itself, it weakens the power of [his] will for the good. The weakness of that will engenders a weakness of [his] awareness, [so that his] recognition of goodness grows blurred.
[A person’s] teshuvah comes after [he attains] understanding, at which time [he] intensifies [his] recognition of goodness. That recognition grows complete as he [also] recognizes evil. “Evil [provides the contrast by means of which] to delineate good” (Sefer Yetzirah 6:2). When a person knows the profundity of evil in its evil, then the profundity of good in its goodness shines more deeply [for him].
As [this person’s] awareness of good grows clearer and the blemish that sin caused—of darkening his awareness—dissipates via the return of [his good] will and the inclination of his spirit to goodness, [his] recognition [of goodness] arouses [in him] an inclination to fortify [his] good will and rescue it from the blemish of sin.
With this, [his] spirit that had been weakened receives its goodness, [allowing] it to raise itself from its descent and to rectify its capability, until its capacity for good is complete.
As a result, a person’s choice becomes free. [Then] he can consider [choosing] goodness without interference.
Thus, the spiritual attraction to goodness (which exists within each person) strengthens the individual’s and community’s resolution for good and establishes the structures of life upon a nucleus of total goodness, whose ultimate expression is the light of Hashem.

Paragraph 128

[A world in which] ethics [is full-fledged] is one of the [prophetic] visions of existence. And [that potential] is embedded as well in the totality of [present-day] existence to the degree that overall existence, requires it. And in that regard, there is a significant relationship between the human spirit, which is rising in its ethical character, and all existence.
As for society—which constitutes an especially noteworthy part of the revelations of existence in comparison to the revelation of existence that exists in individuals—its greatness may be recognized in keeping with the level of the ethical element within it.
And parallel to the ethical resolve within the spiritual character of a society, so does [that society’s] relationship to the great universe in terms of [the latter’s] the ethical dimension continuously grow.
The source of ethics in existence is God’s guidance, which has guided existence and [will continue to] guide it until total revelation.
Those people filled with the mighty [ability] of recognition, of penetrating to the ethical light and recognizing it as the most radiant and beloved soul of existence—even under a multitude of covers of wars and an appalling character that appears to a person in accordance with [his] superficial outlook upon [the soul of existence]—[those people] rise to the highest heights in existence, and their importance in overall existence is magnificent beyond comprehension.
These [people] are those spirits for whom closeness to God is good. The people who possess [this awareness] are filled with Divine valor and might [with which] to rescue many people, and they illuminate people with the light of supernal justice and the torch of uprightness that shines with its great light. They impress upon the entirety [of the universe] the seal of the search for truth and the desire for life with all of its purity and vitality.
In the spiritual laws [governing] existence and in their great richness, [God’s] ethical plan spreads with its full governance. Nor is its spark extinguished in the physical rules [governing existence]. The clear light of the quality that comes from the [supernal] universal justice is mixed into [those physical rules] until all [people will] be fit to influence and receive influence from the source of the light of the ethics distilled in its Divine, pure distillation.

Paragraph 129

There is an evil inclination that is extremely hidden in the depths of the spirit: an envy that rots the bones, that brings weakness and darkness to every idea of light.
[This evil] is a strange [sort of] envy.
Many people do not recognize it, because a number of factors prevent the mouth from speaking about it. But it sleeps. It slumbers in the concealed places of the human spirit. And occasionally it emerges in various shapes, not its true shape, as is the way of all of the outcomes of envy that are clothed only in a foreign garment, and which always bear a foreign name.
This strange [sort of] envy is—envy of God. A person envies God for His infinite happiness, for His absolute perfection.
This envy perverts [his] awareness, darkens [his] thought, seals [his] intellect, and provokes [his] spirit. And when all of [his] means do not suffice to contain its wrath, it ends in absolute heresy, as [this person strives to] remove from [his] pained spirit, consumed with rot, the thorn of envy that pierces [him] terribly.
The only cure for this disease is a supernal illumination of the knowledge of God, with clarity and with proper depth. The particular paths to remove the plague of this envy—with whose removal a person is freed as well from all of the evil consequences of the various garments in which it clothes itself, including the disease of a maddening heresy, which has spread throughout our generation as the disease of the era—these paths are two. One is the path of pure knowledge, and the other [is the path] of ethical knowledge.
The path of [pure] knowledge clarifies [the fact] that the difference between God and the world depends only on knowledge, awareness, and ways of life.
The higher a person’s knowledge, the closer he and the world will come to Divine greatness. With his supernal exaltedness and absolute recognition, he finds that everything is incorporated into God. The individual essence of every detail of existence is nothing but a Divine revelation, which shines before us in various hues. In accordance with that [perspective], all of the Divine happiness is the happiness of all, and [that universal] happiness expands the more that [this] Divine knowledge grows clear.
This is the secret of the supernal delight of comprehending the Divine, as [a person] feels his supernal happiness, his eternal perfection, filled with elation and vigor. And there is no place here for any envy.

Paragraph 130

The second path is [a combination of] knowledge [and] ethics. [According to this view,] the perfection and necessary existence of the Divine [in this world] depend on the measure of [people’s] free [will in attaining] justice. When a person elevates his free will to the measure of full justice [equal to] the elevation of God in His complete desire, with [His] free and absolute justice, he “cleaves to the body of the King” (Zohar I 217a) and he acquires Divine completeness, in that he nullifies himself to the Divine light with inner delight.
Nothing prevents anyone from elevating his free will to the height of Divine justice. In accordance with the degree to which [a person] approaches the measure of Divine justice, he rises and becomes a godly person.
Thus, God must have Divine perfection [in this world] because of His freely-willed justice. [A person’s ability to attain that] is a merit that is equally [accessible] to everyone. [And so] there is no place for envy [of God].

Paragraph 131

[A person] must constantly construct his inner world and unceasingly improve it, even more than [he must] constantly construct [his] outer world.
In a person’s spirit, everything that is in accordance with [his] fundamental inner desire for goodness constitutes [his] inner building. And everything [in his life] from which [his] inner desire stands distant or with which it does not participate constitutes [his] outer building.
Even [a person’s] intellectual awareness is only considered to constitute [his] inner building if [that awareness] improves so much that it directs [his] deepest will. But as long as [a person’s awareness] only envisions and thinks—[but his] heart’s desire in its life does not participate in the depth of this life of envisioning—that is only an outer building. Perfection—whether of an individual [or] of the populace—is not built into [this sort of envisioning life as] a building that will last forever.
When [the pairs of] Torah and fear [of God], wisdom and prayer, awareness and service [of God], constantly come together, they beautify the world: both its inner aspect and its outer aspect.
[But] when one side is missing, there is an equivalent lack in the building: an inner lack or an outer lack.
A person must always transmit [his] states of awareness [to his will] so that they will shake the proclivities of [his] will out of their composure and arouse them for the good.
Then his awareness will not only perfect the outer [aspect] of his spirit but it will also construct his inner world.
This constitutes [a person’s] essential foundation. It is inherent in the series of realizations [that a person has,] which reveal to [his] human understanding matters that are the mystery of the world: sometimes these come [as a result of his] searching [and] seeking, sometimes they come as a result of [his] spirit appearing [to him] in a revelation of knowledge that occurs inside [him], [and] sometimes they come as prophecy and a revelation of God.
The nature of [a person’s] spirit always comes wrapped in forms of various hues, which accompany the essence of [his] awareness. [And these] hues always impart [to his] awareness something of their [own] essence.
[Human] knowledge always struggles regarding how to recognize the inner foundation of awareness. [That knowledge] stumbles on its way a number of times until, over the course of generations and eras, it comes somewhat close to the original entity [that exists] beneath the hues.
[But] why do we have all of these [hues]? Why weren’t the inner states of awareness expressed and recognized in and of themselves?
[The answer is that] when we come to sum up the points of the inner building—which is the most principal foundation of universal betterment—we find that only when states of awareness initially come in [these] hues do they affect the will in accordance with the good purpose within them. Those hues engender tendencies of the desire for good in a complete form, corresponding to the character of the good core of what [a person] searches for in [his] states of awareness.
The more that human knowledge—individual and overall—develops, the more [a person] approaches the inner [being] of [his] states of awareness. But with that, since the hues have engendered the movement of the inner core of [his] states of awareness, which is the tendency of [his] good will [and] ethical element in [his] awareness, this birth multiplies precisely with the removal of the external hues, and with [a person] locating [himself] on a pure source within the essence of [his] awareness.
But if [these] states of awareness would [initially have] come naked, exposed, in their being as they are, then there would have been no place for an awakening of the inner life of [a person’s] spirit. [These] states of awareness would appear in the images of [his] spirit just as the external states of awareness of the senses appear in any person who enters a world that is entirely foreign to him. They indeed make an impression on the network of the nerves of [his] sense of sight, they make their marks on [his] “plaque of life,” but they do not deepen their being in this person, they do not root themselves in [his] soul to bring forth branch and fruit and to be transformed to the essence of his inner bones [and] cause his character to grow.
And woe, woe would it be to the entire world if the character of knowledge, which is the radiance of life, would remain in such a form and would be unchanging, without interruption and no rectification at all. [That would be] the bitter complaint that “I write to them the great things of My Torah, but they consider [these] as foreign” (Hosea 8:12). Instead, by means of the hues comes the hope that “wisdom will come into your heart and knowledge will be pleasant for your spirit” (Proverbs 2:10) “because he who finds Me has found life and he has obtained favor from Hashem” (Proverbs 8:35).

Paragraph 132

The final goal in life is holiness.
Holiness is a supernal entity that has none of the weakness [inherent] in ethics.
Holiness does not battle at all against self-love, which is profoundly embedded in the depth of every living creature. Rather, it situates a person [on the level of] a supernal form [such that,] the more he loves himself, the more the goodness in him will spread over everything: over [his] entire environment, over the entire world, over all being.
The character of a populace can in no way tend to weaken [its] self-love. [That weakening of self-love] possesses nothing but ethical destruction—should that occur—and an inner rotting away that consumes everything.
Therefore, it is impossible to require that an ethical nation should exist in the world, but rather a holy nation, a nation that—the more it strengthens itself, the more it elevates its level within and without—elevates and intensifies light and goodness in the world.
And so the core of goodness in ethics is already incorporated into holiness in the most splendid, fine, and delightful form.

Paragraph 133

Ethics is the entranceway, and holiness is the great hall.
When individuals improve themselves by [attaining] the purity of ethics, [then] the populace, the entirety, is elevated to holiness.
At that point, the public’s ethics shakes off the dust of [self-righteous] demagoguery [that exists] in ethics. And, by gathering together the sparks of ethics in its individual members, it wraps [itself in] the light of holy might. [And that light] rises precisely in consequence of [the public] delving into self-love.
Conversely, should the individuals abandon ethical purity, the torch of the public’s persona will agglomerate into something impure, revealing a terrible monstrosity of a nation “heavy with sin” (Isaiah 1:4), more evil than any evil animal and more depraved than any loathsome creature.

Paragraph 134

A nation that cannot, with the power of its entirety, rise to holiness cannot, from the aspect of its overall soul, influence its children [to turn] toward a pure ethics.
Only a nation in whose spiritual core the character of holiness is concealed helps its children gain purity in ethics, until even the individual will be raised to the heights of holiness.

Paragraph 135

Souls from the world of chaos are great, very great.
They request much of existence. They request that which their receptacles cannot accommodate. They request a very great light.
They cannot endure anything that is limited, apportioned, and assessed.
They descended from their height, from the origin of the propensity of existence to be born. They flared up and [then] grew dim.
Their infinite yearning will not cease. They yearn and fall. They clothe themselves in various garments, they yearn more and more, beyond measure. They see that they are imprisoned in rules, in limited conditions that do not permit [them] to expand endlessly to infinite heights, and [so] they fall into sorrow, into despair, into sadness, into anger—and [then], out of wrath, into evil, into willfulness, into lowliness, into ugliness, into abomination, into destruction, into every evil.
Their animated ferment does not quiet down.
They manifest themselves in the insolent people of the generation.
And most of all, they are revealed during some fin de siècle, in an era before the birth of a world, before the existence of a new and wondrous creation, on the border of the expansion of boundaries, “before the decree” that transcends decrees “is born” (Zephaniah 2:2).
And a storm rages in increased intensity, one breach bursts upon another, insolence overtakes insolence, without any contentment with the entire good treasury of the limited and constricted light, because [that light] does not fulfill everyone’s needs, because it does not remove all masks upon all of the faces of darkness (cf. Isaiah 25:7), because it does not reveal all secrets and it does not satisfy all desires.
[These people] spurn everything: the portion of good, the kernels of a happiness that leads to tranquility and perpetual serenity, that leads to everlasting Eden, to the heights of infinite eternity.
They spurn and they rage, they smash and they eradicate, they descend to graze in the field of strangers, “they please themselves with the children of foreigners” (Isaiah 2:6), they profane the glory of every beauty (cf. Isaiah 23:9), and [they have] no peace.
[But] these tempests will bring about generous rains. These dark clouds will prepare the great lights. “And from darkness and from blackness, the eyes of the blind will see” (Isaiah 29:18).

Paragraph 136

When the soul grows, when it broadens as a result of a breadth of wisdom and knowledge, [then] all small spiritual acquisitions must rise with it. And whereas, in a state of smallness, [these acquisitions] had derived [their] sustenance from a small root, they must [now] be embedded in a state of greatness and elevation, in a great, mighty, and exalted root.

Paragraph 137

With every elevation, there is always a state in which lack precedes being. That manifests itself as a state of descent and spiritual weariness prior to the intensified strength [that comes] from the more elevated source.

Paragraph 138

When a person proceeds in accordance with the naivete of his upbringing, situated in a state of simple faith and an ethical framework that is bound to the fear of punishment and love of reward as the principal factor that impels the entire orbit of his spiritual life, then all of [his] good deeds and good traits derive [their] sustenance from this small and lowly root.
As he rises, he starts to open his eyes, to recognize goodness and light in their true essence. He somewhat forgets himself, his individuality, and he brings himself more [fully] into the life of the all. [Concern for] the universal good begins to take hold of his heart.
[But] as a result of this spiritual leap—as he leaps from a limited sphere with a narrow love for himself to the broad love of the all—he is liable to lose acquisitions that are apparently small but in truth are very laudable.
The structures of a good life that are well-rooted in [a person’s] ways in the structures of [his] faith align themselves completely with the exalted stature of the goal of loving the all.
But it is not easy to recognize all of the precise details [of proper behavior] within universal spiritual exaltedness.
Nevertheless, however hard this work is at first, it is necessary, because if a person will lose [sight of the] impressions [made by such] behavior because they are so fine, he will obscure the strongest characteristic, in [his] life of deed, that constitutes the basis for the most elevated life of the spirit.
And because [this person then], with a lawlessness of deed, blemishes uplifted ideals, which are the final goals of the deed of the Torah and [its] commandments—although he does not sense the relationship between [his] subtle thoughts in their elevated might and these deeds—[his] soul is blemished, [and his] ideals in their inherent being are distanced from [his] inner personal awareness—that is to say, from the quality of life of [his] personage, which has already broken the practical basis of his life. And with that, [his] wings are clipped and [his] soulful flight to supernal greatness and elevation is weakened.
He may consider, think, visualize, and imagine that he still soars in the noble worlds, that he yearns for elevated ideals. But [his] inner strength is removed and dulled as a result of [this] practical dulling.
And [this person’s] practical framework—which was [initially] so certain when it was protected, when [his] entire soul was linked to the lodestar of reward and punishment, without [any] ideal elevation and desire of universal awareness at all—weakens, after [having] risen to the world of spiritual nobility and intellectual awareness.
Therefore, necessity presses [on him]: that just as [his] spirit rose to live a life of awareness in [the spirit’s] entirety—to yearn for a spiritual life—so will [his spirit] delve [even] more [fully and] seek spiritually, until it will reach such a state that the overall source of the ideal yearning will reveal all of its hidden treasures to it. [Then his] inner link to the most particular details of the ways of practical life—[as it] had stood upon [a strong] foundation during [his] days of smallness—will remain in its place, and [with] even more beauty and lovely holiness during [these] days of greatness, at the time of the first-born manifestation of the supernal noble thought, [when] the principal factor in the impetus of [this person’s] ethical life will no longer be the truth of reward and punishment but rather an ideal yearning for a life that possesses knowledge and ethical character in its full meaning.

Paragraph 139

It is a good sign for a person and for the nation when their ethical sense develops. [When this] sense is well-developed, it recognizes every ethical flaw [affecting] it, and is repulsed by it.
Sometimes [this] ethical awareness greatly precedes [a person’s] ability to freely [actualize his will]. Then the addition of this knowledge greatly increases [his] pain, because [he] sees clearly how his ethical ruptures afflict his soul, and he proceeds drearily, oppressed by his will, distressed by the fear of [its] blows (Tehillim 39:11), [which come due to] the fact that [his] ethical ability has not yet developed to [match his present] level of awareness.
But these sufferings are the sufferings of love. In the end, they [will] bring complete light.
As [this person’s] awareness begins to perform its work [in the realm of his] knowledge, it is followed by [his] ability to perform its work [in the realm of his] will. [That is] because ultimately a [person’s] will—and in certain respects as well, [his] ability [to rule over] himself—is the completion of the clarification of [his] awareness. His soul [was] oppressed and his ability weak only because of the dimness of [his] awareness.
[A person’s] entire external, objective environment also helps actualize the ability hidden in [his] awareness. [That is] because the movement to elevate existence is not enclosed in any isolated, particular factor. This movement spreads out across the entire realm related to itself.
[Those] matters that mobilize [a person’s] spirit and [self]-improvement are directed in accordance with the extent of [his] ethical awareness and the extent of its distance from [his] ethical will and ability, until [those mobilizing matters] unite [his] ability [and] will with [his] awareness, refining the tendency of [his] spirit relating to [his will and ability] and elevating it to the high peak that [his] awareness has already reached.
These are the pangs of the righteous, which purify the individual and the nation, and prepare him and it to be “righteous, pious, upright, and faithful” (Pirkei Avot 6:1).

Paragraph 140

The [rabbinic] intelligentsia thinks that it can separate itself from the [pious] masses—then it will then be healthier in its spirit, nobler in its thought.
That is a fundamental error: an error that does not recognize the healthy aspect of natural states of awareness, natural feelings, and the natural senses—which, although they have not been rectified, have not been tainted by any [negative] cultural influence.
The healthy aspect of uprightness is found much more in coarse people than it is found in learned and ethical thinkers.
The learned are more outstanding regarding the details of ethics, its rules and specifics. But the essence of feeling is found in people who are naturally healthy: the masses, the common people.
And it is not only in the feeling of basic ethics that the masses are superior to the elite. So too in regard to the feeling faith, Divine greatness, beauty, the senses—[they process] everything in life in an upright way, not filtered by conduits filled with “the liquor of the pools of the spirit” (cf. Isaiah 19:10) of knowledge and wisdom. [All of] this is healthier and purer in the masses.
Granted, by themselves the masses cannot maintain their might and purity. They cannot link their concepts together, and they do not know how to stand firm in the thick of battle when states of awareness and feelings oppose and contradict each other, warring within them—whether [triggered] from within or from the world without.
For that, they need the help of those great in counsel, who straighten the paths of the world of the masses before them.
But just as [the elite] pour advice and counsel onto [the masses], so too do [the masses] pour a healthy life onto [the elite].
And the shared intersection of the noble of spirit and the masses is the power that maintains both of them upon their estimable stance, and guards them from all rot and decay, [whether] ethical or physical.
Prophecy, which comes from the Divine conduit, comes specifically to that end: to unify the popular spirit with the noble spirit that is unique to the elite few.
The masses’ expressions are linked in [prophecy] with the ideal thought of those wealthy in spirit.

Paragraph 141

[In addition to what occurs in the human domain,] there is also a special spiritual intensification in all existence in the particulars of the inanimate, plant, and animal [domains].
Without a doubt, wherever a constricted shift of inner radiance has changed [that location’s] spiritual state relatively little, [that change]—although it is a small, undeveloped, and rudimentary kernel—is sturdy, mighty and tough. And from its might it will influence the developed avenues that are higher than it is: every [higher avenue as it] relates to a low avenue.
[Thus,] we cannot imagine the levels of intensity of the life and spiritual health that mute animals pour onto us due to the fact that we are partners in life with [those animals].
Regarding the mutual influence of the members of a nation’s society, that is evident to almost all of us. And for those [few] with a clearer outlook, [the mutual influence of all members of] humanity in general [is evident]. But as for [our] soul’s partnership with the totality of the animal [domain], that is still hidden. No scholar of the spirit dares yet express his confidence that this knowledge will become clear.
However, distant suggestions come like dreams to the precise sciences, giving tidings of their appearance.
We can already rise to the height of unification with the animal [domain] in general, and from there [to unification] with plant and inanimate existence: with the core of life, the spark of light, that lives within them. They affect us and we [affect] them.
All that we say about ethics and goodness, vision and song is only [our] expounding about sparks—which, in their hidden source, in the details of mute existence, are more vital, more alive with inner strength [than what we can say about them]. But [there] they are constricted and thirsting for breadth.
We unite with the common folk among us, with the broad masses, sensing that most ideals must be moistened with the dew of life of the general betterment of the broad masses: the radiance of life in [this general betterment] together with the entire populace, when “the blind and lame among them, the woman with child and she who travails with child will all be together” (Jeremiah 31:7). But more than that, “[we] will have a treaty with the stones of the field, and the animals of the field will make peace with us” (Job 5:23).

Paragraph 142

Every ideal thought that affects [a person’s] life is composed of a blend of intellect and emotion.
The intellect is small in its quantity [but] great in its quality. It is the foundation of the soul of the ideal [thought], which is continuously drawn forth, weaving the thread of life.
The emotion is the body [of the ideal thought]. [That] intellectual ideal always clothes itself in [emotion], [so that the emotion] may transmit [intellect] to the active, [behavioral] power of life.
[After] many days [pass, that] emotion will lose its value. It will grow old and aged, and will no longer provide its strength.
But as long as the intellectual core within it is mighty and pure, [that core] will not grow weak and it will not age.
Truth exists forever. From its root, it will send forth streams that will bring the moisture of the dew of life, that will vitalize new branches and fresh trees, which will grow in the form of new emotion filled with strength of hidden things, [and] which will replace the emotion that had fallen, due to [its] age.
Thus proceed the changes of life and death in the world of emotion.
[As for] the absolute life of pure intellect, [it] is always giving life and engendering a new generation [of emotion], after the expiration of the old.
Incidents of mourning, lowering one’s hands in immobility and grief: all [of that] exists in the framework of emotion. When emotion ages, when it ceases to have active power, all dispositions that were supported by it and were filled with the light of life because of it will fall with it. The active camp will remain silent and stunned. It will not be able to rise so very quickly to [view] the vision of the survival of the spirit, to know that the intellectual core, which gave life to the emotional ideal, [still] lives and exists, just as the consolations [of knowing] that the spirit survives and the dead [will be] revived do not heal the wound of death that has wounded the heart of people who cling to [their] relatives’ [departed] flesh and spirit.
But in the end, a new spirit will quickly arrive, and “it will offer consolations” (cf. Isaiah 57:18). The intellectual spark will emerge from its hiding place. It will [provide] light and joy. It will establish a large host of new emotions, girded with vigor.
[It is true that] the days [of these new emotions] too will be cut off [so that the emotions will be] taken, leaving space for a new host [of emotions]. But the course of life will always proceed on its assured course.

Paragraph 143

The unity of existence grows stronger in [a person’s] ideal awareness the higher that [awareness is].
A spiritual person sees life in all of existence. He sees [its] power enveloped in everything from which he draws life to his spirit, and in everything from which all living things draw life.
[That] life is hidden in the elements that provide nutrition, hidden in the depths of the earth, emerging to sprout and grow in the open. [That life] comes as food, it unites with a person’s flesh and spirit. Within it, a spiritual constitution, a vitality of life, [and] freedom and light are revealed.
Who shall tell us that there is a separation, who will believe the narrow [desensitizing] habituation and illusion that the elevation of the [individual’s] soul is not the elevation of the all? Who will be stupefied, [either] by breadths of space [or] by dividing walls?
The great spirit that dwells in the highest, mighty heavens, in the palace of justice and understanding, gives might and power—it <i>is</i> might and power. It gives life—and it <i>is</i> life and the life of life.
[A person’s] will develops by means of the power of [his] potential. [That] potential reaches its completion in [his] will.
The improvement of [his] will to the side of good sums up within [itself] the entire fullness of life incorporated into the breadth of existence.
[Now his] will scatters goodness onto everything. [His] desire for goodness spreads. [It] shines its light back even higher, onto all of those places from which the might of life had been removed.
And does life cease at the boundary of what we call life? Doesn’t it continuously spread forth? The goodness in [life] has not ceased and will never cease. [The goodness] will not know of any limitation to its elevation and its expansion, to its beauty and its might.
All of the characteristics of uprightness, ethics, holiness, might and beauty are revelations of life across the fullness of existence. They attain their might as instruments via which [a person’s] good will executes its desire.
When [a person’s] good will intensifies as [it] draws down life, it provides kernels of light, which multiply as they bond with [his] external might.

Paragraph 144

The Temple—[which is] the spiritual focus of [our] nation and the source of the spiritual life of its every individual, because [it provides] a tangible vision that stuns the eye with its beauty and that elevates the consciousness with its powerful awesome character—must be built every day in the spirit of every individual of Israel so that his spirit will connect the fullness of its life to the core of [our] nation in [her] perfect state.
[When that will truly happen,] the individual’s personal abilities will be refreshed, with a life of faith and a warmth of emotion (with its light) blossoming within [his personal abilities] like exquisite flowers in a panorama of exceedingly lovely colors.
[We] prepare [ourselves to reach] this goal in actuality when we [recite] the “daily order of the sacrifices” prior to the [morning] prayer: the passage[s] of the washbasin, the daily offering, [and] the incense.
[As they are recited,] these [passages] sow the Divine greatness of the great and holy Temple within the depths of [a person’s] soul, so that he all but reaches the peak that each person [attained] when the nation was alive and her Temple lay in her midst upon her land.
The seeds of [a person’s] yearning for the completion of the nation’s spiritual character continuously bear fruit upon the furrows of [his] heart. [The “plants” that grow] increase continuously, climbing and interlacing with the entire wealth of [his] good thoughts that relate to this central concept.
And [then ultimately] the “congregation of Israel” is built with the spirit of a firm building, [and she dedicates] her might to God. That [building] gives her power [that comes] from the aspect of the eternal splendor stored in the special nature of her desires. [It does so] more than [would] a multitude of secular physical buildings and national institutions that enhance the strength of every nation that lives only upon [the basis of] its flesh and its physical might.
[But even before that,] the immaculate and elevated love of God is aroused and stands firm [and] alive, with great might, in the soul of [our] nation because of her memories of primal days, when the flame of the perfect God was with her.
The ideal [consciousness] of this exalted memory draws from the depths every exquisite idea and every tremendous and holy aspiration, and sets before the eyes of the entire nation her great Divine worth, which fills all of the chambers of the heart of each of her children with splendor and magnificence.

Paragraph 145

Feeling is swifter than intellect. In feeling, the word “God” is filled with fecundity and reality even before the smallest fraction of all the multitude of enigmas concealed with it is deciphered.
But this is not the case with intellect. Intellect requires toil. Without study and inquiry, one will find nothing.
If feeling is exchanged for intellect, if one will desire to engage one’s intellect without spiritual labor, in order to enjoy the benefit of what is already prepared—as it is possible to do in feeling—one’s world will swiftly grow dark. Tangled thorns will flourish in one’s spiritual portion, one will constantly be entangled, and one’s spiritual path will be filled with stumbling blocks.
“There is a time and judgement that the heart of the wise man knows” (Ecclesiastes 8:5). And that is: to enter the palace of feeling in its fullness, to take pleasure in its sweet things, and to allow the portion of the intellect to engage in its toil. Then the knowledge of God will enter one’s heart in its most desirable form.

Paragraph 146

[A person’s] piety in practice is the materialization of [his] closeness to God in the actuality of [his] life.
When [that piety in practice] comes from the aspect of [a person’s] ethics based on logic, it clothes [and expresses] itself in [the sort of] good deeds and kindness whose goodness [his] human intellect understands in keeping with its capacity.
[But] when [a person’s piety in practice] comes from the aspect of the Divine feeling [within him] (which is superior to the measure of [his] logic)—[a Divine feeling] that seeks comfort in a closeness to God that may be visualized, that has a spiritual form—[that piety] clothes [and expresses] itself in deeds of holiness that sometimes astonish the logical outlook.
[This person performs deeds] that those lowly of spirit can imitate, [although] without any spirit of inner life. But in the [deeds’] essential purity in a vigorous soul that yearns for practical closeness to God, just as it thirsts for [closeness] in its visualizing mode, these astonishing ways are ways of life filled with the light of Hashem and His goodness.
They are precious conduits via which [a person] sprinkles the dew of life of the joy of worlds, of an attained wholeness within [his] spirit, [to] raise [his spirit] above all of the limited concepts of what is good and upright in which human beings are caught. And very often, [people’s] feet stumble because of these [limited concepts], because of the pressure of the laws of narrow logic of the human intellect, which is so very limited.

Paragraph 147

The [Kabbalistic] “straight [line]” is the most cardinal element in existence, to which the [Kabbalistic] “circles” are secondary.
That is to say, the freedom of life, the absolute freedom [coming] from the aspect of the source of existence, freedom in the Divine sense, from whose ethical aspect comes the creation of existence: that is everything.
And from that, [we may] derive that [a person’s] ethics in the pathways of [this-worldly] life are the aspect [of existence] that will determine [his] life.
Limited human ethics is not complete, because it itself requires [a higher] ethics so that it may reach its [state of] purity.
But the ethical concept that decides the character [of human ethics] is the most interior form within existence. It is the Shechinah, which leads [a person] to Divine awareness in its mighty soaring. It is the mother who herself descends to the low level of the infant, which needs to be nursed and to have its childish [needs] cared for. And the source of her root is high and elevated, beyond all of the rules of existence, which surround everything with the gigantic might of their necessary [rule] and permanence.
Within the “circles” themselves—within the necessary rules of existence, within the sturdy, iron rules that do not change in their action upon nation and individual, which apply their goodness [even] to all evil people, and whose burning aspect scorches even those who are good and upright—within the inner content [of those circles], only the straight [line] continuously acts. [Matters] proceed in accordance with, and for the sake of, the character of the straight [line].
When [a person’s] complete ethical awareness intensifies, it drives its path beyond all of the interposing rules, and they [themselves] cause the light of ethical freedom within the necessary and supposed darkness to flare.
[Then] great wonders are revealed in keeping with the greatness of the faith and uprightness of [a person’s] heart. [These wonders] transcend all rules of necessity even within the oppressed and limited circle of nature. Moreover, that existence continuously rises, and its principal place expands beyond the narrow limitation of the blind and deaf rules, bringing freedom to the entire framework of inherent life, filled with intellect and will, whose entire space is filled with generosity and uprightness.
Happy is the person who has not abandoned himself to the power of the environment that casts darkness, [but] whose eyes are open “to gaze upon the pleasantness of Hashem” (Psalms 27:4) revealed in beautiful worlds that appear to the eyes of the spirit of those who are pure.

Paragraph 148

Why shouldn’t all of the occurrences of overall existence be similar to the circumstance of the individual man and animal? Why shouldn’t all existence be interpreted in keeping with the part of it that is visible? Why shouldn’t all existence yearn, hope, rise and descend and again rise, with an inner feeling and with complete clarity that it is growing in accordance with its great domain, like a person on his level and an animal on its level?
Why isn’t everything envisioned to us in one complete unit? And why can’t the good portion, wherever it is found, illuminate itself and the entire totality?
Why isn’t the light of Hashem sought everywhere? Why doesn’t joy pierce through all regions of life? Why doesn’t the longing for good overwhelm all might and strength?
The more that these questions are asked with vigor, with strength and keenness, the more do they fulfill their [own] demand and bring about the desired conclusion.

Paragraph 149

[The fact] that the righteous person endures the sin of the generation and attains atonement for it with his sufferings is something that is felt.
Every individual of Israel on his level suffers from the sin of the generation. And the more the character of [his] spirit is refined and cleansed, the more [his] suffering is filled with love.
And the more that [his] suffering, which comes as a result of [his] love for the all, for the nation, depresses [his] heart, [the more his] spirit rises to the supernal height of purity and strives to go on a good and upright way, on a supernal, holy way, as though it is required to complete what is lacking in the generation.
And with that, in truth, the pure spirit of the righteous person completes the general deficiency.
And impressions of the good, which grow more intense because of the individual whose heart is touched by the spiritual suffering of the many, affect everyone. [That goodness] acts in a revealed manner to [adorn] the holiness [with] a necklace of grace and kindness and, more than all of that, it acts in hidden ways, in the special nature of the spirit, concealed from the eye of every onlooker.

Paragraph 150

How elevated it is, how much truth and hidden song it constitutes: the mystical idea that a person, with his spiritual ability, affects all existence.
The spatial [dimension] cannot contain the light of life within [a person’s] free will, which can rise, when [he] chooses good with mighty strength and elevated wisdom, to a very high realm.
How wonderful is the ethical outlook that emerges from such a great, responsible construct. A person [feels] responsible for all existence, for all worlds. They are in his power. He may increase their grace and light of life, joy and honor, when he goes in an upright way [and] when he strengthens himself and girds himself with pure might to become master of good, esteemed ways of life, [and he] rises from strength to strength.
[Conversely,] he has the power to cause pain “to every good portion” (cf. Kings II 3:25) when he lowers his spirit, corrupts his ways, and darkens his spiritual light as [a result of] terminating his ethical purity.
This elevated ethical pinnacle—built in keeping with a [person’s] global [ethical] reckoning (cf. Bava Batra 78b)—is great and magnificent. When it appears, it refines [a person’s] spirit until it can no longer be brought low. [His spirit then] rises upon the walls and towers of all existence, of all reality, of all eternity and the splendor of all worlds, [and these walls and towers] protect it from all evil.
How can the character of evil rise to participate in the life of a person and his deed[s], when such an elevated and uplifted reckoning lies before him?
It is true that [a person’s] prior ethical corruption can blur [his] eye until it cannot at all gather strength to see the clear light of this universal [ethical] reckoning. [His] ear might be uncircumcised due to the dulling [caused by his] sins until it no longer heeds the voice of God calling powerfully from this elevated ethical [concept] spread forth [before him], which embraces the fulness of infinite worlds.
But at least a good thought to return [and] be sanctified, to be purified from all sin, will rise in a person’s heart. [His] eye [will] open and [his] ear will be unobstructed after [having been] uncircumcised, and the voice of God will call to him powerfully from the entire fullness of worlds, [calling him] to rise above the dwelling places of darkness and to be uplifted with that great spiritual elevation that is fitting [and] in keeping with the greatness of his responsibility for all existence.

Paragraph 151

At times, the flight of a person’s thought—which is higher than any limited logic and, how much more, than any fixed, practical halachah—intensifies. Then his heart yearns upwards, and he can by no means constrict his spirit in limited learning.
At that point, he [should] free [his] spirit. He should soar in keeping with his penchant. He should seek God in the way that his soul, hovering upon the currents of the many waters, guides him.
And if he also turns [his] attention at that time to some practical learning, he cannot delve into it, because his spirit is soaring in the distances. At any rate, if his spirit lifts him, he can learn in a superficial way, because [he possesses a] swiftness of thought that lifts him upon its wing. He swallows information that he comes across, and [all of this information] coalesces.
The spirit [of such a person] cannot sum up [everything] for him in a structure and [set] tempo. [He] cannot be burdened with measured exactitude. [Matters must be] in accordance with the degree to which he finds a comfortable possibility of compromising with practical existence and a state of [this-worldly] life that demands [to play] its role and that cannot compromise itself entirely even for the sake of the highest claims of supernal spirituality.

Paragraph 152

It is [part of the nature of] the general radiance of the way of supernal spirituality that it is so high and supernal that it does not have any limited ideas and clear thoughts, individual letters and organized factors. But it has greatness and inner beauty. Because of it, all practical thoughts are enveloped in splendor and magnificence, and they are filled with power and might.
And the more detailed and specific [these thoughts] are, the more they become good receptacles to hold the good light of the supernal holiness that is hidden from all eyes.

Paragraph 153

It is true that in previous days philosophers were more involved [than scholars are today] with the sacred and the spiritual, and the [material] sciences then stood at a low level. Conversely, in [more] recent days, when scholars have turned [to] the practical sciences, they have continuously succeeded in making many new discoveries.
But this does not at all mean that we must grow indifferent to engaging in [the study of] spiritual and sacred matters. Rather, [we learn] that it is incorrect to approach information that is dependent on the senses and on a connection to the world of action via abstract contemplation and spiritual comprehensions.
Therefore, all of those people whose portion in wisdom is sensory must distance themselves in [their sensory] study from all spiritual comprehensions, and focus on scientific exploration.
But [in regard to] the essence of spirituality in its core, [reaching] to Divinity and to the spiritual aspect of the human being—[including] ethics, justice, and all of the spiritual qualities [contained] within them—[a person] can succeed specifically when he immerses [himself] in spirituality.
Even after all of the success of the most recent scientists, these [spiritual] matters retain their stature. And whoever finds himself prepared [to understand] them must focus solely on these [spiritual] studies in order to bring light and life into the world.

Paragraph 154

The spiritual visions that must, in their mighty purity, be revealed in our spirit, are drawn from the primary sources of the early generations.
[We draw those spiritual visions] specifically from the times that life was simple and healthy, [when] the spiritual content [in life] shone in the souls of the special few with a fullness and elevated purity.
In the days of the “Enlightenment”—in particular, practical and societal—the spiritual strength of the human being was spread outward, toward technical works and external aspects of life. And with that, the strength to gather the inner aspect of life, regarding which we must be aided by means of the great inheritance that remains for us from the earliest days—the Torah of Hashem in its entire breadth—was tremendously weakened.

Paragraph 155

All beliefs [fit into one of] two frameworks (as the Rambam has discussed [in] Guide to the Perplexed III 28): true beliefs and necessary beliefs.
True beliefs are the foundation that maintains the totality of faith, [whereas] necessary [beliefs] are like a peel that protects the fruit. [The latter are] in keeping with the level of every nation and every group united under the banner of some faith. The more elevated, eternal, and true the fundamental faith is, the more refined, strong, clear, and enlightened will the [necessary beliefs] attached to it be, in keeping with the purest requirements of ethics and in the light of the clearest knowledge.
Occasionally a time comes when a power is revealed necessary to remove some [part] of the necessary beliefs from the domain of faith, because a group [of people] has reached the stage where it need no longer be supported by the aspect of that necessary [belief within its] form of faith.
Then a sort of ferment begins. On the one hand, this [shedding of a necessary belief] appears to be a breach in the foundation of faith. [But] on the other hand, [it appears] as an illumination and bright radiance upon the horizon of faith, and [as something that] adds strength to the foundation [of faith].
And in truth both aspects are true.
Not all people and not all communities will mature at the same time and in the same era. It will happen that one part [of a society] has reached a level in the development of its awareness and culture where it no longer needs some aspect of a necessary belief. Consequently, that [belief] is superfluous for it. [That belief] hinders the progress of its spirit, the holiness of its soul, and its [soul’s] upward flight.
But in a group [of that society] that has not yet reached this point and [in which] the necessary [belief] is completely [required], the removal of this necessary [belief] constitutes the chopping down of saplings and the destruction of faith.

Paragraph 156

Descending from the stage of history is possible only for a nation that has completed what it began, and for a spiritual vision that has brought everything hidden with[in] it into the light of the world.
To begin [something] and not complete [it]—that is absolutely not the way of existence.
The inner feeling, which is powerful within us [and makes it possible for us] to establish the existence of Judaism with its perspectives and deeds together with its body and its land, comes from the public’s overall awareness that we still have a long way [to go before we will] finish what we have begun.
Among ourselves and in the ears of the entire world we have begun to tell something that is great—[but] we have not yet finished it. We are in the middle of our speech, [and] we do not desire, nor are we able, to interrupt [it].
We will by no means abandon the ways of our national life nor our abstract aspirations—these [two] being connected with each other—that rise above every particular coterie, just as we will not abandon our hope to be rebuilt and to be a nation upon our historical land as [we were] in early days.
We cannot abandon any of these.
The ideals that enliven all [existence]—it is not so easy to recognize how they have a place in life, but it is they that enliven all life. When they leave, the soul of life leaves.
Nor will we be confounded because we falter so much in our self-expression when we speak about our aspiration. We know that the imperfection is not in the clarity of the idea and in its truth. The truth within us is very strong, but it is so rich, and [such] a wealth of ideas flows onto us, that we are not yet fit to explain it with a clear tongue.
Despite that, we will not turn back. To the extent that our power of speech will allow us, we will speak and we will explain. Within ourselves, we understand our thought.
[And] with the passage of time, our speech too will emerge from the heavy exile in which it has been quelled, and we will be able to speak, to describe and to explain, [using] clear expressions, what we seek with our entire existence.
Until that golden age, we will not refrain from our work, practical and spiritual.

Paragraph 157

A happy life—whether that of an individual or that of the public—comes into being to the extent that [this life] implements in actuality the practical steps that the most exalted ideals require of it. Every practical ascent in the precise details of [a person’s or the public’s] movements, in accordance with the evoking of the most exalted and expansive thought—thought that transcends all of the spheres of human constriction—leads to the crystallization of [these] exalted ideals and to [our] turning to their development and elevation. Every such elevation elicits hidden blessing in the depths of life. It generates a great spiritual force, and it fortifies the power and victory of these ideals in the inner world of the individual and in the external world of the populace.
Conversely—although every withdrawal, every self-concealment and negligence regarding the practical organization that the most exalted ideals in their totality demand cannot sever the ideal sequence (it still proceeds victoriously upon its route, [making use] of the many powers that it finds before itself)—[that withdrawal] nevertheless darkens the world of the person who has retreated.
And as this practical withdrawal increases, necessarily the ideal radiance is darkened and its light dims, until [at last,] out of some sort of imprisonment, a mighty power [that was] hidden in the depths breaks through, protesting with all its might against the trampling of the ideal, and demanding recompense for the spiritual insult [that it has experienced] from a world that is growing impoverished and remiss.
This robust power repairs the breaches, raises those who stumbled and encourages the weak, until the ideal Shechinah returns to dwell with honor in the souls of human beings who are capable of absorbing into themselves the treasury of true life in all of its power and richness.

Paragraph 158

The more [a person’s] awareness of the ideal rises, the more its branches proliferate. [Conversely,] the more [that this awareness] is constricted and darkened, the more [those] branches are constricted and unable to spread out.
We find expansion of the branches of the ideal in the supernal heights, in the Divine ideal [that exists at the heart of] the configuration of existence. Life in its purity, in its height, in its spirituality, in its ethics and its enlightenment, stands at the summit of the ideal. Because of the outstanding clarity of the ideal [at the level] of supernal knowledge, [at the level of] wisdom [about] Creation, [its] branches are many and they propagate copiously.
The needs of [this-worldly] life are many and varied. All of their configurations are extensive, and they occupy an extensive place in existence, [so that] not even the most obscure need is lacking. All of this is because of the power of [a person’s] faculty of awareness [when it] comes to the character of [his] desire and [his] ability to actualize the exalted ideal of life.
The Torah of Israel is outstanding in crystallizing the idealism that spreads across all of the configurations of life.
Because the structures [of life implement] the strategies of [that] idealism, they too spread out. They bear branch and fruit. [Then] everything is moistened by the life-giving dew that [comes from] the root of idealism, which vanquishes everything that stands against it and everything that wishes to reduce its ability to spread itself forth.
Sometimes, the ideal appears as a spark that is small in quantity. However, its quality is high, endlessly extensive, and deeper than the depths of the abyss. From this, we learn that ideals must be worked on, [both] in themselves and in their relationship with their many branches. The ideals [may] appear constricted as one small point, because sometimes one small and ordinary sentence contains an abundance of very many ideals, and we must clarify the wealth hidden in it. Moreover, the relationship between the essence of the ideals and their practical branches must be worked on [as well].

Paragraph 159

To the degree that a person’s awareness of the ideal and [his] spiritual strength increase, so does the relationship between the practical consequences [of his behavior] and [his] abstruse ideas grow more tightly bound. [Then] strands that could not at all have bound one to the other when the ideal spirit (as it comes from its root) was lacking, suffice to make a tight and living connection—with supernal exactitude—between [this person’s] many deeds and the ideal, original spirit. [Now the] flawlessness in [the realm of the] practical [aspect of his life], girded with might and awesome splendor, prevails over the pathways of [his] life.
Whenever there is a breach in the practical [part of a person’s life], that is essentially brought about because the light of universal idealism [in him] has dimmed. The less light there is, the less inner power of life there is to perform its function.
[Then] the strong bond between [a person’s] spirit and [his] deeds weakens until [that bond] disturbs [him], and [he feels] repulsion at deeds that result from the elevated idealism. This is precisely due to [his] very propensity for idealism. This explains the common sight that we meet with in those people who rise to the heights of ethical spirit in [their] thought, those people who storm [the heights] to destroy every practical, precise, and lawful bulwark. In truth, the spiritual elevation [that these people attain] is not a healthy and original, idealistic propensity. Rather, it is a dimming of the light that lives in the sources of the soul, in accordance with its nature and its inner descent. [That dimming] increases [such people’s] external manner [of self-expression] with a wealth of pompous words and ideas filled with passion and sick emotionalism, which expands the quantity of ideal [ideation] at the expense of [that ideal’s] fundamental quality.
The cure for this weakness is none other than [for a person] to increase [his] ideal awareness in its essential purity by going deeply and extensively into the most elevated original spirit. Then the spirit of the might and the active power [of the ideal] is revealed. [And this power] overcomes [his] practical weakness and restores the entire mighty splendor to the ideals.

Paragraph 160

Postulates necessary [for people to believe, in order to sustain them on a path of truth] are offshoots that emerge from fountainhead ideals [and that come] to a corporealized ideal in [this-worldly] life. [These necessary postulates] are derived directly from postulates that are absolute truths.
The foundation of necessary postulates and their placement [in a person] is in [his] visionary ability, [in his] esthetic sense.
[These necessary postulates] are [then] clothed in [his] speech [and] in [his] rhetoric, and [are] materialized in [his] deed, which encloses in [that] circle of deed the absolute truth of the spiritual realm.
The source of [the necessary] postulate is in the true postulate: in its absolute truth, in its concentrated goodness and elevation within the source of life and existence, [both] universal and individual.
When the inner, fundamental, [higher] postulate intensifies, it emanates [part] of its splendor and might onto the necessary postulate. With [the power of the former’s] emanation, the latter stands in its place. [Then this necessary postulate] provides a good basis for practical life and sweetens it. It provides the brilliance suitable for life, [and] it refines and perfects [life].
And [that necessary postulate] will never need to clothe itself in garments that are not its own and to describe itself as having a character that does not apply to it—i.e., the character of the supernal postulate, the postulate of truth.
The postulate of truth raises [the necessary postulate to be] the practical base of the honor of [the postulate of truth].
And the more that [the postulate of truth] is prominent and appreciated, the more is the basic, [necessary] postulate confirmed in its place, in its effect on [a person’s] life and in [his life’s] honor, in [his] power to visualize and imagine the whole, as well as [each] particular, until he is alerted to and hates—with an inner awareness more ethical than anything on the truest and straightest [this-worldly] human avenue—any actions that could blemish, however slightly, the splendid holiness of the lower postulate. And thus the low postulate expands. And the more it expands in its realm, the more expansive a receptacle it becomes to receive the totality of the splendor and light of the true postulate, of the “true faith” (Isaiah 25:1).

Paragraph 161

We must disclose what we sense of the good effects that [performing] the mitzvot has upon us, of how [the mitzvot] build our world: [our] individual world and our public, national world.
[Wearing] tefillin perfects our [spiritual] form.
[Tefillin] have the special quality of engraving upon the person who wears them the essence of those matters that are stated on [the biblical passages that are written on the parchments within them].
Those letters have the effect of being engraved upon the person. The inner spiritual essence that is the purpose of these passages builds the soul of the Jew every day. [That essence] builds a Jew’s unique ability of visualization, which contributes a distinctive quality to the entire composition of [his] life, to [his] entire life of spirit and morality, to [his] entire Jewish identity.
And it has been precisely by means of the addition of this spiritual sustenance, which has every day gone forth and sweetened the soul of every Jew, the Hebrew spirit awoke and was constantly alert and alive, prepared [to express its] particular nature.
This is a great principle in the education of the nation of Israel, of the engraving [made upon] her spirit in keeping with her unique situation.
Foods [that a Jew eats] are [the nation’s] foods. They are apt for her inner spirit. [On the other hand,] those [foods] forbidden to her obscure [her] spirit.
We do not need to locate this obscuring in the quality of universal morality. The universal morality of the human being proceeds on other paths. It is not so much concerned with purifying a person at the beginning of his [path of developing his] propensities.
[Rather,] this is something unique to Israel.
Forbidden foods dull the heart. They destroy the impression of the image of the life unique to Israel. They obscure the Israelite holiness, so that an individual’s abilities cannot connect to [his] Israelite character.
Those people [who eat forbidden foods] become like limbs [of the nation] into which the character of the inner life of the nation, in the depth of its feelings, does not enter. Their soul is blemished.
The soul of the Israelite individual is only that which is taken from the totality of the nation. That is the special quality of “one nation upon the earth” (Samuel II 7:23).
Oh, who will uncover the face of the facade? Then people will see and recognize how much we must honor [the Torah’s] every rule and law.

Paragraph 162

Out of unencumbered morality, [out of] human morality, let us acquire foundations with which to establish faith, the faith of Israel, which we and the entire world require so greatly.
Let us elucidate our inner visions, the depth of our tranquility in clinging to Hashem, specifically when we visualize, proclaim, and focus on the name of Hashem, the God of Israel.
Let us elucidate how much this intent quiets our spirit, how much it soothes our soul and prepares us for a pure life that possesses strength and might as well as holiness and purity.
[Israelite] morality is not focused solely on good deeds, [deeds] that are good only in their societal sense. [Our] morality is, first of all, an inner, refined quality that dwells in the soul to seek the good, the absolute good: so that [we will] be good in ourselves, so that [we will] cling to the good.
This holy spirit is found in us only in the context of [our] clinging to the Divine, [and] that comes to us as an outcome of [our] Israelite faith, [expressed both] practically and in [our] contemplations.
We have a spiritual, inner, moral requirement to be absorbed into the nation, our nation: the nation from which overall, across all of its generations, we possess the entire treasury of life, which is truly life, which we feel deep within our spirit. We feel, when we stand in this pure state, [that] we love the name of Hashem, the light of Hashem that dwells within us, that rests within the entire nation. We love the Torah, the mitzvot, the ordinances of Hashem and His laws for Israel.
[Our] knowledge broadens in our depths. It is saturated with the dew of elevated visions and of blissful feelings.
We have love. We have that which to love, that which to honor, that which to hope for, [and] the way in which to fill the content of [our] lives.
We are filled with the all, filled with a phenomenon [of wisdom (cf. Rashi on Shabbat 56a)], a phenomenon with which we have an intrinsic, inner connection, [one that is] powerful and eternal.
[Initially,] we are summoned from within ourselves, from our essence, to constrict our gaze to our inner being. Afterwards, we can broaden [our] thought, we can spread [our] thought across the expanse of the all.
But first we must connect to our true life, to [our] life within, to the inner being of the soul of our soul—with tranquility of the spirit, with pleasantness, with lovingkindness, with might, with love and freshness of life.

Paragraph 163

Listen to me, my people.
From the depth of my soul I speak with you, from the depth of the soul of my soul, from the depth of the bond of life [in which] I am bound to all of you and all of you are bound to me, from the depths of that feeling that I experience as being deeper than all my feelings of life: that you, only you, only all of you, your entirety, all of your souls, all of your generations, only you are the content of my life.
In you I live, in you: in the bloc that comprises all of you, my life has that characteristic that is called life.
Without you, I have nothing. All hopes, all ideals, all the value of the worth of life, all of it I find within myself only with you.
I must bond with all of your souls. I must love you with an infinite love. It is impossible for me to feel any other feeling. All types of love, small and great, in all areas of my life, are all encompassed in my love for you, in [my] love of the totality of you—the totality in which all of your individuals exist and live.
Every one of you, every individual soul from the totality of all of you, is a great and significant spark from the torch of eternal life, which illumines the light of life for me.
You, you give me meaning to [my] life, to [my] devotion, to Torah, to prayer, to song, to hope.
Through the conduit of your being, I feel everything, I love everything. Upon the wings of the spirit of my affection for you, I am lifted up to the love of God, and [that love of God] grows more transparent to me, more clear to me, it takes flame in my heart, it grows purified in my thoughts.
With you, my nation, my people, my mother, the source of my life, with you I soar to the eternal expanses. With your eternity I live an eternal life, with your splendor I am filled with glory and splendor, with your impoverishment I am filled with pains, with the suffering in your souls I am filled with bitterness, with the knowledge and understanding within you I am filled with knowledge and understanding.
The treasure house of life for me is every rhythm [and] every criterion [created by] the stance of your feet.
Your land, the land of your hope, is holy to me. Its skies are a source of grace to me, the source of the beauty of all worlds. Its fertile field and its coastland are the source of hope, the source of blessing, the source of the joy of life. To me, [even] its thorns and briars are clothed in glory and eternal grandeur.

Paragraph 164

I am filled with love for God. I know that what I seek, what I love, is called by no name. How can that which is greater than everything, greater than goodness, greater than [any] attribute, greater than being, be called by any name?
And I love, and I say: I love God.
The light of the Infinite One dwells in the expression of the Name, in the expression of “God,” and in all of the names and appellations that the heart of a man teaches and expresses when his soul is lifted ever upwards.
I cannot satisfy my soul with the love that comes from chains of logic, from the search for the light of God via the world, via an existence that penetrates into the eyes.
In our soul are born Divine lights—from the perspective of our spirit, [they are] many forces.
There is one true God. And higher than “one,” in the depth of His truth, God is revealed. He rules over us, He conquers all of our spirits, the spirit of all existence.
Wherever there is idea, feeling, thought and will, wherever there is noble, spiritual life, the Divine light rules, governs, conquers, scintillates, is magnificent, gives forth splendor and beauty, vivifies, elevates—all out of the clarity of the light of being.
It rules—and it dies.
That rule is limited as long as it comes from the world, from being.
At times the light waxes. [God’s] will desires a light that is especially refined, especially inward, especially true in itself, more energetic in its very core.
The light overwhelms the vessel, thought overwhelms being. The structure cannot hold, the inner content is not congruent, the vessels shatter, the kings die, the gods die, their soul rises, soars to the heavens. The bodies descend to the world of separation, existence stands bare, isolated, torn away, scattered.
It contains within itself, hidden and concealed, an eternal desire for the supernal light.
The eternal love has placed its light, its sparks, within the shattered vessels.
In every movement, in every content of life, in every quality is being. There is a spark, a spark of a spark, faint, exceedingly faint, the inner light, the light of the supernal God, building and setting a foundation, gathering the scattered, rectifying forever, organizing and joining together.
The eternal sovereignty is revealed from the light of the Infinite One that is within the soul. From God to the world, a new light is born: the light of the radiance of the glory of the face of God.

Paragraph 165

Overall, faith is the song of life, the song of existence, the song of being.
And this song is the most penetrating, innermost realization in the depths of the quality of what we [can] realize deep within ourselves, something that is completely impossible for a realization [gained by] prose.
Therefore, the true lens [that shows] life is specifically within the song of life, not within mundane life that is expressed by means of prose.
Woe to the person who wants to deprive life of the splendor of its song. He destroys the entire inner being of life and all of the truth within it.
All of prose [only] attains [its] value because it rests upon the song of life.

Paragraph 166

When a person eats, drinks, [or] performs any [other] necessary physical [act, or when] he is moved by some feeling that has a [measure of] personal delight, [then] his potentialities are awakened—not only in accordance with a measure of intellect, justice, and integrity, but in accordance with the extent to which simple nature, even that which has been impaired as a result of the inappropriate deeds [performed] by him or by humanity as a whole, draws these [acts or feelings] forth.
This applies to an individual and to the world.
[A person’s] clear perception sees that the human spirit is a part of overall existence, just as [a person’s] superficial glance sees that his body and its abilities [are a part of overall existence].
From the aspect of its spirit, humanity is great in the world of the spirit—and so humanity occupies a paramount place [in existence]. The elevation or descent of [humanity’s] spirit, [that spirit’s] perfection or impairment, is the most important object [of study] of the most outstanding thinkers and profound sages.
When a person strengthens his spirit toward the side of good—that is to say, toward the side of [his] character that lays the groundwork for the perfection of existence, [in] its totality and [in] its details, [in] its spirit and [in] its physicality—then, in crucial aspects, [his spirit] enhances the good in the entirety of existence.
This is played out fully, whether immediately or after [some passage of time]. [Then] the [resulting] trait [of goodness] comes into being—whether that is a temporary [state of] being or a [state of] being [so profound that its] form in terms of time is exceedingly different from the [anything within the] character of time to which we are accustomed.
The gaze of [a person with] a pure spirit, [a spirit] that rises above the low ceiling of the senses and their objects, communicates within the parameters of the character of a human being’s spirit and personality, [and it increases] until [it speaks through] all being. It considers the powers in existence in accordance with their level in [the human] microcosmos, which is in truth the macrocosmos. It finds the characteristics of life [in an individual] with all of its concealments and with all of its causations, arranged in such a way that [when it sees] these it can peer upon all being, upon all worlds, upon endless worlds.
And when this gaze is permanent, when [a person’s] ways of life are fitting for [for him to experience] it, it opens wondrous gates: truly the gates of heaven, in the fullness of the meaning [of that phrase].
Fortunate is the person who constantly knocks upon [these gates]. He will be elevated with them and by them from all the lowliness of life. He will be elevated and rise above all deeds. And the entire world [will be] worthwhile for his sake.

Paragraph 167

[Our] minds are stunned by foreign thoughts pouring through the world—foreign thoughts of absolute heresy or foreign thoughts that incline to foreign faiths: Christianity, Islam, Buddhism—[or] any sort of foreign way of service.
They all burst in a torrent into [our] camp. They capture many hearts and distort the paths.
Those people who protect [correct] perspectives, particularly of Judaism, cry aloud [and in so doing] nullify evil perspectives, revealing their sham and falsehood. [But] it is very doubtful whether [their] desire to drive back what has begun to burst through like a volcano will succeed.
We need a greater penetrating look at such a circumstance: a comprehensive, encompassing look, [which is] also precise and which penetrates to the innermost core of the entire multitude of perspectives and constituents of the ideas of faith in the world. A spark of light exists in everything.
A person’s prevailing inclination aspires toward the good, toward the truth, toward spiritual satisfaction in its deepest sense.
It is true that human wickedness and barbarity have warped the paths.
The good spark, the light of Hashem, the light of lights that we cannot articulate, cannot be clothed in letters of any expression, not even of any idea.
It is hidden. It is covered in the depths of the coarsest husks.
The world grows more refined. The upright perspective expands its way. Healthy reasoning and multiple experiences clear the road of obstacles.
Errors diminish, entanglements of the coarse imagination break apart.
In [the world] remains an inner powerful spirit with its might and force, impelling the revelation of the sparks of goodness. And the sparks of goodness, flashes of true light coming from the radiance of light of the true God, begin to appear from the clefts of the lands where darkness spreads.
Therefore, the motes of truth and light scattered among all of the various faiths, which all emerge from the only living well, whose essence and root is always the light of Israel, begin to shine. [That light] is the pure faith that stands upon the sole basis that establishes it forever, [so] that it shall never stumble.
To that end, rather than dismiss the entire content of the weave of thought from which the small sparks of goodness begin to shine—[although they] themselves trap souls to descend deep into the abyss, where darkness still reigns in its mighty power—[because such dismissal] will not succeed, we must increase the initial light to reveal the breadth and depth, the completeness and eternity, existing in the light of Israel, and how each spark, which is good in another world, is [now] revealed, [now] emerges from its source and bonds with [Israel] in a natural bond.
Then, from all of the sparks appearing anew light and life will be added for the soul of the vigorous nation in the might of its spirit, with God’s might in [the nation]. And hearts that thirst for light will gaze at [the nation] and shine. And [the people of Israel] will not go to graze in another’s fields, not even that pasture that they began to think is also [Israel’s] place.

Paragraph 168

When a person looks at himself and sees his physical and spiritual powers, his powers of life and [the powers] of all existence, and he recognizes with an inner recognition the spiritual elevation, the supernal light, in existence, [and] he probes and distinguishes the powerful goodness of the flow of existence in its Divine source, all of his powers immediately begin to yearn for that illumination, and universal wholeness stamps its seal upon his soul.

Paragraph 169

When the power that spreads throughout the world, that engages in activities of the mind, of the character and deeds, grows remote from its supernal source, it becomes piteous [and] dark, and its activities become defective.
In a person’s spirit too, that is how the matter operates.
[But] when we return the power to [its] source, to [its] noble elevation, [our spirit] grows clear, pure, luminous, and strong.
When the supernal power must generate more activities of a clear [nature], it gathers to itself its powers that had declined. In consequence of this gathering, the original power grows and generates new elements.

Paragraph 170

The mitzvot build the soul: the soul of the individual [and] the soul of the community.
The Divine song soars and hovers upon the face of the mitzvot and suffuses into them.
The great concept of the full essence of faith in God in its exalted form—which gladdens life—accompanies every mitzvah in the particular form unique to it. That unique form is engraved in the soul, congruent to the character of the mitzvah and congruent to the extent of soul’s clinging to the supernal light within the mitzvah. And so the soul grows, and its strength increases.

Paragraph 171

The perceptive eye sees the life that spreads throughout all being—overall, and in its every detail.
It gazes and observes the ascent and descent of all the particulars.
In its awareness, it unites the person’s soul, his knowledge and the aspiration of his will with all existence, [with] the lowest, most constricted, most sleeping powers. And it raises the image [of what it sees, to be] high and elevated.
[The person] grasps everything with which he connects, far or near, within the inner being of his life.
With his eating, with his drinking, and with all his physical activities, he recognizes waves of life flowing from the all to him, wishing to rise through him and with him.
He loves the all. He has compassion, he is filled with glory and mighty beauty. He wants the elevation of the all.
And he clings to his ascent with a constant inner clinging, with a yearning for elevation not accompanied by thought and idea, because [that ascent] is greater than any thought, mightier than any designation. He places all ethics, all justice and goodness as the basis of this endless yearning.

Paragraph 172

Existence is filled with [regions of] light and regions of darkness, with structure and confusion, with rectification and chaos.
A person is a complete microcosm in which all existence is reflected.
A person turns—with his gaze, with the inclination of his mind—to light, to order, to rectification in existence. He is himself illuminated, put in order, and rectified. And with the power that he has, he adds more light, order, and rectification to all existence. [He] acts as a fundamental factor and an essential part of [being]. He does not stand alone, but he affects and is affected by its totality.
[If] he turns to the other side—to darkness, to confusion, to chaos—[then] he himself is filled with darkness, chaos, and confusion. And he increases these injuries to a certain degree throughout all existence.
People have diverse inclinations [affecting] the way that they will tend, to one [side] or the other—but the principal factors are the will and the deed that accompanies it: whatever act it may be that fulfills the will, physical or spiritual, [that comes from] the most hidden places [of the psyche].
Sometimes a person looks at the depths of the regions of darkness in existence, at the peaks of the crags, from which all of the injuries in life, all of the futile vanities and all of the miseries of wickedness, emerge.
The inclination of the human heart finds a major connection as well to the power that spreads through existence, gaining form [and growing] liable to chaos and wickedness.
The inclination of a person’s heart is evil from his youth (cf. Genesis 8:21).
He yearns for the exorbitant: to immerse himself in evil, to engender terrible deeds that will tremendously destroy, debilitate, confound and darken. And a type of pleasure of having an effect, of command and domination, emerges from this.
And wickedness makes itself wings and grows in the heart, in the depths of the soul, and in the depths of existence.
Sorcery and all the pollution of its activity are the fruit of this descent, whose source is the evil in existence, which parallels the inclination of the heart of the evil person.
They relate to each other in various ways. [And] the depth of evil in existence finds in [those ways] its multitude of rules, abilities, routes and the ways [in which it] learns.

Paragraph 173

If a person, at the core of the inclinations of his body and constitution, tends to evil, the [aspect of the] evil animal [nature] in inclines to its own [way of] looking and connecting to the side of darkness and [to] the confusion and chaos in existence.
The desire to destroy, to smash, to pulverize, is truly fierce in his spirit’s constitution. And corresponding to this is the stream of [his] consciousness and the evaluation[s] of [his] mind, the sight[s] of [his] imagination, as well as all of the structures of existence that relate to him—inside him and outside him.
But man was created to engage in serving God. [And] he serves God by perfecting himself, his existence, and all existence that relates to him, near or far. He refines his will when he impresses within himself a supernal, refined imprint of the Divine goodness.
In accordance with [his] refinement of this will, the clear, ordered, and rectified aspect of existence stands firmly before his spirit’s eyes, corresponding to the stance of his inner world, which is being rectified [and] perfected.
All of the power that a person draws into himself from existence around [him] is absorbed into his inner capacity. It correspondingly impresses its power broadly onto the existence around [him], which is constantly engaged in either refining and rectifying or eroding and harming.
Every day, when a person elevates his will via the service of Hashem unique to his inner world—which is the work of prayer—he illuminates his soul inside himself, he refines the power of his being [so that it may] emerge from the shadows of evil and the wasteland to the lights of goodness and civilization.
His thought and his will shy away from all of the clouds of darkness related to the aspect of impairment in existence, and [from] all of [those clouds’] subdivisions.
[Only] after he has prepared his spirit within himself may he take sustenance, annexing a treasury of strength from external existence to his [own] strength.
This strength adds strength to the light, truth, [and] shining form of the human being, the side of holiness, the clear consciousness that may be seen in the nature of existence.
But if, while his spirit is still in the mire, [while] the state of his soul is still constricted in the restraints of [his] body before the inner spirit has shone its lights on him, while [his] blood [still proceeds] in its [course] in keeping with its primitive character, which awakens every day in keeping with the nature of the animal [spirit] in the human being, which is not detached from its place all the days of his life—if, before he prays for his blood, [for his improvement], he adds to himself mechanical power from existence, from the environment, then he connects the might of [his] soul [to] a form of darkness, chaos, a tendency to look [upon the world] destructively, the root of pollution, sorcery, omens and auguries, in which the spirit of the human being continues to sink into its pollution.
Regarding this, the verse cries out, “Do not eat on blood” (Leviticus 19:26), a principle that includes as well, “Do not eat before you pray for your blood” (Berachot 10b). Pray that the animalistic blood will cease its ire, that it will fall silent and be refined, that it will rise beyond its lowly circle, that it will awaken from the slumber of wickedness of its smallness.
“You may not act on the basis of omens or auguries” (Leviticus ibid.).

Paragraph 174

Everything that creates rectifies that which is outside itself—in particular, that which is below itself. From [its] surfeit, from [its] existential satiation, it creates.
The appearance of revealed existence out of the concealed, the physical out of the spiritual, comes from the augmentation [provided by] the light above.
That augmentation is implicated in all of the most supernal heights, in all of the loftiest phenomena.
Robust and elevated is the power of the inclination of the eternal righteousness to establish a multitude of infinite worlds. And there is no end to the blessings on the head of the righteous person, the foundation of the world.

Paragraph 175

The ethical ideal, with all of its practical and imaginal details, is a direct consequence of the intellectual ideal, [which is located] in an elevated concealment.
The thought of spiritual people principally soars above, in the heights of the intellectual ideal. Truth and falsehood: that is its entire content.
The content of the ethical ideal, as one of the ribs of the intellectual ideal, is included in it, and takes up no space by itself at all.
We cannot visualize the intellectual ideal in its lofty height via a minimal intent to constrict [our] gaze to the details of good and evil, and to turn from evil and to do good. [The intellectual ideal] has nothing to do with these details. But when [a person] who is illuminated by [the intellectual ideal] encounters those constituents that possess good and evil, he will certainly do what is good, and he will not do what is evil.
The constriction [whose purpose is] to direct the ideal for the sake of good and evil is a tremendous descent for a person who was capable of living a life of the intellectual ideal in its pure essence.
All types of interference of the finest morality on the human plane, which result from the aspect of some intensification of free, elevated thought, derive their richness from the yearning of the intellectual ideal to rise to its place.
[However,] the intellectual ideal will never negate the value of good and of evil. [It will] not say that good is evil or that evil is good, but it will rise over them [both], and in all it touches, the good will remain good and the evil [will remain] evil. [However,] as long as [evil] is in its evil character and in its boundary, those [people] influenced by a small, [constricted] spark of the radiance from above will come, impelled by the removal of [their] eye from penetrating awareness and by a weakness of [their] will in regard to keeping good and evil in the relationship [of good and evil] to themselves in the ways of life, so that they will exchange and transpose [good and evil], until they say that good is evil and that evil is good.
The earth has slipped from under them, and in the heavens above they will not find a firm [platform].

Paragraph 176

The more that people enrich language, and [the more that] literature grows more capable of revealing everything hidden—all the most hidden thoughts of the spirit and all of the most complex and dimmest images and visions—so does the obligation increase for every person who can remove the masks from the highest states of awareness—via which the form of the human being rises—to do his duty.
Furthermore, the entire development of the talent for speech and literary elucidation will ultimately lead to the prophetic goal of all nations attaining clear speech, when all of them will call out the name of Hashem.
Therefore, we see in the blossoming of literature the light of the messiah shining in the world.
And [this] emerging development of language is revealed in all matters: secular as well as holy, impure as well as pure.

Paragraph 177

The levels of intellect proceed from below upwards.
It is known that all images of the imagination are actually images of the intellect—but they are like seeds that have not yet fully grown.
Indeed, when a person’s intellect strengthens and encompasses the quality of his life, then all of the images—of the imagination on all of its levels and of the entire intellect—will grasp each other like the structure of an organic body all of whose parts are intertwined.
Then, when an idea will start to rise from below upward, its flight will be constricted, because ultimately the impression from the miniscule meagerness [of what is below] will affect it, not allowing it [to attain] might and untrammeled breadth.
But when the idea will proceed on its path from above downward, from its supernal flight to the abysses of the imagination and the emotions that depend on it, the light will be greatly illuminated, influenced by supernal lovingkindness.

Paragraph 178

There is a deficiency in fear from its external aspect, because it softens the heart too much. It deprives a person of the character of his might, and so in that respect he remains like a man without any strength.
And thus, fear—even when it is fear of God, emerging from an essentially pure tradition—prevents the perfection of the world, and the completion of the form of the human being.
When matters come to that, when the trait of fear is filled with so much bitterness that its influence depresses the heart excessively, when [a person’s] spirit is unduly steeped in it, then another spirit is already prepared in humanity: a spirit of lawlessness, which comes to mitigate the poison of the exterior fear.
When these two exterior spirits wrestle, the world is filled with a drunken [stupor], and the dust [of their wrestling] rises up to the Throne of Glory. On the one hand are weakness, jealousy, hypocrisy, and vast wickedness, and on the other are power, competition, lawlessness and an empty spirit, which casts down many victims.
And the masses grow ever weaker, until the sun of righteousness will shine and the supernal Divine consciousness will appear in its might, bringing healing in its wings.

Paragraph 179

The fact that people’s thought about God is set in a form that is stereotyped and familiar [to them] due to [their] childhood habituation and imagination leads to the greatest impediment in each person’s spirit as he attains the state of cognizance. That [impediment] is a spark of the [more general] defect [involved in] making a statue and image, regarding which we must be so extremely careful.
The obligation to be careful grows particularly [important] in an era of the clearest awareness, [in general]. The entire aim of the existence of heresy is solely to remove [these] stereotyped forms from the essential thought of all life and [from] the root of all thoughts.
A person who recognizes the core of heresy from this aspect [of it] squeezes out its honey and restores it to the root of its holiness. And he looks upon the glory of the “terrible ice” (Ezekiel 1:22), the “frost of heaven” (Job 38:29).

Paragraph 180

Precious and holy to us are the garments of [our] images. They are essential for us and for all finite beings—in particular, regarding spiritual contemplations.
But always, whenever we attain a conscious life, we may not move away from the supernal point, because only from that which cannot be grasped does light penetrate that which is grasped, in a passage of emanation from the light of the Infinite One.
And we are summoned to be refined with heavenly refinements in all details of [our] awareness within this great totality, from which [come] the issues of all life (cf. Proverbs 4:23).

Paragraph 181

If you desire, human being, look at the light of God’s Presence in everything. Look at the Eden of spiritual life, at how it blazes into each corner and crevice of life, spiritual and of this world, right before your eyes of flesh and your eyes of soul.
Gaze at the wonders of creation, at their divine life--not like some dim phenomenon that is placed before your eyes from afar. But know the reality in which you live.
Know yourself and your world. Know the thoughts of your heart, and of all who speak and think.
Find the source of life inside you, higher than you, around you. [Find] the beautiful ones alive in this generation in whose midst you are immersed.
The love within you: lift it up to its mighty root, to its beauty of Eden. Send it spreading out to the entire flood of the soul of the Life of worlds, Whose light is reduced only by incapable human expression.
Gaze at the lights, at what they contain. Do not let the Names, phrases and letters swallow up your soul. They have been given over to you. You have not been given over to them.
Rise up. Rise up, for you have the power. You have wings of the spirit, wings of powerful eagles. Do not deny them, or they will deny you. Seek them, and you will find them instantly.

Paragraph 182

The soul of the eternal nation sits and thinks her thoughts.
She weaves into one tapestry all of the thoughts of her worlds.
Racing and returning like a flash of lightning, generations and eras pass before her. She begins from the dreams of her childhood, from the blossoms of her springtime, she reviews all of the toil of her life, she comes to the final days—until [she reaches] the days of the first blossoms, following the extended withering.
She sees the nexus of her thoughts, the considerations of her heart and deeds, and they are meshed [and] intertwined.
And she rises as from sleep to renew her youth in keeping with a practical plan that is old and new, that is diminutive and feeble.
But she is strengthened by the powerful streams of the past. They flow to cascades at the peak of the future. As they proceed, they are attended by primal memories, by remnants of stratagems of a mighty past, which appear like small plants of some mighty and glorious forest of Lebanon, where, after its harmonious cedars, clasping the heights, were destroyed, its shoots began to restore [their] strength. And tender shoots, weak and meager, sprout like wall[-growing] hyssop.
But they are not hyssops, but mighty cedars, which stand at the onset of the start of their growth in a mighty forest.

Paragraph 183

Sometimes thought rises upward, because it desires matters that are all-encompassing and pure. Then the lowly, most minute matters, bound to the pillars of the imagination and routine ordinances, and all the parts of the good and the holy that were bound with them grow feeble, and a person is stupefied, until a clearer light that will [re]build his spiritual ruin [into] a more elevated building gleams for him. And he takes as well all of the depths of the good and the holy, which had been placed within those lowly and superficial matters, and from them he will build a new world, a world filled with great light.

Paragraph 184

He whose soul does not soar in the wide expanses, he who does not seek the light of truth and goodness with all his heart, does not suffer spiritual devastation. But neither does he acquire mighty buildings. He takes shelter in the shade of natural havens, like the hares who take shelter in the clefts of the rock.
But when a person has a robust soul, his soul can shelter only in structures that he erects with his spiritual toil, never ceasing from his vigorous labor.

Paragraph 185

All connections, above and below, are held together as one at the foundation of our life, just as the power of the highest intellect and morality together with the activity of the most material life affect us simultaneously.
From the aspect of the whole, there is no difference between [one] matter and another. Only when we divide matters into particulars do we distinguish between high and low.
And sometimes we must hold onto our low side so that we will not lose the good and holy that depends on it.

Paragraph 186

The [political] state is not the highest happiness of a human being.
That may be said of a regular state, which does not rise to a level higher than that of a society [characterized by] great [mutual] responsibility, [in which] a multitude of ideals—which are the crown of life of humanity—remain hovering above [humanity,] and do not [even] touch it.
This is not the case with a state that is at its foundation idealistic, in whose being is engraved the character of the highest ideal.
That [state] is indeed the greatest happiness of the individual.
That state is in truth the highest [level] on the ladder of happiness.
And that state is our state, the state of Israel, the foundation of the throne of Hashem in the world, whose sole desire is that Hashem will be one and His name one—which is in truth the highest happiness.
It is true that this exalted happiness requires lengthy explanation in order to lift up its light in [these] days of darkness. But not because of that will it cease to be the greatest happiness.

Paragraph 187

Great souls are prepared for the vision of the all to shine in their inner being: from the especially pure and elevated and most universally encompassing aspiration to the farthest and most minute devolution in the particulars of their actions. They want the great light to fill everything. And how great is their pain when the universal light cannot penetrate with its straight flow all of their activities, and they are often required to use a dim light, a secondary light, which somewhat illuminates the shadows, but not with the same flow of light for which the inner core of [their] soul yearns.

Paragraph 188

The question is asked:
We find hidden sorrow in learning the Talmud, although there is also joy in [doing so].
The sorrow comes because, when the heart awakens to the work of the spirit, longings awaken for expansive requests of the spirit that cannot be mixed with limited, practical matters. And the limitation [of those practical matters] oppresses the stream of the spirit and saddens the emotion-possessing soul. Nevertheless, the voice of life that pours forth within all of the boundaries and the miniscule details precision—which are in truth the secret of [this world,] the world of rectification—gladdens the heart and warms the spirit.

Paragraph 189

The measure of sorrow is not felt equally by everyone, but according to the degree to which [each person’s] soul thirsts for a broad, unbounded light.
The sorrow stands in the chambers of the heart. [And it] travels through the spirit of a student engaged in his learning only to the extent that he does not find the largeness in his heart to penetrate to the secret of the magnitude of the spirit of building, who goes [away] from mighty aspirations that have no deeds corresponding to their greatness, until he constricts himself in comfortable structures in keeping with the levels of life in [this-worldly] existence.

Paragraph 190

The world is continuously changing.
Mighty changes occur in the human spirit, just as changes occur in the structures of life because of the ways of [people’s] deed[s] and experience.
But the changes are extrinsic, not intrinsic, just as nature does not change but its powers take on expression in keeping with human activity in various forms.

Paragraph 191

The will is the source of life.
A person’s will is indeed the foundation of his improvement and his being.
It is true that this will requires more development and endeavor than all [other] capabilities.
In humanity’s childhood, a person’s natural will require[d] training [consisting] of submission, crushing and quelling.
The more that humanity improves, [the more] its essential will is transformed to the good. And [then] breaking the will destroys much good.
The matter is very difficult with the setting rays of the sun, between one chapter and another in a significant era of the spirit of humanity, because then, on the one hand, the will contains much wildness, the breaking of which is ascent and development, but on the other hand, the will contains a power of light and good, [and] the improvement of the world depends on [the will] remaining in keeping with its [good] character.
A clear understanding must carefully solve the question of [these two] realms, so that a person will maintain the great might of the aspect of the good in the will that has already been improved, of the aspect of those parts of the soul that have already been redeemed and that have emerged from the chasms of Gehennom and from the depths of the husks, and he must be filled as well with a lowliness of spirit and the character of a broken and oppressed heart, corresponding to those parts of the will in which the evil animal ]nature] of the human being is still immersed, [and] which require purification by its being crushed and broken.

Paragraph 192

Just as practical people, people talented in practical matters and practical realms of knowledge, are not inclined to keen understanding in spiritual matters, and their spiritual sight is impaired and mixed with pallid, narrow guidelines from [this world,] the world of action, to which they are connected, correspondingly, spiritual people, who stand at the height of the world, are not inclined to a complete practical view, and their practical knowledge and the connection of their will to the perfection [of that knowledge] are no more than some shadow that emerges from supernal spiritual matters.
It is true that the supernal spiritual character has a mighty ability to integrate everything, but that is only to the degree [that a person attains] the revelation of prophecy of the “clear lens.”
Therefore, it is said of Moses our teacher himself, “And there was a king in Jeshurun,” [because his elevated prophecy allowed him to be both king and prophet]. But in [subsequent] generations, the king and prophet were separate [people]. As for Samuel, who was, to a certain extent, equal to Moses and Aaron, he had enough spiritual clarity to fulfill as well the [role] of king with the pure flow of his prophecy and his complete spiritual elevation.

Paragraph 193

When people are calm, only healthy emotion guides the world.
But at a time of war, at a time of turbulence, we need counsel and strength.
Sometimes, the innocence of emotion is impaired because of the sophisticated nature of [that] counsel. But that is all worthwhile, [because it is part of] of the stratagems of the war, the war of Hashem. And it is certain that ultimately all that was lost will return, and all that became unclear because of the immense lament [caused by] the disruption of battle will become well-established.

Paragraph 194

The quality of [a person’s] will must be whole, equal to the quality of [his] awareness.
If a person truly loves goodness and truth, then, corresponding to the extent of [that] love, his work to recognize what is good and true will succeed.
[But] if [his] will is flawed, [then his] awareness will necessarily be weakened.
In fact, the special quality of wisdom is that it raises the will and rectifies its flaws.
Therefore, although a person must strive to make [sure] his will is whole, [still, even] if he sees that his will is [still] flawed, he should not set aside [his] constant search for wisdom, [but] he should [continue to] seek it. And corresponding to the intensification of the light of the Torah in his soul, his will will also rise.

Paragraph 195

When a person approaches a state of spiritual awareness, he is weakened. Insight is revealed to him in all its might, and it saps his strength. All of his ethical flaws become evident to him. A terrible thirst for supernal perfection burns in him, and his soul does not find itself able to save itself from the spiritual straits of Sheol in which it finds itself.
This sapping of [his] strength harms the clarity of [his] intellect and dims the sharpness of [his] clear reasoning.
[And] so, in order to actualize [his] human capacity to be a living, aware and enlightened person, he needs, after the deluge of weakness has passed over him, to gird [himself] with all [his] might and to make a strong spiritual connection with a strong resolution to a life of awareness.
And then, day by day, strength of heart in the proper measure will return to him, in the measure that will give him the power to roam in the orchard of supernal mysteries and to guard him, beyond that, from every coarse inclination and from arrogance of the heart.

Paragraph 196

Benighted scholars of spirituality who do not elevate themselves to [attain] clear understandings from within the soul are filled, within themselves, with shame, depression and blackness of thought.
And better than they are the practical thinkers.

Paragraph 197

Every person must remind himself not to learn from the failings of another, [and not to] act as he does. Even if you see that this [other] person is successful and respected, you should know that certainly, corresponding to the defects that you see in him, he has other, [positive] qualities that balance those failings. But as for you, [the fact that] you do not have such a [strong] inclination toward those failings is the essence of your own [positive] quality.
And if, despite [the fact] that you lack other good qualities, you will adapt for yourself as well the failings of that other person, your fall will be very terrible.

Paragraph 198

The complete spiritual outlook, which is the Divine outlook, leads to the highest rectification of society, following a multitude of causes and conduits, of [travels upon] human avenues, and of various arrangements of life.
The supernal flight that rises above the world of deed and its borders is the realm of the great spirit of the human soul.
A human being unites himself, at the peak of his spiritual [ascent], with the spiritual quality that transcends all of his levels. He transcends the borders of time and space, and clear eternity is his inheritance, in its mighty fortitude and on its holy level.
Practical life is self-activated for the good, but [in itself] it cannot spread into all of its most minute details.
[Thus,] the supernal flight must necessarily descend. With its descent, it becomes “a head among the foxes,” a power that domineers and pressures the finite worlds, a power that straightens the paths of deed, study, and limited song.
That is a descent for the supernal light. With this descent, it disperses currents of lights within all of the boundaries, to the practical avenues and to active aspirations. “She gives food to her household and a share to her maidens” (Proverbs 31:15).
When that share is full and the currents can provide sufficient water, the flow of light rises, unites with its source, [and] embraces its beloved. And the soul of all creation rises to the source of Divine emanation.
[Then] the spirit of man corresponding to [the flow of light] rises higher than all the structures of practical life, and contemplates that which is absolutely upright, in the radiance of the ultimate truth.

Paragraph 199

There is a necessary break between the character of the abstract ideal regarding the goal of all [being]and that which it reveals in actual existence, between the good intent emanated to man at the highest peak of his spiritual life and the spirit that accompanies him always to straighten out his deeds and his ways.
If not for this hierarchical distinction, the form of deeds would be entirely blurred, existence would not maintain its character, laws and boundaries would not be firm, permanent qualities and defining values that establish the entire world would not stand.
The light is constricted. It sometimes descends much, too much, from its might. With its constriction, [whose purpose is] that its character may be appreciated, it reaches [areas of] darkness. Happily for [that light], conduits are drawn from the abstract goal into the midst of boundaries, of the impress of particulars.
[These conduits] sprinkle the dew of supernal life, and that dew is the dew of lights. It expels the shadows and illuminates life.
And the same occurs in a person and in the nation, in the world and in existence.

Paragraph 200

Regarding the movements of pure perspectives, even the images that come from them gladden the soul of the individual and rectify society in a proper manner. And in the structures of [their] elevations, [these images] make it possible, across the course of eras, to penetrate to the light hidden in their inner being.
And every person with a pure heart and pure outlook must be very careful not to disdain [these] images, [which are] branches of supernal states of sanctity. He should consider a fortiori that a person who benefits even from wood and stone that were dedicated to the Temple [is guilty of] misappropriating, [because even the wood and stone are sanctified—how much more are these images sanctified].
When the spirit is weak, the masses denigrate [these] holy images, and as a result they lose their way, until the sun of the person with a mighty intellect, who possesses an upright heart, shines, a person who teaches the people the respect that is fitting even for holy images, and shows their relationship to the supernal happiness in the [realms of] eternal purity.
And out of this illumination of the world, the spirit of teshuvah comes and hovers in the world, and redemption begins to appear.
However, there are also images that destroy their own power of life, which stray on a roadway filled with shadows until they come to such a state that truth rises up with great zealousness to uproot them.

Paragraph 201

Just as sensory existence is impressed upon continuous movement, so [too] ideational existence is impressed upon unceasing joy. The world is joyful. All of inner existence is joyful.
Partial obstructions partially stop movement. And obstructions of that type in the inner world stop joy.
The spirit of life descends from the movement of its intrinsic joy due to the stoppages [caused by] its imprisonment in the work [required in] natural, unformed life. For its lack of joy, it substitutes hopes of happiness, which it visualizes in accordance with its situation.
The spirit continues to grow [until] it recognizes clearly, in accordance with its growth, the sorts of emptiness in those hopes, and its core of joy descends. [But] it [continues to] grow a great deal, until it recognizes that there is no reason for the stopping of the original joy, the existential joy, the joy of the “eternal habitation,” and [that the spirit] need no longer weave images of disappointing hopes.
“And the righteous will rejoice, they will exult before Hashem and they will delight with joy” (Psalms 68:4).

Paragraph 202

“If you heed the old, you will heed the new” (Berachot 40a).
One of the foundations that rescues thought from annihilation is delving into the old.
That which is new will rise and flower. It will blossom and flower and greatly increase. Nevertheless, we always need the depth of the spirit of the old.
This matter is pertinent, most of all, to abstract spiritual perspectives, and [this matter] extends [to affect] a multitude of other branches that relate to [these perspectives].
The more that [a person’s] spirit raises him to travel upon [the paths of] wisdom, to know the spirit of awareness that emanates [from] its unencumbered height and that can be described in our times, [this person], and precisely he, will find his treasure, a vast property, when he turns to the old, to the Torah and to the tradition, to all of the words of the sages and their enigmas, to [the Torah’s] thought, whether revealed or hidden.
All of [this] wealth together sets before us the stature of thought as a fully [integrated] unit.
The [present] era forgets, in the clamor of its pride, to speak about the Creator. It is weakened, due [its] extremity of feeling, so that it does not bless the glory of His name. The spirit is enfeebled by the agitations of scorners who are empty-minded. Thought withers and feeling grows obtuse.
[A person] must break these iron cables with freedom and with might. [We] must return to the old, to the healthy mode, to the holy glory, to recognize the Creator and creation, to feel [that He] “is good and does good.”
The song will then be freed, the hymn will rise to the heights of its heavens. And all of the perspectives of the world that come from life and goodness, that are connected to purity and justice—whether they are revealed perspectives, [which may be] explained with intellect and logic, or whether they are hidden perspectives, which only the mystical overview and the wellspring of divine inspiration, in whatever manner, pours forth such streams—everything must be clarified, interpreted, appraised, and revealed.
And [even if] none of the wicked will understand, that is of no account, because the wise will understand.
The supernal freedom of thought will nullify arrogance of mind and smallness of faith. And words that were not understood will in the end be understood.
And [that] understanding will gather together to [become] a great focus, a penetrating power, an arousing voice that restores banished souls to their tranquil home, that strengthens spirits that stumble under the heaviness of their sin, that places the lowly in the heights, “and those blackened are exalted by salvation” (Job 5:11).

Paragraph 203

In the depth of their being, [those with] great souls feel their connection to all existence and, in particular, to all of the animals in the scope of their knowledge and, even more, to all human beings.
And these profoundly strong, inclusive ideas intensify a rising and falling ability that clarifies the minutest [details of their] relationship with themselves and with their families, with their nation, and [the details] of every other such relationship.
And the details of [these] inclinations bond with each other constantly and generate lights of a new life.

Paragraph 204

The slightest and smallest personal inclination that possesses nothing but its innocence and natural disposition: the power that controls it, that catalyzes it and directs its alignment with the inclinations outside it—so that with this blend it will reach its goal—is the most universal power, the goal-driven content in the supernal sweep of being.

Paragraph 205

The mystical vision speaks. The power of life that was revealed in Jacob’s sheep is the storehouse of the souls of Israel.
A shepherd has a close connection with his flock. [And] Jacob exerted a hidden influence on the living soul of these sheep.
Creation brought this treasury of life close to and in touch with the unique great father, who himself in his entire soul is the life of the nation: Grandfather Israel. [And] all of the details of smaller Israel—that is to say, the details about the entire nation’s individuals—are the sparks of his flame of life.
Humanity cannot bring forth from within itself a type of soul like the souls of Israel. The aspiration of [the people of Israel] is entirely different. It does not exist among all of the families on earth.
In a minor state of life, as that in the measure of the soul of a sheep, the influence of the shepherd is very deeply impressed.
The stream of life continuously rises. It gains perfection through a number of channels: sometimes gradually and sometimes by discontinuously.
These are the holy flock of the house of Israel. Their living spirit is the spirit of the flock of Jacob, directed by his influence.
“And you, My flock of My shepherding: you are man” (Ezekiel 34:31).

Paragraph 206

The Divine song is awake in the soul of the greatest of the righteous people, and so at times they cannot engage in any specific [action] that requires accounting and thought, because the pleasantness of the song overwhelms all being and blurs specific forms with its sweet radiance.
And [the righteous people] bring the pleasantness of the supernal song to all practical matters and all matters of the practical Torah. Precisely in that way, [these righteous people] gain an entrance into all practical matters, in action and in learning.

Paragraph 207

The spiritual components of the aspects of holiness must be tested scientifically, as one tests chemicals, to know the details of the elements [that form] a compound. In keeping with that, we can innovate much and generate new components by combining mixtures, and purify and raise old materials, just as in the practice of chemistry.

Paragraph 208

This is the order [of things].
[A person] must purify and strengthen [his] body and all of its abilities. Then [he must turn to] the faculty of the imagination, and all of its divisions, which must also be strong and purified. Then comes emotion and all of its branches. And above them comes the clear intellect and all of its divisions, and [then] the light of supernal attention, which comes from the light of supernal Godly inspiration, which is higher than all of them.

Paragraph 209

This order applies not only to individuals but to the entire nation. And these matters correspond to various eras in the course of [the nation’s] life.

Paragraph 210

The great righteous people incorporate everything into their soul. They possess all of the good of the all, and [they possess] as well all of the evil of the all. They endure suffering on behalf of the all, and they receive delight from the all, and they transform all of the evil of the all to good.
And because they are meliorated by the sufferings they endure, through them everything is meliorated, because the root of their soul contains the capacity of the divisions of the very many souls, whose foundation is [these] righteous people.

Paragraph 211

We see that every [branch of] wisdom can be self-enclosed, without much reliance on another. And [in addition, this-]worldly wisdoms [may be] studied without requiring the [knowledge of] supernal, spiritual wisdoms.
From that, we learn that the Divine wisdom and all of its divisions may be studied without any need for any of the other wisdoms.
Still, although [lack of knowledge of] the external wisdoms does not hinder [attaining] the inner wisdoms, [knowledge of the external wisdoms will] crown [the inner wisdoms].
And to the degree that [the external wisdoms] encompass [inner wisdom], they are revealed as being sparks that are a part of [the inner wisdoms’] exceedingly mighty light.

Paragraph 212

There are masters of clear comprehension and great righteous people who, out of the great desire of their heart to attain clear metaphysical comprehension and truly cling to Hashem, may He be blessed, cannot extend their mind to details of halachot and particular actions.
This is a personal deficiency and weakness. Nevertheless, it emerges from the source of purity. And that is alluded to in the verse, “If a person loses the hair on his head, he is bald. He is clean [of ‘leprosy’]” (Leviticus 13:40). [Although he is imperfect, he is pure.]
Higher than that is the holiness of the nazirite, [because] “the crown of his God” (Number 6:7) is upon him, since “he allows the hair of his head to grow wild” (ibid. 5).
And [this alludes to] Rabbi Akiva, who derived from every point [of the letters of the Torah] mounds upon mounds of halachot (Menachot 29b). As the verse states, “His locks [of hair] are curled” (Song of Songs 5:11). [The Hebrew for “locks” can be read as “points” and the Hebrew for “curled” can be read as “mounds.”]
The verse continues, “[they are] black [<i>shachor</i>] as a raven [<i>oreiv</i>],” and our Sages teach: “In whom do you find [the words of Torah]? In a person who, for [the Torah’s] sake, blackens his face like a raven, [fasting and depriving himself], or in a person who, for its sake, always rises early [<i>shachar</i>] and stays late into the evening [<i>erev</i>], or [in a person] who makes himself as cruel as a raven to his children” [because he dedicates himself to Torah learning] (Eiruvin 21b-22a).

Paragraph 213

Most people live a life of imagination, and they completely lack the ability to live a life of intellect.
Accordingly, all the parts of their lives must align with each other. Even the postulates of their faith are imaginal postulates, corresponding to the level of the entirety of their lives.
But imagination and intellect are not divided, each a separate unit. Rather, they are differentiated incrementally.
At [certain] levels, imagination grows more clear. [On the level of those] parts, it is so purified that it enters the realm of the intellect. And sometimes intellect descends in its divisions and enters the realm of the imagination.
In general, the essential difference is distance from or closeness to clear awareness. [The difference is] not intrinsic.
[That is] because, in the end, a person only has a shadowy knowledge of everything.
Matters on a greater level, extremely relevant to the intrinsic spiritual character of a person as a whole or in his particulars are especially clothed in all [of these] garments: the garments of the intellect, in accordance with its levels, or the garments of the imagination, in accordance with the divisions of its levels.
A person must guard [himself] intensively so that his imagination will not be destroyed, so that the matters fundamentally good rooted in the depth of [his] intellect will not shift away from spreading their branches over [his] imagination.
A person who has destroyed the action of [his] imagination in the fundamental matters [of his life] is cut off.
And if the entire nation has reached such a state, it is impoverished.
The congregation of Israel is crowned by its true faith, [because] [its] imagination can be connected closely to all of the truth. Its imagination is a garment that adorns the content of intellect and truth. And in this way, it increases the glory of life and its might within [the nation].
Whoever has apprehended Judaism well feels every subtlest flaw in [any] flaw of [his] imagination, and he carefully guards himself from [that].
And when the imagination is whole, not destroyed by the force of distortions of feelings and spoliations in this-worldly life, [then] intellectual, spiritual, and practical movement flows in all of the chambers of life: of the individual and of the community.
And when small-minded people come and disparage the imagination of the nation, forces enter the body of the imagination that cause the spirit to tremendously retreat—until the illnesses will be healed, and the intellect and imagination will return to [their] work, in balance [with each other].

Paragraph 214

We must explain how all of the deeds, laws and details of the mitzvot emerge from awareness and emotions, which are the foundations of the nation’s soul, and which build the national thought and feeling with their repeated activity.
And when we cease to act, emotion and thought are corroded, the soul grows impoverished, and a terrible rot continuously festers.

Paragraph 215

At this time, one must explain all matters of faith, Torah and service through the pathway of the intellect.

Paragraph 216

It is impossible to overcome any general evil uprising, whether in the world in general or among [the people of] Israel in particular, unless we take all of its aspects and guide them in the good and holy way.

Paragraph 217

Creativity proceeds on its way. It creates all of its levels. It aspires to the most refined and exalted state of being, through which will appear all of the distillate of all being, all of its strength and might, all of its beauty, uprightness, and wisdom.
That is the entire soul of the human being, [of] the choicest [person], who is the one who has perfected himself with [his] free will, the one who has perfected his character with his will, [bringing his soul] to the side of the most supernal good, until he reveals a creative aspect that has the character of actuating total goodness.
The supernal soul finds itself its might and strength within itself. It needs nothing outside itself. It is satisfied. And, since it is the distillate of all, with the universal power within itself it draws life to all, [to everything] that is incomplete in all of the hues of that incompleteness.
And the masses, the people who possess [only] sections of creation, do not find [the fulfillment of] what they lack within their inner being. They must [proceed] a great deal until what they lack will be fulfilled, [until] a bit of the flaw of their essence will be rectified—because [even] after all of these [efforts, their soul] is not entirely rectified until [it is helped] by the supernal righteous person, who has a central soul.
“A heavenly voice comes from Mt. Horeb and says, ‘The entire world is sustained for the sake of Chanina My son, and for Chanina My son one kab of carobs from one Sabbath eve to the next suffices” (Berachot 17b).

Paragraph 218

How pathetic is “realism” when it defines itself as being self-contained and wishes to disconnect [itself] entirely from a person’s spiritual light.
[Although] it illuminates [our] awareness regarding matters that surround and fill the scope of our feelings, it darkens the world when it wishes to gain sovereignty over everything.
A person who cleaves to “realism” will constantly sink ever further into it. It will draw him after it little by little, and if he will not awaken the spiritual thread in his heart and the spark of light in his soul, it will grow increasingly dim, until [the] person cleaving to “realism” will no longer be able to recognize any true soulful contents and his soul will remain desolate, even if he is learned, ethical, and accomplished.
When “realistic” achievers are dedicated to some ideal that engages them, they are placed in a state of a tremendous internal struggle.
Viewed “realistically,” there is no reason to be dedicated to any ideal, because the [source] of every ideal that interests and attracts the heart is the aspect of its ethical might, which is itself a spiritual, soulful value, which “realism” does not encompass.
Therefore, if a person will be devoted [to something] with a whole heart, his spiritual nature will intensify, and he will emerge from [his] immersion in the depths of “realism” as a result of [his] devotion to [that] “realism” itself, because the idealism in [his] devotion itself will purify the content of [his] inner life, and [his] spiritual awareness will grow pronounced within him.
[But] if [his] devotion is not [really] pure, then it will not last, and it will grow continuously colder, and at best it will not be able to produce fruit in order to influence others, especially the coming generations, with its character.
The eternal goal that lives within us will therefore force us to desire the ideal content, and it will not let us rest in a limited and dry “realism.”

Paragraph 219

Faith is neither intellect nor emotion, but the most fundamental self-revelation of the character of the soul. [That self-revelation] must guide [the soul in keeping] with [the soul’s] character.
And when we do not corrupt the way [of the soul that is] natural to itself, it needs no other component [outside itself] to sustain it, [because] it finds everything within itself.
When its light weakens, then intellect and emotion come to clear the path before it.
And then too it must know its worth: that not its servants, [which are] intellect and feeling, are its might.
[Then] it will be established in its firm habitation. Then intellect and feeling will succeed in clearing the way and in producing the intellectual and ethical ways that [will] remove the stumbling blocks from its path.
The special perspective of faith, which is itself a portion of Hashem, is the light of prophecy. And when [that] level descends, [it is] the flow of Divine inspiration. [Both of these] at times descend and unite with intellect and feeling in the ways that [the latter] reveal themselves.

Paragraph 220

One must know that it is impossible to turn to Hashem, may He be blessed, with any intellect or any emotion or, even more, with any sensory faculty, but only with faith. Prayer is faith, and fear and love are also revelations of faith.
And the fact that people speak of a “sense of faith” or a “feeling of faith” and, how much more, if we speak of knowledge of faith or intellect of faith—these are only borrowed terms, because the essence of faith has nothing [to do with] them, but it is rather higher than all of them. It lacks nothing at all, [but] it encompasses in supernal oneness and wholeness a distillation that is more precious and strong than all of the above.

Paragraph 221

Faith and love are always bound to each other when they both shine fully in the soul. And when the light of one of them is completely whole, its power arouses the other, which emerges from the depths of the soul to shine in all of its totality.

Paragraph 222

A person is prepared for no spiritual power in the world with a great completeness as he is prepared for faith and love. And that is the indication that in their capacity inhere all of the foundations of the being of our character.

Paragraph 223

Everything that the individual and the community do in all of the causes and effects and in all of the capacities that are revealed in a civilized life—it all goes to consummate faith and love on a supernal level.

Paragraph 224

From faith and love emanate all of the spiritual lights in the world that illuminate all of the ways of life and existence.
Faith and love are the essence of life—in this world and in the world-to-come. Nothing remains in life when these two lights, faith and love, are stolen from it.

Paragraph 225

The present culture, as it is now based in the world, is entirely built on heresy and hatred, which negate the essence of life. It is only possible to overcome this sickness by revealing all of the treasuries of the good that lie in the storehouse of faith and love. And that is goal of the revelation of the secrets of the Torah.

Paragraph 226

Torah is love, and the mitzvot are faith. And they are also the conduits through which the stream of faith and love flows continuously. And all of the culture, spiritual and material, of Israel, with the [present] arousal of its national life, must be consolidated entirely around this united double center [of] “two that are four” (m. Shabbat 1:1): Torah and mitzvot, faith and love.

Paragraph 227

The perfecting of faith and love and of the might of their existence is fortified in the foundation of [a person’s] spirit clinging to sages and their students, or, in the Hasidic phrase, “being connected to the tzaddikim.”
We must raise this foundation, which Hasidism has discussed extensively, improve it greatly and appreciate it deeply as a treasury of life and a footstool to the Shechinah that contains the light of faith and love, which saturates the righteous sages, the quality of whose lives is entirely the revelation of faith and love, as contained in the might of the Torah and the mitzvot in their total fullness, [both] this-worldly and spiritual—with a special quality, the quality of Divine inspiration, which is suited to be born specifically in the land of Israel.

Paragraph 228

“Cultured” people who are wicked, who lack faith and love, are not disposed to cling together, not even among themselves. They are similar to ash that cannot be kneaded together. “And you shall pulverize the wicked, because they will be ash beneath the soles of your feet” (Malachi 3:21). And so their life is not a life, and they are considered dead [even] in their lifetime.
However, by employing great faith and broad love, we shall bring down the dew of revival with which to revive even the dead. “May Your dead live. ‘My corpses shall rise,’… because a dew of lights is Your dew, and You will cast the shirkers down to the ground” (Isaiah 26:19).

Paragraph 229

We yearn for the revival of the nation and the revival of the land so that our soul will be revived, so that Israel will be established [and] alive, so that faith and love will be revived in the strength of the Torah and the mitzvot in all their complete fullness.
We recognize the light of the God of Israel, the eternal God, and the delight “on Hashem” (Psalms 37:4)—specifically, “on” Hashem, higher than any expression and any concept, higher than “any blessing and song, praise and consolation” (Kaddish), a hidden and concealed [light] that is revealed in the light of faith and love, which appear in the system of the entire Torah and [its] mitzvot.
We seek Zion. We yearn to build the land and to be built by it, in order to absorb its spirit and its atmosphere, to unite with all of the life that is connected to it.
Therefore, we seek much Torah. And to that end, we yearn for complete health and for tough and sturdy physical strength. We seek many mitzvot so that we will have sufficient vessels to contain the great light of faith and love with all of their delight and refinement, and all of their light and purity, their might and robustness, so that they will appear to us in their full measure, as we return to an independent national life in the sense of its fullness and its height.
We love all that we have of ancient memories, of mitzvot and ordinances as much as we love life, because they are our vessels [to receive life from] the source of life, and with them is [that] source of life. The ideals hidden in them live with them and with their existence.

Paragraph 230

As soon we start to look at Godly matters, we tremble, and thus [our] intellect wanes.
Therefore, at first glance we do not reach clear understanding in the structures of life proposed] by [our] pure [and holy] philosophers and in the ways of living and acting in accordance with [those structures], until we grow stronger as our mind becomes settled, and the feeling of fear ceases its raging as a result of [our] mind’s calm. And then we begin to have clear thoughts, which have [both] literary usefulness and practical usefulness.

Paragraph 231

It is a sickly evil when [a person’s] ethical feeling grows overly refined, until it acts not only as a faculty that keeps [him], in the practical realm, from stretching forth his hand to do evil, but it threatens him constantly with the fear of sins, in action and in thought, that surround him.
An exaggerated fear of every sin destroys a person’s good and makes him a sort of lowly creature that does nothing but lie down and tremble.
A person must believe in his life: [he must] believe both in his physical power and his ethical power.
Faith includes everything, as does love.
Faith in life is a blessing from Hashem, just as lack of faith is the most terrible curse—“and you will not believe in your life” (Deuteronomy 28:66).
When a person believes in his spiritual life, he finds satisfaction in what he does, and he rises upward.

Paragraph 232

A person must strive a great deal to improve [his] traits. But heaven forbid that—if the purification of [his] traits is delayed—he defer rising to the aspect of the greatness of [his] spirit and intellectual sight.
Conversely, it is entirely impossible for [his] traits to be purified without the elevation of a great spirit [within him].
And the greater a person is, the greater [his] need to improve his spiritual-intellectual world, so that the true character of [how to] purify [his] traits will be clear to him.

Paragraph 233

A profound spirit cannot satisfy itself with superficiality. It is intrinsically unprepared to arrange for itself a moderate way of conduct.
It wishes to penetrate to the depth of everything, and [to penetrate] to the ultimate edge of every attribute.
But the Divine creation comes upon [such a person] as an edict so that he is balanced, and the extremities do not prevail too much upon him.

Paragraph 234

There is more faith and clinging to the Divine [attained] with uprightness of awareness and with good traits than [that which is attained] with faith that is verbal and imagery-emotional.

Paragraph 235

The yearning for Divine wholeness, [which comes] with the development of all of the powers of the soul in its full strength, is an overwhelming power that drives [a person’s] spiritual life to its goal.
The terrible thirst for the dew of revivification, which comes from [that revivification’s] supernal light, contains the entire fulness, in action and intellect: everything that is within the boundary of human free will as well as everything higher than that, which is continuously revealed in consequence of the soul attaining strength from its original radiance.
The soul of life cannot be satisfied by seeking practical arrangements, repairs in the pathways of life and society, and by political and communal improvements.
It is true that when any of these are damaged, [the soul] is sequestered from a number of means that could have helped it [attain] its overall wholeness. But [those means] do not constitute its tranquility and objective.
[The soul] seeks the Divine light. [It seeks] wholeness that is practical and intellectual, emotional and psychological: complete wholeness.
[The soul] connects [itself] to the light of supernal yearning. It nestles in [its] love for its Maker. It rises to enjoy the radiance of concept, intellect, thought, imagination and feeling, the soulful connection and the self’s immersion in the sea of illumination of “the light of Torah and the lamp of the mitzvah” (Proverbs 6:23).

Paragraph 236

Rabbi Hisdai Crescas associated faith with joy, which is also associated with love.
[A person] can [attain these] by [maintaining] a constant, clear gaze at spiritual concepts [and] by intensifying the spiritual good, [which he does] by studying [these] supernal [concepts and their] encompassing overview.
There are enlightened people who are permanently involved in [learning] the secrets of the Torah. The universal light will be revealed in all of its splendor to them.
The more students [they have] who seek clarity [as they] learn matters of faith, love, and joy, the stronger and more alert will the nation’s collective soul become.
Of course, an increase of power must be accompanied by order and measure. And that comes about by means of knowledge—whether general knowledge or [a more detailed] step-by-step knowledge of the [concepts] of the ways of faith themselves, in keeping with the judgment of history [regarding those concepts].
Although this [knowledge] does not give [a person] the deep and rich content of the holy and deep treasures of faith, it at any rate helps contribute a character of knowledge to the entire wealth of [his] spirit, [and that knowledge] accumulates [until it results] in a great flow, in consequence of [his] inner learning.

Paragraph 237

Free inquiry cannot harm a heart that has absorbed the essential profundity of the nature of faith, which is the foundation of the clearest elevation of a person’s soul. On the contrary, it will grant him added greatness and beauty.
But as long as [this] supernal essence has not been well-absorbed into [his] heart, [and] its power to conduct [his] deeds and the feelings in his life has collapsed, [his] every free inquiry uproots the foundation of [any] possibility that [his] good feeling, which stands higher than [his] logical intellect, will function. That [free] inquiry will afterwards turn into a sort of stubborn heresy, which is one of the greatest illnesses of the psyche.

Paragraph 238

The nature of the human body, accompanied by the powers of the psyche that stream in consonance with the character and power of the body, is comparable to the nature of the most evil beast. It is not fit to gather [with others] or to rectify the world—and, how much more, it is not fit to develop within itself the elevated spiritual senses that bring a person refined delight, such as the refinement of [spiritual] awareness and of [a sense of] justice, and, in general, a constant aspiration to rise with an inner elevation, and the ability to recognize what [such an] inner elevation is, and how it constantly proceeds from strength to strength.
In order for a person to conquer the powers of his body—to conquer [it] not by breaking [it] down but to conquer [it] by subjugating and completely transforming [it]—the light of [his] soul must appear in the world. [His soul] must appear in all of its might and greatness. That is the goal of the entire spiritual illumination of yearning for knowledge, and of every supernal spiritual longing, until one reaches the highest point of the radiance of the Almighty.

Paragraph 239

To believe and to implement is an ability unique to the congregation of Israel.
Faith is the central foundation, but it is firm and completes its mission only in combination with deed.
In order to believe in that which it is possible to implement, we need balance. That is the balance of the Torah that grasps righteous justice in accordance with a human being’s ability.
Christianity calls for belief, but it cannot implement. Therefore, it calls for “presenting the other cheek.”
Clearly, a society can at best believe that this trait is exalted—but it cannot implement [it].
But the Torah of truth emerges from the holy balance, which is as true in deed as it is in thought. The wealth of faith is faith that is also practical. “Live in the land and shepherd faith” (Psalms 37:3).

Paragraph 240

When a person engages in teshuvah, he must clearly demarcate the nature of good and evil so that his regret and the sharp shift of his will from approval to disapproval will pertain only to the evil and not to the good.
Moreover, a person must clarify the good that is to be found within the depth of evil and strengthen [that good], to the same degree that he flees evil, so that his teshuvah will work for the good, literally transforming all of his wilful sins to merits.

Paragraph 241

The soul of the Jewish people is the absolute righteousness that, when realized, comprises all actualized ethical goodness.
Therefore, any ethical flaw that any individual Jew engages in weakens his connection to the soul of the entire Jewish people.
The initial, fundamental teshuvah is to connect oneself to the soul of the nation.
Together with it, it is necessary to rectify all paths and deeds. [This must be] in accordance with the characteristic quality within the soul of the nation.

Paragraph 242

The very peak of the nation’s soul is [itself] the universal goal toward which the nation aspires with the essence of its being. And [all of] this has already affected the totality of existence. The supernal concept of teshuvah is embedded in this concealed height.

Paragraph 243

The souls of wicked people with principles, those who sin in order to anger [God] and not because of desire, are very high, [coming] from the “lights of chaos.”
They have chosen destruction, and [so] they destroy. The world grows dim because of them, and they together with it.
But the essence of the power of their will is a point of holiness. [And] when [this point] is absorbed into souls whose steps are measured, it gives them the strength of life.
In times of redemption, insolence increases.
Then those flaming souls whom no boundary and limitation can stop reveal their power. [And] then the built-up world, with all of its settled residents, people who are measured and genteel, are stunned and cannot deal with them.
Woe! “Who will stand up for us against a consuming fire?” Woe! “Who will stand up for us against everlasting flames?” (Isaiah 33:14).
But in truth, “there never was such fear” (Psalms 53:6). Fear and trembling only seize weak and fawning souls. But people who are vigorous and strong know that the revelation of this power is something prophesied, coming for the sake of perfecting the world, coming for the sake of reinforcing the powers of [our] nation.
Although at first [this] power appears in the form of chaos, it will be taken from the hands of the wicked and placed in the hands of the righteous, of people mighty as lions, who will, with the mighty spirit of a lucid and mighty intellect and with a personal force of feeling and practical, permanent, and clear revelation, reveal the truth of the rectification and construction.

Paragraph 244

And the world of chaos, with its breakages and rectifications, teaches us that the power of the will for rectification, for perfection, for existence—which are the absolute good—functions with a power that is full: very, very full.
Existence cannot receive the entire might of goodness of the supernal One Who brings into being, the One Who is mighty with infinite power.
Partial existence melts away due to the vastness of the good, due to the might of life. It breaks down due to the vastness of its aspiration.
But not because of that will the exalted good cease from making its way.
[The exalted good] returns and builds after the breakage. And the rectified structure rises very, very well. It is precious without equal.
So much vaster is the measure of good than the measure of misfortune that it is worthwhile bearing all of the sufferings of the breakage, all of the injuries of destruction, just so that such perfected worlds will emerge, which in their might bear such a wealth of life that it is beyond their own intrinsic power.
The supernal One Who brings into being does not choose a measured and constricted path in keeping with the measure of the ability of existence, because if He did, then the good would be limited, not in accordance with the mighty vigor of the life of the Creator of all, but entirely in accordance with the conditions of weak existence.

Paragraph 245

The heart must be carefully guarded.
[And] that which applies to the individual heart [applies] as well to the communal heart.
The power of the psyche that dominates [a person’s this-worldly] life is [actually] the soul element that has lowered itself from the height of its abstract might to guide the powers of the body.
[This power of the psyche] must be a sort of model of that which is above. [It must be] planted in the nature of its [upper] root—the supernal soul of the living God—which is revealed in the illumination of the highest human life: in a life of wisdom and exalted concepts.
But [below,] the expressions of the psyche are connected to their specific character, for whose sake [human beings have] a fundamental need for a finite ethics regarding deed and perspectives.
Those who cut off the shoots [to their soul] cut off the psychological branches of their lives from [those branches’] supernal root. They impoverish the whole, and destroy a very considerable part of their power.
[A person’s] supernal intellect will clarify the ways in which [his] lucid, abstract awareness proceeds and comes to the bottom of the character of [his] psyche.
But despite all of [his] many ways to clarify [these matters], the fact will not change—thus must the matter be and [thus] will [it] necessarily be—that [a person’s] states of awareness will descend to the constitution of the character of [his] psyche, to dwell in [his] psyche as reified objects, and with them all of the deeds that crown them and accompany them.
The heresies that are crystallized in speech are, [our] tradition teaches us, diseases that sever the life-force of the psyche so that no wisdom will work to bind [the aspects of the life force back] unless they return to their might with a clear speech of faith that grasps the root of supernal knowing, which is revealed to every person in keeping with the level of his consciousness.
“A person who says that there is no revival of the dead from the Torah, that there is no Torah from heaven, and a heretic” (Sanhedrin 90a)—who derides holiness until that includes his derision of Torah sages—destroys the connection of his psychological life and [his] entire emotional, organic relationship with the root of life of the Torah and the mitzvot, and of the nation in its practical-spiritual character.
No other concocted affections can fill the lack [caused by] the severing of this conduit.
Teshuvah is needed for such blunderers to return speech to its might. Speech will restore feeling, and feeling will rise to the heights of knowledge, to be a complete and inclusive unit.

Paragraph 246

How much truth and song appear before us in the vision [that shows] the human soul’s centrality in relation to all existence.
This vision is not compromised by the realization that the form of the cosmos is sweeping and infinite, with worlds of stars [and] with the constant creation of nebulae.
On the contrary, this song grows. It is strengthened by that immensity and greatness.
That centrality is revealed wherever the light of life is revealed to [a person’s] awareness, and laudable ethics and refined aspirations coalesce.
A spiritual human being’s [integrated] oneness encompasses him in all of his discoveries regarding all worlds, like [an object whose] gravitational force pulls equally on all the entities [around it].
In vain do people with a limited vision think that, after the recent discovery of the parameters of the universe, the centrality of the spirit of man has been erased, and they wish to say that as a result the value of religion is derogated.
Religion is firm in the hearts of those—such as the Rambam and his camp—who never accepted [the concept] of the centrality of man. Therefore, the claim [that this new understanding of the universe devalues religion] is null from the very outset.
But even in the depth of the mystical idea [of the centrality of man], which inhabits an important place in religious life—[and which has] in particular spread extensively in recent generations—nothing has been damaged. On the contrary, the vision is intensified.
[A person’s] ethical responsibility grows in accordance with [his awareness of] the interconnected nature of such a universe. And that too adds energy to his spirit in his [quest to] make himself whole.
Of course, due to this image of the awesome greatness of [our] ethical responsibility, [a person] must have a deep and lucid illumination regarding the composition of ethics, so that [his] spirit will not melt away due to being overwhelmed by fear, and he will [not] lack the courage required of the person who is active in life.

Paragraph 247

In the education of the individual, as well as in the education of people overall—of [our] nation and of humanity—we must take heed of a psychological unity: i.e., that intellect should directly influence emotion, emotion [should influence] imagination, and imagination [should influence] action.
When there is a contradiction among these parts, destruction will find something to attach itself to.
And upon these four parts—intellect, emotion, imagination, [and] action]—that which is supernal, the root of the soul of the individual and of the community, rises to the source of supernal being.

Paragraph 248

How much goodness [do people] block with [their own] hands because of their lowly awareness. It is fitting that the spirit of Hashem pulse in their hearts, but they hold onto smallness, and they do not believe in themselves, in the greatness of their souls.
Neither [a person’s] environment nor [his specific] deeds are the foundations upon which the soul’s happiness is built in its inner storehouse. [The soul’s happiness is built upon] the greatness of [his] psychology, [his] inner holiness and purity, the might of [his] will and the strength of [his] thought.
When [a person’s] spiritual might rises, [his] environment and deeds are subjugated before it.
Therefore, the great righteous people engage principally in [attaining] inner greatness. Of course, they are also exacting in [their] deeds [and] they strive [to increase] the purity of [their] environment. But all of this emerges from the inner factor of supernal illumination, which streams in [a person’s] soul in all of the splendor of its greatness, from the greatest and most flowing conduit—and [these people] filled with a spirit that rises upward will not lower themselves to constantly cling to the smallness of particular exactitudes.
In general, it is not the sensory world in the exactitudes of its deeds that plays the largest role in the eternal soul of life—which appears in the light of its greatness in [people with] supernal souls—but the elevated glory of the beauty of the Life of worlds, in Whom everything is incorporated: all of the conceptual, ethical and active good.
The spreading of wholeness across all deeds comes of itself when [a person’s] great will for the Divine good in the vastness of its purity acts with all its might.
At any rate, the righteous people at times turn from their great elevation and look at their deeds in the smallest details—after they have already been sated with the radiance of refinements from the supernal delight and [their] spirit filled with might has been encouraged and strengthened. [Then] the desire for goodness and purity, filled with the light of life, lives within [their] heart. A personal accounting comes with greatness and beauty to [deal with the] details and the finest details. [And] there comes as well a psychological and bodily melancholy, like a flowing river and terrific thunder: fear and greatness, hope and trust, and aspiration for rectification of every flaw, [for] supernal teshuvah that incorporates all teshuvot.

Paragraph 249

When righteous people discover flaws in their actions, [and] even when they see that it is impossible to repair them, they do not fall from their supernal level, because they know that the reason for [their] lack of ability to repair every failing is that the light of [their] soul—which is the true power of life—has not yet shone upon all of the branches of the divisions of life [within them].
Therefore, they strive to rise to higher levels with understanding and a clear spirit, so that [their] soul will be especially strengthened and reveal itself to them.
And they are assured that with the greatness of the appearance of the soul their strength will grow so much that they will be able to repair everything that has been distorted: whether in [their] spirit or in [their] actions, whether near or far, and whether in dealing with God or in dealing with other people—[two areas] between which they do not see any intrinsic difference.

Paragraph 250

[A person’s] soul greatness that aspires to supernal holiness and to great and elevated matters must also engage in repairing [his] traits and deeds, and must sometimes descend to the depths of this-worldly life and probe its finest details, in order to repair them and direct them in keeping with justice and law, in keeping with the Torah and halachah. And he must penetrate into the depths of [his] psychological traits, in order to remove all evil and all distortion from them.
If [a person] directs [his] attention only to rising, and not to the bottommost purity and holiness, all of that supernal light may break and become a stumbling block. The greatness of [his] soul may be transformed into a strange egotism, and [his] yearning for knowledge of tremendous mysteries [may be transformed] into a delusion that takes pride in the variety of its hues.
And [a person’s] might of spirit that elevates the appearance of [his] life may arouse [his] stormy bodily desires. Desire for profit, honor, and sensory delights may burst through all boundaries. And [then,] from the summit of a mighty, supernal, angelic aspiration may come the most terrible fall.
The hidden world is the trait of Leah, whose eyes are weak. She sits at the crossroads and prays not to fall into the portion of Esau. And because of her greatness and her weeping, she merited to [attain] the foundation of prophecy and sovereignty, and [she gained] the portion of Israel, [whom she married].

Paragraph 251

An individual’s exalted thought strengthens his overall power—the power of [his] body and the power of [his] spirit—so that he may strengthen the power of the entire community.
The greater a person’s thought, good will and clear awareness, the more the community rises, as its material and spiritual powers are strengthened.
Therefore, righteous people must strive a great deal to strengthen all of their powers. When [they do so], they intensify the spread of holiness throughout the world. Then whoever clings to their spirit rises, and the entire world rises with their elevation and with the force of their might.

Paragraph 252

From the aspect of the forcefulness of absolute, imperative Divine Being, there is no place for [us to engage in] any praise and homage [of God], because “anything whose existence is imperative is not [worthy of] being praised” (Maharsha on Bava Batra 16a).
But [our] gaze itself at the greatness of this truth and goodness completes the all beyond “all.”
Then [we] understand that [our] withholding of praise is “higher than all blessing and praise” (Kaddish). [We understand] that the expansion of [God’s] guidance [of the world with His] will is constricted in comparison with [His] absolute transcendence. And it is precisely the diminished [aspect] that provides space for [our] homage and praise.

Paragraph 253

It is not the goal to have the most supernal secret realms of knowledge spread throughout the world in a quantitative sense, so that the masses will know of them. That is something that would be impossible—[and] even if many [people] did know of their external expression, they would [still] not know anything of their inner content, and that would cause more harm than good.
But [these teachings] must penetrate to all those who possess the supernal character of an elevated gaze. And those few, on their high spiritual level, raise the world from its low level simply by means of their existence, not by means of their recognized influence.
They do not, and cannot, reveal the inner secrets. But that which the great illumination causes, in essence, with its blessing, with the spreading of its sparks [so that they rest] even upon all that is revealed, upon the sight of every eye, upon every conversation and movement, upon the character of the will, upon the goal of life, is the activation and encouragement of everything, the strengthening and sanctification of everything.
Similarly, the general purpose of the influence of Israel upon the world is not to propagate views by means of straightforward and revealed [methods] of teaching and influence. Rather, when [our] nation stores well within itself its special quality, the world is already elevated, due to the fact that such a profound special [nation, the nation of Israel,] exists in the treasure house of humanity.
The actions and guidance that the prophets were shown are on a small level compared to the high level of inner activity [in the soul].
Prophecy through a dull lens says, “Many nations will go and they will say, Come, let us go up to the mountain of Hashem, to the house of the God of Jacob, and let Him teach us of His ways and we will go in His paths, because from Zion will come forth Torah and the word of Hashem from Jerusalem” (Isaiah 2:3). This is a summons to an active, recognizable level, which is the second, [lower] level.
[But] the prophecy of the shining lens, that being the Torah of Moses, says, “If you indeed listen to My voice and keep My covenant, you will be to Me a treasure among all of the nations, because Mine is all the earth. And you will be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These are the words that you shall speak to the children of Israel” (Exodus 19:5-6).

Paragraph 254

Every individual—and in particular [every] leader—and the entire populace must possess valor in life.
However, [when a person does possess] this valor, which emerges to appear out of [his] psychological makeup, many harmful aspects [of his psychology] and bad traits are [also] aroused. And [he] requires a clear gaze that is immensely honest to separate the pure goodness from the residue.

Paragraph 255

When [a person’s] soul clings to the knot of life, to the light of Hashem, with a love of clinging to the Divine, all of [his] traits are straightened on their own.
Those great thinkers who are capable of [experiencing an] elevated clinging [to God] straighten the paths of their lives solely by means of the trait of [their] supernal clinging [to God]. That pours through the conduits of [their] revealed knowledge, [their engagement in] Torah and mitzvot, and the entire splendor of [their] ethics and spiritual strength.
The inner demand to cling to the Divine, which comes as a unique unit in the soul of [the people of] Israel, is in itself higher than any logical thought. In accordance with the flow of Divine inspiration, it settles in the heart, and in accordance with the hope for salvation, it strives and spreads across all this-worldly realms that play a role in the life of the community and in the life of the individual.

Paragraph 256

When a thinking person engages in solitary introspection and his inner, spiritual ability is revealed within him, he senses all of the ways in which his soul has been blemished due to [his] improper deeds and traits.
He then experiences an inner and profound sorrow, and he probes into his spirit [in order to discover] how to rectify that which has been distorted.
When that inner sorrow is revealed in all of its might, when [a person’s] external situation grows uncertain, as at a time of damage and trouble, then [his] inner feeling is not so firm. Yet nevertheless even then it can reach its peak, because teshuvah [that arrives] via sufferings is also teshuvah.

Paragraph 257

Righteous people are ceaselessly connected to union with God. They cannot at all imagine for themselves a life absent of the pleasure of clinging to the Divine.
But a great deal of delusory imagination is mixed into every human thought, and this [imagination] is accompanied by a multitude of evil traits, spreading like branches that emerge from a small root or like a profusion of plant life from a single seed.
Therefore, these people must clarify their clinging to the Divine by learning Torah and performing God’s commandments, so that [this clinging] will be entirely clear and holy.

Paragraph 258

The abrasive effects of evil traits mixed into a [righteous] person’s ability to cling to the Divine have an effect more evil than the evil traits of most people. [That is] because there is no activity as powerful in a person’s depth as clinging to the Divine. That is why one cannot imagine the depth and greatness of the life of the righteous, who stand before Hashem and delight in the pleasantness of clinging to and desiring the Divine. [But] when the overall power of life is great and powerful, the evil portion in [that life] is also powerful. [That is] like the inner content of [our Sages’ statement,] “Whoever is greater than another has a greater [evil] inclination” (<i>Succah </i>52a).
Therefore, righteous people are in a constant state of war against the abrasive effects of the evil within themselves, which is mixed together with the good, as long as the world is not [yet] entirely refined.
But Hashem will not abandon them. And they constantly proceed from strength to strength, conquering and vanquishing.
They will never abandon the essential content of life, which is to cling to the Divine. But they will constantly raise it, empower it, and clarify it. And with its ascent and their ascent with it, everything ascends: the entire world, all life, all existence.
With the elevation of the foundation, the building is elevated. And with the strengthening of the root, all of the branches and leaves grow strong, together with the entire multitude of their details.

Paragraph 259

[A person who] calls out in the name of Hashem, Who is one, aspires to reveal [that] oneness in the world: in man, in the nations, and in the entire content of existence, without any schism between deeds and perspectives, between intellect and imagination.
Even the apprehensible schisms will be united by the supernal illumination, which recognizes the aspect of the oneness [of those elements that have been severed] and of [how they may] align.
In the content of a human being’s life, that [unification] is the foundation of all holiness. In the life of the spirit, it is the light of eternity, [which brings together] temporal life and eternal life in a single bond.
That [thought of unifying] is the greatest thought among the giant thoughts in a human being’s power of thought. It is revealed in him as a result of his entire spiritual ability to reveal [matters], [reaching up to] the height of the revelation of the Divine, along the path of the intellect and [with] knowledge that is [direct and] “face to face.”

Paragraph 260

In itself, the trait of the fear of heaven “has nothing of its own at all” (<i>Zohar </i>I, p. 181a), and it cannot be considered among a person’s capacities and personal qualities.
In itself, it is as likely to lower a person and all mankind to the very lowest depths as to raise them to the heavenly heights.
But precisely because “it has nothing of its own,” it receives all of the [spiritual] lights [and] it stores within itself all abilities. And each ability is blessed and assured that it will be guarded only in accordance with the substantial value of its relationship with the great storehouse: the storehouse—in which everything is contained—of the fear of heaven.
Therefore, the fear of heaven rises not so much [as a result of people’s] dealing with its depths as it rises as a result of [people] filling its storehouse with all knowledge and ability, with Torah and with mitzvot, with every proper trait, with all might and strength, with all praise and beauty.
Thus, [taking all this into account,] in itself the fear of heaven and the foundation of its universal existence is in itself a “non-shining lens.” Its entire elevation [comes when] the light of the supernal sun shines upon it, [and ultimately] it will unite well with its foundational source.
Then it will rise ever upwards, and it will truly be “a crown of beauty for those carried in the womb” (<i>Blessing on the New Moon</i>), when it returns filled with good to the [supernal] root of its supernal place [from which it is] hewed, richer than all emanated abundance divided into individual streams, because it is “the daughter of nobles” (<i>Song of Songs </i>7:2), the daughter of our patriarch Abraham, who is called “a noble,” [the daughter] whose name is “in all” (<i>Bava Batra </i>16b), the source of all blessing.

Paragraph 261

It is not always possible to speak [about] essential matters themselves. Therefore, [we] fill the emptiness of thought by speaking about [these] matters’ outer circumstances.
Nevertheless, such conversations too bring benefit, and in the end they lead a person to enter into the essence of [these] matters.
In particular, it is fitting to always speak about the [external] parameters of [these] concealed matters—by way of analogy, geometry, [which describes an object’s physical dimension, but not its intrinsic nature]. And in this way, one soars upward with the intellect.

Paragraph 262

One must explain the elevated [value] of learning the secrets of the Torah [by seeing it in the light of] the quest to appreciate the inner [states of] awareness of the human being, who is the foundation of the world.
As the world’s external culture rises, its internal value falls. Every [such fall] comes from [the following] phenomenon: the greater the progress of the external value of the culture, the more [a person’s] eye appreciates that which is seen externally and disparages that which is appreciated internally. As a result, [appreciation of] the human being’s true value diminishes and descends.
The redemption of the world depends on the elevation of [these] inner appreciations, which come and shine [when a person engages in] a mighty endeavor [to engage with] their depths. [That endeavor] is itself heartfelt engagement with the secrets of the Torah in holiness and purity, with humility and a firm spirit.

Paragraph 263

Purity of the body in all of its practical details and all of its specifics, including immersion of the body [in a mikveh], is very much required to perfect [a person’s] faculty of the imagination in its [proper] place, and to align it with the ethical and intellectual feelings and perspectives that are impressed in the essence of the inner content of the Congregation of Israel on its supernal spiritual level.
And the demand [for that bodily purity] constantly develops in the most elevated of those [people] who [experience] inner [states of] awareness until they [can] only find rest for their spirit when they fulfill [this demand] in all of [its] broadest aspects.

Paragraph 264

[A person’s] deeds are transformed into images [in his mind] via the power of spiritual assimilation, and [those] images to feelings, and [those] feelings to concepts, and [those] concepts to a fixed spiritual character, which affects a [person’s] entire essential character.
From this, one may understand how great is [a person’s] responsibility [to engage in proper] actions.
However, [this] connection is not strong in all [people]. The power of spiritual assimilation is not the same in every person and in every nation. This characteristic lies in the unique mold of Judaism, [in which] the connection among these links of deeds, imagination, feelings, concepts, and overall character is very strong, and the power of spiritual assimilation is elevated.
Therefore, there is no end to the requirement [for the people] of Israel to guard [their] deeds.

Paragraph 265

The standard counsel for simplicity and uprightness—to guard [one’s] good traits and [to keep] every religious [rule] and law—is a matter of the proceedings of the “world of repair.”
Any breaking away from that—whether it comes from the aspect of flippancy and anarchy or whether from the aspect of elevation of the mind and arousal of the supernal spirit—is something of the “world of chaos.”
But [regarding] the world of chaos, there is a great difference between the details of [that world] itself and between its inclinations to the left or to the right.

Paragraph 266

Most people live their spiritual life, and thus also a large portion of [their] practical [life], in accordance with the influence of the imagination.
The work of culture must make its goal to insert into that imagination, as much as possible, intellectual and ethical sparks.
Only those [people] who are elevated and mighty in spirit rise to live an intellectual life, [although] they too are connected in their nature by many shackles to the imprisonment of the imagination, and they must contend with it extensively.

Paragraph 267

The greatest failing in the character of the fear of heaven that is not bound well with the light of Torah is that the fear of sin exchanges places with the fear of thought. And when a person begins to fear thinking, he sinks into a swamp of ignorance, which removes the light of his soul, causes his power to stumble, and coarsens his spirit.

Paragraph 268

Not by thought alone does a person live, but by the character of his soul, which he must guard more than anything else. It is a gift from God, and [a person] guards it specifically with the guarding [given by] God: “Guard My commandments and live” (<i>Proverbs </i>4:4).

Paragraph 269

[A person] must always engage in the general issue of the fear of heaven: to understand its character and to acquire it in its purity as the most precious quality of life. After that, [he must] look in particular at that fear [of heaven] unique to Israel: at what it is and what its independent parameters are.

Paragraph 270

Regarding morality, [a person] must clarify [the nature of] abstract, absolute, universal morality, and he must clarify as well the morality connected to the fear of heaven. And [he must] contemplate the relationship between these separate parameters: how they differ from each other, and how they are united.

Paragraph 271

A person cannot live with intellect alone or with emotion alone. He must always blend intellect with emotion in an aggregate.
If [a person] should want to break forth [in order to rise] higher than his level, he will lose the ability of emotion, and [as a result] he will be filled with flaws and deficiencies, even though he may be very intelligent.
And there is no need to say that if he immerses himself in emotion alone he will fall into the depths of foolishness, which [will] lead to every weakness and every sin.
Only the trait of equilibrium that balances intellect with emotion will rescue him completely.
It is understood that a nation must always invigorate [its] practical character and [its] upright communal sense.

Paragraph 272

A revelation of clear spiritual thought flashes for a moment and immediately disappears into the curriculum of teachings and explanations, which do not at all have the power of supernal strength that [exists] at the point of the revelation in its mighty force at the moment of its birth.
“And those who are wise of heart see the matter at the moment that it is revealed, before it has been clothed. They see it [with] a discerning eye. And although it is immediately sealed, it is not hidden from their eye” (<i>Zohar </i>II 98b). The introduction to <i>Eshel Avraham</i> [an eighteenth-century commentary on the <i>Zohar</i>] [expresses] sensitivity to this wondrous characteristic.

Paragraph 273

They err, those who seek to define Judaism in regard to its soul and its spiritual character, although one may define it in regard to its revealed and perceivable content.
[That is] because in its soul [Judaism] includes everything. And all spiritual inclinations, revealed and hidden, are concealed in it in a supernal totality, just as everything is included in absolute Divinity, and every definition in relation to [Divinity] is a “cutting off of the shoots” and a model of erecting a statue and a molten form for the sake of [presenting] the Divine character.

Paragraph 274

Trembling and fear are characteristics of a person’s psyche when, in whatever way it may occur, [his psyche] encounters an elevated vision. And there is no benefit in warring against [these feelings].
But if, as a result of [his] weakness of thought and the destruction of [his] bodily and psychological powers, they grow too strong, then opposing powers justifiably appear to constrict them, so that they will not be able to damage the soul’s governance of the person and his dominion over himself and over his social circle, with the force that [his] rule attained justifiably.

Paragraph 275

[Regarding] all arguments [based on philosophical] proof related to the ways of faith that are in keeping with logical intellect, even when the forcefulness of [such an] argument has been annulled, [such proofs] at any rate [retain their] value in terms of [their effect on a person’s] power of the imagination, which too must be proper and whole. And the paths of [a person’s] life must align with [his imagination] in its [state of] wholeness.
In particular, we must take into account this power [of the imagination in connection] with Divine matters, because [with] all sorts of [ways of] clinging to the Divine does [faith] give happiness to the individual and to the people: an absolute and eternal happiness. And just as the intellect must be illuminated with Divine illumination, so too the power of the imagination must be illuminated with this illumination on its own level.

Paragraph 276

In order [for us] to [attain] the blossoming of thought and the fruitfulness of literature, it must be agreed that every imaginal and intellectual flower is a fruit of the soul, and [that] when we reveal it, the world grows more refined, [at a time that] soulful aspiration as a whole tends to goodness.
And so [a person’s] intellectual and imaginal power must always be engaged in its work, either by delving into its own images or by being inspired by spiritual visions of other books, both new and old, from which [the person’s] thought is aroused and weaves its visions, all of which rise upon the table of literature to enrich it.

Paragraph 277

Torah and good deeds purify [a person’s character. But he cannot rely on this alone. He must work separately on purifying his character and perfecting [his] ethical being.

Paragraph 278

The word, spoken or written, is never permitted to obstruct the straight intellect.
That is a great principal in the Torah: whether regarding the most exalted perspectives or the slightest details.

Paragraph 279

The moon’s complaint (<i>Chullin</i> 60b) is interpreted well in [terms of] the secrets of the psyche.
Intellect is the great light [of the sun] and feeling is the small [light of the moon]. Both stand in balance, but their ways are different, and sometimes there are very many contradictions between them.
If their value were equal from every aspect, the contradiction [between them] in spiritual life and so also in physical [life] would be great.
[The moon complained to the Holy One, blessed be He,] “It is impossible for two kings—[I and the sun]—to make use of one crown.” [that is to say,] feeling complains [that] intellect can broaden itself to the extent of accepting all opposites, which is not the case with feeling.
There is one counsel for this: [God told the moon,] “Go, diminish yourself.” “Be the head of the foxes.” In the life of action, community, and politesse, [feeling is to] “rule with authority.” But above, in the place of supernal contemplations, the great light [of intellect] rules.
However, the [moon’s] complaint is very great. There are in truth ways in which feeling proceeds in the higher realms and [indeed] in the very highest realms: even in the depths of the intellect and [in] the purity of its judgments.
[This] intellectual power [that exists] in feeling is found in the wealth of details [associated with feeling]: “[God] diminished the moon. Therefore, He gave it hosts of many [stars].” Despite that, [however,] the world is defective because of the descent of feeling from its heavenly heights.
[As a result of this,] the intellect too, with the root of its supernal being, is prevented from proceeding on its [way], and its clarity grows opaque as a result of the diminishment and limitation of feeling and its lack of a constant bond to the light of the intellect.
We [must] bring an atonement for the Divine light having been diminished as a result of the diminishment of the moon. We strive to seek the fulfillment of the flaw of the moon, to place it in balance with the great light, [so that] the felt [life] and intellectual life [will be] equally blended and balanced. How good and how pleasant will the world then be, how pleasing, mighty, exuberant, and holy [will] life [then be]!
“May it be Your will, Hashem our God and the God of our fathers, that the flaw of the moon will be made whole, and it will not suffer any diminishment. And may the light of the moon be like the light of the sun, like the light of the seven days of Creation as it was before its diminishment. As the verse states, ‘God made the two great lights’ (<i>Genesis </i>1:16)” (<i>Blessing on the New Moon</i>).
And just like individual life, so too will communal [life] receive its new, whole, and bright shape.
The most hidden desire in the heights of the intellectual concealment, and that which is revealed in the depths of the heart, in the arrangement of the nation and its might, will stand together, intertwined. And the verse will be realized in us, “Seek Hashem your God and David your king” (<i>Hosea </i>3:5). Amen selah.

Paragraph 280

The Congregation of Israel is called “a wall” in an esoteric sense. That is to say, [it is] a discernable position to which [our] thoughts turn in order to [attain] all of the matters of Judaism and faith.
And [more broadly,] in the general scope of the world, it is [our] recognition of the Divine, which comes from [our] looking at the world and discernable reality, and the revelation of the spirituality that is near [this world], which has an effect on life and ethics.

Paragraph 281

Mankind, in all of the expansion of its might, demands [to retrieve] its [human] image from [inadequate] ethics and religion when these come to block the good and the just within [mankind].
But [in truth] ethics and religion are directed only to block evil and wildness within humanity. And a person profoundly requires the purification of his traits and the illumination of his perspectives [so that he may] understand and apprehend this wild and evil aspect within himself, which religion and ethics must block. And [he must] also know the aspect of light and goodness within himself, which stand above the function of religion and ethics as they are commonly understood.
[Modern] culture reveals many aspects of good and light in a person’s psychology, in an area that had [previously] been thought to be wickedness and wildness. And when, in those points, it finds blockages [created by] religion and ethics, it wars against them and conquers them.
But the end of the war [will be our] revelation that religion and ethics themselves reveal their light until this human freedom, with its natural, good demands, will be recognized as itself being one of the pavilions of religion and ethics.
And the power of religion and ethics will gain greater authority to rule over the wild aspect within man, and [man] will be honored and beloved due to the aspect of the supernal and the good within him.

Paragraph 282

There are two approaches to the value of prayer: the mystical approach and the rationalist approach.
The first—[the mystical approach]—explains [that there is] a connection between the universe and man with all of his movements. It shows patently that the expression of the will of a person’s psyche as he clings to God brings about and creates out of [his] spiritual stance multileveled effects on all existence, and so automatically that effect [acts] for the good in regard to that person’s [individual] portion and his request.
The rationalist approach, [on the other hand,] does not recognize these hidden wonders. [Rather,] it inserts the entirety of prayer into an ethical, psychological, poetic framework. [According to that,] a person is elevated by means of the images of his prayer. His psyche is purified [and] his traits rise.
Certainly, [a person’s] ethical content is intertwined with [his] destiny. With [his] ethical improvement, [his] destiny will improve. [Then] all reality aspires to advance to goodness, [and] wickedness flees from existence. And as that [occurs], we recognize the cause of all of the injuries [caused] by wickedness.
The psychological improvement [in a person that comes about] by means of the emulation in prayer of the poetic: that is the goal.
According to the [rationalist] approach under discussion, [a person] should not connect prayer with the detail of [his] desired outcome. Rather, that [outcome] joins [his prayer] out of the totality [of his prayer].
[Rationalist prayer] recognizes that if a person does not pray, many adverse traits that lack repair and refinement will accumulate within him, and his ethical situation will consequently suffer greatly. Conversely, by means of prayer a person will rise and his spirituality will be more illuminated, and so his desires will be more fulfilled. In general, the idealism of prayer, the expression of the soul, is more precious than the gist of the particular goal that [a person] seeks in [his] prayer.
It may be understood that according to this [rationalist] approach, the ideal situation [in himself] must be more purified for prayer to be recognized as something obligatory that is of great worth.
However, the other, [mystical] approach is filled with an inner idealism woven together with all of existence within itself. But [although it is so exalted], it suffices to draw [people’s] hearts to [establish] its permanence [in their lives].

Paragraph 283

What do I feel when I am summoned to study matters of the spirit? A sickness of the heart and discomfort. Why is this so? Because as that spiritual demand grows stronger within me, my spirit grows especially aware of its moral poverty, and of its spiritual [poverty] in general.
But the spiritual weakness born of this phenomenon is an absolute imperfection, it is a stain upon the soul. One must battle against it with a stalwart heart. The spiritual gaze must be rich, constant and broad, powerful and straightforward.
The weakness and inner pain caused within the spirit by the conflagration of the fear of heaven is in itself an imperfection and sickness. One must acquire clear concepts in this area of holiness, until this uncultured aversion will decrease and be replaced with strength and a broad consciousness.

Paragraph 284

Emotion is incorporated within the intellect. It is the lowest level of [the intellect]. When it emerges to execute practical actions, it establishes its own emotional realm in and of itself, [independent of the intellect].
In all life within worlds, [emotion] is the mystical character of the second letter <i>hey </i>of the [Divine] Name, which in itself becomes the name, “Master.”

Paragraph 285

A person’s prayer and a large portion of [his] activity [related to] ethics and Torah are built upon the foundation of his repairing his emotional [aspect]. They must guard their realm [and remain within the purview of emotion].
If [instead] if we bring to [our] emotion matters and subjects that are [of an] intellectual [nature], we will not succeed.
However, the essence of the demand that emotion should be [included within the realm of the] intellect has its place. [That is] because in truth [emotion] is not a unit in and of itself, but one of the aspects of the intellect, one that is revealed on [the intellect’s] lowest plane.

Paragraph 286

Everything that is called into being in the world, from the earliest generations until the last, [consists] partially of aspirations and partially of recognitions. [And these two] continuously combine into a complete creation.
Until the coming of the form that completes [everything], that implants everything in its [state of] wholeness, these [phenomena] possess [both] good and evil, truth and falsehood, impurity and purity, the holy and the mundane.
But when the light of the inclusive unification will appear, [so] that [the goal] to which all of these aspirations and partial recognitions are coming will be clear, then everything will be recognized as good, as truth, as purity and as holiness: a world that is entirely Sabbath, that is entirely good.

Paragraph 287

A change of atmosphere from cold to hot or from hot to cold in spirituality damages the health of the soul, just as [physical] heat and cold damage the body. And “a person who guards himself will distance himself from this way of the corrupt” (<i>Proverbs </i>22:5).
The soul of a person of Israel must live in an Israelite spiritual atmosphere. He must constantly satiate [his soul] with the goodness hidden in the treasury of life of Israel. If [his soul] will graze in another field, it will grow weak and ill, unless it has every means [it] needs to guard it from every illness. [This is because] it is sensitive to the changes of the spiritual climates.

Paragraph 288

Teshuvah preceded the world. 
Ethics embraces everything.
The absolutely supernal state of being penetrates all of the [branches and] sub-branches [of existence. When a person’s] will is elevated, any deed that had deviated so that it was not aligned with its root returns to its source.

Paragraph 289

Nature does not know [anything] of ethics and justice. Rather, it aspires [to attain] its own desire: to build and to destroy, to decay and to flower. So [too,] the individual nature of a person only knows its own desire.
But holiness spreads. It gains strength due to the influences of a person’s good deeds and learning, the arousal of [his] holy feelings, [and] due to [his] prayer and holy service, until it causes the light of ethics to shine even in his nature.
Similarly, this illumination occurs in all existence. And the pleasant, good light of holiness, of universal ethics, continuously penetrates all existence, until existence with its nature is aligned with the character of ethics and supernal justice within the inclusive, supernal manifestation of the holy.

Paragraph 290

Creative life flows continuously from the Source of life to supernal creation, creating intellect, goodness, and song. It [then] descends level after level until it creates physicality, becoming [something] natural, hard, dark, connected to the law of dust, stone and bronze.
[Then,] on the levels [to] which it has descended, this flow remembers its original light. It yearns to return to the days of its might and radiance. It turns from its low, sunken state and ceases striding ever downward. It turns to rise, to be illuminated by the light from above, by the light of the source of its existence.
It loses its downward development. It turns upward, and so [there is no longer] a process of a continuously descending stream. [Instead,] it is enriched with an inner spiritual wealth. It bonds with the supernal light, [with] a flow that brings about a spiritual, noble, intellectual and ethical, holy and burnished existence.
From [this] exalted bond, many lights and luminosities, wondrous creations, are innovated, in which earthy heaviness [together] with triumphant heavenly aspiration is revealed.
The soul of the human being with all of its various niches is the secret flower of this world.

Paragraph 291

The might of supernal wisdom in the heights of its strength will not emerge to act outside its circle. Its exalted intensity suffices for itself.
But the light of kindness streams upon it to soften its terrible ice, so that it will become a river of currents of cold, fluid waters, from which an abundance of creatures without end will appear.
And wisdom takes on form and is realized in every creature and in every activity.

Paragraph 292

How is [our] soul built? We learn much [Torah], we study, and we return to review [its] ideas. As a result of [our] Torah [learning] and review, we grow accustomed to attaining sensitivity, and afterwards spiritual offshoots blossom from that, imparting a particular character [to our soul].

Paragraph 293

A plant rises with its vegetative power. The cedar and cypress grow with the currents of their powers.
Naturalness lives with a forceful life within itself. [That naturalness] does not know [anything of] a directed goal. It is noble in its spirit. It does not subjugate itself to any elevation. That is the secret of its power and of its wildness.
The soul of the human being lives in the heights of creation. That [soul] directs itself and it looks, it subjugates itself and its might to an elevation of holiness.
[A person] rises with [his] strength, with his wondrous power, to be mighty from within his intrinsic self more than from the powers of life within him [that come] from the world that has no ethical thought and goal. The holy emanation will vanquish everything. “[God] has placed everything under its feet” (<i>Psalms </i>8:17).

Paragraph 294

When [a person’s] understanding rises, it activates [his spiritual] memory. Spiritual elevation conquers time, [and so] forgetfulness—all of whose power is the function of time—has no dominion.
The Platonic conception that all learning is only a matter of remembering is in truth close to the path of faith.
When a person knows the 42-letter [Divine] name and guards it in purity, he retains his Torah learning. As a result of this spiritual elevation, the character of dominance is revealed in [his] psyche, and people are daunted before him.

Paragraph 295

My soul is broad, great and mighty.
I feel my splendor and the glory of my soul within. I am filled with might and freedom. The fearfulness that wraps itself in the garment of fear of heaven cannot lead me astray. I gaze upon the face of the truth, holy grandeur sparks within me.
I must think without constraint. Without no hindrance, I must inscribe paper all the contemplation of my heart.
I do not so much care how these matters will [be expressed], whether in a hidden or a revealed manner. It is all one—in the end, the light will sparkle.

Paragraph 296

That which is in the character of Israel to generate and create: that is the oral Torah.
It is in particular a complete Torah to the degree that it absorbs from the spirit of the written Torah.
It receives its light from the source, [the written] Torah, because the [written] Torah created [the oral Torah] and impressed the seal [of the oral Torah] upon the souls of Israel.
Without the influence of the Torah, Israel has no power of creation. The universal power of creation—which is found in all of the avenues of existence but [only] rests in [the people of Israel]—is not an original power. Rather, it is illuminated and lives from the Source of the noble creation that comes from before the creation. As a finite unit, [the power of creation] receives illumination from its source, and “it has nothing of its own.” It is the light of the moon, which is made whole when it is illuminated in keeping with the level of the sparks of the sun that shine within it.

Paragraph 297

The souls from [the world of] chaos are higher than the souls from [the world of] repair.
The great idealists desire an order that is beautiful and good, substantial and mighty, which has no parallel and basis in the world. Therefore, they destroy whatever is [considered to be] built in the terms of [this] world.
Those [among them] who are elevated also know to build the world that has been destroyed. But [those among them who are] base, who have only been slightly touched by the highest idealistic tendency, simply smash and destroy. And it is they who are rooted in the world of chaos on its lowly level.

Paragraph 298

In the world, there exist gradual development and sudden leaps.  There are soulful people whose character of leaping forward is stronger than their gradual growth.
This is the character of Jews: deeply influenced by the concept of teshuvah, yearning for the most exalted realities.  Their surroundings and conditions may not be in concert with that.  Nevertheless, their powerful yearning is the power that turns the universe, and gives forth the best wealth that may be found within life.

Paragraph 299

When a person wants all of his senses and inner characteristics to be immediately sanctified in accord with a spiritual ascent of awareness [that he has experienced], and [he] also [wants] all of the blemishes in [his] everyday life to be straightened out immediately and perfected with an absolute rectification, he no longer finds a [firm] basis for his spirit and he cannot strengthen his will so that it will stride upon the road of true perfection.
But the all-inclusive crux of the matter is [that a person must] raise [his] awareness [and] intensify the light of the Torah [in his life]. He accompanies [this] with practical teshuvah—at first as it applies to matters that are forward-looking, then to matters of [his] past that [he can] easily rectify, and after that [he] expands the circle [to include] matters whose rectification is difficult. And he proceeds in this way, rising upwards, until he succeeds in rectifying everything.
But [despite the slowness of his progress] he should not allow anything to disrupt him from his spiritual strides, [which must be] in accordance with the inner plane that his soul within him demands he [reach].

Paragraph 300

When the tzaddikim do teshuvah, they cause the light of holiness to shine in all of the darkened pathways. The blemishes that they find within themselves, the counsel that they create for themselves so as to rise from [their] descent and from the despair in their heart to the clear light of supernal holiness and straightness—these themselves become great lights that illuminate the world.
Whoever feels within himself the depth of the consolation of teshuvah and the embitterment of thought [associated with] rectifying his blemishes—both those whose rectification is within his grasp and those whose rectification is not yet within his grasp, regarding which he hopes for [God’s] compassion—binds himself to the company of the righteous, from whose thoughts of teshuvah the entire world is renewed with a new light.

Paragraph 301

For a person who engages in Torah for its own sake, with holiness of thought and with conceptual freedom, [its] details are derived from [its] principles.
Although he is engaged in [learning] the discrete specifics of the details, their smallness does not interpose [between him and] his spiritual character.

Paragraph 302

The creative phenomenon proceeds upon its course. Life devolves [along] its levels. The [Divine] will in existence is increasingly revealed, revelation after revelation.
The quality of good continuously increases, and the Divine illumination propels it to develop.
[However,] the descent of the generation of life with free will, level after level, leads to the revealing of a circle of life with free will that is filled with material and spiritual destruction. The manifestation of the Divine disappears as soon as the angry pollution accompanying destruction appears and nature is stormily pushed away from its powers. Practical existence is alienated from its husband, the Maker, in the midst of the manifestation of the light of life. And that distance has the effort of generating the character of a low, ugly and spoiled existence.
Practical illumination is negated, [and] that generates the concealment of the phenomenon that was already prepared, revealed in the circle of supernal, active existence. That which had been prepared to appear as “good” [now] appears in the role of “the light of good in a vessel,” in the essence of whose depth is concealed a very strong dross, which is raised to the source of its light by a terrific scouring.
The portion of the “ten martyrs killed by the government” is in life.

Paragraph 303

Israel among the nations is comparable to a human being among all of the creatures.
Many creatures have strengths that man does not have. But the overall combination of [his] attributes and the spiritual elevation resulting from them, [making it possible] to understand intellectually how to utilize the powers included within himself, in potential and in actuality—that makes man a supernal entity in the world.
Yes, there are many nations that have a particular talent that is greater than that talent in Israel.
But [the people of] Israel, as the essence of all humanity, gather in themselves the attributes of all of the nations, and [these attributes] unite in them in an ideal, holy form with elevated unity.
“Who is like Your nation Israel, one nation upon the land” (<i>Samuel </i>I 7:23).

Paragraph 304

Foreign thoughts in prayer come because of the general question regarding the topic of prayer [that arises in a person’s mind]: it is apparently inapposite, because we cannot attribute any change of will at all to the Holy One, blessed be He, and particularly as a result of placation and prayer.
And [these foreign thoughts] are removed only in keeping with those answers via which prayer makes sense. Overall, these consist of the following two concepts:
One: prayer is built upon a person’s feelings and not [upon his] intellect. All of the parameters [regarding God and petitionary prayer] and their [resultant] rules, and all of the negative [theology] regarding Divinity come from the aspect of the intellect. [But] prayer is not connected with any of their details.
And two: indeed, the entire relationship between man and his Maker is due to [God’s] decree and a flow of a Divine bringing-into-being. This bringing-into-being decrees that man will [be able] to fulfill all of his functions in regard to the Divine guidance of the world. And one of the important functions is giving place to prayer. Thus, there is indeed a great place for prayer, and it stands at the height of the world.
All of the divisions of the intentions of prayer branch out from these roots. And in accordance with their broadening and deepening, they eliminate foreign thoughts, and they make prayer a pure prayer.

Paragraph 305

One cannot imagine the distress [caused by the] lack of motivation [to attain] goodness and holiness. [A person’s] wisdom is elevated solely in accordance with the blessing of the will-power within it.
Sins prevent [a person’s] motivation from rising. A person must do teshuvah in order to clarify [his] will so that [his] wisdom will be properly elevated.
In particular, [a person] must do teshuvah regarding sins between man and his fellow-man—the most significant being theft, which prevents the elevation of the will.
A person must strengthen himself in this a great deal and hope that, with Hashem sending him salvation, he may fully come “to refrain from oppressing with our hands” [<i>Neilah</i>].

Paragraph 306

There are some righteous people who are not authorized to emerge from [their] clinging to the content of the feelings of their heart, and who do not need to look outside their four cubits.
And there are some who soar upon the breadth of all of the various characteristics [that exist], and they look at heaven and earth and from one end of the world to the other.
And sometimes there is a great righteous person who includes both of these attribute together. Sometimes he does not look outside [his] four cubits, and sometimes his eyes soar [across] everything. “Lift your eyes and see…, north and south, east and west” (<i>Genesis </i>13:14).

Paragraph 307

There is a type of righteous person who needs students who are very great righteous people, world-class geniuses and tremendous in stature. Only then will he actualize that which is hidden in him.
As long as those who receive from him are small, his goodness is hidden within himself, and not even he recognizes it.

Paragraph 308

Sometimes a righteous person does not believe in his own purity and holiness, because he finds flaws and stumbling blocks within himself.
But it is specifically then that his time arrives to rise above all the flaws, because the true trait of a righteous person in whose heart the pleasantness of Hashem is inserted is to rise to his [higher] measure. And all of [his] good deeds and good traits in their supernal root will go on straight ways in accordance with [his] supernal height, which is revealed as a result of the illumination in the world of the great soul of [this] righteous person. Therefore, he is obligated to restore [his] faith to himself: the faith in the Divine spark that lives in him with an inner revelation.

Paragraph 309

And righteous people have a great obligation to constantly engage in studies and songs that arouse the supernal delight, so that they will constantly be suffused with delight. And from their delight a flow of delight will be drawn onto the entire world, onto every aspect of every creature in accordance with what it can receive.
And due to the vast delight that is drawn from the radiance of the holy soul of the supernal righteous person, who possesses clear attainment, a pleasantness of love for all Israel and an inner love for all good will be drawn down. And the lineaments of accusation will be wiped away from all faces, and so insolence will be silenced, and it will be unable to raise [its] head to bewilder the world.
[That is] because the entire power of evil comes from the bitterness that is found in souls because of the aridity in them, and because of their distance from the supernal delight of the blessed clinging to the supernal holiness in the brightness that shines from the light of the Infinite One. And as a result of the extent of the sufferings that every soul endures, evil gains strength in its wrath, and it kicks and destroys. It turns its mind and heart to heresy and to anarchy.
But when Eden develops, a spirit of life returns, “a spirit of grace and supplications” (<i>Zechariah </i>12:10), to hover in [people’s] hearts, and the light of teshuvah increasingly shines, and the entire world is healed.
However, the great righteous person must know his worth, and he must guard his holiness and his inner glory, and not fall due to anything and any matter at all, not even due to any weakness of his own, and not even due to anything that appears by a simple [reading] of matters [to show] that the barrier is great and it cannot be surpassed and one cannot rise into the supernal pleasantness and holy radiance.
And even when it grows clear to him that he is not at all suited for any greatness and for any praise, but he is suited to be lowered and disdained, insulted and lowly without any limit whatsoever, he should nevertheless not abandon his inner character.
And [even] “if the spirit of the ruler rises against you, do not leave your place” (<i>Ecclesiastes </i>1:4).
Ultimately he will be victorious, and everything will be repaired.
And even regarding all of the supernal things the desire for which would appear to be a terrible insolence, in the end his portion will be with them in pleasantness.
“I will bless Hashem Who counseled me, indeed the inheritance pleases me” (cf. <i>Psalms </i>16:6-7).

Paragraph 310

Those with great understanding yearn for spiritual, comprehensive studies. They appreciate the edenic taste of these [studies], and they are sometimes repulsed by practical studies because the tangible and temporal world is of no significance whatsoever for them.
The entire plane of material life and protracted time does not appear to elevated people of the spirit in the same fixed, lengthy form as it appears to [this-]worldly people who are weak in knowledge and poor in spirit.
Eternity: that is the ongoing issue of consequential righteous people. It encompasses their soul and fills their entire being. Therefore, every idea that is worthy of standing in its eternal character, [even as it is expressed] in all of the exchanges of the bringing-into-being of the forms of existence absorbed by the human imagination, draws their heart and refines their spirit.
And also studies that are limited in times and senses: their light that gives delight is only grasped in the mind of those who possess a clear heart to the extent that eternity trickles within them. And so [these people] always yearn for studies in which the eternal character stands with perceptible revelation: and these are the abstract thoughts and absolute images of glory of the high principles in the harmony of their height, which are the principles of the secrets of the Torah and the hidden matters of wisdom in the pleasantness of Hashem.

Paragraph 311

There [have been] periods in an individual’s life and in the life of the nation when practical Judaism has gained strength, in action and in learning, to a high degree. And the reason was the shrouding of the light of feeling and knowledge, as the entire spiritual power of the nation was directed to the practical sector.
And when the obscuring wall is removed and lights of extensive thought begin to appear, and the spiritual life of the nation begins to spread forth on a more extensive and elongated plane, this light [then] dims. And it is liable to return to its light only with a great addition of new light that will suffice to illuminate an extensive plane to the same extent that a light more constricted than it shone on a narrow plane.

Paragraph 312

[A person’s] supernal joy gains strength precisely via a [his] total nullification of the character of his self, because [then his] soul begins to recognize the entire error that exists within an independent character, and [its] desire grows “to cling to the body of the King” (<i>Zohar </i>I 217b) with an infinite wholeness of supernal delight.
And that is the complete humility and profound lowliness in which [a person’s sense of] self is only remnants: that is to say, a matter of deficiency that remains unincorporated into the supernal wholeness.
“A person makes himself like remnants” (<i>Megillah </i>15b).
And this feeling is a feeling unique to Israel, who diminish themselves with every greatness that is given to them.

Paragraph 313

When we ask where depression comes from, we must answer [that it comes] from the influence of evil deeds, traits and perspectives upon the soul—which, with its penetrating sense, tastes their bitterness and recoils, frightened and depressed.
And when the light of teshuvah appears, and when the desire for good asserts itself in its original nature, a channel of delight and joy is opened and the soul partakes from the river of delicacies.
And when [a person’s] practical ability takes for itself the distillation of these pleasant feelings, [then] pure, supernal morality—which imparts success to life with its splendor—comes to light.

Paragraph 314

The thoughts and feelings that come as a result of overall Divine illumination are accepted by the Congregation of Israel to bear fruit and branches and to grow lovely and lasting plants only when they come combined with the independent ideas of the Congregation of Israel itself, of the nature of the nation in its inner character.
The total harmony among these influences comprises levels of the complete unification: the unification of the Holy One, blessed be He, to Whom the eyes of all are turned, and His Shechinah.

Paragraph 315

What do I see in a vision? I see the supernal thought, the thought that encompasses everything, the thought in which the entire force and fullness of everything resides.
I see that all of the great torrents pour forth from it. And from the great torrents come rivers. And from the rivers come streams. And from the streams come freshets. And from the freshets flow rivulets. And these rivulets are also divided into small conduits. And these conduits are divided into a multitude, thousands, tens of thousands, countless tendrils—pouring forth love, life and thought.
Sometimes there is too narrow a space to allow the soul to swim amongst the tendrils. The soul is then grasped by the roots of those fine tendrils: the conduits. And if the conduit too is narrow, the soul is grasped by the rivulet. And if the rivulet is narrow for it, it is grasped by the freshet. And if the freshet is narrow, it is grasped by the stream. And if the stream is narrow, it is grasped by the river.
And if the river constrains it, it is grasped by the divine torrent, filled with water, connected to the boundless thought, the place of broad channels.
In this manner, the lowest trickle, seeping from the tendrils, wells from the prime source of supernal thought, a source so high that the eye grows weary seeking it.
“Hashem has said that He will dwell in the thick cloud.”

Paragraph 316

The essence of the arduousness of comprehension is due to [the fact that a person’s] will for the good and for wholeness is weakened as a result of blemishes of [his] traits and sins. In truth, it [would be] appropriate [for him to] fast in order to debilitate the power of the evil within [his] materiality, which prevents [his] will from rising [along] its gradationsl.
But [a person] must also weigh whether [his] spiritual and bodily power agrees to this. At any rate, he should not despair of an elevation of [his] will. Even when there remain a few blemishes that were not repaired, whether in character traits [or] in deeds, he must anticipate the kindness of Hashem and supernal salvation, because “Hashem is good and upright, and He directs sinners upon the path” (<i>Psalms </i>25:8).

Paragraph 317

The faith of Israel is implanted in the Infinite One, Who is higher than all the substance of faith. Therefore the faith of Israel is actually considered the ideal of faith, the faith of the future, immeasurably higher than the substance of faith at present.
The spiritual form descends many steps along the slope until it is called by the name of “faith of Israel” in [its] essence: in the role of literal faith and not in the role of the faith ideal.
The blemish of heresy pertains to faith itself. But no blemish of heresy reaches the faith ideal at all, [because that] is higher than the concept of heresy, just as it is higher than the concept of faith.
Heresy has no ideal. “‘Another god’ is a eunuch, and does not bear offspring” (<i>Zohar </i>II 103a). Despair and chaos do not give anything.
And so there is no place for an ideal that is the opposite of the ideal of faith, although there is something that is the opposite of and parallel to the body of faith.
The fiftieth gate is the faith ideal, which even for Moses was an ideal, because it was not given to him. It does not exist in the “husk.”
The influence of this fiftieth gate, of the ideal of faith, gives supernal life to all of the gates and subjugates the husk of heresy, which lacks the ideal, [and] which opposes the holiness of faith that is connected to an eternal ideal.
“Because with You is the source of life” (<i>Psalms </i>36:10).

Paragraph 318

Great people are obligated to leap, in order to enter into great thoughts.
A person must recognize his inner talent, and know whether he was made for great things.
He should not be stunned by the sin of pride, by [the fact] that he recognizes the level of his intellect, and the worthiness of the disposition of his will.
On the contrary, he must be much more concerned about counterfeit humility, which depresses the soul, and obscures the Divine light in the spirit.
When the great people rise with an intellectual elevation, the entire world rises with them, in accordance with the feeling [and] in accordance with the shared nature of the spirits of all human beings.
But in a measure greater than all, this nature of participation acts [among the people of] Israel, because they possess absolute oneness from the aspect of [their] soul.

Paragraph 319

[A person] must seek advice against being timorous.
It is only timorousness that brings about the stumbling block of evil opinions and evil traits. [That is] because an evil fear is born in a person, casting weakness upon his mind and inject him with some trepidation, which prevents him from battling against all of the injuries to his spirit and to human society.
A person’s primary obligation is the life of a courageous heart. Indeed, the more that ethics manifests itself in the rectification of traits and deeds, the more will courage be established in his heart.

Paragraph 320

A person of Israel who truly wants to attain the light of life must agree to plant himself in the Congregation of Israel with all of his senses and powers, [both] physical and spiritual: to make the purpose of his life the acquisition, in accordance with his ability, the Israelite traits and knowledge unique to Israel, the chief of all of which is the Torah in all its breadth with all of its branches, and with it everything that is related to the wisdom of Israel. And as a result of the ascent of the Congregation of Israel, he will come to an overall ascent of the source of human and universal life.

Paragraph 321

The rectification of the world that will emerge from the Source of Israel is the ideal of teshuvah.
As long as humanity establishes the behavior of its life in keeping with a rigid measure, it can never emerge from deficiency in [its] intellect, traits and deeds. How [then] will the character of the particular, individual human being be made whole?
All innovations in life and all of the programs that overthrow the arrangements of the world in order to improve it are solely the pathways of teshuvah. And teshuvah must always stand at the height of the highest point of the ladder of human completion.
The individual human being as well as all entire society must always repair himself, heal his spiritual and practical fractures. And heaven forbid that habit be the principal factor in the management of life, individual and overall.
Therefore, we learn that rebellion and heresy, which calls on abandoning the good inherited from the forefathers for the sake of some new vision of the heart is an idea of teshuvah that makes waves.
And when we distill it to its depth, we find that the aspect of good within it is the general kernel of returning from all lowliness and from all damage that is dependent on it. And from that we come as well to return from the great damage that exists in the destruction itself. And then we return to Hashem in truth, and redemption comes to the world.

Paragraph 322

The kingdom of heaven is the “ark of the covenant of the Master of all the earth” (<i>Joshua </i>3:11). That phenomenon in which the Divine ideal is sufficiently manifest to subjugate people’s aspirations so that these will not burst forth out of the boundary of the good goal of goodness, uprightness and straightness—although it does not suffice to raise souls so much that their independent character will be solely the universal, absolute good—that measure is the kingdom of heaven. It presents the image of Divinity as Master, [before Whom a person’s] subjugation leads [him] to do His will, even against the will of [that] individual.
But this illumination [receives] its life [force] from the manifestation of a more supernal measure, which comes from the absolute wholeness of Divinity in its fullness. That is the manifestation of the totality of the Divine light in its supernal measure, by means of which [a person’s] spiritual form does not receive only the form of the spirit vanquished before the Divine content with the manifestation of the [Divine] will, but [the person’s spirit] aligns everything solely with the Divine desire, which is recognized via the inner being of the idea of vanquishing. That [idea of vanquishing] corresponds to this [inner] measure like a container for a scroll placed in it, the “ark of the covenant.”

Paragraph 323

The Congregation of Israel reveals, in each changing era, one of the many forms of its multitudinous lights. And the [messianic] future [of the Congregation of Israel] will be the absolute spreading forth of all [these] lights, each of which had served for a specific period. In that [future], they will all shine together, simultaneously [in the Congregation of Israel]. And with this overall harmony, [the Congregation of Israel] will shine upon the face of the earth.
Not only does [the Congregation of Israel] include its manifestations within itself, which had been revealed through it in different eras, [the Congregation of Israel] includes within itself as well the manifestations that had been revealed in other nations because of [the Congregation of Israel]—whether as an immediate cause or as a distant cause, whether as a revealed manifestation or as a hidden manifestation.
As for the entire [fact that the world] is separate from [the Congregation of Israel] and opposed to it, this only appears to be the case because [the world] is detached from the source of [the Congregation of Israel’s] entirety. But when everything will return to appear in [the Congregation of Israel] as one, [the Congregation of Israel’s] independent content will be recognized: that everything accords and correlates within it.
And all of the prophets will sing in one voice, as in the verse, “The voice of Your watchmen: they raised a voice, together they will sing, because eye to eye they will see when Hashem returns to Zion” (<i>Isaiah </i>52:8).

Paragraph 324

In the Divine world, there is no will and constitution different from any other will and constitution. Rather, everything turns to the total good, which is whole in every way. Every manifestation that we focus on is not partial, but universal. Although we intend to look upon manifestations, each one of which is higher than its fellow, each one includes the all.
But in the measure of life that is said to be not Divine, we can find partial manifestations, which are different wills and insights, detached from each other.
“And from there, [the river from Eden] divided” (<i>Genesis </i>2:10).

Paragraph 325

It is impossible for a person to detach himself from clinging to the Divine, and it is impossible for the Congregation of Israel to detach itself from the Rock of its salvation, the light of Hashem, the God of Israel.
But this impossibility, which manifests itself in all generations, is by its nature compulsory. It does not allow for clarity of mind [that would] reveal how [this clinging] functions.
Therefore, days will come in which slumber will fall upon humanity and the forms [of the Torah and the people of Israel] will be sawn apart, until a complete detachment will become possible. And [then,] with the cessation of slumber, instead of the bond of a natural connection that is back-to-back, the harmonious beauty of humanity will stand in the totality of its glory, when free will of the intellect will have the knowledge to say: “This time, it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh” (<i>Genesis </i>2:23). And the world will stand firm with a manifestation of life and generations lasting forever.
The ability to orate about apostasy, about heresy, about absolute [spiritual] detachments—these being the outcome of the sawing apart, which will lead to the total, ideal, liberated unification, “like the bridegroom rejoicing over the bride, so will your God rejoice over you” (<i>Lecha Dodi</i>, siddur)—[this is a] vision revealed in the relationship of the Torah to the nation: that the natural bond [between them] is detached by means of the sawing apart that occurs during slumber, and the completion of the sawing apart is the constitution of a structure that leads to a bettered [state of their] unity. And [then] the Torah [will] return to those who learn it: “all of your children will learn of Hashem, with vast peace for your children” (<i>Isaiah</i> 54:13).

Paragraph 326

Every great soul is involved with all of the branches that spread out from its roots, and it must repair their blemishes. It has the purity to draw close those who are far, even more than justice would deem appropriate, when it recognizes that they have a relationship with it.
In this last generation, the “heels of the messiah,” there are righteous people who recognize that there exist absolute heretics, people who entice and ensnare, who are related to the source of their own soul. And so they must engage in the rectification [of those people] in truly exceptional ways that are completely impossible for revealed rationality to conceive of.

Paragraph 327

The heretic who has no connection with the Divine truly lacks a human form, and his goal is not to live a human life at all.
All of his feelings are only animalistic. Even if he is a person filled with knowledge and wisdom, and evidently filled with ethics and uprightness, he is only like a trained and cultivated animal. But the human spirit in the entire depth of its existence is breathed [into a person] only [when he has] a connection to the supernal Divine.
The more human knowledge matures, the more absolute heresy diminishes and the more its force declines. Therefore, there are many heretics who are heretics as measured by halachah, but when we know how to examine their person, we will find in them a connection to the Divine content in a hidden form.
For this reason, there is a truly vast tendency in our generation to [find] merit in and [extend] kindness to even these absolute heretics.

Paragraph 328

The root of heresy is an absolute credulity: the belief that the large and staggering miracle [of the creation of the universe was] gratuitous and pointless.
The creation of the world and its guidance by the Creator of all with wisdom: that is something understood and exceedingly straightforward. All of the difficulty in theology is in the details: how to convey to the intellect the topic of the Divine and the connection between [the Divine] and all of the worlds. But the essence of the matter—that an entity of wisdom and observation, ability and kindness, rules over all creation—there is no place to deny that. The contrary [applies to] the decision to imagine in the heart a kind of faith that all existence, filled with so much exactitude and wisdom, is something made without intent. That [would be] something so miraculous that the intellect would not even begin [to consider it] possible.
And the rupturing of the intellect against its will from that which is of greatest interest to a person leads to a number of other such ruptures, which also afflict the heart.
And this foolishness pertains as well to the [topic of the] eternality of life, to the knowledge of the faith of the immortality of the spirit, and the relationship between [a person’s] good conduct of life with wisdom and justice [resulting in] the absolute happiness of [his] soul and the denigrating of this conduct.
[Our] intellect [teaches] that [what a person] accustoms [himself] in terms of the practical and the imaginal grants spiritual strength to [his] spirit in [the world of] eternity, corresponding to its [greater] model [of the miracle of creation].

Paragraph 329

The force of holiness is the intensification of a person’s yearning for the Divine and [the intensification] of the spiritual light in [his] will and nature until [his] desire for holiness and the Divine goal are more deeply [immersed] in [his] spirit than all [of his] natural inclinations.
When a person attains the supernal level where [his] desire for the Divine is so great that with its holiness it even controls [his] sexual drive, he is a righteous person who “guards the covenant.”
And this control comes not in the way of uprooting [his] spiritual and bodily nature, but in [his] rising toward [his] intellect’s goal, which is illuminated by the Divine light.

Paragraph 330

The soul in its oneness must perform all of [a person’s] activities, intellectual and material. Since it is limited in accordance with the conditions of its creation, when it tends to one action, it takes its mind away from another action. The material and the intellectual are a balanced scale for it, and it always exercises its power to expand its influence and the expanse of its sphere, so that it will stand in such a position that all of [its] actions will turn to one goal. Then it will be able to prevail over all of its works without war and without interruption.
Everything rises and develops. Souls too develop and attain to such a degree that [a person’s] perusal can encompass the spiritual and the materiality with no contradiction. And then [the souls] will perform their work with the ultimate wholeness and enliven [people’s] bodies with their great might, which is drawn from the Source, the Life of worlds. “And you shall know that I am Hashem when I open your graves, My nation” (<i>Ezekiel </i>37:13).

Paragraph 331

The clear idea [that comes from] pristine thought correlates the simple and the revealed with the deep and the concealed, and natural things with that which is higher than nature: in the world and in man, in intellect and in ethics.
Natural ethics can devolve from the light of the imprint [of holiness impressed into the world]. That light [comes] straight [down from above,] yet it is mundane in comparison to the [manifest] holy.

Paragraph 332

Great righteous people who yearn for the holiness of supernal beings may interrupt their learning halachah to engage in the secrets of the Torah, or [to engage] in clinging [to God via] conceptualizing with [their] intellect or [employing their] imagination [regarding] Divinity, “because that is the entirety of a human being” (<i>Ecclesiastes </i>12:13).

Paragraph 333

When the aspiration of the intellect follows the initial depth and rootedness in the depths of faith, it has an elevated, living and health-giving, constructive and illuminating character.
[But] when it leaps over [to come prior to] the recognitions that [should] precede it, then it itself becomes sickly, and it cannot fulfill its task.

Paragraph 334

The essence of faith is [faith] in the greatness of the wholeness of the Infinite One: that everything that enters into the heart [regarding that greatness] is [merely] a spark and entirely nullified in comparison to that which a person should imagine [of His greatness]. And that which a person should imagine is not even something that rises to the level of being nullified in comparison to what [the wholeness of the Infinite One] actually is.
And if the heart’s awareness is torn away from its source, then it is impoverished and worthless. And the only way it can be rectified so that it will shine in a living form is by a connection with the illumination of faith, which is a general illumination, higher than all [particular] values. And with that it provides a base for all values.
All matters of faith that are outside [faith regarding] the greatness of the Infinite One are only explanations via which to reach the essence of faith.
[These] explanations are in the category of the “limbs of the king,” and some of them are in the category of the “garments of the king.” And “the person who tears the garments of the king raises a hand [in rebellion and] deserves death.”
At any rate, we must gradually clarify the differences between the essence of faith and its explanations, and we must also clarify the different levels among the explanations.

Paragraph 335

Matters that are enduring and inclusive are built in accordance with [a person’s] eternal, complete and whole aspirations. And they are found only in holiness, which is faith: i.e., a living inquiry into Divine matters.

Paragraph 336

When [we] learn the secrets [of the Torah] with no explanation but with a good and faithful heart, that is like rains descending via the clouds—and “a day of rain is as harsh as the day of judgment” (<i>Ta’anit </i>8b).
But afterwards, great is the abundance of blessing that emerges from that. “The sun of righteousness” (<i>Malachi </i>3:20) shines [with] “the sweetness of the produce of the sun and the sweetness of the yield of the moon” (<i>Deuteronomy </i>33:14).

Paragraph 337

That which is understood regarding the descent of the [spiritual] worlds that results from [people’s] sins—that is to say, [a descent that affects] the part of life that a person grasps in all of existence, which the mystical terminology calls “the blemish of the worlds”—is [that it] corresponds to the root of [a person’s] soul.
And of course [this] overall connection [between the individual and the cosmos] is very broad. And the inner quality of the level of morality [in the universe] is in keeping with effect of the determination of good and evil [caused by the person’s actions] upon the totality of existence.

Paragraph 338

I see how sins stand as a barrier before the bright, Divine light that shines in its great radiance upon every soul.
[Sins] darken and cloud the soul.
Teshuvah—indeed, even when it is a mere thought—brings about a great salvation. However, the soul only attains complete redemption when it brings potential teshuvah into actuality.
At any rate, since the idea [of teshuvah] is connected to holiness and to the desire [for] teshuvah, there is nothing to fear at all. It is certain that Hashem, be He blessed, will provide all of the pathways through which complete teshuvah, which illuminates all types of darkness with the light of its life, is acquired.
And in accordance with the great value of teshuvah, so is the Torah blessed and clarified more fully.
[A person’s] learning becomes lucid and clear. “A broken and oppressed heart, God will not despise” (Psalms 51:19).

Paragraph 339

Sins are the essence of melancholy. When the soul is purified, it feels the force of [a person’s] sins. Then the melancholy of teshuvah overwhelms [the soul], and there burns within it the fire of the suffering of remorse, shame and terrible fear.
With this itself, [the soul] is purified. And it can, after the agitation has subsided, return to its vigor and stand in its might and essential glory.

Paragraph 340

The inward suffering of teshuvah comprises significant material for singers of melancholy to arouse their harp and for those who depict tragedy to reveal their talent.

Paragraph 341

Every Torah sage—in particular, from among those engaged in the secrets of the Torah—possesses an illumination of Moses, and similarly an illumination of Rabbi Akiva.
The ministering angels seek to push all of these [sages] away. [But] the Holy One, blessed be He, helps [each such person], and addresses [the angels], “Leave this elder alone, [because] he is worthy of making use of My glory” (<i>Chagigah </i>15b). And [the term] “elder” refers to a person who has acquired wisdom (<i>Kiddushin </i>32b).
[But] at the time that the ministering angels are pushing [him] away, all of [his] powers of the spirit shrink, and the insult is exceedingly great.
[This] person raises his eyes to heaven and places his trust only in the God of truth—“there is no other than He” (<i>Deuteronomy </i>4:33)—Who created everything for His glory.
Then a new spirit enters into him, [his] heart is filled with courage, and all become his friends.

Paragraph 342

Nature and free will exist everywhere. In the spiritual realm, [this pairing] corresponds to “front” and “back.” Nature is the “back” of free will.

Paragraph 343

Every wisdom and every spiritual phenomenon in the world possesses a positive aspect and a negative aspect.
The positive aspect gives that phenomenon its entire form and its expansiveness. And the negative aspect does not allow any other phenomenon to expand in its place.
The more [a person’s] knowledge grows, the more the positive aspect intensifies and the negative aspect weakens, until in the heights of spirituality there is no negative aspect at all, because the pure supernal knowledge guides and prepares a place for every expansion of the manifestation of the existence of the good. And [that knowledge,] with its positive nature causes everything to grow.
[But] as [a person’s] comprehension is obscured, the negative aspect is exceedingly revealed, and [his] eye grows jaundiced, and it cannot tolerate any phenomenon that appears foreign to it.
But this jaundiced eye brings pressure to bear upon this phenomenon itself as well, which seeks to grow more broad, until in the end the [person’s] awareness rises and leaps over its narrow straits, so that it will broaden properly. And [his awareness] will then state, “All that Hashem does is for His sake” (<i>Proverbs </i>16:4).

Paragraph 344

Each thought of the heart has its place.
When we pray, we are in a state in which the phenomenon of life relates to us via a sort of conduit connected to the expression of the will to improve [our] situation.
And sometimes we rise, [so that] the world appears to us in all its loveliness, everything good and fine. And then we praise instead of pray.
Every thought of the heart has its own spiritual realm, upon which we impress the seal of a particular name. And secrets of the world appear from each realm in keeping with its level.
When we are in a regular state of being, there are elevated thoughts that are absolutely hidden from us, and we say that they are hidden—that is to say, they are hidden in terms of our regular spiritual state of being. Yet nevertheless, a spirit of holiness manifests itself on us afterwards, and [then] we speak about these enigmas as well.
Such a difference of states between the regular and the elevated exists as well [between] the manifestation of a spirit of holiness and the illumination of prophecy on all of its levels, and the supernal manifestation in which that which is overall the enigma of regular manifestation [of such a holy state] is explained.

Paragraph 345

When evil traits rule over a person, his mindfulness grows smaller, and a smallness of mind itself leads to evil traits.

Paragraph 346

Supernal holiness is filled with love, kindness and patience, because it is so suffused with perfection.
Hatred, judgmentalism and severity are the consequences of forgetting Hashem and the oppression of the light of holiness.

Paragraph 347

The brilliance of faith unites with wisdom.
[But] when a person capable of binding together faith from its deep origin with wisdom slackens in his acts of [mystical] unifications, a terrible suffering aggregates in his soul, until he will return in the greatness of his might with the power of teshuvah to bind the tent[together], and to illuminate wisdom and faith together from the light of their origin.

Paragraph 348

The thirst for knowledge wears out the person whose soul is filled with light. [So] he must strive to slake [his] thirst to rescue [his] soul from its suffering.
Of course, he must choose the purest water, appropriate to the level of [his] pure soul: i.e., [he must] engage [in learning] the purest and most elevated perspectives.

Paragraph 349

The thirst of the soul yearning for its overall, [human] wholeness is slaked with every spiritual illumination that comes to it. But the unique thirst of the Israelite wholeness that seeks [to fulfill] its role is only slaked through the bastion of the Torah.

Paragraph 350

The inner pain that comes because [a person’s] soul lacks perfection in deeds, in knowledge, in concepts, and particularly in acquiring Torah, constitutes the intensifying pangs of Gehennom.
[These come upon a person] when the Holy One, blessed be He, turns His face aside and does not shine upon [his] soul with a constant manifestation.
That corresponds to the degree that [the person’s] soul has reduced its spiritual wealth upon which the entire source of life depends: the acquisition of Torah knowledge.

Paragraph 351

We must always start from the beginning, from the initial thoughts of childhood, in order to clarify them and purify them, and to elicit the good and the light in them, with purity and courage.
We should not disparage simple thoughts. They stand by us to illuminate our path more than any of the thoughts that we imagine to be high and exalted.

Paragraph 352

In a few philosophers, the “husk” (<i>kelippah</i>)<i> </i>of the blind mole in all its shades has been revealed. And those with a holy heart must recognize it in order to vanquish it.

Paragraph 353

The righteous do not fall from their holiness due to any sin, because they are constantly connected to the world of teshuvah. And even in interpersonal sins that are difficult to repair in actuality—such as a stolen object that no longer exists, and the like—they do not stop belonging to the category of the completely righteous, even if they have not yet actually made reparation due to of some weakness and obstacle, because ultimately their heart is [directed] to heaven, and they are connected to the true good.

Paragraph 354

The inner pull to the absolute good distinguishes the character of the thoughtful righteous person who lives in the world of [Godly] emanation and purity.
He feels any slightest blemish in the purity of [his] deeds and traits via the test of feeling difficulty in being drawn to the Divine good in his spirit and [experiencing] terrible pain in his heart, since he is sick with love.

Paragraph 355

Every sin [which a person commits] deprives him of the peace of mind necessary for the illumination of the secrets of the world, but Teshuva opens the doors of understanding, in that it itself stems from Understanding.
Teshuvah opens the doorways of understanding, just as [teshuvah] comes about by means of understanding.

Paragraph 356

[A person] can profoundly rectify [his] mis spent sexuality by sanctifying [his] will and illuminating it clearly, until the light of holiness will stream through even [his] strongest physical drive. That drive is rooted in holiness that is incredibly strong, because it contains the expression of life: the sexual drive. The light of holiness will stream within it to such a degree that its holy aspect will rule [a person’s] life and direct its action and expression. Then sexuality's secular aspect, and certainly its unclean aspect, will be totally nullified before its holy aspect. Then, in truth, the plague will not enter [a person’s] tent; [he] shall be righteous and guarded from stumbling.
When [a person’s] will rises to that supernal level of holiness, it is cleared of all bad traits and all bad actions that exist in the world—even of the most inconsequential matters that most people disregard.

Paragraph 357

[A person] might desire illicit relations more than life itself, because sexual relations are embedded in one’s drive to give life to all generations. But through sexual holiness, [he] can rise to the level and archetype of the righteous man of all generations.
Second to that, [a person might experience] the desire to steal, because what one possesses can support generations to come as an inheritance. The love of evil acquisition exceedingly degrades one’s care for future generations. But the goodness within holiness can rise to the heights and summit of life.

Paragraph 358

What is to blame for the terrible depression that prevails in the world? Sins, in deed and in thought.
When a person is removed from his nature—his physical nature or his spiritual nature—he exists in a ruinous inner state. The pangs of Sheol flood over him.
The crux [of dealing with] this is spiritual integrity.
When [a person’s] viewpoints gain integrity, [his] deeds also strive to gain integrity, [his] life perceives its wonderful worth, and the joy of integrity fills [his] entire soul.

Paragraph 359

We see that the tendency to gross physicality, to make it alone the crux of everything, brings a person into a net of dark depression, until there is no escape. And why all of this? Because it seals the lights, [with] the sources of life within them, and it chokes the soul in its coarse atmosphere.

Paragraph 360

A person must acquire, [one,] simple natural morality in all of its breadth and depth, and [two,] the fear of Hashem, the pure distillation of simple faith, and all of the traits [of faith] in breadth and in depth. And upon these two qualities he will build all of the levels of his supernal spirit.

Paragraph 361

All that we can comprehend with intellect is by way of analogy.
But our inner awareness digests [these] analogies with an inner digestion and clarifies the distillate that will enliven our spiritual being.
These “digestions” proceed step by step, gradually, [so that] a coarse analogy rises to one that is more refined and precise.
This is comparable to chewing with the teeth, which is the beginning of digestion, and then the concept is honed to a purer state, comparable to the grinding of the molars, and afterwards [comes] the level of the help of the tongue, [followed by] the digestion of the upper stomach, and then onward and onward, until the manifestation of the spirit of life of the purest intellectual and moral qualities—[all] activated by the power of the “eating.”

Paragraph 362

In the individual and in the community, pure and blurred ideas mix together, poured into each other.
When some piece of knowledge grows clear, a ferment immediately begins in all of the pieces of knowledge, and the heart begins to beat with the topics of the clarified pieces of knowledge until the mind grows settled, and the new, clear piece of knowledge unites properly with the other pieces of knowledge, and the light of peace arrives.

Paragraph 363

The Rambam observed that [a person should] be joyful [when he gains] an added piece of knowledge in negative theology. And he should know that the knower rises in stature to closeness to God as a result of the addition of [this] negative knowledge.
[The Rambam] found that his observation was necessary, because the heart is not happy with negativity, but sad.
[That is because] all joy comes from positive [factors], which add [to a person’s] acquisition of existence, which is an inner wealth. And every lack of acquisition brings sadness in nature.
But when a person rises to this trait of unification with the light of truth until all truth brings him wealth, and [even] negative truth brings him joy, that is a very supernal measure, by means of which everything negative is transformed to positive, and every such lack is considered an absolute acquisition.
It is true that, in order to increase the joy of knowing God in the world, in order to make this exalted acquisition a popular acquisition, we must transform the measure: to come to know God specifically by means of positive images. And [these] positive images will, still and all, [express] ultimate truth no less than, and even more than, the negative images.
The gist of the matter is that, just as we may properly judge and say that a wealth of descriptions and examples about God’s being are nullified, since in the context of [His] infinite wholeness they are miniscule and as nothing, narrow and limited, so [too] we may say that regarding every topic [of] non-being—that which does not exist in the law of the Divine wholeness and all limited descriptions or descriptions of those things that are imperfect when they are by themselves—their imperfection is due to their detachment, their isolation. But in the Divine wholeness of the One Who is omnipotent and gathers them together, everything rises.
That being the case, [the fact] that we need to make negative [statements of the Divine] is only the limitation and detachment in a description [of God], these [limitations] being in essence that which is lacking [in these descriptions], which lead to sadness.
But the description, from the aspect of the essence of the good within it, rises upward to enrich our knowledge of the Divine.
And with that, all hearts can come close to know Hashem in a spirit of joy that rests upon the happiness of the wealth and multitude of acquisitions—“with joy and a good heart out of an abundance of everything” (cf. <i>Deuteronomy </i>28:47).

Paragraph 364

Free will, illuminated by the supernal intellect, is the distillation of existence, revealed in the inner being [of existence].
And that is the soul of Adam in all its fullness.

Paragraph 365

Every transgression and sin sullies the holy.
The smallness of [a person’s] will that comes as a result of a blemish in [his] traits and that is strengthened by [his] sin chokes [his] holy soul, so that it cannot breathe its holy air.
[The person’s] love becomes sickly and miniscule, until all things dependent on it grasp only its smallness.
And when [people] speak of the unique quality of the nation [of Israel] in its spirituality and its loftiness, the words are interpreted, due to [his] personal weakness, as flattery, and not [as coming] from the aspect of their elevated truth.
Therefore, the beginning of [this person’s] obligation is courage of the spirit and elevation of thought until [he] clarifies matters in such a way that that which is elevated will remain elevated intrinsically, and [he will] be drawn to [Israel’s] greatness with the greatness of truth.

Paragraph 366

We grasp an image of the greatness of man, an image that concentrates existence on the existence of man, on his essential greatness and on the aspiration of his courageous and holy will.
The body and its powers are the entire earthly distillation, and the spirit and its abilities are the entire heavenly distillation. The ultimate truth shines, the hidden truth, which is clear to all eyes of [people with] a clear soul.
The elevation of the body and of the spirit is the elevation of a central part [of existence], by means of whose elevations everything that surrounds it rises. [The central part] acts as the cause [of existence], it always flows and influences its being.
This exaltedness must be understood in an understanding that is very free of every errant imagination. Then it will be a source of the might of the spirit and the happiness of the person in all of his attributes.

Paragraph 367

When we envision life as a period of the growth of the spirit that ripens day by day when we attend to it properly—and this attention [consists of] good will and good deeds, good learning and traits—until the ripening of the spirit will be completed in all of its fullness, when it no longer needs the flesh (just as the well-ripened apple does not need the tree), the riddle of life and death will be explained well, and the mind will grow at ease, and it will be rectified to receive supernal views and elevated feelings from the holy heights.

Paragraph 368

When a person’s fear [of God] is not properly purified, it turns him into a rag, cowardly and ashamed of himself, and thus assailed as well by every meager lust.
Therefore [a person] must be specifically “wily in fear” (<i>Berachot </i>17a) in order to purify [his fear of God].

Paragraph 369

When a small thought occupies space in [a person’s] spirit regarding Divinity and all holy topics, it spreads the poison of its smallness across the entire multitude of [his] deeds, learning and statements, which develop in accordance with its influence. [Then] spiritual dregs, shadows, thoughts of falsehood and weakness, flattery and lust take hold of all matters of holiness and gather for themselves a place in Torah [learned] not for its own sake and in commandments [performed] for the sake of vain flattery.
And the holy person, whose holy sense cannot bear such upside down affairs, finds terrible weariness within himself when he approaches his unpurified work.
And although sometimes it is necessary not to wait for the completion of the elevation of the spirit [before doing one’s work] despite the worry that [one’s] learning and activity in its exterior form will suffer terribly from absolute impoverishment, nevertheless, there is always place for this reckoning [and making the decision to wait, with an] inner shame that clothes a person in his knowledge that the supernal holy spirit does not yet rest upon him, and it is not [that holy spirit] that presses him to work and to act, to learn and to keep.
[Then] out of [his] yearning for true holiness, he will clarify his tendencies, until he will always stride from level to level on the level of the holiness of the spirit. And always the clean, supernal aspect will be aroused in him more and more, [so that he will] take the fundamental and principal part in his tendencies to act, to learn and to teach, to guard and to perform all of the words of the learning and the mitzvah of Hashem with love. And the love will be refined, supernal, strong, holy and shining.

Paragraph 370

The entire world is filled with harmony. A unifying resonance permeates all of the chambers of reality and its crevices.
The inner [sense] of ethics and its powerful claims are drawn forth from the united echoing voice of all parts of being, all of which interpenetrate.
A person’s spirit is entirely filled with them all and united with them all.
Every severance from ethics in idea and deed, in character and disposition, brings into being disparate entities, which cause many inward sufferings to all parts of the soul. The basis of these sufferings of the spirit is the trembling brought about when the light of life of the universal order of all being is removed from the conduits that bring life to the sinful soul.
The purer the soul is, the more sensitive it is to the trembling of its pains—until it can silence its pain with the stream of the life of teshuvah, which pours forth from the supernal source. [That teshuvah] mends all of the rents. It causes a dew of life to trickle down, [a life] that proceeds directly from all the avenues of existence. Each [part of existence] interacts with each other [part], including the parts of the soul as [the soul] returns to its supernal revival, with [God’s] great compassion and with universal joy.

Paragraph 371

A consciousness that is universal, inclusive and shining leads to a oneness of ethics in the world. And with that, the root of the fear of sin rises until it is a universal, inclusive concept, which is the basis for fear of heaven. [And that] provides the basis for the foundation of deep love, [which is] the quality of supernal wholeness.
Ethics branches and grows particularized in keeping with a person’s understanding and learning, in keeping with his portion and his resolutions. And the stronger [this] foundation is, by means of which ethics divides, the stronger is the form in which it exercises an influence, the relationship between the connected actions and the overall character of ethics.
And from this it emerges that all ethics that is bound together with proclaiming the name of heaven wells more and more from the depths of all existence and penetrates to the depths of the soul of the soul.
That is the secret of the trembling of faith and its elevation to the mighty heights [of] exalted joy and love.

Paragraph 372

When [a person] learns Torah for its own sake, he is doing a kindness to the entire Congregation of Israel.
How is that? The spirit of the Jewish people is strengthened when its children gain their spiritual sustenance from the fruits of that spirit.
The entirety of the Torah is filled with the spirit of Israel. Every individual who is engaged in learning Torah unveils a new power of life in the soul of Israel as a result of the spiritual food that he receives from the Torah. The more that this learning is illumined and crowned with a broad awareness and good understanding, and the more that it gives a person generosity and a pure spirit, the more does the power of Jewish life reveal itself and give the Jewish people the power and joy of life that enable them to be encouraged and rise.
But the source of all weaknesses in the spirit of the Jewish people that enter the world is the forgetting of the Torah and the neglect of learning Torah.

Paragraph 373

A separating, [horizontal] screen must be placed between one world and another, because without separation the great light in the upper world would blur all of the details of the lower world.
For instance: learning the precise details of the Torah and the precise details of the Scribes with the greatest meticulousness is incorporated into a single torch, with the overall goal of [establishing] the foundation of [our] religion, of aspiring toward holiness, and [of attaining] the elevation within [that holiness].
And if in truth the gleaming light of the details would be blurred, the entire practical world would be destroyed.
Therefore, the screen must be spread. It permits the clarification of every detail in a world that is dark compared to the overall illumination. And this work of clarification, with knowledge and service, improves life.
Above the screen, the light shines in the entire glory of its extensiveness, and on the path of its passage it sprinkles drops of illumination on every particular node, until the lower world draws sustenance from the upper [world], and increasingly they unite.

Paragraph 374

[A person’s] knowledge that the human being [contains] the central contents of all existence expands [his sense of] ethical responsibility and arouses [his] desire to accomplish great things.
If [our knowledge of] the universal, material form has grown as a result of the many [recent] discoveries, [that means that] science places before us untrammeled dominion as human beings.
And [this] revelation is [that man] is the most supernal distilled center of existence: because certainly life is the distillation of insensate existence, and the distillation of life is command [of one’s] passion, which reaches the apex of its power via its unity with the absolute good and its actualized manifestation in the most possible form.

Paragraph 375

Sometimes we begin from imaginative depiction and matters [rise] to the purest intellect and [even] higher than the intellect and its roots.
Divine happiness fills all of the vitality of all of the roots of the soul: in man and in the world.
And sometimes the beginning comes from a manifestation that is intellectual, or even higher, and it spreads [down] to the imaginative depiction and all of its feeling-bodily branches.
And sometimes the two influences meet each other in their holy current. And then the person is a ladder upon which the angels of God ascend and descend. And the strings of [his] soul are the harp. And the going back and forth of the streams produces the sweetness of their voice [upon the strings], a mighty voice. “His palate is sweet, and he is altogether desirable” (<i>Song of Songs </i>5:16).

Paragraph 376

When [we] enter into the depths of awareness, [we] see that the commandments are not merely symbolic elements leading [us] to remember and impress some matter on [our] imagination. Rather, they are elements that bring about human and universal existence.
Nevertheless, the symbolism remains part of [the realm of] activities. [That is] because, for the sake of the construction of the individual [soul] and the overall soul, [we] must rectify [the soul’s] imaginative depictions just as we must rectify its contents, its traits, and its intellectual depictions.
Specifically those perspectives whose basis is the set practical commandments rise upwards, are refined, and interconnect when [a person] performs and learns them.
And specifically, based on how [the commandments] are kept, [we] can develop man and the world to such a degree that there is no [longer any] need to add impressions [to the imagination], because [those impressions] have already completed their work.
But then, with the coming of the phase in the [messianic] future when the commandments will be nullified (<i>Nidah </i>61b), everyone will see the inner content of all of the commandments: [a content] that fills the world and fills each soul. And [these contents] are the commandments themselves.
But an interruption of alacrity in keeping [the commandments] while the world is still so entangled and clouded only increases the entanglement and necessitates a longer period of time for the healing of all infirmities.

Paragraph 377

[A person] should not be at all confounded if, after the passage of a long era of the activity of [the people of] Israel that has influenced them and the world, thoughts of heresy return to spread across the world. If so, “What has the righteous person accomplished?” (cf. <i>Psalms </i>11:3).
[The answer is] that the crucial rectification of the world is not identified in what the expressions of the mouth and the words of the lips. The essence of [this] matter depends on the force of the improvement of life and the inner being of souls—in man and in life that spreads across the fullness of everything. In that regard, one cannot imagine how much the world has developed, and how much truth, justice, and uprightness exist in the midst of the essence of the life of souls—more so than in previous days, when the light of Hashem had no effect on the world.
[This] inner being is the knowledge of Hashem and the light of Hashem, even when it is embodied in a garment of heresy.
When the inner being of the world was corrupted and murky, that [heresy, an] outer “husk” of faith, was truly impure in relation to supernal holiness. [That husk] suckled from a number of evil illusions and abhorrent desires.
[And now] the more the world improves—although the husk of heresy at times stretches across [people’s] perspectives—solely because purity hates the murkiness of debased faith, which has suckled from the source of wickedness, even though that [debased faith] also has a root in supernal holiness.
But in the very innermost being, great is [a person’s] yearning for the Divine, pure source, which is the foundation of faith in God. And [great is] all the light of Torah in the entirety of its glory, which will burst forth in the flow of its purity and acquire atonement for the sin of the scab of heresy spread out across the face of the purity of wonderful faith.
And then the glory of the highest faith, which comes from a spirit filled with might, will appear. The dead will arise and dry bones, a great army, will stand upon their feet. And from [these troops] will be heard the voice of Hashem in strength, the voice of Hashem in glory, with holy sweetness and with the sound of a great roar, like the roaring of the waves of the sea.

Paragraph 378

Sin prevents the revelation of wisdom, because it blemishes the will. And the essence of the manifestation of wisdom exists in the depths of the will.

Paragraph 379

When we speak about the topic of God without knowledge and depth, the soul stands before a vision of desolation that occludes the heart and darkens the light of life.

Paragraph 380

Praying and [learning] Torah aloud and with clear pronunciation elevates the powers of life to the height of the hidden spirituality, and blemished traits are rectified by [that prayer and Torah learning].

Paragraph 381

When we learn and perform the commandments, holiness gathers in the soul like a treasure of life. And afterwards, when we think about matters of holiness and faith and how to view [all] worlds, we find [our] spirit prepared and [our] heart intrepid, in keeping with the level of the possession of the Torah and the commandment that the person has acquired for himself with his deed and with the purity of his intent, and with his diligence.

Paragraph 382

As long as a person loves spurious honor, his eye cannot truly see Hashem’s light.

Paragraph 383

From barley, [which is] animal feed, comes the <i>omer</i>.
When the animal spirit rises to its supernal source, and with its mighty strength it tends to holiness and true purity, [then] the powerful, Divine love celebrates its holy holiday [of Passover].
And as the entire nation offers up its material powers—which spread throughout its entirety—to be holy to Hashem, its will unites with the will of the eternal God, Hashem.
[Then] a covenant of love together with the consolidation of the [Divine] dispositions upon the path of life in the process of God’s guidance of the world ([which is] perfect in its holy height) and on the path of the entirely sanctified nation is established as a result of this holy activity [of the nation].
And eternal love is established between Hashem and Israel, the nation close to Him.

Paragraph 384

A fundamental principle that comes from essential concepts is that the commandments are not symbolic entities, such as mnemonic devices. Rather, they are ethical actions that the Divine compass has drawn. And at any rate, they possess a great breadth [that encompasses] all the symbolic beauty.
An appreciation of the principle of the animal power shared by man and animal—which is contained in the character of the barley that is incorporated into the <i>omer</i>, as it rises to the altar as an offering with the intent [of those offering it] that all [being] will bend [its] will to the aspect of the elevated and holy—creates a positive, tremendous ferment in all souls, and in all of the aspects of life and existence that have a relationship with [souls].

Paragraph 385

The morality in [a person] cries out within him: “Human being, turn back from your sins!”
Sometimes [this] outcry is so tumultuous that it disrupts the entire harmony of [his] life. [This] person is forced to rise to spiritual levels that are [ordinarily] higher than [those] he [has achieved], in order to provide a basis for the structure of his inner world.
But here courage must come to [his] aid.
A person’s inner courage must stand up on his behalf at the time of the most bitter failure of [his] spirit.
[This is] because the mighty power of a person’s [inner] moral demand often bewilders him and renders him incapable of extracting himself from his shackles.
[His] bad traits and characteristics [and his] bad deeds that have abandoned the way of Torah and morality oppress him.
He sees that his path is covered by brambles. There is no way out to [gain] rectification.
He is deposited into the hands of other [forces], and there is no [way for him to take a] stand.
But from all of these [forces], the light of the sun of righteousness will shine forth.

Paragraph 386

[A person] must begin with purity of deed, and afterwards purify [his] emotion and [his] character, and rise from that to purify [his] mind. And in that way, matters proceed step by step. Fortunate is the person who merits that.
However, it sometimes happens that a person cannot rectify [himself] step by step. He [then] may not look toward [doing things in] order. Instead, [he must] grasp everything that comes [to hand]. And when his spirit is ready to elevate [his] perspectives, he will rise and be purified, he will expand, he will “make the Torah great and glorious” (<i>Isaiah </i>42:21).
[That is the case] although the demands on him because of the content of [his] emotions and deeds that have not yet been rectified and clarified have multiplied. And even if [these unrectified matters] should be of the most serious [kind], which are matters between man and man, he should nevertheless not stop his ascent and his activity for [the sake of] good and for elevation in all that his hand [can] grasp, even if he may be held back—from whatever aspect it may be, whether from the aspect of a lack of ability, or whether even from the aspect of a lack of will (because it sometimes happens that a lack of will is similar to being overwhelmed).
Heaven forbid [we] use the excuse [given by] the heretics [that they lack] free will, which is a corrupt perspective. Nevertheless, sometimes purifications [do emerge] from that perspective, which heal dire diseases of the spirit. This is due to the principle [contained in the passage stating that] of “if not for three verses [that mitigate a person’s responsibility], the feet of the people of Israel would collapse [because they could not be forgiven]” (<i>Berachot </i>32a).
And the principle is that a person in keeping with the extent of his comprehension and yearning for the growth of the good [must] expand and broaden his deed[s] and not be dismayed and not fear any obstacle, neither spiritual nor material. And when we encourage ourselves and fill ourselves with resolve, the might of supernal holiness begins to pulse within [our] soul and cause all of [our soul’s] ways to succeed.

Paragraph 387

Sometimes a person’s thirst for God grows so strong that [it rises] above the boundary of all of [his] vessels and all of his spiritual powers, until the structure of [his] personal behavior is damaged. And [then] sin has a great effect in diminishing the manifestation of the Divine illumination, and it damages [his] soul’s ability to contain the descending radiance so that it will be distributed properly to all its streams.
And a person must strengthen himself a very great deal and hold strong in faith in the supernal, infinite, and immeasurable kindness, without end and dimension. And his mind will begin to transform the thirst that weakens and depresses [him] to a thirst that arouses [him] to delight in Hashem in the light of the Torah, wisdom and the commandments.

Paragraph 388

When we learn Torah for the right reasons, we draw from [God’s] Will the elevated goal of the Torah, which spreads into every detail. Then a supernal kindness increases for the person learning and for the entire world with him.
But when we learn for incorrect reasons, then the particular manifestations [of spirituality] are revealed [only] to the discrete particulars, and the wisdom contained in them is constricted. Corresponding to that measure of wisdom, God’s Will is curt, and with short temper and anger. And it would have been better for a person [who learns in that manner] never to have entered this world.

Paragraph 389

Torah sages are like fish that cannot separate from the water: so too they cannot separate from the Torah.
And when they separate from the Torah, they immediately feel within themselves a tendency to every sort of spiritual darkness, and a terrifying arousal of evil.
And the higher the level of the Torah sage, the more he cannot separate himself from the level of his Torah [learning], until the great righteous people, the level of whose spirit and soul is great, cannot separate from clinging to the Divine and from [engaging in] spiritual unifications.
And when they need to engage in the revealed Torah and in the practical commandments and in affairs of the world and the society of human beings, even in a way of mitzvah and holiness, they must prepare shields for themselves so that they will not be harmed when they dislodge themselves from their natural height, which is the connection with the knot of life, with Hashem their God.

Paragraph 390

The prophecy of the Torah, [which is] the prophecy of the “clear lens,” reflects upon the source from which supernal justice and ethics emerge.
When [that prophecy] finds [the source expressing itself] in the practical mitzvot—which, in keeping with their Divine constitution, pour the character of the holiness of absolute justice onto existence in general and [onto] the person who performs them—[then the prophecy] places as the central element the Divine mitzvah, the [sacrificial] service and keeping [the mitzvot]. And [so] the sacrificial offerings stand at a supernal height as a source of education for clinging to the Divine, from which good deeds emerge.
[On the other hand,] prophetic prophecy, that of the “unclear lens,” does not gaze to the source but to its practical branches. Therefore, it elevates practical ethics, justice and judgment above [Torah] law and the [sacrificial] service. “Behold, hearing is better than an offering” (<i>Samuel </i>1 15:22).
In truth, when the clear lens conveys some manifestation, even [one that is] weak, from its great light, [then] the shadows that cover the brightness of the manifestation of the root turn away, and the purity of clinging to the Divine is formed from the character of the [sacrificial] service and the mitzvot [in general], and afterwards comes ethics as a requisite result of its supernal cause.
But when [the clear lens] hides, gloom intensifies, and explanations from the coarse imagination come and destroy the entire brightness of the [sacrificial] service, until the holy spirit is required to purify the concepts, and it says: “If I am hungry, I will not tell you, because Mine is the world and its fullness. Do I eat the flesh of oxen and do I drink the blood of goats?” (<i>Psalms </i>50:12-13).
[The holy spirit] returns afterwards to the root and says: “Offer your confession as an offering to God and pay your vows to the Supernal One. Call out to Me on a day of trouble; when I free you, honor Me” (ibid. 14-15).
At last, [the holy spirit] presents the seal of its refined compromise, which encompasses the spirit of peace between the clear lens and the unclear lens: the principle that unites prophecy with the Torah. “A person who offers a thanksgiving offering honors Me. As he forges his path, I will show him the salvation of God” (ibid. 23).

Paragraph 391

It is a demand of falsehood to request that the soul [experience] true clinging to the Divine without the elevated greatness of learning the depths of the Torah’s secrets.
If a person has already approached the antechamber, when he distances himself from it even for a short time, he is trapped in the net of [the case of a person] “who learned and [then] separated himself, [which is the most severe condition of all]” (<i>Pesachim </i>49b), even though he learns other Torah topics, and how much more when his heart beguiles him to cease [learning] Torah altogether, for whatever reason it may be.

Paragraph 392

A person should not stop [learning] Torah and serving [God] and tranquility of [his] spirit for any reason in the world, even when his heart embitters him a great deal in matters of spirituality, [so that] he thinks in his mind that he is a sinner who cannot be repaired, heaven forbid.
Even if his failures have been many in matters between man and man, for which teshuvah does not grant atonement without repairing [what he] distorted, at any rate he should go on his way in serving [God] and [learning] Torah, and with joy and goodness of the heart.

Paragraph 393

There is a great difficulty in envisioning the concept of Divinity and [Divinity’s] relationship to the world and to all created beings, when [one] envisions Divine existence [as being] outside the existence of the world. Then it appears as though God has achieved some success in that He, being [intrinsically] necessary, is the happiest of all, [whereas] all created beings are lacking because they are frustrated in [their desire to] succeed in being like God.
And therefore [a person’s] spirit prefers to envision an encompassing oneness, a vision that recognizes only Divinity and knows as well that every particular revelation is not Divinity, but [that Divinity is] the all, and the source of the all, and that which is ever higher than that.
But, [in this view,] this division between particular revelation [of details] and Divinity is not inherently true but is caused by our eyes’ blindness, [because] we only recognize the particular [details]. And we ourselves: our [own] particular existence with its failings is a blindness of the eyes.
But this view as well does not fit with all the other conditions for [human] happiness that are hidden in the concealments of the heart.
That which does settle the mind is the principle of happiness [found] in freedom, [in] complete free rightness.
Absolute, free goodness that tends in its freedom to the good is a necessary existent. And every individual can rise in the essence of his freedom to the source of good desire. When he will want the absolute good, [then] “he will cling to the body of the King” (Zohar 2 217b), and there will be no differentiation between him and his God, “because [it was] your sins [that] separated you from your God” (<i>Isaiah </i>59:2).
We repeat, therefore, that the true existence is Divinity, and all existence lower than the level of supernal God is only a descent of the will in its imperfect choosing, which causes an addition of lowliness.
And ultimately all of the pollution will cease, and the will, in its freedom, will rise to the absolute good, and “Hashem will be one and His name will be one.” And this existence of the return of everything to Divinity is the supernal wholeness in existence, and no power [can] comprehend its worth.

Paragraph 394

As the world grows more fragrant, its inner being rises.
A person finds his inner desire improving, [even as] the purification of [his] outer being diminishes.
[When a person] recognizes this, many types of ferment come that touch upon great areas [of life] holding firm the spiritual state in the past, and giving them a new form that, although apparently destructive, in truth it only builds.

Paragraph 395

When great righteous people fear the mundane excessively, they fall from their position. And they find their ascent when they encourage themselves to take the mundane and all of its facts, affairs and thoughts, and raise it entirely in supernal holiness.

Paragraph 396

The work of the supernal righteous people is to extend their will and to expand it, to strengthen it and embolden it. And the more their will is actualized, the stronger and bolder it is, the more durable is the entire world and filled with illumination.
“With increase of the righteous, the nation rejoices” (<i>Proverbs </i>29:2).

Paragraph 397

Just as Moses’ prophecy is exceptional because of the brightness of its shining lens, so that the body and its capabilities are not nullified, similarly, in keeping with the amount of supernal light shining in [a person’s] spirit, [his] human intellect and living human emotions are not nullified.

Paragraph 398

Fallen faiths bring heresy, so that [a person] will be purified of [those fallen faiths].
[That heresy] scours with its causticness all of the defilement in [a person’s fallen] faith, even as it assaults pure faith, with the goal of scouring it to purity and making it like purified gold.

Paragraph 399

[A person] capable of comprehensive understanding must [use his] intellect in all [of his] service [of God].
The root of faith and its branches, the mitzvot and all their details, their stance in the past and in the present: he must review everything with [his] understanding.
[If] he allows himself to fall into a slumber of dull emotion, he [will] find his spiritual powers greatly weakened. He must empower himself and strengthen himself with strength of the mind because the soul, which is rooted in the mind, cannot rest upon a basis of emotion that is bound only to imagination.

Paragraph 400

The moment that a person with a great soul performs a mitzvah, his soul asks him: What is the purpose of [this] mitzvah? How does it act for the good? In what way it is possible to connect it with the mind and with feeling?
[It] does not accept the answer, “This is Hashem’s will,” as the final explanation, because this explanation is [itself] the subject of endless explanations. And the joy of the mitzvah will always be found on the level of reason and knowledge that [the person] will find in the mitzvah.
And the same applies to every [type of Torah] learning, to every halachah, to every [case of] lengthy [Torah] matters that branch out. [A person] must see how everything draws [its] sustenance from the essence of its root. He cannot know [of] another way, and he cannot walk upon it.
The person with a great soul is alone, and many are his sufferings: sufferings of inner aloneness.

Paragraph 401

The sufferings that the person with a great soul endures because of the necessity to engage in small details, whether in learning or in activity, are healed only in the deep and broad thought that every small detail is a product of an entire unit, that every phenomenon reveals an entire world within itself and causes endless worlds to shake. And the more this truth penetrates into the heart, the more do all of the particular matters become precious, and in everything we see Godly sparks, radiances of universal shards that are rebuilt with a perfection that takes the heart.

Paragraph 402

From where can the cheerfulness of the heart emerge if not from the recognition of the absolute goodness, the Divine goodness? A person might be concerned that he will endure sufferings forever, that there is such a state of existence that will grasp [him] so that he will not break free, forever and ever, that will torment [him] forever.
A confidence [that abrogates] this worry is possible only when [a person trusts in] the Divine goodness.

Paragraph 403

Inuring the heart against the topic of the Divine until [one reaches] the tawdry state of heresy destroys the soul and the world, in two ways.
[One,] the false view that the world is mindless, chaotic and soulless, and that [its] entire construction, filled with wisdom, kindness and beauty, is random activity makes all truth rebel against it.
And [two,] bending [one’s] desire away from connection in [one’s] thought to the Divine character, which is so lovely, beautiful and kind, causes all of [a person’s] integrity and refinement to rebel, until [his] ugly difficulty [with faith] and [his] inner languishing shiver throughout [his] soul and the world.

Paragraph 404

Paganism, claim [its] proponents who tend to lead [people] astray, is strong in emphasizing impressions of life, in expressing details, in [its] penetration into beauty and multi-colored richness—[whereas, they say,] the Divine Oneness blurs everything, it turns all colors into a single color, [so that] the richness of life grows impoverished. This claim [comes] from a lack of knowledge and a dullness of feeling.
Paganism, with its powerful stimulation, has already made its impression to corrupt life, [with its] demand for richness of colors and for the accentuation of impressions.
Because of that [and to counter that], the Divine Oneness, with [its] definition as oneness, surpasses the regular view of oneness.
And it truly surpasses oneness to the same extent that it surpasses multiplicity. And the richness of multiplicity is always in it in a form that is infinitely more bright than it is in paganism, which is shattered and disjointed.
The oneness that gives life to multiplicity, that absorbs the multiplicity into itself, and that surpasses all existence and rises above all content, certainly does not diminish the impressions of life but increases them by means of a flow of strength and the greatness of the oneness into the multiplicity. And each of the sparks of multiplicity possesses a blessing of infinite greatness.
Kabbalah comes to complete the picture and show how all the beauty of Japhet is essentially taken from the tents of Shem, except that the picture has been blurred, due to [Japhet’s] distance.
And the kabbalah speaks with an extensive breadth of explanation [about] the world of Divine oneness, [about] all of the richness of [each] individual color, which is revealed as a result of the manifestation of the Divine oneness, as it is revealed to human beings in their mind and in their feeling.
Zealots rise and say about this true wisdom that gives life to every beautiful soul, “It is an alien child. There is an image of mythology here.” And these censorious people do not know that every spark of warm light and life in paganism is taken and drawn from the foundation of the holiness of the oneness.
And in order to understand the oneness, to feel it with all its richness, the oneness and its source, the revelation of its existence and its strength, we are called upon to speak about the concepts of oneness in relation to the manifestation of the multiplicity.
And the oneness-multiplicity is the richest multiplicity of all, the multiplicity of the one that is prior to one: that is to say, the wholeness of the multiplicity in the glory of the beauty of the Divine oneness.

Paragraph 405

The fear of punishment, the lowly trait in the contour of spiritual ethics, is also the supernal trait when it is ideal.
How is that? A person recognizes [his] sin as ugly, and [its] ugliness as foul to [his] spirit and foul to existence.
And that foulness causes [him] a very powerful spiritual suffering.
And corresponding to the size of the light in [his] soul, the stain of the sin appears and arrests [his soul’s] beautiful harmony with existence, with its loveliness and beauty, with its honor and its holiness. And [then] the fear of sin comes [to the person].

Paragraph 406

Paganism cannot feel the ugliness of sin.
The scattered sparks, separated, each one to its [corner], to its [own] profit—despite all of the possibility to emphasize the beauty of each [spark] in itself because of the parts arranged in a fitting and esthetic order within [each spark] and in its orbit—lack the eternal harmony epitomizing all existence, external and internal, as one complete totality, that gathers together the movements of life, physical and spiritual, with all the glory of existence into one enclosure and connects each part to its companion with an absolute connection of the beauty of the Life of worlds.
A spirit of impurity and absolute evil is bound with paganism. “Murder and adultery” (<i>Jeremiah </i>7:9), “turning to other gods” (<i>Deuteronomy </i>31:20) crowd each other.
The beauty of truth is the harmony itself, the magnificence of oneness in its preciousness.

Paragraph 407

Heresy cannot attain the strength for which it yearns. A person is filled with rage because he is so weak, and nothing can help [him].
The expansion of boundaries, a person’s rising to the root of his soul and recognizing, with great strength and might, the soul as “a portion of God above,” restores his strength.
His rising to the heights of Godliness depends on his will. Ultimately, that [rising] is promised to everyone. And from [that] assured end, a person rises and strives at all times and [in all] seasons.

Paragraph 408

We speak of the branch of knowledge about the soul: in psychology, from the aspect of song and poetry when one looks at the inner being of [the soul’s] depths; [and] in science, from the aspect of [the soul’s] manifestations in revealed life.
So too we speak of the emanation of Divinity as the soul of existence: from the aspect of the poetic outlook of the holy spirit, in the inner light; and from the aspect of the Divine science, with the manifestations of structures, deeds and visions in the vessels.
And [just as] the soul rises above the laws of psychology that are being revealed, [so too] the Divine emanation transcends creation.

Paragraph 409

The insolence in the era preceding the messiah is due to the rarefication of the world and the bursting forth of light that is on the cusp of arriving [but] has not yet attained its character in full.
The recognition of Divinity bursts forth like a channel of water, and every idea jostles [every other] idea.
Even as [human] intelligence has a firm idea of a zenith, a great flow comes immediately that reveals the smallness of [that] previous zenith. And before [this] second brightness is acclimated in the soul, another wave of new light comes.
And because this flow is so swift, the eye does not see [it], and the image is transformed into some node of negativity—until the vessels [will be] repaired, and the Divine light [will be] in order, in spirit and in deed.

Paragraph 410

There are great people the transit of whose spirit is so elevated that from their standpoint, if the entire world were on their level, the commandments would be nullified, as will be the case in the future (<i>Niddah </i>61b): the days of the messiah or the resurrection of the dead. [But] nevertheless, they are tremendously connected to the commandments—not for their own sake but for the sake of the entire world that is connected to themselves.
When they come to engage in the details in themselves [alone], they find such great personal contradictions [in themselves] that they melt away in their vast grief.
[But] when they come to [learn] Torah and [perform] the commandments in detail for the sake of the world, an incomparable wellspring of might and holiness flows onto them.

Paragraph 411

It is only possible to attain humility as a result of truly clinging to the Holy One, blessed be He.
When a person is capable of truly clinging [to Him], it is fitting that he wear tefillin a good deal. Then he will truly be filled with humility.

Paragraph 412

When the great person brings himself too fully into the measure of details, whether in learning them or trembling before them, he shrinks and his stature is diminished. [Then] he must do teshuvah out of love, out of greatness of the soul, in order to connect the content of the life of his soul to great and exalted matters.
[At the same time,] he must of course not denigrate any detail, heaven forbid, and he should as well always increase [his] vigor and practical holiness.
The great soul’s feeling is deep, and its ethical sense is sharp and pierces to the depth. And if illumination, which delights and gladdens [a person by giving him] an overall perspective, will not come to remove the threat of the trembling [caused by] the endless details, he will necessarily melt away in the grief of his trembling, and as a result of that [grief], he [will] have no Torah, prayer, and supernal concepts, which are the most precious of all.

Paragraph 413

Those [people] who say that they seek theoretical images [with which] to understand the world, [images] that have no humility, [doing so] in order that mankind will be filled with might—as a result of which [these people] come to heresy—commit a moral error. That [is because] without humility a person will not withstand his evil tendencies, which consume his spiritual strength [when] they arise in him.
It is specifically as a result of humility before Hashem, which is the source of the totality of holiness and good, that evil is subjugated and pure ethics can emerge from potential to actual.
Indeed, if a person has already genuinely purified his entire essence until he has no admixtures of evil, then in Hashem’s greatness he [will] find only greatness and preciousness, and a type of fear that [will] crown him with honor and glory, and broaden his soul—[a fear] that has no model in the powers of the [human] spirit without the influence of supernal, Divine holiness.

Paragraph 414

Our experiencing the sufferings of the straits of Sheol—resulting from bad deeds and bad traits, a lack of Torah due to not engaging in Torah [learning], and the pain of being unable to cling to the Divine—these are all a refining fire that purifies the soul. And [as a result of] these [sufferings], a person may look forward to salvation.

Paragraph 415

A person’s evil inclination is crushed in his core only through the details [of his engaging in] Torah and ethics.
And [his] good inclination is strengthened through the overall phenomena that [appear] after his soul has been purified [because he has] incinerated the dregs within it.

Paragraph 416

Miracles clarify Divine faith, which is above all boundaries, and through this holy faithfulness Divine wholeness is fixed in the soul (nefesh). When emunah entirely completes its task, bringing the soul (neshama) to light, then faith in miracles and the remembrance of them will no longer be necessary to selfhood. But the wholeness of emunah, in its lofty holiness, only comes through establishing an active, faithful, connection to miracles. The Exodus from Egypt, and the miracles bound up with it, is their foundation which will continue to last until the days of the messiah. Then the Exodus will no longer be the essential foundation, but rather a secondary element or even something which has already served its whole purpose. “…They shall no longer say, "As the Lord lives, Who brought up the children of Israel from the land of Egypt," But, "As the Lord lives, Who brought up and Who brought the seed of the house of Israel from the northland and from all the lands where I have driven them, and they shall dwell on their land." (Jeremiah 23:7-8) The messianic light will restore the supernal brilliance of humanity to its might, and it will be higher than any Divine revelation which has been until now, and even the Torah of this world will be as insubstantial vapor in comparison to the Torah of messiah. The supernal brilliance of primordial man draws the dew of its sacred and joyous life from the present, it does not require the past. It draws from the depths of consciousness and life, not from memory.
When faith will completely conclude its role of bringing the soul forth to light, [the soul] will no longer need the essence of faith in miracles and their remembrance.
However, [until then,] faith in its holy loftiness is perfected [when a person] establishes the link between faith and actual miracles.
The Exodus from Egypt, with its associated miracles, is the foundation [of subsequent miracles]. The Exodus from Egypt will extend until the days of the messiah, when it will no longer be a fundamental principle (<i>Berachot </i>12b), but either secondary or something that has played its role entirely. “And it will no longer be said, ‘By the life of Hashem Who raised Israel from the land of Egypt, but ‘By the life of Hashem Who raised and Who brought the children of Israel from the northern land and from all of the lands to which I scattered them, and they will dwell on their land’” (<i>Jeremiah </i>23:7-8).
The messianic light will restore the supernal illumination of the human being to its might. Therefore, it will transcend all Divine revelation heretofore, until even the Torah in this world will be a [mere] breath compared to the Torah of the messiah (<i>Kohelet Rabbah </i>11:12).
Adam’s supernal illumination draws the dew of the life of its holiness and happiness from the present, and does not depend on the past—[it draws] from the depth of knowledge and life, and not from memory.

Paragraph 417

The great righteous people are filled with love.
It is not suitable that their great love should be fulfilled by everything, because everything in the world is small compared to their faculty for love, and nothing can fill their love but the Divine.
[But] they love all things in the world because all [things] derive from the Divine light.

Paragraph 418

When the spirit of holiness that emerges from the Congregation of Israel rests on a person, he sees with his [own] eyes how the entire oral Torah with all its details branches forth from the root of the entire nation’s spirit of holiness.
And all of these together—the details and the details of the details—display in the fullness of life and light [the nation’s] soul in the entire fullness of its stature.
And due to the great love revealed in [this person’s] soul for the entire nation and the entire distinctiveness of its soul, [his] pure, constant, supernal love spreads to the entire oral Torah. And [this] love causes the [person’s] recognition of [its] details to blaze, and enhances [his] ability to infer one matter from another with true understanding. And from that [love], [his] affection in its supernal holiness returns to the written Torah at the height of its beauty.
And both of these—[the written Torah and the oral Torah]—shine together with brilliant hues, acting as the root and branches of the nation’s soul.

Paragraph 419

[A person’s] spiritual perception is filled with a clarity that comes from a comprehensive memory: the memory of the greatness of the [Jewish] nation and the entire fullness of its glory in the past. And similarly, [his spiritual perception] is affected [when he] improves [his] hope for the future.
These two manifestations improve the entire spirit. And from that comes the great affection for the commandments dependent on the Land and on the Sanctuary, and all of the feelings that depend on them.

Paragraph 420

The encompassing, spiritual, inner revelation in the depths of the Jewish soul sets before us the inner form of all of the practical Torah: a form that is ideal, and which contains all the practical Torah's details.
The entire sweep of the oral Torah with its tributaries flowing as one is the life of the Jewish nation, as it flows from a supernal source, united as a solid element.
From the impression left by this soulful revelation, we come to a more exalted uplifting.  We increasingly rise, and the supernal levels of the holy spirit continue to be revealed.
All this is in accordance with our diligence in learning Torah, performing good deeds and elevating our character, and the illumination that comes from clinging to God in a spirit of supernal consciousness.

Paragraph 421

The trait of the <i>nefesh</i> shines in women. Therefore, impressions of holiness are permanent in them. And it suffices that they vitalize [these impressions] by means of the relatively few commandments in their hand. Nor do they need the constant revival of the spirit [that comes] from learning Torah.
The <i>ruach</i> shines in men. It proceeds without interrupting its spiritual movements. [Men] are very much prone to descents, just as they are prone to ascents, and they need the revival of the spirit [that comes] from [learning] Torah.
Indeed, when they set aside times to [learn] Torah, they bolster their stormy spirit, supporting it so that it will not falter.
All of this refers to the trait of the majority of men. But masters of the soul are like a flowing river that does not cease for a moment from being renewed eternally. They must be immersed in the light of Torah without any interruption whatsoever.
They are like fish in the sea, all of which are in water and do not emerge to the dry land at all.
Of these men, it is said: “Whoever sets aside times for Torah violates Torah” (<i>Jer. Berachot</i>, end of ch. 9).
Their constant, unceasing Torah may either be Torah of the mouth—that which is revealed in speech—or Torah of thought—an intellectual clinging [to holiness] that constantly rises.

Paragraph 422

Regarding humanity as a whole, one may speak of a failing in character only in terms of [humanity] relative to other creatures. [That is] because the world has not yet risen to the height of experiencing an [inherent] moral sense.
But regarding the unique [Jewish] nation, it is relevant to speak of a moral failing, [which appears] when its evil component gains strength.
The aspect of the dross in the Congregation of Israel is immense and acrid, commensurate with the magnitude of the power of the nation for good, as [in our Sages’ statement,] “Whoever is greater than his fellow, his [evil] inclination is greater than his” (<i>Sukkah </i>52a). And the exile refines all that dross.

Paragraph 423

Instances of comprehension proceed on a path of manifestation and work.
That is to say, a sudden manifestation shines light on familiar contents. Sometimes a single manifestation shines forth entire worlds. And after that comes the time of the work: to clarify the details contained in the manifestation.
And just as for every individual, a manifestation comes that afterwards requires work, and that work is only to clarify the property of the manifestation, so too in the public [sphere] a supernal revelation that affects [the public] requires the work of generations to clarify all that is hidden in it.
And the work will never apprehend the uttermost of what is hidden in the manifestation, which is much higher than [the work].
The manifestation of manifestations is the giving of the Torah, which all generations continuously delve into, continuously work to reveal its light. And even the flashes of manifestation [of the generations] are the offspring of this super-universal manifestation.

Paragraph 424

The intellect is a blend of inner concepts that come to a person from within himself and are revealed in him as something that is continuously revealed from within outward, and of outer concepts that come to a person from without inward.
They encounter each other, and from their blending and their ferment, an intellectual revival is aroused in all of its amplitudes.

Paragraph 425

[A person’s] knowledge must expand and deepen. [His] depth of knowledge is aligned with [his] will. When [his] knowledge deepens, it takes [his] will along to every place it spreads.

Paragraph 426

Sometimes [a person’s] will is weak because of the weakness of [his] body, and [his] spiritual aspect is unprepared to establish itself because [it] lacks a built-up physicality to grasp. [A person’s] neglect of [his] physicality adds pain to this, whereas an orderly healing of the body raises the spiritual light and strengthens it.
This principle applies as well to the entire nation, and in particular it is revealed to [the people of] Israel in the days preceding the messiah, [expressing itself as] a demand for physical strength, whose inner goal, at any rate, is the elevation of the soul and [the soul’s] blazing illumination.

Paragraph 427

There is a righteous person who is beset by great, incalculable obstacles. [That is] because, were he to proceed on his level systematically, he would remove the trait of judgment entirely from the world. [But] the world [still] needs it until the final time.

Paragraph 428

When a person is stripped of every garment of wisdom, everything appears to him as straightforward. Therefore, he is [never] surprised and [never] attains knowledge.
That is prevalent both on intellectual levels and on moral levels: a person upon whom the illumination of the supernal soul has not been revealed cannot perceive moral disturbances in ideas that all people commend, and he absorbs everything, together with the trash.
[But] when the light of independent uprightness is revealed in a person, he immediately sees the moral flaws that exist in the thoughts that human beings take from the Source of holiness. Cosmic secrets are revealed to him, and he raises [his] thoughts and purifies the holy from all of its impurities.

Paragraph 429

“A person is obligated to say: the world was created for me” (<i>Sanhedrin </i>37a).
He should not let the existence of wicked people with corrupt deeds and perspectives weaken his mind at all. And if his inclination is toward kindness, he should consider that he can benefit the entire world, in keeping with the verse, “He will deliver the person who is not innocent” (<i>Job </i>22:30).
But this deliverance will come [only] as a result of his constantly growing in holy levels: of mind, and of supernal holiness and might.

Paragraph 430

A person who has a strong leaning to spiritual areas of knowledge—which are overall the knowledge of God and its branches—is a savant in this field.
He must repair all of his deeds and all of his studies for the sake of growing close to God with a good mind, and unite himself to areas of wisdom and knowledge that give him knowledge of his Maker.
And he should know that he must always increase wisdom and the knowledge [transmitted by] the holy ones, and make learning schedules for himself that are appropriate for this elevated purpose of his.

Paragraph 431

When we learn about the commandments and we engage in them with a committed love, we arouse in [our] the spirit the supernal love [that has come down] from the source of Divine wisdom, which is where the foundation of the commandments rests. And that is an elevation from below to above.
And when we appreciate with a good mind how beloved the commandments are, and [our] heart is aroused to love them until [our] hands and instruments of action are inspired to perform them, that is a descent from above to below.
And when the qualities of these two types of ideas blend in a worthy form, a very complete spiritual content will appear.

Paragraph 432

In prayer, we encounter the feeling that comes [to us] transmitted by [our] forefathers, and we say, “Our God and the God of our forefathers.”
And in the commandments, we rise to the entirety of the world, and we wish to perfect it by elevating our practical self, and we thus [recite] in [the formula of] a blessing, “King of the world, Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us.”

Paragraph 433

Mikveh and well, renewing and receiving.
The praiseworthiness of one is in rest, in containment. And the praiseworthiness of the other is in flow, in streaming.
Sealed pit and surging wellspring.

Paragraph 434

All topics in existence and in ideas constitute material by means of which the spirit of the human being may rise.
In the ordinary way, [these topics] are divided into levels, one above the other. And in keeping with a large ascent, everything ascends on the steppes of holiness.
And that is the attribute of Rav Hamnuna Saba. He did not [just] draw [water] from a pitcher—a <i>kad</i>—which [represents] the 24 books of the Torah [(the numerical value of <i>kad </i>is 24)]. Rather, he swam in the Great Sea, [which is] the source of the Torah.
Therefore, it was specifically he who could arrange a chapter of words of foolishness [to tell] his students before presenting words of wisdom, in order to fulfill “the advantage of light [coming] from the darkness” (cf. <i>Ecclesiastes </i>2:13; <i>Zohar</i>, Vol. 3, 47b).

Paragraph 435

The Schopenhauerian perspective regarding the will is not intrinsically distant [from the truth].
All of its evil is only that, in place of understanding [this viewpoint] as [just] one perspective on reality, the person with this approach understands it as all reality and its causation.
And that is an obduracy that emerges from an attestation that “we have not seen it,” which is no proof, whereas all those whose spiritual eyes are open see not only a blind and deaf will, but [a will that is] filled with counsel and understanding.
The deafness and muteness in the will are revelations of the lowly avenue of the power of creativity, in the practical zone. There is a supernal purpose to allow [the will] to remain in such a dull state, just as there is a similar goal in keeping animals from [possessing] the mind of a human being.
At the beginning of the line [of creation], the will is everything and contains everything. It is [then] continuously lowered [and] is revealed in diminishment after diminishment, until in the end all that is revealed is its independent, isolated foundation: the will alone, lacking any other positive description.
The human will greatly affects the spreading of the universal will. In the future, [the human will] will raise [the universal will] from its descent and give it power and life until heaven and earth will rejoice in their revival, after they had descended to the gates of death without power of life and without feeling and knowledge.

Paragraph 436

The most clear and holy faith in the Divine rests on a soul that is filled with absolute freedom.
[If a person] has not entirely purified his traits and deeds, [then] commensurate with the extent of his blemishes it is not fit that the light of supernal faith, which is based on the foundation of supernal freedom, should shine in his soul.
[But] the stronger the attribute of teshuvah grows in a person and [so the more] he is likely to cling to the supernal love, [correspondingly] freedom is revealed to him. And with it he clings to the light of faith, [which is] the root of every sort of holiness.

Paragraph 437

Every thought that, if taken to its extreme, would necessarily destroy the good and happiness in the world, causes damage as well even when it is not yet taken to its extreme.
And that is the secret behind false viewpoints, which destroy all spiritual wealth, and obscure existence and life.

Paragraph 438

Sometimes, [when] a person wants to be absolutely righteous, he feels that his every moral flaw and every slightest sin is a wall that separates him from his Father in heaven. In consequence, he is liable to fall and grow distanced [from holiness.
He must always be aware that “Hashem is close to all who call Him” (<i>Psalms </i>145:18).
Even if a person committed sins of the sort that, he thinks, are among those items/ elements/ instruments/ issues things that prevent teshuvah or prayer, he should not let that prevent [his] teshuvah or [his] prayer.
[That is] because possibly his eyes will be granted perception so that he will realize that what he had thought is a great sin is only small or no sin at all. And sometimes what he thought is a sin, so much so that it leads to the loss of the world-to-come or that it prevents teshuvah and seals off prayer, is a great merit that raises him to the height of holiness.

Paragraph 439

[A person’s performance of] all of the commandments must be based on the ethics related to [his] character traits, even though [the commandments] proceed on a very profound path that the simple eye cannot reach.
Even [if a person has] no knowledge and awareness, the effect [of performing the commandments] still comes about. But [that performance will] add beauty commensurate when the [person’s] knowledge discovers the relationship between [his performance of] the commandment and [his] personal ethics.

Paragraph 440

The hidden explanations [provided by] the Divine wisdom [of Kabbalah] help establish [our understanding of] Divinity [via] all positive descriptions [of God]. They completely remove the imperfection in [positive descriptions] and supernally fulfill the perfection in [these descriptions], via which alone [a person’s] clinging to the Divine comes to the level of acting upon life in all of [life’s] details—[something] that [Maimonidean] logic and “negative theology” cannot bring about, [because they] can only nurture one of the paths of human awareness.
Thus, faith always reveals that which is hidden [yet] allows it to remain in its hidden state, so that it will be a power that gives life to all life—all-inclusively—and not [a power] that only develops a detail, even if it be the most glorious of details.

Paragraph 441

The spiritual movements of the intellect and of the will must both be arranged, and their arrangement demands practical education, which is the secret of the Torah.

Paragraph 442

The entire world is dealing with crumbs of thoughts, such that it cannot find the living oneness in them. And because there are so many crumbs, the oneness hides.
Masters of the inner idea come and roll off [the stone to reveal] the light of unity. And they do not take into consideration whether the promulgation of crumbs of thoughts will be placed under pressure by them and, like them, will be diminished.

Paragraph 443

What do we think about the Divine goal in producing existence?
We say that absolute wholeness is the necessary existent, and it has nothing in potential but everything in actuality.
However, there is a wholeness [that consists] of the increase of wholeness, something that is impossible in Divinity, because the absolute, infinite wholeness leaves no room for increase.
And in order that [this] goal of increasing wholeness will not be missing from existence, cosmic existence must come into being and, commensurate with that, [it must] begin from the lowest depths—that is to say, from a state of absolute lack—and constantly rise to the absolute ascent.
And existence was created with this quality: that it will never cease ascending, because the activity of such [ascent] is unending.
And in order to assure ascent in the essence of existence, all [existence] was created with a supernal elevated quality. [However, this] elevated quality was greater than the measure of what the finite quality [of the universe] could be in actuality, although it could be [that] in potential. Therefore, with the manifestation of existence in actuality, damage occurred, and [various] powers were entangled with each other.
And [now] they engage in a ferocious war, [which will last] until the absolute, infinite thought of goodness will triumph, and everything will be rectified with the addition of the elevated quality of allowing room for the wholeness of unceasing ascent, which is a special Eden with which Creation makes whole the glory of its Creator.

Paragraph 444

Saul was greater than David (<i>Yoma </i>22b), and therefore, in the essence of his soul the trait of compassion shone even for Amalek.
But that is a trait that only lays the groundwork for sovereignty, that causes [sovereignty] to shine for a [limited] period. [But it] cannot [make sovereignty] last, because of the darkness of the world. And thus, [the trait of compassion] cannot elevate the world.
But the pious people of the world must in every generation hold onto the traits of Abraham, with the idea that their kindness spreads over everything, and they find the good everywhere. “And the Torah of kindness is on their tongue” (<i>Proverbs </i>31:26).

Paragraph 445

Sometimes there is a steadfastness that destroys the entire spiritual wealth of the steadfast person.
And [there is] a type of non-doing that fills the entire world of a person with holiness and might: the secret of silence.

Paragraph 446

Eternal existence in its Aristotelian sense, as something made requisite by the cognition of the [Divine] intellect, does not cut off the branches of morality as much as [does] the [concept] of an eternal materiality without any positive spiritual beginning, according to which view there can be a victory for some evil made requisite by the aspect of the conditions of materiality—which is not the case regarding the view of [an Aristotelian] requisite eternality, in which ultimately goodness will necessitate goodness.
In regard to the <i>Kuzari</i>, which said that there is no blemish in believing in an eternal materiality, one may say that this is specifically referring to the concept of [such a] requisiteness brought about by cause and effect [stemming] from the First Cause, because in this way [the concept of eternality] does not destroy the determinative factor of morality.

Paragraph 447

In [the pre-messianic time of] the “heels of the messiah,” souls are lowly on the external level of the structure [of the Jewish people], but the inner life in them is strong.
And from the day that the Temple was destroyed, the Holy One, blessed be He, mourns over its destruction (<i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, <i>Eichah </i>1022, 1025), “and cloud is the dust of His <i>feet</i>” (<i>Nahum </i>1:3).
The souls in the heels are not from the [external] garments but from an inner light of vitality.
But the souls prior to the [time of the] “heels of the messiah” also [included] souls from the garments, in which the inner being was not revealed.
Apparently, they stood in a place higher than the heel. However, they [were] like garments that are only like “the beauty of a person” (<i>Isaiah </i>44:13) [and not the person himself].

Paragraph 448

The gathering of the powers of a mighty life unites into a single great active power, as eternal salvation is revealed. “And Israel does great things” (<i>Numbers </i>24:18).
[But] the life of those who are exacting in the commandments who debilitate their bodies (cf. <i>Shabbat </i>86b) cannot inherently exhibit such thundering might.

Paragraph 449

At times, when we learn small matters with such great feeling that they impress our spirit as though they were the highest of the high, our consciousness grows corporeal, and the wings of our spirit are severed.
The proper path is to learn every topic with a joy that contains a double feeling.
[The first is] a feeling of supernal greatness, since every spiritual twig makes whole the entire Tree of Life. In this light, everything is great.
The second is a feeling that in the particular contents of all learning material, particularly of the Torah, there is a very positive value that is worth being appreciated with the joy of respect in accordance with its value.
Then the fire from above and the fire from below join to illuminate and warm our soul.

Paragraph 450

The human imagination and all of its natural propensities, whether of the individual or of the public, should be raised to the highest elevation.
[That] supernal intellectual and poetic ascent draws down exalted propensities and imaginations, which bring vast blessing.
And when [these two] streams, [one] rising and [the other] descending, meet on their way in a harmonious manner, there is a noble delight and Edenic joy, which is revealed for those whose heart is upright.

Paragraph 451

We throw away certain parts of the imagination and the will as trash, we cut [them] off and cast [them] away as a foreskin, and the remainder rises and is sanctified.

Paragraph 452

The Torah brings the spiritual world down to a person. With this, all supernal pleasures are open to him. This is a person’s happiness. It is the purpose for which he was created.
In order to bring the spiritual world down to him, he must feel his need. “I,” says God, “am with the oppressed” (<i>Sotah</i> 4b).
The Holy One, blessed be He, carved out all the mountains and hills of the world. But He rested His Presence on Mt. Sinai (<i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 13), a mountain that does not vault upward (<i>Mechilta</i>, <i>Yitro</i> 19:20).

Paragraph 453

The lack of Torah is Gehennom itself.
And the flow of the exterior will, in opposition to the inner will (<i>Midrash Mishlei </i>10), is the straits of Gehennom, which grow in strength in keeping with the level of the obstruction of the Torah’s light.

Paragraph 454

The more a person grows, the [more the] entire world grows with him.

Paragraph 455

To love this world well, we must submerge ourselves deeply in the love of the world-to-come. We must carry out all the improvements of this world in the most comprehensive way possible. These in fact are comprehensive preparations for the sake of each detail and the complete entirety of the life of the world-to-come.
Only then will culture stride forward with confidence.
This is a great wisdom, which is known to faith. This wisdom is so great that it will ultimately conquer the entire world.
When despair fills each soul and the life of this world is devalued, then the love of the world-to-come approaches, offering the dew of life that will vivify the life of this world.
Elders and youth will gaze towards it together, and shine.
And kings and ministers, fighters and warriors, will find within it the source of the rich dew of their lives.

Paragraph 456

The sexual drive streams into the future, to the perfection of life that time will bring: the life of the world-to-come within this world. That future life is filled with complete beauty and pleasure; thus, great is the yearning and the strength of desire of the sexual drive, which is all-encompassing; only upon this drive does ultimate holiness rest its light.
The pure soul leads the sexual drive to its goal within the boundary of Torah, wisdom, rectitude and modesty: the sources of righteousness. “Whoever guards the covenant is called righteous” (Zohar 1:59b)
The basis of the holiness of Israel is tied to the world of the future. A holy spirit continuously embraces the entirety of the nation and its individuals. “Your people are all righteous” (Isaiah 60:21).

Paragraph 457

The great perspectives enlarge the smallest thoughts that exist in every person.

Paragraph 458

We must acquire the [way of] seeing [that leads to] the acquisition of peace, intellectual and moral.
[Then] we will not wish to forfeit anything outside our circle, [simply] because we fear its contradictions. Confidently, we can go on our way without fearing contradictions, because everything aligns and unites.
There is no need to fear overmuch even because of ourselves, because of our moral corruptions. The heart’s courage is the foundation of victory.

Paragraph 459

One cannot imagine the great level of the kabbalistic knowledge regarding the topic of two souls, holy and impure, in [each] person, and how each [soul] yearns to increase its governance in the human body.
Only with this understanding can we gaze at the hidden matters of the soul and understand the deeds of human beings.
And the moral wisdom [that comes] as a result of this understanding can assuredly [lead a person] to conduct his deeds without [entering upon] the way of [internal] contradictions.
And higher than this comes the knowledge regarding the holy soul itself, which is [comprised of] two spirits: a spirit of this world and a spirit of the world-to-come.
It is fitting to recognize that these two spirits also engage in somewhat of a war between themselves. But this is a war of peace filled with love and respect that each spirit feels for the other.
But they are two. And so, when one [of them] grows in strength and the yearnings of the world-to-come fill [a person’s] heart in all their height, then the spirit of this world cannot continue fully with its deeds, not even the most elevated among them. And [on the other hand,] when the spirit of this world grows in strength, then the spirit of the world-to-come sits at a distance and only sends slight sparks to illuminate the way of the spirit of this world as it “proceeds in a straight way” (<i>Song of Songs </i>7:10).
After the <i>Akeidah</i>, Isaac was unique, because only the spirit of the world-to-come was alive in him.
Due to of the great manifestation of the supernal light upon him, it is he who will seal the thought of forgiveness in the [messianic] future, and he will not answer the challenge that “Your children have sinned” [with the words,] “May they be eradicated for the holiness of Your name,” as will Abraham and Jacob (<i>Shabbat </i>89b).
[That is] because the existence of the world and the might of the kindness that brings absolute forgiveness come specifically from the supernal spirit that rises above this world so that it can give [the world] life constantly and gaze upon it for the good, to the entire depth of [the world’s] particularity and generality.
[A person] who is higher than this entire world finds all of the goodness of this world before him, and he plants and finds a hundredfold [increase] that grows continuously.

Paragraph 460

We recognize the will [immanent in] the universe: a level that is revealed as the soul of the life of existence, as the will that acts and yearns; [and] whose branches are revealed in everything: in inanimate matter, plant life, animal life and humanity, in all [their] details and details of details, [as well as] in the broadest generalities.
We go with [that will] to the perimeter of its breadth, [and] we reach the firm realization that this will has the goal of rising.
It rises when its particular manifestations rise. [These are] the souls of the righteous. [When they] cause [the immanent will] to be satiated with drive, its conduits open and a flow of the Eden of [that] drive sends [down] a trickle of all good, life, peace and qualities of Eden.
[As a result of] these streams of favor and blessing, [this] general [immanent] will is able to receive from the [transcendent,] supernal desire, from the light of will and might that is at the heights, elevated and raised above [the immanent will], surrounding the ideal worlds in all their fullness [with] a flow of joy and eternal blessing.
[Then] the world is made secured, and every concept and act is blessed. And the blessing makes it possible for [our] thoughts to receive impressions of [that] greatness without admixtures of false imaginings, without weakness [caused by] doubts, and without any element of damage. And everything proceeds in an upright manner.
The righteous rejoice before God. They perform the holy service of wisdom and knowledge, of morality and justice, of adjusting themselves to holiness, to might and glory, with clear awareness, with a clear purpose.
And the spirit of the king messiah continuously pulses in the world. “The voice of my beloved: behold, it comes, leaping upon the mountains, jumping upon the hills” (<i>Song of Songs </i>2:8).

Paragraph 461

Let us war against smallness, which does not allow us to consider tranquilly, in detail, the wealth of great things stored in the soul.

Paragraph 462

Why did the shattering come? [It is] because the Divine [expressed through the Shechinah] gives in accordance with [the Shechinah’s] power, and the recipient is limited. That being the case, the goodness is limited.
Therefore, [the Holy One, blessed be He,] gives goodness without measure, in keeping with His attribute, and [that goodness] is Divine, without limit, although the recipient, the created being, can only receive [it] by being entirely shattered.
And he will be built with his desire to return to his unlimited Source, to unite with Divinity.
And with that, the created being will make himself, and he will be on the level of the wholeness of the Creator, and he will rise above the limit of the created, something that had not been possible without the flow of the vast goodness that transcends the level of his ability to receive, which was always only on the level of the created, and not at all on the level of the Creator.

Paragraph 463

Natural people who are unlearned have an advantage in many things over those who are learned, by virtue of the fact that in [the former] natural intelligence and inherent morality have not been blurred by errors that arise from one’s studies and that come as a result of the weakening of one’s abilities and the short temper that are the consequence of bearing the yoke of studying.
Nevertheless, [these natural people] must receive guidance regarding the details of life from those who are learned.
And those who are learned must always emulate, as much as they can, the natural talent of the common people, both in perspective on life and in awareness of morality from its natural aspect. And then they will rise more and more in the development of their intellect.
This is the case even regarding the righteous and the wicked, because there are some wicked people in whom the good portion that remains is constructed with a strength that is so natural, inherent and pure that righteous people must learn from these people and receive from them. And precisely then the righteous people will rise to their supernal level.
And the same applies to all the nations in the relationship between each one and its fellow, and in particular [in the relationship] between the nations of the world and Israel.

Paragraph 464

Supernal holiness, which is the true clinging [to God], suffers from everything, even from the Torah and the commandments, because of their physical garments.
[But] sometimes it receives them with joy, as the sufferings of love.
And in most cases it succeeds so that matters will emerge from their narrow boundary to a free and expansive atmosphere.
“From the narrows have I called You, Hashem. Answer me in the breadth of Yah” (<i>Psalms </i>118:5).
“Narrows” is <i>meitzar</i>, spelled <i>mem-tzadi-reish</i>. The <i>mem-tzadi </i>of <i>meitzar </i>belongs to the word <i>mitzvah</i>. In the <i>at-bash </i>letter permutation, <i>mem-tzadi</i> becomes <i>yod-hey</i>, which spells <i>Yah</i>. Also, in “diminished numerology,” <i>meitzar </i>and <i>Yah</i> are numerically equal. The <i>mem-tzadi</i> comes to attach itself to the method of spelling a word called “the back of the word.” The back of the word <i>Elokim</i>, “God,” has the numerical value of the letter <i>reish</i>, which is the last letter of <i>meitzar</i>.
But [the narrows] rises to the “breadths of the river,” where Yah is carved brightly, and waves of [Yah’s] lights spill across the entire breadth of its Edenic [nature] in the “breadth of Yah.”

Paragraph 465

With Divine inspiration, we truly note how every word of prayer and blessing, even when it emerges in a whisper, projects the sound of mighty thunder.
In keeping with [the measure of] the purity and spotlessness of [that] Divine inspiration, the contents are revealed of the revelation of [these] mighty sounds with the multiplicity of details and the force of their pleasantness.

Paragraph 466

Due to [the influence] of the concepts of [the highest of the four worlds,] <i>atzilut </i>(“emanation”), practical ideas are forgotten, and the world experiences rupture and deficiencies in all of its ways.
To deal with that, people zealous for practical ideas and their outcomes regain their power in the world by pushing back the ideas of <i>atzilut</i>.
The people with the thoughts of <i>atzilut </i>look favorably at all of the practical rectifications that practical people make, even though these come to them by means of the unenlightened process of pushing away the glory of <i>atzilut</i>.
When the people of <i>atzilut </i>look favorably at the practical rectifications, the practical ideas are refined. [Then] the [lowest] world of <i>asiyah </i>(“action”) proceeds to bond with the world of <i>atzilut </i>by means of the elevated intermediaries of the [third lowest] world, <i>yetzirah </i>(“formation”), which is filled with feeling and image, and the [second lowest] world, <i>beriah</i> (“creation”), which is filled with understanding and song.

Paragraph 467

Some people are so saintly, so great is their tendency toward supernal holiness, that their hearts are empty of any love for this world. They lack even that portion of love for this world that is fit to exist in a person's heart.
As a result, they find imperfection in their human character, and they cannot be leaders in this world.
And so they must retrieve their love for this world. They do so through prayer, which deals with impermanent things; and through the in-depth study of Jewish law and this-worldly discussions of the Torah, in all their detailed ramifications. Then they have a love for the world that becomes a love of holiness, and which unites with the love of Torah.
Through these people, the world is elevated.

Paragraph 468

Those people who are wise of heart truly recognize the nothingness of this world in and of itself. They raise their thought and the configuration of their [view of this] world to the level of the world-to-come with its contentedness.
Since they see that all existence is one continuum, this world too becomes beautiful for them, and as a result they seek to repair it and improve it.
As a result, righteous people, who are holy in spirit, have the will [to bring about] the civilizing and improvement of the life of this world by means that transcend with a mighty spirit everything that the spirit of man has discovered in his external love for this world in and of itself.
This [external] love is based on chaos and falsehood—although it is needed for the existence of the world and its settlement. [It is requisite] that people should be infatuated with the world, but much greater than this will be the habitation [of the world] that will result from a complete awareness.

Paragraph 469

The purpose of everything is to know Hashem.
As wisdom grows in a person and in the world, we must always start from the beginning of everything.
How painful is a darkened knowledge of Hashem. It does not cease depressing a person’s soul. It is a curse that destroys everything, that swallows all energy, all strength and all ability, that transforms glory into misery.
Woe to the spiritual awareness and aspiration that does not stand upon the broad basis of all of the wholesome physical needs of the individual and of society.
Mental laziness and weakness, which cause a person to fall prey to the corruption of errors, coalesces into a species of spiritual tendency [that causes] all wholesome physical content to appear as transgression in its eyes.
That muddies everything. And that is the wickedness and the guile that the rising light of Hashem expels with all [its] power from the earth.

Paragraph 470

Every thought is a complete world in itself.
From each thought, many conduits may spread out to fill the entire world with its abundance of light.
Every thought has [its own] unique vision. If we come to compare it to the vision of another thought, we will find that they contradict each other. [But] right next to their prominent contradiction we will find that they also build each other.

Paragraph 471

Sometimes the impeccable lights are hidden from the soul because they rise to the supernal root of the soul in order to receive from it a flow of life, favor and supernal awareness. And below in the body, it appears as though everything has been destroyed and everything is darkened.
Then it is possible to look at the rectifications of the physical world with an approving and penetrating eye.
And afterwards, lights suddenly come from the heights, and waves of many lights spill into the soul with supernal wisdoms and multiple edens. “And His counsel is with the upright” (<i>Proverbs </i>3:32).

Paragraph 472

When we learn in holiness and an uplifted soul, the breadth of the entire Torah can be seen: how it emerges from the source of its holiness, from the source of the Congregation of Israel, and how all of the individual laws spread like the branches of the light of life from the source of life of the entire people.

Paragraph 473

If a person lacks a sense of antipathy towards the wicked, [then their] evil qualities, actions and perspectives can cling to him and injure him.
And although, as a result of the great sweetening [caused by this person’s] kindness, light shines as well upon the wicked, he should at any rate, to a degree, maintain a severity that recognizes, with an inner antipathy, those tremendously wicked people who raise [their] hand against the Torah.
This trait is like a sandal for the soul, so that its feet will not be soiled by the deep mud of the husks. [Instead,] this quality will protect it in its purity.

Paragraph 474

How do we think from above to below?
We contemplate elevated ideals and inclusive, uplifted thoughts. From them, we engender offspring: details, and details of details. [We view them either as] branch following branch, or [as] many glimpses [seen] simultaneously.
In that way, thoughts proceed expansively. [A person’s] mental faculty does its work capably [and] fluently, and [his] soul is filled with light and calm.
However, when we think from below to above, we [first] receive some detail: a thought or a deed. We split it into fragments of fine slivers. From [that], we go [upward] to the concept that engendered it, and from that concept to one more primary than itself. In that way, we climb and rise to the heights of the most exalted ideas.
On that path, there is exertion and weariness, [and] a great many doubts and complex pathways beyond investigation. These are clarified in keeping with the extent to which a particular exertion receives its flow of light from the caliber of the upright thought [that proceeds] from above to below.
And when [these] two cognitive inclinations strike each other, they create special spiritual qualities.
[Then the letters of the alphabet flow from beginning to end and from end to beginning, intertwining with each other:] <i>alef-tov</i>, <i>beit-shin</i>, <i>gimel-reish</i>, <i>dalet-kuf</i>.

Paragraph 475

From the most debased of the debased, who only recognize the truth that is revealed to them in their heart, and who are not subject to any other influence that does not unite with the depth of their inner soul—although their awareness is very small, materialistic, and lowly, nevertheless, they are worthy of the flourishing of salvation.
They are the dust of Jacob—“who has counted them?” (<i>Numbers </i>23:10). And from this dust will blossom “truth for Jacob” (<i>Micah </i>7:20), which rises ever upward.

Paragraph 476

Heresy’s spirit of smashing through barriers purifies all of the infection that has gathered in the under area of the spirit of faith. As a result, the heavens are purified [so that] the clear light within the character of supernal faith – which constitutes the song of the world and truth of the world – is revealed. 
As a result, the heavens will be purified, and the clear light in the constitution of supernal faith—which is the song of the world and the truth of the world—will appear.

Paragraph 477

A sign that a thought contains dregs is that it dims the light of the concept and hinders its free expansion.

Paragraph 478

Immediately with the entry into the soul of a concept of [ontological] existence comes the concept of [defined] quality.
And just as the concept of [ontological] existence is a conduit for life in the soul of a person in his relationship to [the One Who is] high above high, the imaging of [defined] quality is the conduit of death and of the garbling of concepts.

Paragraph 479

The Divine thought [in a person] is sustained by all thoughts and all information.
And it increases and intensifies by means of the sustenance that appears to come from outside it into it.

Paragraph 480

The supernal thought, which is the soul of all thoughts, does not nullify any thought in the world, but it refines everything and brings it back to the good.

Paragraph 481

The deep holy spirit of Judaism strives to unite the life of activity and the life of transcendence. This spirit is the soulful power that generates Jewish law and its minutiae. It provides the [energy-giving] “starch” for Talmudic logic, expanding its borders in the this-worldly environs of Jewish law and Talmudic reasoning.

Paragraph 482

Sometimes, due to the descent of [a person’s] spirit and [his] inability to soar in the pure expanses of a lofty spirit and of concepts of quintessential life in their tremendous purity, [his] spirit is driven back [until] it produces many thoughts [that have] the limited qualities of deed and of a resultant minutiae-focused cogitation.
“‘He has made me dwell in dark places like the dead of the earth’ (<i>Psalms </i>143:3): that is the Babylonian Talmud” (<i>Sanhedrin </i>24a). Nevertheless, that too will be transformed to light, since the soul of light generated it.
Although [Rachel] gave birth to “the son of my pain” (<i>Genesis </i>35:16)—“she experienced difficulty in her giving birth” (ibid. 16)—[the baby’s] father called him Benjamin (“the son of my right hand”), and the wise midwives were justified in telling [Rachel], “Do not be afraid, because this too is a son for you” (ibid. 17).

Paragraph 483

There are people who are equipped for physical labor and intended for it. They cannot comprehend Divinity with a purity that can [serve as] a basis of the constant service of Hashem.
And there are people who are dedicated to [engage in] the constant service of Hashem, who can illuminate the ideal form of Divine service in themselves to the point of alignment with the limited form of the focused service of the sacrificial offerings.
It is requisite that there should be such people: that the ideal content of the world, which is the absolute Divine secret in existence, will fill all of the crevices of their soul, and no tangential practical yoke will be placed upon them.
That is the secret of the cohanim, who do not take a portion in the Land and in the spoils, [but] Hashem is their inheritance (cf. <i>Joshua </i>13:33).

Paragraph 484

Just as, regarding an individual who turns his ear away from hearing Torah, his prayer is an abomination (cf. <i>Proverbs </i>28:9), so too in the totality of the world: to the degree that, commensurate with its level, it lacks the elevation of the Torah, its prayer becomes abominable.
The radiance and glory of prayer may be restored by raising the horn of the Torah in its supernal aspect. Then all of the stormy questions that constantly rage regarding the character of prayer and the concept of Divine service in general will be silenced.
And the soul’s naturalness that seeks the dew of a life of prayer will return to its vigorous standing.

Paragraph 485

The doctrine of evolution, which is at present conquering the world, aligns with the secrets of the world of the kabbalah more than the other philosophical doctrines do.
Evolution, which proceeds upon an avenue of elevation, provides the world with the principle of optimism: because how can [we] despair when we see that everything is developing and rising?
And when we penetrate to the core of the principle of ascendant evolution, we find that within it the topic of the Divine is illuminated with absolute clarity: that precisely the “actualized” Infinite One works to actualize that which is infinite in potential.

Paragraph 486

The fear of death is the illness of all mankind, coming in consequence of sin. Sin caused death (<i>Genesis </i>2:17), and teshuvah is the sole medicine to expunge it from the world.
The entirety of man’s effort is aimed at deliverance from death. And he will only reach his goal when he magnifies his soul [by drawing] from its inner source.
[A person’s] immersion in the dust of materialism and his enthusiasm for all of [materialism’s] values only magnifies [his] fear of death, and so it adds fear to [his] fear.
[Then,] all of a person’s struggles not to fear [death] do not help him at all, since he is investing his entire existence in those constituents over which death rules, and which it destroys and devastates.
How will the heart not burst over beauty transformed to ugliness and over loveliness transformed to repulsiveness?
When life has no purpose, death is necessarily threatening. [Then] the war against it is in vain. Bravura does not help at all.
The true medicines by means of which the world is freed from enslavement to death are hidden in the storehouse of life—in the soul of the Torah—which is revealed with all of its revelations, and [which at the same time] is continuously concealed in its mighty hiding place.
The chief of all medicines is the expansion of [a person’s] days: the expansion of [his] days in the measure that suffices for his nature: spiritual and material, individual and familial, universal and national.
When this blessing spreads throughout the world, the form of death that imposes terror is nullified, and in its place comes the form of a vision of being, [a vision that is] fit to be evaluated for its true worth.
And then [a person’s vision] no longer hampers [his] concepts, and [his] comprehension is again evident, [showing] that there is no death here at all in keeping with the dismal and wrecked image that dwells in the heart of the living to depress them.
And as we look on the day of death, we sing (<i>Berachot </i>10a), “Hashem my God, You have been very magnified, You have been clothed in glory and splendor” (<i>Psalms </i>104:1).
[This] expansion of [a person’s] days comes when [he] rectifies [his] life in all its senses—in particular, in the moral sense, which is continuously expanding [and] deepening upon all of the paths that branch out from itself.
The spirit of supernal morality, which measures [the value of] life, lives and dwells in [a person’s] soul in keeping with the extent to which he views [life] in its own light.
And [a person] can only see life in its full light [when he is] mindful of the living God, the Source of wisdom, kindness and might, united.
Also effective is the development of [a person’s] national spirit, in that he feels the well-being of the overall group with an inner, living feeling, and he rejoices in the joy of the nation, as a limb of its limbs. With this, the fear of death from the aspect of the vision of his own material eradication weakens, because the nation in its generations, from which all of his wellsprings [emerge], remains.
But this is not the core of being rescued from the fear of death, because ultimately [a person’s] individual essence is stunned [when he considers] the shattering of its being.
The essential guidance to remove the fear of death must come from accustoming oneself to love life in its true worth.
As long as everything is dim and [a person] can make an accounting of [his] life only in a turmoil, [his] traits cannot be purified. And so [he] cannot love life.
[In that case,] the entire topic of the love of life comes only by means of [his] chimerical fear of death, and [then] it is completely impossible to speak about removing this fear, which is the salt of [his] life.
However, life need not always stand on such a meager level that [a person] finds its value not [in itself] intrinsically but in fearing its opposite.
Via [a person’s connection to] the holiness of life in its supernal character, [he] can come to love life inherently.
But in order for that [to happen,] the value of the whole must be revealed to [his] soul—that is to say, existence in its entire scope: man and his soul, the level of the good will and absolute morality in [its] eternal character, the value of the spiritual in harmony with corporealized life and existence.
And that includes an important part of the content of the wisdom of the Divine and [that wisdom’s] inner recognitions.
The foundation [of this] lies in the elevation of [a person’s] will and its delving into the depth of [his] awareness, its bonding with [that awareness] and its absolute uniting with it.
The secret of the removal of the foreskin is the raising of [a person’s] desire for life to [its] supernal, ultimate extent, until [his] entire reproductive drive and all of its spiritual parts connected to it, the entire host of romanticism with all of its branches, are all holy parts of the powerful desire for life, bringing [that power] forth [from where it was lacking, so that it is at] the zenith of might and purity of desire, [a zenith] that impresses the pleasantness of love upon all existence.
When the good value of life is recognized, [life] itself removes from the eyes of discernment the cataract that hinders the clarification of the knowledge of spiritual reality and its levels of absolute life.
Then the spiritual world begins to proliferate, with the entire beauty of its fullness. It feels its might and its freedom. And life on the level of the soul is revealed—not only as some vestige of physical life (whereas [physical life] appears as the full [life]), but as inherent greatness, [and] of [this soulful] life, the life connected to the body and its accompanying conditions is only a spark and shadow.
In this way, with the assistance of tangential factors—the economic, family, national situation and the essential satiety of natural life—which accompany [that inherent greatness], the fear of death is completely removed, and [death] is transformed into a source of joy and trust. “And the righteous man takes refuge in his death” (<i>Proverbs </i>14:32).
And when this character of life spreads throughout the world, liberation from the angel of death, at the height of [that liberation’s] fullness, comes.
And such a stance of life can prepare the world for [that life].
However, it is not the individual who will gather the strength for that but the nation: a nation among nations, a holy, miraculous nation, a chosen nation and the treasured of all the peoples, whose children are the children of Hashem their God (cf. <i>Deuteronomy </i>14:1).
It is they who are commanded, “You shall not cut yourselves nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead, because you are a holy nation to Hashem your God, and Hashem has chosen you to be a treasured nation for Him of all the nations upon the face of the earth” (<i>Deuteronomy </i>14:1-2).
Removing death, which is a disgrace for a holy nation, and [removing] all of [death’s] fears and depressions mark the beginning of a constructive culture that gladdens life in all of its capacities. To that we are called, and for the sake of that we fight.
And all of the descents that we have experienced will not displace our feet from the supernal purpose carried in our soul.
We will surely reach it via all of the stages and via all of the convoluted paths. We shall surely reach that freedom for whose sake we live.

Paragraph 487

To free a person by [helping] him rise, by [helping] him develop himself, via the revelation of all of his inner abilities: that is our goal.
And in the inner aspect of matters, that is the Divine goal for existence. [It is] the goal of mankind’s hidden yearning.
Distant goals, those which are exalted, elevate the soul.
But they are important factors for the culture only when they actuate all of the ways of life of intermediate goals that are in concert with the spirit of the intermediate person, [so that the distant goals] will help the [intermediate] goals.
Then the externality of the world does not turn its back and does not battle its inner being.

Paragraph 488

Inner-directed people are stunned when externality raises its banner high in life.
But they must know that then [and] only then is inner being victorious: when it finds before itself an ordered and structured world [of] healthy limbs and a robust heart, developed senses, configurations of beauty, cleanliness and purity, civilized morality, uprightness, energy, and love of life and the world.
Then inner being can rule over a sovereignty that is filled with might.
And if, when external rulership is involved in itself, it does not know how to appreciate the inner being of life, which is the entire foundation of [life’s] loftiness, that is no reason for the hands of the inner-directed people to weaken.
They should hold their banner and strengthen their stance.
They should assist external being as well to strengthen itself in such a way that it will know at the time of the power of inner being—which will necessarily be revealed—how to adjust to its function of serving the inward goals of life and all existence.

Paragraph 489

Exile diminishes our character, oppresses us, but does not totally destroy even one grain of our faculties. We already contain all [the growth] that is prepared for us. Everything that needs to enlarge and flower is currently small, clenched shut, and dried out, but they will all grow and return and flower; Israel will blossom and flower.
Everything prepared for us is found with us.
Everything that must be great and blossoming is small, clenched and shriveled, but everything will grow, everything will again blossom. “Israel will flourish and blossom” (<i>Isaiah </i>27:6).

Paragraph 490

The newest power that will be revealed in the world to renew life with a complete redemption [will be] the great value of man’s will in [the context of] all existence, when it [will be] made whole with its total wholeness.
That is what we yearn for. All of our actions are directed toward that: to reveal Divinity in man’s will.
And we reveal that through the program of elevating man and sanctifying his will. That is a prelude to reaching the might of the will, the revelation of Divinity in the will itself, [as the will] rises above all toil and all practical ability, which are solely “vanity and an evil spirit” (<i>Ecclesiastes </i>4:4, 6:9) when compared to the supernal level of the elevation of the will to its source and [to] its actualized revelation.
That ideal is not cut off from Israel. It is the constant ascent of the Shechinah, for which we strive every day in our service. [It is] the elevation of man’s will until [it will] take its place designated for it in [the context of] the will of existence.
And then the will of all existence, the light of the will of the manifestation of the absolute Divine revelation, [will] reveal itself to [man].
[Then] everything [will be] renewed in a great light, in new life, in a new song, in a renewed nature, in new souls, in new perspectives, in new feelings, in a renewed image of the world, in renewed wills, in a new trust. [It will be renewed] in a new relationship to heaven and earth, to all existence, to man and to all creatures, to all hues of life, to the revealed and to the hidden, to the spiritual and to the physical, to life in the body and to life outside the body, to limited awarenesses and to unlimited awarenesses, to particular sparks and to universal sparks, to vessels that contain and to what they contain. A new relationship will be created for all [of these] with a renewal of the revelation of the true value of man’s will in [the context of] existence.
And that shall come about as a result of removing the rust and pollution from the will, as a result of discarding the external and internal foreskin, [and] as a result of wiping out Amalek in man and in nations, with the eradication of the spirit of impurity from the entire world.

Paragraph 491

When we consider man and other creatures, we can [compose] an entire list of correspondences in which man and all [other] living beings are equal.
Nevertheless, after all of [these] correspondences, we see that the point upon which man’s superiority to animals [is something that] embraces the entire stature of man.
Man cannot and does not wish to exchange it for any wealth, and he will happily undergo many sufferings rather than lose his unique human quality.
The same applies to the difference between the religion of Israel and other religions, even those that result from its influence.
We can find a wealth of semblances of similarities between them. How is it possible not to find similarities, even if [they] were not taken fundamentally [by those religions] from [the Israelite religion]? Isn’t it the case that the spirit of the human being overall shares a number of aspects? Although there is a particular difference between individuals and, how much more, between groups and nations, the common denominator does not cease exercising its effect.
And in regard to the religions that came after the giving of the Torah and [after] the appearance of [the people of] Israel in the world—and, how much more, those particular [religions] that came in the wake of the Torah of Israel—certainly many similarities between them necessarily exist.
[But] these similarities, despite all of their many details, will not refute the inner point that separates them.
The entire soul character [of the Israelite religion] is not folded into [these] similarities. But [it is folded] into that differentiating point that gives it a unique soul even in regard to the details of the points similar [to the other religions]. And so that similarity [between them] is only superficial. But the difference in terms of [their] inner being is a maximal difference.
And Israel never can nor wants to lose the core point of [its] soul because of the shared details, [but] it will always maintain its own destiny. “Behold, a nation will dwell alone, and it will not be considered among the nations” (<i>Numbers </i>23:9).

Paragraph 492

Let us explain Judaism: but we must reach the depth of the abyss of knowledge and the height of [Judaism’s] heavens.
[Yet] with that, let us not lose the path in daily life: in simple ethics, in a pure heart, in joy and in grace, in calm and in love, and in all enthusiasm of the spirit—in the life of the individual, the nation, and mankind.

Paragraph 493

[A person’s] supernal awareness scales down. As it engages in a [personal] accounting of the world at the height of spirituality, it embraces within itself as well [the thought of] a wealth of actions in accord with itself.
When [these] actions are actualized in its form, it rises, and its light spreads expansively.
[But] when [a person’s] actions become the opposite of its concealed might, then the world is filled with contradictions, and the contradictions drag along castigations, wreckages and bewilderments.

Paragraph 494

Sometimes [a person’s] thought rises above the circumference of deed, above the border of ethics required by the people in keeping with their situation. And it crystallizes into a demand, and the demand crystallizes into a particular [type of] personality.
This personality makes his demand with a strong hand, with greatness of the soul. With that, he destroys the overall good in the life of the present, and as a result the good of the future as well.
And that which is rooted in supernal holiness again descends to the depths of ugliness and pollution, [because] it came prematurely.

Paragraph 495

Ethics in [one’s] character, and actions based on law: the latter are necessary for the [people as a] whole, and the former are necessary for an individual—who is, in some respects, the substance of the life of the [people as a] whole.
When [people] immerse themselves in law-based deeds so deeply that [they] forget their purpose, [the laws] sometimes weaken the energy of [their] character-based ethics. As a result, protest comes from those who champion overall ethics. [That protest] appears as a sort of rebuke of the exactitudes of laws.
But always [the purpose of] the supernal aspect of ethics is for [the people as a] whole to be a whole that stands connected, beautiful and alive. And for that, laws are necessary and requisite.
Therefore, law will always stand above ethics. Ethics will serve it as an assistant [so that a person will] keep the law with splendor, with a generosity of ethics.

Paragraph 496

A [person’s] supernal and pure connection to the Divine in no way opposes the world and life in all the depths of their character. It even improves and broadens them.
Had [the people of] Israel not sinned, they would not at all have needed to adapt any qualities from without in order to make themselves whole on all levels of life.
But because of [their] sin, the supernal thought was dimmed, and what remained was a secondary light, which does not possess the supernal brightness and absolute entirety of the total supernal, of the Divine thought, and so it does not have that quality of expanding—until at last [their] uniting with the character of the Divine connection reduced [their] ability [to possess] other abilities.
And [so] this necessitated the advent of [their] being scattered [into] the exile in order to perfect these imperfections, to absorb all of the superiorities of all of the [other] nations into themselves in order to make their character whole.
And the perfection of [their] character and the lengthy purifying of the national soul in the iron crucible of the exile facilitated the return of the supernal light.
That is the character of the light of the messiah, which is destined for us in all its greatness.
And great are those few [people] in every age and era who discuss wisdom and look forward to salvation (<i>Shabbat </i>31a), and who look toward the light of the messiah. Their mind is broadened until in the might of [their] connection to the Divine they attain many things (<i>Avot </i>6:1), and the entire world is worthy because of them.
That is the inheritance of those who engage in Torah for its own sake, who walk in the ways of Rabbi Meir, whose Torah spoke of “coats of light,” and of whom it was said, “This is your messiah” (<i>Yerushalmi Kilayim </i>9:3): that is to say, [he possessed] the illumination of the messiah, whose Torah can and must spread to all of the groups of the nations and their structures of governance, and [spread to] all paths of life and the accentuation of their details with the entire fulness of the might and splendor within them.

Paragraph 497

The precious reason for circumcision—that being the decrease of sexual desire—encompasses broad principles of wisdom. The bond of the covenant—“to be a God to you and to your children after you” (<i>Genesis</i> 17:7; <i>Yevamot</i> 64a)—offers knowledge of God's oneness, which is connected to circumcision. [The covenant and circumcision] are intimately intertwined.
“From his flesh does a man see God” (cf. <i>Isaiah</i> 19:26). If a person has the power to harness all the abilities of his soul and all his drives to an enlightened and ethical goal, he will see unity in his internal world. The unity of the outer world will become increasingly clear to him. But if his abilities are splintered, if he cannot conceive of overall control of his drives and desires, he will conclude that the entire world, like him, is splintered, and that no unity can be found in existence.
Sexual desire in its essence—and in related expressions, physical, imaginative and spiritual—comprises the basis of all drives. If a person experiences sexuality in a way that his exalted spirit can rise to it and surround it, can unify it with all the wealth of human abilities (physical and spiritual), leading it to one integrated ethical and supernal goal, then that unity, in its power, is revealed. The revelation of Godly unity will appear in a person’s flesh.
The total immersion of the human spirit in sexual desire to such a degree that the ideals and ethics in its realm are silenced has brought about the substance of the foreskin. This pathological state expresses itself physically as a powerful sexual drive that has left the ideal realm and the transmission of the ultimate ethics.
Pessimism corresponds to ethical decline. It impels the divorce of sexual desire from idealism: since existence in general is such a great evil, how can the procreation of miserable creatures be ideal? This doctrine teaches that the sexual drive is not rooted in idealism, but merely demonstrates the eruption of desire.
How different is the outlook of general goodness, of optimism: “God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good” (<i>Genesis</i> 1:31). This view permits idealism to extend even over the sexual drive.
The nature of flesh and the inclination of one's heart can descend to the degraded state of the foreskin. But with circumcision, a person rectifies the holy covenant and stride on an exalted path. All his abilities are directed toward a goal that is all-inclusive, ideal and holy. From his flesh he will see God (cf. <i>Job</i> 19:26). You will sanctify the Holy One of Israel, the one God.

Paragraph 498

[When we] relate [to matters] subjectively, we find contradictions [among] the various spiritual systems. One approach is greater than another, and every countenance in every spiritual phenomenon that is revealed as opposing the others testifies to division.
But when we rise to an objective vision, we find within ourselves the satisfaction of a propensity to oneness and a desire for peace, and we reflect that in the essence of matters, no separations, divisions, oppositions and disharmonies exist. [Rather,] “these and those are the words of the living God” (Talmudic saying), “because by the word of Hashem were the heavens made, and by the spirit of His mouth all of their host” (<i>Psalms </i>33:6). All existence, physical and spiritual, in all its aspects, in its totality, is the word of Hashem.
The work of thought is forever: to show [the people on] those paths that even our subjective feeling, without leaving [its] parameters, can attain the quality that unites everything and makes it whole.

Paragraph 499

The Torah of Israel explains how the existence of the world and human ethics depend on each other.
And so it is understood that the improvement of the world and the improvement of ethics are also connected with a permanent connection.
That is the essence of the [people of] Israel’s knowledge of God.
The sin of man debased his ethics overall until “the earth was filled with robbery” (<i>Genesis </i>6:11) [and all flesh] corrupted its way (cf. ibid. 12). It subverted the inclination of the thoughts of [man’s] heart (cf. ibid. 5).
The world rises up against [man]. A deluge descends and wipes out all existence.
[But then] the remaining root of man strengthens itself in its uprightness. [That] uprightness exerts itself in its connection with God. It stands and raises burnt offerings to Hashem (ibid. 8:20).
The world gains a foundation, and the covenant is made for its existence “all the days of the earth” (ibid. 22).

Paragraph 500

Each person [experiences] “weakness of hands [in learning] Torah” (<i>Midrash Tanchuma</i>, <i>Beshalach</i> 25) on his level.
If a person’s intellect reaches supernal intellectual thought but he satisfies himself instead with emotional faith, for him that is a “weakening of the hands.” He must repent for that and rise to the intellectual point that is appropriate for him.

Paragraph 501

A person’s thoughts that come from the external aspect of the world—even the most elevated among those [thoughts]—mislead him. Some inner inebriation is blended into them.
In its majority, the world is relinquished to this inebriation.
Only the remnant, wise of heart [and] supernally holy, who penetrate inner being with the power of their thought attenuate this inebriation with their supernal spiritual power.
And the more that they impress their stamp upon the world, the more it shines in its inner light.
And in place of the inebriation the holy light of the joy of delights appears.

Paragraph 502

A person’s happy state is one [in which] the pleasantness of Hashem, the delight of love, and supernal yearning appear in [his] soul in a calm and permanent manner.
On the basis of this, [his] flow of knowledge expands, and [his] supernal delights expand.
As a result of the flow of this supernal blessing, all [his] traits are sweetened and [his] soul grows refined. And [then] all souls, all living beings and all powers of existence that have a connection to this happy soul are blessed. And as a result, the entire world is blessed.
In order for the world to be established increasingly in this satisfied state, all politics and all wisdom of life must have [this] intent.
The [nation] closest to [taking] these supernal steps is Israel, the nation to which Hashem is close.
The righteous people of Israel must put their entire focus on sweetening all of the souls of all Israel by means of their own inner sweetness.
That is the most upright outcome of the most complete intentions of prayer and of the effects of [meditative] “unifications” that are unique to the [spiritual] elite who approach Hashem (<i>Exodus </i>19:22) and stream to His goodness (<i>Jeremiah </i>31:11).
And pious people and men of deeds connect this holy radiance to the joy of mitzvah [in order] to actualize the light within life.

Paragraph 503

[A person’s] deeds speak within [his] soul.
[A person’s] every action descends after multiple stages from the good, from the holy. In the same way that it wells forth from the holy wellspring—a holiness whose existence brought about its being, its revelation into actuality via an infinite series of cause and effect that devolved from the hidden height until this good deed came to be revealed in actuality—so too when it comes forth into actuality does it send the light back to its root.
It sends the waves back. It broadens the activity of holiness and expands it, from below to above.
And the opposite case is true as well:
Just as a polluted source brings into being every deed whose root is corrupt, so does [each such deed] reveal its sickness within the spirit [of the person] who commits it—until he comes to control his actions and his will, and uproots [that deed] from its source with the great power of teshuvah.
And then, when [that deed] is raised specifically to the trait of love, it establishes its dwelling-place in the depth of goodness. And [the deed] sends forth waves from below to above, in accordance with the laws that determine that good deeds will result in good.

Paragraph 504

Faith is the song of the supernal world. Its source is the Divine nature [found] in the depth of the soul, the delight of an inner perspective of an infinite happiness.
The demarcated Torah is built upon the final steps of this supernal song of holiness in its practical demarcation.
Those people who are filled with the glory of the song suffer at times from practical exactitude and its boundaries.
Nevertheless, because they know that the world exists with measured units, and that the foundation of the musical light too must be in accord with demarcated instruments, they receive [this] with love, and they draw the light of love and song into the demarcated sentences.
And by means of this patience they rise, and the world rises with them.
Precipitate people whose soul is unripe cannot bear the demarcation, and they are filled with rebellions.
But within the rebellion lives the pleasure of Hashem. And when the light of the messiah will be revealed, it will heal all of the insubordinations (cf. <i>Jeremiah </i>3:6). “The hearts of the sons will return to the fathers” (cf. <i>Malachi </i>3:24) “and your sons will be builders” (cf. <i>Berachot </i>64a) because “they will be taught by Hashem” (<i>Isaiah </i>54:13), Who has “founded the earth with wisdom” (cf. <i>Proverbs </i>3:19).

Paragraph 505

The pleasantness of Hashem appears like a small point in the hearts of those who gaze upon it, with all deeds resting upon [that point].
And all the effort of those who are great in awareness, those who truly love the good: it all rises in order to align the multitude of the many deeds and their complications with this inner, supernal point, so that [this point] will spread entirely with its light in all [of those deeds].

Paragraph 506

A person must carry out all the commandments with joy, because they open up the sense of sweetness and divine love that is hidden in the core nature of the soul.
Another good way to connect ourselves to this holy goal is to separate oneself from every sin, because sin thickens the light of the soul.
If [a person] acts in an ugly manner, spiritual clarity grows confused. Then there is an end to the expansion of the light of divine sweetness.
But [a person’s] consciousness must expand, in regard to both [his] actions and [his] spirituality, until the power of [his] soul grows so great that it has the strength to give an order to life (to life in general and to each individual life) in a fitting manner, so that the heavenly blossom of life, the universal sweetness which embraces all everlasting pleasures and from which all temporal pleasures are fed the pleasure of the sweetness of God, will blossom forever, flourishing and great.

Paragraph 507

Righteous people need not refrain from drawing forth the sweetness of the radiance of the delight of love of the pleasantness of Hashem upon all souls.
They must connect all their lives, spiritual and physical, to the center of this supernal kindness.

Paragraph 508

With the pleasurableness and sweetness of Hashem’s love and pleasantness, we sweeten all judgments in the entire world, and cause a flow of very plenteous blessing to repose in the Congregation of Israel. And the points of goodness grow increasingly pronounced from wherever they are immersed.

Paragraph 509

Freedom of thought in its conventional form is more the subjugation of thought than its freedom.
[That is] because, as a result of a person’s ardor for conventional freedom, he is distanced from the entire wealth of thoughts of truth that come from the great storehouses of supernal freedom of thought that have come to us as [our] inheritance.
The greatest [masters] of free thought are the paragons of the world who have redeemed themselves from all of the world’s spiritual and physical troubles and who have risen with their great power to redeem the entire world with their goodness.
[A person] must accustom [his] thought to [regard] everything new and everything old equally: to recognize everything in accordance with its level and not abandon the balance of the entire life of thought with all [other relevant] aspects [of life].
On that level and with such guidance, a person will reach the world of light, of absolute freedom, in which the supernal purpose of all existence is embedded. [That purpose is] to perfect that eminent creation: the spirit of man as it unites with the spirit of the entire world. And this recognition, which is the overall spirit of existence and the eminent active power in the soul of the world, becomes clearer to [a person] as it grows.
And the more [a person’s] spirit grows, the more his deeds grow, and the more his might intensifies.
And the full freedom of the heart of the people pure of spirit and the righteous people of the world teaches them that discerning what is new is always in accordance with the extent to which [one] discerns the old.
And all of the mishaps that affect a person and the world in the life of the spirit, and whose complications impede the glory of all life in all its details, result only when the heart of those people upon whose doorways the new is constantly knocking turns away from the old.

Paragraph 510

Intellectual and emotional righteousness is a special skill that a person who can [attain it] must constantly improve and develop.
It leads to practical righteousness, which is in the category of “work” and not in the category of a “skill” as advanced as emotion and intellect.
The happiness of the world depends on [a person’s] essence, on an abundant capacity for righteousness—which is the good heart and clear, inner comprehension of righteous people, who are the foundations of the world. [Our] nation, with the entire world, is strongly established on an abundance of the quality of righteousness.
When the song of justice grows and is blessed from its Divine source, it brings people eternal joy. And the closer a person is to the circle of spiritual righteousness, the more fulfilled he is.

Paragraph 511

The greatness of righteousness, along with its inner delight, comes from its ability to gaze toward the good of the future. No eras form a barrier before it. Everything that passes is like foam upon the water. All evil and ugliness that constrict our mind—all this passes by.
The entire universe is assured of eternalness. Even now, total goodness fills the world, and it is prepared to manifest itself openly on a variety of levels in the future.
When evolution—which is on every tongue—broadens its scope, it will be the source of all righteousness, honesty and holiness, and it will cause the divine sweetness to rest upon every soul.
The reason behind this is simple. Since everything is evolving toward goodness, everything is rising. And so everything is prepared for the feast and for complete goodness. Contentment with reality manifests, and supernal kindness is increasingly poured forth throughout all the fullness of the soul.
That is the goal of the tzaddikim’s trait of goodness. It fills them with love of God and with love of the world and all creatures.

Paragraph 512

Holy literature will necessarily spread. It must expand.
Every natural expression of the heart of holy thought, of free song, based on the foundation of the soul at its source, must be absorbed into the shelter of literature. And [it] will face the other. It will face all of the thoughts of wickedness of the impure soul in man, [the impure soul] that is crystallized in literature and befouls the world with its tainted breath.
A literature will come that wells from the source of a life of holiness, and will perfume the world. And as this perfume grows stronger, it will transform all of the miasma to good.
And all of the sparks of holiness, of goodness and happiness, that are scattered in the scummy stream of literature pouring from an impure source of the human spirit will make a single bond for good, for holiness and light.

Paragraph 513

The joy [that comes from] comprehension and holy feeling—which is joy in Hashem unique to the righteous, [joy] that has its unique character among [the people of] Israel—must be unpacked with all of its internal pathways, which are filled with light.
It must be explained in all of its slow gradations and all of its constant leaps. And it must be worked on by clear recognition and understanding.
In particular, there is place for literature to apply itself in emphasizing those states in which the joy of a practical mitzvah spreads expansively throughout the chambers of the heart and fills all of the capacities of life with practical might and power.
With that satisfied fulfillment, many lovely secrets appear. And cosmic mysteries, which are the subject of knowledge and eternal song, of a lucid worldview and a supernal philosophy, are revealed, are clarified [down] to their details and smallest details, until they are afterward transformed to constant, healthful sustenance for many souls and for healing the entire world from the illness of its apathy.

Paragraph 514

Whether or not erudition, which includes the Torah overall, has contributed to humanity’s happiness is the “stone of burden” (<i>Zechariah </i>12:3) about which thinkers disagree.
[Some] aspects point one way and [some] the other—and where is the meeting ground?
But they have forgotten to speak about the sexes, man and woman.
A man’s character is constructed to attain its satisfaction as a result of gaining culture and improving knowledge and skill. And a woman’s character is constructed to develop from within, without the toil of books. “Whoever teaches his daughter Torah is as though he teaches her mischief” (<i>Sotah </i>20a; Rashi and Rambam).
All types of damage in life—at least many of them—come from the fact that the man wants to “wear the garments of a woman”—to grow spontaneously like a plant of the field, in the spiritual and practical sense—and the woman desires to learn and to conquer.
Days will come when the world will recognize its distortion, and each sex will adhere to its own attribute. Then we will have a balanced human species, with the innate healthy nature from the side of the mother and the appearance of an active and seeking spirit from the side of the father—both of them comprising [humanity’s] beauty.

Paragraph 515

Within [a person’s] practical [halachah] learning spreads a hidden, life-[giving] dew of goals within the practical. When the soul learns, it is nourished by that hidden radiance.
However, if [a person’s] learning is not “for its own sake,” [if it is] for the sake of boastfulness and quarrelsomeness, [his] thought is emptied out and matters remain dry. And sometimes they are filled with an inner venom.
[On the other hand, if a person learns] with [at least] a rudimentary, undeveloped thought, although it is only based on a “a rote human commandment” (<i>Isaiah </i>29:13), some moistness of life flows in it, and it is protected to the extent that [his] learning in essence does not bend away from a search for the truth and uprightness [as it goes] on its way.
Intellectual distortion elicits all of those obstacles of the heart and dryness of the spirit, with the tendency to cling to poisoned ethics, in accordance with the extent of [a person’s] blemished thought [related to] the goal of [his] learning.
But sometimes [the learning] returns to good, if [a person’s] ethics-based affection for the holiness of [his] learning is the power that affects [his] feeling, [and] only because of [his] inadequate intellectual clarity had he been satisfied with twisted paths. In the end, such paths will be straightened out—at least, in their ethical sense.

Paragraph 516

The patriarchs rectified the Divine In-dwelling.
[Those] great souls who carried the future world in their heart felt themselves—themselves and all their character—to be a continuation of the Divine will in His world, which stamps His impression in the spirit of man, who perfects the inner being of existence with his ascent.
And from the soul of the forefathers, we draw forth the rays of light. We pray, we expand our elevated will—that which is elevated and uplifted, which is solely our Divine yearning [aspect]—in every prayer.
And we rectify all worlds as far as the root of our souls reaches.

Paragraph 517

A person’s mundane intellect gives him shadows and illusions, and with that it distances him from tangible reality.
The truth of reality gives a person Divine illumination, and with that it settles his world, and via his soul it perfumes the entire world.
It brings a person close to reality, to existence, to nature and to what is higher than nature. And every avenue adds light and life to its fellow [avenue].

Paragraph 518

Standard thought about love for God is that if, in consequence of [doing] something good in Hashem’s eyes a person would suffer eternal punishment, and in consequence [of doing] something evil he would attain eternal pleasure, he [should] choose the former and flee the latter.
The rationalists disagreed with that, because this is unreasonable, since the ultimate point is that which in itself brings pleasure and prevents suffering.
But they only saw the logic and not the reality.
Thought says only that when a person’s love for Hashem grows stronger, it brings him to such a state that no calculation in the world can conquer it, because calculation and logic do not conquer existence, but existence conquers them, since they themselves are only some tenuous revelations of the essence of full existence, [and] are considered before it as fine dust.

Paragraph 519

It is precisely thoughts of teshuvah that reveal the depth of [a person’s] will.
Through [thoughts of teshuvah,] the might of the soul is revealed in all of its splendor.
And in accordance with the extent of [a person’s] teshuvah, so is the measure of its freedom.

Paragraph 520

It would have been proper at the outset of [a person’s] apprehending the entire content of holiness that he derive [holiness] from the whole of humanity, because the recognition of holiness is universal, and the content of a person’s connection with Hashem transcends every nation. And afterwards [that connection] would have been drawn into a special Israelite “garment.”
But impairments in the entire world caused the whole of humanity to forget the foundation of holiness. It was [then] generated anew in Israel. For that reason, [a person’s] every holy thought must at the outset be drawn from the source of Israel.
Nevertheless, there are mighty people who find the foundation of the world that is in the root of the soul of Adam, which causes the heart of humanity as a whole to pulse. For them, the depth of this goodness takes priority over everything [else]. Afterwards, they take the distillation of this holiness and clothe it in the garments of the splendor of Torah and the commandments, with all of the special holiness by which Israel is distinguished, until they draw onto themselves [the state of] clinging to the Divine permeated by the light of Torah and joy in the commandments “because of such abundance” (<i>Deuteronomy </i>28:47).

Paragraph 521

Man is the distillation of all. He is related to the all. How is it possible that he will not have an effect on the all?
And the nation for whom clinging to the Life of all is all of its substance, and the paths of whose life flow from the One Who fills all, how will [this people] not raise everything?
They will fill the worlds with light. They will expand [the world of] Emanation; they will sustain [the world of] Creation with the emanated light; [the world of] Formation with the radiance of Creation; [the world of] Action with the glow of Formation. In worlds and in mankind, in every soul are joy and gladness: joy in the commandment[s] and the light of the Torah.
The inheritance of Jacob constantly rises in pride.
The nation that receives from the all, from the Source of the all, from that which is higher than all, vanquishes all, conquers when it is conquered, vanquishes when it is vanquished, is gathered when it is scattered, and rules when it is subjugated.

Paragraph 522

All ethics in the world are intermingled in every mitzvah, and all of the good in the world is intermingled in every strong ethical inclination—because how can it be good for a person if the treasury of ethics will not be prepared, in all its fullness, within his heart?
Even should people be strong, wise, wealthy, if they lack ethics, they will be immeasurably wretched.
And [this must be] ethics not as a pale impression, but penetrating ethics, ethics that fills all the crevices of the body, ethics that is drawn from the wellspring of life, ethics that combines all of the most variegated feelings of the soul into a single unit and establishes them all in their full character. That precisely is the ethics of life, which proceeds from the Source of life, which pulses in individuals from the wellspring of the nation, and in the nation from the Life of worlds. “The commandment of Hashem is clear. It illuminates the eyes” (<i>Psalms </i>19:10).

Paragraph 523

The holiness of [specific] times reveals the supernal good. [That] is all drawn from the source, the giving of thanks [associated with] the Sabbath: “[A song for the Sabbath day:] it is good to give thanks to Hashem” (<i>Psalms </i>92:1-2). [These times] are revealed on every holiday and festival as components of the supernal good. Therefore, joy finds its place in them, and delight increases overall.
[The nation of] Israel knows that Hashem is good. It knows about the hidden, precious [gift of the Sabbath] in the supernal treasury, the treasure-house of the Holy One, blessed be He (<i>Shabbat </i>10b).
The festivals reveal this knowledge. They elevate a person’s effectual power. They make him equivalent to his Maker in improving existence.
“All your males will appear” [at the Temple on each festival] (<i>Exodus </i>23:17)—[and the Sages comment,] “In the way that [the pilgrim] comes to see [Godliness], so does he come to be seen” (<i>Chagigah </i>2a).
[That refers to] two [types of] knowing: absolute good, from which joy and delight flow; and betterment, when a person betters everything. In his connection to all existence, he raises it. He improves it with the commandment of Hashem: insofar as he keeps the word of Hashem, and insofar as his mind and desire are connected to the desire of Hashem, “the supernal God, Maker of heaven and earth” (<i>Genesis </i>14:22).
Great is the light of kindness in the world. Great is joy in its [heavenly] abode. Great is the light and the [spirit of] eden where it camps.
Conversely, [however,] great is the abyss of darkness, the despair and the moaning.
[And so] a person takes lights of joy and greatness, and he scatters them in the abysses and states of darkness. They shine there, and they gladden a limitless multitude of creatures.
Immediately [these creatures] rise, and their lights with them, in an animated uplifting and flight, with song, melody and exhilaration to a place of light and edenic conditions. There, joy is added to joy.
And in the chambers of a person’s heart, in the sensibility of the singer within him, Edenic rivers and holy joys are revealed. The generosity of the spirit rises, the might of the soul gives praise, and everything is praiseworthy. Everything is embraced in love, birds sing, and children are filled with exuberance. The desolate of spirit are sobered, the broken of heart proceed and their depressions are bandaged, and the foundation of life pulses in the world.
The rich exquisiteness in everything depends on the flow of the freshness of a person’s internal desire for good, in his placing the seal of goodness on his spirit and on the entire character of his life.
Exceedingly many are the details of the good, intensified are the colors whose totality and details are underscored in the commandments, in Torah, in the expression of prayer and thanks, in the unifications of thought and unifications of [Divine] Names [engaged in by] the supernal holy ones, who are higher than all and who raise all.
“Happy is the nation that is like this; happy is the nation that has Hashem as its God” (<i>Psalms </i>144:15).

Paragraph 524

When, during <i>kedushah</i>, [the “holy…” section of the daily prayers], a person emulates the angels, he must imagine as well [that he possesses] their might and vital power. And then holiness intensifies, and it has positive might. He can rise from that to recognize the measure of his spiritual level, which rises higher than the sphere of the life of the angels.
And his heart will not at all frighten him that thinking this way might be weakness and exaggeration. Instead, the majesty of supernal holiness will pour over him, and he will rise and be uplifted. And the spirit of Hashem will encourage him to do great things, clothed in a spirit of holiness.

Paragraph 525

A person must always enrich himself with the details of spiritual wealth. [These] details are elevated in keeping with the measure of their fullness, wholeness and congruence, and they place a person in the chamber of the general principles where unity resides. [Then] he lives a life of truth, and he rises the mountain of Hashem.

Paragraph 526

Good souls, in whom the power of life and goodness is stored and who are prepared to increase goodness in the world, are always active. They always draw forth goodness and kindness, [and their] good will doesn’t act in vain.
Sometimes, they must be isolated and separated from evil souls, [souls] to whose essential will evil clings.
[These evil souls] cannot actually do evil, because ultimately “the Holy One, blessed be He, links [only] a good thought to a deed and not an evil thought to a deed” (<i>Kiddushin </i>39b-40a), and “the measure of good is always greater than the measure of punishment” (<i>Sotah </i>11a). Nevertheless, the current of good will is impeded by the evil thoughts that fill the heart of the wicked, those wretched people whose souls are ill. As a result of [this] isolation, the light of the good is intensified with such a great abundance that these good, supernal souls can heal the infirmity of the fallen souls, rectify them and elevate them.
The soul of [the people of] Israel overall requires isolation from the entire world to the [same] extent in order to guard the good within it. And the storehouse of [their] holy desire, filled with the light of wisdom [and] clothed in supernal kindness, will not rest from its work.
We take refuge in the shadow of a <i>succah</i>, in “the shadow of faith,” in the special shadow that isolates us from every nation with a sublime intensity that raises us above every nation. [That intensity] shone within us [in] the generation of the desert, “in a land where no one had passed” (<i>Jeremiah </i>2:6), in the wasteland of the world. There, we elevated all [human] habitation, all future improvements, with the power of the light of the inner desire of the inheritance of the patriarchs within us. “Hashem desired only your forefathers, He loved them, and He chose you, their seed after them, from among all of the nations, as it is this day” (<i>Deuteronomy </i>10:15), “to be His heritage people, as you are today” (ibid. 4:20).

Paragraph 527

The way that the Congregation of Israel relates to its individuals is different than the way that every [other] national group [relates] to its individuals.
All [other] national groups only give their individuals the exterior aspect of [their] identity. A person [in such a group] draws the essence of [his] identity [directly] from the Soul of the all, from the soul of God, not via [his national] group, because [that] group is not a Divine unit in which an independent Divine purpose resides.
[But] Israel is different. The soul of [each of its] individuals is drawn from the source of the Life of worlds [as it is] in the storehouse of the entire [nation], and the entire [nation] gives a soul to [its] individuals.
If [a Jew] would consider disconnecting [himself] from the nation, he would have to disconnect his soul from the source of its life force. Therefore each individual of Israel is enormously dependent on the entire [nation], and he [will] always give up his [life] rather than be torn away from the nation, because [his] soul and its individual rectification demand that of him.
The conduits that nurture the soul and that protect its life occur in the Congregation of Israel via the commandments, the word of Hashem. [They constitute] the general stream that is given form in [a person’s] way of life. [This way of life] has the imprint upon it of that program.
From “the head of the cliffs” (<i>Numbers </i>23:9), from the life of the patriarchs (<i>Bamidbar Rabbah </i>20:19), which spread and became explicit as the nation was established, the great spirit in which the light of Hashem resides was given form in the physical deeds that accompany [a person’s] life. The living storehouse [of the souls of Israel] bears the entire richness of life created by the [individual] soul, [created] by the intensification of the soul of the entire [nation] with the help of the individual who intensifies his strength, [with] the elevation of the entire [nation’s] soul as a result of the individual’s adding light to it by means of the seal that he stamps on [the nation’s soul] by [performing the] commandments.
[That] activity [of his] is a living activity, an activity that gives life and adds sturdiness and might.
The supernal world’s concealed mysteries—filled with victory and majesty, filled with mighty souls, filled with light and life, greatness, holiness and beauty—are brought into being with [a person’s performance of the] commandments.
[The mysteries] bring about their creations in the inner life of the individual and in the life of the entire [nation], and make elevated trails for them that proceed throughout the life of the world, so that the nation, which possesses great spiritual glory, relates to the entire world. The holiness rises and the form of humanity is filled with its light, and the worlds are filled [with] eternal joy from “the light of the Torah and the lamp of the commandments” (<i>Proverbs </i>6:23).

Paragraph 528

The worldview unique to Israel makes [that] nation a singular entity in the world (<i>Berachot </i>6a). That view is embedded in the Torah’s teaching of <i>creation ex nihilo</i>: “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth” (<i>Genesis </i>1:1).
This unique view leads to all of the practical commandments and the outstanding separateness of this nation. And [it leads to] the nation’s dependence on the Land of Israel as a land unique for it, where it may expand its spirit without interference, in parallel with [receiving] the help of all the characteristics ingrained in the atmosphere of the Land and its climate overall.
[This] unique view erects a shield against assimilation. And its effect is  brought to completion when it is crystallized in Torah and in the practical commandments, because then the Israelite soul is guarded from decay.

Paragraph 529

From the [fact that a person is] obligated [to engage in] action—in particular, to purify [his] body of evil deeds, including [eating] forbidden foods and [engaging in forbidden] actions—we learn how much the imaginative faculty must be attended to.
All of these [obligatory actions] are foundations for purifying the intellect, which builds its qualities upon [the basis of] a pure body with the powers of life within [the body]. These [powers of life] rise in a poetic way in the imaginative faculty, and they are [then] cleansed in a clear way in the spirit of [his] cognizance.

Paragraph 530

Truth is not revealed to a person segment by segment, but via an overall, sudden manifestation.
All of the exertion of a person’s learning, of the segments, is to prepare him for that overall manifestation.

Paragraph 531

When [a person’s] soul shines in a light greater than the ordinary, with an overall cerebral light, then the entire world, spiritual and material, receives a new form, brighter and more joyful.
This inner reality is the highest reality, [higher than] all tangible, exterior reality.
To elevate existence by elevating its inner being is the entire goal of the purified people with great souls who are in the world. And the entire desire of the Congregation of Israel is cloaked and concealed in this secret.

Paragraph 532

When Divine inspiration pulses in a person, he begins to feel the soul of the Torah: how it spreads in all of the halachahs and aggadahs.
And through the particular [topics] that he is [studying], he derives the dew of life from the secret of [that] soul overall.

Paragraph 533

Prayer comes to clarify the will. The animal spirit is mixed into the human spirit, and by pouring forth the soul [in prayer], we raise the human spirit so that it will stand in its purity without the admixture of the dregs of the animal soul.

Paragraph 534

We comprehend reality as an existence that starts from its source, first descending from above to below, from a supernal identity to a lowly identity, until it reaches the humblest descent. After that, it turns to ascend. It ascends from its humble descent at the bottommost depth to the most elevated ascent, ascending to its source in [the realm of] supernal concealment.
In this framework, reality in all of its forms is well-understood.
It is understood that a supernal power rules [reality] to raise it, [something that] already began when [reality] was in its source, before its descent.
And the development that is felt from below to above is [the realization of] the [prophetic] vision of the steps of return of all reality.

Paragraph 535

Skepticism about [the ability to] know [anything comes] close to denying all reality, because [with that skepticism a person] has no basis [upon which] to verify any concepts.
Certainty vanquishes [skepticism] in its war with it. Nevertheless, [certainty] is constantly being thrown off balance to return to its [former state of] skepticism. From all of this, [skepticism] appears to have a foundation in reality, which indicates [skepticism] to be strong because [a human being’s] intellect is unsettled.
In truth, falseness in its totality is an absolute nullity.
[However,] as beings finite in [our] realm, [such] a depth of nullity is impossible for us to comprehend.
For us, [therefore,] every nullity clothes itself in a form of some existent. And evil derives its strength from that fantasy.
[But] when the absolute truth will be revealed, it will grow clear that falsehood has no reality—and, how much more, that none of its branches exist.
Skepticism proclaims—[although] it does not know what it is proclaiming—that the evil aspect of existent [is a nullity].
[Skepticism] knows the aspect of reality that is in truth absolute nullity—the evil aspect [of reality], which is nothing but a shadow, the delusion of falsehood, which is an absolute nullity.
And when the skeptical approach will be well-developed, it will attain its purpose: to illuminate the world in the light of its negating [falsehood].

Paragraph 536

When the supernal wisdom is revealed in a person, no blemish can exist in his will, nor [even] in the depths of the nature of his flesh.
When this wisdom appears, there is no foreskin at all. [Thus,] “Adam was created circumcised” (<i>Avot Derebbi Natan </i>2:5).
The will is blemished [only] after the concealment of [that] brilliant wisdom, and it [then] grows apparent that will and wisdom are two [separate] matters. [But] that is the revelation of an error, because in truth they are one entity and identity.
And just as the supernal wisdom is brilliant in its true being, so is it clear in its goodness, in terms of the aspect of the will within it.

Paragraph 537

It is a great lack in a person’s makeup that when he glances at supernal thoughts he immediately loses his alignment with the sensory world and all of its senses. And that situation causes the person to be distanced from supernal elevation.
[Instead,] a person must acquire the trait of might in his spirit and love the sensory world with all of its acquisitions and all of its societal obligations, even as he glances upward far beyond all that relates to them, and he yearns for a more brilliant and more supernal light than anything that shines openly in this world. And then he will grow accustomed to [being in] a state in which the world and everything in it will not be something that oppresses his soul.
And the supernal light’s concealment from the wisdom as it manifests itself and from [a person’s] yearning for the good will not be as coarse as it is in the usual way, in which the world is a complete opponent to the spiritual light, which seeks its way in a life of supernal freedom.

Paragraph 538

Divine inspiration, [a level lower than prophesy,] comprehends everything through a moral lens.
But <i>absolute</i> morality, which provides a universal perspective—[and] which, [promulgated by God,] founds a world, builds a world, and manages a world, a world in its full sense, comprising the aggregate of all worlds—is something higher than any trait of morality that any thought can imagine.
[A person’s] supernal gaze at the absolute trait of morality, which is the foundation of the righteousness of all the worlds, is so vastly radiant that it darkens all of the small traits of morality, so that a person who has not armed himself with the weapon of the war of Hashem can fall into the hands of those who hate his soul, who lay in wait for him upon the path of life, which requires [a person to maintain] a measured, world-[delimited] morality.

Paragraph 539

Looking with wisdom leads to holiness.
[A person’s] desire is drawn after [his] awareness. When [his] awareness rises, when it refines itself from the depth of its foundation, it finds [in itself] a world filled with a yearning for holiness, [a world that] branches out infinitely from all of [the awareness’s] aspects. And [that awareness] within [this world] is engrained as a central point within an infinitely expansive circle.

Paragraph 540

When [people] think about matters of Godliness, everything is elevated. All of [their] traits are elevated, and as a result of the elevation of [their] traits, [their] actions are elevated. And because the vast delight that is concealed in the radiance of the Godliness is revealed in [that] life of thought, all of the worlds are elevated. And from there, [the delight flows] via conduits of life to all existence.
[Their ability to think about Godliness] is the measure of the righteous people, who maintain the world with their holy thoughts, who pour life onto all living beings.
They rise with a great elevation above the entire world, and they raise the world and everyone in the world with the elevation of their thought, which sprinkles a moistness of eternal life upon everything.
No one comprehends the power of these mighty people, but that does not at all diminish the loveliness of their radiance. And they are the soul of life. They live with the full Godly love, which encompasses in an inclusive form all of the details of being, without the need to decrease [that] awareness and descend to [the details’] depths. [That is] because from their heights they manifest light—onto everything exalted and onto everything lowly. And [in that] they have [something] of the attribute of their Maker.

Paragraph 541

When we look at the radiance of the Divine wisdom, which crowns all of life, we feel total expansiveness and freedom. And how hard is the constriction must come for the sake of all matters of life, even the spiritual among them.
But how much power, and how much light and life, are revealed specifically through that constriction, when it comes together with the expansiveness and light. It descends with a supernal power, flung [down] to the depths of the depths. Then, filled with all, every constriction will rise to the eternal heights, and it will add many lights with the fullness of all as it ascends.

Paragraph 542

The more the Divine thought intensifies in a person and the more it penetrates into his essence, [the more] it purifies all of his traits and all of his deeds with such a supernal purification that none of the clarifications resulting from any other moral manifestation can compare to it.
The righteous person who loves Hashem is truly the foundation of the world. With his ascent, the entire world ascends; and he feels the ascent of the entire world from within himself, from his inner being. From his flesh he will see, and from his soul he will understand.

Paragraph 543

The radiance that exists in every deed and every matter when it is illuminated by the Divine light elevates, sanctifies, strengthens, refines, and satiates all goodness.
When the manifestation of holiness intensifies as a result of the intensification of [a person’s] thought in the holy heights, all sparks of goodness are correspondingly magnified. From all of the commandments, supernal, wondrous luminosities appear, delighting the heart and gladdening the soul in the brilliance of their eternal vitality. And from [a person’s] every worldly act, from every movement and every yearning of the heart, a lovely splendor, which entirely expresses glory, is revealed.
When [this glory] rises, as a result of the thought of righteous people, it rises with “great honor” (<i>Daniel </i>2:6).
And there is no end to the happiness of the entire world that results from the expansion of the heart of supernal righteous people, whose affection for life is a holy affection that comes from an outpouring of the soul with might and strength for the Source, the Life of all living beings, “a throne of glory, elevated from the beginning, the place of our Sanctuary” (<i>Jeremiah </i>17:12), the splendor of the House of our Life.

Paragraph 544

All of the worlds in their entirety [receive their] life [force] from the spirit of Hashem. Their power [is] filled with the life [force] of absolute justice and complete uprightness.
And a human being must with his free will establish the content of his life so that it will be congruent with the Life of all worlds.
That is the secret of the might [that exists] in [a person’s] fear of heaven: [the fact] that the entire strength of all the worlds assists a person who appraises his path before Hashem.
And the more intense a person’s purification of [his] soul, the more intense the demand within him to be congruent with the light of the Life of all worlds. It spreads across all of his actions, ways, movements, and acquisitions, until it becomes impossible for any mishap to come about, not even through his animal (<i>Yevamot </i>99b).

Paragraph 545

Imagination is the shadow of the intellect. And sometimes it is higher than the intellect—not intrinsically, but because it is a sort of material that receives illumination from the supernal light.
Therefore, there are two special, separate qualities in imagination: its quality of being the shadow of the intellect, and its quality of receiving illumination.
From the aspect of its being the shadow of the intellect, it is original. It has this power in its essence. However, it is diminutive in quality, because in the end it is only the reflection of the intellect. It certainly has all of the weaknesses of the intellect, and in addition it has new weaknesses added to it, in keeping with the diminution of existence that exists between the essence of the intellect and that which is its shadow.
But the power of its receiving is capable of receiving very elevated phenomena. It has the drawback that it is not original, but a sort of vessel to receive that which is given into it. But on the other hand, that which it receives it receives from a source that is so supernal and exalted that it does not at all need to take the weaknesses of the intellect into account.

Paragraph 546

The elevation of the imagination comes whenever it clings to holiness. But the mundane imagination only possesses the power of the shadow, and it is the source of derisiveness.
To the degree that [mundane imagination] is removed from [its] source in the intellect, and in keeping with its intensification, reality weakens for it. [A person’s] spirit that is immersed in [mundane imagination] suffers at the beginning [of that immersion] and is extirpated at its end.
The healing for the world deeply immersed in the shadow aspect of imagination is not the weakening of the imagination nor the intensification of the intellect alone—which in the end is also constricted—but imagination’s return to the supernal source, from which it is capable of receiving the might of its complete life [alt.: “its Tree of Complete Life”]. And with that, the intellect too will be helped, [so that] its shadow aspect—which is engraved in the depths of the imagination—will come to the practical aid [of the intellect].

Paragraph 547

What is the process of the elevation of the world?
[The realm of] supernal <i>atzilut</i> (“emanation”) is entirely good. [Then] there are many descents, following which comes the quality of the intellect, whose goal is to develop [itself] and rise to supernal <i>atzilut</i>, [to be] embedded in [<i>atzilut’s</i>] absolute truth and goodness.
After the intellect embeds the nature of [the realm of] <i>atzilut</i> in itself, it casts away many of its limited qualities. [That is] comparable to the casting away of the placenta from the newborn after it emerges into the atmosphere of the world.
[Then] feelings rise up to the intellect, just as the intellect [rose] to the [realm of] <i>atzilut</i>, higher than itself.
When the feeling rises to intellectual purification, it loses some of the coarse qualities in its nature.
And the same applies to the [next realm, where there is a] blending and material tendencies. [That realm undergoes a process] corresponding to that [undergone by the] feelings, which are higher than [these tendencies].
[All of] this takes place not only in the human being but in the entire world. The elevation of coarser nature proceeds upon its course by means of transactions of levels: from nature to blending, from blending to feeling, from feeling to intellect, [and] from intellect to <i>atzilut</i>.
The concealed will of those who are holy of spirit is filled with the desire that everything will rise to [the realm of] supernal <i>atzilut</i>, which itself also rises with endless elevations—which [even] the eye[s] most fully equipped with spiritual glasses grow too dim to see.
Still, as the overall radiance of [these holy people’s] most elevated yearning pulses, it affects [their] every action and every thought, every movement, and every shift [in their] lives, [as they] live a life of truth and they unceasingly derive the quality of their life from the supernal radiance. And as a result of the elevation of their yearning as they rise, they raise the entire world with all of its affairs.

Paragraph 548

Existence descended initially from its heavenly height to the depths of its depths. And out of that, it is prepared to rise from all of its descents to the source of its root.
And just as its ascent [occurs] in slow increments, so too its descent was in increments, and the chief supernal lights were disconnected little by little from the totality of their supernal light in the supernal [realms].

Paragraph 549

There is an inner demand in a person’s heart that all of the revelations of his life must have an eternal character, that they must in no way fear any displacement, any extirpation and obliteration. And with that, he strides beyond the essence of time.
However, this demand can only be realized in the supernal way of holiness of being absolutely immersed in the Divine light—which, with the power of universal secrets within itself, provides a function in this world for every spiritual and physical movement, and provides directive for every smallest matter to the great heights.
But together with that, a person must not forget that he is connected to a finite world in which there is differentiation between large and small, light and dark, mundane and holiness, impure and pure.
And he must always yearn [to attain] greatness, light, holiness, and purity, and to transform with an infinite power hidden within his eternal character smallness and darkness, the mundane and the impure, to greatness and light, holiness and purity.
And when a person perceives that everything has the power to be transformed to supernal good, he grows settled in his mind, he is accepted by people, he is happy in his world, and he is sanctified with supernal sanctity. And he strolls in the lands of life—in all senses—before Hashem always.

Paragraph 550

There are a number of [ways] of ascending [via] which a person and the world can ascend.
The first [way] is [ensuring] that a situation should not remain static, but that it should move from its place upward. That only rescues [the situation] from descending, since it is actually impossible for [a situation] to remain static.
The second [way] is that each coming movement should always be stronger than the previous one. With that, the ascent continues and shines more.
The third [way] is that each movement should be double the one before it. And so the doubling proceeds without end, with each movement including everything of the essence and innovation of the movements before it, until each new moment of life has a worthier and higher quality than all of [one’s] previous life. And “better is one hour in teshuvah and good deeds in this world than the entire life of the world to come” (<i>Avot </i>4:17).

Paragraph 551

Knowledge in itself—to know Hashem, or also to know the Divine oneness—is not yet the completion of the work of knowledge. [That is only reached] when [knowledge] gives forth its fruit [and a person] establishes [his] life in accordance with the knowledge. And then [life] is elevated, intensified, and sanctified.
Indeed, there is a wondrous quality in the true knowledge of God, which is that it gives its fruit and it influences life for the good. However, [this is] not without work but via constant, uninterrupted learning—for the elite few on their level and for the entire [nation] on its level, and all of those who mold [the nation], from generation to generation. “Generation to generation will praise Your deeds, and Your pious ones will bless You” (<i>Psalms </i>145:4).

Paragraph 552

Those who argue on behalf of nature and the freedom of man forget that the spirituality in man and in the world also has a nature, and it too seeks its freedom. And the freedom of its spirituality and its nature is the basis of morality and the Torah.

Paragraph 553

There is a holiness that builds and there is a holiness that destroys. The goodness of the holiness that builds is revealed, and the goodness of that which destroys is hidden, because it destroys in order to build that which is more exalted than that which was already built.
A person who apprehends the secret of holiness that destroys can rectify a number of souls, and in keeping with the extent of his apprehension, so is the greatness of the power of his rectifying.
From the destroying holiness emerge the great warriors who bring blessing to the world: the level of Moses, master of the strong hand, who shattered the Tablets.

Paragraph 554

When we pray, the will rises.
And the will is the fundamental concentrate of life. Therefore, all of life and existence rise as a result of the ascent of the will, until everything is refined, and everything is sweetened.
The sweetening reaches the bottommost depths and even those condemned to Gehennom rest, because the appearance of the kindness and goodness of the prayer sweetens all the evil, with all of its roots and branches.

Paragraph 555

Spiritual pain comes from a lack of coordination between feelings and the intellect.
The soul is constantly concerned with perfecting itself with great illumination, until the paths of feeling—and the tendencies of [feeling’s] spiritual and bodily nature—will correlate with supernal intellectual illumination and with what is higher than that: the manifestation of holiness, of holy visions, which come from a high level transcending human intellect. [And that will happen] after [the intellect] is perfected and purified.

Paragraph 556

If not for the equivalency [that exists across] existence, no wisdom could unfold.
And since the spiritual [part of] Creation is so estimable and wisdom does so much to vitalize everything, the order [characterizing] all reality must necessarily possess an equivalence [among its] levels so that one part [of reality] casts light on another, and [one] detail [casts light] on the totality, the physical [casts light] on the spiritual, and the imagination [casts light] on the intellect.
And from [the reality captured by] this overview emerge wellsprings filled with supernal knowledge, which unite [elements that are] separate and bring near [to each other elements that are] distant [from each other].
However, the greatness of [this] equivalence is actualized by means of [a person’s] recognition of the division between each level. [That] dividing unit [of reality] is what clarifies the depth of the equivalence.

Paragraph 557

The nature of the body is entirely a concentrate of the nature of practical [reality], which is a concentrate of the spiritual nature above it.
The constant manifestation of the spiritual, [which is] the consequence of [a person’s] clear gaze, raises the nature of [his] body to its source. [The nature of his body] is [then] refined and sanctified, and its consequences—in the individual’s [life] and in overall life—appear [and] illuminate all the darknesses of the world.
At the time of [that] gaze, the essence of the nature of the [person’s] body rises to a height more elevated than it is at the time of [his] intellectual obscurity. And afterwards, when [the nature of his body] returns to its place after [his] gaze, it returns perfumed and filled with good.

Paragraph 558

When a person is far from elevated insights that speak of very abstract and exalted matters in terms of a lack of morality in him, so that his will is not on the level of being able to truly desire this elevated goodness, the insights themselves appear in a blurred form.
That is the meaning [of the concept] that all holy learning must be preceded by teshuvah.
The noble aspect that accompanies every action and certainly all learning appears only in keeping with the level of the purity of [a person’s] will and might.
And in keeping with that, there is an introductory requirement for personal ethics and purity even for the most practical studies and for every act in the world, since they all live [in tandem with] the noble spiritual revival within them.

Paragraph 559

The good “husk,” the husk in holiness that is compared to the bark of cinnamon, which has a sweet and good taste, is revealed in all of the paths of a simple education that straightforwardly explains Torah and faith, the reasons for the commandments and the entire influence of holiness.
Although [such an] explanation is on a small level, lacking the greatness and exaltedness that exists in the depths of [Kabbalistic] secrets, it is still very estimable, worthy of being established as a component of learning, and of being worked to align it with the body of deeper commentary and of the more inward secrets of the world.
A simplistic discourse explains everything in accordance with the foundation of human imagination, [man’s] intellect and his morality, the yearnings of his heart and the impressions made by his routine, whether of the individual or of the public. A great many matters of the “material”—[the commandments]—of the Torah are explained in this way.
A person must accommodate himself to the revealed aspect in all of its depth, in its beauty and its goodness, and bind it to a more penetrating and inward gaze, [to] the holy discourse of supernal secrets.

Paragraph 560

The righteous person must be familiar with himself. If he knows that his pride comes from the source of holiness, that he takes pride in the sovereignty of the King of all worlds and he glories in His glory, it is forbidden for him to nullify this holy pride under the influence of small-[minded] lowliness. Rather, he should purge that pride of all dross by means of the manifestation of the light of greatness, and [that pride] will unite with the absolute humility.

Paragraph 561

Details of halachot proliferate from [their spiritual] roots. And [those] roots are [in turn] necessarily [the product of] the roots of their roots.
[A person’s] every fulfillment and keeping of a practical detail [of halachah] expands and illuminates the appearance of light from the supernal root. In accord with the logical connection unique to that component [that is the individual root], these details are connected to the [higher,] shining root.
And every [incorrect] transference and spoilage damages and seals those conduits of light—everything in accord with the extent of the quality and quantity of that spoilage.
And this natural sealing has its effect. [This occurs] whether [a person acted] in error or willfully, intentionally or unintentionally, [the effect being] on [correspondingly] different levels.

Paragraph 562

When the supernal trait of goodness gains strength within the heart and a person is filled with kindness and forgiveness, no alien idea constricting that goodness and kindness may halt this holy process. From these moments of illumination, divine inspiration spreads throughout the world.
And from the absolute good that shines into one soul in great measure, all souls (small and great, distant and near) are sweetened.

Paragraph 563

When the trait of goodness and kindness gains strength in the heart of the tzaddik (the foundation of the world), it arrives, with its light, to the profundity of the most distant future, the most elevated world of rectification, where all that is bitter will be sweetened, and all evil will be transformed to good and all darkness to light. This [tzaddik] transcends all the deeds and constructs of the present world.
[In this world,] the trait of judgement prevents and blocks goodness from expanding in all its fullness. But this good tzaddik always overcomes everything. He clings to his trait of goodness, which is the trait of the supernal good that is constantly being revealed to him from that light which has been hidden away for the tzaddikim in future days.
This is because, due to the depth of his goodness, he does not hold himself back from pouring forth upon [the deeds and constructs of the present world] a very broad outflow that is good for them.
This accords with the good desire of his inner being to be good and of aid both to those who are evil and those who are good.

Paragraph 564

From the well of kindness, [a person’s] love for humanity must burst forth not as an order given by a Commander, for then it would lose the most clear aspect of its brilliance, but as a powerful movement of the spirit.
This love must withstand very difficult challenges. It must overcome many contradictions, which are scattered like boulders upon which you may stumble. These are found in isolated Torah statements, in the superficial aspect of some Torah laws, and in a multitude of points of view that stem from the constriction within the revealed aspect of the Torah and the national ethical sense.
It is clear that when the love of humanity grows remote from its divine source, its blossom withers.
And the divine source expresses its light through the conduits of Torah and deed, and through the unique constriction of the [Jewish] nation.
All this requires great effort of the spirit: how to maintain these conduits where they stand, and yet draw the waters of kindness in their original purity and breadth.
We must descend repeatedly to the depths of darkness in order to excavate precisely from there the most liberated, greatest and most elevated light.

Paragraph 565

One must always yearn for the greatest salvation of the people. That [consists of] the elevation of the worlds and all of the souls dependent on them from the depths of evil and chaos. [It comes about] by means of the individual’s elevation from his depths to his heights, until he will become similar to his Maker, creating worlds with his speech and his will (<i>Midrash Tehillim </i>116).
It is true that now as well it is said of the righteous, “You decree and it comes about for you” (<i>Job </i>22:28). But that is only a small spark of the future light that will spread in all the fullness of all souls.
It is impossible to imagine the greatness of the joy, beauty, and wealth in this. All of the righteous yearn for and desire this great light, and they rejoice in it always. [That is] because the entire deed of Hashem exists always. It is established and stands ever above every boundary and all of time.
“Those who know Your Name will rejoice in You, because You have not abandoned those who seek You, Hashem” (<i>Psalms </i>9:11).
Although there is no power in any soul at present to contain this great light, nevertheless, through righteous people’s great longing for and supernal conceptualizing (<i>sha’er</i>) of the majesty of Hashem, in the secret of “her husband is known in the gates (<i>sha’ar</i>)” (<i>Proverbs </i>31:32; <i>Zohar </i>1:103b), they draw onto themselves and onto the entire world many lines in the form of hairs (<i>se’ar</i>) (<i>Etz Chaim</i> 13:8) filled with abundance, light, and life [that come] from the great light of the “elderliness” of all the worlds, so that [the people] will be filled with [the lines’] light and radiance, [in the people’s] mind and good desire. “In the light of the countenance of the King is life” (<i>Proverbs </i>16:15). “Happy are all those who wait for Him” (<i>Isaiah </i>30:15).

Paragraph 566

We must refine the fear of heaven, [which is] the locus of supernal Divine faith, from all its dross, from all the moral and intellectual dross that a person and all finite intelligence in existence mixes into it.
And the greatest refining occurs when it is revealed to [a person’s] eye that there is no dross, that everything is life and good, and it is only [his] that values must be properly attuned. The utilitarian aspect must be in its correct measure in everything, whether physical or spiritual. And the intellectual aspect must be that [a person] will exert himself to know how to evaluate everything. And then “there is no Satan and there is no evil misadventure” (<i>Kings </i>I 5:18).

Paragraph 567

Those who are great in knowledge are filled with sufferings, because the populace does not make it possible for them to express their great thoughts.
These sufferings and this dread of the populace is not due to their being afraid that the populace will harm their body or their money, their honor or anything they have. It is not fitting for a person to enter among the regiment of the pure of thought—who are truly the great of mind—if he has not yet vanquished all of these lowly fears.
Rather, these lights of the world fear the populace because of their love for it and because of the great moral responsibility in their souls.
They are afraid that they might harm the overall populace, that they might detract from its morality, that they might damage its cohesiveness by giving it such great goodness whose light [the people] cannot absorb and cannot benefit from [on the level of] the expression of the great thoughts of these great people in their purity—that the populace is always liable to spoil the goal [of these great people] and misapprehend the form [of their character], and understand them in such a distorted manner that the flow of this light is liable only to break their small vessels and destroy the measure of limited good that they grasp in accord with their measure.
However, over and above that, the desire to bestow and benefit does not allow [these great people] rest.
The full light in [such a person’s] soul presses him and tells him: “Bestow!” And the person who has this holy destiny as his destiny is constantly given over to the sufferings of the righteous—which, with all their bitterness, scour his body and burnish his soul more than all tormenting sufferings of body and soul in the world.

Paragraph 568

The Congregation of Israel vanquishes the world with its spiritual power, whose foundation is absolute moral elevation, [something] that surpasses the propensities in the spirit of human beings, even the best and finest among them.
[The Congregation of Israel] reveals its power in [its] knowledge that the world is [under] guidance that transcends the way of nature. It explains its essential character [as being due to] miracles and wonders. And this truth itself intensifies the spiritual might within [the Congregation of Israel] and within the world.
It is impossible for a human being—as an individual or in the aggregate—to rise above his nature when he constantly thinks that everything embedded in nature does not have over it a supernal power that can elevate it.
Therefore, neither for idolaters nor for absolute atheists is there any escape from the moral lowliness in the depth of the spirit.
The only thought that strengthens the spirit to raise it from all of the deficiencies in a person’s barbaric animal nature is faith-related thought, which clarifies its effects by means of the dominion of the name of Hashem in the world, bringing about with His will an ideal revelation: the revelation of the name of Hashem in the Torah of Israel.

Paragraph 569

The heresy that will spread across the entire world (<i>Sanhedrin </i>97a) prior to the great supernal light that will manifest itself over [that heresy] is like “the void prior to being” (Maharal, <i>Netzach Yisrael</i>) in the entirety of existence.
Therefore, even the ancient spiritual form of faith must decay and putrefy. “The wisdom of the scribes will putrefy” (<i>Sotah </i>49b).
And after that putrefaction, the new form begins. “After an egg ‘putrefies,’ the form [of the embryo] takes shape” (<i>Temurah </i>31a).
And a supernal chick emerges, a kosher bird, which finds a home in the nest of the supernal bird, “where the Holy One, blessed be He, and a poor person [the messiah (<i>Peirush Hasulam</i>)]<i> </i>dwell” (<i>Zohar </i>1:6a).

Paragraph 570

It is impossible for any overall restoration to last, unless it turns its face to bind itself with all of the good in the world. And that is comparable to an individual in his private life, who is wise only when he learns from everyone (<i>Avot </i>4:1). So [too] and even more so, that is what the people must do.

Paragraph 571

There are a multitude of thoughts that by their nature cannot stand side by side. They contradict each other—not necessarily from their logical aspect but in the effects that they have on the [person’s] will and on [his] emotions.
Only with outstanding spiritual might can a person attain the measure that no contradiction will prevent him from giving his heart proper rest and alignment [with any contradiction]. And he will not fear any storming up of various thoughts, which create a ferment when they encounter each other.

Paragraph 572

The Rambam’s “necessary” beliefs [(postulates necessary for people to believe in order to sustain them on a path of truth; <i>Guide to the Perplexed</i> III 28)] are the ways through which we establish the style [of our faith]. And they are embedded in human nature, such that it is completely impossible for a person to uproot these belief-images from his heart without uprooting the supernal truths that are the foundation of absolute truth.
All that being said, in every generation many changes come about in [our] relation to these necessary beliefs. But the inner truth stands forever.

Paragraph 573

Because a person’s mind is too small to encompass the overall aspect of various perspectives and their unifying scope, each of all of the various generations and societies returns to its own horizon of outlooks that are robust in its own spirit. And everyone imagines that there is no hope for it to be built up unless the other outlook, which is not that of the viewer’s faction, will be eliminated.
And no one broadens [his] mind, saying that the entire world cannot be viewed from one perspective [only], but [that only] a part of it [can be so viewed].
That being the case, every [perspective] is needed, and everything constructs a building. And the contradictions do not come from the aspect of that which exists and that which is positive in the outlooks but from [the outlooks’] negative aspect, from the prideful stumbling blook of “I will rule and no other,” which [the proponent of] each outlook has taken in his time and for his faction.

Paragraph 574

A person who is capable of [experiencing] true fear of heaven, piety and holiness must know that it is entirely impossible for him to be like everyone [else], but he must exert himself to hold firm to his special character.

Paragraph 575

The true holy person of righteousness unifies within himself all opposites and all of the good that is scattered in the world. In a state of smallness, each [piece] contradicts the other. [But] when they meet on one level, in one vessel, he unifies them with his great power, which is encompassing and extensive.
[That is] because he rises constantly in his thought and will to the supernal, spiritual world where there are no straits and everything can enter, and so all of the good can gather together. And with his supernal power he causes the good that is scattered in all of the individuals in Israel and in the entire world and in all of the worlds to assemble.
Regarding this trait, there are levels beyond inquiry.
And the most supernal person of righteousness encompasses the most inclusive expanse. He has no constriction of judgment, but he is instead filled with kindness and vast compassion, and he truly desires the good of all. He loves to vindicate all people, and he hates to condemn and incriminate them.
However, the world cannot recognize the measure of this justice, and so every supernal righteous person must clothe his supernal righteousness in many garments, so that after they diminish the light people can benefit from it.

Paragraph 576

The entire desire of the truly righteous person is to truly cling to Godliness, [something] that transcends every idea and thought, and is elevated beyond every limited and circumscribed aspiration.
When he afflicts his soul by withholding from [his soul what] it powerfully yearns for, because he is preoccupied with and engaged in finite matters, which are mundane matters for him, that affliction is felt in a great many worlds, and a multitude of souls without number are pained with his inner pain.
Afterwards, when the gates of light are opened and he does teshuvah out of love, and the light of the joy of Divine inspiration flames and shines upon him, then with a joyous sound of a great roar, of universal joy, many souls are lifted from their depths, and many worlds with heaven and earth in them are filled with might and joy.
“When the righteous become great, the nation rejoices” (<i>Proverbs </i>29:2).

Paragraph 577

When righteous people strengthen themselves with their intrinsic holiness, so that the light of kindness shines in them with great brightness, they can summon to repent even the most resolved wicked people, even those immersed in all of the contaminations and “husks,” even the most terrible atheists and insolent people, because everything longs for the supernal light when it is revealed.

Paragraph 578

A simple understanding of the Divine greatness glows upon and brilliantly illuminates the soul of the righteous person, who constantly yearns for the supernal light to shine upon him and upon the entire world.
Whenever [that] supernal glow shines its light upon him, just as he is filled with an abundance of happiness, so too all levels, from the beginning of the source of happiness to the depths of the core of the feelings of his soul, are filled with delight and holy happiness.
And all of the levels below the point of what his soul [can] feel also rise, and silently some inner joy and gratification filled with goodness enters there, and everything is blessed and refined.
And the wickedness, evil, ugliness, commotion, darkness and turmoil in existence diminish, wither away and shrivel, and many parts of it are transformed, in keeping with [their] closeness to their root, into the light of goodness, uprightness, tranquility, holiness and blessing.
“And a person will say, ‘Yes, there is reward for the righteous person. Yes, there is a God Who judges on earth” (<i>Psalms </i>58:12).

Paragraph 579

Faith gives purpose to existence, and knowledge [provides] the ways to recognize and attain [that purpose].
If a person is negligent in straightening out [his] ways, the purpose will be hidden from him.
And if he ceases to yearn for the purpose, all of the ways will lose their value, and in the end they will be distorted.
The knowledge aspect of faith is always on the level of [providing] a path leading to the purpose. And the faith aspect of knowledge is the purposeful value of the path.

Paragraph 580

When the world comes to err, thinking that it has already attained the goal, which is faith, it immediately begins to turn aside from [faith]. [That is] because the goal, faith, is far from [the world], and [faith’s] goodness and happiness, truth and refuge are hidden in [faith’s] supernal hiding place.
As a result of this careless [approach to] the content [related to] the goal, the ways of knowledge start to be distorted, and “the wisdom of the scribes putrefies” (<i>Sotah </i>49b), and a person feels that he is losing his joyful spiritual possessions.
From the height of the supernal goal from which his soul is quarried, the living current within him pushes him to repeatedly return. He is gradually purified [and] he gradually returns, until he comes back to the height of faith.

Paragraph 581

There is a good content in the world that constantly rises. And that content is revealed as well in a person’s will and nature.
In the past, human nature and will were more primitive than they are at present. And in coming days, they will be more peaceful and good than they are at present.
In the past, the character of the Torah and ethics focused especially on nullifying the power of the natural will, because the evil in [the will] was copious.
And in the future, [this] matter [will] receive a new form. Finally, [a person’s] search for freedom of the will [will] make moral demands [on him] that will allow [this search to attain] its desired expansion, so that the significant amount of goodness hidden in it will grow evident.
But at present, a number of dregs in the will still exist. As a result of the merit of the good sparks of the will that have risen, these dregs too desire to attain freedom. [But] their freedom would destroy the world and pollute it.
Thus, the war is mighty, and each camp protects [itself] with justification, and battles with justification.
Non-religious people battle on behalf of the good sparks of the will so that they will not suffer unnecessary slavery, which only causes lack.
And people subservient [to the Torah], who recognize the past and know it with the splendor of its goodness, protect that subservience so that the polluted parts of the will will not destroy the world’s noble construction.
And those with a great spirit must reconcile the combatants, showing each the boundary truly relevant for him.

Paragraph 582

If the believers in Torah truly acknowledge the great principle of the denial of corporeality, finiteness and changes [in God], and of all of the descriptions spoken by human beings about God, they must necessarily proceed on a path of intelligent faith.
And since [this] one point of faith with intelligence is necessary, it is necessary that the entire world be intelligent. Wisdom and faith must proceed, bound together. Without knowledge, there is no faith. “The <i>faith</i> of your times will be the strength of salvations, <i>wisdom</i> and knowledge” (<i>Isaiah </i>33:6).
Only then will faith’s practical influence attain a [firm] basis. “The fear of Hashem—that is one’s treasury” (ibid.).

Paragraph 583

In order to vanquish destructive religious lawlessness and the rejection of belief, we must educate Torah sages who are healthy in their body as well as in all powers of their soul, educated with the best of reason and with the ability to recognize the pleasant feelings that result from engaging with the exalted [aspect] of the beauty of poetry and rhetoric, as well as the majesty of nature and the outstanding beauty in all skilled work. “A beautiful home, a beautiful wife, and beautiful vessels ease a person’s mind” (<i>Berachot </i>57b).

Paragraph 584

The good will that is established in the heart of the righteous person for the world, dwells very deep within his soul.
And from this shining point he is filled with greatness and might in the exaltedness of Hashem, and filled with dread and fear of every sin.
This will generates wonders in the world. It constantly impels all existence to emerge from its darkness to the light of the world.

Paragraph 585

The more one gazes upon their spiritual stature, so they will find that there is no cause for limiting their conceptions. On the contrary, let one’s power of conception conceive all that is within its ability, and even if it occasionally conceives of something great and mighty, it still will not have achieved more than a drop of the lofty greatness of which it is capable. How great the joy which comes from such a free gaze, when it is accompanied by the play of positive imagination. It has not yet achieved one portion in the limitless tens of thousands of the true Eden that dwells within all existence, all of which is a revelation of the transcendent playfulness, and Eden is the rock of all the ages to come
And no matter how much happiness he is filled with as a result of his free gaze when the laughter of the good imagination accompanies [his gaze], he will still not reach one part of infinite tens of thousands of the true Eden invested in all being, which is entirely a revelation of the supernal delight and the Eden of the Rock of all infinite worlds.

Paragraph 586

Sometimes there is a failing in [a person’s] refined faith because [that faith] does not know [how] to establish supernal thought on the foundations of all of the low levels in the human soul—those found in the nature of the flesh and in the inclination of the imagination, and even in a person’s attribute of delusion.
Everything must be sustained by thought that encompasses everything on its level, [but] the refined faith is concerned only for the intellect. As a result, all of the qualities of life outside the intellect remain uninfluenced by holiness.
Furthermore, since [only] the intellect is influenced by the supernal truth, which is the light of holiness, and the other qualities are not influenced by [that supernal truth], the result is inner destruction and war within the soul among the various inclinations, [because they] cannot blend together.
There is rectification for the well-being of the individual and of the masses only in a living faith that incorporates everything. [That faith] will be refined only in its trait of supernal intelligence. However, imagination and zeal, feeling and bodily sensation, yearning and the pining of the flesh, delusion and fervor [driven by] the imagination will not be lacking. Rather, everything will be guided under the control of supernal, purified knowledge, which possesses lucid intellectual light and [which possesses] that which is [even] more purified than [this light]—in keeping with [the verse,] “The secret of Hashem is to those who fear Him” (<i>Psalms </i>25:14).

Paragraph 587

It is proper that there be a soul for every spark [of existence] that aspires to rise, rising by means of the light of supernal kindness that appears constantly. And, how much more, [it is proper that there be a soul] for every creature that rises, in every hue of existence in which it exists: in the delineation of an action of the body or outside the body.
And [so too] everything that is classified, like species and their details—and, how much more, people and families, nations and languages: every inclusive concept has its soul, which rises.
And, how much more [than that], entire worlds that ascend, that rise, live as they utilize their body, until their soul is made complete, and after that, all of the spirituality within them rises. And they are bound with all their powers, overall and specific, in the overall knot of life that surpasses every imperative of body and localized world.
And when we see in a vision how many endless worlds have been before us, we know how much Eden and supernal light their spiritual overall lights receive in all their details. And the light of this Eden is in some form partnered with all of us together.

Paragraph 588

A person’s faith [regarding] Divinity elucidates how great and mighty his will and awareness will be when [that will] will become whole, in all its fullness.
It is understood that the way [of this faith] is clearly elucidated only when [a person has] complete knowledge of all existence, to the greatest extent possible.
And there remains forever the law that the knowledge of Hashem comes from the knowledge of the works of Hashem.
Faith encompasses all knowledge, making [a single] overall unit of all the details. With that, [faith] gives eternal life to all those who attain its light. And with the richness of its inner being, [faith] vitalizes ethics, societal life and the individual’s life, just as it vitalizes all worlds, from beginning to end.
All [worlds] together constitute a “metaphysical man,” a “supernal righteous being,” of whom [the verse] justifiably states, “By his faithfulness, the righteous man will live” (<i>Habakkuk </i>2:4).
The righteous individual derives the light of his justness from the influence of the dew of [that] “supernal righteous being,” from this “supernal man,” which includes all of existence, all of which together aspires and brings about a wondrous goodness that no idea can contain, from the castoffs of whose light all good exists, and the entirety of Eden and the garden.
And all souls and worlds are filled with a spirit of Edenic life, a spirit of might and holiness, which gives kingdom to kings, prophecy to prophets, poetry to poets, might to the mighty, and justice to the just.

Paragraph 589

How propitious are the commandments, which we appreciate in the light of faith. How much life they give us and the world. This will be recognized by a developed generation, which will rise beyond all the heights of scientific experimentations.
Within [our] soul, we see the worth [of the commandments]. “The secret of Hashem, which is with the upright and those who fear [Him]” (cf. <i>Proverbs </i>3:32 and <i>Psalms </i>25:4), will be revealed to the eyes of all by means of freedom of mind, which is coming to light.
Freedom alone is the father of supernal faith, “a true faith” (cf. <i>Isaiah </i>25:1), [which holds] the destiny of the future in its hand.

Paragraph 590

How foolish are the people who do not look at the wonders of nature and its laws, at the greatness of the deed of God in the world. Lacking the basis of a great and rich outlook on materiality, [their] spiritual outlook grows blurred.
All insolence and atheism come to the world to protest the insult to materiality from people who place an exaggerated [emphasis] on [abstract] form, who are unjust to the material [as] they negate and excoriate it, whether in its active aspect or in its theoretical aspect.
[But] all of those who engage with materiality uprightly and justly—whether those who allocate a reasonable portion to the body and to its demands, to society and to its demands and its earthly needs, or whether those who devote time to a knowledge-based outlook on all levels of materiality, in earth and in heaven and all that is in them—as their eye and heart [turn] to the spirit and the soul higher than all, they bring the blessing of satisfaction and peace to the world. They are the host whose heart God has touched, building ruins and restoring paths.

Paragraph 591

Every individual [who possesses] a holiness of self that has risen to the heights, where he sees the internality of existence, and who draws Divine inspiration from the depths of his soul: the more he looks at the exterior world with his wisdom and [from] his level, and [the more he looks] at all the claims, criticisms, and demands of exterior people, the sharper will his spiritual perception grow. [Then] from each husk, he will attain light, from each heresy, faith, and holiness from each impurity.
It is possible to reach these exalted [levels] by means of [receiving] constant guidance in the ways of Torah, in wisdom, in culture, and in a civilized way of life, being careful with them so that they do not contradict each other but only unite in a permanent oneness that rises the more that [a person’s] looking [at everything] with supernal wisdom, which leads to [his] recognition of the unity in the light of life and breadth of knowledge, constantly grows and shows its effect upon all of the pathways of life, traits, perspectives and deeds.

Paragraph 592

When awareness of the Divine exists in [a state of] lowliness in the human being—[whether in] the entire world [or in] the individual—then everything he does for the sake of Hashem receives a lowly form, and at times it deepens the impression of lowliness.
[However,] this lowliness is evaluated only in the context of the level of the human being, the generation, the society, and the environment.
If the Divine content is capable of rising, [but]—because of a lack of action and paucity of considering—it becomes stunted, then the [Divine] content is considered to descend from its level, and [when it] sends forth its influences, that is not for success.
But if [humanity’s] obligation is fulfilled, and [humanity’s] awareness performs its obligation properly—in the context of the generation and in the context of the place—then Hashem’s blessing fills the Divine content, and through [that content] everything is filled with richness, might, and the blessing of life.

Paragraph 593

Love for creatures requires a tremendous amount of cultivation that will expand it to the proper extent, [so as] to battle against a shallowness, which seems at first glance, due to one’s incomplete apprenticeship, [to exist] from the aspect of the Torah and from the aspect of customary morality, [to indicate] opposition or at least apathy to this love—[a love] that must [actually] constantly fill all the chambers of the soul.
The first rank in love for creatures must be held by the love for man, and it must even spread to all humanity, despite differences of perspectives in religions and faiths, and despite differentiations among races and climates.
It is proper to study the perspectives of the various nations and societies as much as possible to learn their character and content, in order to know how to base one’s love for humanity upon foundations that lead to action.
[That is] because [a person’s] love for the [Jewish] nation can be elevated in the brilliance of its nobility and its spiritual and practical greatness only by a spirit that is wealthy in [its] love for [all] creatures, [including] love for man.
An ill-disposed eye, which causes [a person] to see only ugliness and impurity in everything outside the boundary of the unique nation, even outside the boundary of Israel, is one of the most terrible [types of] darkness, causing universal destructiveness to the entire good spiritual construction, to whose light every refined soul aspires.

Paragraph 594

To correlate the [Torah’s] narrative of Creation with recent research is a worthy matter.
There is no proscription against interpreting the passage of “these are the generations of heaven and earth” (<i>Genesis </i>2:4) as enfolding phases of millions of years, until man attained some awareness that he is different from all animals, and via some vision it appeared to him that he must establish a family life that is permanent and that has a noble spirit by choosing a wife who will be connected to him more than his father and his mother, [who are] the natural masters of the family.
[Adam’s] slumber may be a depiction, which also enfolds [within itself] some era, until the maturing of the idea [expressed in the words], “bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh” (ibid. 2:23).
[This] verse teaches that family holiness preceded polite shame in time, as well as [surpassing it] in quality. Thus, after [Adam] awakened from [his] slumber, it was decided that “this time” (ibid.), even though “they were both naked, [they] were not ashamed” (ibid. 25).
And so we learn that a breach involving lewdness is not only a sin against propriety, which people engage in when no one sees [them]—[as in the verse,] “the eye of the adulterer awaits the evening” (<i>Job </i>24:15)—but that something embedded deep in the root of a human being’s soul [tells him] that “[a person] who sins against [God] robs his [own] soul” (<i>Proverbs </i>8:36).
And a person who separates himself from [such people] is called essentially holy.

Paragraph 595

It is very hard to gaze simultaneously at the spirituality of the world and its physicality. But mighty men of power strengthen themselves so that their sight will be complete in both aspects.
When the spiritual perspective rises, it elucidates the secrets of the world.
It shows through a holy lens—[characterized by] the polishing of the power of the imagination in keeping with the illumination of the intellect and the distillation of supernal manifestation—the honor of the Divine commandments, their pleasantness and their splendor. And it shows the greatness and the exaltedness that exist in Torah and in prayer.
In particular, it shows how the prayer of upright people rectifies the world, straightens the paths of life, and brings man out from dimness to light.
And the more the spiritual illumination of the world shines brightly in the soul of the thinker, [the more] do these truths grow clear to him and show him a full content of clear, refined and supernal life.
And when a person reaches that measure, entirely or in part, he is filled with humility, consoling pleasantness is aroused within him, and he rises in his teshuvah above all reckoning and appraisal.

Paragraph 596

Holiness spreads throughout the world. In a very secret way, it purifies its own deeds. It purifies and bolsters a person’s will, and it trains him to be an active vehicle to improve the world—[its] exterior and [its] interior. And [that holiness] raises the human will to the heights of [each person’s] practical and theoretical intellect.
If the Exodus from Egypt will be uprooted from its place, if at some point the past will no [longer] play a principal role in vitalizing the spirit, that will be when all of [the past’s] essence will be given over to the present [and] all of the sparks of souls will be set in the diadem of the future, as it becomes the present. Those [sparks] rose from the chasm of the past, from a time when [the past] was solely the principal conduit through which the life of the spirit in the world was drawn forth.

Paragraph 597

When scientific research finds precisely calibrated details in all of the modulations of chaos, when all movements that exist and that were brought into existence before the worlds reached their complete, [present] formation fit so well with the purpose of the complete structure [of existence] in its [present,] perfected [state, then] the [Kabbalistic] wisdom of “the Work of Creation” becomes more and more a revealed wisdom that is necessary for many people and that gives sustenance to many spirits.
And in accordance with the level of the preparation of the world for the mysteries of the wisdom of practical [Kabbalistic] creation, correspondingly, the ideas of the wisdom of spiritual [Kabbalistic] creation proceed, and they combine with life and reality.
And the Divine truths in the seal of supernal truth—[and supernal truth] always [serves as] the might of the true sages of the world, and absolute supernal truth is the light of Israel overall, who constantly desire that it will vanquish the world and affect all of the processes of life in [that supernal truth’s] might—[these Divine truths] proceed and become things that are equable for each person, until it becomes no longer possible to explain even simple faith to ordinary/ intermediary people without expanding the presentation of supernal secrets that stand at the height of the world.
And the gateways of the “Work of Creation” are themselves the essential causes of the opening of the gates of the [Kabbalistic] “Work of the Chariot,” which is the supernal flow of light that makes it possible for [a person’s] senses and resolves, [his] comprehensions and feelings, to adhere to the depth of robust spirituality, the source of a life that is whole and eternal, until [that] life proceeds in the power of its holiness to vanquish death entirely, and [then] goodness completely sweetens all evil.
Just as the intellectual, supernal, spiritual concept completes the individual’s will and refines the societal bond, so does it open the physical and spiritual senses to connect with reality as it is. And [reality’s] happiness and bliss, beauty and eternity, are revealed before [the concept].
Life in the body becomes expansive, pure, holy and refined, and life outside the body and above it shines constantly in all its brightness.
Spirituality rises continuously in man and in the world, at every moment of life.
[A person’s] supernal intelligence grasps in its awareness the latticework of [that] elevation, is refined by a vast radiance, and [then proceeds to] refine the entire world.
When [a person’s] spirituality reaches completion within its confines, and it [then] desires, out of its great bliss and satiety, to transfer its powers to a richer arena, the entire environment is adjusted [to align with] that, and an echo of the sound of the delight is heard from one end of the world to the other.
The world awaits the good light of this gaze [of such a person to shine] upon the dimness that the intermediate wisdom of life calls “death.”
[Such a person’s] decision to proceed in the light of the supernal truth brings [the world] to this robust state.
Societal life with all of the fullnesses of its rectifications; intellectual and emotional freedom with all their breadth; the power of the spirit and might of the flesh with all of their strength and loveliness: [in the future,] all of these together will be bound to the desires of the eternal [plane], because only [these three factors, having found] their solution, will stand by the world at the time that the [the world] is beleaguered.
Only supernal perspectives that come from the supernal source of supernal life will give back to the world and all that is in it—all of the oppressed, naked souls, and all those who dwell in the darkness in sick, ruined and polluted bodies—the power of the might of their lives, the flash of the beauty of their eternal being.
And the peace of the worlds and splendor of spirits for all flesh will again be revealed with brilliancy of might, transcending every restricted thought and idea.

Paragraph 598

All of the thoughts and ideas, great yearnings and mighty trials that every righteous person undergoes in his own spirit will affect the totality of the [Jewish] nation, [more] generally the totality of mankind, and [even] more generally the totality of the universe and of all universes.
A person’s soul very genuinely demands the supernal, inner and encompassing light. As he suffers thirst, he wanders a great deal, [seeking] to slake his spirit from the supernal [source of] quenching. [His] suffering truly depresses [his] spirit [so that he is] nauseated by life until [his] strength diminishes and [he] walks about like a lengthening shadow (<i>Psalms </i>109:23).
But if he nevertheless “does not turn to the haughty” (<i>Psalms </i>40:5) and he by no means wants to intoxicate himself with the external intoxication of the world—not with physical lusts, not with spiritual [lusts], not with fantasies, and not with what [people] call intellectual matters—but he stands on his guard, and his entire hope and desire is [to attain] the revelation of the supernal truth and the absolute good in his soul and in the world, [then] in accordance with the measure of the intensity of this quality, he equals the spirit of all worlds.
[Then] he surveys everything from his inner being, and light proceeds to come to him from out of his darkness, until [he] commands a faithful view from one end of the world to the other—each person on his level—gazing upon the pride of Hashem with great might and joy. And “the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn; it shines ever more brightly until the day is perfect” (<i>Psalms </i>4:18).

Paragraph 599

The truly righteous person, who truly desires goodness for the world and merit and goodness for people, has the power to draw to himself the entire character of the evil nature found in all of the spirits who cling to him with a sense of love and faith in the sages.
And since, as a result of his drawing [that] in, the evil is moved from them, they are purified and cleansed of sin.
As for himself, because of the magnitude of goodness in his soul, their evil is transformed in him to good, and gives him added beauty and immensely powerful light.

Paragraph 600

From the height of supernal existence, speech comes to a person’s mouth. One cannot imagine how great are the practical and spiritual deeds of might that speech brings about from the time it is disconnected from the source of its light to the time that it comes to be expressed.
And [then] speech [again] performs this powerful process with its self-expression as it returns to its source.
And when it is connected to Divine thought in Torah and in prayer, its light and the radiance of its wealth have absolutely no end. It literally creates worlds filled with power and life, courage and vast wealth.
And [then] the activity of the righteous person, the person with knowledge, who recognizes the value of speech, will be in accordance with the height of his awareness. “You will decree, and it will come about; and upon your paths, light will shine” (<i>Job </i>22:28).

Paragraph 601

That which simple appetite accomplishes for all creatures and for average human beings, stimulating the individual to eat in order to strengthen his life and his faculties, so too in a rarefied way, [with] elevated power, in people with great awareness, righteous people, the foundations of the world, [it awakens] the desire to unite with all of the holy sparks concealed in each food, corresponding to which the soulful joy awakens in the person who eats in their presence, receiving them into his soul, increasing, because of them, light and vast joy. And [the sparks] themselves add might and joy at that movement, even before the eating.
At the time of eating, joy blazes in the depths. And with the eating itself, it rises to a higher level. “Boaz ate and drank, and his heart was glad” (<i>Ruth </i>3:7): “his heart was glad in the words of Torah” (<i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, end of 604). Those are the eating and drinking themselves for those who enter the secret of Hashem, [for those] “who know [the meaning of what] they are shown in every gesture” (<i>Chagigah </i>5b).

Paragraph 602

A revealed and rational view of the world constantly must unite with a hidden, mystical view of the world. From the two of them together, in their entirety and in the wealth of their details, song will blossom, power will intensify, beauty will grow splendid, and “knowledge will increase” (<i>Daniel </i>12:4).

Paragraph 603

Every day in a person’s life is worth more spiritually than all of the days that preceded it put together. This even applies to the smallest moments and units of time, because the Divine kindness constantly increases light, and all of the impressions [left by] the past and given to the present, which adds its newness to them.

Paragraph 604

Every extravagant description that the heart cannot accept and believe pertains only to mundane affairs.
But regarding holy matters, every description of goodness and magnificence that blazes in the mind is only the very slightest trace of their praiseworthiness.

Paragraph 605

The more a person sanctifies his will and raises it to the heights of goodness, the more there shines within him the light of an awareness of the supernal Divine, whose supernal foundation is the awareness of God’s independent governance with absolute freedom, which is the content of absolute will, in which the descriptions of all [entities] are encompassed.

Paragraph 606

Supernal loveliness, Divine beauty, draws the soul to it. It awakens [the soul] from its slumber and arouses all of its powers to life.
It shines on [the soul] like the light of the sun on lovely plants. It fosters [the soul] with all of its branches [so that it is] filled with power, beauty, pleasantness and freshness.
The yearning for a relationship [to] the Temple, to the house of Hashem “at the head of the mountains” (<i>Isaiah </i>2:2), to “the cohanim in their service, the Levites in their song and Israel in their station” (siddur), and all of the connections of the spirit in the soul of the entire nation to its holy dwelling place arouses daily “the beauty of the world” [the Temple] (<i>Zevachim </i>54b) in the heart of Israel. [That yearning] places a supernal temple in the soul of every individual, beginning immediately at the beginning of the [day, with the recitation of the] “order of the day,” the order of the sacrifices and the incense offering.
All Jewish thought and feeling that is elevated in its height to the elevated apogee of the soul of the individual and the world is filled with life as a result of this manifestation of the heart that elite individuals are blessed with every day. In their concealed might, they affect everything completely: “the nation and the individual together” (cf. <i>Job </i>34:29).

Paragraph 607

The evil in the world finds its base in man, and it congeals within him. Every day it increases [its] vigor, undermining his ability to elevate himself [and] rise to goodness. “A person’s [evil] inclination rises against him every day” (<i>Kiddushin </i>30b).
A person cannot [prevail] without constant prayers, one of whose components is confessions.
A person must confess his sins, his transgressions—[whether] revealed, concealed, [or] doubly concealed—[and] his inclinations toward evil, which constantly caress him.
When the purification of prayer and confession occur every day of a person’s [life], when a personal accounting is not something he forgets, he shakes the evil off himself little by little, before it can become such a large heap that he cannot raise [his] head.
Those people who make [such] an accounting every day remove the daily evil. They confess before they go to sleep, on their own behalf and on behalf of the entire world.
At the [very] least, they express their protest at evil, individual and overall, wherever it may be. With that, they establish their spirit in the presence of goodness and holiness. With that, they raise their spirit to the root of the life of its holiness. They connect it so as to draw sustenance from the good wellspring. “In Your hand, I entrust my spirit” (<i>Psalms </i>31:9).

Paragraph 608

Spiritual creation is free. It doesn't concern itself with any opinion and any influence. It creates in accordance with the penchant of its inner spirit. The more its faith in itself grows, the more it rises to the heights of truth.
Falsehood, and the evil attached to it, come only from an external influence, which affects the spiritual creativity like a scab—which, with its power, commands [the spiritual creativity] to engage in profitless thought. “He has chosen to follow the command” (<i>Hosea</i> 5:11)—the command [(the sages say)] of idolatry.

Paragraph 609

All books, whether holy or mundane, and all viewpoints that come to a person from outside him, only help arouse his inner spirit, so that through them that which is hidden in his depths will come to light.

Paragraph 610

Via the Torah, a person absorbs the soul of Israel into himself. A person of Israel cannot live a complete life without the soul of Israel giving him life.
The totality of thought that comes to a person when his mind is lucid puts the human spirit in him and perfects him.
The more he accustoms himself with the rectification of the Torah and lucid thought, the more will his character be perfected as a result of his Israelite soul being bound with the human spirit within him. And each of them will pour its blessing onto the other.

Paragraph 611

A person must become rich in details first, so that he will be able to give his spirit the freedom and breadth to [view] overall vistas. That is the entire delight of the spirit of a person who yearns for the expansion of the river of supernal understanding.
After he attains a fair degree of acquiring details, [his] spirit [will] proceed to create general principles that rise above all of the details.
And when the character of [these] principles of supernal understanding are completed, they [will] hover over the many details like a dove hovering over her nest, bringing the life and light hidden in every detail from potential to actual by means of a penetrating comprehension that draws from supernal understanding and that bestows wealth to the many details in their multitudinous changing hues.
Then greatness [will] comes to a person, demanding that his actions not be [by rote], “a commandment of human beings that has been taught” (<i>Isaiah </i>29:13), but that each action and each habit, each service and each mitzvah, each feeling and each idea, each Torah [learning] and each prayer, will be illuminated in the concealed light, in the overall light concealed in the supernal soul prior to the manifestation of their actions.

Paragraph 612

Many of the minutia of the Torah appear superfluous, and they seem to people to be a burden, because they aren’t aware of the great power of evil in man and the world, and they don’t know how much counsel [and how many] safeguards and strategies people require to escape it—whether it is spiritual evil or practical evil.
It is true that because of weakness that has entered the world, commensurate with bodily and psychological impoverishments—which have in particular harmed the Congregation of Israel—strength in general has been impoverished, and with that as well the strength of evil, [so that] performing terrible sins is not possible. But the [evil] inclination exists in the heart: in the depths of potentiality, evil is hidden. And when strength will rise to its vigor, evil will awaken with it as well to ravage and corrupt.
Therefore, we always require "the light of Torah and the candle of the mitzvah” (cf. <i>Proverbs </i>6:23), which refine people, so that we may be well-shielded when the power of a full life returns to us, and [we may] receive goodness and light and cast the evil and darkness away. Every “word of God is refined; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him” (<i>Psalms </i>18:31).

Paragraph 613

Every mystical thought requires a multitude of exterior thoughts to actualize it and to be its shield and guardrail, so that its lights will not fall into the abyss of delusion, falsehood and destruction.
And every exterior thought requires a mystical spark to transmute it, to guard it from damage and from being transformed into a deadly drug in place of its original character as an elixir of life.

Paragraph 614

The rationalist view of the world, with all of its perceptions—material, practical, ethical, and absolutely spiritual; single and in combination, embracing and all-embracing—swallows up individual fine points and lines in [its] general illumination, and thus it easily rises to an overall expanse.
But a stumbling block is concealed [before] its feet, because it is not well-constituted to penetrate into individual exactitude.
This phenomenon may be seen from the power of rationalism in [terms of] the mundane as well as [in terms] of the holy.
Mysticism, [on the other hand,] does penetrate into particulars and the most minute particulars. It does not pass in silence over [any] line and point. There is no [single] “thorn” and “crown” [of the Torah’s letters] that it does not interpret in a multitude of wondrous [ways]. There is no slight movement nor smallest perception that will not spread rays of light that illustrate and describe, that lead to feeling and thought.
[But] mysticism is in danger of sinking into the minutiae of details, of having its broad wings caught in the clefts of the fearsome rocks (<i>Isaiah </i>31:9) of dark small-mindedness.
It must always therefore renew [its] strength. Sometimes it must absorb the superficial atmosphere of rationalism: it [then] raises it, as it holds it in its hand.
Most of all, it is always meant to rise to its supernal expanses with teachings of supernal greatness, [reaching] to the most expansive overviews, which themselves are considered as particulars when [even] broader overviews appear over them.
Ultimately, mysticism will vanquish with its Godly power, and it will bring its character to fulfillment as it shows the entire world that supernal greatness exists even in each iota.
“There is no haughtiness before God” (<i>Berachot </i>10b), nor lowliness. There is no smallness and no greatness because everything is high and elevated, and everything is lowly and meager. Everything is high and elevated from the aspect of the source of the life of light from the Life of worlds, which pours over everything. And everything is lowly and meager if one could imagine [everything] remaining alone without a source of light, with all of the <i>sefirot</i> [heavenly illuminations] growing dark.
“When You rise from [the <i>sefirot</i>], all of [their corresponding Divine] names remain like a body without a soul” (cf. <i>Patach Eliyahu</i>), “because with You is the source of life; in Your light, we will see light” (<i>Psalms </i>36:10).

Paragraph 615

When the power of [the nation of] Israel is great and its soul shines within it [until the soul] grows manifest, and [the nation’s] practical branches are rectified, completely organized—in holiness, unification and blessing (<i>Zohar</i> 2:116a), in the Temple and government, in prophecy and wisdom—then expansion to the side of the mundane, to delighting the spiritual and physical senses, to a penetrating and inward glance into the lives of the multitude of nations and various peoples, into their enterprises and their literature, [and] the strengthening of the might of natural life: all of these are good, and they help expand the light of goodness. And [that] area is extensive: [it corresponds to the] twelve <i>mil</i> [comprising] the entire camp of Israel [in the desert and the <i>techum Shabbat </i>(the distance designated by the Torah that one may walk outside a habitation on the Sabbath)], which truly parallels the character of the entire world: “He establishes the boundaries of the nations in keeping with the number of the children of Israel” (<i>Deuteronomy </i>32:8).
[But] when the light dimmed, when God’s Presence went into exile, when the feet of the nation were dislodged from the house of its life, constriction began to be required.
[With that,] all secular strength is liable to cause harm. All natural loveliness and the desire for it are liable to darken the holy light, [so that] purity and modesty are destroyed. Every thought that has not grown entirely in the camp of Israel can destroy the order of faith and Israelite life. Every slight prosperity leads to rebellion (<i>Deuteronomy </i>32:15). From here straitening and affliction, darkness and fearfulness have come. And more than they affect physical life, they affect spiritual life, breadth of thought, the flight of feeling—until the end will arrive, when a voice will proclaim powerfully: “Spread the place of your tent, and stretch the curtains of your dwelling places, do not spare; lengthen your cords and strengthen your stakes, because you will burst forth right and left, and your offspring will inherit nations, and they will settle desolate cities” (<i>Isaiah </i>54:2-3). And the narrow area of 2,000 cubits, [the <i>techum Shabbat </i>imposed by the Sages, will] expand, comparable to the measure of the salvation of Israel, [as its] light increases little by little (<i>Yerushalmi Berachot</i> 1:1).

It is totally impossible to come to the lofty spirit of [the daily recitation of] "Praise the Lord, call out in His name, make known His wonders among the nations," without an inner love from the depths of the heart and soul to do good to all of the nations, to improve their wealth and to enrich their lives. This characteristic is that which uniquely qualifies Israel to have the spirit of the Messiah dwell upon it.

Kovetz 2



Paragraph 1

Just as [we] must elevate [our] fallen thoughts and traits (in which evil and ugliness may be discerned) to the source of their root in holiness, where we see that they are really exalted thoughts and good traits, so too must [a person] lift up [his] thoughts that are decent but that stand at the lowest level  – where evil and chaos are united with them, even though they face holiness. [He must lift them up] to the most elevated level of the ideal sublime – [a state of being that] is directed only toward total goodness and absolute straightness – until the uplifting [of these decent thoughts] grows and [reaches] the supernal world, over which pure holiness rules in its might.

Paragraph 2

The insolence (chutzpah) at the time preceding the messiah comes about because the world has progressed to such an extent that it demands an understanding of how every detail is connected to the whole. A detail that is not connected to the great whole cannot satisfy [a person’s] mind. If the world were engaged in [gaining access to] the light of Torah to such a degree that [a person’s] spiritual soul [would] grow to recognize the proper connection between details and spiritual wholeness, then the teshuvah and rectification of the world would be actualized. However, because [people’s] carelessness has led to [a state in which] the light of the inner Torah – which requires [that a person attain] an exalted state and an inherent holiness – has not appeared in the world correctly, the demand [of people for the structure of a life in which the details are understood within the [framework of the] whole has come at a time when the complete revelation of the light and the clearing of the path [leading] to understanding has not yet arrived. And this has caused terrible destruction. We must employ the supernal remedy, which is [the attainment of] increased strength in [our] spiritual ability. Then the common people will, [with their] feeling, directly understand and access a way of comprehending and appraising that which connects all of [their] Torah-[related] knowledge and deeds to the most supernal wholeness. At that point, the strength of spiritual life will again appear in the world, in deed and in thought, and a universal teshuvah will begin to bear its fruit.

Paragraph 3

The essence of learning Torah for its own sake can come only after [a person] is capable of [gaining] an understanding – accompanied by feeling – of how all of the details of the Torah are beloved and holy, and of how the universal light, which is filled with life and brings life to the world, courses through all of [these] details.

Paragraph 4

There are various causes of depression. [A person] must overcome all of them with the joy of [performing] a mitzvah. That is a constant joy that suits [the people of] Israel because of the spiritual light that always rests upon them. One cause [of depression] is a tendency,[expressed in] action, for coarse pleasure. A person’s soul is drawn by that to a place of darkness, and [there] it grieves over its descent.[A person] should transform this great woe to joy, for when [his] soul [will] rise from the yoke of exile that had burdened it, a great stream of joy [will] rise up from below, and the sublime, pure [level of reality will] grow ever richer in its spirituality.

Paragraph 5

(One needs to distinguish and differentiate two levels of Divine Providence governing the world.) God’s guidance [of the universe, as] connected to the moral dimension – whether [in relationship to] individuals or to nations and [other] groups – is all an extension of the nature of universal morality poured into the essence of being. This [guidance is alluded to] by the name <i>Elokim</i> (“God”). However, higher than this stands [God’s] concealed free will, which does not correspond to a revealed moral state. Instead, [it corresponds] to the supernal ideal, which is in consonance with the supernal gaze, transcending the conditions of present day existence. The illuminations that come from this state are the lights of the inner soul of all being. They include the past, present and future, transcending the structure and form of temporal periods. All of this is encompassed in the name “<i>Hashem</i>” as it is structured and in all of the pathways of its permutations.

Paragraph 13

The rectification of the political state as a whole and the rectification of [each individual’s] body in particular are part of the highest manifestation of holiness – [a manifestation] so holy that it cannot be illuminated in a revealed fashion by means of a characteristic light that has an obviously holy form. Rather, the light is wrapped within [this manifestation of holiness] and [clings] to it like a garment. The noble strands that emerge from these [rectifications are] practical details directed toward the rectification of the state and [of each individual’s physical] health, in the form of Godly commandments. These may be compared to <i>tzitzit</i>. And the culture as a whole may be compared to the <i>tallit</i>. The <i>tzitzit</i> bring forth a holy revelation of all of the light hidden in the entire <i>tallit</i>, with [the light’s] great revelation and manifestation. [Similarly, the] deeds of Godly commandments and holiness that make [their particular] mark in the totality of human action, [deeds] directed toward rectifying [man’s] life – communal and individual –actualize the light hidden in the depths of all the structures of human culture. They bring the revelations [of that light] to the place fit for [the light] and make visible the light of eternal life that gives life to everything, including temporary life.

Paragraph 20



Paragraph 21

The <i>nefesh</i> of the sinners of Israel in the era preceding the coming of the Messiah – of those who connect with love to matters concerning the entirety of the Jewish people, the land of Israel and the renaissance of the nation – is more perfected than the <i>nefesh</i> of those fully faithful Jews who lack this quality of an intrinsic sensitivity to the good of the whole and the building of the nation and the land. But the <i>ruach</i> is much more perfected in those who fear God and who keep the Torah and the commandments, even though an intrinsic sensitivity and impulse to act in matters concerning the whole of Israel are not yet as strong in them as they are in those in whom a spirit of transgression fouls their heart to such a degree that they connect themselves to foreign perspectives and to deeds that pollute their physicality and prevent the light of the <i>ruach</i> from being rectified [in them]. As a result, the <i>nefesh</i> [of these sinners] too suffers from their blemishes. The rectification – which will come about via the light of the Messiah [and] which will be greatly aided by the spreading forth of the teaching of the secrets of the Torah and the revelation of the lights of the wisdom of God in all of its forms that are worthy of being revealed – is that Israel will come together in one bond. And [then] the <i>nefesh</i> of those who are [God-]fearing, who keep the Torah, will be rectified by means of the perfected <i>nefesh</i> of the sinners, who are good in regard to matters of the entire [community] and [in regard to] the hopes, material and spiritual, that can be understood by human awareness and sensitivity. And the <i>ruach</i> of the sinners will be rectified by means of the influence of those who fear God, who keep the Torah and who are great in faith. And thus a great light will come to both [groups]. The manifestation of complete <i>teshuvah</i> will come to the world, and then the people of Israel will be prepared for redemption. The supernal <i>tzadikim</i>, the masters of the <i>neshamah</i>, will be the unifying conduits through which the abundant flow of the light of the <i>nefesh</i> will pass from left to right and the abundant flow of the light of the <i>ruach</i> from right to left. And the joy will be very great. “Your priests will don righteousness and Your pious ones will sing joyfully” (Psalms 132:9). And this will be accomplished through the power of the light of the Messiah, who is David himself, who “lifted up the yoke of <i>teshuvah</i>” (Moed Katan 16b). “For the sake of David Your servant, do not reject the face of your anointed one” (Psalms 132:10).

Paragraph 22

The more a person loves people, the more that one gazes with an approving eye at those who are immersed with all their might in matters of this world and its construction, the more one’s mind becomes settled. If one is capable of turning to the heights, to a supernal spirituality, to Godly perceptions, one will [then] find oneself more at home in his supernal world. The necessary affairs of the world that are incumbent upon humankind [and] that by their nature interfere with the supernal vision will not disturb that person so much, because he or she will know that these are being attended to on his behalf by all of those people who find satisfaction in this practical work of theirs. Ben Zoma said of this: “Blessed is He Who created all of these to serve Me” (Berakhot 58a).

Paragraph 23



Paragraph 24



Paragraph 25



Paragraph 26

There is no room to ask about the source of a person’s knowledge of supernal information. When we find within the soul a supernal spirit and a treasury of well-arranged knowledge – so that everything is aligned with everything else – [we may know that] this is the pinnacle of clarified [knowledge]. All knowledge that derives from analysis is merely a means of attaining this supernal knowledge, which the soul pours forth from its deepest depths. The most effective means of attaining this supernal trait is clinging to God with all of one’s might and studying the secrets of the Torah.

Paragraph 27

The light of Israel shows how it is precisely the yearnings that transcend the entire world that give the world life and happiness. Eternity is necessary not only for the sake of eternity but also for the sake of the moment. And the moment is important because it is one of the revelations of eternity. The world is important because it is one form of the infinite numbers of forms through which the light of the Divine Being is revealed.

Paragraph 28



Paragraph 29



Paragraph 30

Sometimes, when there is a need to violate the words of the Torah, and there is no one in the generation capable of showing the way, it occurs through breaching. Nevertheless, it is better for the world if it occurs by way of accidental violation. This is the basis of the principle, "Better they do it by way of accidental violation than by willful violation" (Beitzah 30a). It is only when prophecy dwells upon Israel that it is possible to reform it according to a "horaat shaah" (see Mishneh Torah, Rebels 2:4), and then it would be done in a permitted matter and even a revealed mitzvah. But with the concealing of the light of prophecy, this reform is done by way of a breach, which depresses the heart because of itself, but gladdens the heart because of its goal.

Paragraph 31



Paragraph 32

Paragraph 41



Paragraph 42



Paragraph 43

A person’s instinct is swifter and more exact than his or her intellectual recognition. A human being’s greatness [lies in the fact] that one can raise all of one’s recognitions to the heights of the most supernal aspect within instinct – from which comes exactitude and swiftness. In regard to a supernal, exalted [state of being], those people who truly possess divine faith have the mightiest instinct. [In this regard,] all culturally-focused people will ultimately return to them. [But] in terms of intermediary goals – such as yearning for morality, knowledge, the building up and honor of the [Jewish] nation, and so forth – culturally focused people have the strongest instinct. Everyone who has a strong instinct [in some matter] is weak in those [other] matters that require [him to engage in] calculation and deliberation. Therefore the [various] strata of the [Jewish] nation must be bound together so that they will receive illumination of knowledge and strength of instinct from each other, in accordance with the level of the particulars of how these portions are divided among them.

Paragraph 63



Paragraph 64



Paragraph 65

Just as supernal holy people have no connection to mundane and trivial concerns, and [their] trait of holiness is beyond any [this-worldly] purpose, so that it goes without saying that [a holy person] eats in order to learn [Torah], pray, perform mitsvoth and the like-this being an intermediate trait –  [furthermore,] the essence of [the holy person’s] eating and similarly [that person’s] speech and all of the movements and emotions of life are filled with holiness and light. And how much more is it the case that for these people all wisdoms in the world – whether deep or superficial, pure or impure – have an intrinsic [upward] direction, and everything that enters into the circle of their awareness rises as they rise. It is true that, in practical terms, no one reaches this level, for the Torah has set eternal boundaries [barring certain behaviors] for everyone. But in regard to that which pertains to [the realm of] thought, “boundaries are no higher than ten [handbreadths]” (Shabbat 43a), “there is no Satan and no evil occurrence” (I Kings 5:18), and “even the Angel of Death teaches [such a person]” (Shabbat 89a).

Paragraph 66

In the days preceding the coming of the Messiah, whoever connects in the inclination of one’s heart to the salvation of Israel possesses the soul of a supernal holy person, which cannot be gauged with the measure [meant] for an intermediary [person].


Paragraph 67

Torah sages are perfected by means of the unlearned masses – for even though the light of the Torah constitutes the life of all [people], nevertheless it is also “a drug of death for those who turn leftward with it” (cf. Shabbat 88b), and it reduces the strength [of sages] much more than if they had been lacking Torah and [only] simple nature had acted upon them in the pathways of their lives. And since all people have a component of ugliness, however small, the Torah indeed becomes harmful to them corresponding to this component. And in this area – the harm is incomparably stronger than the reward. And the counter-remedy to the drug of death blended into the Torah sages is activated by the general connection that they have with the unlearned masses of the entire [Jewish] nation, for in this way the latter pour forth the influence of [their] natural straightness, which has not been at all degraded by means of any sophistry. [Then] the small drop of the drug of death turns back again into a drug of life. And in this way it also gives life to the entire people, including among them the unlearned masses.


Paragraph 68

[Regarding] the impurities in [people’s] understanding of divinity, awe, faith, and everything dependent upon these – as long as the nation as a whole has no need to rectify the ways of its practical life, the damage [that these impurities cause] is imperceptible. But since the time has come that the national revival must arrive, and the blossoming of the “horn of salvation” in actuality must be revealed, [these] impurities immediately create an obstacle. The nation can only bond together, and, in the depths of its life, understand the secret of its might and the images of its structures by means of purified perceptions and actions that emerge with the highest clarity from [people’s] pure, true knowledge of God. This is why a great negative force is aroused [at the time] preceding the coming of the Messiah, [a force characterized by] great insolence. That negativity will burn away all that is weak and ugly in Godly concepts and [all] that depends upon [those concepts], in the whole of the nation. Even though this is terrible to see – because a number of matters of truth, good traits, commandments, and laws seem to be swept away by the stream of negativity –  nevertheless, everything will ultimately blossom in purity and might with exalted holiness from the seed that is powerful, pure, and exalted, which no negativity will [be able to] reach. Its light will shine as a new light on Zion, with a wondrous greatness beyond any image that the impoverished powers of weary souls – [suffering from] material and spiritual weakness resulting from the long and debilitating exile – can visualize.

Paragraph 70



Paragraph 71



Paragraph 72



Paragraph 73



Paragraph 74



Paragraph 75

Our main knowledge of God is [through these three experiences of him]: as "One", as "Creator", and as "He who commands". All the wealth of further spirituality comes only to provide interpretations and definitions as to how to understand the [aforementioned three areas of ] knowledge: to clarify them, to raise them to a more ideal, noble, rational, and practical state; to be at once simple and exalted.

Paragraph 76

I love all. I cannot but love all people, all nations. From the very depths of [my] heart, I want the glory of all, the perfection of all. My love for Israel burns more greatly and is deeper, but [this] inner desire spreads out in the force of its love to all, literally. I have no need whatsoever to force this feeling of love – it wells directly from the holy depth of wisdom of the Godly soul.


Paragraph 77

No accident is it, but rather the very nature of my soul, that I feel pleasure and peace of mind when I involve myself in Divine mystical matters expansively and freely. It is my main purpose. All other purposes of my various other aptitudes, whether they be practical or intellectual, are but secondary to my essence. I have to find my happiness within me, not in the approval of other people, nor in any career whatsoever. The more I know myself, and the more I allow myself to be original and stand on my own two feet, from my self-awareness, merged with knowledge, consciousness, feeling and poetry, the more the light of God will shine on me, and the more my ability to be a blessing to me and the world will develop.

Paragraph 82



Paragraph 83



Paragraph 84

By its fundamental nature, [a person’s] consciousness of God flees a blemished, splintered and incomplete life for a life that is whole, outstanding, and full, even in this world. One spark of the light of God that lives in a person’s heart suffices to expel infinite instances of darkness. Those who say that the knowledge of God diminishes the character of life are fools without understanding who are standing on the outside. And a nation that knows its God must appear in the world with the knowledge of the on-going perfection of life in light of the living God.


Paragraph 85



Paragraph 86



Paragraph 87



Paragraph 88



Paragraph 89

A great soul finds it difficult at times to constrain itself to do any one particular form of [divine] service, or any kind of finite intellection or study, for it is constantly occupied with [supernal] images whose endless streams cease not, even for an instant.  These include various different matters, and exalted, yet hidden longings, about which even a person who thinks deeply will be unable to grasp them by nature of their depth and brilliance

Paragraph 90



Paragraph 91



Paragraph 92

Personal understanding of divinity can be encapsulated in <i>zeir anpin</i> (reduced size) [which concentrates one’s views of] God as unique, the Creator of all, [Who has made] the world and all beings with the work of His hands. But this understanding is small, and there exists <i>arikh anpin</i> (a broader state) [of comprehension that is] much greater than this, and that incorporates everything into a supernal and wondrous unity, exceedingly higher than the above mentioned personal thought. 

Paragraph 93



Paragraph 94



Paragraph 95



Paragraph 96



Paragraph 97

When a person sins, that person is in the world of separation. At that point, every element stands alone. Evil is evil in itself, with an evil and harmful quality. [But] when a person does teshuvah out of love, the light of the existence of the world of unification – where everything is organized into a single unit – immediately shines upon that person. And in [that] universal connectedness there is no evil at all, for the evil combines with the good in order to season it and elevate its precious worth even more. And with this, “willful sins are transformed into merits” (Yoma 86b) – literally.


Paragraph 98



Paragraph 99



Paragraph 100



Paragraph 101

If the new science [of our day] boasts of having freed itself from theology, it must be known that on the other hand, theology has now been freed from the sciences, which are bound in human cables. And as a matter of course, the term "new" must apply to supernal matters, not to things which humans create, but rather "the term 'new' is that which God Himself bestows (Isaiah 62:2)". The theology newly freed from being bound to the sciences is Prophecy, the unique [inheritance] of Israel, which shall soon be revealed to us. 

Paragraph 102



Paragraph 103



Paragraph 104



Paragraph 105



Paragraph 106



Paragraph 107

The insolence (chutzpah) at the time preceding the Messiah is [the expression of] a diminution of light, which has the purpose of rectifying the vessels. It is not at all similar to other, [previous] instances of criminality, which were entirely empty, [acting] in a destructive manner. However, within this camp of the insolent there are also sparks that must be entirely extinguished. And that extinguishing will come about as a result of a great illumination of the light of the Torah from supernal might, by means of the appearance of very great tzadikim. “The light of the righteous will rejoice, and the candle of the wicked will be extinguished” (Proverbs 13:9).


Paragraph 108

Without the insolence preceding the Messiah, it would be impossible to explain secrets of the Torah with an absolute revelation. Only due to the coarsening of feelings that results from this insolence (chutzpah) is it possible to receive very exalted intellectual lights. And in the end, everything will return to [a state of] complete rectification.

Paragraph 109



Paragraph 110



Paragraph 111

The feeling of love must develop in all of its details so that it will display all of its treasures of intellectual, emotional, and imaginative vitality. Then the treasury of God will rise to the heavenly love that is associated with the name of HashemGod. Similarly, the aesthetic sense must overall be so well developed that the soul can gird itself with the image of heavenly beauty, such that it will be able to stand at its highest levels. The literature of the [present] generation and the desire for the expansion of beauty that has taken hold of [the generation] – even though these tend toward mundane matters and are at times extremely polluted – are nothing else than preparatory levels for the supernal purity of the exalted glory that will appear in the world.

Paragraph 112

To provide a contrast to those studious people who are scrupulous about constant perseverance [in Torah learning], it is necessary that a faculty be found that shows how the free, inner light may be revealed through [a person’s] perambulations and tranquility, [which provide] a breadth of mind through which [one’s] soul rises, soaring in “a vehicle that flies through the air” (Sanhedrin 106b), where it looks for all of its desires, seeks its refined concepts – seeks and finds them. [Our] generation, which is so weakened by the torments of body and soul, requires the influence of serenity, for only that will bring about an inner perseverance, which will influence to a proper degree the outer perseverance as well, aligning it with the faculties of the body and spirit – and [it does so] in a way that develops all of the [generation’s] hidden ability, with a proper and assured development, until [that development] will emerge to provide a blessing for each individual and for the world.

Paragraph 119



Paragraph 120

When set against the supernal, divine truth, there is no difference whatsoever between imagined faith and heresy. Neither gives the truth. But from our perspective, faith comes closer to truth and heresy to falsehood. And therefore good and evil are derived from these opposites. “The righteous will walk in them and the sinful will stumble in them” (Hosea 14:10). And the entire world, with all of its physical and spiritual levels – everything relates to our level [of reality]. In regard to our level, truth is revealed in faith, and that is the source of good. And falsehood [comes] through heresy, and that is the source of evil. But in relation to the light of the Infinite One, everything is equal. Heresy, too, is a revelation of the power of life, for the light of life of the supernal radiance clothes itself in it. And therefore spiritual warriors gather very good sparks from it and transform bitterness to sweetness.


Paragraph 121



Paragraph 122



Paragraph 123

The main cause of spiritual exertion and the main obstruction to inner peace of mind comes as a result of a person remaining distant from what he is capable of from the qualities of his soul.

Paragraph 124



Paragraph 125



Paragraph 126

When [our] divine enlightenment is small, then the image with which we imagine Divinity is also small. And since the character of divinity makes clear to a person his infinite smallness, the extent to which he becomes a groveling good-for-nothing as a result of a fear of heaven that lacks intelligence cannot be imagined. How can a person attain an estimation of the divine greatness in such a way that the inherent form of the beauty of [his] spirit will not be blurred but broaden? [He does so] by means of his faculty of knowledge, by means of the liberation of his imagination and the soaring of his thought, by means of [his] knowledge of the world and life, by means of [his] wealth of feeling regarding all being. For this, a person must truly study all the sciences of the world, all ideologies of life, all the ways of the various cultures and the content of the morality and religion of every nation and language. [Then,] with a greatness of spirit, he will know how to purify them all. Obviously, the entire foundation of his knowledge as a Jew [must] be built upon the foundation of the Torah, in its most absolute breadth. And he [must] strive always so that his pathway will not be constricted and his perceptions will not be narrow and fragmented but proceed with breadth and in an assured manner. He [must] not bear many fears, which would prevent [his] intellect from doing its work and [his] spiritual faculties from pouring forth their influence. He must be courageous. He must know the might, the good and the evil, and the supernal origin from which everything flows in an orderly form – [a form] that gains perfection with his perfection. And then, in accordance with his soul’s greatness, the divine light will shine upon him, his spirit will be great, and the supernal divine humility – which expands all of [a person’s] talents – will fill all of his inner being, and a heavenly might will strengthen him always. And he will do wondrous things for himself and for the entire world.

Paragraph 127



Paragraph 128

It is proper to yearn to be bound to the entire nation of Israel. The more that a person purifies his thoughts and deeds, the more can he connect to the highest and smallest levels of the entirety. If there is smallness and preponderance of judgments [within him], the connection will be less inclusive. [And then,] if there is a lesser amount of connection with the most degraded level, there will be a lesser amount of connection with the greatest of levels. [This is] because complete perfection is connection with the complete entirety – whatever the manner and [to whatever] measure.


Paragraph 129

A great soul yearns to spread over everything, over all stages, to stretch its feet to the end of all rungs – in order to give life to everything, to draw everything close, to raise everything. To the extent that it stretches forth its feet, it lifts up its entire stature and grows. And with its elevation, it attains supernal levels. Great and mighty kindnesses appear before it. It straightens out all pathways. But smaller souls come and prevent it from stretching forth its feet. They press down its stature. It suffers, shrinks and comes apart. At times, it does the will of those who obstruct [it], shriveling within a narrow circle. [But] its eyes are lifted up to illuminate everything – including those who obstruct [it], including all strata above and below. It is filled with hope [that reaches] to the ends of the world, to an inheritance without boundaries, to the inheritance of Jacob, to the heights of the land (cf. Isaiah 58:13 and Yalkut Shimoni, Jeremiah 496).

Paragraph 130



Paragraph 131



Paragraph 132



Paragraph 133

Morality will not stand without its source. [That] necessary source is an infinite light that has been rectified [in accordance] with the manifestation of the universes. When morality without its divine source is consigned to people’s hearts, it is diminished and it wilts. Since morality comes to the world by means of divine conduits, it will always make [the world] fruitful. And since the means that connect human thought and [humanity’s] feelings with the unbounded and alltranscending divine light must exist in a variety of hues, the pathways of spiritual life are therefore different in every nation and established grouping. But the organizing, uniting matrix must necessarily vanquish and encompass everything. “God will be one and His Name will be one” (Zechariah 14:9).

Paragraph 134



Paragraph 135



Paragraph 136



Paragraph 137



Paragraph 138



Paragraph 139

There is a quality within the particular individuality of every person that is higher and more elevated than [the quality] of the communal nature that exists in the nation. That supernal individual aspect illuminates and gives life to the entire nation. In accordance with the elevated level of the individual, and in accordance with the number of individuals on a high level, the nation is elevated a very great deal in terms of its communal level. And that communal elevation is entirely in alignment with the most perfect individual greatness.


Paragraph 140



Paragraph 141

Our temporary existence is a single spark of eternal existence, of the splendor of the utterly eternal. The only way to actualize the treasury of goodness hidden in the content of [our] temporary life is by aligning [our temporary life] with eternal life. That [alignment] is an inner recognition that permeates the spirit all of existence. Not all the spiritual battles will succeed in moving [that recognition] from its place. [To the contrary, they] completely clear the roads before it. Even that which opposes [that recognition] is, in the depth of truth, supporting it. 

Paragraph 142

Eternity is the mighty basis of all cultural life in its fullest sense. The aspiration for the glory of eternity conquers death and wipes away the tear from every face (cf. Isaiah 25:8).

All descents of supernal tzadikim [righteous individuals] from their glory, from their station, from their health, and from their supernal spirituality occur only because [these tzadikim] have abandoned slightly the intensity of their supernal trait of kindness. As a result, they are affected by the pollution of the world, which is filled with harsh strictures and accusations. Instead, they must – since they are the “foundations of the world” (Proverbs 10:25) – always sweeten all of the bitterness and illuminate all of the dark places.

The essence of hearing the voice of God is that we take heed of the entire process of the ways of life in all of their details – [as applied] to general [national] groups in accordance with the differences between them, and [as applied] to each individual on his or her level – [as that process flows from] a universal, supernal wisdom that is alive and gives life to all being. The more clearly that the details flow from the spiritual, supernal, inclusive life – which is the wisdom of the soul of God in the world – the more a person clearly hears and listens to the voice of God speaking to him, teaching him and commanding him, literally. “I am Hashem your God, Who teaches you for your advantage, guiding you upon the path that you should go” (Isaiah 48:17).

Paragraph 179



Paragraph 180



Paragraph 181



Paragraph 182



Paragraph 183



Paragraph 184

When people think about divinity, at times [their] thought proceeds in a form that negates the world. That is to say, [they think] that the divine form in its greatness, in its might, in its holiness, in its beauty, in its vigor, in its infinite being, nullifies existence entirely, [so that] everything is considered as nothing, absolutely nothing. That is the thought which comes from might, and which is clothed in its trait [of might]. But there is another, more refined form [of a person’s thought]: that the divine thought perfects the world, giving all of existence its true worth. From this aspect of [a person’s] thought, whose source is kindness, [one’s] love of the world and of all creatures grows ever stronger, [to the degree that] all of the fullness of [one’s] divine love and lucid thinking on divinity grows full and takes up more space in the world. In this, the thinker is not separated from the world but raises the world to the supernal Eden, to the divine youthfulness and exaltedness.

Paragraph 185



Paragraph 186

At times, [a person] cannot engage in [learning] Torah, nor in any [good] deed or mitzvah, nor in any worldly activity, because [one’s] will to be connected to the supernal form of the pleasant, infinite light gains in intensity. [One] must then proceed step by step so as not to be separated from this holy yearning, which is the foundation of all and the most supernal enlightenment, which gives life to all human culture and to all of the hues of the various universes in all of existence. Instead, a person must rectify [this] great light by rectifying the vessels [that are to contain it] and drawing down [good, heavenly] desires (in the form of “lines” and “points”) that will be in alignment with [one’s] Torah thoughts, manner of [performing] mitzvahs, [and the way in which one proceeds upon the] pathways of life in this world in all areas of this-worldly behavior. With this, a person causes the world to be inhabited by a supernal holiness.

Paragraph 187



Paragraph 188

Trivial matters can be elevated only by means of the revelation of secrets of Torah. When the revelation of the light of supernal secrets comes in a strong flow, [then] all of the lowest elements are elevated, [so that] there appears within them the light hidden in the depths. And so in the days preceding the Messiah, “the wisdom of the scribes will rot” (Sotah 49b), and many trivial matters will proliferate, in the form of literature and social life. [Then,] as a result of the revelation of the light of the Messiah, all of them will be transformed to holiness. “Its fruit will be for food and its leaf for healing” (Ezekiel 47:12).

Paragraph 189



Paragraph 190

[When a person suffers from] a smallness of faith, it appears [to that person] that when people strive to strengthen their [this-worldly] situation, to fight against the problems that occur in the world, to acquire knowledge, might, beauty, organization – that all of this is external to the divine content in the world. Thus, a number of people who believe that they stand upon a divine basis are suspicious of all worldly progress. They hate culture, the sciences, political strategies – whether among Jews or non-Jews. But this is all a great error and a lack of faith. The pure outlook sees the divine appearance in every improvement of life: individual and general, spiritual and physical. It measures matters only according to the level of the usefulness that they have or the damage that they cause. Any movement that engaged in constructive creation, whether physical or spiritual, will never be an entirely negative movement. It may have imperfections, but everything in its totality is an element of the divine creation that is constantly acting. “Not chaos did He create it, but that it be inhabited did He make it” (Isaiah 45:18).

Paragraph 191

There are certain rectifications of the world that cannot be accomplished by tzadikim but only by wicked people and people with blemished views and deeds. It is true that with teshuvah out of love and a great effort to increase holiness in the world [making use of] the straight prayer of tzadikim, the tzadikim can also take part in these rectifications – which, in the general course of things, come forth only from the hands of wicked people and those far from holiness. These rectifications include societal improvements (such as tools of agriculture and war, some of which the world greatly needs, practical inventions) as well as others that are spiritual improvements involving various technical and intellectual sciences – into the details [of all of which] a soul crowned with piety and a spirit uplifted to holiness cannot penetrate. Only via the great ascent of the spiritual process can [we] attain this supernal blessing of having all the rectifications of the world brought about by tzadikim and holy people.

We have a tradition that a spiritual rebellion will take place in the land of Israel and among [the people of] Israel in the period of the beginning of the renaissance of the nation. The physical tranquility that will come to a part of the nation, who will imagine that they have already attained their entire goal, will diminish [their] soul. And days will come “of which you will say, ‘There is nothing desirable in them’” (Ecclesiastes 12:1). The yearning for elevated and holy ideals will entirely cease, and therefore the spirit [of the people] will descend and sink, but then a storm will come and bring about a revolution. Then it will be clearly apparent that the strength of Israel lies in eternal holiness, in the light of God, in the Torah, in the desire for spiritual illumination, which is the absolute might that conquers all of the worlds and all of their powers. The necessity for this rebellion is the tendency toward the aspect of materialism that must of necessity come into being in the nation as a whole in a powerful form, after periods of many years have passed in which the nation as a whole was completely devoid of the need and ability [to engage in] the material endeavor. And when this tendency is brought into existence, it will trample with wrath and create whirlwinds. These are the birth pangs of the Messiah, whose pains will refine the entire world.

Faith with which intellect does not agree arouses anger and cruelty because the highest aspect within a person, which is [one’s] intellect, is affronted by it. But as for supernal faith – although it is very much concealed, [consisting of] the wondrously hidden ways of God, these [ways] possess within themselves such great pleasantness that the anger that was stirred up as a result of [one’s] suppression of [one’s] intellect is immediately nullified. [That anger] is itself transformed into great sweetness and pure light because of the divine manifestation that unites with it and [then] descends to the lowly faith, which [in turn] bonds with [a person’s] healthy intellect in the revealed world. [Then] the hidden world and the revealed world come into alignment with each other, and together they build the house of Israel with a doubled beauty. “He will bring forth the main stone, as people cry out before it, ‘Beautiful, beautiful!’” (Zechariah 4:7).

When one truly looks at the good aspect of every individual, one falls in love with people, with an inner affection.

“I am in the midst of the exile” (Ezekiel 1:1). The inner, essential “I” – whether of the individual or of the community – appears within [an entity] only in relation to its holiness and purity [and] in relation to the degree of its supernal power suffused by the pure light of an elevated illumination, flaming  within it. “We and our forefathers sinned” (Psalms 106:6). Adam sinned. He was alienated from his essence. He turned to the consciousness of the serpent and lost himself. He did not know how to give a clear answer to the question, “Where are you?” (Genesis 3:9), because he did not know himself, because he had lost [his] true “I,” with [his] sin of bowing to a strange god. [The nation of] Israel sinned. It “ran after foreign gods” (Deuteronomy 31:16). It abandoned its essential “I.” “Israel rejected goodness” (Hosea 8:3). The earth sinned [during the week of Creation]. It denied its essence. It constricted its power. It went after [limited] goals and purposes. It did not give forth all of its hidden power so that the taste of the tree would be equal to the taste of its fruit (Sukkah 35a). It raised its eyes to look outside of itself, to think about [its trivial] future, its “career.” The moon complained [at that time] (Hullin 60b). [As a result,] it lost its internal orbit, the joy of its portion. It was dreaming of a superficial beauty of royalty. Thus does the world continue to sink, with the loss of the “I” of every [entity] – of the individual and of the whole. Learned educators come and focus on the superficial. They too remove their consciousness from the “I.” They add straw to the fire, give vinegar to the thirsty, and fatten minds and hearts with everything that is external to them. And the “I” grows progressively forgotten. And when there is no “I,” there is no “He,” and how much more is there no “You.” The Messiah is called “the breath of our nostrils, the anointed one of God” (Lamentations 4:20). This is his might, the beauty of his greatness: [that] he is not outside of us. He is the breath of our nostrils. Let us seek Hashem our God and David our king. Let us tremble before God and His goodness. Let us seek our “I.” Let us seek ourselves – and find. Remove all foreign gods, remove every stranger and illegitimate one. Then “you will know that I am Hashem your God, Who takes you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am Hashem your God” (cf. Numbers 15:41).

Rather, [the thanksgiving sacrifice will draw] from the essence of all of the sacrifices that will cease to rise straight upward with tremendous strength.

My soul soars above all these, above all that bears a name, above delight, above every delight and beauty, above all that is exalted and ethereal.  I am lovesick.

Paragraph 280

I thirst, I thirst for G-d, as a deer for watered brooks.  Alas who can describe my pain?  Who will be a violin to express the songs of my grief.  Who will voice my bitterness, the pain of seeking utterance.  I thirst for Truth, not a conception of Truth, for I ride on its heights. I am wholly absorbed by Truth. I am wholly pained by the anguish of expression.  How can I utter the great Truth that fills my whole heart?  Who will reveal to the multitudes, to the worlds, to the creations, that fill everything, to nations and man at once, to the sparkles filled with treasures of light and warmth, which are stored inside my soul....

 I am bound to the world all creatures, all people are my friends.  Many parts of my soul are entwined with them. But how can I share with them my light? Whatever I say only covers my vision, dulls my light. Great is my pain, and great my anguish. Oh, my G-d, be a help in my trouble; find for me the graces of expression.  Grant my language and gift of utterance.  I shall declare before the multitudes, my fragments of your Truth, oh my G-d.

Paragraph 339

Every time the heart beats with a true spiritual pulse, every time a new, noble idea is born, we are listening. It is like the voice of the angel of G–d knocking, tapping at the dors of our soul, asking us to open up in order that it can appear to us in the fullness of its glory. And the more free our spirit and pure our soul when we meet it, with emotion admirable and mighty, with the most serious and deep desire for the highest, most elevated and honorable love, so multitudes of noble souls manifest, illuminating our darkness with their glow. Our give and take with the objective, spiritual world is progressively sanctified, and our connections to it strengthened. Habit works upon us, settling our minds through calm and clarity of consciousness, and the capacity for manifestation, that fragment from the majestic grandeur of prophecy, begins to move us – bringing us healing upon its wings. We will be secure from all delusion, from any evil or lie with which the imagination could insult us, if we hold fast to the tree of life of the Torah of our fathers, to its pleasant guidance, to its order and commands over all the paths of life, in our relationship to humanity, to family and nation, to life and all its matters. And with this we have no need at all to be bound by communal ties which choke the transcendent free spirit; they desecrate the holy, that which comes from the highest world, from the world of freedom where free rein is given to thought, absolute liberty to aspiration complete freedom to the inclinations of the will, to creation. And as freedom expands, holiness increases and life becomes more elevated. “And will I rejoice in the LORD, exult in the God who delivers me.” (Habakuk 3:18) Let everyone bring into being that which their soul shows them, in truth and simplicity, bringing to fruition their spiritual potential without deception. And from sparks such as these great torches of light will be formed, lighting up the whole world with their glory. It from pieces of inner truth such as these, that the great truth will appear.

And the spiritual savage thinks, that all that is read and written will feed his soul, until he come to distinguish between holy and profane, between the things that give eternal life, and the things that disrupt the course of the true life.

Before my eyes shines the holy torch of the refined and admirable light of the world. The light of Israel - its delights fill the entire universe with holy elevation. From its rivers streams down the powerful quality of life in the power of its pure originality. The lives of high souls are nursed from its springs, from the Splendor of the worlds, from the majesty of Eternity. The lights appear with the pure recognition of divinity, by the refreshment of the desire to be situated in the center of existence in the power of its elevation. The Jewish soul is pressed by the blossoming forth of love that fills the light of its life, which takes up all of its focus. Great raging waves from one end of all the worlds to their other end rage deep within its soul. Purity overpowers purity, eternity overtakes eternity - and the secrets of the Life of the world pushes the cycles of history, so that Jewish history is revealed in the splendor of its colors. It moves and soars in its awesome power towards its supernal action, its holy flight - the holy of holies. But below it small clouds flow, dark lights mixed with shade that draw forth from its nectar, brightened by traces of its light, but darkening and mixing with them, weighing down the souls that become attached to them. For such is how they are in their foundation and thus do they love. And with the descent, many causes of darkness, wild and stormy winds and a misleading bridle upon the jaws of peoples. Yet amidst all the darkness flicker sparks of its splendor.

The thought of the reality of the world strengthens practical precision and adopts the foundation of valor. And conversely, the ideal and visionary depiction of reality weakens the character of valor and places practical content within the idealistic vision. Heresy stumbled on the stumbling block of the gross material reality of the world in the crude form of separation from the unity of divine rule, and it raised itself from practical and real content, wishing to rise to idealistic sublimity, and it stumbled in that the separated materiality overpowered in form and enslaved the idealistic content to it. Thus it defiled the storehouse of every precious vessel, beginning with connection and ending with separation. The Hasidic tendency diminished the reality of the world, and through this practical enthusiasm was weakened and was sublime in idealistic inwardness. Indeed, later on it descended from its completeness to defend the limited practical existence in its world, and it was not similar to heresy, which abhorred the practical from separation that has no healing. The way of Torah is not occupied with taking away the reality of the world, but rather with unity. Divine rule and valor is evident in prominence and clarity, and practical content is extremely precise. And if worlds come in which all is sublime, then all the content of heroism as it is evident in the advantageous sublime tangible creation will shine in the light of great kindness, in which idealistic brilliance resides. And to this storehouse of life all eyes are turned, and it comes specifically according to the multitude of action, and Torah was given to Israel because they are brazen, from His right a law of fire for them, the laws of these are fire.

Great destruction comes to the structures of the soul when the inner light of 'the time for silence' appears, when the fullness of the beautiful glory and heavy burden of the highest holy muteness fills the soul, if one rebels against it and breaks out in speech. This rebellion against the sovereignty of silence destroys all its buildings, all the storehouse of simplicity and rectitude, of depth and transcendent communication - everything shatters in fragments. Afterwards, if one wants to rebuild that which was destroyed, they must establish everything anew, and in that moment a discerning person is silent. In truth when silence is honored in the moment of its appearance, then it asserts its rule, establishes its hall, penetrating to the deepest depths of its abyss and bringing out glorious ramifications and mighty branchings with a powerful and refreshing vital force - the shrubs (sichim) are filled with strength and new expressions of the lips (Is. 57:19) come. Then the time for speech begins, in its beautiful glory, and the spirit of silence serves as the mediating angel that works upon the flood of speech, flowing like a river in all its preciousness and abundant wealth. "I will create new expressions of the lips: Peace, peace, both far and near, says the Lord. And I will heal him. (Is. 57:19) "...Their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing."

From the beginning of the early ones of the earth, from the mountain tops (alluding to Numbers 23:9), from the fathers of the world flows a heritage of free service to God — to reveal the heart in holiness, to seal a holy seal upon the thoughts of the heart, in every matter, in every way of life, in every type of time and throughout all changing events. The optional epiphany, the voluntary service rises up in a free flow; it raises up the strength of the soul and all of its powers. It stands at the peak of its height in its free world so long as it does not come to development and structure, to the fortification of a people, and to the ordering of the planning of an organized nation — it acts and is acted upon in a set historical plan. [Yet,] with all of its constriction, the organized global plan is a higher stage of development in its inner form than the poetic radiance of the optional event, even with all of the breadth of its expansion. There is, however, a time when the higher form will be caught in the trap of its limitations to the point of depressing the spirit. It is then that the light of the forefathers will light up. "Remember the covenant of the forefathers for the children," and the optional flame of the voluntary service will break through the limitations, refresh the spirit, lighten up its endeavors, succor the dryness of the exactitudes, and invigorate the fire of life within them. There are some for which the flame will come like a stream of breaches, and the outer and inner breaches will meet one another. And there are others for whom the rocks upon which life depends will blur from the horror of the feelings that the spirit will bring up in the breaking of its frameworks. But after its seal is opened, its light will appear from outside, and it will take form in vessels that are from different vessels (alluding to Esther 1:7). The ruins will be rebuilt, and a new building full of the old in the apex of its glory will arise. A king may breach a fence to forge a path (alluding to Sanhedrin 2:4, with the king in this context being God). Fence my breach [<i>peretz</i>] with the son of Peretz [the messiah] and strengthen the lily that has been plucked (alluding to Song of Songs 6:2). Sometimes the trait of breaching will grow to the point of going outside, to the point of falling to devastation. But even the pit and the devastation is before God, and He is the one who brings down to the pit and makes to rise up (alluding to I Samuel 2:6) — that is the congregation of Korach who will rise in the future. And all who fell from a surplus of passion will rise up in the future, and those are the majority of the defiant ones [<i>ma'apilim</i>], who died in their sin. And at the end of the day, it was stated about all of them: <i>Gather My pious ones together to Me; those that have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice</i> (Psalms 50:5). And in the order of life, that jump which came for destruction in ancient times will come for its purpose in later times in a more limited and more refined form. And even if the contents are not yet sweetened in the second version, it still has a threesome within it. And the word is commanded for a thousand generations (alluding to Psalms 105:8), and the planting shall return to its root and be replanted. And they shall be rebuilt with My people, and they shall be satiated with the life of God in righteousness and in justice. <i>And the distant ones shall come and take part in the building of the Temple of the Lord </i> (Zechariah 6:15). <i>And I will also take from them for priests, for Levites," said the Lord</i> (Isaiah 66:21).

The [Jewish] heart longs for the comprehension of the Land of Israel, for the faith of the Land of Israel, for the holiness of the Land of Israel. O, How to latch onto the joy of the Land of Israel, the inner tranquility of the Land of Israel, the devotion of the Land of Israel, the truth of the Land of Israel, the vigor and courage of the Land of Israel, the certainty of the Land of Israel? Pity, O God, have mercy, O compassionate and gracious God, have pity, grant me the ability to return to You in complete repentance, and bring me back to the Land of Your delight. Let me merit to see the joy of Your nation, to praise You with Your heritage. Have mercy, have mercy, O loving father, have pity now, save us now, O God that saves.


Paragraph 72

My broken-heart and sorrow and my tendency toward depression come from my inability to be satisfied with anything in this world except the illumination of God's light, the manifestation of His pleasant holiness. In times of hiding and concealment - what pain I feel, what bitterness I feel. From the depths I call out to you, O God, "I called aloud to Him, He is exalted on my tongue," (Psalms, 66:17) "In distress, you called out and I rescued you, I shall answer you from the secret place of thunder." (Psalms, 81:8)

Once can know their spiritual standing by the clarity of their speech. The more that their soul's light lives within them, to the extent that they feel each word they speak forth shooting out like an arrow, like a flood of living waters, and how it is drawn from the source of life, making its impact in the world. The particular quality of speech's affect is measured according to the extent of the soul's elevation, each according to their level. 

Paragraph 79

When one speaks of sacred matters, but feels discomfort because of the holy manifestation pouring out within, know that the impure soul is gradually shrinking away. It is this soul which is pained by its reduction, and of its own accord goodness progressively overcomes. Through this very knowledge, through faithfulness to it and delving deeply in it, the pure soul awakens in joy and knows that it she becoming holy, rising up, spreading out more and more. “The LORD is their strength; He is a stronghold for the deliverance of His anointed,” (Psalms 28:8) “…and my heart exulted, so I will glorify Him with my song.” (Ps. 28:7)

The fallen souls with whom I associate give me strength.

The essence of their depression stems from a thirst for the light of God and His goodness, and they rejoice for there is someone who can speak to their inherent goodness. For I know how very deep the light of God burns in these fallen [souls]; a spirit from on high blows within them: how deeply in their souls do they want to walk in the pathways of light, in the ways of goodness and dignity. I am certain that in the end, God's aid will come to them, and the light of God and His goodness will manifest upon them and they will return out of great Teshuva; from an abundance of love will they come close, and the light of dignity and righteousness which is alight in their depths will become a huge burning light. "The nation which walks in darkness will see a great light, those who dwell in the land of the shadow of death, a light will shine upon them" (Isaiah 9:1)

At times, your soul is revealed to you in all its naked ugliness, and you are repulsed by the vision. But only in this way can you calm your spirit: for corresponding to the ugliness of the soul and its impurity, so will its beauty and purity grow. “One corresponding to the other did God create them.”
After you strengthen yourself and rise beyond the shocking vision of that aspect of ugliness—so that the aspect of purity shines before your eyes, the aspect of the beauty within your soul, and your eyes, seeing, are illumined—then you will gain consolation for every monstrous vision that had terrified you. “The humble will increase their joy in God, and the most impoverished will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel” (Isaiah 29:19).

When we forget our own subjective soul, when we distract ourselves from looking at our inner life, everything becomes confused and uncertain. And the main teshuvah, that lights up the darkness in an instant, is that one returns to oneself, to the roots of one’s soul, and immediately returns to God, to the soul of all souls, and stride forward up and up in holiness and purity. And this is the case with a lone individual, a whole people, all of humanity, with the restoration of all being, whose ruin always proceeds from forgetting itself. And if it desires to return to God, but isn’t prepared to gather its scattered ones, this is a deceptive teshuvah, taking God’s name in vain. And so only by the great truth of teshuvah to oneself, will a person and the nation, the world and all the worlds, all of being, return to its maker, to light in the light of life. And that is the secret of the light of the Messiah, the coming into view of the soul of the world, with whose illumination the world will return to the root of being, and God’s light will reveal itself upon him. And from the source of this great teshuvah, man will draw the sacred life-force of true teshuvah.

The hatred of wickedness, when it is great and deep, must at firstcome together with hatred of the wicked. Only afterwards can it be sweetened through the power of consciousness and clarified until it takes its clean, ennobled form which is solely the hatred of wickedness, while toward those who carry it, who are the wicked themselves, we are filled with compassion. ‘Let the sins cease and not the sinners.’ (Berachot 10a) If at its inception hatred comes in its ideal form, focusing its essence only on the hatred of abstract wickedness, it will never be actualized in its full strength even as that hatred of wickedness. This is because the lack of hatred for the wicked will blur the hatred of wickedness itself, and then all the storehouse of good will be placed in great danger. This was the stumbling block for many fallen, who fell because from the beginning they employed the hatred of wickedness in its ennobled form, and the absence of hatred for the wicked afterwards was transformed into love for them. And through the love of the wicked they fell into the love of wickedness itself. Therefore, the first thought must be in the quality of the aspect of judgment, and afterwards mercy will come and sweeten it through their union.

Paragraph 233

Man’s will is bound up with the Divine Will, and flows from the radiance of its light. Only so long as one does not reveal this connection in himself, the Divine treasure within his will is not revealed. But in so far as man sets his heart to know that we have no will other than a revelation from the light of the Divine will - according to the extent this is revealed, the precious ability of his will to affect, bring to be, innovate and decree is revealed. And according to that measure comes prayer and shows its wonders, and even common expression comes and works wonders as well, sometimes without intention like the blessings and curses of a Sage which are given on condition, even though the condition is not fulfilled, or the unintentional act of a leader, for better or worse; and even in the revelation of some simple motion like the slipping off of one shoe causing rain to come. (Berachot 20a) “Before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.” (Isaiah 65:24) 
We must explain the foundation of prayer. The prayer in its standard form, request, is a technical ideal, in the highest sacred sense. The individual will is not an isolated thing, it is an offshoot of the all-encompassing will, of the outpouring of will which rises above at the head of all. It pours out from the will of the One who generates all things, the Creator of all the worlds, the One who renews creation each day, always. The branched off will is weak, its ability is naught, because in its self-conception it is separate from the all-encompassing desire; to the extent the individual will cleaves strongly to the sacred all-encompassing will, it rises up and its ability intensifies. In the moment of prayer, when one turns to G–d from the depths of their will, the essential power of their particular will rises. And according to the measure of this qualitative cleaving, this individual will, freed from its particularity, goes running in leaps and bounds, flying and overflowing in its return to the foundation of its life, to the source from which its existence was carved, to the depths of G–d’s will, the Master of all, and does His work, according to its (His?) will and conception.
