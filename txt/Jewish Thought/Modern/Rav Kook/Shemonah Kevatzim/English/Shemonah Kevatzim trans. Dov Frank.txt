Paragraph 75

Our main knowledge of God is [through these three experiences of him]: as "One", as "Creator", and as "He who commands". All the wealth of further spirituality comes only to provide interpretations and definitions as to how to understand the [aforementioned three areas of ] knowledge: to clarify them, to raise them to a more ideal, noble, rational, and practical state; to be at once simple and exalted.

Paragraph 76



Paragraph 77

No accident is it, but rather the very nature of my soul, that I feel pleasure and peace of mind when I involve myself in Divine mystical matters expansively and freely. It is my main purpose. All other purposes of my various other aptitudes, whether they be practical or intellectual, are but secondary to my essence. I have to find my happiness within me, not in the approval of other people, nor in any career whatsoever. The more I know myself, and the more I allow myself to be original and stand on my own two feet, from my self-awareness, merged with knowledge, consciousness, feeling and poetry, the more the light of God will shine on me, and the more my ability to be a blessing to me and the world will develop.

Paragraph 89

A great soul finds it difficult at times to constrain itself to do any one particular form of [divine] service, or any kind of finite intellection or study, for it is constantly occupied with [supernal] images whose endless streams cease not, even for an instant.  These include various different matters, and exalted, yet hidden longings, about which even a person who thinks deeply will be unable to grasp them by nature of their depth and brilliance

Paragraph 101

If the new science [of our day] boasts of having freed itself from theology, it must be known that on the other hand, theology has now been freed from the sciences, which are bound in human cables. And as a matter of course, the term "new" must apply to supernal matters, not to things which humans create, but rather "the term 'new' is that which God Himself bestows (Isaiah 62:2)". The theology newly freed from being bound to the sciences is Prophecy, the unique [inheritance] of Israel, which shall soon be revealed to us.

Let each person express in truth and sincerity what their soul reveals to them. Let each bring forth their spiritual creativity from potentiality to actuality, without fakery. And out of such sparks, torches of light will gather and illuminate the entire world with their glory. Out of such fragments of inner truth will the great truth emerge.

The fallen souls with whom I associate give me strength. I sympathize with them, I desire their rectification, their wellbeing, their light, their salvation, and they feel revivified and peace of mind. The essence of their depression stems from a thirst for the light of God and His goodness, and they rejoice for there is someone who can speak to their inherent goodness. For I know how very deep the light of God burns in these fallen [souls]; a spirit from on high blows within them: how deeply in their souls do they want to walk in the pathways of light, in the ways of goodness and dignity. I am certain that in the end, God's aid will come to them, and the light of God and His goodness will manifest upon them and they will return out of great Teshuva; from an abundance of love will they come close, and the light of dignity and righteousness which is alight in their depths will become a huge burning light. "The nation which walks in darkness will see a great light, those who dwell in the land of the shadow of death, a light will shine upon them" (Isaiah 9:1)
