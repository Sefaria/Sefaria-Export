<b>A person may not allow one’s fear of heaven to override his natural morality</b><br>It is wrong to allow one's fear of God to displace natural feelings of justice and morality.
When this happens, it indicates that one's fear of God is incorrect and impure.
Fear of God that we receive from the outside, through study of Torah, must advance our innate moral feeling. This illustrates a general principle of Rav Kook's teaching, according to which everything that we learn from the external surrounding world must develop, and not replace, our innate nature and the divine spark that has always been concealed within us.
The progress of the individual or society, even if it is material, is of great religious value.
That is, if fear of God obstructed the developments that were useful to society or the individual
This excerpt is the basis for the concept of conflict between halakha and ethics. Here Rav Kook says that fear of heaven that leads to such a situation is wrong; it contains some mistake that must be corrected. The ideal that we must pursue is an agreement between obedience to God and intuitive ethics. (For a more detailed discussion of this see P. Polonsky, <i>Religious Zionism of Rav Kook</i>, Chapter 7; E. Zusman, <i>Halakha</i>, <i>Poetry and Natural Morality in the Teachings of Rav Kook,</i> and paragraph 126 of <i>Arfilei Tohar</i>, below.)

Comment 1

<b>Just as [we] must elevate [our] fallen thoughts and traits</b><br>Thus, even those thoughts and qualities that appear "bad" or "negative" spring initially from the holy and good and must be elevated to their source. In other words, we must develop the good essence that already exists within those negative thoughts and traits. It will then become evident that the evil is merely superficial, while holiness and goodness are present and merely being misused or sublimated. Therefore, these thoughts and qualities are not intrinsically "bad"; rather, they are simply misguided. The idea of channeling the soul's evil aspirations into a positive direction (instead of suppressing them) is a classical tenet of Judaism.
Even that which is kosher, or permitted, is not necessarily at the level of the ideal, and therefore must also be corrected and uplifted.
These thoughts and qualities, although they are as a whole directed toward the good, nonetheless contain a certain element of chaos and evil, though this element is weaker than in those that are "fallen and misguided."
This first paragraph, which serves as a foreword to the book, states that the "kosher" level of thought, understanding, and action (which may have been sufficient for previous generations) is inadequate in today's world, and that the kosher must be improved until it is directed toward the absolute good - that is, the good of the universe. The book <i>Arfilei Tohar</i> devotes itself for the most part to the question of how to move from the "kosher" to the "ideal."

Comment 2

<b>The insolence at the time preceding the Messiah comes about</b><br>The phrase "insolence at the time preceding the Messiah" refers to the words of the Talmud (<i>Sotah</i> 49b), which states: "In the footsteps of the Messiah insolence will increase". The Hebrew term <i>chutzpah</i> can be translated in various situations as "impertinence" or "insolence". However, in this case it has a more positive connotation; here, the term implies audacity, or the ability to persevere in the face of adversity and to achieve one's goal with absolute resolution.<br><br>The term <i>chutzpah</i> was used by Zionists to emphasize the free, bold, pioneering character of the first Zionist settlers in the State of Israel, as well as their psychological superiority over Jews of the Diaspora. Rav Kook, who identified the Zionism of his times as the beginning of the Era of the Messiah (the Talmud's description of the increase in <i>chutzpah</i> clearly correlated with the psychological self-determination of the first Zionists), uses the word to describe the audacious departure from religion on the part of the founders of Zionism. See also sections 68 and 107.
Rav Kook speaks here as much of the contemporary cultural thought (which is manifested in science, ideology, philosophy, sociology, and so forth) as of the projection of this state of things onto religion. The world has now developed and matured to the point where people need a complete picture (such as the modern scientific paradigm or the model offered by physics, in which all parts of the whole are determined by general laws, and it is those laws that humankind strives to discover); the contemporary mind will not tolerate a model in which unrelated parts exist in themselves, disconnected from general principles or philosophies.<br><br>In principle, this contemporary state of affairs is a positive thing ("the world has progressed"), for it advances humankind. But it has negative side effects as well. Many individuals in contemporary secular society regard religion in such a way that they generally support its essential values and ideals, but reject those "details" that they see as disconnected from the central goals of the religion. For instance, some people recognize the important idea behind the Sabbath as a weekly day of rest - and even extol the ancient Jewish religion and proclaim the ideal of a weekly day of rest; at the same time, they reject the concrete laws against Sabbath work, as they do not see how these "details" are related to the principle of "rest." Or, for example, while extolling the moral justice proclaimed by the ancient prophets of Israel, some individuals reject the prophets' exhortation to observe concrete commandments, as they see these as unrelated to the general principles and ideals of moral and social justice.<br><br>Secular Zionists at the time of Rav Kook saw many of the commandments of Judaism as discrete parts, disconnected from general ideals, and they therefore rejected them. 
<i>Teshuvah</i> means repentance, return, the rectification of sins and flaws, the lifting of the world to God.
In other words, the rejection of religion in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries reflected not a decline in the spiritual level of the Jewish people (as many in the religious establishment claimed), but, on the contrary, a higher demand for spiritual systems, for a clear understanding of the connections between the concrete aspects of religion and general spiritual principles. At the same time, in the world of Torah studies, no similar intellectual movement took place. Thus, the public consciousness asked for a more advanced and deeper understanding - and the world of the Torah had no adequate response. This is what led to the "terrible destruction" of the traditional framework of Jewish observance.
That is, a "lower remedy" - a simple call to observe the commandments, to return to the earlier Judaism that those people had rejected - would not help.
Developing people's spiritual intuition and raising the level of Torah study.
That is, until all of this is understood by and evident to the average person.
"Universal <i>teshuvah</i>": This refers to Rav Kook's concept of the universal elevation of the world to God, described in detail in <i>Orot haTeshuva</i>.

Comment 3

<b>The essence of learning Torah for its own sake</b><br>We normally understand the phrase "to study Torah for its own sake" (and the Jewish tradition emphasizes the importance of precisely such study) as study without practical purpose, study for the sake of studying. Rav Kook casts the phrase in a new light, meaning "to study Torah for the sake of Torah," that is, for its ability to renew and deepen the individual who studies it. This involves the study of the interconnections between all of the details and specifics of the commandments and the general ideological and philosophical principles. Such study, as demonstrated in the preceding paragraph, is necessary in order to help our generation reach a state of <i>teshuvah</i>.<br><br><b>An additional note on the connections between Paragraphs 1, 2, and 3</b><br><br>Just as the "kosher" alone is insufficient and must be raised to a higher level of idealism and sanctity, so, too, the "usual" study of Torah as no more than a collection of laws is inadequate (especially as this was the type of study that led to its rejection by an enlightened generation). Study of Torah must include the revelation of the meaning of its laws and their connection with general values. This is the message of paragraph 3.

Comment 4

<b>There are various causes of depression</b><br>When we look at the world around us, we see much that grieves us. In many situations, our grief must be overcome by "the joy of performing a mitzvah"; mitzvah - that is, not only by means of gladness and joy, but through the understanding that the grief itself is the point of departure for progress, for the realization of God's commandments by Israel. For this is the very thing Israel is called to do: to bring the divine light into the world through the realization of the commandments.
That is, the soul ceases to see and distinguish the divine light; the person is mired in the material realm.
The lifting of the soul to higher worlds is the realization of the commandment to return (<i>teshuvah</i>). In Rav Kook's teachings, as explained in <i>Orot haTeshuvah</i>, <i>teshuvah</i> is not only a matter of rectification of misdeeds, but also elevation of the world to a higher spiritual level. Since in the process of its creation the world has been moving away from God, it must return to God; thus, global <i>teshuvah</i> is the original commandment - to lift the entire world nearer to God. Return of the individual's soul from the "exile" of materialism is also a form of <i>teshuvah</i>.
In other words, pure spirituality, by itself, unconnected to material realization, is not "full-blooded": it is pure - but pale and impotent. Although it is distressing when the soul descends into lower, material worlds, it gains fullness and completion there, it becomes emotionally and existentially richer, and, on its return to the sublime level, it is enriched. This is what comprises joy. Today's descent of the soul is the basis for its future ascent, which will bring it to a more sophisticated level. We should find joy in the awareness of the future ascent of our soul, and of the whole world with it.<br><br><b>Additional note on the connection between this paragraph and the preceding one</b><br><br>When the older approaches to Torah study (which failed to provide a sense of connection between the parts and the whole) cease to be effective, the soul, both individual and national, plunges into the darkness of materialism; in this lower region it is at least able to observe the link between specifics and general values. The individual and social bodies both wish for material pleasures, and they immerse themselves in these; the soul contemplates this and is distressed. This distress must be overcome not by rejecting materialism, but through an understanding that this descent is historically necessary (and although one need not contribute to it, one must recognize that the world is so ordered), and through the joy of realizing that in the future, with the help of a more full-blooded life, we will rise to a yet higher level. (It is important to note that we are speaking here not of a descent into sin by the breaking of commandments, but of the descent into materialism by grasping for worldly pleasures.) All of this applies, of course, both to the individual and the nation.

Comment 5

<b>Two levels of Divine Providence</b><br>The first level of providence is associated with moral law, that is, good is rewarded and evil is punished. Moral laws also include, of course, repentance, forgiveness, mercy, grace, and so forth - that is, everything that comprises divine morality as we understand it.
Thus, the universe itself is essentially moral, created by God in such a way that moral law governs it. (This is discussed in more detail in <i>Poetry of Being</i> by Yosef ben Shlomo, Chapter 6, "The Moral Tendency of Being.")
<i>Elohim</i>, usually translated as "God" in the Torah, is associated with divine justice.
This will is determined not according to the balance of past and present moral criteria (merits, sins, mercy, gratitude), but according to the purpose of the universe, that ideal that we must attain in the world.
If the first kind of divine guidance - the providence founded on moral law - proceeds according to the state of the world and of people in the present moment; the second kind - the providence of the higher ideal - is founded on the goal that the world will attain in the future.
That is, the providence founded on the attainment of the ideal takes into account not only the past and present (the cause) but also the future (goal). In order for the world's future to be what God wishes it to be, certain processes take place in the present. The first type of providence is causative; the second is teleological.
The tetragrammaton, the name of God in four letters (<i>haShem</i>; usually written as YHWH in the Torah) is associated with the manifestation of the divine as the God of the Covenant, who transcends the law with His mercy, and whose relationship to humankind is at the highest level.<br><br><b>Connection with the preceding paragraph</b><br><br>It was noted earlier that what today is a cause for distress may in the future become the source of progress and joy. We must overcome distress caused by current circumstances by regarding those circumstances not in isolation, but as a link in the chain of past, present, and future. Then we will see that events and situations have not only a cause but also a purpose.

<b>The rectification of the political state as a whole</b><br><i>Tikkun</i> is a Kabbalistic term that means the rectification of the world - bringing it into conformity with the purpose of creation.
The government is the national body, and in this sense, the act of rectifying it is parallel to the individual's rectification of his physical nature.
The rectification of the material body (and, in particular, of the government as the material body of the people) holds such a high potential for holiness that this holiness must be concealed, as such a revelation would cause the world to drown in it, destroying the existing order of the universe.
See Psalms 104:2.
This refers to those situations in which the structures of government (or the material body of the individual) are affected in the fulfillment of clear, concrete commandments. 
<i>Tzitzit</i>: the commandment to put fringes on the corners of garments (Numbers, 15:37 - 41)
<i>Tallit</i>: The four-cornered prayer shawl to which <i>tzitzit</i> are attached
The <i>tallit</i> is "simply a garment"; but people need garments for warmth, for proper appearance, and to construct civilization, through which humankind's divine potential is revealed. The holiness of the <i>tallit</i> is not obvious, whereas that of the <i>tzitzit</i> attached to it is open and visible. But it is only the existence of the <i>tallit</i> that makes possible the fulfillment of the commandment to wear the <i>tzitzit</i>. Yet the <i>tallit</i> is also a reservoir of immense hidden holiness, only some of which is revealed through the <i>tzitzit</i>.<br><br>Note that the word <i>tzitzit</i> is derived etymologically from a root meaning to "show on the outside." Thus the concealed holiness of the <i>tallit</i> shows through the <i>tzitzit</i>.
In other words, God's purpose for Creation is the realization of holiness in the material world; therefore, everything material - every person and entity - contains great potential holiness. We see a small obvious manifestation of this holiness (the <i>tzitzit</i> in relation to the <i>tallit</i>) when the material - including the body, society, the state, civilization - gives us the opportunity to carry out specific commandments. Ultimately, however, it is not these commandments in and of themselves, but of the gradual revelation of that hidden potential holiness contained in the body itself (society, state, civilization). Then, even matters of ordinary, transient life will "make visible the light of eternal life." Therefore, the rectification (<i>tikkun</i>) of the material (including the body, state, and civilization) encompasses immense although not obvious, holiness.

<b>The nefesh of the sinners of Israel in the era preceding the coming of the Messiah</b><br>In Kabbalistic literature, <i>nefesh</i> means the lower, external part of a human's divine soul.
Those who break the law of Torah
This refers to secular Zionists of the early twentieth century. See also the note to paragraph 2.
These true believers are strongly focused on the book and tradition, and their independent sense is underdeveloped.
In Kabbalistic literature<i>, ruach</i> means the higher, more internal part of a human's divine soul.
Because secular Jews have a healthier <i>nefesh</i>, the external part of the soul, they better perceive the divinity in the external world, in the life around them and the normal course of history. (This is why they became Zionists, having heard the voice of God resounding in history and calling them to Zion).
The soul (<i>nefesh</i>) of the first group (secular Zionists) is of a better nature than the second group, but is subjected to the powerful negative influence of a spirit of transgression, and so gradually continues to get worse.
The light of the Messiah refers to the light that emanates from the divine purpose (the coming of the Messiah), rather than from an evaluation of the ephemeral state of things. In this light, every segment of the Jewish people is regarded not according to its present level, but to the contribution it will one day bring to the future ideal. (See also paragraph 5 above.)
This refers not to "technical" or superficial study of Kabbalah (which has become popular in recent times), but to the deeper understanding the Kabbalah offers into the processes currently taking place among the Jewish people as a whole and in the State of Israel. Such an application of the Kabbalah for an understanding of historical processes in the life of the Jewish people is the Torah of the Messiah's deliverance. (Note that even in the sixteenth century, R. Itshak Luria, the Arizal, believed that the process of messianic deliverance would require a renewal of Torah, which would be linked to broader study of Kabbalah as a vital component of Judaism.)
Within this unified Jewry, each group will offer the good that it brings, and accept from another group that which it lacks.
That is, the secular Zionists, who are "sinners" in that they transgress many specific laws of Judaism (Sabbath, kashruth, and so forth), are nonetheless "good" in regard to the rebirth of the Jewish nation. Therefore, Rav Kook refers to them as "perfected sinners."
All progress that can be attained by humankind in the material and spiritual realms, in scientific knowledge, in the social sphere, in emotion, and in art (regardless of religion) is the realization of spirituality.
Each of which made possible the rectification of the other
In other words, repentance and rectification will take on not only an individual but also a national and universal character.
This term can be understood literally as "those possessed of the higher divine spirit." The word <i>neshamah</i>, used here, refers to the Kabbalistic idea of the third level of human's divine soul, deeper and more sublime than either <i>nefesh</i> or <i>ruach</i>. Thus, this refers to those who understand the essence of both groups discussed above, fully realizing the ideals of both - and therefore becoming the authority for each with the ability to influence its adherents.
The "perfected sinners," possessed of a rectified soul (<i>nefesh,</i>) are the left side of the Jewish people, whereas the God-fearing Jews are the right side; and with the aid of the "supernal <i>tzadikim</i>," masters of the third level (<i>neshamah</i>), the light of rectification of the <i>nefesh</i> comes to the God-fearing non-Zionists, and the light of rectification of the <i>ruach</i> to the secular Zionists.
See Psalms 132:9.
The Messiah will send the light "from the future" and thus help us to rectify ourselves. Only when we look not to the past, but to the future, only when we cease to evaluate the virtues and sins of different groups, but see their future unity, can we aid in the transfer of positive influence from one group of Jews to another.
The tribe of Judah - and King David in particular - is known for its special powers of <i>teshuvah</i>. Striking examples of this in the Jewish tradition are the stories of Judah and Tamar (Genesis 38) and David and Bathsheba (1 Samuel 11; see commentary there and in <i>Moed Katan</i> 16b). Therefore, the "Messiah, son of David" has unique powers of <i>teshuvah</i>, and in the light of his coming, various groups of Jews will be able to rectify themselves and one another.
See Psalms 132:10. We see here an additional dimension that Rav Kook brings to our understanding of "the Messiah, son of David." This Messiah is the son of David not only in the sense that he is David's descendant, but in that he takes up the burden of <i>teshuvah</i>: he is able to bring all of the Jewish people to repentance and perfection, both secular and religious.

Comment 22

<b>The more a person loves people</b><br>Furthermore, the individual will not be at all angry with others for immersing themselves in worldly matters - and for dragging him or her there as well.
God is, above all, the Creator (Genesis 1:1), and therefore the image of the divine in humanity demands that one live a creative life, make constructive efforts, and attempt to discover the unknown within one's self and within the world. Those who live only an imitative, routine life sin against the image of the divine within themselves.
In order for spirituality to grow in the future
In sum, the spiritual person attains calm through the understanding that all of these material affairs are necessary and serve as a basis for the progress of the spirit. As a result, such a person will not be angry or irritated by the pressures of practical, ordinary matters.

Comment 26

<b>There is no room to ask about the source of a person’s knowledge of supernal information</b><br>In matters of supernal knowledge (as distinct from lower knowledge, such as practical halakha,) there is no need to reference classical texts or to seek the origins and bases of such knowledge.
Intuitive knowledge is on a higher plane, inasmuch as it springs from the depths of the soul, and any analytical knowledge of the world is no more than a method, or preparatory stage of approaching intuitive knowledge. (For more detail, see <i>Poetry of Being</i> by Yosef ben Shlomo, Chapter 3, "The Rational and the Irrational.") At the same time, this in no way means that analytical knowledge is unnecessary. Rather, it is necessary - but only as a preparatory stage.
Study of the deeper meanings of the Torah (together with its usual, more superficial meanings) develops one's intuition and allows people to see things they have not noticed before in the world around them.

Comment 27

<b>It is the yearnings that transcend the entire world that give the world life and happiness</b><br>The "light of Israel" is the example shown by Israel, that is, the teachings of Israel, as seen through the national-historical experience of the Jewish people.
People often think that for life to be richer and fuller, one must occupy oneself with the affairs of this world, leaving aside "unnecessary" higher aspirations. The reverse is the case, however; the example shown by Israel demonstrates that when a person strives for higher goals, those goals enliven the world, making it richer, fuller, and more complete.
One must not think that eternity is the opposite (much less the enemy) of the present moment. On the contrary, when a person is connected with eternity, he or she progresses more effectively in the realm of the transient.
The moment is important not in itself, but because without it, eternity would be incomplete. The transient is an integral part of the eternal. On one hand, we must strive for eternity to make the moment more complete; on the other hand, the moment is not something separate and unnecessary, in opposition to the eternal, but is, at the same time, a part of it.
In summary, various religious conceptions, addressing the question of the relationship between "this world" of transient life and "that world" of true and eternal life, generally follow one of two approaches. The first approach sees this world in a positive light, but merely as a preparation for the future world, with no inherent value of its own (this is the usual understanding of the words of the Mishna: "This world is like the antechamber of <i>Olam haBa</i>"). The other approach views this world as an obstacle that must be rejected in order to reach eternity. (This spiritualist approach is usually rejected by Judaism, but variations of it can be found in some European sources.) Rav Kook believes that contempt for the material world, which is an element of both approaches, though more sharply expressed in the second, is fundamentally incorrect, and that reality "avenges itself." Strong souls, sensing the spiritual importance of the material (although such people would never use such words themselves), frequently reject religion, since, in moving to the purely spiritual and severing itself from its foundation in reality, religion loses its vitality and cannot answer the spiritual needs of such people. Accordingly, Rav Kook offers a third approach. He sees "this world" as an integral part of eternity, and thus eternity is filled with the light of transient life, which now takes on a full, spiritual and religious meaning. See also paragraphs 141 and 142 below.

Comment 30

<b>At times, when there is a need to disregard words of Torah</b><br>The word "when" does not appear in Rav Kook's manuscript; it was added by the editor in the 1983 edition. The revision somewhat smoothes over the radicalism of Rav Kook's statement - that there is an inevitable need to disregard words of the Torah.
That is, who can do this in the permitted way, by "temporal decree" (<i>Hora'at Sha'ah</i>), a directive to temporarily suspend a commandment.
That is, a spontaneous movement of the people, which "breaks the fence," a mass disruption of religious law.
If there has been no <i>Hora'at Sha'ah,</i> and the rectification of the situation has come about by means of a disruption, then it is better that this should be in the form of a spontaneous action by ordinary people (in error) than that religious people should intentionally break the law.
According to the Torah, a prophet has the right (in a critical historical situation) to suspend certain Torah laws. A classic example of this is the prophet Elijah, who created a religious revolution when he carried out the sacrifice on Mount Carmel rather than in the Temple (I Kings 18:23), as the times demanded this. (It must be noted that the laws of the Torah apply to a stable situation, in which life flows normally. But no stable system can be equated to a critical situation, and it is such cases that the Torah anticipates with the concept of <i>Hora'at Sha'ah.</i>)
Inasmuch as in this case, the commandment to obey the prophet - including temporary injunctions - will be carried out.
Breaking the fence - and also breaking the law itself.
The words "long-lasting" were deleted by the editor of the 1983 edition, who saw them as too harsh and drastic. 
Because there is a departure from observation of Torah and the commandments.
That is, this change, in the end, is important, and is fundamentally for the better. The "outer" is what exists today; the "inner" considers the future in terms of that deep change in the existing situation that is necessary to build the future in the right way. To prevent an incorrect understanding of the text, the concluding words were revised by the editor of the 1983 edition to read as follows: "although these processes dismay the heart as they are, they cause it [the heart] to rejoice due to the future (i.e., the aim) to which they are directed."

Comment 33

<b>Holy people must truly be natural people</b><br>That is, the idea that a holy person must be not of this world is incorrect. Rather, the righteous should not be severed from nature and life; they should not be locked inside the house of learning.
If holy people are so immersed in Torah and the observance of the law that they separate themselves from the surrounding reality, they will not be able to lift the world - that is, to carry out the divine mission.

<b>A person’s instinct is swifter and more exact than his or her intellectual recognition</b><br>Rav Kook identifies three levels of knowledge: instinctive, intellectual, and intuitive. Paradoxically, the lowest level, the instinctive, is in some way akin to the highest, the intuitive. (This is discussed in more detail in <i>Poetry of Being</i> by Yosef ben Shlomo, Chapter 3, "The Rational and the Irrational.")
One would be mistaken to assume that instinct is the simple, primitive part of a person and that in the process of further development and progress it will wither away. On the contrary - in order to become true harbingers of the culture of the future, we must not stray from our instinct and intuition, but develop and attend to them. This applies not only to the higher realms (the striving for the divine), but also to the "middle" realms (the striving for knowledge, morality, and the improvement of the material side of life on both the individual and national level). The most outstanding people in each of these areas are those with strong instinct and intuition.

Comment 67

<b>Torah sages are perfected by means of the unlearned masses</b><br>See <i>Shabbat</i> 88b. To "turn the Torah leftward" signifies a preponderance of judgments; see paragraph 128.
The Torah causes harm to the sage according to the share of ugliness that inevitably exists within the sage's soul (small as it may be).
The Torah, like an "expanding glass," inflates all parts of the sage's soul, the good and the bad; thus, the sage's inner ugliness, small by nature, also expands, and the harm becomes very great in proportion to the Torah that sage has studied.
The relationship between the sages (<i>talmidei hakhamim</i>) and unlearned masses (<i>am haArets</i>) is not depicted here in the usual one-sided way (sages are called to teach and direct the simple masses) but as two-directional. As the sages teach the masses and move them forward, so the masses also rectify the sages. This is in keeping with Rav Kook's overall view, in which each segment of the Jewish people makes a beneficial contribution to the general advancement of all of the other segments, and in which each group has its shortcomings that must be rectified (in particular, by the influence of the other groups; see paragraph 21). It must be noted, however, that Rav Kook lacks the reverence for the common people, which was widespread in some ideological teachings of the time. Beyond doubt, simple people, like all other segments of Jewry, have their merits and their positive influence on others, just as they have their own abundant flaws, which they must rectify under the teaching of others. Accordingly, the rectification of the sage furthers the spiritual advancement of the common people.

Comment 68

<b>Impurities in understanding of divinity</b><br>That is, minor errors, irregularities, or snags. As a whole, the Jewish religious interpretations in exile are correct, but there are some impurities, that is, incorrect treatments of certain aspects of Judaism.
These relatively minor errors and distortions did not particularly cause much harm during the centuries of exile.
That is, achieve national unity on all levels, including the physical (governmental)
And the Judaism that has been brought from exile does not have that highest clarity, as it contains impurities. It therefore cannot serve as the foundation on which to build the State.
This is a paraphrase of the Talmud (<i>Sotah</i> 49b): "In the footsteps of the Messiah insolence will increase." See note to paragraph 2. 
Insofar as the renewal of national life requires a relatively clear understanding of the divine, and all impurities impede the advancement of national resurrection, insolence will burn away all that is weak and ugly in the religious sphere. Before the national resurrection, these imperfections did not cause much harm. But now that the resurrection has begun to develop in practice, they have become obstacles, and a "demolition force" will sweep them with insolence from its path.
This is a quotation from the morning prayers. Here, Rav Kook gives it the additional sense that only a new light can shine on the renewed Zion; the old light - the Judaism of exile - is not strong enough.

<b>I love all</b><br>The ideal of Judaism is not love for the Jewish people only, but for all of humankind, even for all of creation.
Our love for the world and humanity should not be identical for all things, but should be "graduated." Our love for those close to us should be greater than our love for those who are distant, and our love for the Jews should be greater than our love for other peoples.
It is right to love all creation, but one should love one's own people more strongly. Nonetheless, one should in no way limit oneself to love for the Jewish people, since without love for all, even one's love for the Jewish people will not take the correct form. Love for all creation springs directly from the soul, and without it the soul cannot be fully realized.<br><br><b>Additional note</b><br><br>This excerpt is simple and far from radical; however, it helps us to keep this point in mind.

<b>Consciousness of God flees a blemished, splintered, and incomplete life for a life that is whole, outstanding, and full</b><br>One's "consciousness of God" is not a superficial knowledge of religious law and texts, but rather, a deep sense of one's personal and national life as an unending dialogue with God.
The purpose of religion is not only to call for the salvation of the soul but to bring the divine light into our world.
The thirst for a full and vibrant life is a reflection of the fullness and brilliance of the divine.
When one person begins to feel and manifest this in life, it is passed on to the many others surrounding that person. 
They believe that the more energy, light, and color are found in this world, the less can be found in the divine world. But this is incorrect; although it is sometimes thus when the Jewish people are in exile, it is fundamentally untrue in the State of Israel.
They are "standing on the outside," that is, they see everything superficially. They do not look deeply into things. They are outside of true Judaism, so they are spiritually "outside" of the Land of Israel. (They know only the Judaism of exile. Among these people are both those who are for and those who are against this exile form of Judaism, but they all share an incorrect understanding of Judaism, so that the arguments of its defenders are incorrect, and the arguments of its attackers are irrelevant.)
The Jewish people in its proper state of development.
The most important epithet for God in the Tanakh is the "Living God"; He is joined to all aspects of life, not set apart.

<b>Understanding of divinity at the level of zeir anpin and arikh anpin</b><br>The Aramaic term, <i>arikh anpin,</i> is the <i>partsuf</i> of the <i>sefirah Keter; zeir anpin</i> is the <i>partsuf</i> of the <i>sefirah Tiferet.</i> In Kabbalah, the <i>partsuf</i>, or face, is a complex of <i>sefirot</i> that appears as the personal manifestation of the divine. The phrase <i>arikh anpin</i> (in Hebrew, <i>erekh apayim</i>) translates literally as "long face" or idiomatically "slow to anger" and <i>zeir anpin</i> as "short," or "small face" (in conversational Hebrew z<i>eir anpin</i> has come to mean "in miniature"). This term also connotes "short tempered" or "impatient." The <i>partsuf zeir anpin</i> signifies divine governance of the world based on the fluid balance of good and evil, on reward and punishment that are imperative at the local level at the present time. This type of dialogue between God and man is extremely important; on the individual intensity it can rise no higher than this.
Accordingly, at the individual level of dialogue with God, a person understands that God is the creator. God made the world, He rules it, and He acts in mercy and justice.
This understanding is not wrong. On the contrary, it is necessary and, at its level, correct. However, our task is to rise to a higher level.
The plane of <i>arikh anpin</i> is our recognition at the level of the "Providence of Unity." Everything in it shares a common goal and purpose. (The two levels of divine intervention - Providence of Good and Evil and Providence of Unity - are discussed above in paragraph 5. The <i>arikh anpin</i>, the <i>partsuf</i> of the <i>sefirah Keter,</i> is the original divine will, which strives to advance the world toward its goal; <i>zeir anpin</i>, on the other hand, is the practical, "natural" governance of the world. The <i>partsuf aeir anpin</i> unites six <i>sefirot</i>, from <i>Hessed</i> to <i>Yesod</i>, which correspond to the six days of creation - that is, to the normal and natural functioning of the world. This is why the dialogue with God at this level is manifested in "natural" divine rule: justice, mercy, and the love of God; while at the level of <i>arikh anpin</i>, the original universal design is realized, in accordance with which a person must be part of the divine unity. (The level of <i>arikh anpin</i> cannot be attained when a person focuses only on self-examination, as the scale of a single life is simply too small for the "long dialogue" that encompasses human history.)<br><br><i>Zeir anpin</i> is "impatient," in that it consists of short-term reward and punishment, a shifting balance between sins and merits, mercy, and justice. At the level of <i>arikh anpin</i> the question of justice does not exist, as everything is one - and everything is meaningful, divine, and good. Therefore, in the dialogue with God at the level of <i>zeir anpin</i>, good and evil are distinct: this is good, this is bad; for this you are rewarded, for this punished; this advances the world, this impedes its progress - and that is, indeed, how the world functions locally. <i>Arikh anpin</i>, however, is the all-encompassing unity of the world, in which evil simply does not remain, as there is no room for it (and for this reason, there is no question of justice). For more on this, see paragraph 97.
Our task in the dialogue with God is to rise above the individual level to the national: to rise from <i>zeir anpin</i> to <i>arikh anpin</i>, from divine governance at the level of good and evil, to divine unity.

<b>When a person sins, that person is in the world of separation</b><br>A person sins when that person sees his or herself as a distinct entity - when every element of the universe is separate, and that person's self is severed from the source, from God: this is the "world of separation." Then evil, seen as separate, becomes, in fact, a discrete element of the locality and has the capacity to do harm. 
<i>Teshuvah</i> (repentance, return to God) springs from the awareness of universal connectedness and unity with God, which, as opposed to the "world of separation," is the "world of unification." "<i>Teshuvah</i> out of love" is not repentance due to fear of punishment, but from love of God and the desire to find connection with the Eternal.
"There is no evil at all": there is no room for the concept of "evil"; everything is an integral part of the good.
If we look at the universe holistically, as the "world of unification," rather than locally, as the "world of separation," it becomes clear that evil is necessary for the realization of good and in order for that good to reach a higher level. In the holistic view, evil does not exist in and of itself, as it is a necessary element of the overall system. When good overcomes an evil that has been impeding it, the good gains greater worth and deeper understanding; it attains a higher level. That evil, in the universal plan, ceases to be evil. Any evil is evil (and it is indeed evil!) only when it is viewed discretely; looked at holistically, it is a vital component of the good.
One who does <i>teshuvah</i> (repents) out of awe or fear - that person's premeditated sins are rendered as unwitting transgressions. One who does <i>teshuvah</i> out of love - that person's premeditated sins are rendered as merits" (Talmud, <i>Yoma</i> 86b), as, in the final account, these sins provide a reason for repentance and return and, thus, brought about movement to a higher level of spirituality.

<b>The feeling of love must develop in all of its details</b><br>In order to apprehend God's higher love, one must first develop the feeling of love itself. If the feeling of love is not developed in a person, that person will not be able to apprehend God's higher love.
If one does not develop an aesthetic sense, one will not be able to apprehend divine beauty at a high level. 
Secular literature or philosophy
The generation wants to develop itself, to apprehend beauty and love.
A person who does not grow spiritually, who does not read secular literature, cannot develop a sense of the awe or of love, so as to apprehend God's glory at the necessary level. Such as person will perceive God at a low level and will be unable to advance from there. Therefore, the literature and philosophy of one's generation and the desire to comprehend the beauty and richness of the world are necessary components of spiritual development. In other words, in this excerpt Rav Kook presents the radical idea that secular literature is needed not in order - as some religious people believe - to learn how nonreligious people live and how to change their mind, or to acquire techniques for influencing the outside world, but for one's own religious and spiritual development. This is not a matter of "pragmatism," but of the inherent value of literature and art, and their importance to the apprehension of the divine. In this sense, we must note that the Torah and commandments, also, are not ends in themselves, but paths to holiness. Thus, in some sense, secular literature and Torah are part of the same spiritual realm.

Comment 112

<b>To provide a contrast to those studious people who are scrupulous about constant perseverance</b><br>In other words, religious study alone is not sufficient for the development of a people. Another strength must also be developed, one that illuminates the soul in life - in tranquility, in the expansion of the mind, and so forth. In addition to the strict study of Torah - which is also necessary - a free spirit must also exist, striving, in particular, for the "common" pleasures of life (i.e., physical, emotional, intellectual, and so forth), as without these life is incomplete. And when life is incomplete, Torah is incomplete.
In the 1983 edition, this was revised to "spiritual journeys" in order to emphasize that these travels in the state of Israel must be filled with a spirit of holiness. However, the phrase does not refer to something purely speculative, but to actual, physical traveling, with spiritual attributes.<br><br>Without life's common pleasures, study of Torah is impossible. It is not study of Torah that stands in opposition to nature that brings blessings to the world, but that which harmonizes with it. For a more detailed discussion of the difference (in regard to the natural) between the nature of holiness in <i>galut</i> and in <i>Erets Israel</i>, see <i>Poetry of Being</i> by Yosef ben Shlomo, Chapter 9, "The Two Kinds of Holiness; The Problem of Evil."

<b>When set against the supernal, divine truth, there is no difference whatsoever between imagined faith and heresy</b><br>"Imagined faith" is faith that offers a representation of God, portraying God in one way or another. For more detail, see <i>Poetry of Being</i> by Yosef ben Shlomo, Chapter 3, "The Rational and the Irrational."
That is, like atheism, primitive representational faith is as far as can be from truth; in comparison with divinity, they are equally false.
In other words, from the point of view of divinity, there is no difference between primitive faith and atheism - both are wrong. But from the human point of view, they are wrong in different ways: one leans toward goodness and truth, the other toward evil and falsehood.
That is, the wicked stumble in the very place where the righteous pass.
Rather than to the level of the divine, as God created the world so that humanity could live and act in it.
That is, in relation to the light of the Infinite One, the difference is insignificant.
This is because atheism draws its spiritual strength from the rejection of primitive religiosity, which is, in essence, religious activity. The person who becomes a real, independent atheist is one whose spiritual demands are so high that that person does not tolerate primitive faith. For this reason, such a person's atheism contains within it the supernal radiance.
The words "transform bitterness to sweetness" were added in the 1983 edition to emphasize that atheism is not good in itself, but that people of a higher level of spirituality, who have become atheists purely because the religion they have been taught is too primitive for them (and they are therefore unable to accept it) extract from atheism sparks of a higher good, and in that way transform their lack of faith into elements of supernal light.

<b>When [our] divine enlightenment is small</b><br>This occurs, for instance, when a person pictures God as a pedantic judge, concerned above all with obedience to God's commands, incessantly monitoring people's submission. Such an image of God as the supreme overseer is a monstrous primitivization of both God and the person who so imagines the divine. (See also <i>First Journal</i>, <i>Shemonah Kevatsim</i> I, paragraph 75.)
Inasmuch as all people imagine themselves in relation to their idea of God (after all, God created humans in the divine image and likeness), those who picture God as small see themselves as utterly insignificant.
In other words, fear of God without breadth of understanding causes a person to feel worthless.
For a religious person not only is it not forbidden to study everything that exists, it is commanded.
Rav Kook is speaking here of the person who, having knowledge of all human culture, remains true to the Torah, and builds his worldview on its foundation.
If we interpret the words of the Torah too narrowly, we will not be able to build a full-blooded life; we therefore need to apprehend it "in its most absolute breadth."
This refers to such risks as the danger that knowledge of the wide world can lead to rejection of Judaism.
In other words, the person who fears everything will achieve nothing, whereas only the person who understands that truth in is the Torah, but at the same time studies other cultures, languages, and learning, distinguishing and sifting the good from the bad, can rectify the world.

<b>It is proper to yearn to be bound to the entire nation of Israel</b><br>A "preponderance of judgments" (<i>gevura, din</i>): scrutinizing the behavior of others for adherence to halakha and the Torah law. If one evaluates others in this way, one's smallness is revealed. <i>Gevura</i> is the "left side" (see a parallel statement in paragraph 67).
Inasmuch as many Israelis do not observe halakha, such a person will be unable to connect with this nonobservant society. The path proposed by Rav Kook is to observe the halakha strictly oneself, but refrain from judging others on the basis of their observance, as this would render impossible connection with other segments of society. Such a connection can form only on the basis of love (<i>hessed</i>).
What appears at the lower level to the person who judges surroundings based on halakha, in fact contains within itself a very important light - insufficiently "refined" perhaps, but very potent. And without connection to that level such a person lacks "fullness of light," without which that person cannot attain any higher level.
In connection with paragraph 126, we could say here that the person who judges others based on their observance lowers God to the level of simple "law," thus rendering God "small." (That is, such a person imagines God merely as one who punishes and rewards. In this way, a person brings down the highest divine holiness, and therefore cannot rise to the highest level and become one with the divine. See also paragraphs 129, 163, 184.)

Comment 129

<b>A great soul yearns to spread over everything</b><br>The more it reaches down to the lower, simple regions of life, to the realization and materialization of all things, the more it increases its own spiritual stature.
It rises to the level of <i>hessed</i> (which evaluates all phenomena in life not according to their adherence to Judaism today, but to the progress that they can lead to), and this places it in a positive relationship with all things. The elevation of the soul, made possible, in part, by its assimilation of the lower, material regions, is necessary for correct advancement toward the future; with the help of this the soul can make straight all paths and show that from the perspective of an orientation to the future, there is spiritual and religious meaning in many things in the world which do not seem to us today to be of religious value. See also paragraphs 21, 128, and 163.
The term "smaller souls" refers to people who cannot see in perspective, but are occupied only with observing limitations.
Because they believe that to stretch into these lower regions of existence is not in accordance with their narrow view of Judaism.
Because this great soul does not wish to harm the existing forms of religious and social organization (as it considers these also to be of value, despite the fact that they sometimes obstruct its progress), it avoids coming into direct confrontation with these "small, narrow-minded people."
Although it cannot always act according to its own higher ideals, inside itself, at least, it must remain faithful to them.
And because it is filled with this hope, it emanates, disseminating hope all around, and in this way helps to move the world forward.
If one does not climb to the heights of the world, one cannot attain the heights of the soul.

<b>Morality will not stand without its source</b><br>The infinite divine light by itself is perfect; however, in order for it to appear to us in this world it must be "rectified" accordingly, and this "rectification" occurs by means of the manifestation of the universes, as only in such universes (and with their aid) are we able to apprehend it. In other words, somewhat paradoxically, by means of the creation of universes the infinite divine light is advanced, developed, and improved (rectified) - not in relation to itself (which is unnecessary, as it is already perfect), but in relation to us, in that we now, with the help of the universes, can apprehend it. This remarkably radical theological idea is one aspect of Rav Kook's mysticism - his vision of the unity of creation, which views this world as an integral part of eternity, and the temporal as necessary for the realization and manifestation of eternity, rather than as superfluous to it or impeding it.
In other words, morality and ethics do not merely spring from a connection with God; they cannot continue to exist without that connection. If the link is broken, morality will begin to wither. An individual person may be quite ethical and moral without connection to God. However, if a secular concept of morality destroys the connection (and morality begins to be based on such ideas as "evident standards of decency," "live and let live," or Kant's Categorical Imperative), then within the framework of society ethics will gradually lose their life force, fade and wilt, and finally become unstable and disintegrate - just as trees, when it ceases to rain, do not immediately wither but remain green for a time and, at a glance, may appear to be thriving without rain, but cannot last long this way. For more detail see also <i>Poetry of Being</i> by Yosef ben Shlomo, Chapter 8, "The Profane Spirit and the Ethics of Holiness."
Since the divine is boundless, it cannot be fully expressed in any one tradition. Therefore, it must be expressed in various forms and must take on a different character with each nation or group. Accordingly, other non-Jewish forms of religious tradition are far from mere "mistakes" or misunderstandings of God on the part of other peoples. The existence of these other traditions is important, as our own Jewish tradition, being realized and formalized, is inevitably limited in comparison with the boundless divine. This radical religious pluralism is an essential element of Rav Kook's theology.
That is, the unity that runs through the various religious and spiritual models must overcome all differences, as "God will be one and His Name will be one" (<i>Zechariah</i> 14:9). In other words, Rav Kook's religious pluralism is more than simply an acknowledgment that that there are many acceptable approaches. In the future manifestation of unity ("must necessarily vanquish") all of this variety will not be an array of differences, but one unified picture.<br><br><b>Concluding notes: </b>Three main ideas can be distinguished in this paragraph:<br><br>1. (a fairly ordinary idea that has been repeated by other writers): that morality will wither if it is severed from its divine source<br><br>2. (fairly radical): that the infinite light is rectified by means of the manifestation of the universes.<br><br>3. (extremely radical): that any limited, formalized conception is incomplete and, therefore, that religious pluralism is a necessity<br><br>The second and third ideas spring from Rav Kook's vision of the parts of the universe as an integral part of the positive manifestation of God.

<b>There is a quality within the particular individuality of every person that is higher and more elevated than [the quality] of the communal nature that exists in the nation</b><br>Each person's individuality is at a higher level (at least in some specific aspect) than society as a whole.
The right way to advance a society is to support the individuals who are strong or outstanding in each area, and never to try to lower those individuals to the average level.
Although in his teachings, Rav Kook often points to the importance of society (including the spiritual importance of Klal Yisrael, the collective of all peoples of Israel), in this fragment he emphasizes that this must not lead to distortions. One must not diminish oneself for the sake of society, much less see oneself merely as a cog in a machine. Rather, people must know that they carry a trait that is at a higher level in them than in society as a whole, and that in this area they must not succumb to social norms (which are below their level), but must lead society, enliven it, and take responsibility for its development.

<b>All descents of supernal tzadikim from their glory</b><br>That is, descent occurs because a <i>tzadik</i>, or righteous person, has not sufficiently intensified the trait of supernal kindness, and reacts to something with excessive severity. See also paragraphs 129 and 194.
Although there is much that is wrong in the world, when <i>tzadikim</i> look at the world, they must find the positive that exists even in bad situations, and they must reveal the good within. And by finding and strengthening the positive elements in such situations, they sweeten, somewhat, the bitterness and illuminate the dark. This is the correct approach in terms of <i>hessed</i>. But if, instead of adding light, a <i>tzadik</i> becomes judgmental of the wrong in the world - in other words, when a <i>tzadik</i> reveals <i>gevura</i> - then that trait will pollute him or her with its critical and negative approach to the world, and that person's level will descend.
Since <i>tzadikim</i> are the "foundations of the world" (Proverbs 10:25), their perception of a situation will strongly influence those around them and thus will affect the situation itself.
When people begin to see (after being shown by a <i>tzadik</i>) the positive aspect in a situation that had seemed very bad, they relate to it differently. It often happens that when looked at in isolation, a thing or event seems negative, but when we see its connection with other things as part of a unified world, joined to all of history, its positive meaning is revealed. Then people are faced with less bitterness and trouble to overcome: this is the sweetening of bitterness. For example, Rav Kook wrote during the First World War that for all of the war's horrors, it was opening the path to the building of a Jewish homeland. War is a very bad thing, but it can ultimately pave the way for something better - in this case, for a restructuring of the world that would lead to the return of the Jewish people, after 2,000 years of exile, to its homeland. With such an approach, the bitterness of war is sweetened by hopefulness.

<b>The essence of hearing the voice of God is that we take heed of the entire process of the ways of life</b><br>To hear the voice of God is to carry on a dialogue with God in one's life. This dialogue is the essence of religion. 
To hear the voice of God, to heed the voice of God, is to heed the ways in which God is manifested in the flow of daily life, both on the individual level and on the social and national levels.
Wisdom's most important function is not to dictate a system of behavior, but to enable the person to personally hear the voice of God; and this voice instructs, provides a personal mission and task, and reveals the path that one must follow.

<b>When people think about divinity, at times their thought proceeds in a form that negates the world</b><br><i>Gevura</i> (literally "might") is one of the <i>sefirot</i>. It refers to judgment, law, severity, restraint, and limitation. From a strict point of view, the world is absolutely nothing in comparison with God, and a person who falls into the category of <i>gevura</i> in one's thoughts and feelings toward God will have a tendency to reject this world as insignificant.
<i>Hessed</i> (literally kindness) refers to openness, generosity, kindness, and grace.
In other words, two approaches are contrasted here: that of <i>gevura</i> and that of <i>hessed</i>. The approach based on <i>gevura</i>, which sees the world as insignificant in relation to the divine, is too severe; it reveals only the basic parts and overlooks the fine points. With the approach of <i>hessed</i>, the view becomes more nuanced; the temporal is understood as part of eternity, and the meaning and value of the world, which now exists in harmony with, rather than in opposition to, the divine, is transformed.
The approach based on <i>gevura</i> is not "entirely wrong"; however, it is at a lower level. It is important to remember that <i>gevura</i> itself is derived from <i>hessed</i>, and so should not be taken on its own, but with an awakening of its root, <i>hessed</i>, thus raising oneself (and the whole world) to its higher source. See also paragraphs 1, 27, 128, 129, 141, and 163.

<b>At times, a person cannot engage in learning Torah</b><br>That is, a person so longs to be united with the supernal divinity, which cannot be formalized, that he distances himself from the material world and becomes unable even to take part in ordinary, formally structured religious activity.
That is, one must prepare one's soul to recognize and receive this light.
"Lines" and "points" are Kabbalistic terms. A "point" is an original idea, and a "line" is that idea's further development and revelation. The higher <i>sefirot</i> (and likewise, those worlds that are at a higher level than others) are points that contain an original idea in a compressed form; the lower <i>sefirot</i> are lines, disseminating these ideas. Here, then, Rav Kook tells us that the light of "heavenly desires" (that is, the original divine will, or <i>Keter</i>, which gives life to the universe), must gradually take its form by passing through the structure of worlds.
In the process of being drawn down, the supernal light must take form so as to be in harmony with the spiritually positive aspects of ordinary life, with the normal structure of the natural, lower world.
In this situation, the striving for supernal light will not reject the ordinary world (as may occur in the situation described at the beginning of this paragraph) but, rather, supplement, improve, organize, and enliven it.

<b>Trivial matters can be elevated only by means of the revelation of secrets of Torah</b><br><i>Devarim betelim</i>, meaning "trivial matters," is a phrase used in classical Jewish religious literature to refer to purely worldly, everyday things that bear no relation to holiness.
That is, "trivial matters" cannot be raised by means of general religious practice such as halakha. This can be done only by means of the secrets of the Torah, when deep study of the internal meaning of its commandments and ideals supplements ordinary religious practice. (For more on the expression "secrets of the Torah," see the commentary to paragraph 21.)
Because study of the secrets of the Torah reveals the light hidden in the depths of the universe, even trivial matters that seem to be insubstantial will be elevated. This occurs effortlessly, as the place of these matters in the scheme of the universe and in the plan of creation becomes clear, revealing the meaning of their existence.
See <i>Sotah</i> 49b. That is, at the beginning of the era of the Messiah (see paragraph 2), classical Jewish wisdom (literally "the wisdom of the scribes," Judaism of the book) will lose its attraction and its freshness; it will fade and rot, unable to manage the elevation of trivial matters.
And therefore many strong personalities will reject classical wisdom, turning their powers and creative energy instead to secular literature and the building of society.
In other words, things that seemed to be insignificant in the period before the light of the Messiah will now reveal their inner meaning and potential. This is due to the fact that the light of the Messiah (see paragraph 21) values things based not on their degree of accordance with the law or formalized sanctity, but on their contribution to the building of the future ideal.
See Ezekiel 47:12. That is, both the results (fruits) and the simple actions (leaves) of these "trivial matters" will be needed and called upon for the general rectification and improvement of the world.

That is, positive elements will unquestionably be found in any such movement.

<b>There are certain rectifications of the world that cannot be accomplished by tzadikim</b><br>These people are indifferent to spirituality and holiness; they are concerned only with their own material success; nonetheless, they move the world forward.
The Jewish tradition distinguishes <i>teshuvah</i> out of fear of punishment from <i>teshuvah</i> out of love for the supernal. The latter is founded on the desire to help realize divine paths in the world. It therefore provides the <i>tzadikim</i> with a means to participate in the rectification of the world.
That is, the condition of the world today, in which the needed material rectifications are carried out by those who are wicked or far from holiness, is flawed; and it will be a great blessing if <i>tzadikim</i> are able to do this work. However, the <i>tzadikim</i> are not yet ready; they must carry out deep <i>teshuvah</i> to open this path for themselves.

<b>Spiritual rebellion will take place in the land of Israel</b><br>This is an internal tradition, which has been passed on to us from the sages of previous generations.
The "spiritual rebellion" will be a rebellion against classical spirituality - but its purpose will be to change the paradigm of spirituality and to raise it to a new level.
That is, the beginning of the era of the Messiah
That is, the material success of religious Zionism
See <i>Sotah</i> 49b.
That is, most people are fully consumed by immediate material desires.
The secular pioneers' initial enthusiasm will dissipate.
That is, a crisis of national scale, a catastrophe
It will be apparent that Israel cannot save itself without the help of God.
It is the holy that will rescue and support the mundane. 
The religious aspect, which at first seemed to be opposed to secular Zionism, will be recognized as essential for the Jewish people's survival in the land of Israel.
That is, the necessity of this spiritual development will lead to rebellion against spirituality.
In exile.
That is, each individual, of course, was concerned with material life, but the people as a whole had no opportunity to engage with such things.
The desire to build the material life of the people.
It will trample everything else.
It will inevitably bring about a crisis.

<b>Faith with which intellect does not agree arouses anger and cruelty</b><br>That is, faith that contradicts reason, or that demands belief without reflection, especially antirational faith (i.e., belief because it is absurd).
And if a person (or society) accepts this type of faith, a deep conflict between faith and reason will arise in one's soul, leading to strong tension in subconscious that might break through to the surface in the form of anger or even cruelty.
In Hebrew <i>aluv</i>: demeaned, wretched, impoverished, pathetic
Because the acceptance of such faith debases and insults reason, reason (despite the fact that it was overpowered and suppressed) cannot internally be reconciled. Then the accumulated inner pressure bursts through in the form of anger and cruelty.
Supernal faith is unattainable by reason, just as reason cannot grasp the ways of God. Supernal faith cannot be formalized, whereas lower faith is formalized, and must therefore accord with reason.
That is, the clear sense of the divine manifestation allows reason to step aside without a sense of injury.
That is, in this situation, the lower, ordinary faith, on one hand, springs from the transcendence of reason, and on the other, it does not contradict reason.
The process of supernal faith's descent into lowly faith is its formalization, which, as noted above, must not be in contradiction to reason. Rav Kook emphasizes that reason must not be neglected; it must be seriously considered, not replaced by feelings or imagination.
This is a reference to Rachel and Leah, "both of whom built up the House of Israel" (Ruth 4:11). Rachel (who embodies beauty, Joseph, spirit expressed through material achievement) represents the visible world, and Leah (who is known for "weak eyes," Yehuda, David, the spirit of <i>teshuvah</i> - remorse, stepping across the material) represents the concealed world. Only the unification of these two aspects can set the Jewish people on the right path.

<b>When one truly looks at the good aspect of every individual</b><br>Such a person genuinely likes people and does not flatter at all.
That is, one sees the good in other people.
See Proverbs 12:16. That is, in order to really love people, one must always look at their good side, and then that love will be natural and unforced.

<b>Heresy’s spirit of smashing through barriers purifies all of the infection</b><br>The verb <i>lifrots</i> means literally "to break down a barrier"; <i>pritsut</i> is the destruction of barriers, depravity. This term usually denotes a rejection of religion, a breaking of religious rules. In this case, however, Rav Kook uses it to suggest a wind that blows through everything and cleanses it. He is speaking here of the fresh spirit of atheism.
The wind of atheism will cleanse the lower levels of faith, to which primitive, simplistic religiosity has become attached, as atheism ridicules and destroys primitive faith. But in so doing, it merely clears the space for the building of deep and more developed faith.
The song of the world is the poetic truth that exists. Rav Kook believes that poetry can convey what is essential, while prose merely describes and systematizes what is revealed through "the song" (for a more detailed discussion see <i>Poetry of Being</i> by Yosef ben Shlomo, Chapter 2, "The General Character of Rabbi Kook's Philosophy.<i>"</i>) When the heavens are purified, supernal faith will be revealed and the song of the world and truth of the world will become clearer.

<b>“I am in the midst of the exile”</b><br>Rav Kook uses a line from Ezekiel, who received prophesy during his exile in Babylon, as the basis for the reflection that our inner "I" is found in exile.
Characteristic of all of Rav Kook's teachings is the view of the people as a unified national organism, a national personality. Hence he stresses the parallel between the revelation of the "I" of the individual and of the community (the people).
"Its own": that is, the revelation of holiness and purity in its own soul, not introduced from outside.
"Within it": the more holiness and purity a person or society has, the more supernal light it can receive. Real holiness is linked to the realization of one's own divine nature at the individual and national level.
The serpent personifies the inner passions of the soul, distinct from a person's true essence. In the Garden of Eden, it was still possible to separate these inner passions from the essence of the person; when the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was consumed, these passions entered the person, and it became much more complicated to differentiate them from the self.
In accordance with this archetype, every sin constitutes the loss of one's true essence.
As Israel, both as an individual and as a national entity, draws its "I" from the divine essence, in bowing to false idols it betrays itself.
This refers to the Midrash, according to which it was originally intended that the earth would produce "the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind" (Genesis 1:11), such that the tree itself should have been edible as fruit, but the earth "willfully" misbehaved, creating trees "yielding fruit" (Genesis 1:12), on which only the fruit was edible, rather than the tree. Thus the earth's sin preceded human's sin, and the earth was punished together with the humans when they were banished from the garden: "Cursed is the ground for thy sake... Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee" (Genesis 3:17 - 18).
That is, the earth wanted to achieve faster results and so put everything into the fruit, rather than the tree, creating a situation that was unstable, and leading to destruction and the fall.
This refers to the Midrash, according to which God originally intended to create two lights of equal size ("And God made two great lights" (Genesis 1:16)), but the moon complained that two kings could not share a crown, for which it was immediately reduced in size. This is why the Torah continues, "the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night."
That is, pedagogues are concerned only with the transfer of knowledge to the student, rather with developing their "I."
A person who has no (developed) self cannot come to know the world. (Knowledge of the world is based on the relationship "I - He.")
A person who has no (developed) self cannot enter into a dialogue with God (which is the relationship "I - You").
These lines from Lamentations emphasize that the Messiah does not come from without; he is the embodiment of the inner development of the Jewish people, its immanent essence, "the breath of our nostrils." (In Lamentations, this refers directly to Zedekiah, who was king of Israel at the time of the destruction of the First Temple, but at the same time it explains an important aspect of the idea of the Messiah.)
That is, the religious quest is not carried out through denial of self, or submission to an external power, but through the realization of one's own potential.
To know is not to receive external information; it is the creation and activation of connection within oneself. For this reason, knowledge is developed only through the development of the "I." When we find and purify our "I," we become able to know God, who has led us from Egypt, from (internal) slavery to freedom.

<b>There are three stages upon which the individual and collective perfection of Israel must be based</b><br>In other words, there are three things that we have not yet attained (writes Rav Kook at the beginning of the twentieth century, at the beginning of the process of the Jewish people's return to the land of Israel). Until we achieve these three goals, we will not be able to attain perfection in our individual and national existence.<br><br>Over the past 100 years, we have made some progress on the third area (in the national consciousness) but we have yet to develop in the realms of "nature" and "human morality."
For a discussion of the problem of the opposition between "holiness" and "nature," see <i>Poetry of Being</i> by Yosef ben Shlomo, Chapter 6, "The Moral Tendency of Being," and Chapter 7, "The Spiritual and the Material: The Sacred and the Profane."
That is, there exists a natural human morality, and religion must accord with that, not contradict it.
The sense of a national dialogue with God; for a more detailed discussion, see P. Polonsky, <i>Religious Zionism of Rav Kook</i>.
These are the three most important things that Israel must attend to, both individually and as a people. This signifies that the Jews have lost these three qualities in exile. Therefore, we must return to nature, rather than sitting only within the walls of the house of learning; to human morality, rather than asserting that only what concerns the Jewish people should be of importance to us; and to national consciousness.

<b>As the spirit of freedom grows more at home in the world</b><br>That is, when it becomes a legal, recognized part of the surrounding social, economic, judicial, and spiritual landscape.
Here we see, first, the combining of the concept of <i>ratson</i> (will) with <i>hofesh</i> (freedom), that is, will combined with freedom. Freedom is a characteristic of God, and the supernal divine will is connected with the supernal divine freedom. In accordance with this, the personal freedom of the individual is a reflection, a local manifestation of this universal supernal divine freedom. God is free in Himself, and therefore, when one acts more freely, one is closer to God than when one acts under duress. When one acts freely, one draws nearer to God and so feels better. When one acts under duress, one distances one's self from God, and so feels worse.
Because gratitude is necessary and must always be preserved; it is precisely when a person becomes completely free, and thus manifests goodness, that one experiences gratitude.
In other words, all future sacrifices must be integrated with thanksgiving sacrifices, as, when a person is truly free, that person is filled above all with a feeling of gratitude for all he or she has received. In this sense, the most important approach to the world is gratitude.
