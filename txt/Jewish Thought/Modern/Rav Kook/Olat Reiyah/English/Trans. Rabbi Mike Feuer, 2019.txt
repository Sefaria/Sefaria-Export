The Constant Prayer of the Soul

<b>The constant prayer of the soul</b><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">There are three primary aspects of soul which Rav Kook addresses in the introduction. When appropriate, neshama has been left in transliteration, ruach translated as spirit,  nefesh as vital soul. Here are examples of how Rav Kook uses these terms elsewhere.<br>נשמה – התכונה הרוחנית העליונה של שפעת חיי המחשבה והרצון, המתעלה בעילוי האלוקי (ע"ר א טו)<br>The neshama is the highest spiritual aspect, the outpouring of the life of thought and will which rises up in Divine elevation (see Olat Reiyah I p.15)<br>רוח – הרצון (ע"ר א רנ), מכון השכל (שם קיט) <br>The ruach is the will (ibid p.250), the dwelling place of the intellect (ibid p.119)<br>נפש – היסוד התמציתי של החיים הטבעיים (ע"ר א יז), מכון הרצון (ע"ר א קיט)<br>The nefesh is the essential foundation of natural life (ibid p.17), and the dwelling place of the will (ibid. 119)<br>See this source text from Olay Reiyah<br>Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul and all your might<br>The heart is the dwelling place of the spirit (ruach), and the essence and primary foundation of choice reside in the aspect of ruach, which is the definitive level of humanity. Through the ruach the vital soul (nefesh) is elevated, drawing down upon itself more of the light of the higher soul (neshama). The place of the ruach and the nefesh is within man’s body, and they are certainly bounded by it. But the neshama can never in its entirety enter the body, rather the embodied intellect is illuminated by her sparks, because in her greatness she cannot enter into and be limited by any vessel. The vessel cannot bear the light, and this is why she is called ‘might,’ which indicates something abundant and magnified. This is the precision of meaning found in the homily of our Sages: ’and all your might (m’odecha)’ with every measure (middah) which He measures (moded) out for you.” The feeling of love in the heart could never be from the aspect of the nefesh, certainly not toward something which might cause one pain. So too, the love of a sick person for the doctor who amputates a painful limb does not flow from the nefesh, because one’s nefesh suffers from this act. Rather it comes from the ruach, the will that receives its impression only after awareness of the ultimate good which flows from this act has been fixed in one’s intellect. But the love of God must be magnified by things whose ultimate good cannot be quantified, but rather simply draw us toward the love of His great glory. This cannot be impressed on the will and is also not possible from the perspective of ruach, but rather only ‘with all your might,’ which is the neshama, can such a love come, where for every measure that He measures out for you, you can be filled with a mighty gratitude, through the exalted value of the highest intellectual feeling.<br>ואהבת את ד' אלהיך בכל לבבך ובכל נפשך ובכל מאדך.<br>הלב הוא משכן הרוח ,ועקר הבחירה וראשית יסודה הוא בבחינת הרוח,שהוא מדרגת האדם, וע"י הרוח מתרוממת הנפש, וממשיך עליו יותר אור הנשמה. והנה הנפש והרוח מקומם בגוף האדם ומוגבלים בו בודאי, אבל הנשמה אי אפשר כלל שתכנס בשלמותה בגוף, רק מאיר ממנה אור בניצוץ השכל המורגש בגוף, כי לפי גדולתה אי אפשר לה להכנס בכלי ולהגבל בו ולא יוכל הכלי לסבול את האור, ולכן היא נקראת בשם מאד שהוא מורה על הרבוי וההפלגה. ולפיכך מכוונת היא דרשת רז"ל בכל מאדך בכל מדה ומדה שהוא מודד לך. כי הרגש האהבה שבלב אי אפשר כלל שיהיה מצד הנפש למה שהוא מרגיש ממנו דבר מכאיב, כמו שאהבת החולה לרופא החותך אבר המכאיב אינה מצד הנפש, שהרי נפשו מצטערת במעשה זה, רק מצד הרוח שהוא הרצון המתרשם אחרי שכבר נקבעה בהכרת השכל תכלית הטוב היוצא מזה. אבל אהבה להשי"ת צריכה להתגבר מצד דברים שלא ישער כלל תכלית טובם, רק ימשך לאהבת כבודו הגדול לבדו, וזה לא יתרשם בחלק הרצון ולא יתכן גם מצד הרוח, רק בכל מאדך, שהיא הנשמה, תוכל לבוא אהבה זו, אשר על כל מדה ומדה שהוא מודד לך תהא מודה לו במאד מאד, ברוממות ערך ההרגשה השכלית העליונה.</i><br>The constant<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The vision of prayer as one’s natural state of being is rooted in the second story of creation, particularly as read through the midrashic lens provided by Rashi (see Bereshit 2:4-8 with Rashi). Rashi (on 2:5), in the words of the midrash, makes it clear all of creation is in a state of potential, in a state of ‘not yet.’ Even the rains themselves await the prayer of man. Rashi then outlines a process in which prayer is man’s tool for moving creation from potential to actual. He says that man was needed to begin working the ground, to see the goodness that rain could bring, to feel its lack in the world and then turn to G–d in prayer. There is a practical approach to prayer which can be explored in this structure, but the question here is – how was Adam to know that rain was good if it had never yet fallen? The answer comes in lines 6 and 7. When G–d forms Adam from the dust of the earth, Rashi notes that the mist which rose from the ground allowed G–d to knead the raw substance of Adam into his form. This means that the water which the world required, which the prayer of man was meant to evoke, was the very stuff of Adam’s being. “The very waters that man is going to pray for, become the stuff of which he is made. Do you realize how deep that is? And I believe the deep understanding of that, is that man is made of that which he prays for in his most initial prayer, because the world, so to speak, produces man, so that man will pray for it.” R. Daniel Kohn</i> prayer of the <i>neshama</i> strives continually to move from hidden to revealed, to spread over all the forces of life of the spirit and of the vital soul, and all the powers of embodied life. She yearns as well to reveal her essence and the power of her actions over all her surroundings, over all the world and life, and toward this end we require the accounting of the world (See Baba Batra 78b) which comes through Torah and wisdom. And so we find that the whole work of the Torah and all its wisdom is the constant revelation of the hidden prayer of the <i>neshama</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Notice that this is a revolution in the traditional understanding of the relationship between Torah learning and prayer. Here the purpose of learning appears to be to give us an orderly conception of the world which will then allow the soul’s prayer to reveal itself to the fullest. Compare to the Maharal at the very end of Netiv haTemimot “Torah comes from the highest source, where as tefillah is the inner source itself, which reaches to the source of highest blessing…”</i>. “Let the breath of all life (<i>nishmat kol chay</i>) bless Your name, oh Lord our G–d…”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The poem Nishmat kol chay is said at the transition in Shabbat morning prayer between psukei d’zimra (songs of preparatory praise) and the acceptance of Divine kingship that comes through saying Shema Yisrael and its blessings. See translation at the end of this comment for more on this transition. <br>The oldest reference to the poem is found on gem. Pesachim 118a, where R. Yochanan says it is the “blessing of the song” named by the Mishna as the concluding blessing to Hallel of seder night, which it remains in the present Haggadah. The standard translation is “let the breath of all living things bless Your name…” In light of the role that the soul’s prayer plays in giving voice to all creation (see paragraphs 6 &amp; 7 in this section) R’ Kook is pointing a reading as – “let the breath of all Life bless Your Name… (through the soul which reveals herself in prayer as an engagement of the wholeness of creation.) <br>See Olat Reiyah, Pesukei dezimra 122 .</i>
Prayer comes in its perfected form only with the consciousness that the <i>neshama </i>is always praying<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">“For a person to be praying without this awareness is almost as if prayer is unnatural to his condition, and unnatural to the condition of the world, but for a person to pray with the awareness that really all the time I’m in the state of prayer, it’s just there are times when that comes to manifestation and times when it does not, is to recognize that I’m embedded in something which is the ongoing reality of myself – which is a whole different relationship with the act of praying. It’s not something which is external to what I am. When I come to pray, this is what I am, this is happening now not because I’ve been told to do it, not because I’m under obligation to do it, not even because I currently have a need to be doing it, but rather that all of those circumstances are actually the means by which, and the context within which, I come to the fullness of the expression of what it is that I really am.” R. Daniel Kohn</i>. Does she not fly, and join to her beloved (Shir haShirim 8:5) without any break<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The word הפסק means that which separates. In Orot HaTorah 9:7, Rav Kook comments on the mishna in Pirke Avot 3:7 "Rabbi Yaakov said: One who walks on the road while learning and interrupts (ומפסיק) his learning and says: 'How beautiful is this tree! How beautiful is this plowed field!' – The Torah considers it as if is liable to death." He explains that there are many levels of the world. Individuals who possess exalted spirituality obviously see the light of G–d shining in a tree, but the light of G–d which is found in the Torah is even brighter. A tree contains life, but the Torah contains the very source of life. Rav Tzvi Yehudah Kook adds that everything depends on how one looks at the tree: Is it an independent creation detached from the source of life or is it connected to the Living G-d? The problem is when one "interrupts” his learning, meaning that he breaks his connection to G–d in order to relate to the tree as something separate and disconnected. (from R’ Zvi Yehudah Kook, L’Netivot Yisrael vol. 2, p. 144).</i> at all? It is only that, in the time of active prayer, the soul’s ceaseless prayer is revealed in actuality. This is her fineness and her pleasure, the glory and beauty of prayer, which is like a rose that opens its fair petals to greet the dew or the sun’s rays which appear on her in her radiance<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">“That’s the beauty, in a sense, of the circularity, or the relational aspect of prayer. It is a calling from G-d. It’s His sun shining on you which is then drawing out of you what it is that he has planted within you: that drive for fulfillment and for wholeness, which is reflected in words in tefillah. And so anytime you experience that movement towards growth and fulfillment, anytime you are expressing in your life, either an aspiration or an activity, that moving towards greater expression of what it is that you are, you are like this flower that is opening up….. But certainly it’s the case that when it comes to the Ribbono Shel Olam, who’s drawing out of our fulfillment, is as it were, drawing out His own fulfillment, because it is He who is us, who is in the expression of our souls.” R. Daniel Kohn</i>; therefore, “Oh, that one would pray all day long!” (Berachot 21a) <sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">“This means that prayer, in the externality of the halachic issue, is something you can do anytime, but in the inner understanding of it - prayer is something which is being done all the time” R. Daniel Kohn</i>
Prayer asks that the <i>neshama</i> fulfill her role. When days and years pass without properly aligned<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The term kavana is central to the practice of prayer, and difficult to translate. Common renderings as ‘focus’ or ‘intention’ strike me as indicative of a process centered outside the self (focus on… intention toward…) Alignment adds the sense of prayer as relationship and right inner orientation of self which allow something to flow through the self (alignment with...) See section 4:8, 11, 12 for further discussion, as well as footnote 17.</i> prayer, battering-stones<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 8:14. These are the stones which themselves do the damage, as opposed to the stumbling blocks to which they are joined in the verse (seen Malbim ad loc). Perhaps the proper image is that of a rock-like accretion which accumulates around the heart from a lack of proper prayer. Then when you reach for the heart, you hurt yourself on the hard, sharp surface that has built up. This pain breeds lethargy, meaning a lack of desire or motivation to try and touch the heart.</i> accumulate around the heart, through which we feel an inner spiritual lethargy. And when the good<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Translating the word tov as good is literally accurate, but not so helpful in understanding in context. This is because Hebrew is a word-poor language, and relies on context to communicate nuance of meaning. Therefore understanding the meaning of tov, where ever it is used, comes in context of its classic usages. In the first chapter of Genesis, before we hear of the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the tree of moral distinctions, there is good. When G–d looks at creation and sees that it is good, there is no evil to define it by contrast. This is good in the existential sense - that which perfectly conforms to the will of its Creator (see Rashi Bereshit 1:7מעל לרקיע ). Humanity does not have the perfection as a creator to fully actualize our inner conception of the good which we desire be. However, an essential expression of our Divine Image is the ability to recognize the potential good in the world, that which is in a state of “not yet,” and to bring it to fruition through prayer and action (see comments on Rashi Bereshit 2:5 in note 2). After the eating from the tree, our access to good comes through relative experience (good as opposed to evil), and our expression of good through words and deeds that move creation toward a state of deeper Divine intention. Thus the following two definitions offered by R’ Kook in Olat Reiyah Pesukei dezimra 14 -</i> spirit<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The good spirit can be understood as a type of Divine spirit which fills man, like ruach hakodesh. Compare Tehillim 143:10 with the comments of the Malbim and the Radak. For a parallel text from R’ Kook see Olat Reiyah, Modeh Ani 2.</i> returns, and the gift of prayer is given from above, we move forward with each prayer, removing the obstacles, and the many blockages which have gathered in the flowing river of the highest<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Translating the superlative עליונה poses a similar problem to translating טוב Here are some usages by R’ kook which may suggest its general meaning – <br>עליון – אידיאלי, אצלי, אלוקי (עפ"י א"ק ב שיג, ושם א רלב) רם במעלתו מכל העניינים הזעירים שלבני אדם (עפ"י ע"ר א קיג)<br>Transcendent – ideal, noble, G–dly (Orot Kodesh 2:313, 1:232) Elevated in its level from all the small, human matters (Olat Reiyah I p.113)<br>Additionally, it implies an ideal but dynamic state, one which lies beyond the ability to manifest, but toward which we may continually strive in an asymptotic relationship.</i> soul of life begin to clear.

Rather than acquiring something foreign to us, we are growing into something which was inherent but not yet attained.</i> as cures for the deficiencies of the past. Indeed, the lack is not filled all at once, but rather step by step, and the brilliance<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See Bereshit 6:16, and the midrash Bereshit Rabba 31:11 brought by Rashi on whether the tzohar in Noah’s ark was a window or a gemstone.

Prayer actualizes and brings to light, to complete life, that which is hidden in the depths of the <i>neshama</i>. And according to the measure of one’s inner purity, so is the magnitude of the impact of prayer’s appearance when their inner will<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Shulchan Aruch O’Ch 51:7 requires one to have kavana when saying the verse פותח את ידיך ומשביע לכל חי רצון. Typically this is translated as ‘You open your hand and satisfy the will of every living creature.’ But it can also be read as ‘You satisfy every creature with will.’ The clarification of our will is an essential aspect of prayer. When we tell children to pray for everything, it is because we want them to know that the first reading is true – that for G–d, anything is possible. But as we get older and begin to wonder if the things we want are worth praying for, then prayer becomes an opportunity for clarification of our deeper will. What is it that moves us to pray? There is another level of this question – what is the relationship between the Divine will and my will when I pray? If I am moved to pray because I believe that G–d is all-wise and powerful, then how could I possibly assert my will to say that something in the world ought to be other than He made it? See supplementary text in note 153. For more on kavana, see footnote 9 as well as sections 4:8, 11, 12 in the body of the text</i> emerges from their depths, as they turn to the Source of the life of all the souls and all the worlds. Great and wondrous is the effect of their expressions on life. A great light pours forth with a properly derived word,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See Shmonah Kvatzim, Kovetz 6:79<br>שטף הדבור<br>יט <br>האדם יכול לדעת את מעמדו הרוחני על פי הבהירות של הדיבור שלו. מה שהאור הנשמתי יותר חי בקרבו, כפי אותה המדה יחוש, איך כל דיבור ודיבור שלו יוצא כחץ, וכשטף מים חיים, ואיך שהוא בא ונמשך ממקור חיים, ופועל את פעולתו בעולם. מובן שהאיכות הפרטית של הפעולה של הדיבור תשוער על פי המדה הפרטית של העילוי הנשמתי, כל חד וחד לפום דרגיה. כשמדבר דברים קדושים, ובקרבו הוא מצטער מפני הופעת הקדושה שמשתפכת בקרבו , ידע שהנפש הטמאה היא מתמעטת והולכת, והיא מתכאבת על פחיתותה שפוחתת, וממילא הטוב מתגבר והולך. ובידיעה זו עצמה, ובאמונה והעמקה בה, הנפש הטהורה מתעוררת בשמחה, ויודעת שהיא מתקדשת ומתעלה, מתרחבת והולכת. ד' עז למו ומעוז ישועות משיחו הוא, ויעלז לבי ומשירי אהודנו. <br>Orot Hakodesh - The flow of speech<br>19. One can know their spiritual standing by the clarity of their expression. The more that the neshama’s light lives within them, to that extent they will feel how each word shoots like an arrow, like a flood of living waters, and how it is drawn from the source of life, making its impact in the world. It is understood that the particular quality of the affect which speech makes is measured by the specific standard of the neshama’s elevation, each according to their level. And when one speaks of holy matters, but feels discomfort because of the holy manifestation pouring out within, know that the impure soul is gradually shrinking away. It is this soul which is pained by its reduction, and of its own accord goodness progressively overcomes. And through this very knowledge, and the deep faith within it, the pure soul awakens in joy, knowing that it is becoming holy, rising up, and spreading out more and more. “The LORD is their strength; He is a stronghold for the deliverance of His anointed,” (Psalms 28:8) “…and my heart exulted, so I will glorify Him with my song.” (Ps. 28:7)</i> it is taken from secreted storehouses of a rich life, abundant in its opulence. And according to the depth of its inner penetration, so is the scope of the luminous flight which the word reveals, brings to being, births. The clarification of expression elucidates the particulars of this illumination, solidifies existence through a clear and specific desire, and things progressively come to be. It is impossible that prayer not make her impression. Whether she makes her impact according to her particular designated purpose, or sets in motion many complicated paths – these are the wondrous<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The first usage of peleh is Bereshit 18:14, see Rashi there who offers a definition based on nothing being disconnected from G–d. See also Tomer Devorah 1st chapter - she’erit nachalato. One understanding of peleh is the wonder evoked by opposites which when held in relationship evoke a sense of higher whole. On that note, see this vision of peace from Rav Kook - <br>אמר ר' אלעזר אמר ר' חנינא תלמידי-חכמים מרבים שלום בעולם, שנאמר וכל בניך למודי ד' ורב שלום בניך, אל תקרי בניך אלא בוניך.<br>(ברכות ס"ד.). יש טועים שחושבים, שהשלום העולמי לא יבנה כי-אם ע"י צביון אחד בדיעות ותכונות, וא"כ כשרואים ת"ח חוקרים בחכמה ודעת תורה, וע"י המחקר מתרבים הצדדים והשיטות, חושבים שבזה הם גורמים למחלוקת והפך השלום. ובאמת אינו כן, כי השלום האמתי אי אפשר שיבוא לעולם כי-אם דוקא ע"י הערך של רבוי השלום. הרבוי של השלום הוא, שיתראו כל הצדדים וכל השיטות, ויתבררו איך כולם יש להם מקום, כל אחד לפי ערכו, מקומו וענינו. ואדרבא גם הענינים הנראים כמיותרים או כסותרים, יראו כשמתגלה אמתת החכמה לכל צדדיה, שרק ע"י קיבוץ כל החלקים וכל הפרטים, וכל הדעות הנראות שונות, וכלהמקצעות החלוקים, דוקא על ידם יראה אור האמת והצדק, ודעת ד' יראתו ואהבתו, ואור תורת אמת. על-כן תלמידי חכמים מרבים שלום, כי במה שהם מרחיבים ומבארים ומילדים דברי חכמה חדשים, בפנים מפנים שונים, שיש בהם רבוי וחילוק ענינים, בזה הם מרבים שלום, שנאמר וכל בניך למודי ד'. כי כולם יכירו שכולם גם ההפכים בדרכיהם ושיטותיהם כפי הנראה, המה כולם למודי ד', ובכל אחת מהנה יש צד שתתגלה על ידו ידיעת ד' ואור אמתו. ורב שלום בניך, לא אמר גדול שלום בניך, שהיה מורה על ציור גוף אחד גדול, שאז היו הדברים מתאימים לאותו הרעיון המדומה, שהשלום הוא צריך דוקא לדברים אחדים ושיווי רעיונות, שזה באמת מגרע כח החכמה והרחבת הדעת, כי אור הדעת צריך לצאת לכל צדדיו, לכל הפנים של אורה שיש בו, אבל הרבוי הוא רב שלום בניך, אל תקרי בניך, אלא בוניך, כי הבנין יבנה מחלקים שונים, והאמת של אור העולם תבנה מצדדים שונים ומשיטות שונות, שאלו ואלו דברי אלהים חיים, מדרכי עבודה והדרכה וחנוך שונים, שכ"א תופס מקומו וערכו. ואין לאבד כל כשרון ושלמות כ"א להרחיבו ולמצא לו מקום, ואם תראה סתירה ממושג למושג, בזה תבנה החכמה ביתה, וצריך לעיין בדברים איך למצא את החוק הפנימי שבמושגים, שבזה יתישרו הדברים ולא יהיו סותרים זא"ז, ורבוי הדעות שבא ע"י השתנות הנפשות והחנוכים דוקא הוא הוא המעשיר את החכמה והגורם הרחבתה, שלסוף יובנו כל הדברים כראוי ויוכר שאי אפשר היה לבנין השלום שיבנה כ"א ע"י כל אותן ההשפעות הנראות כמנצחות זא"ז.<br>There are those who mistakenly think that world peace will only be built through a uniformity of opinion and perspective; when they see talmidei chachamim exploring through their wisdom and the knowledge of Torah, and these explorations lead to a multiplicity of sides and approaches, they think that this causes dispute and the opposite of peace. In truth this is not so, because true peace will never come to the world except through the value of multiplying peace. The multiplication of peace is that all the sides and all the methods should be seen, and it be clarified how each has its place, according to its value, place and interest. On the contrary, also that which appears superfluous or contradictory will been seen, when all the facets of true wisdom are revealed, only through the ingathering of all the pieces and particulars, and all the apparently divergent opinions, and all the divided disciplines, especially through them the light of truth and righteousness will appear, and the knowledge of G–d, love and awe of Him and the light of the Torah of truth. Therefore talmidei chachamim increase peace, because in that they expand, clarify and birth new words of wisdom, from different perspectives on diverse and distinct matters, they increase peace, as it says “all of your children will be taught of the Lord…” (Yishayahu 54:13). Because all will recognize that everyone, even those who are apparently opposite in their ways and approaches, they are all learners of G–d, each one reveals a facet to the knowledge of G–d and the light of His truth. “…And your children will have plentiful peace…” it does not say your children will have great peace, which would indicate the image of one great body; then the words would be fitting to that mistaken idea that peace requires uniformity and equivalation of ideas, which in truth reduces the power of wisdom and the expansion of consciousness, because the light of consciousness must unfold in every direction, toward all the facets of light that it contains. This multiplicity is ‘your children will have plentiful peace,’ do not read it as your children (banayich) but rather as your builders (bonyaich), because the structure will be built from different pieces, and the truth of the light of the world will be built from many sides and approaches, because these and those are the words of the living G–d; from various paths of service, and guidance and education, each of which fills its place and value. One should not destroy any ability or wholeness rather he should expand it and find its proper place, and if concepts appear contradictory, through this wisdom builds her house (Mishle 9:1); one needs to delve into how to find the inner precept which is in concepts, because in this, things will be rectified and no longer contradict, and the multiplication of opinions which comes through the differences of soul and education is exactly what enriches wisdom and drives its expansion. In the end all things will be properly built and it will be recognized that the construct of peace was impossible to build except through those influences which appear to battle one another for victory. (Olat HaReiyah)</i> works of the One perfect in knowledge. (Iyov 37:16) In any event, the building of a whole world is revealed in prayer, whether in the one fixed, ordered and equal for all, or in that individual cry which issues from the depths of the heart of each individual and community according to their needs and situation. Together with all of the worldly traits, higher and lower; with all the practical and social, intellectual and artistic aspects through which humanity gradually perfects itself, arriving in a rectified fashion to a sweet and expansive life, the world orders in its exterior and, in known ways, even in its inner state - there comes at the head of all that internal order, the chief cause of all desires: prayer, which adds power and intensity into all the myriad branches of life, to all cultural stratagems and their enhancements, and one will know clearly how to apportion prayer and action, and their inter-inclusion one in the other. “For My House will be called a house of prayer for all peoples.” (Isaiah 56:7)
Prayer deepens within us the highest holy feeling, which is the essence absorbed of the light of the Life-giver<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This name of G–d is closely associated in prayer with the conclusion of Pesukei d’Zimra, the songs of praise which precede the declaration of unity found through the shema. As Rav Daniel days “Through Pesukei d’Zimra we have come a little closer to understanding the unity of the individual elements of creation. By calling God ‘Unique One, Life-Giver of the worlds’ at the conclusion of Pesukei d’Zimra and then declaring Him the One ‘who makes light and creates darkness’ at the beginning of the blessings of shema, we are transitioning to a consciousness of the unity of all and of the One who is its root.” <br>Here is a parallel text from R’ Kook which sheds light on his usage of this name of G–d.<br>התשובה העליונה באה מהברקה של הטוב הכללי, של הטוב האלהי השורה בעולמות כולם, אור חי העולמים. נשמת כל האצילית מצטירת לפנינו בהודה וקדושתה, כמה שהלב יכול לספוג ; והלא באמת הכל הוא טוב וישר כל כך, והיושר והטוב שבנו הלא הוא בא מהתאמתנו אל הכל, ואיך אפשר להיות קרוע מן הכל, פרור משונה, מופרד כאבק דק שכלא נחשב. ומתוך הכרה זו, שהיא הכרה אלהית באמת, באה תשובה בחיי הפרט ובחיי הכלל. <br>(אורות התשובה סוף פרק ב(<br>The highest form of repentance comes as a flash from the all-encompassing good, the Divine goodness which dwells in all the world, the light of the Life Giver of the Worlds. The emanated and noble neshama of all is depicted before us in all its majesty and sanctity, to the extent that the heart can absorb. In truth, is everything not absolutely good and right? And are the rectitude and goodness within not the result of harmonizing ourselves with all? How is it possible to be torn from this wholeness, an estranged fragment, separated off like an insignificant mote of dust? From this awareness, which is true Divine awareness, comes repentance in the life of the individual and the all.

Huna, says: Whoever has a fixed (kavuah) place for his prayer has the God of Avraham as his help. And when he dies, people will say of him: Where is the pious man, where is the humble man, one of the disciples of Avraham avinu! — How do we know that Avraham Avinu had a fixed place for his prayer? For it is written: And Avraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood. And ‘standing’ means nothing other than prayer.

A Guide to Prayer and its Elements

Before prayer, one must feel its necessity and its pleasure. Prayer does not desire to change a single thing within Divinity, which is the source of eternality and not within the bounds of change, but rather to rise up with all of the changes that beset the soul, and the entire world to the extent that the soul is bound up with it, to the Divine exaltedness. She speaks of Divine matters, which she longs toward according to her measure with great freedom, and in this freedom her light and truth are revealed to her. She speaks to G–d as to a ruling King liable to alter, as to a Father ready to change, as to a righteous and generous G–d whose righteousness and generosity are increased through arousal by another spirit; for when she longs to rise up to the Divine - behold in her will<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">See note 17 on will, as well as the discussion of will in the coming section in the body of the text.</i> she is already elevated, and her will is the entire essence of her being.
<i>R. Simlai expounded: One should always order the praises of the Holy One, blessed be He, and only afterwards pray. From where do we learn this? From Moshe; as it is written ”And I pleaded with the Lord at that time…” and it continues, “O Lord God, you have begun to show your servant your greatness and your strong hand; for what god is there in heaven and earth who can do according to your works and according to your mighty acts…” and afterwards is written, “Let me go over, I pray, and see the good land... </i>(Devarim 3:23-25)” [Berachot 32a]<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">It is noteworthy that the gemara choses to learn this lesson from Moshe’s prayer in V’etchanan, where it is made clear once and for all that his desire to enter the land will remain unfulfilled. Why learn from Moshe’s ‘failed prayer’ and not his ‘successful ones’ like his intervention on behalf of Am Yisrael after the Golden Calf and Miriam after her slander? This question is what drives Rav Kook to insist that Moshe’s prayer was not premised on the notion that G–d would change. The coming sections are going to rework our understanding of the traditional three part structure which underlies prayer – praise, request, and thanksgiving. In this and the following section, R’ Kook is teaching us that the purpose of praise is not to “butter up the boss” before we make our request, but rather to disabuse us of the notion that G–d’s will can change by exposing us to His absolute grandeur. For his re-understanding of request see section 2:5. For a re-working of thanksgiving see Olat Reiyah, Modeh Ani 1.</i> <br>Prayer must be clean of any notion of altering will<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">If we relate to the world as an expression of G–d’s will in a simple sense, then there is a fundamental problem with prayer as request. If G–d is perfect and therefor His will immutable, then what is the point of prayer? Not only is it arrogant to think I know better than G–d, it is futile to try and change Him. And yet we see that when Avraham Avinu was confronted with the immanent destruction of Sedom, he turns to G–d and says “Far be it from You to do such a thing…shall the Judge of all the earth not do justice?!” (Bereshit 18:25) Not only that, it seems from the verses which introduce the interaction between Avraham and G–d, that G–d expected such a response from Avraham. Avraham was not just arguing with G–d (the first instance we have of such a stance in the Torah and perhaps the reason that G–d felt the need to tell him of Sedom’s doom in the first place) he was saying – G–d, I know you better than that. You don’t want the innocent to die with the wicked. He is demanding not that his own will be done, but rather that G–d’s deepest will be manifest in creation. This is one way of understanding the requests we make of G–d – I know You don’t want sick mothers, or hungry children, or war, or exile, so please manifest your true will. This posture in prayer rejects the notion that the world as it is represents the full manifestation of G–d’s will and demands that He display His deeper will. Thus Rav Kook can say that we simultaneously ask for change while knowing that G–d does not change. As he says, we change and the world changes with us. We feel the lack in the world and allow it to change us through our desire that it be made whole. And when we lift up all the changes in ourselves and the world to Him, we become a channel for the manifestation of His higher will. And then the world changes.</i> or affecting response in G–d’s decree, a false conception in relation to Divinity which brings about the destruction of the ways of human perfection<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Perfection (שלמות) does not exist in this world of process, except in so far as one is always in the process of perfecting oneself ((השתלמות. This appears to be the aspect of G–dly perfection which this world expresses. See the gemara Bereachot 64a with the Maharsha</i>. In contrast, the actual value of prayer and the surety of its impact, within the realm of its terms, even aside from the attainment of that which is sought and the elevation and clarification of the soul through prayer, is a great cornerstone in the completion of humanity. Therefore, all who pray must understand that prayer is a wondrous statute<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The word חק is central to this piece. Traditionally the chukkim are understood as the laws given by G–d whose rationale lies beyond the comprehension of man, see Rambam, Hilchot Me’ilah 8:8 for a moving articulation of this definition. In biblical Hebrew it can also mean the fixed portion one receives from the one who sustains you (see Bereshit 47:22). In this piece it is important to see that Rav Kook is embracing the incomprehensible paradox of G–d’s grace in giving us the power of prayer, together with the impossibility of prayer changing anything within the Divine will. And that this is the lot we’ve been given from on high.</i> which the Holy One, blessed be He, engraved<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">חקק This can mean legislated, or engraved. There is an aspect of receiving law comes from adding a layer to existence, like ink on paper. This presumes that the person stays as they were and receives something new. There is another aspect of receiving which is a removal of part of the self – like the removal of stone in order to communicate meaning through engraving. One might think that the first is liberating and the second constraining, but see Pirke Avot 6:2 about the Tablets we received at Sinai.</i> in His world for the completion of His works in all manners of perfection, and in particular to accomplish of their moral completion which grows out of it. Prayer does not lie within the bounds of those things embedded in His decrees, G–d forbid (See Hilchot Teshuva 5:1-2) . It is therefore fitting that every prayer be preceded by the telling of praise, to teach that it is right to give great praise over the fixing of the statute of prayer not according to that which is understandable, so to speak, as the nature of His divinity<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The vision of prayer laid out in this piece fights against any mechanistic notion of action and reaction, but rather embraces the wondrous paradox of intimate relationship with the Infinite.</i>. And the proof from Moshe is very important. He, in his great understanding, would certainly never come to think that prayer could bring about any change in will or responsiveness in the decree of G–d. Nevertheless, his prayer was preceded by abundant praise, in order to reveal the truth of the proper consciousness fit to be impressed on the heart through prayer. All the more so we, ‘unsteady man,’ (See Tehillim 116:11) who might go astray after false ideas, should begin with that which elevates the soul and sets it on right conceptions.
<i>R. Eliezer says ‘one who makes his prayer fixed, his prayer is not supplication.’ What is meant by fixed? R. Yaakov bar Idi said that R. Oshiya said - all to whom prayer is like a burden. </i>(Berachot 29b)<br>Before prayer, the inner image<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The term ציור appears many times in R' Kook's writings on prayer. It denotes an inner image, a conception of either what is or what could be. There is a critical connection between our ability to conceive of something, and the challenges we face in actualizing that conception in the world. The ultimate inner conception which we can craft is our conception of G–d, which has the potential to transform us, after all if we are created in the image of G–d then how we conceive of G–d is also how we conceive of ourselves – see sections 3:7 and 4:12.<br>See Shmonah Kvatzim 1:585.</i> of one’s soul must be as if she is weakening beneath the burden of the gloom (See Yishayahu 50:3) of ideas, distant from notions of wholeness and the light of the face of the living King.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">See Mishle 16:15 for the source of this expression and Tomer Devorah perek sheni, midda shevii for some insight to its meaning.</i> Only through this will the load which lies heavy on her heart be rolled back– through pouring out her plaint before her Maker and her Father in Heaven. And through this she gathers courage, and in place of a dim spirit wraps herself in garments of joy (See Yishayahu 61:3) , and a new spirit in the power and delight of G–d will be her stance. (See Divre HaYamim I 16:27) But when this truthful conception is lacking and in place of the proper quality of prayer, which increases courage and renews strength in the soul and its feelings, it further exhausts - this is not the proper form of prayer, which must emerge from inner feeling and not from an imposed external obligation, which perforce is like a burden.<br><i>‘Rabbanan say – anyone who does not say it in a language of supplication.’</i>(ibid)<br>Even if one finds their heart stirred by the inner desire to pray, nevertheless so long as their intention is only to fulfill this inner feeling, this is not the foundation for prayer which is Divine service. Emotion is a proper means for placing the soul and ideas in a prayerful posture, but her (prayer’s) essence is above any emotive state of the human soul, because she is supplication before G–d, that His will be done. Therefore, it must be said in a language of entreaty, and through this shape as an inner image the truth that the feelings of the human heart have small value when compared to the lofty purpose of realizing G–d’s will in the world, which happens through prayer. <sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">“…but the prayer of the upright is His will” Mishle 15:8.

And on this R. Zeira said ‘I am able to introduce something new in it…”(ibid.) because the immensity of his feeling did not prevent his intellect from bearing its fruit according to the nature of the moment and day. However since, in the final analysis, intellect is not as natural as feeling, therefore he added ‘…but I am concerned, lest I become confused’ and I be drawn toward intellectual conceptions further than I can extend the inner feeling of the heart, and through this lose the quality of prayer.

A lack of inner awareness is included in the term <i>kevah</i>, because one’s prayer is not responsive to the changing feelings of man. The natural feeling by itself is called <i>kevah</i>, because it is fixed in the nature of the soul, unlike the service of the intellect which must be acquired through a path of chosen perfection. And the contraction of the intellect to the measure of the natural feeling is also called by the name of <i>kevah</i>, because it does not spread beyond the boundary of the natural quality of the soul, which is fixed and stable.
When we orient ourselves toward some particular objective in prayer, we must take to heart that our intention is to remove the darkness and evil from the whole world and to intensify the good and the light of G–dly life in its fullness; that life which in its advent not only fills a particular lack, but rather completes all deficiencies and restores all blemishes, and in the greatness of our souls we desire only absolute and complete wholeness.
Sometimes we pray that G–d fulfill our request via messengers, and sometimes we even specify the names of these angels. Because in truth it is fitting that the essence of what is sought in prayer be to join oneself to the will of <i>HaMakom, </i>blessed be He<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the Place, see the Mishna Berachot 5:1. “The word ‘place’ in this mishnah has a double meaning, or so it seems at first. On the one hand, it means simply the place where one stands. On the other hand, the Rabbis teach that G-d Himself is ‘the Place’, because He is the ultimate Place for the world and so it refers to Him (see Bereshit Raba 68:9) Hence in establishing place and aligning himself with it, Avraham was aligning himself with G-d, the Place. To appreciate how these to ‘places’ coalesce, and to appreciate the sense in which G-d is the place for the world, one needs to contemplate a bit about what ‘place’ is. Say you're sitting on a chair now. That's your place. But that chair is in a room, so in broader sense you place is the room. But that room is in your house, and that house in your town, and that town in your country, on your continent, in your world, in outer ‘space’. But that space too is in a place which holds it, enabling it to be. The irony is, though, that that place, the ultimate space, is no place at all. It is the space in which all things ‘are’ but it itself is not them. The truth is no ‘thing’ is truly space: anything which can be defined with dimensions and is distinguishable from some other thing is not the space holding it, but rather occupies a background, an essence, which enables all things to be. This contemplation to a most ironic conclusion: that which is ‘no thing’ is what holds all things and enables them to be. The truth is that this can only really be known as an experience, and the challenge for most people is that this experience only comes by letting go of ‘knowing’ anything and simply becoming ‘present’ to this awareness. This is because in order to ‘arrive’ at ‘place’ you need to let go of holding on to things and be alertly aware of... nothing! The truth is, the less you move, think or talk, the more you ‘stand still’, the more you are ‘there’ in the ‘space of all places’. If you allow this to happen, slowly and calmly following the contemplation above, you might notice that, inside of you, a certain quiet is developing. That quiet comes as thought is let go of and is actually the inner equivalent to ‘place’, the silence present when no words or thoughts, no mind objects, are there; when there is ‘only’ inner space. This silent presence of shehiýya is not only the way to align with place, it is the experience of it and its inner manifestation. Here you meet the unchanging, unconditional, essential Place which is ‘yours’, within you, an ever-present truth of essence. There you experientially meet He Who is, as the Rambam says, the only truth, the place of the world, from which ‘all that is manifest’ comes.” From Prayer Essay Three - Shehiyya: The Stillness Which Is Place, Rav Daniel Kohn</i> and not the attainment one’s desire.

And since we have merited the principle of prayer, that His will be done, which occurs through the outpouring of G–d’s loving kindness according to the extent to which the lower vessels have been prepared, then the very act of prayer is itself a tremendous preparation in the highest fashion for the outpouring of good and loving kindness through the revelation of the holy lights.
<i>“A tanna teaches like R. Yosi bar R. Chanina – Avraham established the morning prayer, as it says ‘Avraham rose early in the morning to the place where he had stood before G–d…’ </i>(Bereshit 19:27)<i> and there is no standing </i>(<i>amidah</i>)<i> other than prayer, as it says ‘ Pinchas stood up and prayed.’ </i>(Tehillim 106:30)<i> Yitzchak established the afternoon prayer, as it says ‘Yitzchak went out to converse </i>(<i>lasuach</i>)<i> in the field at evening time…’ </i>(Bereshit 24:63)<i> and there is no conversation </i>(<i>siach</i>)<i> other than prayer, as it says ‘A prayer of the afflicted, when he faints and pours out his complaint </i>(<i>sicho</i>)<i> before G–d.’ </i>(Tehillim 102:1)<i> Yaakov established the nighttime prayer, as it says ‘He encountered </i>(<i>va’yifgah</i>)<i> the place, and stayed the night there…’ </i>(Bereshit 28:11)<i> and there is no encounter other than prayer, as it says ‘Therefore pray you not for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, nor make intercession </i>(<i>tifgah</i>)<i> to me…’ </i>(Yermiyahu 7:16)<i>” [Berachot 26b]</i><br>These three expressions – standing, conversing and encounter, are aligned with three principle benefits that prayer brings to the service of G–d. The first act of prayer is to root firmly in the heart all the holy concepts and lofty images, the foundations of awe and morality which one has acquired in their soul, so that they will not falter under the storm winds which devastate morality and Divine service through desires of the heart and the passions of the time. The primary time for this rooting is the morning. That before one turn to the business of life and the inevitable feelings of bodily desire, they prepare a strong and well-founded moral posture for themselves which will standup under the oppositional trials of the waves of the times; therefore, the prayer which is oriented toward this activity is known as <i>amidah</i>, standing. To this end our father Avraham, first of the faithful, who withstood ten wondrous trials, and against all the multitude that opposed the path which rises in the light of G–d, who stormed in order to scatter and push him aside, was most fit; he fought to find a well-founded and enduring place to stand.<br>Prayer is called <i>sichah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">See gemara Avodah Zarah 7b where siach is the language associated with personal prayer</i> (conversation), sharing a name with the plants and trees which are called <i>sichim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">See Bereshit 2:5 which in this light could be read as “before there was any conversation.” This fits the nature of the second story of creation, which in its opening verse (Bereshit 2:4) uses the form of the word creation הבראם (in their being created) in contrast to the form ברא (created) in the first verse of the Torah. In general one can explore these two story as the first representing a subject/object relationship between G–d and creation and the second a subject/subject relationship. Hence the appearance of conversation at the outset of the second story. See footnote 2.</i>, due to the blossoming of the soul with new powers, which branch out naturally through the excitation of the soul in the service of the heart. This is most fit to the time of the evening offering, (see Tehillim 141:2) when one is close to casting off their troubles. Then their soul can elevate her nature, and the natural holy emotions stored up in her, to join to the living G–d and overflow with His pure love and awe, increasing fertile fruit and sending out shoots and branches, taking the likeness of a mighty tree<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">It is this aspect of prayer which ties the disparate pieces of creation together into a whole, a conversation. Note that the in the first story of creation there are individual plants (see Bereshit 1:11-12) but there is no field. It will take the type of prayer conversation which emerges in the second story, the siach hasadeh (see Rashi on Bereshit 2:5), to bind the blades of grass, the pieces of creation, into a whole that could be named a field. See Orach Chaim 61:3 and the Rama’s statement about how the gematria of two names of G–d, that which represents essence and that which represents expression, combine to equal 91, which is also the gematria of ilan, tree. The Maharal Be’er HaGolah, be’er chamishi says – know, that this world is similar to a single tree (ilan) which stretches from the root to the end of the tree, and it has many branches, drawn one after the other. So too it is with the world which is drawn from the First Cause that is the root, which is what we mean when we call heresy ‘to deny the root principle.’Its parts descend one after another until the final descent of the pieces of existence.</i> - one of the <i>sichim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">One of the pieces of creation, or ‘in the conversation.’</i> This natural blossoming from within the rightness of the soul is the root of the judgment which is passed upon the one who turns aside from the straight path of life. The attribute of judgment, in so far that it has a natural law, is exacting with one who changes its ways and strays from its path; and this is the attribute of Yitzchak, as it is written “Were it not that the G–d of my father, the G–d of Avraham and the Fear of Yitzchak, had been with me…” (Bereshit 31:42), as our Sages taught with thorough explanation.<br>However, there is another great advantage to prayer, that she find her essential purpose in those of the highest level and value, the highest holy ones who draw near to G–d, who rise up in prayer and lift themselves to the level of prophecy, or near to it, as is written in <i>Tur/Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim</i> 98; they encounter states well beyond the ways of nature, because they are lifted up far beyond the natural condition and cleave to the living G–d in purity of heart and soul. And the night is best suited for this, in its respite and solitude, as the <i>chasid </i>explained in The Duties of the Heart<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">R Bachya ibn Pakudah wrote Duties of the Heart in Arabic in 1040 under the title "Al Hidayah ila Faraid al-Ḳulub" (Guide to the Duties of the Heart), it was translated into Hebrew by Judah ibn Tibbon under the title "Ḥobot ha-Lebabot. R’ Bachya was a court judge and philosopher in Saragossa Spain. This work is the first systematic presentation of Jewish ethics and drew heavily from contemporary Arab thinkers. It presents ethics and philosophical understandings as the duties of ‘the heart’ in opposition to those of ‘the limbs’ which are the outward observance of the Law</i> (Gate of Love of G–d, ch. 6) on the advantage of nighttime prayer, which also facilitates visitation of sacred lofty visions and awesome intellectual fruits, that cannot be apprehended in the company of the physical senses. Things grasped from beyond the conceptual processes embedded in nature come not according to the natural gradual order of simple to profound, or through individual analytic pathways gathered together into a framework. Rather the great light of the sweetness of G–d is revealed suddenly, happy is the one who merits to it! Prayer is called encounter (<i>pgiya</i>), as when one happens upon something, as a result not only of the nature of the path which the traveler takes but also of the immanent nearness of the one encountered. And so it was for our father Yaakov, peace be upon him, for it is a certainty that his prayer prepared him for the lofty prophetic vision of the ladder and all its particulars (see Bereshit 28:10-17) , and that is why the name encounter is associated with his prayer, “and he encountered the place.” This is befitting the nighttime prayer.
<i>R. Chelbo said in the name of Rav Huna, ‘one should always take care with the afternoon prayer because Eliyahu was only answered through the afternoon prayer, as it says “And it came to pass at the time of the afternoon offering that Eliyahu the prophet drew near and said…answer me, Lord, answer me…” </i>(Melachim I 18:36-37)<i> R. Yochanan said, ‘so too the nighttime prayer, as it says “Let my prayer be set before You as incense; and the lifting up of my hands like the evening offering.” </i>(Tehillim 141:2)<i> Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak said ‘so too the morning prayer, as it says “Lord, in the morning hear my voice; in the morning I will direct my prayer to You and wait expectantly.”’ </i>(Tehillim 5:4) [Berachot 6b]<br>There are limbs which are doubled, whose redundancy is for enhanced safety, that if one should be lost the remaining one will fill its place. There are limbs each of which have their own intrinsic value, and if one is lost another cannot fill its place. Each of the three prayers fixed in their times is aligned with a particular aspect of the service of prayer, in such a manner that it cannot be considered a redundant limb, that at the very least one proper prayer will rise up from amongst the three; rather each one requires particular care in itself. One stands as a foundation against the overflowing of the inclination of one’s heart with the dissolution and foolishness that are mingled into the business of the world. This prayer restores one’s spiritual loss through pouring out the heart’s conversation before G–d, cleansing it of its false veneer (See Yechezkiel 13:10 as well as 22:28) with loftiness of pure conceptions of G–d consciousness and Divine service. The afternoon prayer acts toward this end. It comes after the intensity of the mundane concerns of the day, just as Eliyahu was answered then in his battle against the worship of the <i>ba’al</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Ba’al, which in Hebrew means master, was the foundational male deity with which Israel was in conflict in the biblical period. See Kings I 18 for the story of Eliyahu’s final showdown with the priests of the Baal. And check out theageofprophecy.com</i> The nighttime prayer lifts the human spirit into the glorious station of its soul, through the purification of thoughts and musings. “Let my prayer be set before You as incense…,” because the incense offering is a ‘thing done in secret’ (Yoma 44a) bringing about the fixing of one’s ways in their innermost chambers. (See Yechezkiel 8:12) It atones for evil speech said in private (Zevachim 88b) which occurs primarily through the thoughts of the heart (See Bereshit 6:5) , as it is written ”let one not devise evil in his heart against his neighbor…” (Zechariah 18:17) But in the morning, when evil influences have not yet clung to the powers of the soul, but they nevertheless lack a wholeness of potency due to the ascendency of physical nature during the night’s sleep, the morning prayer awakens and orders them in a framework of holiness, in a lofty accounting of righteousness and rectitude, in the awe of G–d and His love. “HaShem, in the morning hear my voice, in the morning I direct (e’eroch) my prayer to you,” the framework (ma’arechet) of my heart and the powers of my soul, “and I wait expectantly” that you will be with me to sustain my valor, because one who comes to purify himself receives assistance. (Shabbat 104a)

Prayer and Torah

Prayer serves to bring all the Torah, all service, all wisdom and the entirety of manifest life<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">For an exploration of this concept see Maharal Tifferet Yisrael perek 13, and 59,  Midrash Tehillim 50. And Shmonah Kvatzim 3:339 from R’ Kook.</i> into a natural quality and well-founded state of soul. Prayer is the life of the moment, that is to say - she gives life to the moment by placing it in line to draw down the abundance of everlasting life. But the Torah is everlasting life, above nature itself. When natural processes run right, then miracle<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The word נס can mean a flag or a miracle (see Rashi on Bamidbar 17:15), and the two are linked. A flag is raised in the midst of battle, or as a sign of sovereignty, in order to have a symbol above the plane of struggle. When people lift up their eyes to that symbol on high, it adds meaning to their plane of existence and struggle by adding a dimension to it, literally lifting up a flat worldview. In the same way, miracles reveal that there is another order of existence, of expressed Divine will, which exists. The splitting of the Red Sea will stand forever as an emblem of what is actually possible in the world, despite the evidence of our daily existence.</i> is a great and lofty level indeed, but when nature itself degenerates, then miracles are an imposition on heaven and a deficiency in that they change the orders of creation, “how lowly is this man…” (Shabbat 53b)<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">For more on the relationship between nature and miracle see Michtav M’Eliyahu p.177 HaNes v’HaTeva. Also the Rambam Yesode HaTorah 8:1</i>. We pray in order to set nature right, that eternal life be well-founded with us, aligned with the life of the moment which appears continually within us. “Let all that has breath praise the Lord,” (Tehillim 150:6) a distinct praise for every individual breath. The momentary and the eternal double over together, becoming a delight. “I will delight myself in your statutes – and I will speak of your statutes continually“.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 119:18/117. This is the joy of each instantaneous moment being perfectly aligned to express the infinity of creation.</i>
Prayer is from below to above. How so? From that very spring in our hearts, filled with natural holiness, behold we draw - actualizing its delicate feelings, aligned to elevate and exalt them, to purify and sanctify them in the holiness of transcendent purity which includes all sanctities and purities, all wisdoms and ways of knowing, all understandings and thoughts. Behold we are rising, and as much as our intellect grows, as much as our traits are clarified, as much as the manner of Divine cleaving<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Compare Shmonah Kvatzim 2:26 with section 4:13</i> is made stronger in life, in idea and will, in makeup and nature, in outcome and in aspect - so shine the lights that are revealed in us through our prayerful expressions. The further we descend into the depths of this lofty and august<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">In the sense of awe-inspiring. See Tehillim 89:8</i> matter, into the chasm of the innerness of our soul and all its greatness and power, we can gauge with more exacting measure our elevation through the process of prayer. And when we rise, all the roots of our existence rise with us, all the branches of our <i>neshama,</i> all the lines of life which pour out from our essence and all the sources of life which are poured out upon us, until they bring us to our particular essentiality. Everything is blessed<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The fundamental meaning of the word bracha, blessing, is addition. In turning to the Holy One with the words ‘Blessed are You…’ it is a declaration that He is the source of all abundance, who allows creation to be something separate from Him with an independent, creative stance. The midrash tells the story that the letters presented themselves before the Creator, each asking that the world be created through it. The letter ‘bet’ was chosen because it begins the word bracha and therefore the Torah begins with the word bereshit- in the beginning. In truth these two words actually share two letters – ‘bet’ and ‘resh’ which together make the word bar, meaning ‘son’ or ‘outside.’ These words are a call to an independent existence, to be a son capable of shaping and creating, an offspring who experiences himself as other than Primary Existence. Among all the works of creation, only man has the power of choice and the therefore the ability to shape his own life. Only humanity develops ideas, invents and forges new paths which lead beyond the givens of nature. Adam is the creature who realizes the Divine intention in the most real way. In this light, all humanity can hear the command to Avram to ‘go’ as an encouragement to move, to be themselves, and thereby to drive creation forward. In the journey of the siddur to say the words ‘Blessed are You…’ to the Creator is to open a channel to the river of abundance which pours down upon us and says – grow! The experience of being blessed with life, the knowledge of the precious nature of my existence, does not contradict the experience of God’s good which is poured down upon me and continues to flow within me as an expression of His will that I develop my unique selfhood. R’ Daniel Kohn<br>For definitions of the meaning of ‘beracha’ see Sefer HaChinuch Mitzva 430, Mishne Torah Laws of Berachot 1:3, Chizkuni on Bereshit 24:27, Rashba Responsa I 423 at the end, Nefesh HaChaim Gate 2 ch. 2</i>, everything rises, and everything is sanctified and uplifted, rejoicing the joy of the upright, exulting in holy elation. The nature of holiness itself rises up and is clarified, achieving a recognizable character, an active intellectual character which is no longer reactive - free and in command, ruling over all the expanses of life. This is the way<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">See Kohelet 8:5-6 for this usage of משפט</i> of prayer<br>In Torah we are occupied with the integration of life from above to below; from the lofty heights of the Divine intellect, from the source stone of which the Torah was cut, we take the portions of life and draw them down in their mighty greatness which fills all that is, which is greater than any end or limitation, and we root them in the depth of our naturalness, and our holy nature at the foundation of its strength overflows with the blessing of heaven through the outpouring of light which comes to us.
<i>Rabba saw Rav Hamnuna praying at length, he said ‘do we disregard eternal life and occupy ourselves with the life of the moment?!’ He thought that the time for Torah was unto itself and the time for prayer unto itself. [Shabbat 10a]</i><br>The Torah continually gives one intellectual comprehensions, which flow anew in every moment, and everlasting truths from the true source, which is eternal life. Prayer is not involved with making known new conceptions and enriching the intellect with their truth, but rather in using a portion of what is known and established to deepen, through the potency of feeling, the impression moral concepts make on the powers of the soul.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, prayer is taking the time to let ourselves feel what it feels like to know what we know. You know that G–d loves you, but how does that feel? You know that redemption will come someday, how does that feel?</i> This is why the Sages permitted descriptions of the Holy One in prayer – because they are a fit aid in feeling the impression of those truths which are already clear and revealed, and the soul’s feeling is best stirred by these descriptions. In that humanity is a physical creature, sometimes an image which is unrefined in and of itself is precisely what awakens them. In truth, from the side of its spiritual nature, breadth of consciousness is sufficient for the intellect - it does not need these efforts to deepen the soul’s impression through emotion. Nonetheless, in practice it requires this assistance due the burden of the body upon the flight of the mind. Therefore, the content of prayer is not the enduring, established truths which are from the side of eternal life, but rather comprehensions connected to embodied experience, which are the life of the moment; and it is not right<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">see Ezekiel 18:29. Seems the only usages are in Ezekiel, mostly in chapter 18</i> to abandon eternal life for the life of the moment.<br>In all involvement with Torah it is an established principle that one should always learn that which their heart desires (see Avodah Zarah 19a) , because then their inner spiritual inclination will lead them on the straight path. If their inclination is drawn to a particular portion in Torah, it is a sign that this part is most fit as a spiritual aid, attuned to the state of their soul. So too in the relationship between Torah and prayer. Intellectual judgment is not so qualified to set boundaries between how much one seeks their spiritual sustenance in the depths of the Torah and the fruits of the intellect, and how much from the seasoning of emotion; also in this matter the inner inclination will guide that which is right within one along the straight path. When the state of one’s soul inclines toward the allure of work in Torah – this is the time for Torah, which is the primary root in the completion of humanity, the individual and the entire collective. And when one feels themselves from time to time moved with desire for the yearnings required for expansive prayer and spilling out the soul before G–d, the measure of feeling is a sign that according to their soul state, this aspect is more necessary than any other form of completion, though that other may be higher in degree. The time of Torah to itself, and the time of prayer to itself. But the general times established for prayer were fixed according to the measure of the collective, because at these times it is fitting to be inclined toward prayer.
<i>“Rebbe Yermiyah was sitting before Rebbe Zeira and they were involved in their learning. The time for prayer was passing, and Rebbe Yermiyah hurried to get up. Rebbe Zeira called upon him, ‘One who turns away his ear from hearing Torah, his prayer too is an abomination.’ </i>(Mishle 28:9)” [Shabbat 10a]<br>One turns, from the very nature of their soul, toward the holy emotions for which, in order to complete them and bring their potential from the depths their soul, they require prayer. However, one could make a fundamental mistake in this matter. Because just as one has spiritual inclinations, which are from the side of the soul’s discerning<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">see Mishle 19:14. This is a one word description of the woman who guides the growth of the house described in the ‘woman of valor’ paean which closes out Mishle in 31:10-31</i> nature, so too one has a multitude of feelings for various appetites and physical desires. And this every person discerns – that in regard to the expansion of the tempestuous feelings in the heart toward physical matters and all that is related to them, there is nothing better than to guide them through the judgment of a Torah consciousness, which gives righteousness in all its paths and guides one on the good and straight way.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">see Devarim 6:18, especially the Ramban’s definition of what this mitzvah is found on that verse</i> If the soul is abandoned to its physical aspirations and all that is dependent on them, without the admonition of the Torah, it will surely fall - walking the way of annihilation and death. But in regard to the soul’s spiritual aspirations, whose entirety is love of G–d, delight in His goodness and the splendor of His glory, and in regard to the multitude of offshoots which branch from the depths of these feelings, one could think that there is no need at all to level for them a path of instruction; but rather that they can leave their soul to pursue her path and she will rise up in the love of the Eternal Rock (See Yehayahu 26:4) , yearn, long, sing (See Tehillim 51:16) out from the walls of the heart and pour out plaint, as much as her spirit, which rises ever upwards, lifts her. If so, one might think that there is no need of the Torah’s guidance for these spiritual feelings, which are the offshoots of prayer, and therefor when the time comes to pray one will hurry to abandon Torah learning in order to ready the offering of prayer. Not so, taught us the wisest of all men. Because in truth not only the physical aims of humanity, in which we are likened to an animal, require the Torah’s boundaries for restraint and order, but also our higher spiritual aspirations, which are among the foundation of prayer and its branches, require the bounding and ordering of Torah. Therefore, one who turns away their ear from Torah, not only will the multitude of their physical feelings turn to abomination, lacking a guide to conduct them on the path of life and light, but so too their prayer. Though it turns upward, nevertheless without the Godly discerning guidance to delimit it, it can become an obstacle and a distortion, and will not bear the good, desirable fruit. Their prayer is also an abomination.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">The term abomination, is obviously very strong and it is a bit of a mystery why the gemara would choose such language to characterize prayer, even when it comes without the guidance (or even at the expense) of Torah. One answer may be found in the discussion of the term between R’ Yehudah HaNasi and Bar Kapparah found in the gem. Nedarim 51a “You are straying through it [to’e ata bah].” In this sense, R’ Kook’s point about the critical role the Torah’s guidance is meant to play in giving form to our spiritual yearnings can be illustrated as follows. Imagine that you discover an all-powerful genie, who offers you one wish. In that moment you stand before a world of infinite potential, and incredible danger. You had better hope that you have total clarity on the truth of your inner desire, because if you do not and you wish for something other than what you truly want, you will live in the consequences for the rest of your life. In the same way, before we stand before the Master of the world and ask for our heart’s desire, involvement in the depths of Torah offers us to chance to clarify exactly what that is.</i> Therefore, it is not fitting that one rush to abandon involvement with Torah in the face of prayer, in order to engrave on one’s heart that also the higher side which is within them, the side of the holy, lofty feeling of which prayer is an outgrowth, must draw its measures and boundaries from the wellsprings of the Torah, to know all of its reality and to set it straight on the path of the good life which leads upwards for the wise (see Mishle 15:24) .
<i>“Their Torah is their craft.” </i>[Shabbat 11a]<br>Craft is founded in wisdom: “to think thoughts, to work in silver and gold…” (Shmot 31:4) but it requires for its perfection also practice - an intellectual construct of the understanding of art is insufficient for one to give concrete reality to artistic conception. However, it is possible that one could be so whole in the perfection of their conceptions, and their practical abilities so readily influenced by these conceptions, that they reach the level of “learning a skill by seeing it” (Shabbat 103a) ; that through their intellectual conceptions, they achieve immediate perfection of the practical manifestations born of them as well. And behold, Torah must lead to action, and the foundation of good action and of Divine service is to realize in act and in life the highest, holiest images of Divine righteousness and rectitude. Emotive prayer is the vessel most fit for bringing into concrete action our highest moral inclinations because it actualizes feeling, which is closer to action than disembodied thought. Through the power of prayer, the heart is softened and one is prepared to do the deeds of righteousness which are learned from it (the heart) through Torah study. Through its guidance one becomes a craftsman of righteousness, as in “the craft of a man in this world is to make himself as a mute.”<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">The gemara clarifies that this is true in all things other than speaking the words of righteousness which are the Torah (see Tehillim 58:2 on which this gemarrah is based)</i> (Chullin 89a) But so great was the spiritual influence of the Torah upon Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his companions (Shabbat 11b), and they were so readily moved toward all that is good and lofty by their learning, that they no longer required prayer as a means of elevating their feelings. Their Torah in itself was sufficient to impress their spiritual conceptions deep upon their tools of action, in the sense of “learning a skill by seeing it,” through seeing alone, in the wondrous manner of those who excel in artistic ability, such as Betzalel<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">See Shemot 31:2-5. Betzalel is the quintessential artist in the Torah, but on a deeper level he is the ultimate expression of the Image of G–d carried by humanity as expressed through being a creator. Not only is he able to give form to G–d’s plan for the mishkan (Tabernacle), but in the rabbinic mind the mishkan is a microcosm which reflects the blueprint of creation itself. That is why they see it as the source for the 39 types of work forbidden on Shabbat, the day we rest from our role as creators in the world and recognize G–d as Creator. Thus his ability is a shadow of the Divine creativity and his art a shadow of Divine creation. Hence Betzalel is read by the Sages as b’tzel El in the shadow of G–d.</i>, who through the Divine spirit which filled him was already able to actualize all practical craft, and had no need for learning by trial; therefore they in their occupation with the Torah were exempt from prayer, because their Torah was sufficient to be their craft as well.
<i>“R. Chanin said in the name of R. Chanina: If one prays at length, their prayer does not return empty. From where do we know this? From Moshe our Teacher, as it says, ‘And I prayed to G–d…’</i>(Devarim 9:26)<i>, and it is written afterwards, ‘and G–d listened to me that time also.’ </i>(Devarim 10:10)<i> Is that so? Didn’t R. Chiyya bar Abba say in the name of R. Yochanan - if one prays at length and expects the fulfillment of his prayer, in the end he comes to heartbreak, as it says, ‘Hope deferred makes the heart sick’? </i>(Mishle 13:12)<i> What is his remedy? Occupy himself with Torah, as it says, ‘But desire fulfilled is a tree of life; </i>(<i>ibid.</i>)<i> and the tree of life is none other than the Torah, as it says, ‘She is a tree of life to those who hold fast to her!’ </i>(Mishle 3:18)<i> — There is no contradiction: one refers to a man who prays at length and expects the fulfillment of his prayer, the other to one who prays at length without expecting the fulfillment of his prayer.” </i>[Berachot 32b]<br>Prayer is the product of spiritual feeling from the depths of the soul’s nature, and the intellect is fit to serve only as her introduction and foundation, because in so far as one’s intellect is lucid, and through it one’s actions aligned toward the essence of wholeness, so the nature of their soul is elevated and her power increased in the moment when she pours out her plaint before her Maker. But mingling a deep accounting of intellectual influences into prayer itself removes one from the realm of prayer at all, because the true nature of prayer, and its essential precious quality, comes not through an accounting of logical, intellectual connections, but rather from above this. That is how the nature of the soul is established - through the revelation of the essential nature of the depths of the pure soul as she turns longingly toward the G–d of her redemption. Therefore, to the extent that no alien force is mingled in the element of spiritual feeling, and she is left in her pure nature to aspire toward the object of her actions, the greater the power of prayer grows. One who prolongs prayer with the expectation of response, bringing intellectual functions into prayer, comes to heartache. The ways of the soul’s sentiments in her inner nature will be withheld from them, since they desire to give them intellectual pathways, through which they will never achieve comprehension nor come by way of them to their ultimate purpose.<br>However, if one’s soul longs for intellectual perfection, that through it their emotions be clear and more fit for intellectual awareness, the practice of prayer is not for this purpose. Rather, this is achieved through Torah, and the more one gains wisdom in Torah, and through it their intellect is refined, so the intellect will work on the powers of feeling and imagination, that they be their brightest. But there is one who prays at length in order to actualize the longings of the soul and its thirst for Divine intimacy, and does not expect to see their fulfillment. This includes the one who readies further wisdom and fitting holy consciousness before the time of prayer, because according to the magnitude of preparation, so will be the preciousness loftiness of the feeling. Their prayer is like the lengthy prayer of Moshe our Teacher, which flowed from the intellectual nature of that which preceded it, his primary occupation of Torah, and was a lofty preparation for prayer fit to the value of his stature. Such a prayer does not return empty.
<i>“R’ Elazar said ‘from the day that the Holy Temple was destroyed the gates of prayer were locked. And though the gates of prayer were locked the gates of tears were not locked. “Keep not silent at my tears.” </i>(Tehillim 39:13) ’” [ibid.]<br>Despite one’s intellectual perfection, they will never be complete if this perfection is not accompanied by the wholeness of their power of imagination<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">See Moreh Nevuchim Part II, ch. 36 “A man who satisfies these conditions, whilst his fully developed imagination is in action, influenced by the Active Intellect according to his mental training,--such a person will undoubtedly perceive nothing but things very extraordinary and divine, and see nothing but God and His angels. His knowledge will only include that which is real knowledge, and his thought will only he directed to such general principles as would tend to improve the social relations between man and man”</i>, in order that their conceptions and imaginative powers be founded on the deepest rectitude, which comes through delineation<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">See Mesillat Yesharim ch. 11 sect. 10 on the boundaries beyond which lie bad traits</i> by the intellect and wisdom. The Holy Temple is called the beauty of the world (See Shmuel I 19) and a house of prayer for all peoples. True beauty is the perfection of imagined conception through intellectual delineation, from which the highest moral guidance is drawn into the world - the essence of prayer is built upon this. Truly, so long as the abode of the all-embracing center, of the parity between the intellect and the imagined conception which is universally human, existed in the world, it was easy for individuals to lay the pathways of their conceptions according to the foundations of the intellect. And when, through this the imaginative power was elevated, it was readied to pour out great goodness into practical life. But from the day the Holy Temple was destroyed, and the all-embracing center, where the principles of the human soul found within the imaginative faculty could connect to the light of the intellect, was nullified - the gates of prayer were locked. Because it is extremely difficult for an individual on their own to elevate their power of imagination to the heights of the intellect; and sometimes in its overflowing, the imagination will stray from the path of the intellect and through excitement leave the line of the upright. In reality, this is only true when one’s seeking to conceive images of the good comes through a chosen act of imagination – then a general guiding force is needed, which we lack (due to our sins) from the day that the honor was taken from the House of our Life. It is the house of life from the side of the imaginative faculty, which is the axis upon which the life of man turns in its desires and inclinations. But true revelation is the revelation of the pure, G–dly intellect, “there is no honor other than Torah.” (see Pirkei Avot 6:3) However, it can happen that one’s conceptions will overcome him for the good, not by choice or through volition but as an outgrowth of all the pathways of the good intellect which are fixed in him, through which he continually strives to guide his soul. And when the powers in the soul come to this state, to a central point, fierce feeling beyond his normal power is aroused, and the tears pour out from the abundance of his longing for the good and the transcendent loving kindness “my soul thirsts for G–d, for the living G–d.” (Tehillim 42:3) In such a state of overflow of the products of the power of consciousness and its conceptions, G–d made man straight (See Kohelet 7:29) , that the innocence of his soul would always guide him in the straight path, and therefore the gates of tears were not locked. Through the wholeness that prayer such as this brings about, with the anchoring of one’s total state in consciousness and awe of G–d, the realization of the request is revealed according to prayer’s measure and worth, “keep not silent at my tears.” (Tehillim 39:13)

Paths of Action in Prayer

<b>Paths of Action in Prayer, for the Individual and the Community</b><br><i>And R’ Elazar said that prayer is greater than the offerings, as it says “To what purpose is the multitude of your offerings to Me…” </i>(Isaiah 1:11)<i> and it is written “And when you spread out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you...” </i>(Isaiah 1:15) [Berachot 32b]<br>One overcomes their evil inclinations, in order to walk the good and straight path which G–d seeks from us, in two manners. The first is an internal conquest of the powers of evil within, through an inner preparation along the way of good in the light of G–d. The second is through an outer vanquishing of the external causes which exist in the world and are apt to negate happiness and wholeness. Prayer, which is the inward service of the heart, magnifies the good of the inner powers themselves. The offerings increase the strength of the inner powers over the interfering forces which reside outside the body and soul, the animal forces of the external world. Therefore, prayer is greater than the offerings, as the inward vanquishing of the forces of evil within is superior to the defeat of external barriers, because the true value of a person is measured by the ascendance of the good which is intrinsic to them. The superiority of prayer over the offerings is also shown through this – that even when prayer is not done properly, nevertheless it has some sort of benefit. Therefore, it is said of offerings “To what purpose is the multitude of your offerings?” There is no benefit to overcoming stumbling blocks that lie outside oneself if one does not within themselves desire the good path. This is because external events remain as they were, only that one defeats them through their free will, and the service of G–d will be a help to them, amplifying the force of their soul for good. But if one chooses to turn toward evil, there is no benefit found in actions devoted to overcoming external reality. Regarding prayer it does not say “to what purpose?” because the moment of prayer, when the inner power of good overcomes the power of evil, is a good thing in and of itself - even if it does not impact the paths of life. It is only that, lacking the true benefit of righting the paths of life, such prayer cannot bring the boon of achieving that which is requested. But this does not mean that it is devoid of any benefit at all. Even though it is taught, “One who turns away his ear from hearing Torah, his prayer too is an abomination,”<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">See Mishle 28:9, Shabbat 10a and section 2:4 for R’ Kook’s discussion of this statement by the Sages</i> this is because prayer softens the heart and draws one’s desire toward that which appears to be good and right in the eyes of G–d. And by holding back from hearing Torah, one could come to think that good is evil and evil good, and their prayer becomes an abomination because it itself could cause them damage. Nevertheless, the inner clarification gained through prayer is beneficial and important in and of itself, even when one has not yet permanently fixed their actions on the path of good, nonetheless a single moment<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">see Pirke Avot 4:17, and also the Rambam Perush Mishnayot on Makkot 3:16</i> is laudable.
<i>R’ Chama bar Chanina said ‘if one sees that he has prayed and not been answered, go back and pray again, as it says “Hope in G–d, strengthen yourself and take heart! and hope in G–d…” </i>(Tehillim 27:14) [ibid.]<br>Unlike the end purpose of prayer and the achievement of what is sought through it, which is singular, the magnification of the soul’s powers and the actualization of her wholeness through conceptions of holiness and perfection happens through pathways many and broad, branching into a multitude of particulars without end. And all secrets are revealed before the Eternal Rock (See Yishayahu 26:4) , even which particular spiritual conception is fit to, but lacking from, each soul for its completion. So too the lack whose appearance necessitates the particular prayer<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">G–d ‘longs to hear the prayer of the righteous’ (Yebamot 64a)</i> which, through the order of His transcendent wisdom, parallels that which the soul requires for completion.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">The radical assertion which R’ Kook is making here is - we generally imagine that we pray because things happen to us, but from the Divine perspective things happen to us in order that we pray. The events which move us to pray are those which can evoke the particular prayers that bring about our completion. As a practice of introspection, we should all notice what things in life and the world move us to pray.</i> Sometimes the acceptance of prayer is delayed because the necessary spiritual conception is not completed in all its depth and variations within the soul until it has been repeated and reiterated many times. Therefore, one who has not been answered should go back and pray, and not say all is lost, G–d forbid. For is His hand shortened at all (See Yishayahu 50:2) that it cannot redeem?! Rather in His transcendent wisdom He considers how to give an end and hope<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">See Jeremiah 29:11, where the context is not despairing of exile.

This is the nature of humanity - when we make efforts and do not achieve our aim, we loses heart. But when one knows that every act draws them nearer to their goal, even if the lofty nature of that goal necessitates many steps, their heart takes courage and redoubles its labor - therefore it is said “hope in G–d…” Hope itself is the quality of wholeness<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">V’yesod hatikva hi ma’alat hashleimut…and the yesod of tikvah, the foundation of hope is…what is the foundation of hope, what is it grounded in, what is it founded upon? Ma’alat hashleimut…it’s grounded in the exquisiteness of the wholeness that derives from all the activities that preceded the wholeness that needed to come about. That’s what the hope is built upon, and I know I’m on the way and what I’m doing is not wasting and the things I’m involved in are bringing me to my will as long as I continue to deeply deeply pray about it. That foundation of hanhagat tachlict peulat hatfillah…of that being the end point of the activity of prayer…teidah ne’emana…then you’ll know…ki b’chal tziur shel tikvat hashem nekrav yoteir el hamatarah…then you’ll know that every description, every imagining of the hope you have for G-d, you have gotten closer.” R’ Daniel Kohn</i>, and the foundation of hope is that level of wholeness which is worthy to emerge from the quality of the actions which precede it. In accordance with the stature of this foundation, of the guidance offered by the end purpose of prayer, you will surely know that with each conception of hope in G–d you draw closer to the goal; only, you have not yet arrived because you have not yet reached completion. Therefore - strengthen yourself and take heart! And hope in G–d.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">It’s a very important question. The question is, is there some activity that would be appropriate to help maintain this perspective? In this instance I really believe it’s about being present, but being present and prayerful. It’s not just about being in the now. It’s not. It’s about being in the now in a mode of prayer, which is to say it’s about being right here with what is and being very attentive to it and yes, having a future in mind toward which this is leading even though you don’t know how, and yet a gratitude very deeply for everything that has brought you to this place. But being very attentive and aware of what is is crucial because if you let yourself float away from what is and just be in the hopes then what is just looks totally sour and off…but if you’re attentive to what is, so it becomes very deep in terms of how much what is really is what needs to be right there. R’ Daniel Kohn</i>
<i>The Sages taught – It happened once with a student that prayed before the ark in the presence of R. Eliezer, and he prayed too long. His students said to him, ‘how longwinded he is! He said to them ‘Is he more longwinded than Moshe our Teacher, of whom it is written “The forty days and the forty nights…” </i>(Devarim 9:25)<i>?’ It happened again that a student prayed before the ark in R. Eliezer’s presence, and he cut his prayer too short. His students said to him, ‘how brief he is!’ He said to them ‘is he more brief than Moshe our Teacher, of whom it is written “…please G–d, please heal her.” </i>(Bamidbar 12:13)?’ [Berachot 34a]<br>The value of prayer reveals itself through two things. The first is through the elevation of comprehensions and qualities, be they of the one praying or the one prayed for. For this great lengthiness is required, like the process of changing ingrained motions, which happens gradually. Such was the lengthiness of Moshe our Teacher - forty days, aligned with the days of formation of the fetus<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">See Berachot 60a.

And the second - that once everything needed for elevation has been done within the innerness of the soul, expressed prayer serves to actualize what has already been done within. For this, no duration whatsoever is required, because with one word a multitude of feelings are brought to light.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Compare this line to section 1:4</i> Brevity in prayer serves in the place which requires actualization of that which is already prepared.

<i>And R’ Yaakov said in the name of R’ Chisda ‘anyone who requests mercy</i><sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word for mercy or compassion is רחמים, rachamim, which shares a root with the word רחם, womb, and in rabbinic literature the act of praying is often called בעי רחמי, asking for compassion. The link between womb and compassion is that true compassion is a making of space for other to become, the posture of holding them where they are in order that they have the strength and support to become what they need to be. The womb is the ultimate making space for other to come to be.</i><i> for their fellow does not need to mention their name.’ </i>[Berachot 34a]<br>The impact of everyone’s prayer on themselves is determined by the extent of the moral improvement it affects, through which they become better prepared to receive their request. And the need which arouses one to pray is always calibrated by the highest wisdom to actualize precisely that particular feeling which one needs in order to prepare<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">The word הטבה used as preparation is central to the elements of service done in the Temple, and in particular in the holy and the holy of holies. It can relate to the fine grinding of the spices, which was accompanied by someone appointed to repeat the phrase הדק היטב, grind well, over and over as it was ground. See Rashi and Tosefot on gem. Keritot 6b:8-21. It can also refer to the preparation of the lamps of the menorah in the Temple, which is called הטבת הנירות. Then it is a process of making something completely ready to serve its purpose.

But prayer for one’s fellow is measured according to the extent of the relationship of the one praying to the one prayed for, and even more - according to the extent of the lofty and actual nearness of the seed of Israel one for the other. Therefore, it is not relevant to mention the name of the one who needs mercy, because the effect of prayer is not due to the stature of the one who requires mercy but rather to that of the one who prays, whom the one who needs mercy finds relating to them. It is due as well to the moral value found in praying for another, which combines with the benefit of prayer itself, that it be complete in its conditions which perfect the consciousness of the true G–d and His service.
<i>They said of R’ Chanina ben Dosa that he would pray for the sick, and would say ‘this one will live and this one will die.’ They said to him ‘how do you know?’ He said to them - if my prayer is fluent in my mouth I know that it is accepted and if not, I know that it is torn up</i><sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi on this Mishna says in one explanation that this is about the sick man not the prayer (Rashi 34b:12 in Sefaria)</i><i>.’…From where do we learn this? R’ Hiyya bar Abba said in the name of R’ Yehoshua ben Levi in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, as the Scripture says “I will create new expressions of the lips</i><sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi on Nechemiah 6:7 connecting this verse to the prophets. The whole discussion in the Talmud from the mishna to the end of the chapter casts important light on the relationship between prayer and prophecy. Also note that the first usages of the word prophet and the verb to pray appear simultaneously in Bereshit 20:7</i><i>: peace, peace both for far and near says the Lord.” </i>(Isaiah 57:19) [Berachot 34b]<br>The relationship between a person and their fellow reveals itself through speech, and the acceptance of one’s prayer for their friend is certainly due to the truth of the relationship which exists between them. Therefore, the extent of its acceptance is also revealed in the form of the speech through which it is expressed. And at the right hour, according to the extent of the relationship found between the one who requests and the one for whom they plead, this acceptance reveals itself in actuality “the expressions of the lips.” This is because true peace is the joining together of people in relationship, to act and be acted upon in a good way.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Recall that ‘good’ can be used in a sense which is not moral, but rather essential. In this sense a good deed becomes an action which moves creation toward the complete expression of the Creator’s initial intention for creation. In which case this phrase would mean ‘to act and be acted upon in a way which brings them toward the wholeness which was the Divine intention of their creation.’ See footnote 11.</i> The ‘expression of the lips’ works ‘peace, peace for far and near,’ creating relationship and connection even between people who are far from one another, and bringing about the acceptance of our prayers for one another. Our prayers are tested through the paths of speech as well, because even after all the preparation, and the ability, and further preparation complete expression requires the help of G–d. “The thoughts of the heart are man’s, but the utterance of the tongue comes from G–d.” (Mishle 16:1) “I will create new expressions of the lips…”
<i>Another story of R’ Chanina ben Dosa, who went to learn Torah with R’ Yochanan ben Zakkai. The son of R’ Yochanan fell ill and R’ Yochanan said to him ‘Chanina my son, plead mercy for him that he may live.’ He put his head between his knees and requested mercy for him and he lived. R’ Yochanan ben Zakkai said ‘even if ben Zakkai threw his head been his knees all day long they would not pay him heed.’ His wife said to him ‘and is Chanina greater than you?’ He said to her ‘no, rather he is like a servant before the king and I am like a minister before the king.’ [ibid.]</i><br>There is an intellectual path of service which guides one on the ways of G–d, and there is a way of service which depends more on the good emotion. Both are combined in a good heart: the good and true intellect which in its truth guides all the powers of the soul, and the good emotion which rules over all the inclinations of man. In truth, for one who locates their source (Compare Tehillim 87:7) in intellectual service the pure conception which they achieve is primary, and prayer does not significantly enhance their perfection along his path. But for the one who chooses the path of feeling, prayer and its acceptance assist in uplifting the state of their service. Therefore, it is more readily accepted, because the eye of G–d (See Tehillim 33:18) is on the those who stand in awe of Him to perfect them through the path they walk (See gemara Makkot 10b) . Therefore, though in and of itself the service of the intellect is higher than the service of emotion, just as the intellect itself is a more elevated power than feeling, nevertheless the effect of prayer is seen by the one who locates their source in the purification of emotion, who elevates their spirit through the pouring out of expression and feelings of natural inclinations to cleave to HaShem, the living G–d. They are like a servant before the king. Their stature is lowly relative to one who places their source in true conceptions gained through the intellect from the source of the holy Torah in all its might, elevating through its loftiness even the status of emotion – they are like a minister before the king. But lowliness of stature draws near the realization of the desire for which one prays.
<i>“I am the woman who stood by you here…” </i>(Shmuel I 1:26)<i> R’ Yehoshua ben Levi said ‘from here we learn that it is forbidden to sit within four cubits of one praying.’ </i>[Berachot 31b]<br>From the side of the foundation of prayer in the emotions of the heart, it is fit that on seeing one’s fellow moved by the feeling of the beauty (See Tehillim 90:17) of G–d, every upright person be moved as well. Even though one’s intellect does not act upon their fellow unless they themselves set their heart to understand, feeling is a natural force that effects anyone whose heart is right with G–d. It is proper that feeling act upon all who are near and see the Divine service of their friend. And since it is fit that this feeling act upon those close at hand, it is also correct that one not sit when within four cubits of prayer – because to do so is as if to show that the feeling of their friend’s Divine service does not act upon them, a stance not befitting to a heart faithful to G–d. Regarding the benefit which comes to prayer through strengthening the good emotion, this occurs because feelings are closer to actions and thus work more readily upon them than the intellect.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Most people are familiar with the intimate relationship between physical and emotional being. We have all chopped wood or gone for a walk to ‘blow off steam,’ and many people are familiar with somatic practices that allow healthy access to emotion through physical pathways. There is a path in the work of Torah which sees the embodied soul of the nefesh as the seat for the emotive soul of the ruach, which in turn can serve as a resting place for the intellect soul of the neshama. Ask we bring each level into right alignment, the next comes to rest upon it in a fashion which is more whole and clear. There are disciplines which understand the entire structure of the prayer book, and in particular of the morning service, as a gradual process of awakening and preparing each layer of the soul to receive that which lies above it. The physical work of the offerings, serves as preparation for awakening the heart through the songs of praise. The engaged body and awake heart then allow for an intellectual consciousness which can declare the unity of G–d with clarity. Properly prepared, the Amidah offers access to Chaya, that portion of the soul which is receiving the boundless life-force that pours in from source and enlivens our individuality. And when we fall on our faces in supplication after the silent Amidah, it is in hopes of touching the place of unification, yechida, our point of contact with source of existence itself.</i> Therefore, a standing posture is appropriate - a stance ready for action.

All-embracing <i>kavana</i>, which is alignment with heaven, is the benefit that arises from its wholeness, which in its encompassing nature is already present in the very ideas which are the substance of particular <i>kavana</i>. From the perspective of particular <i>kavana</i> , the ascent achieved through each particular prayer is not recognizable, though that prayer may stand at the apex of the world, and even add elevation. This is like the progress of bodily growth, unrecognizable in each of the particular steps of which it is comprised. Such is not true of the all-embracing <i>kavana</i>, within which lie everlasting mountains (Habakuk 3:6) of great and sacred comprehensions, offering an ascent highly sensible and easily recognized. As one’s recognition of the sublimity of the Master over all works grows, so increases the exaltedness of surrender. Therefore, when R’ Akiva prayed by himself his ascent found expression also through his bodily state. It was not possible for him to stand in one place, due to the bowing and prostration which revealed his increasing recognition of the transcendent loftiness. Despite the greatness of this level, it is only truly appropriate to intensify the power of all-embracing <i>kavana</i> when secluding oneself in the wholeness of prayer - when one is in community they should join their state to the level of the community. And, in that it was impossible for the greater community to align with the depth of the spiritual conceptions of a holy man of G–d such as R’ Akiva, he would fit his prayers to the standard of the particular <i>kavana</i>, on the lofty level of joining with the community, which adds to and determines the unique status of the individual.
<i>R’ Yehoshua says ‘one who is traveling in a dangerous place should offer a brief prayer and say ‘save, G–d, your people - the remnant Israel’. </i>(Yermiyahu 31:6) [Mishna Berachot 4:4]<br>Since for the complete acceptance of prayer, through the lofty status of joining one’s soul together with the community, it is fitting as much as possible to make one’s state equivalent to that of the community, when one is in a place of danger they should recall that all the remnant of Israel likewise need G–d’s salvation, because they too are in a place of danger, “one lamb among seventy wolves.” (See Tanchuma Toldot 5) And in the salvation of the whole, the individual is saved as well.
<i>Our Sages taught – one does not stand up to pray while immersed in sorrow, nor in laziness… [Berachot 31a]</i><br>Prayer must cause the powers of the soul to occupy themselves with pure insights and the powers of the body to occupy themselves with good deeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">By pushing both conception and action toward perfection, prayer becomes the primary tool for actualizing the good in the world which is “not yet.” See notes 2 and 11 above.</i> Therefore, one must align the powers of body and soul so they are fit and suitable to receive the wholeness of the impact of prayer. One must forestall sorrow, that it not weigh down the powers of the soul, preventing them from rising to comprehensions pure and clear; and laziness, that it not prevent the powers of the body from strengthening themselves for good deeds. Then one will be ready for the additional perfection aroused through prayer.<br><i>…and not while immersed in levity, nor in chatter, and not while immersed in frivolity, or in idle speech. [ibid.]</i><br>Wholeness in prayer must be preceded by four inner conceptions<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">See note 46 for a definition of this critical term.</i>. First is the awe of G–d, which is the opposite of levity. Levity diminishes awe, even awe for the honor of the one who is himself laughing, as the wise man said “one filled with levity diminishes respect for their honor.” Second, that the essential wholeness of the soul lies only in her inner happiness<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew language is word poor relative to other languages. Therefore, if one wants to communicate nuances of meaning they must access the referential usages of a word in the context of the wholeness of Hebrew literature rather than simply use synonyms. The word happiness is an interesting exception to this rule, with its many synonyms. It seems to me from the context of its first appearance in Leah’s naming of Asher in Bereshit 30:13 that osher is the particular happiness which derives from abundance. See R’ Shimshon Raphael Hirsch’s comment on Bereshit 30:13. As Rav Kook uses this particular term for happiness three times in this section, it bears reflection on the role played by the joy which derives from abundance as a preparation for prayer. Prayer is a posture of inner malchut, kingship, of embracing a conception of creation which flows from within - “this is the glory of royalty, for because of one’s joy that he is king, he lacks for nothing.” R’ Menachem Mendel from Kotks. Shem mi-shmuel, Sefer Bereshit, Vayera pp. 152, 156</i>, in her recognition of her glory and perfection when she delights in G–d and is illuminated by the light of consciousness and awe of G–d. Therefore, since the inner happiness of the soul comes through meditation with herself, at the time of prayer one should distance any situation which attests to wholeness acquired from outside of the soul. And this is the basis of all conversation – to find happiness with others and not within oneself. Third, that actions must be founded on a complete conception of the awesomeness of G–d. Therefore one must hold back from frivolity, because the basis of frivolity is behavior that is in opposition to one’s own insights. Fourth, one must conceive the precious value of speech. Through this the value of prayer will be impressed on their soul, by valuing the power of that which makes humanity exceptional<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">See Onkelos on Bereshit 2:7, and Rashi 2:7. See also Sefer Kuzari 1:35 which defines the essence of the human being as the speaking creation</i>. Therefore, distance yourself from idle words that teach one to disparage the value of speech, which is fit to be honored and cherished.
<i>…rather while immersed in the joy of mitzvah. [ibid.]</i><br>A <i>mitzva</i> comes to realization also outside of the soul of the one who performs it. In truth, joy is the sensation of inner wholeness which the upright soul feels in the rightness of her path and its goodness. And, in that prayer is the choice fruit of time (see Kuzari 3:5) and its purpose inner soul perfection<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">For more on the notion that the purpose of prayer is inner perfection, see sections 1:4 and 4:4</i>, it is fitting that it reveal itself through the pleasure of a whole inner life, through the joy of <i>mitzvah</i>.<br><i>Our Sages teach – one who prays must direct his heart toward heaven. Abba Shaul says a sign for this is “You will prepare </i>(tachin)<i> their heart, You will cause your ear to hear.” </i>(Tehillim 10:17) [ibid.]<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">The whole verse is “You shall hear the desire of the humble, O LORD, You will prepare their heart, You will incline Your ear.” The Hebrew word תכין means to set on a sound basis for what comes and shares the root כון with the word , kavana כוונה. See the Radak on Psalms 10:17 who says that here, in relation to prayer, it means to remove all distractions of the world which trouble the heart. Compare this to the Rambam’s comment on the Mishna Berachot 5:1 "The first chassidim would wait an hour (shohin) [until thoughts ceased-Rambam] before prayer, in order to align (lchavein) their hearts with Place." Rav Daniel adds - Shehiyya is sitting in stillness in order to align your heart with the Place. The one who sits in stillness learns that in truth he carries this place within him. It is the very life which he has, and the revelation that things are so clears the way for standing before the Shechina.</i> <br>There is particular <i>kavana</i><sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Compare this section to section 4:8</i>, which is alignment with the meaning of the words and ideas of prayer. There is all-inclusive <i>kavana,</i> which is an alignment of the heart with the greatness of G–d and the soul’s elevation suitable to her illumination by the light of G–d, for which the hour of prayer is uniquely favorable. This is what we learn here, that aside from aligning with the words and ideas in their particularity, one must direct align their heart with heaven and the loftiness of G–d to the extent that their soul can bear. And through this remembering<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">The link between kavana and memory flows from a reading of ‘to remember’ as to “re-member.” Since memory is always located in the present, every act of remembering is a summoning up of past events, experience, states of consciousness and attaching them to my present awareness. The subject of memory is nominally the past, but it is a past accessible only through the lens of present identity. We do not remember everything, and what we do remember is most often not a factual “first-person account” of the past but rather a blend of our experience of it then and now. Just recall an important event with a sibling, parent or old friend and compare accounts. Or think of an event which occurred more than 5 years ago in your life which you said ‘nothing will be the same after this.’ Now ask yourself if you understand that even now more or less than when it happened. In this sense, memory becomes a process of telling a story of the past which fits into present identity, which provides it with a sound basis. But the present passes in an instant. Unless we engage in regular consciousness practices like meditation, mindfulness and reflective prayer then we may find it extremely difficult to be present to the present. Most of our identity exists in a tension between memory and aspiration/anxiety for the future - the story of what was and the story of what will be. Therefore the whole picture of memory is the telling of a story of the past that shapes present identity which is oriented toward the future of which we dream. Or dread. This is why R’ Kook says that through the remembering of G–d “the soul is lifted up to the wholeness of prayer’s purpose” which is what aids its acceptance. We are praying for the future, for something toward which we aspire, and the question which lies behind so many of the thoughts in this introduction is – am I the person I need to be in order to receive the things I desire? Memory of G–d is a deliberate connecting of present consciousness to a heart’s conception of His awesome greatness and the openness of soul which allows me to receive His light. And when my present self is wholly aligned to that feeling, idea, experience – I become, if only for a moment, the one to whom G–d would grant such a request. And if we pray often, with deep enough alignment, we can reorient ourselves and the world around us to the future for which we pray.<br>The Holy Ba’al Shem Tov teaches that memory is the secret of redemption <br>בעל שם טוב דברים פרשת עקב ח. ורם לבבך ושכחת את ה' אלהיך וגו'. אמרו בגמרא (סוטה ה' א) אזהרה לגסי הרוח דכתיב ורם לבבך ושכחת, והרב מוהר"ם מקוצי מנה זה במצוות לא תעשה, וכתב אשר נגלו אליו האלהים בחלום הלילה, שעיקר אזהרת כל התורה הוא מצות הזכירה, וההיפוך הריסות התורה חס ושלום הוא השכחה, וביאר הוא (רבינו הבעש"ט זי"ע) כי כאשר יש עכירות בדם אז האדם הוא בבחינת אחוריים גימטריא תשכח, כי הזכירה נמשך משמות זכר, והשכחה מאחוריים דאבא ואמא גימטריא תשכח כמו שכתוב ביחודים, וכמו שהוא בפרטות אדם אחד כך הוא בכללות, שנמשך הגלות מהשכחה, ומהזכירהיב) בא הגאולה, ודברי פי חכם חן: (בן פורת יוסף דף ע"ג ע"א, צפנת פענח דף צ"ו ע"ד)<br>Sefer Ba’al Shem Tov Devarim Parshat Ekev “…lest your heart grow haughty and you forget the LORD your God…” (Devarim 8:14) They said in the gemara (Sotah 5a) This is a warning to the proud in spirit, as it is written ‘lest your heart grow haughty and you forget.’ The Rav Moshe m’Kotzi counted this as a negative commandment and wrote that God revealed to him in a dream, that the essential warning of all the Torah is the commandment to remember and that forgetting, which is its opposite, God forbid destroys the whole Torah. And the Holy Ba’al Shem Tov explained - when the blood is clouded, then one is in the aspect of the ‘back end’ which has the numeric value of ‘and you forget’ because memory flows from male names (?) and forgetting from the ‘back end’ of Aba and Ima which is the numeric value of ‘and you forget’ as is written in the Yichudim. As it is with an individual, so it is with humanity – exile flows from forgetting and redemption from remembering. “The words of a wise man’s mouth find favor…” (Kohelet 10:12)<br>See Shmonah Kvatzim 1:416 from R’ Kook on the relationship between memory, miracle, consciousness and redemption:</i> of G–d and His greatness, the soul is lifted up to the wholeness of prayer’s purpose, which of necessity aids its acceptance. And Abba Shaul said that this is what ‘prepare their hearts’ means - that through remembering G–d, their hearts are prepared for justice (see Yishayahu 45:19) and rectitude. Like the words of Rabbenu Yonah<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Sha’are Teshuva (Sha’ar 2, siman 1, sha’ar 3, siman 27)</i> on the verse “It is through the Lord that all the offspring of Israel have vindication and glory.” (Yishayahu 45:25) There he says that through recalling G–d, the seed of Israel becomes righteous and praiseworthy, because through this recollection their soul is lifted up to every good trait, to every practical capability and heart’s wisdom. And so G–d is the One Who prepares their hearts, because their hearts are lifted up to great things through the remembering of Him and His might. And through this ‘You will cause Your ear to hear.’ This teaches that aside from the particular <i>kavana,</i> that is absolutely primary, the all-inclusive <i>kavana </i>is certainly required. This type of <i>kavana </i>is indicated by ‘prepare (<i>tachin</i>) his heart to heaven,’ it aids the acceptance of prayer.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">אלשיך על תהלים י:יז והנה תאות ענוים שמעת ה', ומה שלא עניתם הוא מפני שעדיין רחוק לבם קצת ממך, והוא הנודע מרבותינו ז"ל (ספרי האזינו שו) כי שמיעה היא מרחוק, האזנה או הקשבה מקרוב, שעל כן אמר ישעיה (א ב) שמעו שמים והאזיני ארץ, לכן תכין לבם ואחר כך תקשיב מקרוב אזנך: <br>Alshich Psalms 10:17 You shall hear the desire of the humble The reason You have not answer until now is that their hearts were still somewhat distant from You. It is known from our Sages (Sifre Ha’azinu 306) that ‘hearing’ indicates from a distance, while ‘giving ear’ or ‘listening’ are from up close, as in “Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord has spoken…” (Isaiah 1:2) This is why it says ‘prepare their hearts,’ because only after this will Your ears hear from up close.</i>
<i>Our Sages taught – a blind person and one who cannot orient to the directions, should direct his heart to his Father in heaven. [Berachot 30a]</i><br>The ultimate <i>kavana</i> is an alignment of heart to one’s Father in Heaven, to His nearness and His will. In truth, many and long are the paths that must serve as preparations, bringing us to fulfill the desire of our Father in heaven. And true fulfillment is when one aligns their heart with the end purpose, broadening through every great and manifold means their modes of consciousness and action. (Compare this to Rambam Hilchot Deot 3:2-3) Directing our prayer toward the Land of Israel and the Holy Temple teach this.<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Because they represent vessels of action and consciousness on a scale which can encompass the greatness of human capacity in its wholeness and not just its individuality.</i> In and of themselves the national feelings within <i>Am Yisrael</i> prepare the heart for Divine service, elevating the consciousness to a recognition of the value of the commandments, and moving one to do them out of love. But those who cannot grasp the whole process of completion, and when the way grows long stop in the middle, thinking that the nationalism which they perceive in Israel is the end goal of the entire holy spiritual vision (when it is actually only a guide that leads to the purpose, so long as it is safeguarded by all the great paths of life faithful to G–d’s Torah), must strive not to lose the primary purpose. They must direct their heart toward their Father in heaven, because through alignment with the point of ultimate purpose - all paths which lead to it will be aligned, through the loving kindness of G–d.
<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">See Shmonah Kvatzim 2:82</i>The impact of prayer is from her aspect of joining to G–d<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Joining or cleaving to G–d, dveikut, is a central concept in Chassidic teachings and has a strong presence in R’ Kook’s thought as well. See section 3:2 and footnote 65. In addition here is an exploration of the idea from the works of the Holy Aish Kodesh, the Piaseczno Rebbe.<br>Hachsharat Avreichim ch. 14 “And all you who clung to HaShem your G–d are all alive today…”(Devarim 4:4) The gemarrah explains the state of dveikut in Sanhedrin 64a - not ‘bound together’ which would mean not well attached, rather truly made as one. And in the holy book Toldot Yaakov Yosef he says in the name of the Rambam that the essential purpose of the entire Torah and the commandments is to arrive at the state of “…and cling to Him (u’bo tidbakun)” (Devarim 13:5) And now we can see that the path of service of chassidut is not an additional level of service which one could do without, rather it is the essence and purpose which one cannot do without. Because how is it possible to cling to G–d through the service of dveikut if one serves without the nefesh, has not revealed it and it is not in one’s hands?! Only through the service of chassidut which is done with one’s revealed nefesh, which is in one’s hand to reveal, can one cling to Him with a true cleaving – each according to their spiritual status. This is also the idea of self-sacrifice (mesirut nefesh – lit. handing over of the nefesh) in one’s service, as brought above in chapter 5 from words of the Bet Aharon, and is why it is called mesirat nefesh and not mesirat guf (handing over one’s body) because the meaning is not only self-sacrifice in a situation where one is faced with forced heresy (G–d forbid) and gives their body over to death, rather that all of their service every day of their life, all of it - one’s will, thoughts, character traits and body are given over to HaShem and His service. When one comes, G–d forbid, to their hour of trial then their obligation is to extinguish their body and life and hand them over to HaShem. And in their daily service, they should surely live, and never the less the should cling to HaShem with all their body, nefesh and strengths and little by little in all service, learning and prayer in every moment and every hour give over portions of their strengths, nefesh, ruach and neshama to HaShem unto the point that when they reach their final moment after lengthy days and years they find that they are entire given into His blessed hands. Therefore the intention to sacrifice ourselves which we are all obligated to have when we recite the shema is not a theoretical construct, that if such a trial should come upon us we would give ourselves over. But now when we are not being so tested, and the vast majority of times when most Jews are not being tested, that our thoughts of mesirat nefesh when reciting shema are fleeting and without substance, G–d forbid. Our Holy Master, the Ba’al Shem Tov, taught that where one’s thoughts are, there they are as well. Therefore when one imagines with powerful thought, and can almost see with their own eyes, the fire before them into which they are thrown, then it is considered as if this occurred in truth, since they are where there thought are – in the fire. I saw in one of the holy books a hint to this from the verse “…we are considered as sheep for the slaughter.” (Tehillim 44:23) We are considered, that is through our thoughts of self-sacrifice themselves we are as sheep for the slaughter, as if the slaughter actually happened.</i>. This joining makes the form similar to its Maker<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">See the source of this concept in Midrash Bereshit Rabbah 24:1</i>, absorbed into its transcendent power. And the special quality of joining to the Divine is that the very image with which this joining is conceived, effects its action in a more tangible manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">We are created in the image of G–d. Therefore our idea of the God whom we are modeled after, and the manner in which we imagine joining with God, shape our consciousness, expressions and actions. The self which emerges is then able to conceive of an even more perfect conception of God, and imagine a more intimate joinder, which in turn produces a higher image of the self. And so on…</i> Expressed prayer is the manifestation<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">The word הופעה can be translated as appearance or manifestation.

The reality of this joining is according to the measure of the developed knowledge of Godly matters, and the refinement of actions and traits which precede it. Then the all-embracing oneness is revealed, the spiritual mastery which increases right and proper lovingkindness shines forth in the abundance of its colors, “You shall decree a thing, and it shall be established for you; and the light shall shine upon your ways.” (Iyov 22:28)

Even the natural will for life, and for everything connected to the will of the vital soul, things required by every man and desired by many animals, receive a refined form in the clarified soul. The highest exaltation, which comes through the elevation of the will at the hands of Godly consciousness and Divine intimacy, which penetrates ideas, intellect and emotion, aspiration and desire, the stormy and the calm, lifts up all the sparks of will to the pinnacle of elevation to unite them with the all-embracing aspiration of absolute wholeness of the Divine light which pours into the world to give it existence and life. When, through revealing the desire of the ‘righteous who is an everlasting foundation,’<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">See Mishle 10:25, Yoma 38b</i> we arouse a will such as this, the will of one who lives their life in a luminous form lit by the light of the Life-giver of the world<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">See footnotes 20 and 40 for an explanatory texts on the Life-giver of the World</i> - requests are fulfilled and rule over all is magnified because of the Divine light which flashes in the pure will in the fullness of wisdom and loving kindness. When one such as this reveals their will through the soul-revelation of prayer<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">See section 1:1 for an articulation of this definition of prayer</i>, the light of the Life-giver of the world is revealed along the paths of their desire, which is itself revealed through outward expression and inner meditation in the intensity of life<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">It seems from many sources (one of which is found above in footnote 116) that R’ Kook believes once one uncovers their true will they have found a manifestation of the Divine will. See footnote 17 for a practice which can aid in uncovering this will. But if one succeeds the question remains – what if I discover that I disagree with G–d in my essence. I have heard this question from many of my queer students, and it seems to me that the only answer is to stand before G–d as you actually believe yourself to be, using prayer and His presence as a mirror to strip away all falsehood while insisting on unbroken relationship.</i>. Then the aim of the all-encompassing good, as it relates to that particular which is right now the sole objective of the who one pleads, is revealed from the innermost place of the <i>neshama</i>. For the great <i>neshama,</i> every small request is encompassed within the greatest of desires. Each individual suffering, every pain and sickness, all sorrow and distress borne by any soul, when impressed upon the illuminated soul which is filled with the Divine good, ceases to be a small, individual suffering, and becomes a world spanning, universal sadness. And the removal of this suffering brings an encompassing light (Iyov 3:4) to the horizon of life and existence. According to the greatness of the will for Divine good in the soul of the one praying, and the degree to which the light of wisdom and the Divine might is nested in the depths of their heart, so prayer hits its mark, and the revelation of desire effects its action. “Who confirms the words of his servant, and performs the counsel of his messengers…” (Isaiah 44:26)
<i>R’ Elazar said – prayer is greater than good deeds, because no one was greater in good deeds than Moshe our Teacher and nevertheless he was only answered through prayer, as it says “It is enough for you, speak no more to me of this matter…” </i>(Devarim 3:26) [Berachot 32b]<br>There are two aspects to the precious nature of the righteous soul: good deeds, which are the offspring of the righteous (See Rashi Bereshit 6:9. Also Yishayahu 3:10, with Kiddushin 40a) brought about through the soul’s activities, and the precious, lofty and treasured nature of the refined soul itself, crowned by the acquisition of good traits and true conceptions. And when such a soul orients itself in prayer toward a specific thing, the blessed G–d decreed (See Tehillim 148:6) that prayer succeed according to the extent of her value and merit. And R’ Elazar’s words teach that the treasured fineness of the great soul rises above the preciousness of its circumstantial good - the good actions which are as chance occurrences in comparison to the pure and clarified soul itself. But that which the weight of good actions could not effect, comes about through the value and merit of the preciousness of the holy soul in its own right. The proof is from Moshe our teacher, whom none surpassed in good deeds. All his good deeds were insufficient to nullify the decree against him, but prayer would have worked. G–d had to declare “speak no more to me,” (Dev. 3:26) implying that additional speech would have been more effective than actions. And this is why in the next line we find “Go up to the top of Pisgah…” (Dev. 3:27) Just as, if through additional prayer Moshe had attained all his request it would have surpassed the bounds set by the weight of his good actions, so too that portion of his request which was fulfilled was through the power of prayer - which comes from the essential treasured nature of the soul and its inner composition, elevated beyond its circumstantial expressions. This is because the revelation of the preciousness of the soul through her inner treasured nature, and not only through her circumstantial expressions, comes through refined prayer, which is called pouring out of the soul: “…and I have poured out my soul before G–d.” (Shmuel I 1:15)

Modeh Ani

<b>Modeh Ani.</b> The first appearance of the exuberance of life brings with it the transcendent joy of holy rejoicing, which finds the fullness of its glorious expression through thanksgiving. Gratitude, recognizing the goodness of the Lord of the world, Master over all works, who in His goodness gives life to the living, is the storehouse of good. It contains all the substance of a fulfilment of obligation, as well as that spiritual refinement which comes through the fullness of love produced through relationship, and the <i>neshama </i>is illuminated by it, filled with light and joy. The teaching that there is an obligation to give thanks through language, particularly through the expression ‘grateful acknowledgement’ (<i>modeh</i>), is derived from two aspects of meaning in this term. One is thankfulness, <i>todah</i>, which results from gratitude toward the one who does good; the other is confession, <i>hitvadut</i>, which is an acknowledgement of the truth. The two are fit to one another. The first exuberance of life which meets one as they rise from sleep, finding before them a full, new world in all its wholeness and goodness, lifts up the light of the inner intellect to recognize the light and brilliance which lie at the foundation of life. In place of the muddied, physical perspective which is impressed in the nature of flesh, the spirit rises to a clear Divine perspective, to see the soul of the light of the Life-giver of the world in the splendor of its action. And moved by his feelings of thanksgiving, man acknowledges the truth, fulfilling the depths of the truth of spiritual awareness, testifying on all the light of life and existence, that it flows from the spring of goodness and its source, from the source of transcendent lovingkindness, which pours out abundant life to all the many worlds and their creations. 
<b>I.</b> A man finds himself within himself, through the light of the Divine life which appears within him, that fills him with the good spirit of a feeling of gratitude, of a recognition of the Divine goodness and its expression. Because of what consideration is man worthy in the weakness of his power, in his small nothingness, when compared to the mighty greatness of existence and the awesome powers of creation which crown it. Standing before them, filled with emptiness, man loses the substance of his selfhood. But when the light of recognition of the Divine goodness shines on him, and all the holy offshoots, powerful in their holy might, which it awakens with him – then a man comes to awareness of the greatness of his worth, of his ‘I-ness’ and its non-disappearance into the wholeness of existence. Then he finds himself filled with joys to say wholeheartedly, I.

...The distinction between wisdom and knowledge. Wisdom is when one recognizes a thing, knows its value and is drawn to it with complete freedom of choice; knowledge comes once one has delved deeply into wisdom and is drawn after that which is infused with wisdom, cleaving to it with all their powers in addition to wisdom. When it comes to something wholly good, knowledge is a great and important level, crowning wisdom itself. As with the essence of all knowledge, knowing G–d. Through wisdom one recognizes His greatness and the glorious majesty of His kingship, but nevertheless they still stand outside. Even though a recognition of the truth means that one will not contradict the dictates of wisdom, and the fear of G–d will be their storehouse (comp. Is. 33:6), guarding their steps from the snares of transgression and sin, nevertheless the totality of their powers have not yet entered into the feeling which flows from wisdom. Through a depth of knowing and the pull of will, one acquires the quality of knowledge - then heart and flesh cry out for the living G–d, yearning to serve Him, eternally infatuated with His love. This is the dimension which knowledge adds to wisdom. But in light of this, we know that knowledge is only positive in relation to that which is itself good in all its aspects, having no potential for transgressing boundaries, something which the more one cleaves to it the greater their joy and success, never reaching the ultimate heights of its power. When it comes to something with negative aspects, while wisdom is fit for it (because after all it has some good, and wisdom knows to draw it out) nevertheless knowledge, which is how one’s powers connect to and are drawn after a thing, is extremely damaging because all one’s powers, even those which cannot distinguish between good and evil, will be drawn after the bad as well as the good, resulting in great harm. Even though, in truth, without knowledge there can be no full awareness, nevertheless one should not risk cleaving to evil for the sake of superior awareness. This was the snake’s seduction, that this awareness would come through the power of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, to which it was forbidden to cleave. Through eating its fruit, man’s will and all his powers were drawn after and clung to both the good and evil which were in it. In consequence, now in every case where it would have been appropriate to employ only wisdom, we use knowledge as well and harm flows from the evil within it. This is why the verse says “…to increase knowledge is to increase heartache.” (Kohelet 1:18) It does not say ‘to increase wisdom is to increase heartache,’ G–d forbid, because “…wisdom preserves the life of he who possesses it.” (Kohelet 7:12) It is only if one adds knowledge in a situation which requires wisdom that they increase heartache. Even though they add to their awareness of the thing in question, one who adds actually subtracts, as the wise said in regard to the tree of knowledge itself in gem. Sanhedrin 29a - man’s failure flowed from the principle of ‘anyone who adds, actually subtracts.
