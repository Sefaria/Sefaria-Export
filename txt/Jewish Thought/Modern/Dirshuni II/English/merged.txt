"Abraham returned to his servants, they arose, and walked together to Be'er Sheva..." (Gen. 22:19)  Where did Isaac go? He went to Be'er Lachai Ro'i, as it says "Isaac had just come back from the vicinity of Beer-lahai-roi, for he was settled in the region of the Negeb." (Gen.24:62)  Isaac went and fled fraught about his father, his mother, and his God.  How did it happen that he was bound, that they saw fit to do it, and why do it to him.  He went to the wilderness, to a place where no man passed or dwelled.  They said, "no man," but a woman did pass there, and it was Hagar - Be'er Lachai Ro'i (the well of life's shepherd) is Hagar's well.  Isaac stood at the well until he remembered Ishmael who had played with him when he was a baby.  He remembered Hagar who had walked away with a jug of water on her shoulder.  Isaac sat there with Hagar and Ishmael, cried with and shared anger with them for many days.  One day, he stood at the well opening and behold, the living God saw him, the living God heard his voice in the moment, and Isaac was comforted.  He arose, took Hagar, and brought her back to his father, as it says, "Abraham too another wife, and her name was Keturah." (Genesis 25:1) Keturah is Hagar whose cries rose like the smoke (ketoret) on the altar. He also arose and took Ishmael and returned him to his father, as it says, "His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him" (Gen. 25:9) "He shall reconcile parents with children and children with their parents" (Malachi 3:24). Afterwards, Isaac returned to that welland settled there, as it says "After the death of Abraham, God blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac settled near Beer-lahai-roi."(Genesis 25:11)  This is why it is said about him that he re-dug old wells and brought out of them living water.

Exodus

I

<b>Wise-hearted Women</b><br> Ayalah Ronen Samuels
And the Lord took us out from Egypt by a mighty hand, by an outstretched arm and awesome power, and by signs and portents. (Deuteronomy 26:8)
The Holy One, blessed be He, only took us out from Egypt in the merit of the wise-hearted women:<br>"By a mighty hand" - that is the daughter of Levi, who strengthened her hand to send her son into the water, as it is stated (Exodus 2:3), "so she got a wicker basket for him and caulked it with bitumen and pitch, and she put the child into it and placed it among the reeds by the bank of the Nile."<br>"By an outstretched arm" - as it is stated (Exodus 2:5), " She spied the basket among the reeds and sent out her arm to fetch it."<br>"And fearful power" - that is Shifrah and Puah, as it is stated (Exodus 1:17), "The midwives, fearing God, did not do as the king of Egypt had told them; they let the boys live."<br>"And by signs and portents" - that is Miriam, since all of the years that the Israelites wandered in the desert, a wonderous well that was given to them on her account rolled together with them until the day that she died and the well went away, as it is stated (Numbers 20:1-2), "and the people stayed at Kadesh. Miriam died there and was buried there. And the community was without water."
Hence it is stated (Exodus 35:26), "And all the women whose hearts inspired them with wisdom" - about those women whose hearts inspired them with wisdom and overcame the failing of strength and wherewithal, the fear of the monarchy and the limitations of man. And about such as these, it is stated (Song of Songs 3:5), "that you stir not up, nor awake my love, till it please." For with these actions, they stirred and awakened the lower ones and Supernal ones for redemption.
<small><b>Wise-hearted Women:</b> "And every wise-hearted woman with her hands" (Exodus 35:25). <b>And sent out her arm to fetch it:</b> According to one of the opinions, "her <i>amah</i>," is the daughter of Pharaoh's arm. See BT, Sotah 12b. <b>"And by signs and portents" - that is Miriam:</b> See Bamidbar Rabbah 1:2: What was written? "Miriam died there and was buried there." And what is written afterwards? "And the community was without water." And how was the well made? It was a boulder like a type of hive, and it would roll and go with them on the journeys. <b>That she died and the well went away:</b> Tosefta Sotah 11:1: The whole time that Miriam was alive, the well would suffice for the Israelites. From when she died, what does it say? "Miriam died there and was buried there. And the community was without water." For the well went away.  </small>

For whose benefit?
This is the matter that the Lord commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying: "They shall be wives to whomever they think best, according to their own preferences." (Numbers 36:6)
It is not stated as "in their eyes" but rather "in their own eyes," and why is that? Because the hands of the men established and wrote according to the perspective of the men. And despite all their wisdom and greatness, the matter was not of interest to them personally. However, the daughters of Zelophehad sought goodness, desired goodness, and did goodness as the Lord commanded. Therefore, it is fulfilled and written: "They shall be wives to whomever they think best" - "in their own eyes" specifically, because these women shall be considered good in the eyes of the people for generations.

Ruth Explained (Yael Unterman)
She left from the place that was there, and there were two daughters-in-law with her, and they went on their way to return to the land of Yehudah (Ruth 1:7). They lifted up their voices, and they cried, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, and Ruth clung to her (Ruth 1:14).  
They trod three milin (unit of measurement) until they reached the border of Moav. Naomi said: Go, return to the house of your mother (Ruth 1:8).
Orpah said: Mother-in-law, does not the Torah say, "Therefore a woman leaves her father and her mother and clings to her husband, and they become one flesh"? I don't have a husband, and I am thoroughly abandoned — how can I return? 
Naomi said: My daughter, I did not teach you thus, but rather it is written, "Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife, and they become one flesh" (Genesis 2:24) and the choice is in your hands.
Orpah kissed her mother-in-law (Ruth 1:14). She said, "It is the law, and I accept it." She returned to her mother's house. 
Ruth interpreted these things: "Ish" (the word for "man") includes "ishah" (the word for "woman"). Just as a man leaves his family and clings to his woman, so too does a woman leave her family and cling to her man. When "b'ishto" (to his woman) is said — it includes his father-in-law and his mother-in-law and the descendants of his family. Immediately (i.e. as soon as Ruth made this point, the narrator said) — "davkah bah" (she clung to her). 
Orpah, who did not know how to interpret [it], did not merit [Ruth's decision].
And Ruth, because she interpreted [correctly], she merited the crown of Torah and the covenant of the forefathers, and she became the mother of royalty.
Another interpretation: Ruth said to Naomi, "I don't have a father or a mother or a husband, except for you alone. And from now on, I am like a newborn baby." "Davkah bah" (she clung to her). The sages determined the halakhah (law) like this, that behold, a convert who converts is like a child who is just born, and every last body part that they had when they were an idolator, they don't have anymore.

Book of Esther

I


<i>The couriers went out posthaste on the royal mission, and the decree was proclaimed in the fortress of Shushan; the king and Haman sat down to feast, but the city of Shushan was perplexed.</i> (Esther 3:15)
And who knew the secret of that confusion? That was Mordekhai, as it is stated (Esther 4:1), "And Mordekhai knew all that had been done, etc." And what is this word, "all," here? It teaches that it was not only the outer layer that Mordekhai knew, that which is revealed and known to the eyes of all who see, but also what was inside. For there is one who gets excited and comes to the world dressed in only one cloak; such that it is only the one who enters his rooms who can see the tunic below it.
And why was it specifically Mordekhai who knew? Because it is said about him (Esther 2:5-6), "There was a Judean man in the fortress of Shushan, whose name was Mordekhai, son of Yair, son of Shimii, son of Kish, a Binyaminite man. Who was exiled from Jerusalem with the captives exiled with Yechaniah, king of Judah, driven into exile by Nevukhadnezzar, king of Babylon." Do not read it as, "Nevukhadnezzar," but rather as, "<i>nevukhah denetzar</i> (the perplexity in store)." And some said, "The confusion (<i>mevukhah</i>) in store." Come and see that from that which Mordekhai was exiled by Nevukhadnezzar, he understood that confusion of the fortress of Shushan - that Nevukhadnezzar stored away the confusion that he earmarked for the Jewish people and guarded it until it would be fully ripe. Until the day would come when it would bring gladness, as old wine gladdens the heart of man. Since the more it ages, the better it becomes, such that the expert will wait.
