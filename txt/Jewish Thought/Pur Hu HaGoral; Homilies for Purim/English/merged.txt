More than once, joy has been perceived as superficial in comparison to tragedy and melancholy: Connection to depth usually passes through the abysmal, and dwells in the desolation of the pining away of the soul. Yet it appears that the profundity of Jewish joy is found specifically in the abyss of the broken heart. However this is a broken heart that overpowers itself and does not allow itself to fall, that knows how to turn hopelessness into faith and sadness into ecstasy. Behold ecstasy is the opposite of hopelessness and it has no center without it [as its opposite]. The difference between Purim and other holidays is the difference between joy and ecstasy.
