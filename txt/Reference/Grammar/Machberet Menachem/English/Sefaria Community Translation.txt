Machberet Menachem

Introduction

With the help of the Creator, who gives speech to the lips, I will attempt to delve into the laws of language, to teach a language that is more refined than any chosen expression and the pinnacle of eloquent speech. This language, meticulously formed from the amalgamation of all languages that humanity inherited since the dispersion of the nations, each person with their own tongue.
At the beginning of the key of language and the outset of understanding, let us give honor and praise to the glorious and awe-inspiring God, who has adorned mankind with all His creations. He has shaped us in a wondrous form and bestowed upon us the breath of life, enabling us to articulate our tongues with the expression of words, to convey true knowledge with clarity. Just as He has distinguished us among all living beings by the superiority of our language, so too has He distinguished His chosen people from the nations of the world.
And just as the marvel of language amazes humanity, so does the Holy Language amaze in comparison to the languages of all peoples and nations. It molds man with its expression, revealing the power of his deeds and the greatness of his abilities and wonders. Indeed, within it, thoughts of man are shaped, and through it, words of excellence are spoken to ignite passion and govern with wisdom. It unravels secrets and acquires strategies, reveals evil intentions and exposes cunning plots, encompassing all aspects of the heart's conflicts and understanding minds.
So, even before any intellect in the inhabitants of the world chose this language, our God selected it and engraved it in the tablets of the Covenant. In them, He spoke on the day of the Revelation at Mount Sinai. It was at that moment that a small spark ignited within me, an intense desire to master the Hebrew language, its essence, and its fundamental roots. To establish measures, logic, and principles of learning in order to explain their solutions as the statute of judgment. To interpret the outcomes of their matters into various categories and to reveal the face of each word according to its expression. To teach the rooted and incorporated letters that serve within the word and its two ends, until the Hebrew language and the expanses of understanding are fully comprehended. However, it is upon the people of understanding to embrace discipline, to grasp the path of intellect, and to incline towards the abode of knowledge. They should know the nature of the letters and the intricacies of their history, to contemplate what belongs to the foundation and what belongs to the practical application. Yet, the letters of the Holy Language are twenty-two in number. I have assigned ten of them to the foundation and ten of them to serve, constructed upon twelve fundamental principles that transcend their history. Each level and stage has its own interpretation and significance, until reaching the pinnacle of human intellect, understanding their essence and true content.
Behold, this is the law of the letters concerning the divisions of their effects: I have assigned twelve of them as foundations, rooted and standing, with no other purpose than serving as foundations. These are: 'Tet-Chet-Samekh-Peh-Resh, Gimmel-Zayin-Tzadek'. Additionally, there are five levels for the letters derived from these foundational and rooted letters. When combined in words, they also serve within other contexts and initially appear as rooted and standing in their strength. However, in certain circumstances, they may emerge from the words. Know that any word composed of three letters from the rooted letters stands on its own strength and does not require the presence of any other letters, for it possesses sufficient power and completeness within itself. However, a word formed from two letters and united as one is fit to serve due to the brevity of its structure. For the short word alone does not stand, except in conjunction with suffixes attached to its beginning or end. Yet, in this language, there are a few short words that do not require suffixes for their service, as they possess sufficient power in their brevity. Additionally, there are twelve remaining letters designated for service, and they are divided into two categories: those serving as companions and those appointed to serve in other contexts while maintaining a firm grasp of their essence. In the column of arrows, the language is well suited for precise service, and these are the words: "Sh-m-l-a-kh-t-o B-y-n-a."
This is the wonder of language and the power of expression. Understand this, people of understanding: see and behold how twelve letters serve as a single word in the following phrases: "Erdah na" (Genesis 18:21), "Bir'dat hayaar" (Isaiah 32:19), "Hor'da adayikh" (Exodus 33:5), "Vehorad hamishkan" (Numbers 10:17), "Yarad yardeinu" (Genesis 43:20), "Kerdat Moshe" (Exodus 34:29), "Ler'det min hahar" (Exodus 32:1), "Merdat Shechat" (Job 33:24), "Nir'dah venishberah" (Genesis 43:4), "Sheyored al harrei Tzion" (Psalms 133:3), "Terad me'od" (1 Samuel 20:19). And this is how it happens with other words as well. Behold, we find that all twelve of these letters serve the purpose of descent. And after their service, they turn and become a foundation and rooted. But when they ascend from their position, they are rooted in different contexts, as it is written: "The Lord said" (Joshua 7:13), "God created" (Genesis 1:1), "Be strong" (Genesis 27:29), "And the pillars wept" (Exodus 27:10), "Beautiful in elevation" (Psalms 48:3), "He cut a covenant" (Exodus 34:10), "Learn to do good" (Isaiah 1:17), "The Lord has anointed me" (Isaiah 61:1), "Cry out loudly, O praise!" (Ezekiel 30:24), "Hear, my son" (Proverbs 1:8), "They have come to an end; they are cut off" (Joshua 3:10). Indeed, these are the letters that are prepared to serve and have become foundations, and there are many such examples in the Holy Language. However, the initial letters do not undergo such changes, for they are founded, grasped, and stand firm in their power. They do not change between the two categories, and they do not deviate from their nature, except through the movement of pronunciation and the fluctuation of language, according to the appropriate point of the word, in order to encompass the understanding and interpretation of every matter. These are the three higher degrees out of the twelve.
And these are the five letters that appear as rooted and standing firmly like foundations, but they ascend in certain circumstances. These are exclusively their outcomes and various manifestations.
The first attribute is when the letter "Tav" (ת) begins the word.
These are the endings of their words:
