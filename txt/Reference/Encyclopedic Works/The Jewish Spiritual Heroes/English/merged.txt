The Jewish Spiritual Heroes

Volume I; The Creators of the Mishna

Introduction

T<small>HE HISTORY OF A PEOPLE</small> is primarily constructed out of the biographies of those individuals whose activities characterize the specific nature of the progress and development of the national forces, both internal as well as external.
No prominent person can be entirely detached from his environment. It makes but little difference whether such a person influenced the environment in which he lived or whether his individuality was conditioned by it, for this type of influence is mutual and complementary. Just as the individual presents a picture of his environment in miniature, even so does an environment present a composite photograph of its component individual parts.
Every person develops in a different manner; neither does this development follow an unbroken path from beginning to end. Life, on the contrary, follows some very devious ways and the chronicler must find a suitable approach for each complex historical situation in order not to go astray.
“World history is the history of heroes,” is the claim of a German philosopher. This rule also applies to Jewish history with this difference that our heroes are generally “spiritual heroes,” master navigators of the deep and stormy literary sea and commanders on the battle fields of the Torah.
Especially heroic were the struggles of our spiritual heroes of the time when we lost our political independence and were becoming accustomed to the role of a wandering people which is forced to live in a foreign environment but insists on retaining its own mode of life.
World history is motivated by an eternal force which flows in an endless labyrinth of channels and is given form and direction by the leading spirits of each generation. It is therefore necessary, first of all, to observe the ways of the leading spirits rather than the events which transpire.
The historical development of a people contains no accidents. Every event has its cause and reason which are results of previous events. It is therefore important to bear in mind that a matter of fact relation of events is not as significant as the understanding of the spirit and the logical necessity of such an event. We must also remember that ever since we lost our homeland the spirit of our people has found its expression in ideas and theories.

Concerning the Talmud in the form that it was taught in Babylonia (and therefore called the Babylonian Talmud) as well as in the form in which it was expounded in Palestine (and therefore called the Jerusalem Talmud), is recognized as the exclusive creation of the Jewish spirit to which the Gentile world can lay no claim.
As far as the Bible is concerned we are confronted with various accusations. The enemies of Jewry find it undignified to admit that the Jews are the creators of the greatest spiritual treasure which the civilized world possesses. They therefore claim that the Bible is not specifically Jewish. The liberal legislation of the Pentateuch and the noble ideals of the prophets, they say, have been borrowed from neighboring peoples. When they do recognize the greatness of the Bible, they give equal credit to other peoples.
The style of the Bible is today the possession of all civilized peoples and has become a fructifying element in every language; but the Talmud could not be taken away from us and the honor of being the creators of this great work will remain with us forever.
Seven centuries passed from the time of Simon the Just, the last of the members of the “Great Synagogue” or “Great Assembly,” when the oral law became popular among the masses of the people until the conclusion of the Talmud. On the foundations of the Torah there was erected an imposing structure—an eternal monument to Jewish spirit as it developed in those seven centuries. This development began immediately after the conclusion of the Bible when the Jews lived on the soil of Palestine for the second time and even continued in Babylonia where they sought refuge and found freedom and happiness for many years. It lasted even in Babylonia until they had to flee the sword.
Seven centuries is a long time in the life of any nation, even in the life of such an old nation as the Jews are. For no matter how conservative our historical evaluation it would be impossible to assume that no changes occurred during seven centuries. As among other nations, so also among the Jews there appeared new ideas and new concepts during these centuries. In the course of the years these new ideas developed and spread, only to disappear later on and to be supplanted by others. This is especially true when we consider that we are dealing with a time when the political conditions of the nation changed radically. At times the Jews lived freely in their own land and at other times they were involved in wars, at times they were exiled from their own country and at other times they prospered in other lands.
It may also be stated with certainty that in all Jewish history there never was a period so involved and characterized by unusual events as were the seven centuries during which the Talmud was created. The sources of information concerning that period are very meager and every historian must fall back on his imagination in order to complete the picture that was handed down to us.
If one wants to establish the true facts concerning events which took place at that time from the information contained in Talmudic literature, he must bear in mind that these books were not written with the aim of presenting history. They were therefore not careful to present exact dates or precise information regarding the people of whom they wrote. Whenever history is dealt with, it is generally embellished with many legends and even the personalities of the heroes are not definite.
For our purpose the event which occurred may be of paramount importance but the authors stressed a personality; in other cases we may be interested in a personality while they stressed the event. It is also necessary to remember that the original text of the books regarding historic events and names of persons was not strictly adhered to. There therefore exist in the Talmud numerous versions pertaining to people and events. Thus we read a story regarding a certain Talmudic personality, but another version may vary by one word and change the sense of the event to have involved another person or to have occurred in a different manner.
Such variations could easily creep into the Talmudic books when the copyists made an error in transcribing a name or when they sought to shorten their work and employed abbreviations which can be interpreted in numerous ways. These errors are not so important in establishing a law. It makes but little difference if the name of the person who rendered the deciding opinion regarding a law was misspelled. But where we are concerned with establishing historical facts, such errors are very confusing.
The basis for the Talmud was provided by the “Sofrim.” These were the copyists of the Torah who were at the same time teachers explaining the sayings of the Torah to the people. The original text of many commandments was not very clear and could not be understood unless they were interpreted. But the interpretations of the Sofrim became accepted and on the foundation of their explanations there grew an organization of seers and elders which came to be called “The Men of the Great Synagogue.”
The Great Synagogue acted as a Supreme Court in deciding all religious matters and it was presided over by the High Priest. The beginning of the Great Synagogue occurred in the time of the last prophets (Haggai, Zacharias, Malachi) when the people, under the leadership of Ezra and Nehemia, signed a written covenant to observe the laws of Judaism, and it ended with Simon the Just.
At first it was prohibited to put the interpretations of the Sofrim in writing and they were handed on orally. Later it became obvious that they would be forgotten and so they began to write down all the traditional interpretations to the commandments of the Torah and they were considered as laws which God orally instructed Moses from Mount Sinai. But before this was done the Bible was completed in twenty-four books so that no one should try to add any of the traditional interpretations to its text.
Even today it is difficult to establish with certainty the time of the duration of the Great Synagogue. Of the history of the second Temple we lack the chronicles of the events of a period covering about 200 years (from the time of Alexander the Great till the reign of Antiochus). All we know is that it was a time of turbulent political changes and that control of Palestine changed hands several times. It is considered that these were the years of the Great Synagogue.
Ezra the Cohen and Scribe was the greatest scholar of the Torah of that time. When he observed that the Jews did not faithfully follow the commandments he tore his clothes, gave himself over to fasting and grew melancholy. Later there arrived Nehemiah Ben Chachalia, the cup bearer of Artaxerxes, and together they introduced regulations which later became laws. Their first move was to nullify all mixed marriages and to expel the non-Jewish wives together with their children. They were strict in preserving the purity of the race in spite of the fact that the richest and most prominent Jews, not excluding the family of the High Priest, intermarried with non-Jews.
The main achievement of the Great Synagogue was in purifying the Jewish faith from imitation of the customs of other peoples which the Jews at that time freely engaged in. In order to prevent a return to idol worshipping, as occurred in the time of the first Temple, the Great Synagogue prohibited the erection of altars for offering sacrifices outside of Jerusalem. Instead they established prayers by means of which a person could praise his Creator in a few heart-felt words without having to resort to the blood of a sacrificed animal to attain nearness to God. The Talmud indirectly refers to this achievement when it states that the Great Synagogue killed the “Tempter” of idol worship. Of equal importance were the regulations of the Great Synagogue regarding inter-family marriages of which the Talmud says that “they captured the ‘Tempter’ of love and blinded his eyes.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא ס״ט ב׳.</span></i>
In addition the Great Synagogue established the correct form of every word in the Bible. They introduced the custom of having all the inhabitants of the villages surrounding Jerusalem meet every Monday and Thursday to hear the reading of a chapter of the Torah. In Jerusalem itself the whole weekly portion was read every Saturday. They established a new calendar so that the count of years should begin with Tishri instead of Nisan, and that the day of the blowing of the ram’s horn, the first day of Tishri, should be the New Year.
Many of the old institutions of the Temple were dispensed with. Thus no “Cherubim” were made for the second Temple because when Nebuchadnezzar’s soldiers destroyed the first Temple they carried out the Cherubim and exhibited them as the Jewish God. The Jubilee was also done away with; since it was prohibited to hold Jewish slaves it was no longer necessary to observe a Jubilee to free such slaves. The “Urim and Thummim” were also done away with, although the High Priest retained all of the other vestments.
The Great Synagogue also appointed judges in all places where Jews resided so that everyone could find justice according to the laws of the Torah. They determined the content of “Tefillin” and “Mezuzoth” on the door posts and tightened all prohibitions, even forbidding many things which were previously permitted. This was done to prevent laxity in the observance of all prohibitions. The commandment of the Torah “an eye for an eye” they interpreted to mean that monetary compensation should be granted to the victim for the damage caused him instead of the literal meaning which is implied in Leviticus 24, 2.
The necessity for preserving the oral law from getting lost was especially keenly felt about the interpretations of the commandments. When sacrifices were done away with and prayers took their place it was necessary to codify the laws pertaining to prayers as well as to elucidate those laws which were not clearly explained in the Torah. In addition there was the constant change in the concepts of the people going on over a period of seven centuries. When the Jews returned to Palestine from the Babylonian exile they were primarily tillers of the soil and shepherds. Later there arose a class of wage workers, merchants and artisans. This necessitated new interpretations of the laws to conform with the development of the times.
Out of all these interpretations there developed a wide literature whose content is the pride of the Jewish nation. This includes sixty tractates of the Talmud in two different texts and in addition Tosephta, Safra, Sifri, Mechilta together with hundreds of various Midrashim.
This whole literature is divided into Halacha and Hagadah. The Halacha includes the injunctions of the law. The Hagadah, on the other hand, introduces a living spirit into the dry legal commandments; it enriches the law with poetic softness and lends to it characteristic beauty. The “Halacha” teaches how to observe the Sabbath and the feast days, how to make a Succah, what four kinds of plants are to be used on Succoth. The “Hagadah” explains the spiritual value of the Sabbath as well as the significance of the other feast days and their attendant customs. Both the Halacha and the Hagadah are basic foundations of the oral law and are of equal worth to the development of Judaism.
Concerning the Hagadah it is also worth remarking that it is of special significance for another reason. It deals continually with the concepts of justice even as it is concerned with the attributes of godliness. It relates many historical events, it cites scientific and medical knowledge as well as proverbs and axiomatic truths of life which accumulated among the Jews in the course of those seven centuries.
In the Halacha we find those religious injunctions which a Jew must follow as well as the code of just relationships between man and man. These two types of law the Talmud refers to as prohibitions and laws. The expounders of these two types of law are divided into two classes. One carries greater authority in religious matters and the other in matters pertaining to human relationship.
The scholars endeavored to define the boundaries of the “fence around the Torah” which the members of the Great Synagogue ordered to be erected in so far as this pertained to the religious regulations. But some of these limitations were considered too extreme by the later scholars and the Tanaim who created the Mishna ruled that “whoever attempts to interpret a law more severely than is accepted must prove his source of authority.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ידים, פרק ד׳ משנה ג׳.</span></i> Afterward it was said that “anyone who attempts to abide by the restrictions of the school of Shamai and the school of Hillel is like a foolish man who walks in the darkness”<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין ו׳ ב׳.</span></i> and Rabbi Chya warned against attaching more importance to the “fence around the Torah” than to the essence of the Torah itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה י״ט ד׳.</span></i>
It was for this reason that the scholars objected to having the people assume obligations to perform deeds which the law did not impose upon them and they said that whoever does something which is not made obligatory by law may be called a simpleton.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שבת פרק א׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i> One of the Amoraim expressed this attitude in the following words: “Are there not enough prohibitions in the Torah already that one should seek to establish still other prohibitions?”<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שבת פרק ז׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i> and although some of the scholars were strict in the enforcement of certain rabbinical commandments, even stricter than in their interpretations of the commandments of the Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ד׳ ב׳; סנהדרין פ״ח ב׳.</span></i> the general tendency was nevertheless to lighten the burden of the observance of the laws.
This “fence around the Torah,” which the scholars erected, was very timely because the masses of the people were not acquainted with the precepts of the law. From these preventive measures there later developed numerous and various laws as, for instance, the restrictions pertaining to regulations concerning marriage, of which it was said that they are like a garden watchman—if a man watches his garden from the outside he protects it completely.
Very much concerned for the sanctity of morals and the purity of people’s lives, the scholars ruled that a man might not remain alone with a strange woman in an unfrequented place. However, there are indications that this prohibition is derived from a much earlier period.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין פּ׳ ב׳.</span></i> In addition to the prohibitions of adultery which are listed in the Torah (Leviticus, 18), the scholars also prohibited marriage between twenty-six different degrees of relatives.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות כ״א א׳; ירושלמי יבמות פרק ב׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
Since the Sabbath was not properly observed in previous generations until the days of Ezra and Nehemiah, the people were warned to observe this day and to sanctify it by means of the restriction of its regulations in order to avoid false interpretations as to what may be done on that day and to prevent people from performing work which is not allowed. At this time the exact meaning of the word <span dir="rtl">מלאכה</span> (work) was defined in order that everyone should know what work is permissible on the Sabbath. The scholars enumerated 39 major types of work which are forbidden on the Sabbath and the performance of which is punishable by death or by flogging. Among these are the following: sowing, plowing, reaping, hauling grain from the field, threshing, baking and cooking, lighting or putting out a fire, hunting, slaughtering, cultivating fields, writing and erasing, building and wrecking, sewing and tearing, carrying objects from a house to the street and vice versa.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ע״ג א׳.</span></i>
In addition to these occupations they forbade many other activities, which do not properly speaking constitute work, but which introduce a week day atmosphere such as, climbing a tree, riding on an animal, swimming, judging, buying and selling, getting married and similar pursuits. All of these activities may not be performed on the Sabbath in order to insure complete rest and are also forbidden on feast days.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ביצה ל״ו ב׳.</span></i>
Out of concern for the sanctity of the Sabbath, the scholars prohibited the carrying into the street of such objects as are used in the performance of week day labor. In order to safeguard the Sabbath they ruled that it is to be observed from sunset on Friday till the stars appear on Saturday. At the same time they introduced the custom of pronouncing the Kiddush (sanctification) and Havdalah (separation) over a glass of wine at the beginning and at the departure of the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ל״ג א׳.</span></i>
There also was appointed a man who was to give the signal with a Shofar (ram’s horn) for everyone to stop working. The first blowing of the shofar was a signal to the laborers in the fields to cease working; the second blast of the shofar was a signal to the merchants and artisans in the city to put away their work; the third blast was signal to stop all work in one’s house. The shofar was blown once more as a sign that the Sabbath has begun.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ל״ה ב׳; שבת קי״ד א׳; סוכה נ״ז ב׳; חולין כ״ו ב׳.</span></i>
Particular effort was exerted by the scholars to remove the disabilities and difficulties which surrounded deserted wives. This need was very keenly felt at that time due to the fact that many men had to leave their homes in search of a livelihood. The highways were then unsafe and many of these men lost their lives or were captured and sold as slaves after which they were never heard of again and the status of their wives remained indefinite.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ג׳ א׳; י״ט ב׳.</span></i> Similarly an attempt was made to facilitate the procedure of buying land in Palestine from non Jews. It was ruled that such a bill of sale might be drawn up even on the Sabbath. In the Talmud we find a query in this matter: “How can one write such a contract on Saturday? How would that be possible?” The answer given to this question was that it is permissible to have such a contract drawn up on the Sabbath by a non-Jew, while other activities may not be performed on the Sabbath even through the agency of a non-Jew.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ח׳ ב׳.</span></i>
It was also accepted as a rule that just as it is forbidden to declare the impure to be pure even so is forbidden to declare the pure to be impure.<sup class="footnote-marker">15a)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">15א) ירושלמי סוטה פרק ח׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i> Rabbi Nehunia b. Hakana therefore constantly prayed to be preserved from declaring the pure to be impure, and the impure to be pure<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות כ״ח ב׳.</span></i> and whenever the scholars prohibited certain actions to be performed or pleasures to be enjoyed, they carefully determined beforehand whether the people could abide by these restrictions.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא ס׳ ב׳; עבודה זרה ל׳ א׳.</span></i> It is therefore interesting to note that they applied the rule of the “greater power of leniency” only in religious questions. Only in such questions did the school of Hillel decide in favor of leniency and the law remained according to the decisions of the school of Hillel.<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין י״ג ב׳.</span></i>
But their attitude was different whenever the law involved relations between people. In such a case our scholars studied the problem in all its implications and always considered it on its own merits in an attempt to avoid the severity of the rule which claimed that “the law must penetrate mountains.” They believed that Jerusalem was destroyed because its people insisted on enforcing the letter of the law and did not practice mercy outside of the law.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא ל׳ ב.</span></i>
The scholars therefore maintained that the aim of the Torah was not to impose stringent legislation but to encourage the practice of kindness among people. They said that whenever a man aids his neighbor with money or by means of other good deeds but he does so only out of a feeling of duty then such deeds are not acceptable to God because they lack love and generosity.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוכה מ״ט ב׳.</span></i> Similarly they believed that even the study of the Torah is worthless when it is not accompanied by kindness to other people.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ק״ט ב׳.</span></i>
Harmony between husband and wife they held to be the very foundation of family life and they said: “Whoever loves his wife even as he loves himself and respects her more than he respects himself and leads his children in the proper ways and loves his neighbors and welcomes his relatives, such a man fulfills the wishes of God.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ס״ב ב׳.</span></i> The scholars also instructed that man should not be partial in his love for his children and should show no favoritism in the division of the inheritance even in order to compensate a good son at the expense of a wicked one.<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא קל״ג ב׳.</span></i>
As an example of the fear of God the scholars extolled Job and they cited Abraham as an example of the love of God. Both of these were ready to overlook their own comfort and dignity in order to be of use to others. Therefore a man must permit himself to be insulted rather than to insult others; if a man is slandered he should not reply in kind; he must fulfill the commandments out of love and he should rejoice in his suffering.<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא כ״ג א׳</span></i> Similarly a man must permit himself to be persecuted without persecuting others.<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא צ״ג א׳.</span></i>
In addition to the above virtues the Talmud defined the ideal person as a scholar, “Talmid Chochom,” who strives only for the Torah and whose innermost wish is to attain a high degree of morality in his relations with God and man. But who is to be considered a “Talmid Chochom”? The Talmud says that a “Talmid Chochom” is a person who can answer a question of law whenever he is asked. Others maintain that a “Talmid Chochom” is one who disregards his own interests and devotes himself to godly matters solely.<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ד ב׳.</span></i>
Such “Talmide Chachomim” (scholars) must always endeavor to set an example for others with their behavior as well as by their exterior appearance. A scholar must not allow his clothes to be spotted and must keep himself as attractive as a girl.<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">איכה רבתי א׳ ד׳.</span></i> He must also maintain better manners than others while eating, sitting down, standing up and walking about the street.<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">דרך ארץ זוטא פרק ד׳—ה׳.</span></i>
Various commandments of the Torah were observed by Jews even before the Torah was handed down. After they received the Torah it was only necessary to define and to strengthen these long since accepted commandments. When the Talmud states that Abraham observed all the commandments including “Eruv Tavshilin,<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא כ״ה ב׳.</span></i> it expresses a profound idea that most of the laws which the scholars read into the Torah were operative among Jews for a long time preceding the giving of the Torah.
It is not necessary here to describe what “Tefillin” (phylacteries) are. But it is interesting to note that the Mishna makes no mention of the laws pertaining to phylacteries, nor of their appearance and how they should be made. Likewise it makes no mention of the benedictions that have to be pronounced over the phylacteries. It is therefore safe to assume that all of these laws were well known during the time that the Mishna was created. But later scholars feared that the laws and customs pertaining to phylacteries might be forgotten and they therefore had them written down.
The phylacteries contain four passages of the Bible which refer to the deliverance from Egypt and mention is also made of the injunction that “these words shall be a sign upon your arm and a decoration between the eyes.” For the concept of decoration the text employs the Hebrew word “Totefeth.” The scholars tried to explain this word to prove that phylacteries must contain four passages. Using the fact that the word “Totafoth,” which appears three times, is written once in abbreviated form without the letter “vav” and twice with the letters “vav” they tried to conclude from this that all four passages must be included in the phylacteries. At a later date Rabbi Akiba, who always forced the texts to prove his contentions, tried to deduce the same conclusion in a different manner. He explained the word “Totefeth” to mean four on the basis of two ancient tongues.<sup class="footnote-marker">30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ד׳ ב׳; זבחים ל״ז ב׳; מנחות ל״ד ב׳.</span></i>
The word “Totefeth” is also mentioned once in the Mishnah and is meant to be a forehead piece. Interpreters declare it to be a decoration worn instead of phylacteries. In the Talmud the word “Totefeth” is used once and is synonymous with phylacteries.<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא ל״ג ב׳.</span></i>
Long before the Torah was handed down it was the accepted custom among all nations that priests, as well as all other people who deal with religious matters, should wear religious emblems to distinguish them as men who are devoted to godly service. In later years, this custom of distinguishing between people according to their office, was also transferred to social and political life. Leaders of the army and officials thus carried special insignia to mark them as servants of the government. In a similar manner Jews adopted phylacteries to symbolize that their bearers are in the service of God.
It is therefore essential to know that even though the commandment to wear phylacteries is not expressly stated in the Torah and is only sanctioned by tradition and despite the fact that it is possible to interpret the word “Totefeth” differently, there is nevertheless not the slightest doubt that the law of wearing phylacteries was in effect among Jews at all times. As additional proof of this we may adduce the fact told by R. Azariah of the Adomim that when Ptolemy, the king of Egypt, sent messengers to Jerusalem to learn about the Jewish religion, the high priest Eleazar explained to them the custom of wearing phylacteries.
There is a dispute in the Talmud whether phylacteries should be worn on Saturday. Rabbi Akiba is of the opinion that since phylacteries are worn as a reminder of the deliverance from Egypt it is not necessary to wear them on those days which serve, in themselves, as reminders of this event such as the Sabbath and the feast days. The question as to whether they should be worn at night he answers in the affirmative.<sup class="footnote-marker">32)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין צ״ו א׳.</span></i>
Women, slaves and children are not obliged to wear phylacteries.<sup class="footnote-marker">33)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות כ׳ ב׳.</span></i> The Talmud derives this conclusion from the well known rule that women are exempt from all those positive commandments which depend on a definite time.<sup class="footnote-marker">34)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין כ״ט א׳.</span></i> It is characteristic that on another occasion the Talmud questions the authority of this rule and finds substantiation for it in the law of phylacteries. “Since phylacteries are obligatory only during a definite time and women are exempt from this commandment, it follows that women are exempt from any commandment which is obligatory only during a definite time.”<sup class="footnote-marker">35)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ל״ד א׳.</span></i> This logical conclusion regarding the exemption of women from the law of phylacteries thus proceeds in two directions. On the one hand it liberates women from this law and then it proceeds to liberate them from all laws which have the common time characteristic with it.
Phylacteries, as was explained before, are an emblem which indicates that those who wear them are devoted to God solely and do not recognize any other authority. But women, according to the concepts of that time, were the property of their husbands and a married woman was as obedient as a slave and was not the mistress of her actions. For this reason women could not wear phylacteries. It is told, however, that Michal the daughter of Kushi, (in the opinion of some she is identified with Michal the daughter of Saul) did wear phylacteries.<sup class="footnote-marker">36)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין צ״ו א׳.</span></i> This conclusion is derived from the fact that Michal the daughter of Saul once spoke sharply to king David. (Samuel II, Ch. 6.) There is also the case of one other woman, whose name remains unknown, who wrote the phylacteries for her husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">37)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בכורות ל׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Slaves were considered in the same category as women in the matter of phylacteries. Since “Tefillin” contain the statement that God is the only lord of the world, it was impossible for a person who recognized the overlordship of a human being to wear them. Mention is made, however, of one Tabai, a slave of Rabbi Gamaliel, who wore phylacteries.<sup class="footnote-marker">38)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכילתא פ׳ בא.</span></i>
The opinions of the scholars regarding God were highly original when compared to the prevailing concepts of that time. These opinions differed from those of the nations among whom the Jews lived. Greek culture had attained a high level of perfection but the Greeks still clung to polytheism. The same was true of the Romans, the Parthians and the Persians. In later years the Christians tried to prove that the trinity was a direct continuation of the Jewish faith. One is therefore astounded when he realizes the fortitude of our scholars and their success in their struggle against attempts to introduce competing deities.
The representation of God in a corporeal form, such as the sayings: the hand of God, the mouth of God, the foot of God, the back of God, the scholars explained by the need to describe Him in a manner that should be understandable according to human concepts. At the same time they expressly stated that under no circumstance must these concepts be understood literally that God possesses a hand, a foot or a mouth.<sup class="footnote-marker">39)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכילתא פ׳ יתרו.</span></i>
The scholars then began to refer to God with names whose aim was to elevate the idea of God above human concepts. They referred to Him with the word “Shechinah” which means that grace which emanates from the godly majesty. At times they called Him “Gevurah,” in an attempt to convey the idea that he represents strength. Similarly they used the name “Makom” (place) because he is present everywhere, and “Shomaim” (Heaven) after the name of his residence. It is also characteristic that these names were not invented by the scholars but were current long before that.
The creation of the world they explained as creation ex nihilo. The central aim of creation was man, who was made in the image of God, whose face turns heavenward and who stands upright on his feet. Man possesses a soul and a free will to do as he chooses. Speaking of man, they considered the Jews to be the chosen people; within the Jewish people the pious and righteous man was the one elect.<sup class="footnote-marker">40)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא ל״ח ב׳.</span></i>
The idea of God’s unity, our scholars held to be of the highest importance. They considered it to be a privilege for the Jews to recognize God as the only creator and to be recognized by Him as the chosen people.<sup class="footnote-marker">41)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ו׳ א׳.</span></i> Jews also took an oath not to change their God.<sup class="footnote-marker">42)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין נ״ו ב׳.</span></i> The reason why man was created on Friday before sunset, after all else was created, they explained as a lesson in modesty to man that he should not attempt to set himself up as a partner to God in the work of creation.<sup class="footnote-marker">43)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרֿין ל״ח ב׳.</span></i>
Thus it was stated in the name of God: “I am first and I have no father, I am also last and I have no brother, there is no God outside of me because I have no son.”<sup class="footnote-marker">44)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שמות רבה כ״ט ד׳.</span></i> Similarly they taught that God is one and eternal, without body and unchangeable. God said to Moses: “I shall be where I shall be” which was interpreted to mean: “I have been long before, I am now and I shall be the same in all time to come.”<sup class="footnote-marker">45)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שמות רבה ו׳ ו׳.</span></i>
When studying the Torah one must aim to observe its commandments. Observation of the commandments is also conditioned by faith in Him who gave the commandments. The Jew was also enjoined to do all things for the sake of God and not merely out of feeling of duty or because he was persuaded that these things must be done.
Faith imposes the obligation to accept the authority of the “kingdom of heaven” and it includes the duty of thanking God on all occasions for the favors as well as for the hardships; one must also submit to the guidance of God and believe that whatever He does is ultimately for the best. It is necessary to serve Him out of love and to endeavor to make others love him. In doing so man’s behavior will become akin to that of God; even as God practices compassion and mercy so also must man strive to attain these virtues.
Before the reciting of prayers was introduced it was customary to offer sacrifices. The offering of sacrifices was not a brutal murderous procedure but aimed at the purification of a man’s thoughts.<sup class="footnote-marker">46)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מדרש תנחומא פ׳ שמיני.</span></i> After the temple was destroyed it only remained possible to take a vow of abstinence (Nazarite), to refrain from drinking wine or cutting one’s hair or to observe a fast day and thus inflict suffering on one’s self through abstaining from all food and drink.
Most important of all is charity which one contributes with his money or by means of personal effort on behalf of another person. Charity is founded in love of one person for another which Hillel expressed as a rule of the Torah: “Do not unto others what you would not have done unto yourself.”
When observing this rule one is led to the practice of true justice, mercy and compassion toward all living things including animals.
Another desirable trait is to preach moral truths to others. A Jew is under obligation to preach to others until the person being corrected becomes angry and shouts and is ready to curse and to beat the moralist.<sup class="footnote-marker">47)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערכין ט״ז ב׳.</span></i> This trait acts as a safeguard against gossip, hatred and envy; it leads one to seek peace and friendship with others and eliminates the desire to cause damage to others.
One must also believe that God sees all the actions of man, that He knows the needs of the whole world and helps everyone; He particularly aids the Jews because of their justice and their faith in his mercy.
God’s messengers are the angels, the prophets and the just men. The piety of a just man may lead him to the “holy spirit” and such a man can achieve great things for Jews through prayer. Repentance similarly safeguards people from evil.<sup class="footnote-marker">48)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי פּאָה פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
But the most beautiful element of the faith is the belief in compensation and punishment. After his death, man is compensated for his good deeds and punished for his evil doing; children of good parents are credited with the deeds of their forefathers. And even as the individual meets with justice after death so also does the group. For the nation this assumes the form of the coming of Messiah and the coming to life of the dead. Of these matters the scholars spoke briefly when they referred to the “wars of Gog and Magog,” the “pains of Messiah,” the return of the “kingdom of David,” the “future that is to come” and others. All of these were to compensate the nation for the suffering which it has to endure in the present.
In the course of the generations there at times arose groups or individuals who questioned the validity of the “oral law” and asked: “Of what use are these interpretations of the scholars? Have they ever permitted the eating of a raven or forbidden the eating of a dove?”<sup class="footnote-marker">49)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין צ״ט ב׳.</span></i> But none of these opposed the moral views of the scholars for even the opponents of the “oral law” understood that it is possible to condemn certain interpretations of the Torah but that the moral teachings are so important and of such a humanitarian character that one can not oppose them.
The measures of God’s justice are mercy and truth. This is also the meaning of the verse “Your justice is like the mountains of God; your verdict like a deep abyss,” for if His justice were not like the highest mountains, who would be able to withstand his verdicts?<sup class="footnote-marker">50)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערכין ח׳ ב׳.</span></i>
When God sits in judgment over man He does not consider man’s previous deeds nor his possible future deeds but only the actions of the moment of trial.<sup class="footnote-marker">51)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה ט״ז ב׳.</span></i> But God is strict with just men and punishes them for every little ransgression.<sup class="footnote-marker">52)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות קכ״א ב׳.</span></i>
From among all the nations—the scholars believed—God chose the Jews as his beloved children.<sup class="footnote-marker">53)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות ג׳ י״ד.</span></i> The Jews are likened to oil; just as oil gives light even so are the Jews the light of the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">54)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שיר השירים רבה א׳ כ׳.</span></i> Because God loves the Jews he called them his first born children.<sup class="footnote-marker">55)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ל״א א׳.</span></i> It is therefore a great virtue to sanctify His name. The Torah was given in order that God’s name be sanctified throughout the world. Whenever there exists the danger that God’s name will be profaned, one must do all in his power to prevent it.<sup class="footnote-marker">56)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין מ׳ א׳; יבמות ע״ט ב׳.</span></i>
Nevertheless, the scholars were willing to grant that there is a possibility that the Torah is not the only means to vanquish passion in man for one must also possess piety. A man who knows the Torah but possesses no piety, they likened to a manager of a palace who was given only the inner but not the outer keys to the palace.<sup class="footnote-marker">57)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ל״א ב׳.</span></i>

The Three Main Parties of the Talmudic Period; The Pharisees, The Sadducees, The Essenes

F<small>OLLOWING</small> closely upon the victory of the Hasmoneans over the Greek armies and their Jewish proteges, there began a dispute over the interpretation of the commandments of the Pentateuch concerning which many of the scholars held varying opinions. These disputes were frequently so serious that they constituted a threat to the existence of the nation.
Out of these disputes there emerged three main tendencies which eventually crystallized into three different parties: the Pharisees, the Saducees and the Essenes.
In general it is impossible to grasp the spirit of the Talmud and to understand clearly the teachings of its authors if one does not previously acquaint himself with the tendencies of these parties. It is also necessary to know that nearly all of the authors of the Talmud were Pharisees and that their spirit impressed its stamp on the Talmud, although it also contains numerous aphorisms by people who frequently joked at the expense of the Pharisees.
It is worth noting that the Pharisees were active in establishing regulations over the conduct of Judaism that would serve as a defensive wall about the Torah. To this end many laws of the Torah were made more severe and others assumed a form which to the casual observer seemed to deviate from the original text. These interpretations were generally based on traditions which in turn had to be substantiated by the Torah. These different opinions were sharply disputed until the people were divided into the above mentioned three parties which afterward attacked each other.
Many of the Pharisees practiced such extreme piety that they renounced all earthly pleasures and by their actions and customs they set themselves apart from the rest of the population. On the other hand, there were many people who refused to recognize any interpretation of the law which, to them, seemed to be in disagreement with its literal meaning. These people particularly objected to the restrictions of the “oral law”. They allied themselves with those who fought against the laws that were based on tradition. The opponents of the Pharisees argued that the devotion of the Pharisees to the interpretations goes to such extremes of unreasoning belief that were their leaders to tell them that right is left and vice versa, they would unquestioningly obey the advice of their teachers.
The opponents of the Pharisees numbered in their midst the rich and politically influential Jews who felt that their attempts to attain closer spiritual relations with the neighboring peoples were hindered by the activities of the Pharisees. They particularly opposed the Pharisees because of the latter’s devotion to faith and because of their lack of concern for the other problems of life. The Pharisees, on the other hand, held these views because of their conviction that man can achieve nothing without God’s consent and that every attempt which runs counter to God’s will is doomed to fail.
Separated from all other people by their manner of observing the Jewish customs, the Pharisees considered the other Jews as idol worshippers with whom no pious man should have any contact. Their very name indicated that they were a class apart in their behavior. (The Hebrew word <span dir="rtl">פּרושים</span> means people separated or isolated.) They were especially severe in their observance of the laws pertaining to cleanliness and the paying of the tithe to the Priests and Levites. They believed that forbidden foods as well as grains from which no tithe was given to the priests were impure. The Pharisees were also careful to observe all the dietary rules of cleanliness even when they ate ordinary food and not that of sacrifices.
As a pious precaution, many Pharisees abstained from dealing with the so-called “Ame Aratzim” (people of the soil). A Pharisee would not eat at the same table with an “Am Ha’Aretz” out of suspicion that the latter may not have contributed his share to the Priests and Levites. Neither would a Pharisee buy from or sell to an “Am Ha’Aretz”, nor invite one to his house, nor go visiting into the house of an “Am Ha’Aretz”.
The name “Am Ha’Aretz” was at that time applied primarily to tillers of the soil. Although agricultural work, as such, was highly regarded by the scholars, many of them openly confessed their dislike for the “Am Ha’Aretz”, the man of the soil. Certain historians try to interpret this attitude as an indication that the tillers of the soil were not racially pure and freely inter-married with their gentile neighbors. In the Talmud there are widely diverging opinions as to which people should be classified as “Am Ha’Aretz”. Some would have it that an “Am Ha’Aretz” is a person who does not contribute the tithe from the fruit of his land. Rabbi Eliezer held that an “Am Ha’Aretz” is one who does not recite the prayer “Shema” morning and evening. Rabbi Joshua said an “Am Ha’Aretz” is one who does not wear Phylacteries. Ben Azai said it is one who does not wear fringes. Rabbi Nathan said it is one who has no Mezuzah on his door; Rabbi Nathan, the son of Joseph, said it is one who does not raise his children in the knowledge of the Torah. Others contended that even if a person studied much himself but did not serve other scholars, he deserves to be called an “Am Ha’Aretz.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות מ״ז ב׳.</span></i>
The Pharisees disdained an “Am Ha’Aretz”. From other sources in the Talmud we know that the “Am Ha’Aretz” hated scholars.
Concerning the meaning of the word “Pharisees” it was noted above that it indicates people who separated themselves from all others by their behavior. Others would have it that the name derives from the fact that they devoted themselves to interpreting the law as they saw fit in order to adapt the religious commandments to the needs of the times. Since the Pharisees deeply understood the spirit of the Torah, they gave up the search for pleasure in life even as they avoided pride or any action which might seem immoral. They practiced brotherly love toward one another and each individual sought with all his might to avoid temptation.
The Pharisees were organized as a society and every member was addressed as “Friend”. This was not a closed organization and it did not limit its membership. Any person could join if he promised, in the presence of three members, to observe the rules of the organization which concentrated on cleanliness and ablutions. It is interesting to note that in accepting a new member no distinction was made between a scholar and an uneducated person. Both were considered of equal worth and any person who was willing to assume the burdens of Pharisaism could join the society.
As soon as a person became a member of the Pharisee society he undertook to serve God with his whole life. Such a person had to believe that God’s eye is all-seeing and that He observes all man’s acts in order to judge them for every injustice. Since man possesses a free will to do as he chooses he is held responsible for every act and he will have to account for his deeds before his Creator. The Pharisees also believed that God sometimes issues decrees governing nations or all of humanity and that such decrees may seem unreasonable to the victims. But such decrees are certainly just since God is just to the individual as well as to a group. If it appears that reward for good deeds or punishment for wrong doing is delayed, then one must remember that there is a reckoning after death, or later yet, when the dead will be resurrected, the deserving ones to eternal life and the evil ones to everlasting shame and suffering.
The Pharisees were very careful in their judgment of people and events. This is clearly seen from their verdicts involving physical punishment. They also treated everyone modestly; they received people kindly and tried to do good deeds to others, in so far as they could, at times even going beyond the limits of their strength. They were, therefore, deeply loved by the people and enjoyed their fullest confidence.
But what frequently happens to many high minded people also happened to the Pharisees. In spite of their good qualities, many people doubted the purity of their motives and they were suspected of doing many things in order to deceive their neighbors.
A specially strong hatred toward the Pharisees is evidenced by the New Testament. As a result of this the term “Pharisee” is today employed in world literature as a derogatory term and has become synonymous with a hypocrite. In other Christian writings the Pharisees are pictured as people who outwardly abstain from earthly pleasures but lead immoral lives. They are said to refuse to eat honey from impure bees, but do not abstain from pork. They are accused of fasting in order to atone for their sins against God even while they plan to deceive their neighbors.
It is probably true that among such a large group as the Pharisees were there must have been a number of individuals who were dishonest in their convictions. But it is also certain that the majority was honest, or they could not have maintained the leadership of the nation in those times.
It was remarked above that some of the scholars ridiculed the Pharisees. They portrayed seven different types, none of which was presented in a favorable light. The seven types are as follows: 1) One who is pious as Shechem, the son of Chamor, who was circumcised in order to obtain Dinah. 2) One who goes about with bowed head and hardly dares to raise his feet off the ground in order to display his modesty. 3) One who beats his head against a wall or goes about with closed eyes so as not to look at women. 4) One who goes about with twisted neck and head bowed like a hammer. 5) One who would persuade people that he has already done everything and challenges them to point out something he has not done yet. 6) One who does good deeds out of love for the reward which they bring. 7) One who obeys the law out of fear of the punishment which disobedience will bring.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה ב״ב ב׳.</span></i>
_____
T<small>HE</small> S<small>ADDUCEES</small> were the second largest party among the Jews during the creation of the Talmud and they were separated from the Pharisees by a wide spiritual gulf. It is believed that the principles which were accepted among the Sadducees originated in the misconceptions of Zadok and Boetus (pupils of Antigonos of Socho). Other historians hold a different opinion. Those claim that the Sadducees were descendants or disciples of the Zadok family which was a part of the priestly aristocracy and produced numerous high priests in the course of several centuries. When, in later years, the Hasmoneans triumphed over the Greeks, they also took over the high priests’ office. Thus ousted from power, the descendants of Zadok were forced into a status of opposition to the majority of Jewish leadership.
The first source of friction between the Sadducees and Pharisees was thus purely political and only at a later date did it develop into an acute religious dispute. There is also no cause to doubt the Talmudic tradition that the Sadducees were the followers of Zadok and Boetus and at the same time to accept the theory of the historians that they were the descendants of the house of Zadok who allied themselves with these followers in undermining the foundations of Jewish traditions.
But it would be incorrect to maintain that the Sadducees completely rejected the traditional interpretations of the law. They too held to numerous traditions and many of their interpretations of the religious law were substantially the same as those of the Pharisees. They had their own “Book of Decrees” (<span dir="rtl">ספר הגזרות</span>) which expounded their explanations of the commandments of the Torah and, in spite of their desire to resemble the other nations in behavior, they also observed some customs which tended to set them apart from the Gentiles.
The customs of the Sadducees, at any rate, were better adapted to the religious beliefs of the rich and the aristocracy which governed the land. But the greater the number of rich men who joined the Sadducees, the stronger became the concentration of the masses about the Pharisees and the abyss between the two grew from day to day.
The primary difference between the Sadducees and the Pharisees consisted in that the Sadducees rejected the oral law which was accepted by the Pharisees. They maintained that only the written law of the Torah was binding upon men. In rejecting the traditions of the Pharisees, they refused to believe in the resurrection of the dead, which is not explicitly promised in the Torah. They ridiculed the Pharisees for the latter’s belief in the immortality of the soul and in a life after death and made fun of the notion that the souls of the pious will rest under the throne of glory. Another subject of their humor was the Pharisees’ readiness to endure suffering in the hope of being rewarded in life to come.
The development of this party proceeded favorably because of the response which its ideas found among aristocratic and government circles which usually had the power to suppress opposition by force. There is also much justification for the view that the party of the Sadducees prospered due to the discomfiture of the Hellenists after the triumph of the Maccabees.
A major source of difference was the Pharisees’ belief that even though a man may possess a free will to do either good or evil, according to his inclination, nevertheless God controls him in everything and is the ruler of his thoughts. The Sadducees maintained that God does not interfere with man’s behavior and that no reward or punishment awaits one after death. Reward or punishment, they argued, are inherent in the deed itself.
Twelve points involving disputed interpretation of ritual and law were contested by the Sadducees who claimed that: 1) The date of the Feast of Weeks should always fall upon a Sunday. 2) The daily sacrifice is to be provided by the individual and not by the community. 3) Frankincense burned on the Day of Atonement should be kindled by the High Priest before entering the Holy of Holies. 4) The ashes of the Red Heifer sacrifice should be gathered by a man who underwent purification the same day according to Numbers 19, 9. 5) The Sadducees burned only a small share of their meal offerings and ate the rest. 6) The commandment “an eye for an eye” they interpreted literally, so that if one crippled another, he himself should be crippled in like manner. 7) In the case of a false witness whose evidence causes the defendant to be punished, the false witness was to receive the same punishment. If the judgment brought about a death sentence, the false witness was not to receive his punishment until after the defendant was executed. 8) The law that only male offspring were to share the inheritance of their father was interpreted to mean that, if the heir was an only son and he died leaving only daughters, then his sisters as well as his daughters shared the inheritance. 9) The Sadducees held that a man was responsible for damage done by his slave just as he was liable for damage done by his live stock since the slave, possessing intelligence, might have caused the damage on orders of his owner. 10) They held a utensil to be unclean if from it a liquid was poured into an unclean utensil, thus making the liquid unclean. 11) They literally adhered to the procedure prescribed for a childless widow whose dead husband’s brother refused to marry her, helding it necessary that she spit in his face while the Pharisees held that she only need spit on the ground before him. 12) They also held to the literal meaning of the injunction in Deut. 22, 17, regarding disputed virginity, while the Pharisees gave it a broader interpretation.
There were also six traditional customs, which had no sanction in the Pentateuch, which the Pharisees observed and the Sadducees rejected: 1) The pouring of water on the altar on the night following the first day of Succoth. All night water was drawn from the river Shiloah to the accompaniment of music and singing and was poured on the altar. The Sadducees ridiculed this custom as of Greek origin, but the Pharisees were devoted to it. Once, when a Sadducee priest poured the water on his feet instead of the altar, the angered populace showered him with their ethrogim and killed him. 2) The procession round the altar with willow branches was rejected by the Sadducees. When the seventh day of the Feast of Tabernacles occurred on Saturday, as was then possible due to the inaccuracies of the calendar, the Sadducees held that the custom of beating the willow branches did not supersede the Sabbath, contrary to the custom of the Pharisees. 3) They were opposed to the Phariseical custom of washing the hands after reading the Bible. 4) They opposed the inclusion of the phrase “according to the law of Moses and Israel” into the divorce certificates. Since these certificates bore the name and the year of the reign of the king, the Sadducees thought it would show disrespect for Moses to have his name appear alongside that of the king. 5) They denied the validity of Nehemiah’s injunction against carrying objects from one household to another on the Sabbath. 6) They refused to recognize the new restrictions with which the Pharisees embellished the laws pertaining to purification of women.
But in spite of the oposition of the Sadducees to the teachings of the Pharisees and in spite of their having the support of the rich and the officials, they were not strong enough to withstand the pressure of the population which was mostly on the side of the Pharisees and was ready to defend its convictions with its very life.
Many customs were introduced by the Pharisees purely out of spite for the Sadducees. They endeavored to impress the people that under no circumstances must they act according to the dictates of the Sadducees even when these were nearly accurate. The Pharisees established the date of the Feast of Weeks on the sixth day of Sivan which, according to their calculations, was the date of the giving of the Torah. In the prayers to be recited on that day they included the words “the time our Torah was given” in order to strengthen the conviction that this feast was celebrated in commemoration of the giving of the Torah and not as a celebration of the bringing of the first fruits.

T<small>HE THIRD</small> significant party in Jewish life of that time were the Essenes. This party left no permanent imprint on Jewish life and even when it was at its zenith it did not occupy a prominent place. From the Pharisees have evolved the Jews of the present day whose customs and beliefs are based on the Talmudic interpretations of the Torah. From the Sadducees in later times evolved the sect of the Karaites who represent the same mode of thinking. Of the Essenes we can only say that the early Christians conducted themselves along similar lines.
The development of the Essenes began in the early years of the Hasmoneans, and they are derived from the “Chassidim” of that time who fought against the Syrian Greeks under the banner of Judah Macabee and his brothers. They were those who would rather undergo martyrdom than do anything which might make them suspect of imitating the Greeks. However, many of them became dissatisfied with the situation even as it existed after the victory of the Maccabees. To them the behavior of the Hasmoneans was not sufficiently Jewish. They fled the cities and sought refuge in the mountains where they lived in an unusual manner apart from everyone else and awaited a change in the direction of Jewish ideas.
The meaning of the name Essenes is not entirely clear. Josephus called them Essenes; in Hebrew they are referred to as <span dir="rtl">״אסיים״</span>. Some historians claim it means modest, others say it means shy. Another version interprets the name as “healers” because the Essenes devoted themselves to healing the sick. The Talmud refers to them as “morning baptists” due to their habit of performing long morning ablutions. They were sometimes called pious fools and the Talmud defines a pious fool as a person who would not rescue a drowning woman for fear of touching her.
The conduct of the Essenes was not always the same and in the course of time it changed although the basic principles remained constant. Their main idea was to avoid impurity of the body because of their belief that an impure body harbors an impure soul. Because of this fear of an impure soul the Essenes refused to marry. They considered woman as the source of immorality and discord. However, they later realized that by not marrying their society constantly diminishes and some of their members decided to marry in order to bring children into the world. The rest stubbornly clung to the original principle and remained unmarried till their death.
The Essenes did not follow any employment at first since they believed that all work soils the body. When they suffered a shortage of food because no outsider would provide for their needs, they refused to steal and since there were not enough fruit trees and wild grasses to subsist on, they decided that work is permissible and they engaged in agriculture.
Some customs of the Essenes remained unchanged. When a person was sworn into their society he had to promise never to take an oath again, even if it was to tell the truth and his very life depended on taking the oath. They also believed that by means of their special customs they could become imbued with the holy spirit and be able to foresee the future. They had their special books which they successfully guarded from the eyes of strangers even as they avoided coming in contact with people holding other beliefs. Some of them devoted themselves to healing the sick with various grasses and herbs; others did their healing with the aid of incantations and prayers to the angels in charge of cures whose names they knew. Instead of bringing sacrifices, the Essenes offered prayers which generally began with praise to the Creator of light who “daily repeats the miracles of Genesis.”
The Essenes never consumed food or drink which was not absolutely essential for the maintenance of life. They ate no meat and drank no wine and did not seek any pleasure in life. On the contrary, they hardened their bodies and gloried in suffering. Slavery they considered shameful because all men are brothers and as long as a man can serve himself he has no right to allow himself to be served by others. Every member of their society received what he needed free. They avoided anger and their word was sacred. They respected each other and even refrained from spitting in the presence of another person.
There were neither poor nor rich among the Essenes, for every person who joined them had to give all of his possessions to the society. Young and old, they all wore similar linen clothing which they guarded, just as carefully as they guarded their bodies, against dirt and the slightest spot, for they held cleanliness to be a decoration for a human being. Nevertheless they did not don any new garment as long as the old one could still be used.
They observed all the minutest regulations pertaining to Sabbath until it practically became a fast day for them. Since cooking was prohibited they ate nothing but dry bread, neither would they take any object into their hands and none of them even rose from their places on this day.
Many customs which the Pharisee scholars introduced into Jewish life were meant to be a protest against the Essenes. Since the Essenes did not eat meat nor drink wine and narrowly circumscribed their actions on the Sabbath, the Pharisee scholars expressly commanded that people should joyfully celebrate the Sabbath with meat and wine. Thus they also permitted the carrying of certain objects from one place to another (within the same household). When the Essenes became more strict and prohibited the lifting up of any object on the Sabbath, the scholars relented and permitted the touching of any vessel which is a bodily necessity or convenience, with the exception of tools which are used in every day labor. When the Essenes refused to marry, the Pharisees declared that any person who does not marry can be compared to a murderer who diminishes the stature of the Jewish people and drives the spirit of God out of its confines. Since the Essenes healed the sick with incantations, the Pharisees announced that whoever would attempt to perform a cure by means of an incantation would lose his share in life to come.
The Essenes customarily rose before dawn and bathed in cold water both summer and winter. They then put on newly washed clothes and, without anyone uttering a word, they began their collective praise to the Creator. When the sun rose each one went to his work which lasted five hours. After that they gathered again, removed their work clothes and bathed anew; they put on different clothes and entered their meeting house where no outsider was allowed. There they ate their bread and greens, each one maintaining silence, convinced that they were performing a necessary act in sustaining the body which God gave them and which must therefore be guarded. After the meal the oldest gave praise to God for His great mercy. They then removed the clothes which they donned when eating, put on their work garments and returned to work till nightfall. With sunset the previous procedure was repeated; they bathed and again changed clothes for the evening repast.
When a newcomer desired to join the Essenes, he was not so readily accepted. The candidate was put on probation for a year to test his self-control and his ability to observe all the regulations of the society. Then he was given a white shirt, cloak and a small ax and was put to work together with the rest. When, at the end of the year, the person proved that his conduct was consistent he was allowed to perform his ablutions together with the others. However, he still was not permitted to partake of food with the rest for an additional two years. Only if he was found worthy, at the end of that time, to join the society, was he allowed to eat with the rest and the secrets of the society were confided to him. Before the candidate had his first meal together with the other members he had to take an oath that he would love and fear God above all else and with his whole soul, that he would love other people more than himself, and that he would be kind to all creatures. He had to promise not to deceive anyone even if the greatest fortune were at stake; he promised to help the oppressed, not to be haughty toward other people, to love truth and hate falsehood with his whole heart, and above all, to divulge none of the secrets of the society to any person.
Only after he was thus sworn in did the candidate become a full-fledged member of the Essene society to whom all secrets were entrusted with the assurance that he would not desecrate his oath and reveal them to others.

The Samaritans

I<small>N DESCRIBING</small> the events in the lives of the authors of the Talmud, we will have numerous occasions to refer to the Samaritans and their various attitudes to political development in Palestine. We will therefore pause to explain who these people were.
It is stated on historical grounds that the Samaritans are a mixture of a small remnant of the Ten Tribes whose kingdom in Samaria was destroyed by King Sargon of Assyria (722 B. C.). This king exiled over 27 thousand inhabitants of the Samarian population to Habor, the river Gozan, Halach and the cities of Media and in their place he settled people from Babylonia, Kutha, Ava, Hamath and Sfarvaim. The remaining people of the Ten Tribes mixed with the newly settled peoples and as a result of this union there developed in time the so-called Samaritans.
The Samaritans constituted a considerable population during the existence of the second Temple and for some time after its destruction. Later they assimilated with other Jewish sects to some extent, and the majority of them disappeared entirely.
Whenever the Samaritans are referred to in the Talmud or in the Midrashim, they are called Kuthim. The probable reason for this was that the people of Kutha constituted the most important element among the settlers whom the king of Assyria colonized in Samaria in place of the exiled Israelites. According to the Bible, these people did not observe the Jewish laws and did not believe in God during their first years in Samaria. As a punishment their dwellings were attacked by lions who killed many of them. The king of Assyria was then informed that the people whom he settled in the cities of Samaria in the place of the exiled Israelites did not know the laws of the God who rules there and, in his anger, God set upon them many lions to devour them. The king of Assyria thereupon commanded to have one of the exiled priests sent there to teach the people the laws of the God of Samaria.
One of the priests came and settled in Beth El and he taught the inhabitants to fear the God of Israel. From that time on the inhabitants continued to worship their old idols but they also erected an altar for the offering of sacrifices to the Jewish God. Since these people were converted to belief in the Jewish God because of their fear of the lions, they were called “Lions’ Converts”.
It is also necessary to keep in mind that in so far as the people of the Ten Tribes were descendants of the tribe of Ephraim, they harbored a deep seated hatred for the tribe of Judah, which dated back to the time of the Judges, when the people of Ephraim were warlike, loved to rule and constantly quarrelled with the other tribes. From the tribe of Ephraim descended Jeroboam who rebelled against king Solomon and at a later date detached the kingdom of Israel from the kingdom of the House of David.
133 years passed from the time of the exile of the Ten Tribes till the destruction of the first Temple. The land of Samaria underwent many changes during these years. Assyria ceased to exist and its nations came under the rule of another people. Even before the destruction of Samaria, there was a spiritual kinship between Jerusalem and Samaria, as is indicated by some of the prophets. We may also assume that this relationship between Jerusalem and Samaria continued to exist and was strengthened when the Samarians saw that the God of Judah saved Jerusalem from the Assyrians, a feat which their idols failed to accomplish.
It is probable that many Samarians went to Judea at that time and joined the kingdom of Judah. There are also indications that the king of Judah had some control over Samaria at certain times. Thus we read in Kings 2, 23 that king Josia destroyed the high places in Beth El and in the cities of Samaria. There also exists the possibility that only a small part of the Samarians denied the sacredness of Jerusalem even before the destruction of the first Temple. Thus it is told that after the death of Gedalia ben Achikam there came eighty men from Shechem, from Shiloh and from Samaria with offerings and incense in their hands to sacrifice in the Temple, for they did not know that it had been destroyed.
It is not quite clear what took place among the Samaritans during the 133 years from the exile of Samaria until the destruction of the first Temple, nor later, in the time of the Babylonian captivity. One thing we do know that when the Jews returned to Palestine from Babylonia under the reign of Cyrus, king of Persia, and the Samaritans heard that they were planning to build a new temple, they approached Zerubabel and the other leaders of the people and said: “We will gladly participate in your work, for we serve the same God that you do and to him we offer our sacrifices since the time of Esaradon, king of Assyria, who brought us here.”
The Samaritans are there called “the enemies of Judah and Benjamin,” which may serve as proof that the relations between the Samaritans and the Jews of that time were of a hostile nature. The Jews suspected evil intentions on the part of the Samaritans and refused their assistance. According to Josephus Flavius the Jews replied as follows: “Why should you help us when you will be able to use our Temple anyway, for our Temple will be a house of prayer for all nations.”
This refusal to accept the cooperation of the Samaritans revived the old feud between the tribe of Ephraim and the people of Judah. The Samaritans erected their own temple on Mount Gerizim. It is told that when Nehemia came to Jerusalem and found that the son of the High Priest Jojada ben Eliashiv was a son-in-law of Sanbalat the Horonite who hindered the building of the Temple through false reports to the Persian government, he expelled him from Jerusalem.
Josephus offers a somewhat different account. He relates that Manashe, the brother of the High Priest Jojada, married the daughter of Sanbalat the Samaritan. Nehemia commanded him to send away his wife even as he had everyone send away their non-Jewish wives. When Manashe refused to do so, he was driven out from among the Jews. He thereupon went to his father-in-law Sanbalat who built for him a temple on Mount Gerizim, where an altar had already existed for some time, to offer sacrifices, and he appointed him priest of the temple. Josephus continues to relate that many other men of Judea flocked to Samaria because they refused to send away their foreign wives and there they abolished the regulations of Ezra the Scribe. They did other things in order to sanctify Mount Gerizim and even falsified the text of the Torah as suited their purposes.
Ezra the Scribe regulated the form of the Hebrew script at that time. Historians differ as to the reasons for this. However we may safely assume that prior to this the Jews employed the old Phoenician script, which is now used by the Samaritans only, and not the square Assyrian alphabet which we have today. The broad masses of the people were illiterate and the Phoenician letters were difficult to learn. Another motive of Ezra in selecting the Assyrian script was to establish a dividing wall between the Jews and the Samaritans. This choice of an alphabet was approved and carried through by the Great Synagogue.
According to Josephus, Sanbalat built the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim with the consent of Alexander the Great. This consent was granted as a reward for the assistance which the Samaritans extended to him in his war against Tyre.
But according to the Talmud the Samaritan temple no longer existed in the days of Alexander the Great. However, there is an obvious contradiction in the Talmud legend which confuses two events which transpired at widely separated periods, namely, the journey of Simon the Just, together with other Jewish leaders, to meet Alexander the Great who intended to destroy Jerusalem and the destruction of the Samaritan temple by the High Priest Jochanan.
The Talmud relates: The twenty-fifth day of Tebeth is the day of Mount Gerizim on which no eulogies must be delivered. On this day the Kuthim (Samaritans) tried to obtain permission from Alexander the Great to destroy God’s house and he already granted this request. When the news was related to Simon the Just he put on his priestly vestments and taking the best men from among the Jews he put torches in their hands and thus they walked all night to meet the king.
They (the Jews) went on one side and the others (the Samaritans) on the other side until it began to dawn. When morning came and the king saw the Jews he asked his followers: “Who are these?” His people replied: “These are the Jews who revolted against you.” By this they meant to remind the king that the Jews refused to open the gates of Jerusalem for him before he conquered the Persians.
When they arrived in Antipatris the sun rose. As the king saw Simon the Just he descended from his carriage and bowed to him.
Then the king asked the Jews: “What is the purpose of your coming?”
To which they replied: “Is it possible that idol worshippers can persuade you to destroy a house in which prayers are offered for you and your kingdom?”
Who would have that done? the king asked.
These Kuthim who stand before you, the Jews replied.
I give them into your hands, the king answered to this.
The Jews seized the Kuthim and pierced the soles of their feet, they then tied them to their horses and dragged them over the thorns until they came to Mount Gerizim.
When they reached Mount Gerizim they plowed it and sowed it to lentils even as the Kuthim planned to do to the house of our God.
Later this day was set aside as a day of feasting.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא ס״ט א׳.</span></i>
With the construction of the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim near the city of Shechem, which is located in the very center of Palestine, Sanbalat hoped that it would soon become the religious center for all those for whom the road to Jerusalem was too long. In selecting Mount Gerizim he believed that he did the best thing possible because there God’s blessing was pronounced on those who follow his commandments.
In later years the priests of the temple on Mount Gerizim attempted to persuade the people that the Torah was handed down from Mount Gerizim and not from Mount Sinai as the Jews claimed. To lend strength to this contention, the text of the Torah was falsified. But this attempt did not succeed and the claim was afterward dropped.
From that time the struggle between the Jews and Samaritans gained in intensity. Often it was a struggle of ideas, each side claiming that the truth was on its side. On other occasions it took the form of bloody wars which lasted for centuries. The mutual hatred between the contending sides was so strong that even in times of relative peace it was considered a good deed to kill a member of the opposing side. Every time the Jews were attacked by enemies the Samaritans made common cause with these enemies, with two notable exceptions, the destruction of the second Temple and the siege of Betar.
How deeply rooted was the hatred between the Jews and Samaritans we can see best from the writings of Josephus, although he might have been prejudiced against them because in his time they fought on the side of the Jews against the Romans. But this hatred of the two peoples is also mentioned earlier in the books of the Maccabees and Ben Sira says of them that he is “disgusted with the shameful people who dwell in Shechem.”
When the Hasmoneans warred against the Greeks, Josephus relates, the Samaritans allied themselves with the enemies of the Jews and, at the time that religious Jews were tortured and persecuted by the Greeks, the Samaritans wrote to Antiochus Epiphanes: “We are not Jews and we do not recognize the Jewish God. If to this day we observed the Jewish Sabbath and other Jewish feast days, we did so not out of our own choice but through compulsion. If the king disapproves of our going in the ways of the Jews and our worshipping their God, we will return to the Gods of our forefathers and we will dedicate our temple to Zeus.”
After the victory of the Hasmoneans, the Samaritans joined with the nations about Palestine and sought to incite them to war against the Jews. Their hatred of the Jews was very great. It was for this reason that Jochanan Hyrcanos conducted against them a war of annihilation and destroyed their temple two hundred years after it was founded.
He was followed by his two sons who, although they fought amongst themselves, were united in their hatred of the Samaritans. When they conquered the city of Samaria, they leveled it with the ground and plowed up the site of the temple. The inhabitants fled the city to save their lives. Only much later, when Jerusalem was occupied by the Romans under Pompey, were the Samaritans returned to their dwellings.
The religious relations between the Jews and Samaritans varied with the times. Since the Samaritans resided among Jews for hundreds of years, legislation concerning them did not always follow the same system. At times they were considered as idol worshippers and it was told that their temple contained an image resembling a dove which they worshipped. On other occasions some of the Talmudic scholars maintained that the Samaritans should be considered Jews.
It was thus only natural that the Samaritans too should invent all kinds of stories about the Jews. Their main contention was that they were the real Jews and that only they observed all the commandments of the Torah. In order to prove that the Jews did not properly observe the laws of purity they did the following. On a certain Passover, when the Jews were gathered in Jerusalem, they placed the bones of a dead person among the wood which was kept near the altar in order to desecrate the Temple. But this action did not have the effect which the Samaritans anticipated. The scholars declared that after the bones were removed the Temple was pure again and argued that such dead bones do not have the power of profaning the Temple. Since no one knows where are the bones of the people that were drowned during the flood nor those of the victims of Nebuchadnezzar who destroyed the first Temple, it is entirely possible that some of those bones are interred near the Temple. Nevertheless, they said, no one would claim that the Temple is desecrated because of such bones.
At other times the Samaritans tried to spite the Jews. When the latter lit fires on the mountains to announce to far-away residents that a new month was beginning, the Samaritans sometimes put out these fires in order to cause erroneous celebration of the feast days.
At the time of the destruction of the second Temple, the Samaritans were the allies of the Jews in their struggle against the Romans. The Romans did not distinguish between Jews and Samaritans. The same was the case in the wars of Bar Kochba.
After the destruction of the second Temple the Samaritans remained in their city and their shrine continued to exist. Only about 150 years later they revolted against the Romans. The emperor Septimus Severus vanquished them, he destroyed the city of Samaria and killed its inhabitants. The same thing happened when the Romans warred against the Persians and the Samaritans helped the Persians.
The opinions of the Talmudic scholars concerning the Samaritans were not always the same. The great disputes occurred when both the Samaritan and the Jewish temples were in existence. Later the opinion prevailed that the Samaritans were true converts and according to Rabbi Simeon Ben Gamaliel a Samaritan was the equal of a Jew in every respect.
Sharply opposed to the Samaritans were the opinions of Rabbi Eliezer who said that “one who eats the bread of a Samaritan is like one who eats pork.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שביעית ח׳ י׳.</span></i> Other scholars were milder in their attitude and permitted partaking of Samaritan food.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי עבודה זרה פרק ה׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>

Simon the Just

T<small>HE FEW DECADES</small> which the Jews spent in Babylonia, from the exile of Jehoyachin king of Judea till their return under Cyrus king of Persia, deeply influenced their spiritual development in so far as the outward manifestations of the Jewish religion were concerned. It was from the Babylonians that they learned to identify angels by name. In all the books of the Bible preceding the book of Daniel, angels are referred to without names. According to the story of the Torah and the Prophets, angels were created by God’s wish to perform a definite mission. When that mission was completed, the angel would vanish without a name even as he appeared without a name.
Only after their return from the Babylonian captivity did the Jews begin to name the angels according to their function. Raphael became the angel of healing. Gabriel was the angel of strength and victory and Michael became the defender of the Jewish people.
In order to obtain a clearer understanding of the political situation we must remember that from the time of the return of the exiles till the breakdown of the Persian empire there prevailed comparative political stability. The Jews gathered internal strength and fortified the foundations of their religious and national life. But we have not received the name of any person of that period who could be said to have been the leader of the people.
The leadership was concentrated in the hands of the High Priest and of the group of people known as “Soferim”, scribes, who copied the holy writings. No unusual activity went on. The people stayed within their modest boundaries and diligently devoted themselves to the rebuilding of their homes and lands, seemingly indifferent to whom they paid their taxes or who ruled the land.
Only much later, in the days of Artaxerxes III (362-338 B. C.) did trouble begin when the Egyptians tried to liberate themselves from the yoke of the Persians. The Persian armies marched into Palestine on their way to Egypt. The Egyptians too did not wait until their land was invaded and proceeded to meet them. Both armies met in Palestine and there the battle was fought.
The Jews were thus forced to provide for both armies. Each of the contending sides tried to gain their support but they remained neutral in this conflict. The war ended with the withdrawal of Persia from Egypt, and Palestine became the apple of discord between the two powers each of whom desired to possess it for strategic reasons.
Meanwhile there set in a spiritual decline within the Persian nation. When the Persians conquered Babylonia and other Asiatic lands they found the inhabitants worshipping various gods of fertility and indulging in immorality as a form of piety. The Persian king Artaxerxes III introduced this type of worship into all the lands of his domain. The new form of worship strained the loyalty of the Jews towards the Persians because it ran contrary to all their concepts of religion. As the king devoted himself to the new cult he refrained from active participation in matters of state and entrusted the conduct of the government to his officials. One of these officials was put in charge of Jerusalem; another official, named Bagases, assassinated the king and his whole household and assumed the throne.
It was to this ruler that Joshua, the son of the High Priest Joyada, appealed to have himself appointed High Priest after the death of his father instead of his older brother Jochanan, who was the legitimate heir. When Joyada died, he attempted to claim his office and was killed within the Temple by his older brother. Upon hearing this the governor hastened to Jerusalem to avenge his friend but, having arrived, he did nothing to the murderer and utilized the opportunity to plunder the Temple. In addition he imposed upon the Jews a fine of fifty golden Drachmas to be paid daily and he entered the Holy of Holies which he stripped of all valuables.
Seven years later saw the beginning of the wars of Alexander the Great, king of Macedonia, in which he conquered all the domains of the Persians. Some of these battles were also fought on Palestine soil. The prophet Daniel described those wars as he foresaw them in his dream: "… The four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. And four great beasts, different one from another, came up out of the sea. The first was like a lioness and had the wings of an eagle; I beheld till her wings were plucked off and she was lifted up from the earth, and stood upon her feet as a man, and the heart of a man was given to her. And behold another beast like a bear stood up on one side and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth…. After this I beheld another like a tiger which had on its back four wings of a fowl and also four heads…. After this I saw in the night visions and behold a fourth beast dreadful and terrible and exceedingly strong and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped the residue with its feet.” (Daniel, 7.)
The High Priest at that time was Simon the Just who was a direct descendant of the High Priest Joshua, the first after the return from the Babylonian captivity. The personality of Simon the Just is veiled in legend and it is difficult to establish the exact years of his life. The generally accepted date of his death is about 310 B. C. Some historians claim he lived at a later date. But it is certain that he was the last of the Great Synagogue and that this institution was abolished in his time.
Of all the teachings of Simon the Just there remained but one statement which he must have repeated on numerous occasions. “Upon three things the world rests: upon the law, upon worship, and upon the showing of kindness.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אָבות פרק א׳ משנה ב׳.</span></i>
Simon the Just was High Priest for forty years according to the Talmud. These were years when Palestine went through terrible difficulties. As in the days of the first Temple, the country became the battlefield for many nations. These events became so commonplace that they were not even properly recorded. But the Jews of the surrounding countries (Babylonia, Persia, Egypt) lived under more favorable circumstances and they refrained from coming to Jerusalem. With the weakening of the atachment to Jerusalem, they strove to establish spiritual centers within the countries of their residence. One competing Temple, the temple of the Samaritans, already existed on Mount Gerizim. It had for its High Priest Menashe, the son-in-law of Sanbalat the Horonite, whom Nehemiah expelled from Jerusalem.
Many wonders are said to have occurred in the Temple in Jerusalem during the High Priesthood of Simon the Just. Some of these are described in the Talmud.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא ל״ט א׳.</span></i>
During the service of the Day of Atonement, two he goats were placed near the High Priest, one on his right and one on his left. Lots were cast to determine which one would be sacrificed as a sin offering and which one would be sent to Azazel in the desert, and each time the lot of being the sin offering fell to the goat on the right side of the priest.
The second wonder was the changing of the red string. A red string was tied around the neck of the goat being sent to Azazel. After the goat was thrown from the top of the precipice and it was cut to pieces in the fall, the red string which remained in the hands of the messenger turned white. This was a sign that the sins of the people were forgiven.
The third was the wonder of the burning western light. Since the Menorah in the Temple was situated between the North and South, its lamps were always lit from West to East. But in spite of the fact that the westernmost lamp was lit first it continued burning even when the oil in the other lamps was already consumed.
The fourth wonder was that of the altar fire. The fire on the altar increased of itself. Only two pieces of wood were added at sundown and the fire never went out.
Another wonder was that of the sheaf. A blessing rested on the sheaves which were given to the priests and on the holy loaves. Every priest received no more than the size of an olive and of that he ate his fill and left over.
Simon the Just did not approve of the Nazarites who vowed to abstain from wine and not to cut their hair for some time. As a protest against those Jews who indulged in extravagant living there appeared Nazarites who renounced all of these pleasures. Of these Simon the Just disapproved because he considered it a sin to renounce pleasures which God created for the benefit of people. He made only one exception to this rule and of this he tells himself:
There once came to me a man who had beautiful curly hair and he wanted to cut his hair because he ended the period of being a Nazarite. I asked him, “My son, what made you decide to cut off your beautiful hair?” And the man answered me, “I am a shepherd for my father. Once, when I went to the spring to draw water for the cattle, I looked at my image in the water and I was tempted to be proud of my beautiful appearance and thus to lose my life through sin. So I said to myself, ‘Wicked man, you are proud of something which is not yours, and you will, at any rate, turn to forms. I therefore swore to cut off this hair in honor of the Almighty.’”
Simon the Just kissed the Nazarite on the head and said to him: “May there be many like you in Israel.”
Two Red Heifers were sacrificed in the days of Simon the Just. The Red Heifer offering was the sacrifice of a cow which did not even have two black hairs. The animal also had to be without fault and must never have been put to work. Such an animal was therefore very rare and it was considered a miracle that two such were found during the forty years of his priesthood. In spite of the fact that sometimes as high a price as sixty measures of gold were paid for such an animal, there were only nine such sacrificed during the existence of both Temples. Legend has it that the tenth one will not be found until the coming of the Messiah.
Tradition has it that Alexander the Great wanted to destroy Jerusalem. He was then conducting a war against Syria and Phoenicia and he wanted the Jews of Palestine to help him. The Jews informed him that they cannot do so because they swore loyalty to king Darius the Mede. Hearing this Alexander announced to his soldiers that he would take revenge. When the Jews heard that Alexander was marching on Jerusalem with a great army they were stricken with fear. The High Priest Simon the Just together with all the priests and elders went to greet him.
Simon the Just was dressed in the priestly vestments that he used to wear when going into the Holy of Holies during the service on the Day of Atonement. As soon as Alexander saw him he descended from his chariot and bowed to him.
The commanders of his troops asked him what happened to make the conqueror of so many lands, who placed his foot on the necks of so many kings, bow before a Jew whom he previously threatened to destroy. Alexander answered that every night preceding a victory he saw an old man in his dream who resembled the Jewish High Priest. He therefore refused to do him any harm and believed that being kind to him would bring him luck in the coming wars.<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">According to Josephus, the name of this High Priest was Jaddua, but we will accept the opinion of the Talmud that it was Simon the Just, the grandson of Jaddua.</i>
Simon the Just then led Alexander into the Temple. Alexander liked the Temple and asked that a stone image of himself be placed near the altar. Simon the Just answered that this was impossible because the Jewish faith does not allow images in the Temple. But he promised to immortalize the memory of Alexander’s kindness in another manner. He had all the boys, who were born that year, named Alexander. The king liked this idea even better than having his statue near the altar.
The Samaritans then came before Alexander to complain against the Jews. They attempted to prove that their temple on Mount Gerizim was the true Jewish temple. Alexander asked them to debate the question with the Jews of Jerusalem in his presence. The spokesman of the Jews was one Gabiha ben Pasisa who, with his sensible arguments, destroyed the claims of the Samaritans. When Alexander acknowledged the Jews to be the victors of the debate, the Samaritans fled.
Numerous customs were introduced at that time which are still in force. Among them were the Kiddush and Havdalah, the blessings over wine on Friday eve and Saturday night and the regulation that even the poorest person must drink no less than four glasses of wine at the Seder on Passover eve. With the consent of the Great Court in Jerusalem the blessings over food were established. The reading of the Haftorah was introduced for Saturdays and feast days. Since the Samaritans did not acknowledge the sanctity of the Prophets an appropriate chapter from the Prophets was selected to be read each week.
The Temple in Jerusalem was already in existence about two hundred years and naturally the structure was becoming weakened. Simon the Just had the building repaired and had verandas built around it. Jerusalem suffered a shortage of water and much water was also required for the Temple service. The priests had to perform ablutions several times a day and even an ordinary person had to bathe before entering the precincts of the Temple. Simon the Just dug a well under the ground near the Temple from which an aqueduct was later built to bring sufficient water to the city through copper pipes.
Immediately after the Day of Atonement of the year in which he died, Simon the Just announced that he would die. When he was asked how he knew this, he said that on every Day of Atonement, when he entered the Holy of Holies to perform the service, he saw an old man dressed in white who used to leave the Holy of Holies together with him. That year the old man was dressed in black and did not leave the Holy of Holies with him. It happened just as he predicted. Seven days after Succoth he became ill and died.
Simon the Just was survived by two sons, Shimei and Onias, of whom Onias was the wiser and more capable. Simon the Just wanted Onias to succeed him to the High Priesthood. But Shimei intrigued among the people against the will of his father and caused them to believe that a man such as Simon the Just would not want his younger son to take precedence over the older. Disappointed, Onias left for Alexandria in Egypt where there existed a large Jewish community of over a million people. There he established a competing temple (the house of Onias) with an altar for the offering of sacrifices to the God of Israel even as the Samaritans had their Temple on Mount Gerizim.

Antigonos of Socho

Simon the Just was the last of the generation which considered that knowledge of the Torah and its interpretations was the exclusive privilege of the priests. He had numerous disciples among whom were many non-priests. Antigonos of Socho was one of the latter and he came to occupy the position of Simon the Just in the continuation of scholastic development.
There is even some doubt as to whether Antigonos was the direct successor of Simon the Just or whether he lived some generations later. But since history does not mention any intermediate personality between the two, we can rely on the Mishnah<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אָבות פרק א׳ משנה ג׳.</span></i> that Antigonos received his knowledge directly from Simon the Just.
The name Antigonos, which is Greek, is characteristic of the time. We already described how the name Alexander came to be accepted among Jews and it is possible that the name Antigonos was popularized in a similar manner. One of the Greek governors of Palestine, Antigonos by name, showed kindness to the Jews and out of gratitude to him they decided to immortalize his name. However, it is more logical to assume that the Hellenist movement which sought to bring the Jews closer to Greek customs was already in vogue at that time, for we find many Greek names in popular use such as Antigonos, Aristobul, Boetus and others. Even the “Great Court” in Jerusalem was known by the Greek name “Synhedrion” and this name was later sanctified through popular use. During the time of Antigonos there developed a crisis in Jewish thought; it is probable that the spirit of philosophic doubt became prevalent in the country and, against his will, Antigonos contributed to its spread.
He frequently used to say: When you serve God, be not like servants who serve the master with the expectation of receiving gifts but rather be like servants who serve the master without expecting gifts and the fear of Heaven will be upon you. Two of his pupils, Zadok and Boetus, who heard his words said: What can be the meaning of these words? Can a person expect that his servant work for him all day without receiving compensation? We must conclude that our teacher would not say so if he believed in a life to come and the resurrection of the dead.
Zadok and Boetus thereupon founded a new mode of living and organized a new party which came to be known as Sadducees or Boetusians. This party began to imitate the extravagant mode of living of the Greeks under the following pretext: Why should a person deny himself the pleasures of life if he can await nothing after death? In time this party evolved new forms of observing Judaism which were different from those of the majority of the people, they clung to the literal meaning of the commandments of the Torah as against the traditions of the scholars. For that reason they denied the resurrection of the dead and also the theory of compensation and punishment in a life to come. They ridiculed the belief of the masses that a new redemption would be brought by a Messiah since the conditions then prevailing could not be the culmination of the dreams of the prophets.
Jews very particularly observed all regulations pertaining to the “uncleanliness of the dead.” Upon dying a person ceased to exist for his family and friends and the body was given over to strangers for burial. The Sadducees considered this procedure disrespectful toward one’s parents since one could not be sure what was done with the bodies. In rejecting the traditions they insisted that the commandment “an eye for an eye” should be interpreted literally and not, as the Talmudic scholars claimed, that monetary compensation was sufficient.
Antigonos lived in a time of constant wars between the kings of Egypt and Syria. Palestine was frequently the battle-ground of the warring armies and it was impossible to maintain order and to assure the security of life. Plunderers invaded the land from outside and when these left, the population was further impoverished by domestic banditry. Learning was on the decline. In a time of changes it was necessary to modify the Torah to adapt it to the needs of the day, but there was no one capable of doing this. As a result of this the people neglected their studies and Judaism was being forgotten. For nearly a hundred years the people lived in ignorance and spiritual poverty until the historical circumstances changed when the throne of Syria was occupied by a king who interfered with the religious life of the Jews and undertook to destroy the entire Jewish religion
Alexander the Great followed the principle of religious tolerance toward the peoples of his empire. This principle was adhered to by his followers. Any deviation from the religious observances on the part of the Jews occurred as a result of their own neglect. This condition lasted until Antiochus Epiphanes of Syria attempted to impose his religion on all the peoples of his kingdom. Among the Jews this attempt led to the revolt of the Hasmoneans which started a new epoch in Jewish history.
The belief that God protects the Jewish nation and will punish their enemies was deeply rooted among the people. They believed that the historical events chronicled in the Torah were not related just as historical events but that their aim was to teach the people to understand the rules according to which the world was being governed This was held to be the intention of Moses in describing the war with Amalek so that coming generations may know how to deal with the Amalekites who warred against the Jews in their wanderings in the desert after their first liberation.
Considerable attention was also given to the Hebrew language. Upon returning from Babylonia the people spoke a mixture of the neighboring languages together with Hebrew. Later the Syrian Greek language predominated. The court of the Hasmoneans then commanded that Hebrew should be employed as the spoken language. This ancient language had lost some of the power of its expression, but it developed again until it could be used to express all concepts.
In the development of the Hebrew language, both Aramaic and Greek were borrowed from extensively for certain new expressions.

Jose ben Joeser and Jose ben Jochanan

A<small>FTER</small> A<small>NTIGONOS OF</small> S<small>OCHO</small> there began a period in Jewish history which was characterised by dual leadership. This period lasted for about five generations and was called the time of the “Pairs” because two men simultaneously led and governed the people. One of the two was generally the Nasi (Chief) and the other was called, the “Av Beth Din,” the father of the court.
At first these “Pairs” were in complete agreement on all fundamental issues and differed only on minor religious questions. Later these disagreements increased and reached the point of severe disputes which engendered dangerous bitterness.
In all there were five such “pairs”: 1) Jose b. Joezer of Zereda and Jose b. Jochanan of Jerusalem; 2) Joshua b. Perachia and Nittai of Arbella; 3) Jehuda b. Tabai and Simeon b. Shetach; 4) Shemaia and Avtalion; 5) Hillel and Shammai. The reverence with which the teachings of these leaders were considered is illustrated by the statement of one of their followers, Nachum Halavlar (the Scribe): “I received a tradition from Rabbi Miasha, who received it from his father, who heard it from the “Pairs” who received it from the Prophets as a law handed down to Moses from Mount Sinai.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּאה פרק ב׳ משנה י׳.</span></i> This saying indicates the mood of the people who believed that every word of the “Pairs” was a law handed down to Moses from Mount Sinai.
The first “pair” lived in the days of the High Priest Alkimos who allied himself with the Greeks against the Jews under the reign of Demetrius Soter (about 300 B. C.). This High Priest met with considerable opposition from the pious elements who objected to his treacherous actions and attempted to lead the people along the true paths.
Jewish history has known such dual leadership even before the time of Jose b. Joezer and Jose b. Jochanan. Thus we find Jehoshaphat the fourth king of Judea after Solomon, appointing two leaders to conduct the government. One, the priest Amariah, was the authority of the Word of God and the other, Zachariah b. Ishmael, was the lord of the commands of the king. After the return from the Babylonian captivity we find Zerubabel the secular leader and Jeshua b. Jozadak as High Priest. Still later the government was shared by Ezra and Nehemia. But in spite of this condition of dual leadership and the rarity of two leaders cooperating amicably, there arose no disputes among the first “Pair” except in the matter of one ritual question on which Jose b. Joezer and Jose b. Jochanan could not agree. This question was also disputed by the later “pairs.” It involved the problem of placing one’s hands on a sacrifice on a feast day.
The Bible enjoined a person to “place his hand” on the sacrifice which he brought and this was interpreted to mean that he was to assist in the slaughtering of the animal. Since this procedure involved a considerable effort it was held by some that a person should not do so on the Sabbath or on a feast day. Others maintained that the restrictions of the Sabbath are not operative in the Temple and the individual must therefore assist in the slaughtering of the sacrifice if it is to be offered according to the law.
The procedure of the “placing of hands” was as follows. The animal to be sacrificed was placed on the North side of the slaughter house and faced to the West. The person bringing the offering stood on the East facing the West. Then he placed his hands between the horns of the animal and confessed the sins for the atonement of which he brought the sacrifice. Those who prohibited this procedure of placing of hands on a feast day believed that it involved an effort and was therefore unnecessary; the others considered the whole procedure and the confession as sanctifying the sacrifice and permitted this effort in the Temple.
The problem of the Jews living outside of Palestine who sent their sacrifices to Jerusalem was of paramount importance in the discussion of this question. The decision involved the acceptance of the sacrifice without the presence of the penitent or a demand that the penitent must be present during the offering of the sacrifice. Those who permitted the offering of a sacrifice on a feast day without the presence of the owner feared that any undue severity might tend to encourage those Jews living outside of Palestine to erect altars wherever they live and thus to compete with the Temple in Jerusalem; they feared that it might even lead to idolatry. Those who opposed this leniency were motivated by opposition to the Sadducees who tried to make the regulations of conduct on the Sabbath or a feast day so severe as to be impossible of observance.
Two other decrees were introduced by Jose b. Joezer and Jose b. Jochanan. They declared all countries surrounding Palestine as impure where no Jew may live. One who does live in any of these lands must perform numerous ablutions and rites of purification before he may enter Palestine. In issuing this decree it was apparently aimed to limit the dispersion of the Jews among the neighboring nations, which was assuming large proportions due to the persecutions of the Greek government. This decree caused great hardships to those who refused to submit to the laws of the Palestine administration which attempted to eradicate Judaism. The second decree promulgated by them declared all glass vessels which were made by non Jews to be impure even as earthen dishes were.
In passing it is worth mentioning that both of these decrees were done away with in time. Even observing Jews settled in Gentile lands in later years and glass vessels were considered pure after being rinsed in water. Jose b. Joezer also introduced three rules which lightened the burden of the laws. During years of famine, when the people could not identify the four types of locust which the Bible permits to be used as food, he gave his sanction to the use of a locust which invaded the country from Babylonia. He permitted the people to use the water and the blood from the sacrificial slaughter house for household purposes and as garden fertilizer. He also declared that only the person who comes in direct contact with a dead body or an impure object is impure but such a person does not convey the impurity to other people. This declaration was of special significance due to the preparations which were then going on for a rebellion against the Greeks who persecuted the Jewish faith. Many were reluctant to go to war out of fear of becoming contaminated through contact with people that touched dead bodies. It was for this reason that Jose b. Joezer announced that only the first person touching a dead body is impure.
Jose b. Joezer is credited with the following moral saying: “Let thy house be a place of meeting for the wise and dust thyself with the dust of their feet and drink their words with thirst.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אָבות פרק א׳ משנה ד׳.</span></i> These words were directed against the government which aimed to separate the people from their teachers; anyone who converted his home into a place of instruction risked his very life if he was caught.
Of Jose b. Jochanan’s life we know but little. Of his teachings there remained the following saying: “Let thy house be opened wide and let the poor be like thy household and talk not much with a woman, not even with thy own wife.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אָבות פרק א׳ משנה ה׳.</span></i>
This statement too was aimed against the attempts of the government to introduce the morals of the Greeks and their lack of hospitality toward strangers and the poor. Since the Greeks worshipped goddesses Jose b. Jochanan feared that people might come to deify woman through sexual motives and he therefore sought to keep the sexes apart.
Jose b. Joezer was referred to as the “zealot of the priesthood.” The death of both Joses marked the end of the Encyclopedists who directed the nation in all spheres of life. The Talmud also states that from the death of Moses till the death of Jose b. Joezer the pursuit of study was at the same height as during the lifetime of Moses.
How Jose b. Jochanan died we know nothing but that Jose b. Joezer died at the hands of Greek soldiers. He was condemned to be crucified because of his anti government activities and his last words testify to his noble spirit and to the strength of his faith.
The High Priest Alkimos was related to Jose b. Joezer. In his endeavor to gain the favor of the rulers, Alkimos ordered the destruction of all pious Jews who refused to submit to the Greek religion. At his behest, sixty Jews were caught and sentenced to death; among them was Jose b. Joezer. As they were being led to execution, the High Priest Alkimos again tried to persuade his relative to submit to the government and save his life.
The following conversation between them was handed down through the generations.
Look, said the High Priest, at the wealth and great honor which I possess because I obey the orders of the government and also observe the misfortune which you have brought upon yourself that you have to die the death of a criminal.
To this Jose quietly replied; If those who anger God live as well as you do, you can readily imagine how good will be the share of those who do his will.
Alkimos further said: Can you show me another person who obeyed God’s will more than you did?
To which Jose replied: If those who do God’s will end as I do, what a terrible end must await those who anger him with their evil deeds.
These words made a deep impression on the High Priest and, according to the Midrash (Breshit Raba) he thereupon committed suicide. Others claim that he died from a stroke. (Josephus, Macabees).
Jose b. Joezer and Jose b. Jochanan were designated as “Ashkoloth,” (literally: clusters) because they united many virtues within themselves. Great as their scholarship was, they also excelled in their moral behavior. When they passed away the people mourned that with their death all virtue departed.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי סוטה פרק ט׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>
It is also related that Jose b. Joezer had a son who was not capable and did not follow in the footsteps of his father. Jose therefore gave all his possessions for communal purposes.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא קל״ג ב׳.</span></i>
It was a time of unrest and wars between the kings of Egypt and Syria and Palestine was the battleground of the contending armies. In this turmoil little attention was paid by the people to learning and ignorance prevailed. The general tendency was to imitate the customs of the Gentiles, and the idea was current that Jews should assimilate with the ruling Greek nation. Among the first Greek customs to become popular were athletics and public tournaments. Many Jews were persuaded that their national welfare would be enhanced by training in the various sports and gladiatorial excercises. There might have been but little objection to these sports in themselves were it not for the Greek habit of engaging in these sports while altogether nude. It happened that when Jewish young men engaged in these exercises, they were ashamed of being circumcised and in various artificial manners tried to graft foreskins so as not to be recognized as Jews.
In time such manifestations of assimilation became secondary, and, as the party of the “Friends of the Greeks” expanded through the adherence of the richer elements of the population, they attempted to modify the service in the Temple to resemble more nearly the form of worship of the Greek temples.
Pious Jews considered such deeds as the peak of immorality and they rallied in a group which came to be known as “Assembly of the pious” or “Congregation of the just” in order to separate themselves still further from those friendly to the Greeks whom they considered to be Jews no longer.
There thus developed a great hatred between the two contending parties. The friends of the Greeks were denounced as “traitors to the covenant”, “dregs of the people” and “profaners of the holy covenant.” The assimilationist elements considered the pious people to be fools who observe strange ceremonies which hinder a closer understanding between Jews and Greeks, and before very long, the friends of the Greeks called on the government to come to their assistance in their struggle against the pious Jews.

Jochanan the High Priest

D<small>AYS OF TERROR AND TRIBULATION</small> beset the Jewish faith. Jerusalem was occupied by Syrian-Greek troops, in the Temple was installed the image of Zeus and swine were offered on the holy altar of the God of Israel. There was also no lack of Jewish traitors who assisted the enemy in his work and it seemed that the last hour had struck for the Jewish religion. Pious Jews sought safety in the mountains and caves of Judea, hidden from the eyes of strangers. There they observed the laws of Judaism and avoided desecrating the Sabbath; there too they inducted the new born children into the Jewish faith.
In the town Modiim, not far from Ludd, there gathered a group of the faithful. One of the priests, Mattathias ben Jochanan of the Hasmonean family, who could trace his descent from the priest Jojariv, erected an altar to the God of Israel. When the representative of the government heard of this he sent an officer with a detachment of soldiers to investigate the situation. The Greek officer called Mattathias and commanded him to sacrifice a pig on the altar. To this Mattathias replied: “Were all the people of the king’s domains to worship your god and were all the Jews to join them in this worship, I and my sons would still not deviate from the ways of my forefathers and I will not serve any other God but the only living God in Heaven.”
Then one of the Jews approached the altar to fulfill the command of the officer. Mattathias thereupon stabbed him with a knife and killed him. As the Greek officer tried to attack Mattathias, he and his soldiers were set upon by the surrounding people and were slaughtered.
Every one realized that this act of rebellion would be followed by the revenge of the government and that they were facing a choice between struggle and annihilation. This deed of Mattathias therefore acted as a call to battle and a long and bitter war ensued. The Greeks could bring onto the field of battle many more well equipped soldiers than the Jews could. The Jews therefore feared to face them in open battle and conducted a guerilla form of warfare. Judas Macabbee, the son of Mattathias, fell in one of these battles and he was succeeded by his brother Jochanan who led the Jewish forces to victory in several engagements. With the consent of the king, Jochanan assumed the high priesthood which he held for but a short time until he was betrayed to the enemy and killed. Simeon, the youngest son of Mattathias, then assumed the leadership of the people and also successfully completed the war of liberation.
The religious leadership of the nation then rested not in the hands of individuals or of a “pair” but was vested in a Beth Din (a court of at least five people and sometimes more). This body came to be known in the Talmud as “The Court of the Hasmoneans” but history does not record the names of any of the members of this court.
It is probable that this court did not come into existence before the rule of Jonathan, son of Mattathias. When Jonathan sent letters to the Lacedemonians to renew the alliance against the Syrians, we find these letters signed by men of the “Great Council.” When Simeon became Nasi, we read that this position was given to him by the “Elders” and the “Heads of the people.” These men apparently were the members of the “Court of the Hasmoneans.”
This court worked to erect an impenetrable wall between the Jews and the non Jews. All the previous laws of the Torah pertaining to relations with other peoples were interpreted in the severest possible manner. They also instituted difficult regulations in all matters pertaining to uncleanness; all of these decrees later came to be known as the laws of the Hasmonean court.
It was this court which established an annual feast of eight days to commemorate the miracles which transpired during the war with the Greeks. This feast came to be called “Chanukah,” dedication, because it was originally celebrated to rededicate the altar which the Greeks profaned with unclean sacrifices. Although many feast days to commemorate various triumphs of the Macabbees were in vogue at that time, only Chanukah with its lights and singing of praise continued to be celebrated throughout the years and was sanctioned by the Hasmonean court.
In addition to the new regulations, the ultra pious voluntarily assumed many other restrictions. Prayers which were introduced by the Great Synagogue were already in common use but before beginning to recite them it became customary to devote a few minutes to spiritual communion with “the father in heaven.” This spiritual communion they would not interrupt under any circumstances were even a king to drive by or were a snake to wind itself about the foot of the suppliant. Disregarding all perils, the ultra pious were ready to face any danger if only it would enable them to observe the laws of the Torah. The observance of the Sabbath was held in special esteem so that even the killing of a poisonous snake on that day was considered to be sinful. At first they even refused to fight their enemies on the Sabbath and history records one case during the lifetime of Mattathias when one thousand Jews were burned to death in a cave to which the Greek soldiers set fire because they did not want to desecrate the Sabbath by putting out the fire. After this occurrence Mattathias instructed all his followers to desecrate the Sabbath if necessary when fighting the enemy.
But the observance of the Sabbath was not the only law which they obeyed in its minutest details. They cleared the roads used by travelers of all thorns, glass and other hindrances lest some person stumble and be injured due to another’s negligence. These they buried deep in the ground so that not even a ploughshare might turn them up.
After the triumph of the Hasmoneans the people felt free and joyous and on feast days they all gathered together, both those who previously sinned as well as those who never departed from the faith, and joined in a common chorus. The past sinners would begin their song with the words, “Praised be he who never sinned” and the chorus responded “He who sinned shall be forgiven.” Then those who felt free of wrong doing intoned, “Praised be my youth which did not bring shame on my old age” and the sinners of the past joined with, “Praised be my old age which atones for the transgressions of my youth.”
The court of the Hasmoneans was systematically strict in the enforcement of those laws which did not cause any losses to the people but practiced leniency where the legislation was becoming intolerably severe as in the cases of the Nazarites and of the Passover offering. These lenient or strict interpretations were based on new studies of the text of the Bible to every letter of which great significance was being ascribed. The scholars of that time also began to ponder the events of Jewish history and attempted to explain the causes of the great suffering which Jews had to endure. They came to the conclusion that all injury inflicted on the Jews invariably is avenged on the evil doers. Thus Amalek tried to destroy them and he was wiped off the face of the earth. Pharaoh enslaved the Jews and caused their children to be cast into the river so the Egyptians were drowned in the sea. This, they reasoned, must be the fate of every nation which does harm to the Jews; to be repaid with the same measure.
Simeon, the son of Mattathias the Hasmonean, was assassinated in a treacherous fashion by his son in law Ptolemy ben Chabub who occupied the post of tax collector in the district of Shechem. Feeling secure after his triumph over the Greeks, Simeon frequently accepted the invitations of his son in law to visit him together with his family. It was on one of these visits that he was murdered by Ptolemy who was secretly negotiating with the Greek rulers to have himself appointed governor of the country after the death of Simeon. But Ptolemy’s hopes proved to be vain. The king of Syria did not fulfill his promise and Simeon’s son Jochanan succeeded his father. Jochanan united within himself both the religious and the secular authority over the people as prince and High Priest.
Historically Jochanan is known as John Hyrcanus or Hyrcanus the first to distinguish him from king Hyrcanus II who was the grandfather of queen Miriam the Hasmonean. In the Talmud he is called Jochanan the High Priest. The surname Hyrcanus he obtained from his conquest of the fortress Hyrcania.
After Ptolemy murdered Jochanan’s father he held his mother as hostage for fear of reprisals from Jochanan. When Jochanan stormed Ptolemy’s fortress and it seemed that it might fall, Ptolemy led his mother in law to the wall of the castle and there he tortured her in sight of her son. Jochanan was ready to withdraw in order to spare his mother any more suffering but she exhorted him in the name of his father not to be affected by her injuries and to exert every effort to take the fortress. But the stronghold was well fortified and he could not conquer it. Seeking for an excuse to retreat without shame, Jochanan declared that the new year, which was just then beginning, was a sabbatical year during which no wars might be waged. Ptolemy murdered his mother in law and fled after which he was never heard of again.
Shortly after this event Jochanan was again involved in war with the Greeks who, under their new king Antiochus Sedetis, attempted to regain control of the country. They advanced on Jerusalem with a great army but they could not take it. The power of the Greeks was broken and they feared the intervention of Rome which was bound by treaty to assist the Jews. After much fighting a new peace was declared according to which the Jews had to pay 500 measures of silver and to deliver a number of young men from the noble families as hostages. In time the relations with the Syrian Greek kingdom improved to such an extent that Jochanan even sent military assistance to their king in his wars against the Parthians.
Jochanan was engaged in many protracted wars until he finally succeeded in completely freeing his country. With the aid of gold treasures which he found in the tombs of the kings of Judea he hired a mercenary army and marched on the Idumeans. To them he offered the choice of accepting the Jewish faith or being exiled. The Idumeans preferred to accept the Jewish religion rather than be driven out of their homes. Jochanan then attacked Samaria which he destroyed together with the Samaritan temple which was the greatest hindrance to the existence of the Temple in Jerusalem.
As a result of these conquests it became necessary to introduce new regulations which should fit the newly created conditions. Among the conquered cities there were some which were previously a part of Syria and as such were considered unclean where no Jew might live. These cities were now considered a part of Palestine and were subject to all the laws pertaining to tithes, the sabbatical year, the bringing of the first fruits, the pilgrimage to Jerusalem and the offering of sacrifices. The rule was established that if one buys a field in Syria it is as if he bought a field in a suburb of Jerusalem, and all the newly conquered cities which could be reached without passing through foreign territory were considered to be the equals of the holy Palestine towns. In this manner Jochanan extended the boundaries of Palestine to include Syria in the possession of the Jews even as he did with the cities of Idumea.
Some of the regulations relating to the bond of Syria with Palestine were changed at a later date; it also soon became evident that the Idumeans who were converted by force did not add to the well being of the Jewish people. But the sincerity of the intentions of Jochanan was appreciated by all and even though, in later years, he came in conflict with the scholars, the Talmud nevertheless credits him for his good intentions.
Other religious innovations were directed against the Samaritans (Kuthim) who mingled with the other Jews after the destruction of their temple but in their hearts still bore a great hatred toward them. This hatred caused uneasiness and the Samaritans were mistrusted; their adherence to the Jewish people was questioned even though they seemed to observe some customs even more strictly than did the Jews. It was then forbidden to partake of the food of a Samaritan and eating of the bread of a Samaritan was considered to be the same as eating pork.
Among his other innovations, the High Priest Jochanan also did away with reciting the dedication which was prescribed for all men who brought the tithe. He sent out messengers throughout the cities of Palestine to see whether the tithes were properly contributed. These messengers reported to him that the Palestine farmers gave only the “Large tithe,” the exact amount of which was never established; they therefore offered only between two and three percent. When Jochanan heard this he ordered that whoever bought grain or fruit from a farmer (Am Haaretz) should not ask whether the tithes were already given from that produce and he was obliged to offer the necessary amount even though the seller assured him that the tithes were already given. It was for this reason that he abolished the confession during the offering of tithes; out of fear that a falsehood might be uttered before God if a person should say that he gave the proper tithes.
The difficulties with the giving of tithes began during the days of Ezra. Since not all the Levites wanted to return to Palestine from Babylonia, Ezra fined those who refused to return by taking away their rights to the tithe. It thus became impossible to include the words “and I gave it to the Levite” which are contained in the Biblical text of the confession of the tithes. Others thought that since the tithes were frequently collected by force it would not be true to confess that the tithes were “given.” The High Priest Jochanan also realized that the conditions affecting the tithes changed radically. During the days of the first Temple, Palestine was divided among the tribes and the Levites did not possess any lands; they were thus entitled to the tithes. But in his time conditions were different and the tithes weighed heavily on the farmers who had to pay taxes in addition to the three different kinds of tithes (first tithe, second tithe, tithe for the poor). Realizing the injustice of this condition and being powerless to abolish the commandment of the Torah, he introduced a new system. He appointed overseers to watch that the farmers obey the law and to take the tithes by force if necessary. But when a person bought produce from a farmer he did not have to inquire whether tithes were given but had to consider his purchase as “Dmai”, doubtful produce, from which the buyer had to give the tithes.
Until the time of Jochanan it was customary to work in Jerusalem in the period intervening between the first and last day of a holiday and the pounding of hammers was heard throughout the city. Jochanan considered this a profanation of the holy city and he forbade it. When in later years it was altogether forbidden to work with hammers in Jerusalem the new regulation was based on Jochanan’s ordinance.
He also did away with the singing of Psalm 48 by the Levites during the service. Verse 24 of this Psalm reads “Awake, why do you slumber Lord.” It came to be chanted at a time when the Jews were sorely pressed on all sides while the other nations lived in peace. But Jochanan held that it is disrespectful to ask God to awake from slumber. He also changed the procedure of offering sacrifices. Previously it was customary to make an incision between the horns of the animal to be slaughtered with a sharp knife in order that the blood might blind it and make it easier to bind. Jochanan said that this practice was equivalent to crippling the sacrifice as the cut might pierce the animal’s brain and thus make it unfit for sacrifice. He ordered that a ring be made to be placed on the neck of the animal and thus facilitate its binding.
In the observance of the commandments of the Torah, Jochanan always sided with the Pharisees. But once, during the closing years of his life the Pharisees incurred his anger and he forsook them to take the part of the Sadducees. It happened during a feast which he gave after one of his victories, that, flushed with wine he challenged the assembled to mention any evil which they knew of him. One of the guests, Eleazar ben Poirah, whom the Talmud calls “a wicked and hard hearted scoffer,” said to Jochanan: “The Pharisees are displeased with you.” When Jochanan inquired for the cause of the displeasure, there rose an old man Jehudah ben Gadidiah and said: “Enough that you have the crown of royalty; leave the crown of the priesthood for a pious descendant of Aaron for you are the son of a woman who was held in captivity.” (He was referring to the fact that Jochanan’s mother was held captive among the Gentiles which may have cast some doubt on his parentage.) Very much concerned, Jochanan had the whole matter investigated and when the statement was not substantiated Jehuda ben Gadidia was tried by the Sanhedrin and sentenced to be flogged.
But Jochanan was not satisfied with this punishment and the Sadducees further incited him to believe that all the Pharisees thought as Jehuda ben Gadidia did. As Jochanan tried to justify the verdict of the Sanhedrin on the ground that the Torah commands that a slanderer be flogged, the above mentioned Eleazar ben Poirah said: “True this is the law for one who slanders an ordinary person, but in this case where a king and High Priest was slandered, the Sanhedrin should have acted differently.”
Jochanan allowed himself to be persuaded. He removed all the Pharisees from the Sanhedrin and filled their places with Sadducees. The new Sanhedrin immediately tried Jehuda ben Gadidia a second time and condemned him to death together with a number of other Pharisees. From that time Jochanan remained an adherent of the Sadducees.<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">This version of the manner in which Jochanan forsook the Pharisees to join the Sadducees is told by Josephus. In the Talmud it is stated that it happened during the reign of king Jannai. However, the reference could not be to Alexander Jannai, the son of Jochanan Hyrcanus, for on another occasion the Talmud states “Jannai and Jochanan are the same person.”</i>

Joshua ben Perachia and Nittai of Arbela

The period of the spiritual activity of the High Priest Jochanan also marked the rise of another “pair” of spiritual leaders. Sympathizing then with the Pharisees, Jochanan recognized the necessity of bringing to the forefront of religious life the two most outstanding scholars, one of whom was to occupy the post of Nasi of the Sanhedrin and the other was to be head of the Supreme Court, even as in the days of Jose b. Joezer and Jose b. Jochanan. He accordingly appointed Joshua ben Perachia Nasi and Nittai of Arbela head of the Supreme Court.
Whatever innovations were introduced by these scholars were credited to Jochanan because, as political and religious leader of the nation, he had sufficient authority to enforce them. But when Jochanan transferred his allegiance to the Sadducees after the Sanhedrin sentenced Jehuda b. Gadidia only to be flogged for slandering him, he removed all the Pharisees from the Sanhedrin and abolished all their legislation. Joshua b. Perachia feared to remain in the country and fled to Egypt where, it may be assumed, he was joined by Nittai of Arbela.
Out of Egypt Joshua b. Perachia wrote to the Jews of Palestine that the wheat shipped from Alexandria should be considered unclean because he believed it was being contaminated by unclean hands in the process of irrigation and fertilization which was being practiced in Egypt. This restriction was based on the text of the Torah (Leviticus, 11). Others explained his prohibition of the use of Alexandrian wheat on the grounds that by using irrigation and other artificial methods to encourage the plant growth, human beings interfere with the natural laws and attempt to improve the natural course of development as it was ordained by God.
But the leaders in Jerusalem refused to abide by this prohibition of Joshua b. Perachia and said that even though he might consider it unclean all other Jews might consider it fit for consumption.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספתא מכשירין פרק ג׳.</span></i>
It is regrettable that no mention is made of the relation of Joshua b. Perachia to the temple of Onias in Alexandria. It is possible that he did not openly condemn the temple of Onias because it was held in great reverence by the Jews of Egypt, but secretly he must have been opposed to it. He was too deeply attached to Jerusalem and to its temple to reconcile himself to the idea that Jews can have another temple outside of Jerusalem. He therefore tried to create the impression that whatever comes out of Egypt is impure, both the grain that was shipped out as well as the sacrifices that were offered there.
The manner in which Onias, the son of Simeon the Just, left Jerusalem and erected the “temple of Onias” to compete with the temple in Jerusalem was related in a previous chapter. It is characteristic that the scholars had no definit attitude toward this temple. They were convinced that it was built for sacred purposes and therefore stated that “the temple of Onias is not a house of idolatry.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה י׳ א׳.</span></i>
But in spite of the official sanction which they gave to this temple they never wholeheartedly approved of it. The priests of the temple of Onias they held on a level with priests of Bamoth (high places built for purposes of offering sacrifices) which were built for sacred and not for idolatrous purposes. This type of Bamah was also forbidden during the time that the temple existed, but a Bamah which was erected by an individual for sacred purposes was permitted. They therefore looked upon the temple of Onias as a private Bamah built for sacred purposes.
The Mishna established a rule that whoever vowed to bring a burnt offering in the temple of Onias must offer this sacrifice in the temple in Jerusalem, but if the person sacrificed the burnt offering in the temple of Onias he has fulfilled his vow. Josephus relates that during the civil war between the princes Hyrcanus and Aristobulus, when the Jews of the various cities of Palestine could not go to Jerusalem to sacrifice the Paschal lamb, they went to the temple of Onias to bring this offering.
It is interesting to note the contradictions which characterize Josephus’ writings of the temple of Onias. On one occasion he states that when Onias built this temple he persuaded the king of Egypt that a temple located in Egypt would serve to keep alive the hatred of the Jews toward Antiochus and would arouse their revenge against Antiochus for having destroyed the temple in Jerusalem. Several pages further Josephus maintains that by building this temple Onias sought to avenge himself for the wrong which he considered was done by the Jews of Jerusalem.
Of the teachings of Joshua b. Perachia there has come down to us one noble maxim: Make thee a teacher and win thee a friend and judge every man favorably.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אָבות פרק א׳ משנה ו׳.</span></i>
The political and social conditions in Palestine were such that if a person wanted to remain true to the traditions of his people he needed a teacher and a guide whom he might imitate; he needed a friend to correct any error in his ways. Joshua b. Perachia especially believed in judging people fairly. Even though he was forced to flee Jerusalem and to seek refuge in Alexandria, he never spoke evil of the high priest Jochanan who was responsible for his exile.
But Nittai of Arbela held a more pessimistic point of view. He stated: Keep far from an evil neighbor and do not consort with the wicked and do not despair in time of punishment. This pessimism of Nittai of Arbela, which ended on a hopeful note, was an outgrowth of his life experiences. It is probable that he was friendly to the Sadducees in his youth and realized later the dangers which are inherent in friendship with them. But he did not despair of the situation and never gave up hoping that the times would change for the better.
In time conditions did change in Jerusalem. The High Priest Jochanan died and in his will he appointed his wife queen and his son Aristobulus High Priest. But Aristobulus seized the royal crown and, when was chided by his mother for not adhering to his father’s will, he imprisoned her together with three of his younger brothers. While in prison the queen was allowed to die of starvation. A disagreement between Aristobulus and his brother Antigonos, who was the leader of the army, led to the assassination of Antigonos. Aristobulus died a short time later and was succeeded by his widow Salome. She freed the third son of Jochanan, Alexander Jannai. Alexander married the childless widow of his brother, even though as High Priest he was forbidden to marry a widow, and together they reigned over the land.
Queen Salome was friendly to the Pharisees and she appointed her brother Simeon b. Shetach religious head. Simeon immediately invited Joshua b. Perachia to return from Egypt. Joshua hastened to Jerusalem but whether he resumed his previous position remains unknown.
It is related that Joshua b. Perachia once came in conflict with one of his disciples named Jeshu. (Some would have it that Jeshu was identical with Jesus, but this is altogether impossible since Jesus lived during the latter part of the reign of Herod. This would place the event in the 160th year of the life of Joshua b. Perachia.) Once, when Joshua lived in Egypt, he was kindly treated by the proprietress of his hostelry. Joshua praised her to his disciples and said: “See what a beautiful woman she is.” The disciple named Jeshu said to him: “Rabbi, she is not beautiful for her eyes are almond shaped.” Thereupon Joshua said to him: “Wicked man, are you concerned with such trifles?” and he drove him away. This disciple returned numerous times to attempt to reconcile his master but Joshua paid no attention to him. Once the disciple came while Joshua was in the midst of reciting the Shema and was ready to forgive him. Joshua motioned to him with his hand to wait until he would complete the prayer. The disciple misunderstood this motion and believed that he was being driven out. He thereupon left and began to devote himself to magic. Joshua went to the house of his disciple to tell him that he would be forgiven if he repented, but he was told that it was too late.

Judah ben Tabbai and Simeon ben Shetach

Judah b. Tabbai and Simeon b. Shetach were the third of the “pairs” in the series of dual leadership. It is not clear which one of them was Nasi of the Sanhedrin and which one was head of the court. The name of Judah b. Tabbai is listed first whenever they are mentioned together which may lead to the conclusion that he was the Nasi. However, there exists an opinion that Simeon b. Shetach was Nasi and Judah b. Tabbai was head of the Court.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה ט״ז ב׳.</span></i>
They both lived in an unsettled period. The Sadducees were strongly entrenched in the government of Judea and the struggle with them was difficult and protracted. After the death of the High Priest Jochanan, the throne was assumed by his son Aristobulus and shortly after that it was ascended by his widow who married Alexander Jannai. This marked the beginning of a new epoch for the Pharisees. The new king, who is always referred to under the name of Jannai, was too preoccupied with matters of state to devote himself to the religious problems of the country during the first years of his reign. He therefore left these matters to the queen who referred them to her brother Simeon b. Shetach. Simeon could not free the country of the Sadducee leadership all at once and he therefore proceeded gradually. At first he was the only Pharisee in the Synhedrion. He made it a practice to challenge the decisions of the Synhedrion and to demand that such decisions be authenticated by the text of the Torah. Such proof had to be produced in the presence of the king and queen and he utilized these opportunities to point out that the Sadducees did not interpret the Torah correctly. One by one he managed to remove the Sadducees from the Synhedrion and to replace them with Pharisees.
The conflict between the Sadducees and the Pharisees thus reached a breaking point. The majority of the religious decisions which Simeon b. Shetach sponsored were largely a protest against the opinions of the Sadducees whose influence on Jewish life he tried to eradicate.
Alexander Jannai spent most of his time in extensive wars during which the freedom of the country was frequently threatened. When, upon his return from a victorious war, he realized that the Pharisees had gained the upper hand in the religious life of the land, he decided to humble them. During the festival of Succoth, as he was standing near the altar and preparing to pour water upon it (a custom much in favor with the Pharisees) he poured the water on his feet instead. Greatly enraged, the populace threw their ethrogim at the king and called him insulting names. The king evidently expected this reaction of the people for he previously stationed a number of mercenaries outside the temple. When the disturbance began the soldiers were called in and a terrible slaughter ensued. Later the king had eight hundred Pharisees, who escaped from the temple, also executed.
Many prominent Pharisees then fled from Jerusalem. Some of them sought refuge in Egypt where they were welcomed with open arms while others hid in the mountains and caves of Judea. Among those who hid in the country was also Simeon b. Shetach who realized that his sister, the queen, could defend him no longer.
Judah b. Tabbai sought shelter in Egypt. It is related that just as Simeon b. Shetach recalled Joshua b. Perachia during the first years of the reign of Alexander Jannai, he thus similarly recalled Judah b. Tabbai at a later date. In his letter recalling Joshua b. Perachia Simeon wrote: “From me, the holy city Jerusalem to you, my sister Alexandria. My master resides within you while I am deserted.” When Simeon invited Judah b. Tabbai he wrote: “From the great city of Jerusalem to the small Alexandria! How long will my bridegroom reside with you while I am sorrowing for him?”
Of the manner in which Simeon b. Shetach returned to Jerusalem from his hiding place it is told that once Alexander Jannai entertained foreign guests. When the assembled were merry with food and drink one of them said: “We remember that a few years ago you had here an old man who entertained us with his wise maxims. Where is he now? Will you call him here?” Jannai looked toward the queen and after he promised her that no harm would befall him, Simeon appeared before the king.
For a short time the persecution of the Pharisees ceased. The king desired to reconcile the people and he sent messengers to inquire of them what he should do to regain their devotion. But the people would not hear of reconciliation and answered that only the death of the king would eradicate the memory of the bloodshed. Some of the Pharisees were not satisfied with this reply and allied themselves with a foreign ruler to oust Alexander Jannai. This still further enraged Jannai against the Pharisees and when he defeated the foreign invader, he had a great number of Pharisees executed.
This last act of revenge stilled the king’s anger against the Pharisees and he persecuted them no more. On the contrary, he became convinced that in order to possess the throne securely, a Jewish sovereign could have no subjects more loyal than the Pharisees. On his death bed he admonished the queen to fear neither the Pharisees nor the Sadducees but only to beware of those who pretend to be Pharisees and commit the acts of Zimri while they demand the reward of Pinchas.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה כ״ב ב׳.</span></i>
Jannai died at the age of 49 after a reign of twenty seven years. Before he died he appointed the queen to rule the country and asked her to keep his death a secret as long as possible. She fulfilled his wish and appointed their son Hyrcanus High Priest. Simeon b. Shetach resumed his post as head of the Synhedrion (or of the court) and directed all his energies to the struggles with the Sadducees whose teachings he was determined to eradicate. He introduced the law of the “dissenting elder” which prescribed the death sentence for any member of the Synhedrion who opposed a majority in interpreting the law even if the dissenter held to a more severe interpretation or attempted to add to the laws enjoined by the Torah.
Nothing is known of the activities of Judah b. Tabbai during this time. He is mentioned only once as having permitted the execution of a false witness whose testimony would have caused a death sentence to be passed on the defendant if it had been accepted. The Pharisees held that in such a case the false witness should be executd even though the defendant was not put to death. The Sadducees, on the other hand, maintained that as long as the defendant was not put to death the false witness too should not be executed. It was also accepted to pass the same sentence on both witnesses of the prosecution.
When Judah b. Tabbai thus sentenced a single perjured witness to death, Simeon b. Shetach told him that he had caused the blood of an innocent man to be shed because the testimony of two witnesses was required to condemn the defendant. One false witness could under no circumstance cause a death sentence to be passed. Judah b. Tabbai realized his error and thenceforth refused to pass sentence in the absence of Simeon b. Shetach. He frequently visited the grave of the executed witness where he wept bitterly. It was said that whoever heard Judah b. Tabbai weep thought that he heard the weeping of the slain man.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה ט״ז א׳.</span></i>
The following maxim of Judah b. Tabbai has come down to us: “Do not make yourself as one of the advocates; when the suitors are before you let them be as wrongdoers in your sight and when they have departed let them be as innocent men in your estimation seeing they have accepted the sentence.”
Simeon b. Shetach used to say: “Examine thoroughly the witnesses and be careful in your words lest through them they may learn to lie.”
Judah b. Tabbai was noted for his modesty. To illustrate the harm which success may bring to a person he used to tell the following: If someone would have told me before I attained greatness that I would succeed I would have become his enemy for life. Now that I have attained greatness, were someone to tell me that I will lose it, I would be ready to pour boiling water on him.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אָבות דרבי נתן פרק י׳.</span></i>
There is a story related of the sojourn of Judah b. Tabbai in Egypt which is very similar to the one told about Joshua b. Perachia. Praising the generosity of the proprietress of his hostelry, he said to his disciples: Do you remember the proprietress who treated me so generously? To this one of his pupils remarked: Rabbi, she had diseased eyes. Judah b. Tabbai said to him: With one statement you have commited two wrongs. You suspected me of having considered the beauty of that woman and I also see that you carefully looked at her face while I only beheld her good deeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי חגיגה פרק ב׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>
Witchcraft was commonly believed in Palestine at that time and many people fell under the influence of so called witches who undermined their religious beliefs. Although Simeon b. Shetach did not himself place any faith in the power of the “witches” he nevertheless realized that they were a pernicious influence and lead many to immorality. He therefore had eighty “witches” captured and hanged on the same day. Ordinarily he would not have permitted so many women to be executed on the same day even though the Bible commands that witches be put to death. But he defended his action on this occasion on the ground that the condition of the country required that this plague which was devouring the people like a contagious disease had to be uprooted.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין מ״ו א׳.</span></i>
Among the executed “witches” there were many whose relatives sought to avenge their deaths. These bribed false witnesses to testify that the son of Simeon b. Shetach committed a crime that was punishable by death. The Synhedrion, after hearing the testimony, condemned the young man to be put to death. But as he was being led to execution, the witnesses confessed their perjury. Simeon wanted to accept their recantation but his son said to him: “If you would have the teachings of the Pharisees accepted without question then you must not permit witnesses to repudiate their testimony. You must therefore accept this as my fate to become the means for the attainment of your ends.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי סנהדרין פרק ו׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i>
Simeon’s son was concerned lest it should become impossible to punish false witnesses if they were given the right to repudiate their previous testimony. Whether Simeon made other attempts to save his son and whether he was successful remains unknown.
Another time, it is told, Simeon saw a man with a knife in his hand pursuing another man into a ruin. Simeon followed him inside where he saw blood upon the knife and the other man wounded and expiring in agony. Simeon addressed the murderer: “Wicked man, it is clear who murdered this man, but you are lucky that I can do nothing to you for the Torah says that two witnesses are required to condemn a criminal while I am the only one who witnessed the crime.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ל״ז ב׳.</span></i>
That the relations between Simeon b. Shetach and king Jannai were never cordial even when they were together is amply illustrated by numerous stories concerning the two men. Once, it is told, a man was killed by a slave of the king. (Probably one of the king’s mercenaries.) The Synhedrion informed Jannai of the crime and the king sent his servant to face judgment by the court. But the court demanded that the king appear in person since in the eyes of the law a slave was like any other livestock for which its owner is responsible. When Jannai appeared before the Synhedrion he sat down and Simeon b. Shetach said to him: “King Jannai, stand on your feet, not to honor us but in honor of the Creator of the universe.” To this Jannai replied: I will stand only if your colleagues will also demand it. But all the members of the Synhedrion remained silent. Simeon turned to his right and he saw them lower their eyes; he turned to his left and he met the same sight. Simeon thereupon said: Let him who can read your thoughts punish you for your thoughts at this moment.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין י״ט א׳.</span></i> Since that time the law was established that a king could not judge nor could he be judged; he was not to be called as a witness nor was anyone to bear testimony against him.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין י״ט ב׳.</span></i>
One of the important regulations instituted by Simeon b. Shetach concerned the <span dir="rtl">״כתובה״</span> (marriage certificate) of a woman. Until that time women had no right over the property of their husbands. The husband gave to the father of the bride a sum mentioned in the Kethubah. When a man wanted to divorce his wife he said to her: Go and take the money of the Kethubah from your father. Simeon b. Shetach ruled that the husband should retain the sum specified in the Kethubah. In this manner the wife became a partner to all his possessions which served as her guarantee. Indirectly it also made it more difficult to obtain a divorce.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת י״ב ב׳.</span></i>
Simeon b. Shetach also ruled that every father must engage a teacher for his children. Previously it was customary for a parent who wanted his son to acquire knowledge to send him to the academies of the great scholars; otherwise the children grew up in ignorance and came in contact with religious training only on the rare occasions when they visited Jerusalem.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי כתובות פרק ח׳ הלכה י״א.</span></i>
Simeon b. Shetach lived in poverty most of his life. During the time that he was in hiding to save his life from the wrath of his royal brother-in-law, he could not utilize his scholarship to gain a livelihood. He then became a flax merchant. Once he bought a donkey from an Ishmaelite. When he brought his donkey home, his disciples found a diamond in a little bag tied around the animal’s neck. They said to their teacher: God’s blessing has made you rich. But Simeon answered: I only bought the animal but not the diamond. When he returned the diamond to the Ishmaelite the latter exclaimed: Praised be the God of Simeon b. Shetach.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי בבא מציעא פרק ב׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>
After his death, Alexander Jannai was succeeded by his widow Salome, the sister of Simeon b. Shetach, who ruled for nine years until her death at the age of 73. The date of Simeon’s death remains unknown.

Shemaiah and Abtalion

S<small>HEMAIAH AND</small> A<small>BTALION</small> succeeded Judah b. Tabbai and Simeon b. Shetach to leadership in Jewish life. Shemaiah became Nasi of the Sanhedrin and Abtalion occupied the post of head of the court.
Of their descent it is told that they were children or grandchildren of proselytes. But despite the fact that the position of the descendants of proselytes, even to the tenth generation, was not very favorable, they achieved the highest honors which Jews of that time could hope to attain. It is also necessary to remember that Shemaiah and Abtalion lived before the treason of the Idumeans and proselytes were therefore not viewed with suspicion.
We also do not know who chose these two scholars to their positions and whether their election was peacefully accomplished. It is possible that the king of Judea, who surrounded himself with mercenaries to protect himself from his subjects, purposely chose descendants of proselytes to head the Sanhedrin in the hope that they would side with the Sadducees. However, if that was his intention he was mistaken, for although Shemaiah and Abtalion were peaceful people who did not meddle in politics, they faithfully clung to the Pharisees and did not make the least change in the system of interpreting the commandments of the Torah as it was established by the previous scholars.
Shemaiah and Abtalion were influential during one of the unhappiest periods in Jewish history. Before her death, Salome, the widow of Alexander Jannai relinquished the throne to her son Jochanan Hyrcanus who was a peaceful retiring man. Jochanan’s brother, Aristobulus, did not approve of the arrangement and started a war against his brother which ended with a compromise. Aristobulus became king and Jochanan Hyrcanus assumed the High Priesthood. This arrangement may have proved to be lasting were it not for a friend of Hyrcanus, Antipater by name, who was a descendant of the forced Idumean converts, who were brought into the Jewish fold by Hyrcanus’ grandfather. Antipater sought to create discord between the two rulers. He tried to persuade Aristobulus that his brother was planning to regain the throne. But Aristobulus paid no heed to his accusation although there was some justification in it since Hyrcanus was the older of the two brothers and thus the rightful heir to the throne. Failing in this attempt, Antipater told Hyrcanus that Aristobulus wanted to be rid of him in order to unite the throne and the High Priest’s office in his person.<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">The names of the princes of the Hasmonean family were constantly repeated. This must be borne in mind when one comes across similar names.</i>
Antipater suggested that it would be easier to carry on a war against his brother from outside the city and advised that Hyrcanus leave Jerusalem. Hyrcanus accepted this advice and together with a host of followers he left the city. Hyrcanus established an alliance with a neighboring Arab king who was told that Aristobulus wished to annex his land and he was. promised considerable compensation for his aid in the forthcoming war against Aristobulus.
Reinforced by the Arab king, Hyrcanus besieged Jerusalem. This siege, however, was against the king only and not against the people and the besiegers decided to permit the daily sacrifice to be offered at the temple. Every day the priests within the city lowered a sum of money from the wall of the city and the besiegers hoisted up the animals required for the sacrifice.
One of the besiegers, a man who spoke Greek, told the soldiers to hoist up pigs instead of the usual animals because it would be impossible to take the city as long as the daily sacrifices were properly conducted. It is unknown where they obtained pigs in Palestine, but this act shocked the whole people who fantastically embellished the consequences of this horrible mockery. It was told that when the pigs stuck their nails (!) into the walls of Jerusalem the whole countryside shook for four hundred miles. A tornado accompanied by an earthquake swept the land. Darkness covered the land during midday and in one moment all the grain on the fields surrounding Jerusalem wilted. When it was later necessary to bring the “Omer,” the first ripened sheaf, there was none found near Jerusalem and it was necessary to bring one from a long distance.
The Sadducees had lost most of their influence by that time and when the inhabitants of the countryside about Jerusalem had to bring the Paschal lamb but could not enter the city, they went to offer this sacrifice in the temple of Onias in Alexandria.
Jerusalem continued to withstand the siege. The besiegers could not take the fortress by storm and the besieged would not surrender. Both contending brothers then appealed to the Roman general Pompey, who happened to be near Palestine, to arbitrate between them. Pompey arrived in Jerusalem with a large army. He removed Aristobulus and executed many of his followers and he appointed Hyrcanus High Priest with the title of Ethnarch, ruler of the land as representative of Rome. To impress upon Hyrcanus still further that he was not an independent ruler, Pompey appointed Antipater as his assistant in the secular government of the land. Antipater thus became virtual ruler of the country and Hyrcanus had to be satisfied with the High Priesthood and the official title of Ethnarch.
After the death of Aristobulus, his two sons Alexander and Antigonos continued the struggle against Hyrcanus to regain the country. They formed an alliance with the Persians and with their aid Antigonos, the younger son of Aristobulus, succeeded in defeating Hyrcanus and he led him as a captive to Babylonia. Antigonos maintained himself in Jerusalem for three years. At the end of that time, Herod, the son of Antipater, appeared with a large Roman army. Antigonos was overthrown as a rebel against the Romans and the throne was occupied by Herod who recalled Hyrcanus to the High Priesthood.
These wars lasted for more than thirty years and caused endless suffering but scholarship and the learning of the Torah did not cease. For a short time the Sanhedrin were divided into five parts according to the division of Palestine under five governors. By means of this division the Romans wanted to weaken the power of the Sanhedrin; but as this attempt failed the Sanhedrin were again reunited in Jerusalem under the leadership of Shemaiah and Abtalion.
There is a legend that Shemaiah and Abtalion were descendants of Sancherib, king of Assyria. They did not interfere with the political affairs of the country and it is possible that as descendants of converts they did not feel very keenly the national humiliation which the Jews had to withstand in their own country. As long as they were permitted to observe the Torah according to the interpretations of the Pharisees and the temple was not disturbed, they interested themselves but little with the political storms which were agitating the land.
Two maxims of Shemaiah and Abtalion have come down to us. These sayings are not entirely clear and require some elucidation. Shemaiah said: Love work and hate mastery and do not mingle with the officials. Abtalion said: Wise men, take heed of your words lest you incur the guilt which is punished by exile and you shall be exiled to a place of evil water and the disciples that come after you will drink and die and the name of Heaven will be profaned.
It is evident that both of the sayings referred to the events of the time. All those who sought to rule met with misfortune and many of the scholars had to seek refuge in Egypt where their disciples absorbed many new ideas which were opposed to those current in Palestine.
Shemaiah and Abtalion sought to limit the number of students in their academy and instituted a fee of admission for some reason which has not been definitely established. Every one had to pay a half-penny to the gate keeper. This sum was considered quite large and at that time a person had to work half a day to earn it.
Since the downfall of Aristobulus, there remained small detachments of his army which roamed in the Galilee and conducted a guerilla warfare against the Syrians and Romans. Herod tracked them down with great cruelty until he finally captured their leader, Hezekiah, and killed him together with some of his men. The populace was enraged against Herod and, with the consent of Hyrcanus, he was summoned to appear for trial before the Sanhedrin. Herod appeared not as a defendant but as a great commander dressed in purple and armed with a sword. He was surrounded by a large number of warriors, all armed, who were ready to attack anyone that should attempt to touch Herod. The Sanhedrin was displeased but out of fear its members maintained silence. Shemaiah warned them not to spare the defendant, for if they showed fear Herod would convict them at some future time. Encouraged by Shemaiah’s words they began to question Herod and the witnesses. However, when Hyrcanus saw that the Sanhedrin might convict Herod he suggested postponing the sentence till the following day. On that night Herod fled from Jerusalem.
Later, when Herod became virtual ruler of the country, he remembered that the scholars dared to bring him to trial and he persecuted them. Many of them were killed but he spared Shemaiah and Abtalion. He was deeply impressed by Shemaiah’s courageous stand at that trial and he also feared to touch the most prominent Elders of the nation. He therefore waited until they died a natural death.
All the wrongs which the Hasmoneans ever committed against their people, their persecution of the Pharisees, their civil wars, their immorality and imitation of the Greek code of morals, all of these were visited upon the Hasmonean family and upon the people during that terrible time when they suffered the yoke of Herod. For Herod the people had no other appelation than the “Idumean slave.” Secretly the people admitted that they deserved this punishment because they permitted the House of David to be exterminated and allowed the priests to become the rulers.
Shemaiah and Abtalion exhibited their courage on still another occasion. Once, when the High Priest was returning home after the service of the Day of Atonement accompanied by the whole people, he met Shemaiah and Abtalion. The people thereupon left the High Priest to follow Shemaiah and Abtalion. Although he was angered, the High Priest said nothing at the moment. When Shemaiah and Abtalion later came up to greet him he said to them: “Let the children of the Gentiles go in peace.” This hint at their non-Jewish origin evoked the following response from Shemaiah and Abtalion: “Let the children of the Gentiles come in peace, for they do the deeds of Aaron who was a lover of peace, but let the son of Aaron not come in peace, for he does not follow in the ways of Aaron.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא ע״א ב׳.</span></i>

The Men of Bathyra

H<small>EROD, THE SON OF</small> A<small>NTIPATER</small>, who was one of the Idumean proselytes, seized the government of the country. His every move was drowned in Jewish blood and he annihilated all the scholars of that time. He was especially vengeful toward those people who had any relation to the royal Hasmonean family. He spared the two representatives of the Sanhedrin Shemaiah and Abtalion. Because of their advanced age he considered it wise to wait until they died. Not many years passed before both of them died a natural death.
The years in which the two leaders died, and which of them passed away first we do not know. But we do know that for a considerable length of time after their death scholarship was on the decline. The people were preoccupied with the political situation which was desperate and whenever the Talmud refers to those days it hints that it was a period in which the Torah was being forgotten by the people. One virtue characterized the time that those who were ignorant revered those who possessed knowledge. In later years the situation changed to such an extent that people were ashamed of scholarship and the ignorant “Am Haaretz” was reckoned higher than a scholar.
In the place of Shemaiah and Abtalion there came two men who are unknown but for their city of origin. The Talmud calls them the men of Bathyra. No mention is made of their descent but they probably were not related or they could not both have been members of the Sanhedrin. The city Bathyra, from which they came, was located in north eastern Palestine near Mount Hermon. It was founded as a fortress against the attacks of roving robber bands who wandered near the boundary.
The Torah, as was stated above, was largely forgotten among the people but we may assume that here and there scholars were still to be found outside of Jerusalem. When Herod had to choose new leaders for the Sanhedrin he sought them among the scholars of the outlying districts in the conviction that men of the provinces would be loyal to him and would do his bidding.
The men of Bathyra—it must be noted—were pious, God fearing and modest and endeavored with all their might to preserve the Jewish faith. They did not deviate from any of the ways of the Pharisees. Only once were they in doubt about the observance of a religious law. It happened that Passover eve fell on a Saturday and they did not know whether the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb superseded the Sabbath and should be offered as on a week day or whether the sacrifice should not be offered at all.
They spent a long time seeking for a solution but they could not find it, neither was there anyone in Jerusalem who could inform them. They were ready to declare that since an ordinary feast day offering does not supersede the Sabbath, neither does the Paschal lamb offering. Then there came a man before them and said that in Jerusalem there lived a man named Hillel of Babylon who studied with Shemaiah and Abtalion and he would certainly know whether the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb supersedes the Sabbath. Hillel was summoned before them and he declared that the offering of the Paschal lamb does supersede the Sabbath. The men of Bathyra did not want to accept his opinion until he assured them that he received this law from Shemaiah and Abtalion. When they heard this they believed him and, being honestly ashamed of their ignorance, they publicly withdrew from their positions and declared that they were not worthy to retain them.
In later years numerous versions of this event developed. The great modesty of the men of Bathyra was frequently recalled and many a man remarked: I could do everything but not what the men of Bathyra did.
Meanwhile Herod continued his bloody rule of the land. In his war against Jerusalem he wiped out all male descendants of the Hasmoneans with the aid of the Romans. Later, attempting to gain the confidence of the people, he married the Hasmonean princess Miriam who was the daughter of Alexander, the son of Aristobulus and the grandson of king Alexander Jannai. On her mother’s side Miriam was a grand daughter of king Hyrcanus. All this time, while Herod was becoming firmly entrenched in the country and was annihilating the Hasmonean dynasty, Hyrcanus stayed in Babylonia. The Babylonian Jews promised to defend him loyally all his life. But Herod was dissatisfied with this state of affairs and by various wiles he succeeded in bringing Hyrcanus back to Palestine. Afterward he had Hyrcanus crippled through cutting off one of his ears in order to make him unfit for the priesthood. But even a crippled Hasmonean seemed too dangerous to Herod and he accused him of allying himself with the enemies of the country. He allowed Hyrcanus, who once saved Herod from the Sanhedrin, to be sentenced to death in spite of his great age. Hyrcanus was then 81 years old.
Herod then chose Chanamel as High Priest. It was rumored that Chanamel was a descendant of Onias the son of Simeon the Just and Herod hoped to utilize this man for his political ambitions. But Herod was soon forced by circumstances to appoint as High Priest the only remaining Hasmonean, Aristobulus, the brother of his wife Miriam. He allowed Aristobulus to conduct the service in the temple once and then he invited him to visit Jericho with him. While they were bathing in the Jordan Aristobulus was drowned by one of Herod’s servants. Chanamel was reinstated to the high priesthood for a short time.
Herod changed High Priests very frequently as his whim dictated. When some of the ambitious priests realized that the high priesthood was no longer an office to be inherited they outdid one another in the sums that they were ready to pay for the office. The people called these priests by various nick names because the office changed hands nearly every year and frequently the high priest did not maintain himself even for that length of time.
We must keep in mind, however, that no matter how barbarous the behavior of Herod, he never tried to undermine the Jewish religion. Whenever he acted against the laws of the faith he did so because he felt that the religious commandments interfered with his political ambitions.
No one, not even the nearest friends of the king, were certain of their lives. In previous years the Sadducees tried to do away with the Torah and some of the Hasmoneans aided them in this effort. But Herod did not try to interfere with the laws. He did not care whether Judaism developed along the lines laid out by the Pharisees nor would he have minded if the Sadducees had their way. But he annihilated everyone whom he suspected of opposition to himself, and in those days it was an easy matter to accomplish this. One command of Herod was sufficient to lead hundreds of men to execution. He thus did away with the Hasmoneans and later he executed his beloved wife, his mother in law and his own sons. Not in vain was it said in Rome that only a pig is safe in Herod’s house, because being a Jew he would not kill it.

Choni the Circle Drawer

C<small>HONI THE CIRCLE DRAWER</small> was one of the saintliest of the Tannaim. Of all his ethical maxims there remains but one which states: if a man does not enjoy the society of his fellows it is as if he were dead. Of his interpretations of the commandments of the Torah none remain, although it is said of him that his penetrating reasoning solved all the doubts of the other scholars.
The name of Choni is surrounded with wonderful legends wherever it is mentioned in the Talmud. His every move was accompanied with miracles and he was described as one to whom God refused no request.
The name Choni was not rare in those days and probably was an abbreviated form of Chonio or Chunia. But the appellation of circle drawer is unique in history and does not appear again in connection with any other name that has come down through the ages. The exact meaning of this appellation (in Hebrew: “Hamagel”) has not been determined. According to the book of geneology he was called Hamagel because he hailed from a city named Megilo. Others maintain that he received this name because, according to legend, he once slept for seventy years and they interpret Hamagel to mean—one who has rested on the way. But the most common explanation is based on the legend that he once drew a circle about himself and took an oath not to stir out of it until God would fulfill his wish.
Once—so relates a Mishna in Taanith—there was a protracted drought in the country. According to some there had been no rain for three years. It was already the twentieth day of Adar when everyone was expecting the late rains that mature the grain but still there appeared not the smallest cloud. Trees and grass were withered and the people feared the famine that was bound to come. They then came to Choni the circle drawer with a request that he pray to God for rain. Because of Choni’s great piety every one felt convinced that his appeal for rain would not be denied by God and a request by him would be considered as a command.
Choni said to the people: Take the Passover ovens into your houses that they may not be moistened by the rain. (Ovens that were moistened were not considered fit for Passover use and Choni felt certain that his prayer for rain would be answered.)
Choni prayed for a long time but still there was no rain. He thereupon drew a circle about himself and said to God: Creator of the world! Your children have turned to me that I should pray for rain because they think that I am acceptable in your sight. I swear by your great name that I will not stir from here until you will have mercy on your children.
Small drops of rain began to fall. Choni’s disciples then said to him: God has permitted these few drops to fall so that you may not break your oath. Choni addressed God again: Not for these few drops have I prayed. I prayed for a rain that should fill the wells with water. As he finished speaking a heavy rain accompanied by a storm began to descend and every drop of water was large enough to fill a barrel. His disciples again appealed to Choni: God is sending down a rain which will flood the world. Choni again appealed to God: Not for this have I prayed. I prayed for rain that should bring blessing to the fields.
There then began to fall an ordinary rain until all wells were filled and the streets of Jerusalem were flooded. Some of the residents of those streets sought refuge on the temple mountain while others came to Choni with a new request, that just as he prayed for rain and it was granted even so he should now pray for the rain to cease. Choni asked them to see if the wanderer’s stone was already covered with water for as long as that stone was not submerged he could not ask that the rain cease. (The wanderer’s stone was a place where all lost articles were redeemed by their owners upon identification.)
Later they brought an ox to be sacrificed to God that the rain might cease. Choni placed both hands on the offering and said: “Thy people Israel which you have redeemed from Egypt cannot bear too great a bounty even as they cannot bear too much punishment. When you were displeased with them they could not withstand your anger and besought me to intervene with you on their behalf. Now that you have bestowed upon them too much generosity they cannot bear this either. Therefore, Creator of the world, I beg of you to consider the rain that fell so far sufficient and to permit the world to breathe freely again.”
Immediately a strong wind arose and dispersed the clouds. The sun shone warm and the people scattered over the fields to gather mushrooms.
This is said to have occurred during the lifetime of Simeon b. Shetach who was greatly angered that Choni almost forced God to change his will in order to please one pious man. Simeon b. Shetach sent a message to Choni saying: “If you were not Choni I would have you excommunicated, but I can do nothing to you because you are to God as a petulant child and he fulfills your wishes even as a father fulfills the wishes of his favorite son.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית כ״ג א׳.</span></i>
Josephus relates that Choni was killed in the war between the brothers Hyrcanus and Aristobulus. Hyrcanus was then besieging Jerusalem while Aristobulus fortified himself in the temple on mount Moriah. One day Choni was captured by the soldiers of Hyrcanus and brought to their camp. They then asked him to pray to God to help them defeat Aristobulus. Choni thereupon recited the following prayer: “Creator of the world! Have mercy on both contending sides, for on one side are your priests and on the other side are your children. I pray that you shall not heed the curses of one on the other.” This prayer so enraged the soldiers of Hyrcanus that they killed him.
But the Talmud has woven another legend about the last days of Choni. It was said that Choni grieved because he could not comprehend the meaning of the verse “When God returned the captivity of Zion we were as dreamers.” He constantly asked: Is it possible for a person to sleep for seventy years and have the same dream?
Once, as he was walking on his way, he saw a man planting a carob tree and asked him: “How long does one wait until this tree will bear fruit?” The man replied: “It takes seventy years.” Choni asked him: “Are you certain that you will live another seventy years?” But the man replied: “The whole world is like a carob tree. My forefathers planted for me and I am planting the tree for my children.”
Choni sat down to weave baskets and a deep sleep descended upon him. The crag of a mountain extended to cover him and to hide him from the eyes of passers-by. He slept there for seventy years.
When he awoke he saw a man picking the fruit of the tree that was planted when he fell asleep. Choni asked him: “Are you the man who planted the tree?” The man replied: “I am not he. The man who planted the tree was my grandfather.” Choni realized that he slept for seventy years and he went to his home to inquire for Choni. There he was told that both Choni as well as his son were no longer living.
He said to the people, “I am Choni,” but they would not believe him. He therefore went to the academy where he had the scholars repeat his interpretations of the Torah and he heard one of them say, “I wish we had a man like Choni today who could elucidate all the hard questions.” He said to them, “I am Choni,” but they would not believe him either, and did not accord him the proper respect. This pained Choni very much and he used to repeat: A man who does not enjoy the society of his fellows is as if he were dead.
According to another Talmudic version, Choni lived during the last days of the first temple and he slept all the years of the Babylonian captivity. He awoke from his sleep when the Jews began to return from Babylonia. Of the Choni who prayed for rain, the Jerusalem Talmud claims that he was the grandson of the first Choni.
The Jerusalem Talmud continues to relate of the Choni who slept for seventy years that when he awoke he asked what was going on in the world and his hearers wondered that he did not know that the temple was destroyed and was being rebuilt again. They would not believe him when he said that he was Choni. But as he kept on repeating this the people said to him: “If you are Choni you have to prove it. We heard that when the real Choni entered the Temple the whole house became suffused with light. We want to see you do likewise.” Choni entered the temple and immediately a light spread throughout the building. He then said: “When God returned the captivity of Zion we were as dreamers.”

Hillel

K<small>ING</small> H<small>EROD</small> inaugurated his reign with the slaughter of all the outstanding scholars in the country. He destroyed them, just as he annihilated the Hasmonean dynasty, out of conviction that they would challenge his right to the throne. He knew that the scholars secretly called him the “Idumean slave” and that because of the fact that he was married to a Hasmonean princess, in order to establish a Herodian-Hasmonean dynasty, they established a rule that whoever pretends to be of Hasmonean descent is a slave.
But since Herod could not under any circumstances abolish the Torah, he had to recognize the religious authority of the Sanhedrin. His first attempt was to appoint the men of Bathyra to head the Sanhedrin but these voluntarily resigned in favor of Hillel of Babylonia. Herod was thus forced by circumstances to recognize the significance of Hillel and to tolerate his control of the religious life even as he previously was forced to spare the aged Shemaiah and Abtalion.
The appelation Babylonian clearly indicates that Hillel was born in Babylonia; in order to differentiate him from other scholars who were named Hillel he was also called Hillel the Old.
When Hillel came to Palestine he was in his late thirties and already possessed much knowledge. He came to the country in order to clarify for himself three religious questions of which he was in doubt. These were: 1) Whether a man who underwent purification had to be declared pure by a priest or whether the procedure of purification was sufficient. 2) The disagreement between two texts of the Bible one of which says that the Paschal offering is to be made from sheep and cattle and the other states that the offering is to be selected from the sheep and the goats. 3) The contradiction between two texts one of which enjoins that Matzoth be eaten for six days and the other that they should be eaten for seven days.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי פּסחים פרק ו׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
He sought clarification on these questions from Shemaiah and Abtalion and was ready to return to Babylonia, where he lived in favorable circumstances. He had one brother who was a merchant and his other relatives undoubtedly also aided him. But his great desire for learning delayed his return and as time went by it still seemed to him that he did not know enough. He thus became estranged from his native country where Jews lived in peace and he was not frightened by the discord and political revolutions which agitated Palestine.
The Babylonian Jews of that time were pious and God fearing people who observed all the regulations of Judaism in so far as that could be done outside of Palestine. They were especially strict in their observance of the Sabbath to its minutest details and they sent their “Shkolim” and sacrifices to Jerusalem. But there was a lack of colleges for the study of the Torah and the Babylonian Jews were therefore held in contempt by the Palestinian Jews for their ignorance. In addition both Babylonian and Palestinian Jews believed that only in Palestine could the religious regulations be correctly interpreted and any regulation which did not have the sanction of the Great Court of Jerusalem was not accepted by the people.
While studying with Shemaiah and Abtalion, Hillel lived in straitened circumstances and earned his livelihood from hard labor. Altogether he earned but a small coin a day, half of which he spent for himself and his household and the other half he gave to the gate keeper of the academy. But one day he did not earn any money. Neither he nor his family ate on that day but, being anxious to hear the discourse of Shemaiah and Abtalion and not having the money to pay the gate keeper, Hillel climbed onto the roof of the academy and lay near the chimney where he could hear the discussion inside. All night he thus lay on the roof. This was in the month of Tebeth in midwinter and all that night it snowed and the snow covered his whole body to a great height.
On the following morning the academy seemed darker than usual. The sky light was covered with snow, but when the people looked closer they saw the body of a man under the snow. They immediately went up and removed the snow and recognized the man as Hillel. They washed him and annointed his body with oil and warmed him before the fire. Although such work is prohibited on the Sabbath the scholars declared that a man like Hillel deserved that the Sabbath be desecrated for his sake.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא ל״ה ב׳.</span></i>
All this time Hillel did not reveal his great knowledge. Besides Shemaiah and Abtalion no one knew him intimately, neither did he confide in anyone whether he and his household were in need.
After the death of Shemaiah and Abtalion he apparently returned to Babylonia but he frequently visited Jerusalem whenever any doubt arose in his mind. Mostly he came before the feast days in observance of the commandment to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, but he always kept in the background. Once, on the eve of Passover, which occurred on a Saturday, the men of Bathyra, who were the religious authorities, were in doubt whether the Paschal lamb offering should supersede the Sabbath or whether it should not be offered at all because of it. One of their pupils rose and said to them: “There is present a man from Babylonia who studied under Shemaiah and Abtalion; he will certainly know the law.” But the men of Bathyra nodded their heads as if to say: “What can one learn from a Babylonian?”
Nevertheless they summoned Hillel and asked him what should be done. Hillel said: “Are you concerned about the Paschal lamb only when there are many other sacrifices offered on the Sabbath?” He expounded the rules of the Torah all day to prove that the Paschal lamb offering supersedes the Sabbath. Still they would not listen to him until he said that he received the law from Shemaiah and Abtalion.
They then asked him: “What should be done if the people do not bring the slaughtering knives? For even if the offering of the sacrifice supersedes the Sabbath it still remains prohibited to carry any object on that day.” Hillel then replied: “I do not remember what Shemaiah and Abtalion taught in this matter but I am certain that the people will know the law, for whenever there is any doubt what to do one should observe the custom of the people and decide the law accordingly.”
On the following day, Passover eve, it happened just as Hillel predicted. The people brought their sacrifices and had the slaughtering knives hidden in the wool of the lambs and among the horns of the goats. When Hillel saw this he remembered that Shemaiah and Abtalion instructed that it should be done so.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים ס״ו א׳, ירושלמי פּסחים פרק וי הלכה א׳.</span></i>
Hillel was the first of the authors of the Mishnah who insisted that the object of religion is to enforce the fulfillment of the duties of one man toward another and that all practical commandments are but a means to this end. He therefore established the principle of brotherly love as the main condition for all the commandments of the Torah. Once, when a Gentile wanted to adopt Judaism on one condition, that he be taught the whole Torah in the time that he could stand on one foot, Hillel gave him but one rule: Do not unto thy neighbor what you would not have him do unto you. This is the whole Jewish law, he said. All else are but commentaries on their commandment which you will know when you study them.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ל״א א׳.</span></i>
Hillel was very gentle in his relations with other people and suffered their capricious behavior without anger. He particularly insisted on showing friendship to the poor. Not only did he provide them with necessities but also with such luxuries as they were previously unused to. Once he provided a poor man with a horse and a slave to run before him, as was the custom. However, when he could not obtain a slave, he ran before the man himself for three miles.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ס״ז א׳.</span></i>
Hillel’s modesty and unusual patience gained wide renown and many interesting stories were told of futile attempts to make him angry. After the person who wanted to learn the whole Jewish law while standing on one foot, there appeared before Hillel a heathen who was ready to embrace Judaism on condition that he be made high priest. Hillel answered both of them satisfactorily and converted them.
Probably the most interesting story concerns a man who wagered a large sum of money on angering Hillel. The man ran before Hillel’s house on a Friday, just as the time that Hillel was bathing in preparation for the Sabbath. In a loud voice he shouted: “Hillel, who is Hillel and where is he?” Hillel wrapped himself in a cloak and came out saying: “I am Hillel. What do you want, my son?”
“I want to ask you a question,” the man said.
“Ask,” Hillel replied, “and whatever I know I will tell you.”
“I want to know,” the man said, “why the Babylonians have round heads.”
“You asked a correct question,” Hillel answered. “It is because the Babylonians do not have skilled midwives; the heads of the newborn children become rounded in their hands.”
A moment later the man shouted again: “Hillel, where is Hillel?”
Again Hillel came out and said: “I am Hillel. What do you want, my son?”
“Can you tell me,” the man asked, “why the eyes of the people of Tadmor are weak?”
“You have asked well,” Hillel said; “it is because Tadmor is located in a sandy region and dust gets into people’s eyes.”
Once more the man shouted: “Hillel, where is Hillel?”
Hillel wrapped himself and came out saying: “Here I am, what do you want, my son?”
“I want to know,” the man said, “why the feet of the Africans are so wide.”
“It is a good question,” Hillel said, “it is a result of their going barefoot in swampy land.”
Thereupon the man said: “I wish to ask you other questions but I fear that you will be angry.”
“You may ask as many questions as you want and I shall answer them to the best of my knowledge,” Hillel said.
“Are you Hillel, who is a Nasi among Jews?” the man exclaimed.
“I am he,” Hillel replied.
“Then I wish the Jews that there should be no more like you among them,” the man said.
“Why do you wish them this?” Hillel asked.
“Because through you I have lost a large sum of money. I wagered that I will make you angry and now I do not know what to do to anger you.”
To this Hillel replied, “Even if you were to lose twice that sum, still you could not anger me.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ל׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Hillel served as Nasi from 30 B.C. to 10 C.E. In the prevailing political situation of the country it was significant that Hillel was a descendant of king David. (His mother was descended from Shefatia, the son of David.) The people considered him a scion of the royal house of David and accorded him appropriate honors. While everyone looked upon Herod as a tyrant whose only aim was to collect taxes for the foreign rulers and to protect the boundaries of the land, they revered Hillel as a religious leader and obeyed his every word. It was then that the benediction of the House of David, ending with the words, “He raises a ray of hope,” was introduced into the daily prayers (Shmoneh Esrei) and it is possible that the people looked upon Hillel’s exalted position as a beginning of the restoraion of the House of David. This was also the cause for the introduction of still another benediction, to be recited on Saturday after the reading of the prophets, which began with the words: “Gladden us, oh Lord, with the prophet Elijah, your servant, and with the kingdom of David your anointed” and ended with: “On his throne a stranger shall not sit nor shall others inherit his honor.”
From Hillel were descended three generations of N’siim who governed religious life for one hundred years. For the outside world Herod and his successors were the sovereigns of the country but the internal life of the nation, which concentrated about the faith, was guided by Hillel’s heirs.
Herod no doubt knew of the honor which was being accorded to Hillel and that he was looked upon as a successor of David, But in his political sagacity he realized that Hillel would constitute a real danger only if he claimed to be a descendant of the Hasmoneans.
In later generations Hillel’s importance was compared to that of Ezra. It was said that Ezra renewed the Torah after it was forgotten by the people and similarly Hillel came out of Babylonia and taught the Torah which was neglected after the death of Shemaiah and Abtalion.
The Talmud relates: Eighty of the most important men of the generation were pupils of Hillel. Thirty of these were worthy enough to have the “Shechinah” rest upon them even as it rested upon Moses. Another thirty were deserving to have the sun stop in its course for their sake even as it did for Joshua b. Nun. The remaining twenty were intermediate men and among them were such as Jonathan b. Uziel of whom it was said that his enthusiasm in studying the Torah was so great that were a bird to fly by him when he was expounding the law it would have been burnt by the flames of his enthusiasm.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוכה כ״ח א׳.</span></i>
Aside from his humility and patience Hillel was also noted for being satisfied with his lot and he was in the habit of saying: “Blessed be God for this day.” He was never worried over what the following day might bring and taught the members of his household to feel likewise. Once, as he was approaching his house, he heard shouts coming from that direction and he said to his disciples who were accompanying him to his home: “I am certain that these quarrel-some shouts do not come from my home.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ס׳ א׳.</span></i>
In his moral teachings he frequently used picturesque language and employed short epigrammatic maxims. It is therefore difficult at times to know his exact meaning, since these maxims can be interpreted in various ways. But this does not diminish their moral worth since, no matter how one interprets them, they still express elevated moral teachings which are an honor for the whole people which could produce a personality like Hillel in such difficult times as then prevailed.
One of his maxims stated: “Wherever my heart loves, there my feet lead me; if you will come to me then will I also come to you, but if you do not come to me neither can I come to you.” This maxim has been interpreted in many ways and many people found in it that which they sought.
Nearly every day, as he left his pupils, he was in the habit of saying that he was going to entertain a guest. Once they asked him: “Do you have a guest at home every day?” and he replied: “Our soul is only a guest with us; today it is here and tomorrow it may leave us.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ויקרא רבה ל״ד ג׳.</span></i>
But when Hillel spoke of entertaining a guest, he did not have in mind only food and drink, although he never underestimated these and said that it is a great virtue to preserve God’s image in man in the same purity as it was created. But he particularly insisted that man is obliged to perfect his spiritual self, for if a man does not do so himself no one will do it for him. To this he added that one man for himself counts for little and he must also have the assistance of others, and he stressed the importance of the present moment in one’s life, for if not now, when?
Hillel firmly believed that there was no unjust suffering and even when it seemed that divine justice was wrong one must bear in mind that all one’s deeds are reckoned and that one receives his punishment at the hands of another sinful creature. Once he saw a head floating upon the water. It was a time of many murders; Herod frequently allowed many people to be executed and had their bodies thrown into the water. Hillel believed that if those people had not deserved it, God would not have permitted their being killed but, at the same time, he was convinced that the murderers would also meet their punishment. He therefore addressed the floating head: “You drowned others and therefore you were drowned; but in the end your assassins will also be drowned.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוכה נ״ג א׳.</span></i>
Hillel placed learning in the very center of the scheme of life and he said that whoever refuses to study deserves to be condemned to death. Also, he insisted that one must not say “I will study when I will have time, for it is possible that one will never find the time. Study, he maintained, also leads to fear of God and he who is ignorant cannot be pious. But a person who devotes himself to learning in order to gain a great name for himself is certain to lose his name.
With all the power at his command Hillel strove to popularize the Torah. He said: “When others gather, you must spread; but when others spread, you must gather.” Seeing that the people did not understand him he explained his words in this manner: “When you see a generation which loves the Torah then you must spread your knowledge among them; but if you see a generation which does not love the Torah then you must hide your knowledge within yourself.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ס״ג א׳.</span></i>
In his exposition of the law Hillel was tolerant toward his opponents. This was contrary to the custom of the scholars of that generation who did not tolerate any divergence of opinion and sharply reacted to differing interpretations. Hillel expressed his opinions peacefully and when he tried to prove the truth of his statements he did so in a calm manner. He said that man must love peace and search for it. When one attains the state of love for his fellow man he brings other people closer to the Torah.
Although Hillel was devoted to the traditions of the “oral law,” he did not attack those who doubted them. He never drove the doubters from himself, as others did, but merely sought to convince them that it was impossible to observe the written law without recognizing the validity of the oral law. Once a heathen came to him saying that he wanted to embrace Judaism on condition that he learn the written law only. Hillel accepted him and then he showed him that it was impossible to study anything without accepting the opinions of one’s teacher. The proselyte understood that since he had to believe Hillel he also had to accept Hillel’s belief that the written law cannot be explained without the aid of the oral law.
The scholars preceding Hillel opposed the Sadducees violently but achieved little. Even Simeon b. Shetach, who opposed the Sadducees with the force of the government, could not prevail against them. But Hillel’s method of peaceful argumentation served its purpose. He said of them: “There were many sinners among the Jews who were brought close to the study of the Torah and in time they became pious and just men.”
So far as we know, Hillel was the first of the Tanaim to establish a system of expounding the laws of the Torah that was based on rules of logic or “measures according to which the Torah was expounded,” as they were called in the Talmud. There were seven rules defined by Hillel.
We may assume that Hillel did not invent these seven rules (or measures) without a definite foundation. These rules were employed before him. But when Hillel analyzed the method of interpreting the texts of the Torah that was employed by his predecessors, he discovered that the interpretations and expositions of the previous scholars followed a definite system of logical rules.
Hillel established seven rules but his successors increased the number of these rules. Rabbi Ishmael defined thirteen; Rabbi Eliezer the son of Rabbi Jose Hagalili identified as many as thirty-two rules.
Hillel’s seven rules of logic for interpreting the Torah are as follows: 1) <span dir="rtl">קל וחומר</span> — argument from minor to major and vice versa. 2) <span dir="rtl">גזרה שוה</span> — argument by analogy. 3) <span dir="rtl">בנין אב</span> — a standard passage serving as a basis for interpretation. 4) <span dir="rtl">כלל ופּרט</span> — general and particular limitation of the general by the particular and vice versa. 5) <span dir="rtl">שני כתובים</span> — standard from two passages — a decision involving two laws having a common characteristic is applied to other laws having the same characteristics. 6) <span dir="rtl">כיוצא בו ממקום אחר</span> — like that in another place — explanation of one passage according to another of similar content. 7) <span dir="rtl">דבר הלמד מענינו</span> — definition from context.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">Of the traditional reverence in which these rules were held we learn from a statement in the Talmud which says: Thus spoke God. And if one says all the Torah is from heaven except this minuta or this argument from minor to major or this argument, by analogy he has not accepted the Torah, (Sanhedrin, 99). Our scholars therefore believed that all interpretations of the Torah which were derived from its exposition, including those innovations which ranking scholars of the future will introduce, are as law handed down to Moses from Mount Sinai.</i>)
Hillel employed these rules of logic for the first time in his argumentation with the men of Bathyra. Later these rules continued to be used by other scholars in the same manner.
Hillel’s first rule — Kal vachomer — argument from minor to major and vice versa—implies that the accepted interpretation of a law of minor importance may be applied to a law of major importance when the latter is in doubt: This rule is generally applied in order to establish a more severe interpretation of a doubtful law. Sometimes, however, it may also be used to limit the restrictions of a doubtful commandment.
According to our scholars there exist ten examples of in the case of Joseph’s brothers when they were accused of stealing the beaker from Joseph’s house. They said: “The silver which we found in our sacks we returned to you from the land of Canaan and how shall we steal from the house of your lord silver or gold.” Their reasoning implied that if they took the greater trouble to return silver from the distant land of Canaan they would not stoop to steal. A statement of Moses serves as a second example of a “Kal vachomer.” Moses said: “Even when I am with you today you disobey God, what will you do after my death?”
When Hillel stood before the men of Bathyra discussing whether the offering of the Paschal lamb supersedes the Sabbath he argued as follows: “If the daily sacrifice, the non-offering of which is not punishable by death, supersedes the Sabbath; the Paschal lamb, the non-offering of which is punishable by death, certainly supersedes the Sabbath.
Hillel’s second rule—argument by analogy—employs the comparison of the text of one law to the text of another in order to apply the interpretation of the first to the latter. But the Talmud states that a person may use this rule only to substantiate an interpretation but not to abolish one.
An example of argument by analogy occurs when the Talmud tries to establish that the commandment “an eye for an eye” is not to be taken literally although the biblical text states “If one shall cripple his neighbor, as he did so shall be done to him.” The Talmud argues that in another case involving a man whose ox gored his neighbor’s ox the Bible enjoins that the man shall “pay an ox for an ox.” From this the Talmud deduces that “an eye for an eye” also implies that monetary compensation shall be given to the victim.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא פּ״ד א׳.</span></i>
The Jerusalem Talmud indicates how broadly the “argument by analogy” may be employed by stating: “Whenever the text of the law is not clear that law may be substantiated from other texts.”
Hillel also employed this rule in his argumentation before the men of Bathyra. He said: “The commandment to offer the daily sacrifice employs the word <span dir="rtl">במועדו</span> (in its appointed time), so does the commandment to offer the Paschal lamb. Since the daily sacrifice supersedes the Sabbath we must conclude that the Paschal lamb offering does so as well.”
The rule <span dir="rtl">גזרה שוה</span> could also be called the rule of comparison and the Talmud does say that it is possible to “compare and to derive an argument by analogy.” But the rule of comparison later became differentiated from argument by analogy.
The Gzerah Shavah was derived from the Torah which compares differing instances in order to cast light from one on the other. Thus in the case of the rape of an engaged girl which took place outside of the city the girl is not to be punished for it because it is assumed that she called for help but no one came to her assistance and the case is compared to that of a person being murdered.
The third rule of Hillel — <span dir="rtl">בנין אב</span> — concerns a subject whose text is expressed in a general manner, and from this text decisions are deduced concerning other subjects which are not mentioned in the Torah.
The name <span dir="rtl">בנין אב</span> means “paternal structure” because the expounder is like a father and the pupils are like children. This appellation also indicates that his rule is like a building in which one large stone is supported by numerous smaller ones.
Whenever we find subjects in the Torah, which are similar to one another in content or in some other characteristic which is clearly defined in one instance but is not definite in the other cases, we interpret all doubtful texts according to the clearly established one and we compare this one to a father whose influence extends over a wide range of texts and binds them into a family unit.
The fourth rule — <span dir="rtl">כלל ופּרט</span> — involves a general law whose specialized interpretations explain the doubtful phases of its generality.
We already mentioned that one of the causes of Hillel’s coming to Palestine was his desire to ascertain whether a man who underwent purification required the statement of a priest to establish that fact or whether the purification procedure was sufficient in itself. Hillel came to the conclusion that since in the case of the cure of a “Nethek” the Bible states “he is clean,” which is a generalization, which statement is later followed by the words “the priest shall purify him,” which is a specification, it is impossible to understand the generalization without the specification. The specific therefore comes to elucidate the general that the man is not clean until he is declared so by the priest.
The fifth rule is <span dir="rtl">שני כתובים</span>.	This concerns two contradictory texts such as those affecting the offering of the Paschal lamb. One of them states “and you shall slaughter the Pesach to your God, sheep and cattle” while another text says “from the sheep and from the goats you shall take it.” Hillel therefore did not know what animal should be offered for the Passover sacrifice until he elucidated this matter by the aid of a third text which states “take for yourself sheep for your families and slaughter the Pesach.” He explained it to mean sheep for the special Passover sacrifice, and sheep and cattle for the general feast day offering.
Similar to the above was Hillel’s explanation of another set of contradictory texts about which he was at first confused and came to Palestine to seek elucidation. One text which says “six days you shall eat Matzoth” is contradicted by another stating “seven days you shall eat Matzoth.” He interpreted it to mean that one must eat Matzoth made out of the new grain (garnered after the Omer) for six days and on the seventh day one should eat Matzoth made out of old grain.
The sixth rule — <span dir="rtl">כיוצא בו ממקום אחר</span> — involves the explanation of a word in the text of one law by another law which may be entirely unrelated.
The seventh rule — <span dir="rtl">דבר הלמד מענינו</span> — governs the interpretation of a doubtful part of one subject from the text of the same subject.

Shammai, Hillel's Colleague

A<small>FTER</small> H<small>ILLEL BECAME</small> N<small>ASI</small>, a man named Menachem was chosen to head the court. Very little is known about Menachem but the Talmud relates that he, together with eighty “pairs” of his disciples, left the temple after they received gifts from the king and, donning royal atire, they entered the king’s service.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה ט״ז א׳.</span></i>
What impelled Menachem to take this step is also a mystery. Some scholars hold that he was forced to do so against his own will. Josephus tells that Menachem at first belonged to the Essenes and, when Herod was still young, he predicted that he would become king. When this prediction came true Herod remembered him and treated him graciously.
If this account is true, then it is possible that Herod persuaded Menachem that his life and career will be safer if he leaves the temple and engages in royal srvice. Menachem was convinced and he was succeeded by Shammai. It is also unknown how long Menachem collaborated with Hillel; but this relationship must have been of short duration since he left no impression and no words of his are mentioned anywhere.
The Talmud characterized Shammai as an angry man in contradistinction to Hillel who was noted for his modesty and patience.
Every non-Jew who wanted to embrace Judaism on certain conditions, and whom Hillel did convert, first visited Shammai. But Shammai was angered with them because of the conditions which they imposed, and in one case the dispute developed into a physical struggle. But this tendency to anger on the part of Shammai must not be interpreted as a sign of an evil nature, for whenever he realized that his opponent was right he gladly conceded it. Shammai once had a dispute with Jonathan b. Uziel, a disciple of Hillel, who did not spare Shammai in the course of the debate. When Shammai became convinced of the justice of Jonathan’s arguments, he conceded his defeat and only complained of the insults which his opponent heaped upon him.
The best indication of Shammai’s character is contained in his advice that every man should be received in a friendly manner. But some historians interpret this as an attempt to rid others of that weakness from which he could not rid himself.
Shammai studied under Shemaiah and Abtalion together with Hillel. But it appears that he headed an academy soon after the death of Shemaiah and Abtalion and before Hillel started an academy of his own. Whenever the two academies (the House of Shammai and the House of Hillel) are mentioned in the Talmud, the “House of Shammai” is usually listed first,
Shammai was very extreme in his piety. He held the Sabbath to be the most important day of the week in anticipation of which every Jew must prepare even as one would prepare for the reception of a prince. Beginning on Sunday, he would therefore search for the best things and reserve them for the Sabbath. He never permitted good food to be served at his table on a week day unless he had better food prepared for the Sabbath.
It was accepted at that time that children should not fast on the Day of Atonement. It was customary for fathers to wash one hand on that day in order to offer food for their children. But Shammai refused to do this because of the prohibition against washing on the Day of Atonement and permitted his small child to fast. When other scholars realized that the child’s life was in danger they forced Shammai to feed the child with both hands. It also happened that Shammai’s daughter-in-law gave birth to a son on Succoth. Shammai thereupon removed the roof of the house and covered the balcony overhanging the mother’s bed with green branches so that the new-born son may not be outside of a succah.
It is apparent from Shammai’s behavior that he was careful to observe all the minutae of the commandments. It is also evident that he did not interfere with the political situation in the country and devoted himself solely to the interpretation of the laws in which he was seldom in agreement with Hillel. Hillel sought broader vistas in his exposition while Shammai clung to the literal meaning of the text even in those cases where logic indicated that it should be interpreted otherwise. Hillel sought the causes underlying the laws and critically analyzed previous interpretations before he arrived at his own conclusions.
In time these differences between the disciples of Hillel and Shammai increased and it seemed as if there were two Torahs instead of one, for the claims of one school were invariably contradicted by the other. This opposition reached such a state that on one occasion all the people were prohibited from leaving the academy on pain of death until a decision would be made whether Hillel or Shammai was the correct exponent of the law. “This day,” the Talmud states “was as difficult as the day on which the golden calf was made.” The Talmud makes no mention of the results of that day but on another occasion it relates that after many years of dispute a “voice” announced that both contending sides are correct but the law is according to the teaching of Hillel. It is told that one of the later Tanaim (Rabbi Tarphon) repeated the Shema in the manner that Shammai prescribed and soon after that he was beset by robbers. The scholars thereupon told him that he deserved to be in that danger because he deviated from the law of Hillel.
Most of the differences of opinion between the two schools centered about the laws pertaining to sacrifices, tithes and the rules of purity. Some sharp clashes also arose in problems of marriage which one school permitted and the other school prohibited. It might have been expected that differences of opinion on this subject would lead to accusations of illegitimate birth. But this was not the case since both schools were tolerant toward each other and their disciples intermarried freely.
But in spite of the strictness of Shammai he nevertheless had the interests of the people at heart. Whenever he realized that it was impossible to enforce a certain stricture he overlooked it and advised waiting for a more favorable time to introduce it.
The laws pertaining to the Sabbatical year were frequently ignored at that time. While no one sowed his fields on that year, in accord with the literal meaning of the Torah, many people nevertheless permitted themselves to plow their fields in anticipation of next year’s planting because the law does not explicitly prohibit plowing. This procedure was similar to that of preparing food on a holy day for consumption on a week day and many people expected Shammai to prohibit it. But Shammai said: “If the times were to permit it I would decree against the sowing of fields which were plowed on the Sabbatical year.”
From these words of Shammai it is evident that the reason why he refrained from issuing such a decree was the fact that Herod did not allow interference with the farmers because of the income which he derived from them. Were it in his power, Herod would have abolished the Sabbatical year but he feared to tamper with a law that was commanded by the Torah. He limited himself to forcing the scholars to issue such decrees regarding the cultivation of fields on the Sabbatical year as would least interfere with the work.
One of the main differences between Hillel and Shammai involved the question of “Semichah,” the placing of hands on a sacrifice. The Torah commands a man “to rest his hand” on the sacrifice which he offers, and this was interpreted to indicate that the penitent must participate in the slaughtering of the sacrifice. Since such a procedure involves a considerable effort a dispute arose as to whether one has to do so on feast days and on the Sabbath. One school absolved the penitent from this procedure while the other maintained that without it the sacrifice was not valid.
Shammai and Hillel founded two schools of interpreting the Torah according to which they decided all religious problems. While basing themselves on the same texts and on the same traditions which they inherited from Shemaiah and Abtalion they nevertheless arrived at contradictory conclusions in nearly every case.
Up to the time of Hillel and Shammai all disputes carried a party character. The opposing sides—the Sadducees and the Pharisees—held differing points of view and everyone could readily understand the origin of the disputes. With Hillel and Shammai the disputes assumed an inner party nature. This was a new phenomenon since both of them belonged to the Pharisees in whose ranks peace prevailed until that time. Only in the matter of “Semichah” was there any difference of opinion; complete unity was the rule in all other questions. It is therefore surprising that the disputes between Hillel and Shammai developed in intensity until the abyss between them became ever greater and more ominous.
Hillel, as was related previously, had eighty disciples. Thirty of these were deserving to have the “Schechinah” rest upon them even as it rested on Moses. Thirty deserved to have the sun stop in its course for their sake just as it did for Joshua. Twenty were intermediate men. The least of Hillel’s disciples was Rabbi Jochanan b. Zakkai of whom it was said that “he was familiar with all the nooks of the Torah, the Mishna, the Gemara, the Halachot and Agadot and the minutest interpretations of the Torah and of the Soferim. He understood all the mysteries of “Gematrio” (numerical evaluation), the language of the angels and of the evil spirits, the language of the palm trees as well as many fables of apes and foxes.” When the Talmud lists the praises of the disciples of Hillel it is with the intention of showing what a learned man the greatest of them must have been if the least of them, Rabbi Jochanan b. Zakkai, was so well versed.
The names of two of Shammai’s outstanding disciples have come down through history, and of them it is told that in spite of their training in the school of Shammai they believed that all laws should be observed according to Hillel’s interpretation. One of these was Rabbi Jochanan of Hauran and the other was Baba b. Buta.
Baba b. Buta was blinded by Herod during the latter’s extermination of the sages. Later Herod repented and asked Baba b. Buta, what he could do to atone for his misdeed. Baba b. Buta is described as being a pious man who daily offered a sacrifice to atone for any possible sin that he may have committed.
In connection with the name of Baba b. Buta a story is told of a man from Babylon who settled in Jerusalem and married there. But the language of the Jews of Babylon was different from that of the Jews of Palestine, despite the fact that they all spoke an Aramaic dialect, and the wife of this man could therefore not understand what he was saying. Once he commanded her to bring him “two butsinis”, when he meant to ask for two water melons, and she brought two candles instead. (The word <span dir="rtl">״בוציני״</span> meant water melons in Babylonian and candles in the Palestinian dialects.) Angered at her misunderstanding, the man commanded his wife to “go break them on the doorstep.”<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">זיל תברי יתהון על רישא דבבא.</span></i> This was a customary remark in Babylonia, when one was brought something he did not want. The woman believed she was told to break the candles on Baba’s head and did so. (“Resha d’baba” means the head of the door and also the head of Baba.) Baba was not angered and merely asked her why she did that. The woman told him that she was commanded to do so by her husband, whereupon Baba said to her: “Because you obeyed the will of your husband God will give you two sons who will be like Baba b. Buta.”
The differences of opinion between the “House of Shammai” and the “House of Hillel” lasted until the destruction of the temple. After its destruction the name of the “House of Shammai” practically disappeared. According to the Talmud<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין י״ג בי.</span></i> this dispute continued till the days of Rabbi Gamaliel of Jabneh who was five generations removed from Hillel. He convoked all the scholars of his time to Jabneh and there they decided by vote whether the opinions of the school of Shammai or those of the school of Hillel should be enforced. The debate lasted three years until a “Bath-kol” (a divine voice) announced, that the opinions of both schools are from God but that the law is according to Hillel.
The disciples of the school of Hillel endeavored to lighten the burden of the law in imitation of the ways of Hillel who was the personification of modesty and kindliness. In many instances they sought to find better ways for man to follow. It was customary at that time to dance before the bride during the wedding and to praise her virtues in order that the bridegroom may appreciate her qualities. Hillel insisted that a bride should be praised for her beauty even when she was not beautiful in the same manner that one praises an article which another bought even when one realizes that it was not a good buy.
The school of Hillel paid particular attention to the moral and spiritual consequences of every law. The law of that time said that a girl who was married before she was of age could not reject her husband after she became of age. But the school of Hillel maintained that if the girl was an orphan and was married off by her mother or brother, she could reject the husband that was chosen for her before she was old enough to choose for herself.
Similarly in the matter of “Yibum,” in the case of a man who dies childless, the man’s brother has to marry the widow. If he refuses to do so he has to grant her “chalitzah.” In such a case the widow had no choice. The school of Hillel tried to modify this law to allow for cases where the widow refuses to marry her deceased husband’s brother. They ruled that if the woman claims to have taken a vow during her husband’s lifetime never to have any dealings with her husband’s brother, then the court must force him to release her from his claim although legally her argument remains that he refuses to marry her. If the widow took such a vow after her husband’s death, then the court should request the brother of the dead man to forego his right and to grant “chalitzah” to the woman.
The school of Hillel modified the law permitting divorce in a similar fashion. The school of Shammai allowed the granting of a divorce only on the grounds of the wife’s infidelity. Any other complaint of the husband about the physical or spiritual unfitness of the wife was considered insufficient ground for divorce. The school of Shammai held the bond of matrimony to be sanctified by divine powers and no human agency could release it except by express command of the Torah. But the school of Hillel maintained that the morals of society and the happiness of humanity would be improved if man were allowed to divorce his wife for any undesirable traits which he may find in her.
The school of Shammai never deviated from the literal meaning of the text of a commandment while the school of Hillel always studied the possible intentions of the text first and only later did they issue their edict according to reason and for the betterment of humanity. For these reasons the school of Shammai always decreed the law in its severest interpretation while the school of Hillel tended to lighten the burden whenever possible.
The political situation of the Jews of Palestine was a very difficult one. The country was in constant turmoil due to the foreign and civil wars. But the greatest calamity occurred when the country lost its independence and became a Roman province under the rule of a governor who could dictate the material as well as the spiritual life of the country. There then developed a party of patriots which openly or secretly opposed Rome. This party inscribed in its program that God is the sole ruler of the Jews and they said: “Woe to the nation which chooses a man to rule over it.”
Historians claim that this party consisted primarily of the followers of the school of Shammai. The followers of Hillel were also dissatisfied with the political situation but they did not believe in revolutionary propaganda and they attacked the enemy by means of laws against those people who aided the Romans in collecting taxes from the Jews. They held that it is difficult for “Gabaim” (treasurers) and “Mochesim” (tax collectors) to repent their sins because they are like robbers and it was forbidden to receive from them any contribution for charitable purposes. Despite all this, the followers of Hillel accepted their fate realizing that there was no force which could avail against Rome.
The attitude of the followers of Shammai was entirely different. These openly opposed the Romans. At a gathering held in the house of Chananiah b. Ezekiah eighteen political questions were debated and the opinions of the followers of Shammai prevailed. But these decisions were not written down and in later years it became impossible to determine what they were.
We must bear in mind that the followers of Shammai were revolutionaries and this meeting probably took place during the days of Agrippa the first when the patriots were preparing for a struggle with Rome. Fearing that the Romans may attack this meeting they arranged it so that it should be possible to claim, in case of attack, that it was not a political meeting but merely a gathering to discuss religious questions.

Akabia ben Mahalalel

N<small>UMEROUS INDICATIONS</small> in the Talmud suggest that during the life time of Hillel and Shammai there lived other spiritual leaders who followed an individual method in interpreting the Torah and who did not identify themselves with either of the above. Some of these are mentioned by name on a number of unimportant occasions. Others did not even attain this recognition.
Akabia ben Mahalalel was one of the scholars who developed an individual method of exposition. We possess but vague knowledge of his life and activities. One report states that he was excommunicated without naming the sin for which he was thus punished. But this report is immediately contradicted and it is said that whoever invented such a slanderous rumor about a saintly man such as Akabia was, deserves severe punishment.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עדיות פרק ה׳ משנה ו׳.</span></i>
Considering all references to Akabia ben Mahalalel in the Talmud one must conclude that he was an unusual man who was gifted by nature with great perseverance. The nation was then engaged in a great struggle to preserve its independence against outside enemies and was rent by an internal conflict over the observance of the Torah. In such a time Akabia ben Mahalalel succeeded in remaining above the inner and outer struggles and in maintaining his neutrality toward the contending sides.
So far as we know, Akabia ben Mahalalel did not hold any official position. In religious questions he contributed his opinion on only four subjects which are of such rare occurrence that a century may pass before such problems present themselves again. Since his point of view differed from that of the other scholars and he expressed his opinions with a certain disrespect for the leaders of a previous generation he was therefore excommunicated.
The original source of the four laws on which Akabia ben Mahalalel held dissenting views we find in the above mentioned Mishna. One dealt with special cases of leprosy, the other law concerned a woman who has an issue of blood, the third dealt with the wool shed by a clean first-born animal that was crippled, and the fourth concerned a woman suspected of infidelity who was a proselyte or a freed woman.
The first two laws come under the category of legislation pertaining to cleanliness and impurity and their interpretation involves medical considerations. We will, however, devote a few words to the third and fourth laws.
The first born of a clean animal had to be sacrificed in Jerusalem according to the prescribed custom for minor holy offerings (<span dir="rtl">קדשים קלים</span>).	As long as such animal lived, one was not allowed to put it to work nor to shear its wool. In case such an animal became crippled it had to be slaughtered and given to a priest. As stated above, it was prohibited to shear the wool of such a first born animal, nor could the wool be utilized after it was slaughtered. But Akabia ruled that the priest was entitled to the use of that wool which the animal shed while it was still alive, while the other scholars disagreed with him.
The fourth law about which Akabia held a dissenting opinion concerned a “Sotah”. (Sotah is a woman who is suspected by her husband of infidelity.) The prescribed procedure in such a case was for the husband to bring the wife together with an offering of barley meal to the priest. The priest took a clay vessel filled with pure water and placed in it some earth from the temple; he then wrote the verses of the Torah pertaining to a Sotah on a paper and read them to the woman after which he washed the ink from the paper with the water which he gave to the woman to drink. If the water caused the woman no harm it was held as proof that she was innocent.
Akabia held that this procedure need not be applied to a Sotah who was a proselyte or a freed servant. In attempting to dissuade him, the scholars cited the case of Shemaiah and Abtalion who gave the water to a Sotah who was a freed servant. Akabia retorted that “they gave it to one like themselves.”
The exact meaning of the words of Akabia is not clear. (The Hebrew word “dugma” means similar.) They are interpreted to indicate that Akabia was of the opinion that Shemaiah and Abtalion did not give the woman the prescribed water to drink nor did they write the prescribed passage. They merely attempted to influence her psychologically in order to obtain the truth. But some scholars thought these words to be a slurring reference to the origin of Shemaiah and Abtalion and they placed him under the ban. When Akabia died the people stoned his casket.<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">This story of the Sotah who was a freed woman is also related in Berachoth, 19. In commenting on it, Rashi states that when Akabia said <span dir="rtl">״דוגמא השקוה״</span> he referred to the fact that Shemaiah and Abtalion were proselytes and they therefore considered the freed servant equal to a Jewish woman and did give her the prescribed water.</i>
But the statement of one, Rabbi Jehudah, elsewhere referred to as Rabbi Jehudah of Bathyra, is immediately quoted to the effect that one must not believe that a just man like Akabia could have been put under the ban, nor could he have slandered the names of Shemaiah and Abtalion in the case of the freed servant. Whoever assumes that Akabia was excommunicated is deserving of punishment. Rabbi Jehudah maintains that the matter of the excommunication crept in through an error and involved another person named Elazar ben Chanoch who was put under the ban because he ignored the commandment of “washing hands” in the belief that this commandment was not implied in the Torah.
The respect in which Akabia was held by the Jews can be seen from the fact that he was offered the position of the head of the Court if he would recall his decisions in the matter of the four above mentioned laws. But Akabia answered: “I would rather be called a fool all the days of my life than be wicked in the eyes of God for one hour or that people should point at me and say that I betrayed my convictions in order to obtain an office.”
These four laws concerned subjects so rare that a court may have had no occasion to pass on them throughout its existence. We also find that later scholars held the same opinions as Akabia held.
We must also bear in mind that immorality was very widespread in the Judea of that day and the whole procedure of trial of a woman suspected of infidelity was done away with. The Biblical text, “the woman shall be a curse within her people,” was interpreted to apply only in case the people lead moral lives.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי סוטה פרק ט׳ הלכה ט׳.</span></i> There is therefore some doubt whether Akabia passed on these questions or whether his decisions caused any serious opposition.
Before Akabia died he instructed his son not to observe these four laws according to his interpretation.
His son asked him: “Why then did you not recall your decisions?” Akabia answered: “I have heard them adopted by a majority and my opponents heard their views adopted by a majority. For this reason I clung to the law as I heard it and they observed it as they received it. But you heard the decisions from me, who am but one, and from my opponents who are many. It is therefore better that you give up the opinions of the individual and abide by the opinions of the majority.”
On this occasion Akabia’s son also asked his father to instruct his colleagues that they should treat him better, but Akabia answered that he would not speak to them about this matter. His son then asked him: “Have you found any evil in me?” The father answered: “I have seen no evil in you but I believe that intercession will not help you. Your own deeds will make you beloved among people and your own deeds will make them stay away from you.”
The editor of the Mishna in “Pirke Aboth” cites the following maxim in the name of Akabia ben Mahalalel: “Keep in view three things and you will not come to sin.” Expounders interpreted these to be that a man should refrain from pride and sinful desires. Akabia stated further, “Know whence you came, whither you go and before whom you have to give strict account. Consider how you came into the world, remember that you are bound for a place of dust and worms and that you will have to give account before the King of kings, the Holy one bless be He.”
In a somewhat different form we find this passage quoted in “Aboth d’Rabbi Nathan”: “Akabia ben Mahalalel said: ‘He who ponders the following four subjects will sin no more. Think of whence you come, whither you are going, what will become of you, and who will be your judge. Whence you come? From a place of darkness. Whither you are going? To a place of darkness. What will become of you? Dust and worms. Who will be your judge? The King of kings, the Holy one bless be He.’”
Some people claim that the request to Akabia to recall his four opinions did not refer to the above described decisions concerning cleanliness and impurity, the wool of a first born crippled animal and a Sotah who was a proselyte but rather to those four maxims which he held that a man must take to heart in order to be saved from sin. These teachings placed Akabia in the category of one who spreads ideas that are dangerous for the world. By having people think constantly of death and of the sufferings in their grave, their desire to live is undermined.
It was then that he was called upon to revoke the four maxims which deprive people of the desire to live and he would be appointed head of the court. However, it is difficult to explain how it could happen that a man who was under the ban for following an original system of interpreting the law should be considered a desirable candidate to head the Court.
But this explanation is not based in fact, for it seems evident that Akabia was excommunicated, despite the denial of Rabbi Jehudah ben Bathyra. In the Talmud we find a passage of a later date which seriously poses the question why Akabia was not executed, as was the law regarding a “dissenting elder,” if he really ridiculed Shemaiah and Abtalion. The answer given to this question was that Akabia’s words regarding a Sotah who was also a freed woman had only a theoretical implication and were not meant to be taken as a law to be practiced.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין פּ״ח א׳.</span></i>
The time of Akabia’s life has not been definitely established. It is certain that he lived after the death of Shammai in whose stead he was to be appointed as head of the court. When Akabia refused this office, it was thenceforth abolished.

Rabbi Gamliel the Elder

H<small>ILLEL WAS SUCCEEDED AS</small> N<small>ASI</small> of the Sanhedrin by his son Simeon. The office of Nasi assumed added importance after the office of “Head of the Court” was abolished and the Nasi became the sole ruler in all religious questions.
But it seems that Simeon did not live very long. He is only mentioned in the Talmud as Hillel’s successor and no teaching of his has been recorded. When Simeon died his son Gamliel was elected Nasi. Gamliel came to be known as Rabban Gamliel the Elder and he was the first one to be titled “Rabban.”
The title “Elder” was conferred upon Gamliel because he was the first scholar of that name. The title Rabban (our teacher) was conferred on him because he was the only Head of the Sanhedrin. At that time there was introduced the custom of “Smichat Z’kenim,” ordination of the elders, during which the Nasi or his representative ordained one of the disciples by placing his hand on his head. This procedure conferred upon the disciple the title Rabbi and the right to judge in all disputes except those involving life and death which were then the prerogative of the Roman government.
Most of the time that Rabban Gamliel served as Nasi was unfavorable for the Jews, only one short period of improvement intervened. These were the last years preceding the destruction of the temple and the country was in a state of constant crisis. Officially the land was a province of the Roman empire and was ruled by the iron hand of a Roman governor. Even the slightest disobedience to the governor’s will was punishable by death.
In those days Christianity began to spread in the country. The Apostle Paul (Saul of Tarsus) claims to have been a disciple of Rabban Gamliel. If this claim is justified, then the trial of Jesus must have taken place during those years.
During that time too the Sanhedrin left the stone chamber in the temple and moved to “Chanuth,” a place in Jerusalem outside of the temple. The cause of this transfer of the Sanhedrin probably lay in the realization that the political situation of the country was rapidly approaching a crisis. If the temple could not withstand the enemy, it was aimed to save the Sanhedrin at least.
Almost at the same time the throne of Rome was ascended by the mad Ceasar Caligula who demanded that all the nations of the empire accord him divine worship. He also commanded the Jews of Palestine to place his image in the temple.
This command was received on the eve of the festival of Succoth when Jews from the whole country were gathered in Jerusalem for the festivities. Their joy immediately turned to mourning and every one felt certain that the royal decree would not be fulfilled for the whole nation would rise against the attempt to desecrate their sanctuary. Under the prevailing political situation it was obvious that such a rebellion against the emperor’s command would cost the lives of tens of thousands of people.
One of the scholars then present in Jerusalem addressed the people and said: “Let not the festivities of this day be disturbed. God in Heaven will save us from Caligula’s decree even as he delivered us from other such decrees in the past.”
His prediction came true and before this decree was executed Caligula was slain. With the death of the emperor this decree was abolished. Another political factor was influential in this case although its influence was exerted secretly.
The Jewish prince Agrippa, the son of the executed prince Aristobulus who was the son of Miriam the Hasmonean, was educated in Rome where he was very friendly with Caligula. He once exclaimed that he wished emperor Tiberius was dead so that Caligula could ascend the throne. When this remark was reported to Tiberius he had Agrippa put in prison. A short time later Tiberius died and Caligula freed Agrippa from his imprisonment. In spite of the intrigues of his sister, who was also a grandchild of Miriam the Hasmonean, Agrippa was made ruler over several districts of the old Jewish kingdom. In addition to this Caligula offered to fulfill any wish of Agrippa which lay in his power. Agrippa asked that the decree to have an image of the emperor installed in the temple be revoked. Although Caligula was displeased by this request, he agreed to postpone the execution of his decree; meantime he was assassinated.
After Caligula’s death, Agrippa utilized his influence with the Roman senate to have Claudius named emperor and Claudius showed his gratitude by naming Agrippa king over the whole land of Judea. Agrippa ruled for seven years which marked a bright period in the life of the Jews of Palestine.
In contradistinction to his predecessors, Agrippa strove to observe all the laws of the Torah in the same manner as they were observed by the common people without requesting any royal privileges. But despite this there were many who were dissatisfied with the king. The behavior of previous kings was fresh in the memory of the people and many Jews felt that it would be better if there were no king.
One of the scholars said to the king that he was not worthy to cross the threshold of the temple because he built a “theater” in Cesarea according to Roman custom. Agrippa did not punish the man but had him taken to a performance in Cesarea to convince him that the performances were not against the Jewish faith. Another time the king was accused of not being a full blooded Jew, since his grandfather (Herod) was an Idumean convert, and also of not being raised in the Jewish faith.
Once when king Agrippa was standing on the platform in the temple during the festival of Succoth and was reading the king’s portion of the Torah (Deut. 17) he reached the verse “you shall not make a stranger who is not your brother king over you.” He then remembered the accusation that was levelled against him that he was not a pure Jew and he began to weep. The scholars felt a great pity for their weeping king and they said to him: “Fear not king Agrippa, you are our brother.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה מ״א א׳.</span></i>
King Agrippa was very much attached to Rabban Gamliel. He obeyed his advice in all religious matters and Rabban Gamliel was his guest on all festive occasions.
Many of the king’s regulations aimed to make peace between the Jews and non-Jews. The Roman administration attracted many non-Jews to Palestine and these considered themselves privileged citizens because they enjoyed the direct protection of Rome. The Jews, on the other hand, believed themselves to be the more privileged because of their being natives of the land. Agrippa endeavored to establish friendly relations between the two and in this Rabban Gamliel aided him. It was then that they permitted the non-Jewish poor to come to glean the fields together with the Jewish poor, and they ruled that it was obligatory to give charity to Gentile and Jewish poor alike. Similar rites were prescribed for the dead of both peoples.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ס״א א׳.</span></i>
Agrippa reigned for seven years. In spite of his attempt to gain the favor of Rome he secretly sympathized with all those who dreamed of freedom from the Roman yoke. During the last days of his life he tried to ascertain the number of men that the Jews could raise into an army. He convoked all the Jews of the country to Jerusalem for a census. The census was made by means of the Paschal offerings which they brought. The High Priest hid a part of every offering and the number was found to be six hundred thousand. This was proof that there were six hundred thousand families in Palestine aside from those who could not come to Jerusalem because they were impure or because of the distance. Since every family consisted of an average of ten people it was accounted that the Jewish population of the country numbered over six million people.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים ס״ד א׳, תוספתא פּסחים פרק ד׳.</span></i>
At that time king Agrippa went to Caesarea to witness a theater performance and while in the theater he began to suffer great pain. He was immediately removed to his palace where he soon died at the age of fifty-four years.
Rabban Gamliel died soon after. With his death, the scholars said, there departed the glory of the Torah and all justice and purity passed away.
Of the innovations of Rabban Gamliel there were some of great importance for his time. He introduced a new procedure in taking testimony regarding the beginning of a new month. When it was necessary to hear such testimony on a Sabbath, the witnesses were kept in a place called “Beth Yazek” and they were not permitted to leave the place all day because of the Biblical prohibition that “no man shall leave his place.” Rabban Gamliel amended this law to permit one to walk two thousand ells in every direction from the point at which one found himself. He permitted a similar liberty for midwives on their way to women in labor, in case of fire, attack by a foreign army and flood.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה כ״ג ב׳.</span></i>
Up to that time two witnesses were required to testify to the death of a man before the widow was permitted to remarry. But as the cases of violent death increased as a result of executions by the Romans as well as through murder on the highways Rabban Gamliel ruled that just as only one witness was required to validate a marriage even so only the testimony of one witness to the death of a man should be sufficient to permit the widow to remarry.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות קכ״ב א׳.</span></i>
Aside from these innovations Rabban Gamliel introduced other rules pertaining to divorces and other important occasions in the lives of the people. In all of these regulations he aimed to lighten the burden of the laws. Only in those laws which pertained to cleanliness was he more severe than his predecessors. He also introduced various customs which placed the Nasi in a privileged position as compared to that of the common people.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שקלים פרק ג׳ ופרק ו׳.</span></i>
Rabban Gamliel was a person of delicate health. He was not strong enough to stand during his studies, as was then customary, and he permitted sitting down during study for teacher as well as for pupils.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה כ״א א׳.</span></i> Although he was rich, he commanded his followers that he be buried in a plain linen shroud; this was contrary to the custom of the rich of that time. Since that time the custom of luxurious burial for important people was given up.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ז ב׳, כתובות ח׳ ב׳.</span></i>
The following saying of Rabban Gamliel characterizes his opinion of his disciples: “There are as many types of disciples as there are varieties of fish; there are unclean fish, clean fish, fish from the Jordan and fish from the great sea. A disciple who comes from poor parents and who, although he has studied Torah, Mishnah, Halacha and Hagada, has no native intelligence is like an unclean fish. A disciple who comes from wealthy parents, has studied Torah, Mishna, Halacha and Hagada, and also has native intelligence is like a clean fish. One who has studied Torah and Mishna and can also expound Halacha and Hagada but is not intelligent enough to solve problems that are put before him is like a fish from the Jordan. Like a fish from the great sea is a disciple who has studied Torah and Mishna and can also expound Halacha and Hagada and can solve all problems put up to him.”
From Rabban Gamliel we discover for the first time why the Sanhedrin declared some years to contain thirteen months. In a letter which he sent to the Jews of Palestine and the neighboring countries he said: “The time of Pesach is drawing nigh but there is no sign of spring and we will not have lambs for the Passover offering nor young pigeons to be sacrificed by women who have given birth nor will there be new barley for the offering of the sheaf.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין י״א ב׳, ירושלמי מעשרות פרק ה׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>
It also seems certain that the great academy of Jerusalem was transferred to Jabneh during the time of Rabban Gamliel. In Jabneh it remained for many years after the destruction of the temple with the permission of the Roman government.

Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel

W<small>ITH THE DEATH OF</small> K<small>ING</small> A<small>GRIPPA</small> the political situation in Palestine took a turn for the worse. The Roman governors oppressed the people until life became unbearable. Meantime Rabban Gamliel the Elder died and he was succeeded by his son Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel who found himself in a very difficult position throughout his stay in the office of Nasi. He would have liked to continue the tradition of his forefather Hillel as a seeker after peace but it became impossible to witness the barbarities of the Roman rulers and to maintain one’s peace and even less so to attempt to pacify the people.
The party of the zealots grew from day to day and a life and death struggle against the Romans developed. The Nasi could no longer maintain a position of a neutral bystander. The political situation demanded that he declare himself in sympathy with one or the other of the contending sides. At first Simeon came out against the zealots and their bloody struggle but realizing later the justice of their cause he joined the patriots and personally participated in many of their warlike endeavors.
Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel became Nasi seventeen or eighteen years before the destruction of the temple. The great gathering of scholars which took place in the home of Hanania ben Hezekia, which was mentioned before, took place in his time. Fearing that the Romans would attack the gathering they prepared a number of religious questions which had to be clarified in order to be able to say that this was not a political meeting but only a religious disputation.
In his religious conduct Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel observed his family tradition of making the laws of the Torah as easy to observe as possible. He evinced a certain tolerance toward the Sadducees who, since the days of Simeon ben Shetach, were looked upon as non-Jews by the Pharisees. He also believed that the religious burden imposed upon the people should not be greater than that which they were willing to accept.
Had Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel lived in another period his spiritual development might have followed a different line. Raised in luxury and reverence he was certain to have become an enthusiast of beauty and it is hard to evaluate how much of the “beauty of Japheth” he might have introduced into the “tents of Shem.” Thus it is told that he once saw a beautiful Gentile woman and, although it was the accepted custom among Jews not to express admiration for the beauty of a gentile woman he could not restrain his wonder and exclaimed: “God, how wonderful is your creation.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה כ׳ א׳.</span></i>
He sometimes performed gymnastic feats which no one could imitate. During the “Simchat Beth Hashoeva,” the festive ceremony of the pouring of water, he threw into the air and cought again eight burning torches without their touching one another in the air or in his hands. When he bowed during prayer he elaned on two fingers and kissed the ground and rose again without any assistance.
A characteristic expression of his beliefs we find in Pirke Aboth where he says: “All my days I have spent among the scholars and I have not found anything better than silence and not study is the chief thing but action and whoever speaks much causes sin.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק א׳ משנה י״ז.</span></i>
To gain a better understanding of his words we must bear in mind that among the Jews outside of Palestine, as in Alexandria, the opinion was current that the study of the Torah had only a theoretical value since it deals with the theories and not with the practical observance of the laws. But it is probable that he aimed to make the people understand that the struggle against the Romans must be carried on in a more practical manner, less discussion and more actual struggle.
Meanwhile the struggle against Rome became more intense. The Romans brought blood and fire into the land and the Jews adopted the same means. The peace loving elements of the population were annihilated. Some were killed by the Romans and others lost their lives at the hands of the patriots. There also occurred bloody clashes with the non-Jews living in the country and the Idumeans, who largely gave up the Jewish faith which they embraced five generations earlier, and joined forces with the enemy. The Samaritans (Kuthim) also evinced their violent hatred of the Jews.
The one time converts and friends of the Jews sought to benefit from the Roman-Jewish struggle and their attempts still further increased Jewish suffering. The struggle was bitter and each of these enemies sought the total annihilation of the Jewish people to which the latter responded in kind.
The wealthier Jews sided with the Romans. They had no occasion to feel the slavery, and the anger of the governors but seldom descended upon them. The Roman administration treated them gently and granted them numerous privileges as collectors of the taxes to induce them to get the maximum out of the impoverished population. But these wealthy elements had no understanding for the privileges of their class. Many of them devoted themselves to the study of the Torah, observed all the laws and honestly contributed their tithes. But they were characterized by a love for money which led to violent mutual hatreds among them.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי יומא פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
The Sanhedrin lost most of its authority. Since it lost the power to pass sentence in matters affecting life and death. The people had no fear of it and felt free to disregard its commands. Immorality and excesses became prevalent even in Jerusalem. People from low social strata were elevated to high positions and previous notables lost their influence. The wealthy spent their money on excess food and drink and immoral practices saying: “Why save for the morrow? Man should afford himself all possible pleasures, for if he will not spend his wealth the Romans will take it away from him.”
Robber bands spread throughout the land and it meant certain death to travel the highways without military escort. In these bands there were both Jews and non-Jews and they attacked travelers irrespective of their nationality. Only armed caravans and large Roman detachments could offer them any resistance.
There also came into being an organized band of people who employed small daggers which they conveniently hid under their robes. This band called itself Sicarii. They mingled among the people of Jerusalem and listened to the conversations and whenever one expressed an opinion favorable to the Romans, he would be stabbed while the assailant easily made his escape.
The most difficult task was to preserve peace during the Passover. Jews came to the city from all over the country to celebrate the feast day and among the pilgrims there also came many of the thieves and robbers. The crowds congregated in the streets in an attempt to see and to be seen. The Roman governor of the city was empowered to maintain order and he stationed soldiers about the temple. On one occasion one of the soldiers committed a nuisance against the wall of the temple and the enraged crowd fell upon him and killed him. When the other soldiers attempted to save him the crowd attacked them and the governor had to call the whole army to subdue the disorders. The narrow streets of Jerusalem, which were crowded with one and a half million pilgrims, became a field of slaughter in which about ten thousand Jews lost their lives in one day.
On another occasion Jews attacked the slaves of the governor while those carried gold and food for the soldiers; they killed the slaves and robbed them of all their possessions. The governor thereupon ordered the destruction of all villages about Jerusalem. This command was carried out and everyone whom the soldiers met on their way was killed. During one of these clashes a Roman soldier seized a scroll of the Torah and trampled it in the dust after which he burnt it exclaiming that he trampled and burnt the Jewish God. For this act he paid with his life to the enraged mob but as a result of it hundreds of other Jews lost their lives.
The Samaritans also rose against the Jews. Their temple on mount Gerizim had been destroyed a long time before and the majority of them observed Judaism very scrupulously. But the age-old hatred against the Jews continued to burn within them. When the people of Galilee wanted to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem they had to pass through the Samaritan villages. On their way they were attacked and slaughtered. This act was followed by a reprisal on the part of the inhabitants of Jerusalem who killed every Samaritan they could find and burned their villages. Then the Roman governor stepped in to punish the avengers and he executed several thousand Jews.
Meanwhile Claudius died and was succeeded by Nero. He granted some powers to the Jewish prince Agrippa, the son of the benevolent Agrippa who lived in the time of Rabban Gamliel the Elder. But the rule of Agrippa II was limited to part of the Galilee including the city of Tiberias and to twenty-four villages on the eastern bank of the Jordan. Agrippa had the power to appoint the High Priest as he chose and he utilized this right extensively. The office of the high priesthood could be bought for money and whenever a new candidate offered more for the position he was immediately appointed and the previous high priest was deposed. Money was the only consideration and the candidate for the office did not even have to be a descendant of Aaron.
Only one High Priest of that time is mentioned by name, Ishmael ben Phabi, but even he was not held in esteem. The broad masses of the people had no reverence for any high priest of that time, and of Ishmael ben Phabi it was told that he cruelly oppressed the people through his servants.
The people commonly believed that the high priests employed magic to rid themselves of one another. A poet of that time composed a verse with a list of the injustices which the people had to suffer from their high priests. It reads: “Woe is me from the house of Boetus and woe from their course; woe is me from the house of Kathros and woe from their pen; woe is me from the house of Ishmael and woe from their fist. All of them are high priests, their sons are tax collectors, their sons in law are overseers of the temple, and their slaves beat the people with rods.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים נ״ז א׳.</span></i>
When Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel came to the conclusion that the struggle against the Romans was justified and that as Nasi of the Sanhedrin he had to stand in the forefront of the revolt, he sharply condemned the activities of Josephus (Joseph ben Gurion Hacohen) who was entrusted with the leadership of the revolt in Galilee. From the first moment Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel believed that Josephus was not a capable military leader and he also suspected that Josephus would surrender to the Romans on the first occasion. Josephus himself relates of this distrust but says nothing against his opponent.
It is entirely reasonable to suppose that a man such as Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel was, did not die a natural death during a revolutionary period and many are of the opinion that he was killed. But some historians claim that he was not killed by the Romans but that he fell at the hand of the “patriots” who doubted his devotion to the revolutionary cause. “Megilat Taanith” only mentions the day of his death, 25th day of Sivan, and that he was killed together with rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha, High Priest.

Rabbi Chanina, Deputy of the High Priest, and His Contemporaries

D<small>ESPITE THE FACT THAT</small> J<small>UDEA WAS CONVULSED</small> by the last agonies of political death throughout the fifty years preceding the destruction of the temple and in spite of the brutal yoke of the Roman empire which did not allow the Jews to breathe freely, the study of the Torah nevertheless did not decrease during these years of crisis. Outside the enemy spread terror and thousands of patriots gave up their lives in the attempt to destroy him, but within their homes the people devoted themselves to study and ignored the dangers which beset them.
The Romans did not yet realize then how the study of the Torah might influence and encourage the patriotism of the nation. It therefore did not occur to them to hinder the pursuit of learning. Only after the destruction of the temple did it dawn upon them that the Jews find strength and consolation in the Torah. Before the destruction, the Roman political leaders were convinced that the temple was the only stimulus to Jewish rebellion and the same belief was held by the Jewish sympathizers of Rome. The Roman empire therefore concentrated all its efforts against the temple and not against learning.
Aside from the Nasi and his followers there were tens of other scholars who delved into the Torah and they exerted a great influence on the life of the people. Among the most important of these scholars was Rabbi Chanina, deputy of the High Priest.
A “deputy of the priests” was a person whose duty it was to stand beside the High Priest during the service on the Day of Atonement. Deputies were appointed for a long period of time and they maintained their office even while High Priests were being changed. There were usually several deputies at the same time but only one of them prepared to act as Assistant to the High Priest. If for any reason something happened to the High Priest, which prevented him from continuing the service, the deputy stood ready to take his place. But so long as the High Priest could perform his duty, the deputy merely stood beside him and was not allowed to do any of his work.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">רש״י יומא ל״ט א׳.</span></i>
The title “Sgan” (deputy) is the equivalent of overseer. The deputies were assistants of the High Priest and overseers and superintendents of the temple who were ready to help the High Priest whenever necessary.
Rabbi Chanina (sometimes referred to as Chananiah) was one of the outstanding scholars during the last days of the second temple. When the patriotic movement at first became active, Chanina identified himself with the peaceful elements of the nation who openly condemned the patriots. He then said that people should pray for the welfare of the government, for were it not for the fear of government people would swallow each other alive.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק ג׳ משנה ב׳.</span></i> On another occasion he highly praised peace and compared it in importance to the work of creation.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ספרי פּ׳ נשא.</span></i>
But later, when the conduct of the Romans became more murderous, Chanina joined the party of the patriots together with the Nasi, Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel. He then openly criticized the wealthy Jews who abandoned the rule of God for the rule of man, for “whosoever considers the words of the Torah is absolved from the fear of the sword, from hunger, from evil desires and from the rule of man as the Torah says: ‘Because you have not served God joyfully and wholeheartedly when you had enough of everything you will have to serve the enemies, which God will send upon you, in hunger and in thirst, naked and abandoned by everyone.’ Such a man will want to eat a piece of barley bread and he will not find it but at the same time he will have to give his enemy good bread and fat meats; he will thirst for a drop of vinegar or beer and will not find it but his enemies will demand the best of wines and he will have to supply it to them; he will want to wear a cloak of wool or flax and will have none but his enemies will demand from him the best of silks and he will have to give it to them. Thus he will remain forsaken by all without a candle, without a knife and a table and even without a pinch of salt.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק כ׳.</span></i>
It is told that Rabbi Chanina inaugurated special privileges for his office even as Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel did. As long as the temple was in existence he was the highest authority in all matters pertaining to sacrifices. Frequently he supported his opinions by citing the customary procedure of his father and the customs of his father were based on family traditions.
He was particularly interested in preserving the detailed memory of all the customs of the service in the temple. Believing that the temple would soon be rebuilt he wanted to be sure that the customs in the new temple should not differ from those in the old one.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים י״ד א׳, גטין כ׳ ב׳, זבחים פּ״ד א׳.</span></i>
Chanina, deputy of the priests, influenced Jewish life in other ways aside from temple service procedure. In his time there lived in a village near Jerusalem a man who loaned money. This man was in the habit of writing the note of loan himself and the borrower merely signed the note or attested to his signature by a witness. Rabbi Chanina declared these notes to be valid although the accepted law of the time stated that the borrower must write the note himself. Chanina believed that as long as the signatures of the witnesses to the transaction were authentic it mattered not by whose hand the note was written.
The life and influence of Chanina occurred during the last years of the second temple. He also stated that during his performance of the service various miracles took place. One of them concerned the Menorah that was lit but once a year on Rosh Hashana but continued to burn throughout the year.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מדרש תנחומא פּ׳ תצוה פּיסקא ג׳.</span></i>
Because of the mourning for the temple Chanina held that as long as it was in ruins no one should bathe on Tisha B’Av, not even a person who has to perform an ablution, but in this he was contradicted by other scholars.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ביצה פרק ב׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i>
The name of Chanina is not mentioned among the martyrs but the opinion prevails that he was executed and the date of his death is said to be 25 Sivan, the same as that of Simeon ben Gamliel and Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha. This does not mean, however, that he was killed before the destruction of the temple, for it is known that he survived it. It merely indicates that the date of his death coincides with that of the two martyrs.

At about the same time there lived two Tanaim whom the Jerusalem Talmud refers to as the “judges of robberies” and the Babylonian Talmud calls the “judges of decrees.” This contradiction, however, is easily explained by the difference in pronounciation in the two countries.
It was the duty of these judges to settle various disputes and to punish those whom they found guilty of robbery. They also considered cases of damages and the infliction of minor wounds. These judges were generally elected by the community which also paid their fees in order to avoid their being bribed by one or another of the contending parties. Their verdict was final and they had the authority to enforce it.
There were many such judges, for Jerusalem alone counted 394 courts, each of which had 25 judges, according to the Talmud. But the Mishna names only two judges whose decisions served as a basis for future verdicts. These two were Admon ben Gadai and Chanan ben Avi Shalom.
The rule which these judges followed in arriving at a decision was to consider the specific circumstances of the place and time. We must also remember that of all the sentences passed by these judges not one involved actual robbery. They concerned financial disputes and the judges gave their verdict according to the dictates of reason. Scholars of later date used these decisions as a basis for passing sentence.
Admon ben Gadai issued seven sentences, four of which became a basis for future law although they were based on reason and not on texts of the Torah. Chanan ben Avi Shalom contributed two decisions in the same spirit.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ק״ה ב׳.</span></i>
* * *
Mention should also be made of Joshua ben Gamala who was elected High Priest several years before the destruction of the temple. This office he obtained through bribe in spite of the fact that he was not even descended from priests and that he married a widow. Martha, the daughter of Boetus, married Joshua and in order to obtain the office of High Priest for him she sent a bag full of gold to king Agrippa the second.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא י״ח א׳, יבמות ס״א א׳.</span></i>
During the last rebellion Joshua ben Gamala opposed the patriots and was against the war with Rome. Agrippa soon removed him from office, as was his custom with High Priests, and Joshua remained a member of the Sanhedrin. When large numbers of Idumeans came from Galilee to Jerusalem to seek refuge from the Romans, Joshua ben Gamala together with the High Priest Anan strongly opposed their admission into the city. But the majority of the inhabitants of the city opposed their will and when the Idumeans were finally admitted they attacked Joshua ben Gamala and the High Priest Anan and killed them.
Joshua ben Gamala was very rich and he spent much money to beautify the temple and to increase its vessels. It is told that he had a golden vessel made for the purpose of casting the lot to determine which of the two sacrifices was to be offered in the temple and which was to be sent to Azazel.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא ל״ז א׳.</span></i>
Despite the fact that Joshua ben Gamala bought the office of High Priest, the Talmud mentions his name favorably, because he ruled that there must be teachers in every city in Judea to instruct the children so that the Torah might not be forgotten.<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">The story of the manner in which Joshua ben Gamala became High Priest is related by Josephus and is verified on two occasions by the Talmud. But the Talmud states that Martha gave the bribe to Jannai instead of to Agrippa. This is due to the fact that aside from Agrippa I all the kings who ruled during the second temple are referred to in the Talmud as Jannai. Tosephoth remarks that it could not have been Alexander Jannai, the brother in law of Simeon ben Shetach, because the latter was High Priest himself and would never consent to give this office to another. There still remains some doubt as to the identity of Joshua ben Gamala because of the inconsistency that the man who “saved the Torah from being forgotten among Jews” should stoop to buy the high priesthood for money. It is for this reason that many historians claim that we are dealing with two different personalities. Rashi and Tosephoth (Baba Bathra, 21) maintain that it is one and the same person.</i>

The Time of the Destruction of the Temple

F<small>ROM THE PREVIOUS CHAPTERS</small> we get a clear picture of the political situation of the country and of its inhabitants as well as of the means that were employed by the enemy to oppress the people. But the internal life of the Jewish home was not greatly affected by the war which raged outside its walls. All those laws and customs which governed the life of the people were already strongly established to the smallest detail; the regulations concerning the daily prayers and the observance of the Sabbath and the holy days were definitely formed. The same was true regarding the family organization, the permissible and prohibited marriages, financial disputes among Jews as well the punishment of offenses against the public order. There were also well established dietary regulations and rules of cleanliness. All customs regarding offerings to the priests and the obligations toward the poor were defined. Even questions pertaining to the offering of sacrifices, which many scholars no longer considered as the most important foundation of the Jewish faith, and the laws affecting life and death, which were taken out of the jurisdiction of the Jewish courts, were codified in great detail together with their traditions and forms. But all of this legislation was not yet written down and the people had to guard it in their memory for use in future interpretations of the law.
We may therefore definitely say that the whole “oral law” as we have it today was already completed by that time. Such disputes as arose over the interpretation of a text came about as a result of the fact that the law was not set down in writing and was contained in the memory of the students.
In the observance of every day customs each one had his own traditions and these varied only slightly. But the regulations regarding cleanliness and the laws pertaining to the offering of sacrifices, which was no longer practiced, were increasingly disputed as time went on. Many of the regulations pertaining to sacrifices were forgotten soon after their offering was discontinued and it frequently occurred that a later scholar who never witnessed the service in the temple had to correct an older scholar who did witness the service but whose recollections were indistinct.
A rule was therefore adopted that whenever one expressed an opinion about a practice which was no longer observed, such an opinion had only a theoretical significance as to the desirable form of the observance but it did not serve as proof that this had actually been the form in which the practice was observed in the past.
Laws affecting civil disputes which involved monetary matters attained a high level of development. This was especially the case in the matter of offering proof which assumed numerous forms depending on the nature of the case; at times it was necessary to bring witnesses, at other times an oath, a written document or other proof of possession was required.
Usually two witnesses were required in such law suits. Their testimony had to coincide and they had to be known as men of high moral standards. For this reason no “Am Haaretz” was eligible to be a witness nor a person who might be suspected of falsifying his testimony out of fear of one of the litigants or through irresponsible levity. Women, children, cripples (blind and deaf) and fools who cannot judge what they see were also ruled out as witnesses. Similarly relatives of the litigants were rejected and in case both witnesses were related only one of them was allowed to testify. Persons known as “wicked,” gamblers, pigeon thieves and usurers were ruled out because they were considered as robbers who deprive people of their money. The same was true of persons who dealt in fruit of the sabbatical year or who were suspected of robbery. Among those not qualified to testify were also included tax collectors for the Roman government, shepherds who graze their herds in strangers’ fields and people suspected of being personally interested in the case.
There were cases when the court had to be satisfied with the testimony of only one witness. Thus the testimony of one witness to the death of a person was sufficient to free the widow to remarry. In other cases where the plaintiff could produce only one witness, the defendant could swear to his innocence and thus invalidate the testimony. Similar was the case of a woman who came before the court in times of peace and declared that her husband was dead. If she was known to have lived happily with him her testimony was accepted as valid in spite of the fact that women were not allowed to testify and despite the rule that no one might testify on his own behalf.
When hearing a witness the court had to impress upon him the possible significance of his words and to cross question him minutely. If the witnesses contradicted each other the testimony of both was ruled out. If they recanted their testimony, they were considered as false witnesses and the punishment that was to be meted out to the defendant was imposed upon them. In some cases it was possible to convict a defendant on the basis of testimony of witnesses who did not see the crime themselves but who heard of it from the defendant. But there were also limitations such as that a man might not be convicted on the basis of his own confession even though such a confession was worth the testimony of a hundred witnesses, for no man could make himself out to be wicked.
An oath was exacted when there were no witnesses or when only one witness appeared against the defendant. Similarly watchmen who disclaimed responsibility for damages to property while in their charge had to take an oath. This was also the case when a defendant admitted part of his guilt or one who denied guilt and was confronted by one witness. There were also cases when the plaintiff had to take an oath. These included workmen who claimed that they were not paid, the victim of a robbery in a case where the defendant pleaded not guilty, and the case of a man who was suspected of falsehood but against whom there were no witnesses.
The best proof in a law suit was a written document atesting to a loan, an engagement, a marriage or a divorce. Other documents recognized were contracts of sale or purchase, wills affecting inheritance, certificates of gift, receipts, mortgages, evaluation of property during the division of an inheritance, certificates of alimony to a deserted wife or children, written declaration of a married minor rejecting her husband, statements of arbitration and numerous others. Sometimes an oath was required in addition to the written documents whenever the signatures on the latter were doubtful.
Circumstantial evidence was highly regarded. Property in possession of a person was considered to be his own and any claim to it had to be proved by the claimant.
[The people were at that time imbued with a strong desire to fortify and define their faith and it is remarkable that, in spite of the unfavorable political position of the Jews, Judaism nevertheless gained adherents and many neighboring peoples came closer to it. It may be assumed that the period was one of spiritual crisis among the heathen nations. Tiring of the idols many people confusedly speculated that the forces of nature are not gods but that they are part of an invisible power which governs the forces of nature. When they heard that Jews worship such an invisible God, many came to Judea to acquaint themselves with the worshippers of this God.
It was characteristic that the seekers after a new truth mainly belonged to the upper educated strata of their nations. Adiabene, a small buffer state on the banks of the Tigris, was then ruled by a queen Helene. This queen was married to her brother Izates, and after his death she once visited Jerusalem. Deeply impressed by what she saw and especially by the religious ceremonials of the temple she was converted and adopted Judaism. Later her son, Izates II, also joined the faith.
It is probable that some of the Jewish scholars of that time were not too happy over the new converts. It seems certain that the strict regulations against proselytes and the sharp expressions against them in the Talmud such as that “proselytes are as difficult for Jews as a swelling” all date from this period. The troubles which Jews had to withstand from the Samaritans and the Idumeans taught them to be careful in admitting new converts.
Most of the proselytes of that time were women. Conversion was more difficult for men and fewer of them adopted Judaism. When king Izates II decided to become a Jew one of the scholars taught him the precepts of Judaism and told him that he must not undergo circumcision in order not to arouse the anger of his countrymen; it would be sufficient if he recognized the principles of the Jewish religion and the overlordship of an invisible God. But Izates was later circumcised when he realized that without this rite he was deprived of the rights of a Jew.
Many highly placed persons strove toward the Jewish faith. They were intrigued by the high moral teachings of the Jewish religion although they did not highly regard the Jew as a person. It therefore seems certain that were the political situation of the Jewish nation more favorable all the surrounding nations would have embraced Judaism.
It is also remarkable that some of the scholars of that time were but little concerned with the continued existence of the temple. Many events which then transpired were not written down and those that history did note express a definite tendency of thought. But it seems certain that some scholars considered the development of the Torah as more important than the maintenance of the temple. They probably reasoned that were the temple to be destroyed it could be rebuilt in more auspicious times but if the Torah were to be neglected it might spell the doom of the Jewish nation.
It is also evident that some scholars did not attach much importance to the offering of sacrifices while others carefully pondered the minutest details of the temple service. This, however, took place after the temple was destroyed. Only after the temple was razed did the realization of its significance as a central national force dawn upon people. Only then did even those who considered the temple to be of minor importance in the Jewish religion grasp its importance. Revolutionary sentiment died down after the rebels were slaughtered or led captive to Rome to fight with wild beasts in its arenas. A new concept of the significance of sacrifices was then gained. It was now understood that when the text says that sacrifices are offered as “pleasing odors” it was not meant that God enjoys the odor of burnt flesh but rather that he is satisfied to see men do his will. When it was no longer possible to offer sacrifices, some scholars held that fasts and self-inflicted suffering are considered by God to be worthier than burnt offerings while others maintained that prayer was of greater importance than sacrifices.
While the revolution was raging throughout the land the temple service was conducted as usual. At the same time, many scholars sought to escape from the revolution-torn city and they established a new sanctuary for the study of the Torah in Jabneh.
The Romans did not yet persecute the study of the Torah, for in those days they did not see in the Torah any danger to the unity of the Roman empire. They therefore paid no attention to the scholarly pursuits as long as the Jews regularly paid their taxes to the government. It also seems certain that the Romans would have saved the temple from destruction were it not for their allies among the Jews who constantly called their attention to the fact that as long as the temple remained in existence Jews would never submit to Roman rule and no matter how much they were persecuted they would continue to revolt.
Among the friends of the Romans who constantly insisted that the temple must be destroyed and that its continued existence gave encouragement to the embattled Jews, the foremost were the Jewish king Agrippa II and his sister Berenice. Berenice was not noted for modesty in her personal life and she became the mistress of Titus, the commander of the Roman army in Judea.
The relations between Titus and Berenice are described in the Talmud in the following words: “He held a harlot by the hand and entered the Holy of Holies.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין נ״ז ב׳.</span></i> Just as the Talmud never referred to Herod except as “the Idumean slave” so also they referred to Berenice as a “harlot.”
Historical legend relates that Titus commanded his soldiers not to harm the temple. But Agrippa and Berenice refused to obey him in this matter and hinted to the soldiers that they would never subdue the revolt as long as the temple remained intact. Berenice is said to have climbed on the shoulder of a Roman soldier and with her own hand to have thrown into the temple the burning torch which set fire to the building. When Titus heard that the temple was burning he ran to help put out the fire, but he came too late, for the flames had already enveloped the whole temple.
It is obvious that one would not sin against historical truth if he disbelieved this legend. It was originated by Josephus who is not entirely trustworthy when chronicling the role of Titus and king Agrippa during the destruction of the temple.
The revolt lasted many years. It was not concentrated in one locality but flared up in different sections of the country until it assumed a general nature and on a certain day the priests refused to offer the daily sacrifice for the welfare of the Roman emperor and also rejected sacrifices offered by non-Jews who lived in Judea.
Friends of the Romans immediately informed the representatives of the government of the new turn in the tactics of the rebels. When Roman soldiers were dispatched to enforce the offering of the sacrifice for the welfare of the emperor and to force the acceptance of the sacrificial offerings of the non-Jews, the patriots occupied the temple and killed many of the soldiers who were stationed in Jerusalem and its vicinity.
This action caused great confusion among the Jews because it was unauthorized and many prominent persons in Jerusalem publicly expressed their displeasure. For this expression of loyalty to the Romans the zealots executed many of them as well as numerous others whom they suspected of secret sympathy with the Romans.
Later others declared that since the deed could not be undone it was necessary to wait for the reaction of Rome, meanwhile fortifying the cities in anticipation of the coming of the enemy.
At that time there lived in Jerusalem three wealthy men who belonged to aristocratic families which could trace their descent as far back as king Saul and Moses. Their names were Nakdimon ben Gurion, Ben Kalba Savua and Ben Tzizith Hakeseth. These three undertook to supply the city with wheat and barley, wine and oil as well as salt and wood for the duration of the siege of Jerusalem even if that were to last many years.
But the zealots were eager to come out in open struggle against the Romans and they felt sure that they were strong enough for the contest. They feared that the presence of large supplies of food during the forthcoming siege might induce the people to stay within the walls and discourage them from attacking the enemy outside the gates. They were therefore dissatisfied with the offer of the wealthy men and in the dark of night they burned the store rooms filled with grain. A great famine then followed the like of which the city never experienced before.
The Roman governor meanwhile incited the Greek population of Caesarea against their Jewish neighbors. When the news of the clash became known, the Jewish inhabitants of Jerusalem attacked the Greeks as well as other non-Jews within the city. This mutual enmity quickly enveloped the whole country and whenever Jew and non-Jew met a battle ensued in which the weaker side was given no mercy.
These clashes spread to Acco, Haifa, Ascalon and other cities and also affected the Jews of Alexandria in Egypt who till this time lived peacefully. When the news reached Alexandria the Greek population began to attack the Jews and, meeting with resistance, they started a war of annihilation against them. The leader of the Greeks was a Jewish apostate Tiberius Alexander.
The chronicles of these violent events speak of tens of thousands of people being killed. While it is possible that some of these figures are exaggerated there remains no doubt that large numbers perished and the horrors of the situation were not exaggerated.
When the Romans finally decided to suppress the Jewish insurrection their army was put under the command of Galus. With him was the Jewish king Agrippa who acted as his guide and who instructed the soldiery to execute all those they met.
Meanwhile the disturbances within Jerusalem gained in intensity from day to day. Outside the cities the Jewish warriors showed feats of prodigious valor which terrified the Romans to such an extent that many of them deserted their camp and joined the Jews in the struggle for liberation. But within Jerusalem there raged a violent struggle between those who wanted peace and the militants who demanded war.
The story in the Talmud about the disputes between the school of Shammai (who wanted war) and the school of Hillel (who wanted peace) of which it is said that “a sword was placed within the temple and it was announced that one might enter but he might not leave until a decision was arrived at”<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת י״ז א׳.</span></i> is interpreted by some historians to refer to the above mentioned conflicts. On another occasion it is told that “the disciples of Shammai stood at the foot of the wall armed with swords and spears and they beat the disciples of Hillel.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שבת פרק א׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>
Still others campaigned for war by means of the written word. There was then written the “Megillat Taanith” which cites all the afflictions which Jews had to withstand throughout their existence in order to arouse the people against the insufferable troubles. Others wrote “Megillat Beth Chashmonai,” the story of the Hasmonean family, which told of the causes of the Hasmonean revolt in order to remind the people of the great miracles which then transpired when a small handful of valiant Jews undertook the struggle against the mighty Greeks. All of this was aimed to encourage the rebels in the belief that God would certainly aid them against the Romans even though their military forces be small.
The greatest error of the leaders of the war against Rome was committed when they appointed Josephus to head the war in Galilee. In his history of the war Josephus relates the tricks and intrigues to which he resorted in his fight against the insurrection up to the destruction of the temple. After the destruction he received an appointment from the Roman emperor and out of gratitude to Rome he assumed the surname Flavius which was also the name of the emperor Vespasian and his son Titus.
To save the situation the Romans dispatched a horde of six hundred thousand armed men under the leadership of Vespasian against the Jewish rebels. Vespasian, who was noted for his victories over the Germans, proceeded to storm the fortresses outside of Jerusalem in an attempt to cut off that city from all avenues of escape. He was always successful in utilizing the aid of traitors who informed him of the weaknesses of the various cities and how they might best be taken. His conduct of the war lacked all ethics of combat and whenever he occupied a city after promising to spare its inhabitants, he invariably broke his promise and brutally slaughtered its residents.
The Jews fought with indescribable heroism but they were everywhere betrayed and the Romans took one city after another. Jerusalem alone remained steadfast and would not surrender but it was afflicted by another difficulty. Tens of thousands of refugees from the surrounding towns fled into the city and attempted to dictate the activities of its inhabitants. A large portion of the Jerusalem population would have been glad to end the insurrection in any manner possible, but the zealots considered them as traitors and once a man was stamped by the suspicion of treason he could be killed without punishment.
The mutual conflicts of the Jerusalem Jews as well as the famine which broke out after the food supplies were burned were a great encouragement to Vespasian who saw in them a sign that the gods were favoring him. Secure in the belief that Rome would triumph in the end, he was satisfied to watch the Jews aid him in his work.
Vespasian meanwhile entrusted the conduct of the war to his son Titus who maintained friendly relations with king Agrippa II and with Josephus and was also on intimate terms with princess Berenice. These instructed him what means to employ and, knowing that the city was without food, they pointed out to him how he could also cut off its water supply. When these attempts brought no results, Titus announced to the besieged that he would provide food and drink to all those who would come out to him and that he would also permit them to return to the city.
Many of the besieged were deceived by these promises and, as could be expected, Titus did not keep his promise. Some of the deserters were given salty food but no water; others were crucified in front of the fortress in full view of the besieged; still others had their arms cut off after which they were sent back into the city.
But in spite of the siege the temple service continued until the 17th day of Tamuz. Throughout long months the inhabitants of the city had nothing to eat but the daily sacrifice was offered until the last lamb was gone and not even a handful of flour was left in the city. Then the sacrifice was discontinued and the fire on the altar expired.
With the aid of famine and plagues, mutual conflict and other suffering which reached such a stage that the people were forced to become cannibalistic, the Romans conquered Jerusalem. But even when the Romans were already within the gates of the city the Jews continued to fight valiantly until they saw the temple in flames; only then did they lose their courage.
No one believed that God would permit His temple to be destroyed and, when this finally did happen, everyone within the city, men and women, young and old, went about crazed with despair. Thousands cast themselves into the fire while others fell on their own swords.
The burning of the temple marked a spiritual crisis in Jewish life. Their life became centered about the Torah and now Jerusalem was superseded by Jabneh.
After four years of bloody warfare Jerusalem lay devastated, the temple destroyed, the best people of the nation were killed or dragged into captivity where they were sold as slaves into the copper and lead mines. The young men of the aristocratic families were forced to run after the triumphal chariot of Titus while carrying in their hands the vessels of the temple which became the booty of the Romans and after the celebration of the triumph they had to face each other as well as wild animals in battles staged in the arenas of Rome for the pleasure of the populace.
These spectacles were visited among others by the ex-king Agrippa, his sister Berenice and Josephus who later described those wars in a tone of praise to Vespasian.
Jabneh developed into an important city during the revolt preceding the destruction of the temple. Its population was so large that the city provided forty thousand men for the war; it may therefore be reckoned that its population was about two hundred thousand. When the Romans spared the city they hardly knew the strength which was inherent in the Torah and how dangerous for them it might become.
It seems certain that many of the scholars left Jerusalem before the destruction of the temple because of their refusal to participate in the revolt. These settled in Jabneh which was apparently not affected by the tumult of war. When Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai visited the emperor Vespasian in his camp, he found favor in his eyes and Vespasian asked him to make a request. Rabban Jochanan did not ask that Jerusalem or the temple be spared but he requested that Jabneh and its scholars be saved. This clearly indicates that Jabneh was already then the home of a large number of scholars.
Jabneh then became the center of Judaism — a new Jerusalem without a temple or sacrifices. A new Sanhedrin was organized which assumed the rights of the previous Sanhedrin of Jerusalem to regulate Jewish life according to the interpretations of the Torah. The scholars of Jabneh were of no less stature than those of Jerusalem. They would not have been chosen had they not been men of great religious and secular learning as well as masters of the languages of the neighboring peoples, so as to be able to try cases between Jews and non-Jews without having to resort to outside experts and interpreters.
The scholars of Jabneh gathered in a place which was called “the vineyard of Jabneh.” The meaning of this name is not entirely clear and some claim that it refers to their manner of being seated in rows just as vines are planted in a vineyard.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ד׳.</span></i> In Jabneh the decision was finally made that in all disputes between the school of Shammai and the school of Hillel the law should be practiced according to the school of Hillel. This decision was arrived at as a result of a “Bath Kol”<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">Opinions vary regarding the exact nature of a “Bath Kol.” Some declare it to be a natural phenomenon, while others say it is an expression of the will of God. According to the first it is a reflection of popular opinion, a voice from among the people, while the latter say it is a voice from heaven. When the Talmud states that after the death of the last prophets (Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi) the Holy Spirit (Ruach Hakodesh) appeared no more and the “Bath Kol” took its place, Tosephoth remark that “some say they did not hear a voice coming from heaven but only an echo such as one hears reflected.” (Sanhedrin, 11.)</i> which announced that the opinions of the school of Shammai are also from God but that only the opinions of the school of Hillel should be put into practice.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק א׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>
When the people saw that sacrifices were no longer offered they fell into a great despair. Many of them could not understand the value of the prayers that were substituted for the sacrifices and the weaker ones joined the various religious sects that sought a new god outside of the Jewish faith. It was then that the Tana Shmuel Hakatan established the prayer against the disbelievers (<span dir="rtl">ברכת המינים</span>) which curses all those who depart from the Jewish faith to be taken from among the living.
Many laws were codified in Jabneh and special attention was paid to determining the first of the month and the feast days. This calendar was also valid for the Jews of Rome, Greece, Egypt and Babylon.
Jabneh thus became a place of refuge for fugitives from the strife in Jerusalem. While the tumult of war was still resounded and the hearts of the people contracted in pain at sight of the dead and wounded and at the sound of the Roman cheers, this group of scholars forged the essence of the Jewish nation. It was not difficult for them to find that which they sought. They realized that the Torah was the only hope for continued national existence and their work could not be hindered by strangers nor by all the legions of the Romans. While the enemy could kill people, destroy the temple and lay waste the land he could not annihilate the spirit of the nation.
After a short time there was also founded in Jabneh a court having the same powers as the court in Jerusalem. The text of the Bible that “if a thing shall be hidden from you in a judgment between blood and blood or between one claim and another or between one damage and another in a dispute within your gates, you shall arise and go to the place which the Lord God will choose” (Deut. 17:8) they interpreted to mean that the court gives authority to the place where it is located and not the place to the court; it was therefore concluded that Jabneh might also be such a place.
Jabneh came to be considered the equal of Jerusalem in the matter of some customs such as the blowing of the Shofar (ram’s horn) on Rosh Hashanah when the first day of the year happens on a Sabbath. In such a case it was previously prohibited to blow the Shofar on Sabbath outside of Jerusalem where no sacrifices were offered.
It is related that the introduction of this custom in Jabneh met with some difficulties. Prominent opponents of this measure, such as the men of Bathyra whose ancestors once headed the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem, could not compromise with the idea that Jabneh should be considered the equal of Jerusalem in sanctity and that the blowing of the Shofar on a Sabbath should be permitted within it. They wanted to debate the matter with Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai but he said: “Let us first blow the Shofar and then we shall debate the issue.” When they wanted to debate the question after this was done he said to them: “Now that the sound of the Shofar has been heard in Jabneh it is useless to debate the matter.”
Until this time it was the custom that the head of the Court had to announce the beginning of the new month but in Jabneh it was ruled that any member of the court might announce the beginning of the new month even in the absence of the head of the court.
The basis for these new innovations was that with the destruction of the temple the needs of the people changed in accordance with the new political situation. The great changes which the events of that time brought about eliminated the original purpose of many of the customs and they had to be changed according to the new state of affairs. It is characteristic of the people that they adapted themselves rapidly to the changed circumstances and looked at the present and toward the near future instead of to the past.
As the people devoted themselves to the observance of the commandments according to the traditions of the oral law, they gained the necessary strength to rise above the gloom of the present and to concentrate their thoughts on spiritual matters. Their first activity was to gather all the traditions and to put them down in writing. Seeing that many old customs were being forgotten and that even some of the scholars, who were active in the academy, sometimes forgot that which they had seen, they began to collect in book form all the traditional customs and laws including those that were no longer practiced after the destruction of the temple.

Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai

R<small>ABBAN</small> J<small>OCHANAN BEN</small> Z<small>AKKAI</small> played the most important role in the great spiritual crisis which took place during the time of the destruction of the temple. Since he was known to favor peace with the Romans, the zealots kept him under constant surveilance but, employing a trick, he succeeded in escaping the city together with two of his best disciples (Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua) and in persuading the Romans to spare the city of Jabneh together with the scholars that lived in it in order to permit the perpetuation of the customs of Judaism according to the regulations of the Torah.
This event is described in the Talmud in the following manner:
Abba Sikra, a nephew of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai, was a leader among the zealots. One day Rabban Jochanan summoned him to appear before him secretly. When Abba Sikra arrived, Rabban Jochanan asked him: “How much longer will you permit the people to die of hunger before you surrender to the Romans?”
Abba Sikra replied: “What can I do? Were I to mention peace to my comrades I would be killed.”
“Then advise me how I can leave the city. Perhaps I shall be able to bring some salvation for myself and for others,” Rabban Jochanan said.
To this Abba Sikra answered: “Pretend that you are sick and have people come to visit you. Afterward have it announced that you died but permit only your disciples to attend to the funeral and to carry your body out of the city, for strangers may become aware that they are carrying a living body.”
The advice of Abba Sikra was followed to the letter and when the pall bearers approached the gate of the city the guards wanted to pierce the body in order to make sure that it was really dead. But Abba Sikra said to them: “Do not so, for if the Romans hear of it they will say ‘The Jews have stabbed their Rabbi.’” The guards then wanted to throw the body from the litter and Abba Sikra again intervened saying, “Do not so, for if the Romans hear of it they will say ‘The Jews have thrown the body of their Rabbi on the ground.’”
Upon finding himself outside the city, Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai at once repaired to the Roman camp to see Vespasian, who was then conducting the siege of Jerusalem. After he gained his confidence with his wise words, and especially because Vespasian knew of his favorable attitude toward peace with the Romans, Vespasian asked him to request whatever he liked. Rabban Jochanan asked for three things: his first request was to spare Jabneh and its scholars; the second request was to spare the family of Rabban Gamliel the Elder; the third request was to provide a doctor for Rabbi Zadok who spent forty years in fasting and prayer to God to spare the temple.
On this occasion the Talmud remarks that sometimes God deprives the wise of their intelligence, for Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai should have asked that the Romans give up the siege. But the same paragraph which criticizes Rabban Jochanan also defends him by saying that he refrained from speaking about the siege for fear of gaining nothing if he asked for too much.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין נ״ו.</span></i>
The manner in which Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai came before Vespasian is related in a somewhat different manner in the Midrash.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">איכה רבתי פרק א׳ פּיסקא ל״א.</span></i>
According to this version the name of Rabban Jochanan’s nephew was Ben Batiach and it further states that when the zealots of Jerusalem burned the food stores which the three wealthiest men of the city gave to the inhabitants to tide them over the period of the siege, Rabban Jochanan Ben Zakkai cried in anguish. It was immediately reported to Ben Batiach that his uncle cried out “Woe” (Vai). Ben Batiach summoned his uncle and asked him: “Why did you cry out ‘Woe’?” But Rabban Jochanan replied: “I did not cry out ‘Woe’ but ‘Wah.’” (Wah, was an exclamation of joy.)
Ben Batiach further queried, “Why were you so glad?” To this Rabban Jochanan replied, “I was glad that you burned all the food supplies, for so long as there is food within the city you will not succeed in getting the people to participate in the war.”
Three days later Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai was walking in the street and he saw people boiling straw and drinking the broth. He then remarked that if people who boil straw to drink the broth attempt an insurrection against Vespasian and his army, it was best to leave the place.
He then sent to Ben Batiach a message saying: “Allow me to leave the city.” But Ben Batiach answered, “We have an agreement to permit no living person to leave the city.”
According to the Midrash Eichah, Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai did request Vespasian to give up the siege but Vespasian is said to have answered: “The Romans have made me emperor that I should destroy this land, but you may take out of the city all the friends that you wish to save from death.”
According to another legend, Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai once saw the daughter of Nakdimon ben Gurion, who was one of the three wealthiest men who undertook to provide the city with food before the zealots burned their food stores, picking barley from beneath the horses’ hooves. He then exclaimed: “When Jews do the will of God, no nation on earth can rule over them; but when they ignore the will of God, He hands them over to a lower nation, not only that, He even hands them over to its horses.”
“Aboth d’Rabbi Nathan” relates the manner of Jochanan’s leaving Jerusalem in a much simpler form. According to this source Rabban Jochanan simulated death and succeeded in escaping with the aid of his disciples only without his nephew being involved in it.
The origin and descent of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai remains unknown. For three generations the house of Hillel ruled the religious life of the Jews, and the people obeyed it because they considered it to be an offshoot of the royal house of David. Suddenly there appeared an outsider, who was held to be the least of Hillel’s disciples, and the whole people followed him. Many years before the destruction of the temple, people flocked from near and far to hear him expound the Torah. It was for this reason that Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai considered himself a representative of the nation and it was as such that he spoke to Vespasian.
In those days he was in the habit of sitting in the shadow of the temple and expounding the Torah, all day long, before an audience which was too numerous to be accommodated by the temple. The wall of the temple was one hundred ells high and it cast a broad shadow where many could find protection from the sun. Rabban Jochanan concerned himself but little with the brutal oppression of the Romans or with the terrible disputes which rent the Jewish parties. This was also his attitude years later when he taught in Jabneh after the destruction of the temple and he refrained from commenting on the political situation. The content of his teachings was devoted to peace and even during the days of the sharpest struggle he was not afraid to speak of the necessity for peace with Rome.
Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai was a pupil of Hillel. Since he survived the destruction of Jerusalem and was later active in Jabneh, there seems to be no exaggeration in the tradition which claims that he lived to be 120 years of age. It may also be said of him what was said of Moses that “his eyes were not dimmed nor did his freshness leave him.”
Hillel himself recognized the worth of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai. When Hillel became sick, before his death his disciples came to visit him, but Rabban Jochanan remained standing outside the door. “Where is the small Jochanan?” Hillel asked, and he then predicted that when Jochanan would grow up he would be “a father in wisdom and a father for future generations.”
It is told that even long before the destruction Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai understood that the Jews would not be able to withstand the Romans and that the temple would be destroyed in the end. A legend relates that forty years before, its destruction, the gates of the temple began to open by themselves as if ready to receive the enemy. Rabban Jochanan is said to have scolded them for their fear saying: “Everyone knows that you will be destroyed, but you do not have to open your gates to make the entrance of the enemy easier.”
Even before the temple was destroyed, Rabban Jochanan found himself a place named Arav (near Sepphoris) where he spent eighteen years, but in all this time he reached only two verdicts. He therefore concluded that the place was not adapted to the study of the Torah and he said that since Galilee hates the Torah it would in the ent revert to being a region of robbers.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שבת פרק ט״ו הלכה ח׳.</span></i>
With his great intelligence Rabban Jochanan grasped the whole Torah including all its interpretations, laws and legends; his every word was carefully weighed and he did not engage in idle conversation	.(<span dir="rtl">שיחת חולין</span>) He never walked four ells without speaking of the Torah or without phylacteries. While on the street he had a friendly greeting for Jew and non-Jew alike. He was the first to come to the academy and the last to leave it, nor was he ever seen sitting idly or asleep, but he always was engaged in study. He allowed no one to open the door of the academy for his disciples but he opened the door himself for every one and led each one to his place. He never said that it was time to go home except on the eve of Passover in order to slaughter the Paschal offering and on the eve of the Day of Atonement in order to prepare for the fast.
Of his master, Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai said: “If all the heavens were parchments and all the trees were quills and all the seas were ink it would still be impossible to write down even a part of what I learned from my teacher. And all this,” he would add, “is only as much as a fly might absorb when plunging into the great sea.”
But Rabban Jochanan did not consider his great learning to be a virtue deserving of praise. He was in the habit of saying: “If you have learned much, do not be proud of it. It was for this purpose that you were born.” He also said: “Whoever possesses wisdom without fear (of God) is like a craftsman without tools.”
He believed that the Torah protects from death, and when all the male offspring of a certain priestly family of his day died at the age of eighteen years, he declared that they must be descendants of Eli, upon whom there rested the curse of early death for all men. If, however, they would have devoted themselves to the Torah then its virtue would have protected them from the curse.
It is charactristic of Rabban Jochanan that he was not deeply influenced by the destruction of the temple. A legend relates that when he learned of its destruction he tore his clothes but when he heard his disciple Rabbi Joshua mourn: “Woe to us, the place that has brought forgiveness for the transgressions of the Jews has been destroyed,” Rabban Jochanan replied: “Do not be grieved for we have another means to attain forgiveness of our sins and that is through charity.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק ד׳ משנה ה׳.</span></i>
The great crisis, which the destruction of the temple marked in Jewish life, met with a different response among the two diametrically opposed elements within the nation. One group could not reconcile itself to the destruction; the essence of their faith was centered in the temple, and when that was burned they became obsessed with the idea that the whole nation was destroyed along with it. Unable to adapt themselves to the new circumstances, these renounced their lives or joined some of the outlandish religious growths which then cropped up profusely.
But there was another group which secretly nurtured its sorrow. These even felt certain that God would not allow the temple to remain desolate for long and they drew encouragement from the historical fact that the “Babylonian captivity” lasted only seventy years. They fervently believed that the predictions of the prophets regarding the future of Jerusalem and the renewal of the temple would certainly be fulfilled. But until a new temple should be erected they meanwhile introduced customs to take the place of the sacrifices; they devoted themselves to pondering the sanctity of the Jewish nation and delved deeply into the Torah and its interpretations.
Meanwhile death and destruction stalked the land. Not satisfied with the desolation of the land and the blood which they shed, the Romans daily introduced new laws to humiliate the Jews. Knowing that the Jews had taxed themselves a half “shekel” per person for the maintenance of the temple, the Romans levied a tax of fifteen shkolim (thirty times as much) on every person for the expenses of their temple of Jupiter who “helped them triumph over their enemies.”
When the reports of the valor of the Jews in the war became known and the world realized that without the aid of Jewish traitors mighty Rome with its iron legions could not have conquered the small land of Judea, the Roman rulers hired scribes to belittle the bravery of the Jewish warriors and to make them appear as ordinary robber bands which could have been annihilated by a single Roman battalion were it not that the “kind” Titus sought to spare the land but, his patience becoming exhausted, he decided to show the rebels the might of Rome.
Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai wanted to establish the custom of pilgrimages to Jabneh to take the place of the previous pilgrimages to Jerusalem. In this he but partly succeeded. Many people did come from far and near to celebrate the feast days in Jabneh and especially those Jews who lived outside of Judea who came to find out the law regarding matters of which they were in doubt. But the majority of the people continued to observe their feast days in the desolate Jerusalem on the site of the burned temple, which lost none of its sanctity in their eyes.
Rabban Jochanan did succeed in concentrating the priests about himself in Jabneh that they might wait there until called to the rebuilding of a new temple. In the meantime he instructed the people to observe the commandments of offering the tithes and the priests had to observe all the laws of cleanliness and to eat their tithes in purity even as they did when the temple was in existence.
Even as he previously did in Jerusalem, Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai now continued to search for the basic explanation of all the laws and in this he was highly successful. Every commandment of the Torah he explained in wise and convincing words. Only in the matter of the prohibition of the use of the flesh of pigs and of wearing “Shatnes” (cloth woven out of wool and flax), the commandments of “Halitza” and “Yibum” (the marriage of a childless widow to her husband’s brother), the laws of the purification of lepers, the scapegoat sent to Azazel on the Day of Atonement and the sacrifice of the red heifer, these he did not attempt to rationalize. These were all laws of such a fundamental nature, he was wont to say, that they should not be debated.
A “Hebrew slave” who refused his freedom at the end of six years of servitude had the lobe of his ear pierced, Rabban Jochanan explained, because the ear heard the words of God uttered from mount Sinai that “all Jews are my servants.” He who has exchanged the rule of God for the rule of man is deserving that his ear be pierced as a sign of eternal shame.
Once his disciples asked Rabban Jochanan why no iron might be used in the construction of an altar. To this he replied that since swords, which are a symbol of punishment, are made out of iron while the altar is a symbol of forgiveness, it is necessary to keep these two opposing symbols apart. And if the inanimate stones of the altar, which cannot speak or think, must not be cut with iron because they cause peace to be made between Jews and their Father in Heaven, one must therefore consider how much more honor is due to a person who makes peace between man and wife, between one city and another, between one nation and another or between one family and another.
In spite of the fact that the temple was burned and Jerusalem was destroyed, the Jews did not consider themselves as exiles so long as they remained on their own soil. But all those Jews who lived in Babylonia and other lands were considered to be in captivity since Nebuchadnezzar exiled them. Rabban Jochanan was once asked by his disciples why God caused most of the Jews to be exiled to Babylonia and he answered that they were like a woman who sins against her husband and is sent by him to her father’s home. God exiled the Jews to Babylonia when they sinned against him because that is the land that Abraham came from.
There is an opinion that Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai was a priest and that he officiated in the service in the temple together with the other priests. Thus it is told that his disciples asked him about some custom pertaining to sacrifices, but when he answered they were dissatisfied with his reply and proved to him that he did not remember the procedure in the temple on certain occasions. Rabban Jochanan said: “You are right. I have forgotten what I did myself.” When he was still in Jerusalem he came into conflict with the High Priest, whom he threatened with revenge, but this High Priest died before his plan of vengeance was carried out.
Rabban Jochanan also objected, while still in Jerusalem, to the procedure of stunning the animals brought as sacrifices in order to facilitate their slaughter. He claimed that such a procedure crippled the animal and caused unclean flesh to be offered on the altar.
It is obvious that while the Romans ruled over the lives and the possessions of the Jews in a barbaric fashion the morals of the Jewish women could not remain in their former purity. The royal house of Agrippa II as well as his sister Berenice and some of the priests of that time could hardly serve as an example of morality for Jewish women. Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai realized that Jewish family life was being wrecked by this immorality. He then abolished the procedure of taking a <span dir="rtl">סוטה</span> before a priest and the administering of the water since it would have to be applied to the majority of the women of Judea if it remained in force.
Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai frequently debated the commandments of the Torah with non-Jews. Despite the fact that the Jews lost the war and that the Romans hired scribes to slander them, this was a time when numerous Gentile scholars were deeply interested in the Torah and were anxious to discuss its commandments with Jews. They were amazed at the stubborness with which this small people clung to its faith.
Rabban Jochanan engaged in similar disputations with the Sadducees. Although these no longer existed as a separate party, there were still men in prominent positions who conducted themselves according to the teachings of the Sadducees. Rabban Jochanan was wont to debate with them and attempted to prove that they were not Jews.
But his attitude was entirely different when disputing with a Gentile. When one of these asked him whether there would ever come a day when Jews and Gentiles would be happy, Rabban Jochanan answered that it would have to be a rainy day.
Later his disciples asked him whether God approved of charitable deeds of Gentiles because the verse “the kindness of nations is a sin” was then commonly interpreted to mean that even good deeds of Gentiles are sinful. Rabban Jochanan said that the real meaning of the verse is different from the accepted one and that it intends to convey the idea that just as a sin offering brings forgiveness for Jews even so do charitable deeds compensate for the sins of Gentiles.
Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai devoted himself a great deal to the mysteries of the creation of the world and to the “Divine Chariot” of Ezekiel’s prophecy. A legend relates that he was once riding on a donkey while his best pupil, Rabbi Elazar ben Arach, was walking after him. Rabbi Elazar said: “Let us now study a chapter on the construction of the Chariot.” But Rabban Jochanan said that one must not discuss this subject with only one pupil unless he is one who understands everything himself without explanation from his teacher. To this Rabbi Elazar answered: “Then let me expound the construction of the Chariot and you will see whether I understand it without an explanation of my teacher.”
Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai descended from his donkey and, wrapping himself in his robe, they sat down on a rock under an olive tree. After he heard the exposition of his pupil he kissed him on the head and said: “Blessed be the God of Israel who granted to Father Abraham a son who understands so much and who expounds so nicely for the glory of his Father in Heaven.”
Out of the great number of his pupils five were particularly noteworthy and Rabban Jochanan praised each of them for his virtues. The names of the five were: R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, R. Joshua ben Chananiah, R. Jose Hacohen, R. Simeon ben Nathanel and R. Elazar ben Arach. Of these Rabban Jochanan said that R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus was like a lime pit which does not lose a single drop of water; of R. Joshua ben Chananiah he said, happy is the mother who gave birth to such a son; of R. Jose Hacohen he said that he was pious; R. Simeon ben Nathanel avoided sin and R. Elazar ben Arach was like a spring which wells up ever stronger.
Of them Rabban Jochanan said further: “If the wisdom of all Jewish scholars were to be placed on one side of the scale and the wisdom of R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus on the other side than his wisdom would outweigh that of all the others.” At a later date he was said to have declared: “If the wisdom of all the Jewish scholars together with that of R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus were to be placed on one side of the scale and the wisdom of R. Elazar ben Arach were to be placed on the other side, then his would outweigh that of all the others.”
There seems to have been no limit to the reverence which the disciples of Rabban Jochanan accorded him. They referred to him in no other terms than “the light of Israel,” “the right pillar” and “the strong hammer.” They said of him that he was the only teacher of kindness and peace who realized the worth of human freedom for he sharply opposed slavishness in man. Rabban Jochanan also admired all good qualities in man irrespective of what nation that man belonged to. When he taught the necessity of loving God, he instructed that He should be loved as a child loves its father and not as a slave loves his lord.
When Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai left Jerusalem he established his academy in Jabneh but his private residence was in a place called “Barur Chail” and there he was followed by his disciples. It seems that when Rabban Gamliel II (the son of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel who was killed before the destruction of the temple) grew of age and Rabban Jochanan realized that he was fit to occupy the position of his father in the leadership of Jewish life, he resigned his position of “Nasi.” He gave this office to Rabban Gamliel and he settled in “Barur Chail.” But even there he was followed by many people who did not leave him till the day of his death.
As the days of Rabban Jochanan neared their end, he regretted the oncoming death. When his disciples came to visit him, he wept in their presence. They asked him: “Rabbi, why do you weep?” and he replied, “When a man has to appear for trial before a king whose rule is only temporary, whose kindness is passing and whose anger does not last, he is seized by terror; how much more understandable is the terror which seizes one who has to be tried by the King of kings whose rule is eternal, whose anger is everlasting and whose kindness endures forever.”

The Colleagues of R' Jochanan ben Zakkai

N<small>UMEROUS PROMINENT SCHOLARS</small> survived the suffering of the destruction in Jerusalem together with Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai. Some of them escaped the city at an earlier or later date and together they settled in Jabneh.
One of these scholars, the closest to R. Jochanan, was Rabbi Zadok ben Elazar. This was the same Rabbi Zadok for the healing of whom Rabban Jochanan asked for the services of a doctor. Just as Rabban Jochanan visualized the destruction of the temple forty years before it occurred even so did Rabbi Zadok fast every day for forty years that the temple might not be destroyed.
It is told that when Rabban Jochanan presented Rabbi Zadok before Vespasian in the Roman camp outside of Jerusalem he showed more reverence to Rabbi Zadok than he did to Vespasian. When Vespasian noted this he asked, “What distinction has this man?” and Rabban Jochanan replied: “I can assure you that had there been another one like him you could not have triumphed over our people even if you had brought twice as many soldiers as you did.”
Vespasian further asked, “Wherein lies his strength?” and Rabban Jochanan answered, “For forty years he neither ate nor drank anything more than the juice of one fig which he consumed every night and after this he taught a host of disciples all day. You can therefore realize that had there been another like him, God would have had to spare our city for the sake of two such holy men.”
It is further told that once, when Rabbi Zadok was a priest in the temple, he saw two young priests hurrying to the service. In their haste they tried to overtake each other and when the nimbler one gained the lead he was stabbed by the one that trailed behind. Rabbi Zadok then called out in this wise: “Hear me oh, Jews. Here you see the body of a slain man and you all learned that when a murdered man is found and it is not known by whom he was killed it is necessary to behead a calf and over it the elders of the city must declare that they are innocent of the blood that was shed, that their hand was not in the crime, nor have they seen it committed. Now there arises the question arises whether the city or the temple has to bring this case, for I alone saw the crime and the law states that one witness is insufficient to condemn a man to death. According to the law it would therefore seem that the identity of the murderer has not been established and it is necessary for the elders to declare their innocence. Now the question whether the city or the temple has to bring this offering, for neither one of the two can conscientiously say “our hands did not shed this blood”; both the city and the people are guilty and the blood of the murdered man is a blot on both.”
Speaking in this vein he aroused all those gathered until they shed tears. When the father of the murdered man later declared that the victim was not killed outright and the dagger with which he was stabbed was therefore not unclean from coming in contact with a dead body, and he thus established that it was unnecessary to bring a sacrifice, because the victim atoned with his blood for the sins of the city, all those gathered rushed at the murderer and in an instant he was annihilated so that nothing remained of him.
It was also told of Rabbi Zadok that R. Gamliel ben R. Simeon (commonly referred to as Rabban Gamliel of Jabneh, he was also Nasi after the death of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai) once gave a feast in his house for the scholars. Rabban Gamliel waited on his guests himself and with his own hand he filled their beakers. He handed the first beaker of wine to Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus but Rabbi Eliezer refused it, not wishing to be waited on by Rabban Gamliel. Rabban Gamliel then handed the same beaker to Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania and he accepted it.
Rabbi Eliezer then exclaimed: “How can one tolerate that Rabban Gamliel should stand and wait on us while we are sitting down?” but Rabbi Joshua answered: “One greater than Rabban Gamliel did the same. Our father Abraham was the greatest man of his generation, nevertheless he waited on his guests and served them. Even though his guests were angels, Abraham did not at first know it but thought that they were Arabs. I therefore see no wrong in that Rabban Gamliel serves the students of the Torah.”
Rabbi Zadok then arose from his place and said: “How much longer will you remain indifferent to the honor of God while you devote yourself to the honor due to man? God causes the winds to blow and the rain to fall, he fructifies the earth and provides for every creature according to its needs. All this he does not only for the just but also for the wicked and the idolaters. Is it not more than right that scholars like you should be served by Rabban Gamliel himself?”
Sometime later Rabbi Zadok saw the ruins of the temple and, turning his eyes heavenward, he said: “Creator of the world, You have done well. You have destroyed Your city, You burned Your temple and You remain calm as if You were not concerned.” That same night Rabbi Zadok had a dream. In his dream he saw God mourning over the ruins of the temple while the angels were weeping bitterly. He then became convinced that God mourned the destruction just as the people did.
When the leaders of the people realized that the laws and customs of Judaism were becoming forgotten they called all the scholars together on a certain day, and each of them recounted the laws and traditions as he remembered them. Rabbi Zadok testified in every case that a law was doubtful and his words were accepted as law.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עדיות פרק ז׳.</span></i>
The Talmud quotes the opinions of Rabbi Zadok a number of times in substantiation of laws. A maxim of his regarding the worth of the Torah, which later became popular among scholars, is also quoted. Rabbi Zadok used to say: You must not make the Torah as a crown to magnify yourself nor as a spade wherewith to dig.
Rabbi Zadok had a son, Rabbi Elazar, who was prominent during the decade preceding the destruction of the temple. His son devoted himself to commerce mostly and he obtained the title of Rabbi although he did not found an academy. When Rabbi Zadok was cured after his long fast through the intercession of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai with Vespasian, his son said to him: “Give your healers their reward in this world that they may make no demands upon you in the world to come.” Instead of paying them with gold, Rabbi Zadok taught them to calculate on their fingers and also the rules of the calculation of weights.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">איכה רבתי פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא ל״א.</span></i>
Rabbi Elazar also quoted his father as saying: “To what may one compare a just man in this world? One may compare him to a tree which grows in a clean place but whose branches extend over an unclean place. If those branches are cut off the tree and its roots continue to remain clean. Even so does God bring affliction on just men that they may be worthy of the pleasures of the world to come.

Rabbi Zechariah ben HaKatzav was another colleague of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai. His name is mentioned in connection with a situation which throws some light on the moral and social relationships of that time.
A woman who is held captive by the Gentiles in order to obtain a ransom may continue to live with her husband after she is released. A woman who is captured with the intention of being killed is forbidden to live with her husband after she is released, for we are justified in assuming that she submitted to the Gentiles in order to save her life. If a city has been occupied by an army, the wives of all the priests may not continue to live with their husbands unless they bring witnesses that testify to their purity; even if the witnesses are slaves or women servants their testimony is trustworthy. Untrustworthy is one’s own testimony, for one may not testify on his own behalf. Then Rabbi Zechariah said: “I swear by the sanctity of the temple that as long as the soldiers were in Jerusalem I did not let my wife out of my sight.” But the other scholars told him that no one might be trusted when testifying on his own behalf.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות כ״ז א׳ וב׳.</span></i>
He was thus given a theoretical answer without being told what to do and the outcome of the case remains unknown. From other instances in the Talmud we learn that Rabbi Zechariah always sought to be lenient in such circumstances. Thus we find another case<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">משנה עדיות פרק ח׳.</span></i> of a young girl who was held as hostage among the Gentiles of Ascalon. When she returned from her captivity her family disowned her. There then appeared witnesses who testified that the girl was not violated while in captivity, but the members of her family refused to believe their testimony. Then the scholars said to them: If you believe that the girl was held captive then you must accept the testimony of the witnesses; if you refuse to believe them, then you have no grounds to believe that she was captive.
Rabbi Zechariah’s name also appears on other occasions. Once the scholars were trying to determine a case of the inheritance of a daughter who had no brothers. In relation to this case the Talmud states that the law was established according to the opinion of Rabbi Zechariah.
* * *
Among the colleagues of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai there was also Rabbi Nechunia (or Jochanan) ben Gudgada. He was a Levite in the temple and was in charge of the gates. He was a very pious man, and even after the temple no longer existed he continued to observe scrupulously all the regulations pertaining to purity. In the performance of his office he was very severe and while still gate keeper of the temple he said that any Levite who becomes confused during the singing at the service deserves to be punished by death. When Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania once wanted to aid him in closing the temple gates he refused the assistance for the same reasons.
The opinions of Rabbi Nechunia ben Gudgada, which he expressed at the time that all the scholars were questioned regarding the traditions of the laws, are interesting and characteristic of the times. He declared that a deaf girl who was given in marriage by her father might be divorced by her husband. Until that time it was accepted that a deaf woman might be divorced, but the case was not clear if the woman was given in marriage by her father. Until then it was also the accepted rule that if a man stole wood and used it in the construction of a building that the building be destroyed and the wood returned to its owner.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית ט״ז א׳.</span></i> But Rabbi Nechunia ruled that it was only necessary to pay the value of the article that was stolen. Similarly he ruled that a person who sacrifices a stolen animal as a sin offering has discharged his duty so long as it remains unknown that the animal was stolen.
* * *
One of the most outstanding contemporaries of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai was Rabbi Nechunia ben Hakanah. Long before the destruction of the temple he was recognized as the leader of his own academy which remained a separate school and was not under the jurisdiction of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai.
It is told that whenever Rabbi Nechunia went to his academy and returned home from it he would repeat a prayer whose contents have become immortalized and which serves as an example for later generations. When asked about his prayer he said: “When I go to the academy I pray to God to save me from error; that I should have no occasion to be angered at my comrades, nor that they should have to be angered with me. I pray that in my teachings I should not declare the clean to be unclean and the unclean to be clean, and that I should not be put to shame either in this world or in the world to come. When I leave the academy I thank the Creator for all that happened to me during the day; especially do I thank Him for this that it is my share to sit in a house of learning and not among the sinful, the idle and the scornful, for my way leads to eternal life and their way leads to hell.”
Rabbi Nechunia ben Hakanah was already an old man during the time of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai. When his disciples asked him what he had done to deserve to be rewarded with long life he answered them: “I never sought to gain honor through the shame of another; I also never went to sleep until I knew that there was no person harboring ill will against me and I was never stingy with my money.”
Although Rabbi Nechunia headed an academy of his own there always existed the most friendly relations between him and Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai. This was clearly illustrated at the time when Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai expounded to his disciples the meaning of the Biblical verse “Justice exalteth a people but the disgrace of nations is a sin.” (Proverbs, 14:34.) Everyone was asked to express his opinion of the meaning of the verse. At the request of Rabban Jochanan, Rabbi Nechunia also stated his interpretation whereupon Rabban Jochanan said to his pupils: “I favor the opinion of Rabbi Nechunia more than my own and more than the opinions which you rendered.”
A maxim of Rabbi Nechunia which he frequently repeated was characteristic of the man. He was wont to say: “Whoever assumes the yoke of the Torah is relieved of the yoke of government and of the yoke of worldly occupations.” From this saying we may conclude that he was wealthy and was not worried with finding the means of livelihood; however, there is no documentary substantiation for such an opinion.
Of all his numerous decisions in matters pertaining to law there remained only one rule about the laws affecting the Day of Atonement. “Just as one who desecrates the Sabbath has forfeited his life but is free from payment, even so does one who desecrates the Day of Atonement forfeit his life but is free from payment.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים כ״ט א׳.</span></i> This statement is interpreted by some to mean, that a person who has done work on the Sabbath is to be condemned to death but such a person no longer has to observe the Sabbath and is not to be punished for any further violations of the Sabbath, similarly one is to be punished for the desecration of the Day of Atonement, but until such punishment is meted out the offender is no longer bound by the regulations of the day. Another interpretation of his statement is that a person who has forfeited his life for desecrating the Sabbath does not in addition have to offer a sacrifice for the atonement of his sin; similarly, one who desecrated the Day of Atonement does not have to offer such a sacrifice even though the punishment for his transgression is in the hands of God.
Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha, the pupil of Rabbi Nechunia, learned much from his teacher. Pondering the mysteries of life, he cited numerous sayings of his master especially in respect to the interpretation of various texts. He thus proved the power of repentance by the example of Pharaoh. Pharaoh asked Moses, “Who is God that I should listen to his voice?” but later, when he was being engulfed by the waters of the sea he realized that the God of Moses was the true God and in order to gain favor in His eyes he cried out, “Who is like you among the gods oh Lord!” God therefore saved him from the sea and he later became king of Nineveh. When the prophet Jonah came to Nineveh to announce the word of God, Pharaoh already understood that he spoke in the name of the God of Moses, who may not be resisted. He therefore arose from his throne and rent his clothes; he put on sack cloth and ashes and commanded his people to fast in order to appease the anger of God.

Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas was another contemporary of Rabban Jochanan. The mention that is made of him in both the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmud indicates that he played an important role in codifying the Halacha. Ordinarily he was inclined to lenience where other scholars advocated severity. He frequently argued against the opinions of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai, Akabia ben Mahalalel and Rabbi Chanina, deputy of the High Priest, and his opinions touched on all matters of Jewish life.
The respect in which he was held by the other scholars is seen from the fact that in his later years, when old age and failing eyesight made it impossible for him to come to the academy, the scholars came to his home to discuss the various laws. Being a rich man, the Talmud relates that he seated his guests on couches of gold. The attitude of that time toward learning is portrayed in the story of Rabbi Dosa who told that the mother of Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania was in the habit of bringing her infant son to the Synagogue in his crib in order that he might absorb the words of the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי יבמות פרק א׳.</span></i>
A maxim of Rabbi Dosa concerning the proper conduct for men has been immortalized by the people. It said: Morning sleep and midday wine and children’s talk and spending time with the vulgar drive a man from the world.
* * *
The most interesting of the scholars of that time was undoubtedly Rabbi Nachum of Gimso. He was a native of the town Gimso which was located east of Lud. This town is mentioned in Chronicles II as having been conquered by Philistines from the Jews during the reign of king Ahaz. Since Nachum was in the habit of saying “All is for the best” (<span dir="rtl">גם זו לטובה</span>) on every occasion, the name of his native town assumed a double significance, and the appelation “the man of Gimso” may have referred to his native town or to his oft used maxim.
None of his teachings have come down to us although it is proudly mentioned that he was the teacher of Rabbi Akiba.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה י״ב א׳.</span></i> But his whole life is described as a continuous series of miracles which occurred to him, and because of his worth these also affected the whole people.
It is told that even when the worst befell him he would say “It is for the best.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית כ״א א׳.</span></i> Once, when the emperor was angry and threatened new decrees, the Jews decided to appease his anger with a gift. But there was no one whom they could send, for the messenger was in danger of losing his life in case the emperor refused the gift. They therefore decided to send it with Nachum of Gimso, feeling certain that if he would be the bearer of the gift it would be accepted and he would succeed in obtaining the desired concessions.
The Jews of his city thereupon filled a box with diamonds and pearls to send to the emperor. While on his way, Nachum stopped overnight in a hostelry which harbored thieves. The thieves removed the diamonds and the pearls and filled the box with sand. But when Nachum saw this he was not afraid but said, “It is for the best,” for he felt certain that God would so order it that the king would accept the sand instead of the diamonds.
Thus he proceeded on his way until he arrived in the royal city and when it was discovered that the gift which he brought was ordinary sand there was great anger against the Jews, for it seemed as if they were mocking the emperor.
But then there appeared the prophet Elijah in the guise of a courier and he calmed the assembly by saying: “I think that the Jews have sent a very valuable gift to the emperor, for the sand in this box is the same sand that was used by Abraham who shot it from his bow at the four kings of the host of Kedarlaomer when they captured Lot.” It so happened that the emperor was then engaged in a war with a neighboring country which he could not conquer. The sand which Nachum brought in the box was therefore tried on the enemy and its effects were so marvelous that the enemy was immediately subdued. When the emperor realized the value of the sand which the Jews sent him he decided to do kind deeds to Jews. The box was filled with diamonds and pearls from the emperor’s treasury and Nachum was sent back in great honor.
On his return trip he again lodged in the same hostelry and everyone marvelled that he was still alive. When they asked him what happened he told them everything and also of the marvellous nature of the sand.
The people immediately filled large boxes with the same sand and took these to the emperor. They told the emperor that Nachum was carrying diamonds and pearls as a gift for him but that these were stolen and sand from their house was substituted instead. As proof they brought the boxes filled with the same sand.
Then the emperor commanded that this be investigated and when it was proved that the sand which they brought did not possess the same virtues as the sand which Nachum brought they were accused of trying to deceive the king and were sentenced to death.
It is also told that in his old age Nachum became blind and lost the use of his arms and legs. He lay in an old shack which was ready to tumble any minute. The shack was also infested with vermin and the bed posts were placed in bowls of water to prevent the vermin from climbing up. Once his pupils wanted to remove his bed from the house but he commanded them to remove the furnishings first, for they could feel certain that as long as he remained within the house it would not collapse. They did as he commanded them and the minute that they carried him out on his bed the house collapsed.
His disciples thereupon said to him: “Is it possible that a just man like you should suffer such a bitter end?”
To this Nachum replied: “Children, I have well deserved it. Once, as I was going to the house of my father-in-law, leading three donkeys loaded with food and drink, a poor man came to me and asked, that I should give him food. But I said to him: Wait until I unload the donkey. But before I had time to unload the donkey, the poor man fell down dead from hunger. It was then that I cursed myself that my eyes which had no pity on his eyes should become blind and that all my limbs which did not hasten to feed the poor should become crippled.”

Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa

F<small>ROM WHAT WE KNOW</small> of the material circumstances of Rabban Jochanan and his contemporaries we may assume that the poorest of them all was Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa. But he was also the most pious and the miracles which are said to have occurred to him transcend even the wondrous adventures of Nachum of Gimso. It was commonly believed that the whole generation of which Chanina was a contemporary lived only through his grace.
Rabbi Chanina knew poverty long before the destruction of the temple. He lived in the town of Arab in Galilee and engaged in stone cutting. This was hard work but did not suffice to feed Rabbi Chanina with bread and he had to content himself with a measure of carobs from one Sabbath till the next.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות י״ז ב׳, תענית כ״ד ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Chanina was a disciple of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai who lived in Arab for some time. He did not head any academy and no legal decisions are quoted in his name, but he was held by everyone to be a great saint and whenever people became involved in trouble they came to Rabbi Chanina that he should pray for them, for every one believed that his word carried great weight with the Lord.
He was also exemplary in his conduct before God and man and he frequently said: “Everyone whose fear of sin comes before his wisdom, his wisdom endures; everyone whose deeds are more than his wisdom, his wisdom endures; everyone who pleases mankind with his deeds also pleases God.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק ג׳ משנה ט׳.</span></i>
In his town Rabbi Chanina saw many people going on their pilgrimage to Jerusalem carrying in their hands gifts for the temple and he was grieved that whenever he went to Jerusalem he went empty handed, for he had nothing to bring. But once, while at his work, he saw a beautiful large stone which was fit to lie before the temple so that the pilgrims who come there for the feast days may sit on it and rest. He took out this stone and polished it smooth, then he vowed to bring it as a gift to the temple.
But he could not carry the stone from Arab to Jerusalem alone. He decided to hire laborers and he called five men, which was the number needed to carry it to the city. But these men asked for one hundred “Selaim.” He would gladly have paid this sum and even more, but since he did not possess even a single coin he said to them: “Where shall I take one hundred ‘Selaim’ when I do not possess even half that sum? But if you will help me carry the stone without compensation you may have whatever reward is due to me for this good deed.”
The men thereupon went away and left the stone on the ground. But God could no longer look at the sorrow of Rabbi Chanina and he sent him five other men who asked for only five “Selaim” for the labor of transporting the stone; they agreed to do so on condition that Rabbi Chanina should help them carry the stone. Rabbi Chanina believed that he would be able to borrow the five “Selaim” wherewith to pay the laborers as soon as he arrived in Jerusalem and he therefore agreed to the price. But the work did not last long, for as soon as Rabbi Chanina touched the stone they all found themselves in Jerusalem. When he began looking for the men in order to pay them, they had vanished and he could find them no longer.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שיר השירים רבה וקהלת רבה.</span></i>
Rabbi Chanina’s wife was said never to have complained about their poverty and bore all the suffering quietly. Only once did she depart from her patience and said to her husband: “How long must we suffer in poverty? Ask the Heavenly One that He should give you something on account of what is coming to you in the world to come.”
Rabbi Chanina heeded her words and prayed to God. There then appeared a hand which gave him the golden leg of a table. That night he saw in his dream how all the just men sit in Paradise about golden tables each of which has three legs, only he and his wife sit by a table which only has two legs. He awoke very much disturbed and said to his wife: “Would you rather see all other just men in the world to come sit about whole tables while we sit by a broken one?”
He therefore prayed to God that the gift be taken back and the same hand appeared and took it. The friends of Rabbi Chanina considered the second marvel to be even greater than the first.
Rabbi Chanina’s wife had a neighbor who derided her for her poverty and because of her she was in the habit of lighting a fire in the oven every Friday. Although she had nothing to cook or bake, she wanted that neighbor to see the smoke rising from the chimney and to believe that nothing was lacking for the Sabbath. But this neighbor understood the trick and she once came to Rabbi Chanina’s house to show his wife that she was not fooled. As she knocked on the door, Rabbi Chanina’s wife opened it, but before the neighbor could enter she ran and hid in the attic in order not to meet her. When the neighbor came in she saw the oven full of bread and the barrel filled with dough and she called the wife of Rabbi Chanina to come and take the bread out of the oven before it was burned.
Still another story is related of the wife of Rabbi Chanina. It is said that Rabbi Jochanan once traveled on a ship and he saw floating upon the water a basket decorated with pearls and diamonds and surrounded by all kinds of rare fish. One man jumped into the water to retrieve the basket, but a fish came up and tried to bite off his legs. The people on the boat poured vinegar on the fish until it swam away and then a voice from heaven was heard saying: “What do you want with this basket? It belongs to the wife of Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa and in the world to come she will weave from it the decorations for the praying shawls of the just men.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא ע״ד א׳.</span></i>
We already told that in time of calamity everyone turned to Rabbi Chanina. Thus it happened that the daughter of Nechunia the well digger once fell into a well which her father dug. People at once ran to Rabbi Chanina that he should advise how to raise the girl from the well.
Rabbi Chanina at once declared that this event will have a happy ending, then he said: “Go home. She is out of the well.” The people asked him: “How do you know? Are you a seer?” But Rabbi Chanina said: “I am not a seer but I feel certain that since the just man Nechunia occupied himself with digging wells so that the pilgrims to Jerusalem may have water to drink, God will not permit a child of so just a man to be drowned in one of her father’s wells.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות קכ״א ב׳.</span></i>
It was because of such events that the faith of the people in the efficacy of the prayers of Rabbi Chanina increased. In case of sickness they came to him that he should pray for the sick and when he was engaged in prayer everyone could see that he was so deeply immersed in it that had a snake wound itself about his feet he would not have been aware of it. He also immediately foretold the success of his prayer whether the sick will get well again. When he was asked how he could tell the outcome of his prayer, he said: When I utter the prayer smoothly then I know that it was accepted, but if I have difficulty in praying then I know that it was rejected.
The son of the Nasi, Rabban Gamliel, once fell sick and the Nasi sent two of his outstanding disciples to Rabbi Chanina to ask him that he pray for the cure of the sick person. Rabbi Chanina ascended the roof of his house to be nearer to God while praying. When he descended he told the messengers: “You may now go home for the patient is no longer in fever.” The messengers noted down the words of Rabbi Chanina and the exact moment at which they were uttered. When they informed Rabban Gamliel he told them that everything happened exactly as Rabbi Chanina said.
Another time the son of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai was sick and Rabban Jochanan sent a message to Rabbi Chanina saying: “Chanina, my son, pray to God that my son shall remain alive.” Rabbi Chanina bowed with his head between his knees and prayed a long time until he suddenly declared that Rabban Jochanan’s son will certainly survive. When Rabban Jochanan thanked him for his effort, he also explained to his wife that had he prayed to God himself, even if he had stood with his head between his knees all day, he would have achieved nothing. Rabban Jochanan’s wife then asked him: “Is Chanina more acceptable to God then you are?” But Rabban Jochanan answered: “He may not be more acceptable in the eyes of God but he is as a servant in the palace of a king who is closer to the king than all others. I am as a minister of the king who sometimes has to withstand the king’s anger and to whom the king may refuse to grant favors.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ל״ד ב׳.</span></i>
Among the wondrous legends about Rabbi Chanina it is also told that he was once travelling on his way when a sudden rain began to descend and he was hindered in his journey. He turned his face heavenward and said: “Creator of the world! The whole world is enjoying the rain, only I am suffering from it.” The rain immediately ceased and when Rabbi Chanina arrived at home there was a drought. His conscience plagued him that the rain, which the earth needed so much, had ceased and he further addressed God: “The whole world is now suffering only I am glad,” and the rain began to descend again.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית כ״ד ב׳.</span></i>
Of Rabbi Chanina’s unusual honesty it is told that a man once passed and left a few hens on his doorstep. Rabbi Chanina then said to his wife: “Since the hens are not your own you may not use their eggs.” His wife then sold the eggs and with the money she accumulated she bought some goats. When the owner of the hens came to claim them Rabbi Chanina also gave him the goats.
Both before and after the temple was destroyed Rabbi Chanina scrupulously set aside the tithes from all food which came on his table. As he was once eating at the table, all the food suddenly vanished. His wife explained to him that she had borrowed that day’s food from a neighbor who probably had not set aside the tithes. Rabbi Chanina decided in his mind to set aside the tithes and the food reappeared on the table.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי דמאי פרק א׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
His observance of the tithes was so extreme that even his donkey could tell whether the hay placed before it had been tithed. Once the donkey was stolen and, when the thieves placed hay before it, it refused to eat. Realizing that if they kept the donkey it would starve to death they let it loose and it ran back to Rabbi Chanina.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק ח׳.</span></i>
It is further related that in a certain place there was a poisonous scorpion which bit people and the stricken ones died from its venom. This was told to Rabbi Chanina and he said: “Come, show me where this scorpion hides.” He was taken to the place and he put his foot over the hole. The scorpion came up to bite him and while doing so it died. Rabbi Chanina then carried the scorpion around in the academy and he said: “Now you can see that not the scorpion kills a person but his sins.” Seeing this the people said: “Woe to the man who meets a scorpion and woe to the scorpion which meets Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa.”
Similarly it is told that Rabbi Chanina once met the queen of the evil spirits, Igereth bath Machlath, who goes about accompanied by 180 thousand destroying angels to harm people. Igereth said to Rabbi Chanina, “If I had not been warned from heaven not to touch you because of your knowledge of the Torah, I would now do you harm.” Rabbi Chanina said to her: “If it is true that I am so important in Heaven then I command you never to go again where people live.” But she entreated him that he should not entirely drive her out of human habitation and he allowed her two nights every week when she may have power over people (Wednesday and Saturday nights).
Once on a Friday Rabbi Chanina noticed that his daughter was sitting sorrowful and depressed. He asked her, “What happened, my daughter, that you are so sorrowful?” and she replied, “By mistake I filled the Sabbath lamp with vinegar instead of oil.” But Rabbi Chanina comforted her and said, “Why do you worry? God who commanded that oil should burn can also cause vinegar to give light.”
It is related that the vinegar burned all day Saturday and lasted until the Havdalah was lit from it.
When Rabbi Chanina was about to die he raised his hands to God and said: “Dear God, you know that all my life I never made the least use of your beautiful world.”… After his death it was said in his praise that he never uttered a falsehood. He was also the last of the people who despised words and preferred deeds, and with his death there broke the chain of piety.
Of the importance of charity it was later told that he held an opinion differing from that of the other scholars of his generation and he said: “There is no better charity which can save people from Gehenna than the Torah itself.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מדרש משלי פּרשה י״א.</span></i>

Rabban Gamliel II of Jabneh

W<small>HEN—ACCORDING TO TRADITION</small>—Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai died at the age of 120 years he was succeeded as Nasi of the Sanhedrin by Rabban Gamliel, the son of Rabban Simeon who was killed during the rebellion against Rome, and grandson of Rabban Gamliel the Elder. Rabban Gamliel the Elder was a grandson of Hillel. Rabban Gamliel II was thus the fifth descendant in line to Hillel.
Being a descendant of Hillel, Rabban Gamliel was looked up to as a scion of the Royal House of David, and as long as one such remained, no one doubted his rights to the office of Nasi. But his assumption of this office was probably delayed because at the time that his father was killed, Rabban Gamliel was a young and sickly child and he could not be entrusted with such a responsible office. Assumption of the position of Nasi was also subject to the approval of the government and therefore some time elapsed before the Roman authorities were ready to consent to the appointment of a Nasi whose father lost his life in a revolution.
Throughout the time that Rabban Gamliel was Nasi the Sanhedrin was maintained in Jabneh with a membership of seventy-two,<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ידים פרק ג׳ משנה ה׳.</span></i> and although Rabban Gamliel traelled extensively and issued his decisions in many places he always stressed that Jabneh must remain the local point of Jewish life. Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai previously strived to attain the same end. But it is interesting to know that the relations between Rabban Gamliel and some of the outstanding disciples of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai were frequently strained. One of these disciples, Rabbi Elazar ben Arach, was persuaded by his wife to leave Jabneh. He expected that a great number of scholars would follow him because of his prominence. It is told of him that when he once expounded before his master the mysteries of the “Divine Chariot,” a fiery cloud descended from heaven and hid both of them from the eyes of the passers-by and a host of angels descended to hear his exposition. But in spite of all the reverence, which these legends seem to indicate was accorded to him, Elazar ben Arach was later forgotten and no one was concerned with him.
While other scholars of that time attempted to set up academies in various cities of Palestine in an endeavor to spread the knowledge of the Torah throughout the land, Rabban Gamliel sought to concentrate all of these efforts in Jabneh. He met considerable difficulties in attaining this aim and he was compelled to resort to forceful methods and a stubborn insistence on his decisions; these in turn frequently served to alienate from him the sympathies of the followers of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai. He then would go on protracted trips to places far and near to investigate the life of the Jews, their economic welfare and their religious life. He was thus frequently to be seen in Jericho, in Acco or in Kezib and wherever he went he spoke his word in all matters of Jewish life.
Of his relations with other people it is told that he was very careful not to cause the slightest suffering to anyone. When he discovered how many rules one must observe and that it was almost impossible to avoid conflict with friends and neighbors, he wept. In general he was a very kind person and prone to tears. When a neighboring woman lost her only son and her weeping was heard for many nights, Rabban Gamliel could not restrain his commiseration and wept until his eye lashes were soft.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ק״ד ב׳.</span></i>
But in his execution of his duties as Nasi he showed not the least weakness. Here he ruled with a strong hand and was ready to crush all opposition by excommunicating or driving out the opponent without considering the position or his relationship to the antagonist. Rabban Gamliel wanted his decisions to be final and he did not permit any decisions to be made without his consent. He therefore ordered an investigation of the opinions of all his pupils and whenever it was discovered that one secretly dissented, he was not permitted to enter the academy.
Rabban Gamliel owned much land and other property but he did not have time to devote to its management and he therefore rented these out to tenants. If a tenant lacked the money to buy seed, Rabban Gamliel loaned him the money or the seed which was to be repaid after the harvest. But when harvest came he always reckoned the debt according to the lower price. Thus if the price of the seed was lower at harvest time than it was at the time that the seed was loaned, he asked to be repaid the harvest season price; similarly if the price went up, he asked for the lower price at the time that the seed was loaned. Although the law did not require such treatment of tenants, he did this in order to prevent suspicion that he was profiting from his tenants.
Being a wealthy man, Rabban Gamliel also owned numerous slaves whom he treated kindly according to the regulations of the Torah. He was particularly attached with a strong bond of friendship to his slave Tobi who, he boasted, was a scholar of no mean ability. When Tobi died, Rabban Gamliel mourned for him as for a member of his family.
Of his relationship to Tobi it is told that Rabban Gamliel wanted to free him but could find no cause for doing so. When once he accidentally blinded Tobi in one eye, Rabban Gamliel was overjoyed, for this would give him an opportunity to free the slave according to the rule of the Torah. But when he told this to Rabbi Joshua he was informed that he could not do so because the slave had no witnesses.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא ע״ד ב׳.</span></i>
Rabban Gamliel was also versed in the knowledge of mathematics and astronomy. To derive practical benefits from this knowledge he had a type of telescope made with which he could discern objects at a distance of two thousand ells both on land and on sea. In his house he had numerous drawings of the moon and when ignorant witnesses came to announce the new moon, they could point to the picture most nearly resembling what they saw.
Rabban Gamliel served the people as Nasi for over thirty years and although he was strict in the conduct of his office he was wont to say that his position was not that of a ruler but of a servant. He served faithfully and with devotion. In addition to his labors for the preservation of Judaism while travelling about, his period in office coincided with a difficult time for Jews. New decrees against the Jews were daily issued by the Romans and Rabban Gamliel constantly had to intercede to ameliorate the effects of these decrees.
As we mentioned above, Rabban Gamliel spared no opponent in his capacity of Nasi. When Rabbi Eliezer tried to establish a law according to the school of Shammai, he was excommunicated by Rabban Gamliel despite the fact that he was his brother-in-law. The scholars of the academy thereupon sharply criticized Rabban Gamliel for banning so brilliant a man as Rabbi Eliezer. Some time later Rabban Gamliel was travelling on a ship to visit distant Jewish settlements. The ship encountered tremendous waves which threatened to capsize it and Rabban Gamliel understood that this was a punishment for the ban which he imposed on Rabbi Eliezer. He then raised his hands to heaven and said: “God knows that I have done so not for the sake of my honor nor for the honor of my household but solely for the honor of God and in order to prevent disputes among Jews.” When he finished speaking the sea at once became calm and he safely arrived at his destination.
One of the chief opponents of Rabban Gamliel was Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania. Rabbi Joshua was known as a gentle peace loving man. He was always dissatisfied with the innovations of Rabban Gamliel but he was powerless to contradict them because of his great poverty. Rabbi Joshua gained his livelihood from making needles.
At that time there did not yet exist a definitely established calendar. Every month messengers were sent out to observe the appearance of the new moon and even though the scholars could calculate the exact moment of the appearance of the moon, it was prohibited to decide on the day of the new month without the testimony of witnesses who saw the new moon. On the basis of such testimony Rabban Gamliel once determined the day of the new year and of all the other holidays of the month of Tishri. But even as the witnesses were testifying to having observed the new moon, Rabbi Joshua felt convinced that their testimony was false for according to all possible calculations it was impossible for the new moon to have appeared. Gathering courage Rabbi Joshua told the Nasi that he was wrong in setting the date of the holidays on the basis of such testimony. This opinion was also supported by other scholars but Rabban Gamliel was adamant and refused to alter his decision. He turned to Rabbi Joshua and said: “If you have another calculation of the holidays, then I command you to appear before me carrying your cane and wallet in your hand and your bag on your shoulders on the day which you consider to be the right Day of Atonement.”
Rabbi Joshua was greatly grieved when he heard this, for he was convinced that he was right, and that it was only because of his poverty that the Nasi imposed upon him. Those of the scholars who agreed with him felt likewise. Nevertheless they advised him to do as he was bid for “everyone must obey the Nasi and whatever he says must be considered the law.” The text of the Torah enjoining the observance of the holidays they interpreted in such a manner as to prove that the court may decide on the exact day. They argued furthermore that no one must allow himself the decision of the Nasi he would also criticize the decisions of all the courts since the times of Moses.”
Rabbi Joshua was thus persuaded by his comrades and on the day which according to his calculation was the Day of Atonement, he came to Jabneh carrying his cane, his wallet and his bag. When Rabban Gamliel saw him coming he was overjoyed, he kissed him on the head and said to him: “Come in peace, my teacher and my pupil—my teacher in learnedness and my pupil in obedience.”
But in spite of the apparent reconciliation, a feeling of bitterness rankled in the heart of Rabbi Joshua since this event. He believed that he was humiliated because of his poverty. This occurrence also engendered an unspoken bitterness among other members of the Sanhedrin who resented the arbitrary behavior of their Nasi. But they stifled their opposition until another dispute arose between Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Joshua.
One of the pupils came to ask whether the reciting of the evening prayer (<span dir="rtl">מעריב</span>) was obligatory or voluntary. Rabbi Joshua told him that it was voluntary and one could do as he chose. The same pupil then asked this question of Rabban Gamliel who decided that the reciting of the “Maariv” was obligatory. The pupil then asked: “How is it that Rabbi Joshua declared it to be voluntary?” and Rabban Gamliel answered: “Wait until all the scholars come to the academy and we will discuss this matter.”
When all the scholars gathered Rabban Gamliel declared, “I have ordained that the reciting of the evening prayer is obligatory”; saying this he turned to the assembled, “is anyone opposed to this decision?”
“No one is opposed,” Rabbi Joshua answered. Upon hearing this Rabban Gamliel said, “Joshua, stand up and a witness will testify that you have ordered otherwise before.”
Rabbi Joshua obeyed and arose; he stood for a long time before Rabban Gamliel told him to return to his place. The other scholars could no longer tolerate the overbearing attitude of the Nasi; there was an uproar of protest against his conduct and the impeachment of Rabban Gamliel from his office was taken to a vote.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות כ״ז ב׳.</span></i>
When this became known, there appeared hundreds of others whom Rabban Gamliel previously expelled from the academy, and it was necessary to add 300 benches in the academy. Afterward they began to choose another Nasi instead of Rabban Gamliel. When the qualifications of all the candidates were considered it became apparent that Rabbi Joshua could not succeed Rabban Gamliel because the whole commotion arose on his account. Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus would have been a likely candidate but he was an angry person and a follower of the school of Shammai. Rabbi Akiba could not be considered because he was not descended from aristocracy; no one knew his origin and it was rumored that he was descended from proselytes. All eyes therefore turned to Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah, who was the equal of Rabban Gamliel in scholarship; he was also a descendant of an aristocratic priestly family, he possessed great wealth and was recognized by the Roman rulers.
Rabban Gamliel remained impeached for only a short time. It seems that only a few days passed before he was reinstated. The sudden outburst of the scholars against his severe conduct produced such a change in him that everyone was moved to pity. When the scholars saw that the aristocratically reared Rabban Gamliel bowed without complaint before the will of the people and that he did not break with the academy, from the presidency of which he was removed, but immediately adapted himself to his new status and took his place among the other pupils as an equal, they realized that they were overhasty and immediately considered a reconciliation.
Only then was it realized what noble traits Rabban Gamliel possessed. He was terribly humiliated; no one even thought of sparing the honor of the Nasi’s family which derived, through Hillel, from king David; only a day before everyone bowed before him, and suddenly the same people turned against him. Nevertheless he accepted the verdict of the people and did not absent himself from the academy for even one hour, although he fully realized that his situation was a very difficult one, for all his previous decisions would be reconsidered and all of his disciples of the past would attempt to prove them to be wrong.
But instead of dwelling on what happened to him he considered his behavior toward others and realized that he conducted himself too severely. He then went to Rabbi Joshua to ask his forgiveness. When he saw the darkened walls of the low narrow house in which Rabbi Joshua lived, he said, “from the walls of your house one can tell your occupation.” Believing that this was said with the intent to slight him, Rabbi Joshua answered, “Woe to the generation which has a leader like you, for you have no understanding for the suffering of the scholars and you do not know how they gain their livelihood.”
Rabban Gamliel said to him, “Now that I came to you, forgive me! Do so for the sake of the honor of my family.”
Rabbi Joshua was deeply touched at these words and readily became reconciled. Then Rabbi Akiba said to Rabbi Joshua: “We did all this for your sake; tomorrow let us both go to visit Rabban Gamliel.”
When the newly elected Nasi, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah, heard this, he declared that he wanted to accompany them to inform Rabban Gamliel of his readiness to resign.
Rabban Gamliel was thus returned to his office and Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah was made head of the court. They divided their duties among themselves. Rabban Gamliel expounded the law on two Sabbaths in succession and Rabbi Elazar expounded on the third Sabbath. It seems that since that time Rabban Gamliel interested himself more with the occupations of his pupils. When Rabbi Joshua told him that two of his disciples, Rabbi Elazar Chisma and Rabbi Jochanan ben Gudgada, could calculate the number of drops of water in the sea but could not afford bread to eat or a garment to wear, Rabban Gamliel wanted to give them positions in the academy from which they could earn their livelihood. For some reason they refused these positions.
Peace was thus re-established in the academy of Jabneh and Rabban Gamliel remained Nasi until his death. His later conduct also indicates that he relented some of his severity and if he treated someone more harshly than the occasion deserved, it evoked no protest. Meantime the decrees of Rome became more severe and Rabban Gamliel was frequently compelled to journey to Rome to intercede for the Jews and to effect the revocation of some decree or, at least, to ameliorate its effects. He was often accompanied by some of his comrades on these trips and he was invariably successful in the accomplishment of his mission. His aristocratic bearing and his fluent Greek speech gained for him the confidence of the court and of the highest officials of the empire.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי סנהדרין פרק ז׳ הלכה י״ג, דברים רבה פּ׳ ב׳ פּיסקא כ״ד.</span></i>
In his travels he often visited Jerusalem and when he once saw a fox on the site of the Holy of Holies he wept bitterly. This was reported to the Roman authorities who considered it a sign of disloyalty and wanted to have him killed. But a Roman friend of Rabban Gamliel came to the gate of the academy and announced: “The man with the prominent nose is sought.” Rabban Gamliel understood the hint and remained in hiding for some time until a new government came to power.
While Rabban Gamliel was impeached from his office as Nasi, there began a special investigation of all the innovations which he introduced into Jewish life. The scholars gathered testimony from all people who saw or heard of the customs of previous generations. On that day there were adopted many rules on matters that were previously in dispute. In some matters the followers of the school of Hillel decided according to the opinion of the school of Shammai; other laws were given an entirely new interpretation. But no law that was previously disputed was left in doubt on that day.
Two of the laws that were discussed that day throw light on the opinions of the scholars and on their ability to adapt themselves to changed conditions. There is a text in the Torah which says that “an Ammonite or a Moabite may not come in the congregation of the Lord.” But these two nations were no longer in existence at that time and those who were still called by these names were derived from other nations who settled in these lands during the wars and the migration of nations.
On the day that Rabban Gamliel was impeached there arose one of the pupils, Jehudah the Ammonite proselyte, and asked: “What about me? May I mingle with the Jews?” Rabban Gamliel said that he must not, but Rabbi Joshua ruled to the contrary. When Rabban Gamliel insisted on the literal meaning of the text, Rabbi Joshua said to him: “Have the Ammonites and Moabites of old remained in their lands? Has not Sanherib confused the nations of the earth a long time ago?”
The explanation of Rabbi Joshua was accepted by all scholars and they permitted Jehudah, the Ammonite proselyte, to consider himself a Jew.
Another question concerned the inclusion of the Song of Songs and of Ecclesiastes in the Scriptures. The followers of the school of Shammai particularly objected to Ecclesiastes on the ground that the reader may misunderstand its words and may think that it has no religious message. Later Rabbi Akiba declared that there were no differences of opinion regarding the Song of Songs, for “all eternity is worth less than the day on which the Song of Songs was given to the Jews,” but the argument centered solely on Ecclesiastes.<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">Our scholars held varying opinions relative to the significance of some of the books of the Scriptures. Particular doubt was expressed regarding the books of Ezekiel, Proverbs, Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes and these were almost excluded from the Scriptures. The cause of these disputes are mentioned in numerous places in the Talmud but nowhere are they described in detail. From these it seems that the book of Ezekiel was objected to because of the description of the Divine Chariot whose mysteries must not be discussed before the uninitiated. The Talmud relates that a child (<span dir="rtl">ינוקא</span>) once pondered the subject of the light of the Divine Chariot and a fire descended from heaven and consumed the child. When the scholars discovered in Ezekiel contradictions to the Torah, one of them, Chanania ben Hiskia, pondered these contradictions so long that he used up three hundred jars of oil before he succeeded in explaining them. Of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes it was said, that they contradicted themselves and several verses in Eccleciastes were held to be deviations in the direction of heresy.</i>
An important regulation of Rabban Gamliel was that relating to the Sabbatical year. According to a previous rule it was prohibited to cultivate the fields even on the sixth year immediately after “Shavuoth.” Rabban Gamliel removed this restriction and permitted cultivation until the New Year. He also stabilized the prayers at three times a day. The exact order of the prayers, which were then accepted as taking the place of sacrifices, was determined in his academy. With the aid of two disciples, Simeon of Pakula and Samuel the Small, the order of “Shemone Esrei” was determined and it was ruled to be the duty of every Jew to recite these three times daily.
The benediction of God as the “builder of Jerusalem” was introduced into the blessings pronounced after eating. Rabban Gamliel also tried to determine the blessings to be pronounced over various kinds of food and, although his comrades did not agree with all of his definitions, he nevertheless consistently clung to his opinions.
The Roman government seems to have realized at that time that it would not subdue the Jewish people unless it could control its spirit. The government then sent two educated Gentiles, who were to pretend conversion, to study the Torah from Rabban Gamliel. The two arrived in Jabneh and studied everything. After they learned what they needed they declared that they were satisfied with the whole Torah except the rule that it is permissible to derive benefit from robbing a Gentile. Rabban Gamliel then ruled to prohibit this, for in doing so one dishonors the Jewish name.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי בבא קמא פרק ד׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i> Worthy of mention is also the regulation of Rabban Gamliel that every Jew must explain to his household the significance of Pesach, Matzo and the bitter herbs, else he has not fulfilled the duties of the day.
Rabban Gamliel also introduced a regulation regarding the Samaritans (referred to as Kuthim in the Talmud) whom the scholars tried to isolate from the Jews. After he assumed office Rabban Gamliel sought to amend the laws against the Kuthim out of a belief that it would be possible to bring them closer to other Jews. In the war against Rome the Kuthim sided with the Jews and fought side by side with them unlike the Idumeans who betrayed the Jews and frequently allied themselves with the enemy. The Kuthim were therefore looked upon more favorably, and although it was previously said that “whoever eats the bread of a Kuthi is like one who eats the flesh of a pig,” Rabban Gamliel declared that a divorce that was obtained through the testimony of a Kuthi was valid. He also considered grains bought from Kuthim to be “Demai” in the same manner as were grains bought from an “Am Haaretz.”<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">״דמאי״</span> are grains or fruits bought from an Am Haaretz concerning which there is doubt whether the tithe has been offered.</i>
Later Rabban Gamliel visited the cities of the Kuthim and he realized that they were not true proselytes and were far from Judaism. He then declared that their produce is “Vadai” (certainly untithed) from which tithes must be offered. He also prohibited Jews to eat meat of their slaughtering.
Rabban Gamliel strongly praised people who have an occupation. Seeing that many Jews will have to leave the soil and turn to trades because of the political situation, he said: “Whoever possesses a trade is certain of his existence, even as one is certain of a vineyard which is surrounded by a fence.”
Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Joshua became reconciled but nothing is known of the outcome of his dispute with his brother-in-law, Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus. We know of the excommunication but no mention is made of a reconciliation. The stories of the journeys of Rabban Gamliel frequently mention Rabbi Eliezer as a companion. While this may indicate a reconciliation, there is also another legend which says that the wife of Rabbi Eliezer, the sister of Rabban Gamliel, prohibited her husband from bowing at “Tachnun.” She feared that in doing so he would avenge himself on her brother. But once she forgot to observe him at prayer and he bowed at “Tachnun.” When she saw this she cried out that he had killed her brother. In the same instant Rabban Gamliel died. He was mourned by the whole people who called him “father” and his wife “mother.”

F<small>ROM WHAT WAS RELATED</small> in the previous chapter it is to be seen that Rabbi Eliezer was a man of firm convictions from which he would not deviate in the least. This tenacity caused him much trouble and brought him into conflict with the Nasi in spite of the family relationship which existed between them. He also came into disagreement with his comrades of the academy in Jabneh from which he was removed. Later he left Jabneh for Lud where he led an academy of his own founding and he could no longer return to the meetings of the Sanhedrin.
Rabbi Eliezer was a follower of the school of Shammai in his convictions. He was therefore called “Shamuti.” Since all the other scholars including the Nasi were adherents of the school of Hillel, Rabbi Eliezer was practically ostracized socially. When the question whether it is permissible to use a “winding oven” (<span dir="rtl">תנור של עכנאי</span>) was discussed, Rabbi Eliezer declared in the affirmative while all the others rendered a negative decision. On that day no decision of Rabbi Eliezer was adopted but he refused to reconsider his opinion and it is told that many miraculous events then took place upholding Rabbi Eliezer’s views. A carob tree became uprooted and was flung for a distance of one hundred ells from the place where it grew; a brook suddenly changed the direction of its current; the walls of the academy began to lean and a “Bath Kol” was heard from heaven declaring the correctness of Rabbi Eliezer’s views.<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">I have previously commented on the “Bath Kol.” Regarding the leaning of the walls of the academy in support of Rabbi Eliezer’s view, it is held by some that this was but an imaginative description of what took place. When, in desparation, Rabbi Eliezer turned to the pupils of the academy for support of his views, Rabbi Joshua scolded them saying that it was not for them to interfere in the dispute.</i>
But Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania firmly opposed Rabbi Eliezer and he said that no attention need be paid to the wondrous events. Regarding the “Bath Kol” he declared that the Torah was given for observance on earth and Heaven therefore had no right to interfere in disputes which take place on earth.
Then the scholars burned all those articles which Rabbi Eliezer declared to be clean and they voted on a punishment to be inflicted on Rabbi Eliezer for his stubborness. It was decided that all the scholars should have no dealings with him and Rabbi Akiba was chosen to inform him of the sentence. Rabbi Akiba donned a black garment and sat at a distance of four ells from Rabbi Eliezer. When Rabbi Eliezer asked him: “Why is this day different from all other days?” Rabbi Akiba answered: “Rabbi, I think that your comrades have abandoned you.”
Upon hearing this, Rabbi Eliezer tore his garments, he sat down on the ground and wept bitterly. It was said that the sorrow of Rabbi Eliezer was so great that all objects upon which his gaze fell immediately wilted.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא נ״ט ב׳.</span></i>
Among the disciples of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai, Rabbi Eliezer ranked highest and his master said of him that he was like a well lined with lime which does not lose a single drop of water and that if all the scholars were placed on one side of the scale and Rabbi Eliezer on the other side he would outweigh them all in wisdom. He also adopted the good qualities of his master of whom it was said that he never indulged in idle talk, he never walked even a distance of four ells without phylacteries and without studying the Torah, and he was the first to arrive at the academy and the last to leave. Although R. Eliezer conducted his own academy even before the destruction of Jerusalem, he never proclaimed opinions which he had not heard from his master. When such questions arose he commonly replied that he did not know the answer although he knew the accepted regulations very well.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוכה כ״ח א׳, יומא ס״ו ב׳, נגעים פרק ט׳ משנה ג׳.</span></i> In this relation he frequently said that whoever debates the decisions of his master or pronounces opinions which he has not heard from his master causes the “Shechina” to depart from the Jewish people.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות כ״ז ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Eliezer was a brother-in-law to Rabban Gamliel. He married the Nasi’s sister, the learned Ima Salim, of whom it is told that with her wisdom she confounded the injustice of a Gentile judge. But despite this family relationship Rabbi Eliezer frequently conflicted with the Nasi and with his colleagues. All of them became opposed to him and the harmony of the academy was disrupted.
Rabbi Eliezer was sometimes referred to as Rabbi Eliezer the Great, but wherever reference is made to R. Eliezer, without any other title, he was the person referred to. Among his disciples there was also Rabbi Akiba who, even after he attained the greatest position of leadership, never refrained from mentioning that he was a pupil of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Eliezer was also versed in the languages of the neighboring peoples and several times he accompanied Rabban Gamliel on the latter’s trips to Rome to plead the cause of the Jews.
Of the manner in which Rabbi Eliezer turned to learning it is told that his father was a wealthy man who owned many fields. The father together with the sons devoted themselves to the cultivation of the land and all of them were rude people, “Ame Arotzim,” who could not even recite the “Shema.” When he was over twenty years old, Rabbi Eliezer suddenly decided to leave the fields and to turn to study. He told his plan to his father and old Hyrcanus laughed at him and said: “Now you wish to study? Now it is time for you to take a wife and to beget children, then you can raise your children in the knowledge of the Torah.” But Rabbi Eliezer would not hear of this and decided to leave his father’s house at the earliest opportunity. When a cow, with which he was plowing, broke a leg he was afraid of his father’s punishment and fled to Jerusalem to Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai.
When he arrived in Jerusalem he declared his wish to study, but to all the questions that were put to him he could give no answer. Out of pity Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai permitted him to come to his academy even though he was so ignorant. But great was the astonishment of all when they saw his rapid progress. Having fled from his father’s house bare handed, Rabbi Eliezer had no money with which to buy food. In great hunger he began to chew earth and this caused his breath to become spoiled. Rabban Jochanan then questioned him regarding his origin and why he fled from his father’s house. When Rabbi Eliezer told him all, Rabban Jochanan provided him with food and seeing his great desire to learn he befriended him. Within three years Rabbi Eliezer became the outstanding pupil of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai.
Rabbi Eliezer’s father meanwhile met with difficulties and lost all his possessions. When he regained them after some time he learned that Rabbi Eliezer was engaged in studies in Jerusalem. Hyrcanus was then an old man and his sons said to him: “See what your son Eliezer did for you. When you were in difficulty he left you and went to Jerusalem to live in luxury, but when the inheritance will be divided he will take his share together with the rest of us. Even if you will write a will disowning him, it will not be heeded, for his master, Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai, will rule in his favor.”
To this Hyrcanus replied: “Do not be afraid, my children, for I will go to Jerusalem and on a Sabbath I will publicly announce that my son Eliezer has no share in my possessions.”
When Hyrcanus arrived in Jerusalem and Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai heard of it, he commanded that he be honored for the sake of his son and that he be seated among the greatest of the nation; he also commanded Rabbi Eliezer to expound the Torah on that Sabbath.
Old Hyrcanus was surprised to see his son, who till then had been an “Am Haaretz,” expound before the Nasi and all the scholars. His face glowed with pleasure and he was astonished when he saw Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai kiss Rabbi Eliezer on the head and heard him say: “Happy are the holy fathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob that one such as this was descended from them.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק ו׳, בראשית רבה פּ׳ מ״ב.</span></i>
After the lecture Rabbi Eliezer looked at the audience and he saw his father standing among the assembled. He ran up to him and said: “How could I expound the Torah while my father was standing up.” Hyrcanus then mounted a bench and declared: “Be it known that I came to Jerusalem with the special intention of disowning my son Eliezer and of disinheriting him after my death. But now that I see how all the scholars revere him I will assign to him in my will a portion double that of his brothers.” To this Rabbi Eliezer replied that he never prayed for fields or for silver and gold but only for the knowledge of the Torah and he therefore refused to take a greater share of the inheritance than his brothers would receive.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק ו׳ משנה ג׳, מדרש תנחומא פּ׳ לך לך.</span></i>
Rabbi Eliezer was by nature of a stubborn and harsh disposition as befits a person who would be a follower of Shammai. He did not allow his pupils to express their opinions of the law in his presence. When one of them once did so, Rabbi Eliezer remarked to his wife: “I will not be surprised if this person does not survive a year.” Later it so happened and that person died within the year. Rabbi Eliezer’s wife then asked him: “Are you a prophet that you could foretell his death?” but he replied, “I am not a prophet nor am I the son of a prophet, but I have received it from my teacher that one who pronounces sentence in the presence of his master has forfeited his life.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין ס״ג א׳.</span></i>
When Rabbi Eliezer became sick he was visited by Rabbi Akiba and his colleagues. Rabbi Eliezer sat in his garden bower and his visitors sat down at a distance of four ells. He turned to them and asked: “Why have you come?” and they replied: “We have come to learn from you.”
“Then why did you never come to me before?” he asked them, and they said, “We never had the time.” “Seeing that you never found the time to visit me till now,” he continued, “I would not be surprised if you meet with violent deaths.”
Rabbi Akiba then asked him, “I too?” and Rabbi Eliezer answered: “Your death will be more cruel than theirs.”
From this one can see that he never forgave any slight to his self-respect and it was also known that he never went out of his way to show kindness.
It is told that once Rabbi Eliezer approached the “Amud” (the pulpit of the cantor) to pray for rain and although he pronounced 24 blessings there was no rain. Later Rabbi Akiba rose and merely said: “Our Father, our king. We have no other king but You. Our Father, our king, do for Your own sake and have mercy on us.” A rain immediately began to fall. The scholars were displeased at this and a “Bath Kol” from heaven was heard saying: “Rabbi Akiba is not greater than Rabbi Eliezer, but Rabbi Akiba practices forgiveness and Rabbi Eliezer does not.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית כ״ה ב׳.</span></i>
Of Rabbi Eliezer’s moral maxims there remain the following sentences: “Let the honor of your friend be dear to you as your own; be not quick to anger and repent a day before your death; warm yourself at the fire of the wise and beware of their glowing coal lest you be scorched, for their bite is the bite of a fox and their sting is the sting of a scorpion, their hiss is the hiss of a serpent and all their words are like coals of fire.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק ב׳ משנה י׳.</span></i>
When the disciples of Rabbi Eliezer visited him during his sickness they begged him to tell them what to do in order to deserve the life of the world to come. He instructed them to “be careful of the honor of your associates and do not allow your children to ponder the logic of events,<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">In his will to his pupils Rabbi Eliezer used the words “prevent your children from reasoning.” (<span dir="rtl">מן ההגיון</span>) Rashi interprets these words to mean that children should not be permitted to study the prophets. Other commentators agree with the interpretation that it is meant as a warning against penetrating analysis of the logic of events.</i> but you should raise them in the presence of scholars. When you pray, remember before whom you stand. By virtue of all these deeds you will gain eternal life.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות כ״ח ב׳.</span></i>
Later he raised his hands to heaven and said: “I have learned much from my masters and also from others, but with all my learning, I have received from my masters’ knowledge no more than a dog who licks water from the sea and my pupils have taken from me as much as a pen absorbs when it is dipped in ink.”
As soon as he died Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania arose and declared: “Now the vow is rescinded.” Since the scholars vowed during the dispute with Rabbi Eliezer not to approach him within a distance of four ells, they considered this vow no longer valid after his death.
From this statement one may conclude that Rabbi Eliezer was not excommunicated but was merely isolated by a vow of the scholars, else he would not have been allowed to conduct a separate academy and the pupils of that academy would not have ranked with those of Jabneh, and when Rabban Gamliel died, Rabbi Eliezer sent all the pupils of his academy from Lud to Jabneh to participate in the funeral and the mourning.
When Rabbi Akiba heard of the death of Rabbi Eliezer he came all the way from Caesarea to Lud to attend the funeral; on his way he was flogging himself and when he arrived his whole body was bleeding. Later Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania came to the academy of Rabbi Eliezer and there he found a stone on which Rabbi Eliezer was in the habit of sitting while he taught. Seeing this stone Rabbi Joshua kissed it and said: “This stone is like mount Sinai and he who sat on it can be compared to the Ark of the Covenant.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שיר השירים רבה פּרשה א׳ פּסקא ב׳.</span></i>
Idolatry presented a very serious problem at that time. Since the temple was destroyed and the sacrifices were done away with, there were many Jews who felt that God had abandoned his people and they therefore turned to other gods. Rabbi Eliezer furiously fought against these deserters and he believed that it was necessary to uproot this evil. If a book of the Torah is found in a house of idol worshipping, he ruled that such a book must be burned since it is against the law to throw it away and because it became contaminated it could no longer be used.
Although Rabbi Eliezer was away from Jabneh for many years, there are many decisions of law quoted in his name as well as many legends about him. He was also praised as possessing the same qualities which were ascribed to his teacher Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai. During the sickness that preceded his death he was visited by four of the elders of the people: Rabbi Tarphon, Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah and Rabbi Akiba.
Rabbi Tarphon said: “You were better for the Jews than rain.” Rabbi Joshua said: “You were better for the Jews than sun.” Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah said: “You were better for the Jews than parents are for their children.” When Rabbi Akiba was ready to speak Rabbi Eliezer cupped his ear and said to those present: “Let us hear what Rabbi Akiba has to say of me.” But Rabbi Akiba said: “The dearest thing on earth is suffering.”
Then there came Rabbi Eliezer’s disciples and he said: “A great wrath has descended upon the world.” All the disciples began to weep, only Rabbi Akiba smiled. The disciples said: “Is it possible to refrain from weeping when one sees the Torah in suffering?” But Rabbi Akiba answered: “That is the reason why I laugh. Were my master not to suffer, it would seem that he has received the reward for his good deeds in this world. But since he suffers I am convinced that the reward for his good deeds is awaiting him and that he will receive it in the other world.”
Rabbi Eliezer was especially famous for the exactness of his knowledge which he received from his teacher. He often said that a person must study every subject with his pupil four times even as was done by the Jews when they were in the desert, for all the Jews learned from the Elders and the Elders learned from Aaron and Aaron learned from Moses and Moses learned the Torah from God. Study of the Torah is of such importance that one must not abstain from it at any time. Even the holidays must be devoted to this end, for only an “Am Haaretz” devotes his holidays to earthly pleasures, but a scholar must continue his studies; when one indulges in food and drink on a feast day it is only to the end that he may have more strength to devote to the Torah.
Of the significance of Rabbi Eliezer’s learning, Elisha ben Avuya once told that on the day of his <span dir="rtl">ברית מילה</span> his father prepared a feast and invited all the outstanding people of that time including Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua. After the food and drink, those gathered sang various songs and played a game of Alphabet. One would recite a verse of the Bible beginning with an Aleph and another immediately answered with a verse beginning with a Beth. Rabbi Eliezer then said to Rabbi Joshua: “While these people devote themselves to their affairs let us devote ourselves to ours.” They began to discuss various interpretations of the Torah and they derived as much joy from it as if the Torah had only then been handed down from Mount Sinai. A cloud of fire then descended from heaven and surrounded them. Elisha’s father said to them: “What are you doing? Would you burn my house?”, but they replied, “We devoted ourselves to finding new interpretations to the Torah which was given in fire.” Then said Avuya: “If the power of the Torah is so great I shall devote my son to it when he grows to be of age.”
Rabbi Eliezer held original ideas regarding the value of prayer. “Whoever prays at well defined times and according to a determined form,” he used to say, “his prayer is only a habit and does not derive from his heart.” Contrary to the opinion of Rabban Gamliel, he did not recognize the necessity of reciting the “Shmone Esrei” and he composed a shorter prayer. When one of the pupils once prayed before the pulpit and said the shorter prayers, his colleagues laughed at him but Rabbi Eliezer said: “Abbreviated as his prayer is, it is not as short as the prayer which Moses uttered for the cure of his sister which consisted of only five words.” Another time a pupil recited a long version of the prayers and he was ridiculed for their length, but Rabbia Eliezer said: “His prayers are no longer than those of Moses who prayed for forty days.” Then he continued: “There is a time for abbreviating one’s prayers and a time for extending them. The important thing is to recite the prayer according to the need of the time.”
Speaking of the same subject on another occasion he gave his interpretation of the words of God who said to Moses: “Why do you pray to me? Tell the Jews that they should advance.” According to Rabbi Eliezer God meant to say: “My children are in trouble. The sea has cut off their escape and the enemy is overtaking them. At such a time one must think of a means of salvation and not devote himself to prayer. Therefore tell the Jews to advance in spite of all obstacles.”
Like all his contemporaries, Rabbi Eliezer deeply mourned the destruction of Jerusalem and of the temple which he witnessed. He said: “Our forefathers permitted the roof of our sanctuary to be taken away while we allowed the walls to be razed. Every generation which does not see the temple rebuilt is like a generation which participates in its destruction.” He also said that three times every night God sits in mourning and roars like a lion over the ruins of the temple exclaiming: “Woe is me that I have destroyed my house and have exiled my children.”
At that time there prevailed a strong proselyting mood among the nations surrounding Palestine. Despite the fact that the Jews had lost all political significance, many Gentiles felt drawn toward the Jewish faith, intrigued by the stubbornness with which the Jews clung to it. Not a ray of light illuminated Jewish life and proselytes were being discouraged. Before one was admitted to the fold he would be asked: “Do you not know that Jews are persecuted everywhere? It is also very difficult to observe Judaism, especially for one who is not used to its rigors.” But there were many Gentiles who were not discouraged and even among the highest classes of Rome there were some who embraced Judaism. It therefore became necessary to devise new regulations for the new Jews. Before the temple was destroyed, Gentiles who undertook to observe the “seven commandments of the sons of Noah” were allowed to live in Judea and they were called “permanent proselytes” <span dir="rtl">(גר תושב).</span> But after the destruction only those were accepted as proselytes who undertook to observe Judaism in all its details. The Roman historian Tacitus ridiculed the proselytes and said: “It is impossible to comprehend what happened to many prominent Romans that they suddenly became filled with Jewish thoughts and agreed to have their flesh cut and to deny the gods of their forefathers.” The emperor Domitian then issued severe laws against those Gentiles who embraced Judaism and the Roman satirist Juvenal used his sharp wit against those who teach their children the belief in a God who is all spirit, whom no one has seen and who is not strong enough to protect his people and who is therefore concerned only that people should observe the Sabbath and should not eat pork.
One of these proselytes was a rich Roman matron named Bloria, who was well versed in the Scriptures and frequently addressed questions to Rabban Gamliel and to his disciples. Another proselyte was Aquilas (Onkelos), a scion of the imperial family who translated the Torah into Greek because the Septuagint version was by then imperfect because of falsification of its contents. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua approved this translation and an Aramaic version of it we possess to this day under the name of “Targum Onkelos.”
But despite such outstanding examples, Rabbi Eliezer did not approve of all proselytes and he maintained that there always existed a possibility that a proselyte would return to the Gentiles. When Rabbi Eliezer saw the suffering which the proselytes had to withstand at the hands of the Roman law he said: “Why is it that proselytes of this day are persecuted and have to suffer so much? This is probably because they do not show love for Judaism but only possess an unexplained fear.”
When Rabbi Eliezer declared that a man must repent a day before his death, his disciples asked him: “How can one know what day he will die on?” “That was exactly my intention,” Rabbi Eliezer answered, “that one should repent every day for fear that he will die on the morrow.”
Rabbi Eliezer considered a sword, a lance and a bow as decorations which a man may keep when going about on the Sabbath. He opposed teaching the Torah to girls and declared that whoever teaches the Torah to his daughter is like one who teaches his daughter foolish things. Wild beasts, he said, should be killed wherever met as against the opinion of the other scholars who believed that a wild beast should be killed only if it has done some harm. He also said that whoever eats the bread of a Gentile is like one who eats the flesh of a pig.
Rabbi Eliezer always elaborated on the events related in the Torah and, with poetic imagination, he embellished these events with wonders even greater than those which are described in the Torah. Of the ten plagues which, according to the Torah, were visited on Egypt before the deliverance of the Jews, Rabbi Jose of Galilee said that they prove that the Egyptians were afflicted with fifty plagues when pursuing the Jews to the sea. He bases it on the verse of the Torah which says that the ten plagues were a “finger of God” but when by the sea “the Jews saw the great hand of God”; consequently, if one finger caused ten plagues, the hand of God must have caused fifty. But Rabbi Eliezer was still unsatisfied and he discovered a text which proved that every plague consisted of four; he therefore concluded that the Egyptians were afflicted with forty plagues in Egypt and with as many as two hundred plagues by the sea.
He also said that the miraculous events which transpired by the sea were so great that even women slaves saw more than Ezekiel and all the other prophets. Moses’ song of praise which said, “this is my God and I shall glorify Him,” he considered as proof that every one saw God in person.
Concerning the Manna Rabbi Eliezer said that when it fell it remained suspended two ells above the ground and the Jews picked it from the air and not from the ground. Before it fell, Rabbi Eliezer said, a North wind would arise and cleanse the desert of sand; then a rain would descend to wash the earth; after the rain a dew would fall and spread like a cloth and on it the Manna descended.
Regarding the events at Mount Sinai the text of the Torah says that “all Jews saw.” Rabbi Eliezer declared this to indicate that there was not a blind man among all the people. When it is said later that everyone answered in unison, he interpreted it to signify that there was not a mute person in all the people; from the declaration of the Jews that they will do and hear as they are told, he concluded that there was not a deaf person among them and the verse which says that all the people stood at the foot of the mountain he interpreted to indicate that there was not a lame one among them.
Rabbi Eliezer greatly esteemed the worth of the Sabbath. He declared that whoever observes the Sabbath according to all the regulations will be spared three types of punishment—such a person will be spared the sufferings of the coming of the Messiah, the wars of Gog and Magog and the great “Day of Judgment.”
Concerning the duty to honor one’s father, Rabbi Eliezer related a story of a Gentile named Dama ben Nathina who possessed a diamond worth 600,000 shkolim which he wanted to sell for the “Ephod” of the High Priest. But when the priests came to buy it, Dama’s father was asleep and the key to the box which contained the diamond was under his pillow. Dama refused to waken his father even though this caused him a great loss. On another occasion Rabbi Eliezer said that the honor due to one’s father must be so unbounded that even were one to see his father throw a bag of gold into the sea, he must not question his action.

Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania

W<small>HENEVER THE OUTSTANDING DISCIPLES</small> of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai were enumerated, Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania was accorded second place. Rabban Jochanan himself referred to him as “the triple thread” because he combined within himself the virtues of Torah, wisdom and fear of God; on another occasion Rabban Jochanan is said to have exclaimed: “Happy is the mother who gives birth to such a son.” Rabbi Joshua’s mother well deserved this praise, for even before his birth she frequented the academies in order to influence the future of the child which she bore within herself with the spirit of the Torah. When Rabbi Joshua was still an infant, she was in the habit of bringing him in his cradle to the academy that he might absorb the words of the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי יבמות פרק א׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Joshua began his activities while the temple was still in existence and he served as a Levite among the “singers.” Years later he described the festival of the drawing of water which was then celebrated on the night following the first day of Succoth, and during which no one had any sleep because of the numerous ceremonies practiced. On the morning of the first day of Succoth everybody arose early to offer the daily morning sacrifice, then the Levites sang a hymn after which it was time to offer the special holiday sacrifice. Following this all went to the academy and then home to partake of the holiday repast, but before that could be consumed it was time again for the “Mincha” offering and then began the festivities of the drawing of water which passed in rejoicing and dancing until the early hours of the morning when it was time again for the morning sacrifice. Those who became exceedingly tired would lean on someone’s shoulder and nap while standing up.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוכה נ״ג א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Joshua was not favored with an attractive appearance<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית ז׳ א׳.</span></i> but he was gifted with great talent for studies and his teacher found him worthy enough to confide to him the greatest mysteries of the Torah. Legend relates that Rabbi Joshua was going on a journey with his comrade Rabbi Jose Hacohen on a hot summer day. On the way Rabbi Joshua began to expound the mysteries of the Divine Chariot and the sky suddenly became overcast with clouds, a rainbow appeared and angels gathered to hear his lecture even as people gather to a wedding.
When Rabbi Jose related this to Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai the latter exclaimed: “Happy are you and happy are the mothers that bore you. My eyes rejoice to see this. In my dreams I see us all sitting on Mount Sinai and a voice is calling to us to go farther where we will find great palaces and magnificent rugs will be spread before our feet and we shall take our place in the front rows among those who sit before the Shechina.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה י״ד ב׳.</span></i>
Together with Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, Rabbi Joshua aided his master Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai to flee from Jerusalem before its destruction and he then followed him wherever he went. He is always mentioned as second to Rabbi Eliezer, although he was a pupil of Rabban Jochanan before Rabbi Eliezer arrived, for when Rabban Jochanan invited Rabbi Eliezer to eat, he said that he had eaten with Rabbi Joshua.
Like his master Rabbi Joshua too did not greatly mourn the destruction of Jerusalem. Thus the Talmud relates<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא ס׳ ב׳.</span></i> that many Jews renounced the eating of flesh and the drinking of wine after the destruction. Rabbi Eliezer asked them: “My children, why do you abstain from flesh and wine?” and the people answered: “How can we eat when flesh is no longer offered on the altar and how can we drink wine when wine is no more poured on the altar.”
To this Rabbi Joshua replied: “You are quite right, my children. But if we should do as you say then we must also give up eating bread which is made out of flour, for flour is no longer offered on the altar; and if you will say that one can do without flour by eating fruit then must we also give up eating fruit, for the offering of the first fruit to the priest has been done away with; we should also give up drinking water because it is no longer poured over the altar.”
The people then remained silent not knowing what to answer and Rabbi Joshua continued: “If I were to say that we should not mourn at all that would be impossible, but one must also not surrender himself entirely to sorrow. It is necessary to mourn in such a manner that everyone should be able to bear it and that the mourning should not interfere with people’s lives.”
Very few legal decisions are quoted in the name of Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania and whenever he did pronounce a legal opinion he credited it to Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai or to some other teacher. Most of the time he was in opposition to Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, but despite these differences of opinion they were close friends for many years until the great dispute regarding the “winding oven” when they became separated.
Rabbi Joshua visited Rome and Alexandria several times together with Rabban Gamliel and other scholars on behalf of the Jewish people. It seems that he was favored by the Gentile scholars and rulers who disputed with him regarding Judaism. His wisdom was also appreciated and the emperor once asked him to tell him the dream which he saw that night. Knowing that the emperor was planning a war with the Persians Rabbi Joshua said: “In your dream you saw the Persians dragging you into captivity; they forced you to do hard labor and they beat you with a golden rod.” The emperor may not have had such a dream the previous night but after he brooded over this all day he saw this dream the following night.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות נ״ו א׳.</span></i>
Another time the emperor asked him why the Sabbath foods have such a pleasing aroma. Rabbi Joshua said to him: “We have a herb the name of which is Sabbath; this herb we mix with food and it improves its flavor.” “Will you not give me some of these herbs,” the emperor asked him, but Rabbi Joshua replied: “Whoever does not observe the Sabbath will get no benefit out of these herbs.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ט א׳.</span></i>
Like Rabban Gamliel and other scholars, Rabbi Joshua also knew the languages of the neighboring peoples, and for this reason he was frequently chosen to represent the Jews before the rulers. Once it became necessary to gain the intercession of a matron who was influential among the Roman rulers. The scholars then asked: “Who will go to that matron?” and Rabbi Joshua volunteered.
He went accompanied by several of his disciples and when they approached within a distance of four ells of the house, Rabbi Joshua removed his phylacteries and, entering the house, he closed the door behind himself and his disciples remained outside. When he emerged he bathed and then he went to finish the studies for that day.
Thinking that his disciples might suspect him of some evil he asked them: “When you saw me remove the phylacteries before entering the house, what did you think of it?” and they replied: “We thought, that you did not want to bring a holy object into an unclean place.” “And what did you think when you saw me close the door and leave you outside?” he further asked. His disciples replied: “We thought that you wished to discuss some political question.” “And when you saw me bathe after I left the house, what did you think?” he asked, and they answered him: “We thought you bathed because of the possibility that while speaking to her a particle of her saliva may have fallen on your clothes.” Then Rabbi Joshua said to them: “I swear to you that I did all these things even for the same reasons that you thought.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קכ״ז א׳.</span></i>
The emperor once said to Rabbi Joshua: “It is written in the Torah that God is just and that he rewards each one according to his deeds, then why are there so many blind, deaf and lame people who suffer without cause because they were born crippled before they had an opportunity to sin?” And Rabbi Joshua answered him: “God knows what he does and if he creates a person with some disability it is a sign that such a man is wicked and he is therefore punished in advance for his sins.” “But how can this be proved?” the emperor asked. “Give me,” Rabbi Joshua said to him, “two of your men as witnesses and a thousand golden coins and I will prove to you that what I say is true.” The emperor then gave him what he asked and Rabbi Joshua went together with the two men to a person who was born blind and he said to him: “The emperor commanded that I be put to death and I have a thousand golden coins which I want you to keep for me. If I will be killed the money will be yours, but if my life will be spared then you will return it to me.” The blind man answered: “It shall be even as you say.”
Then Rabbi Joshua gave the money to the man and three months later he returned together with the witnesses and said to him: “The emperor has spared my life and now I want you to return to me the money which I gave you to guard for me.” But the blind man answered: “What money have you given me? I know of none.”
Rabbi Joshua appeared to be angry and he brought the man before the emperor for trial, but even there the blind man denied that he had received money and when the witnesses testified against him he claimed that they were false witnesses. Then Rabbi Joshua said to him: “Woe to you, blind man, that you will in no way have any use of the money, for I have seen your wife entertaining another man and saying to him that as soon as the emperor will put you to death she will spend the money together with him.”
Upon hearing this the blind man immediately ran home and brought the money which he placed before the emperor. Rabbi Joshua then said to him: “Now you can see that our God was just when he made this man blind, for even in his blindness he is a criminal; how much more so would he have been if he could see.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תנא דבי אליהו זוטא פ׳ כ״ג.</span></i>
We remarked before that Rabbi Joshua did not possess a pleasing appearance but he was very wise, and the king’s daughter, who admitted knowledge, enjoyed discussing matters with him. Unable to restrain herself she once said to him: “Is it possible that such wisdom should be contained in such an ungainly vessel?” Rabbi Joshua said to her: “Why is it that your father, who is an emperor, keeps his wine in a clay vessel the same as all other people? Why does he not keep it in a silver or golden vessel?” The princess inquired of her father and he explained to her that good wine would soon spoil in a silver or golden vessel. She then understood what Rabbi Joshua meant to tell her.
Rabbi Joshua’s debates with the emperor are frequently mentioned in various Midrashim and the name of the emperor is given as Hadrian, who later permitted the rebuilding of the temple. According to the Midrash, this permission was obtained by Rabbi Joshua.
It is told that the emperor once said to Rabbi Joshua: “I am greater than your master Moses, for he is dead but I am alive.” To this Rabbi Joshua responded: “Can you decree that people should not light fires in their houses for three consecutive days?” “Yes, I can do so,” the emperor answered and he immediately issued such a decree. That same evening the emperor and Rabbi Joshua went out of the gates of the palace for a stroll and they saw smoke issuing out of a chimney. Rabbi Joshua said to him: “Look, even while you live, your commandments are ignored while our teacher Moses commanded many centuries ago that no fire be lit on the Sabbath and to this day no Jew will make a fire on Sabbath.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קהלת רבה פּרשה ב׳ פּיסקא ח׳.</span></i>
At that time disputes frequently occurred in a place called “Bei Avidan.”<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">The place of disputes between Jews and their opponents that was named “Bei Avidan” is mentioned in the Talmud a number of times. (Shabbath, 116; Avoda Zara, 17, etc.) The meaning of the name is not clear and it is also uncertain who the opponents were. Some would have it that <span dir="rtl">״אבידן״</span> is an erroneous form of <span dir="rtl">״אביון״</span> and that the disputes were with the Christians who were then called “Ebionim.” Others say it is the name of a Persian sect and the disputes were held with Persians.</i> The aim of these was to dissuade Jews from their faith. Rabbi Joshua attended these a number of times but later he stopped going. When the emperor once came to the disputing ground and did not find Rabbi Joshua there he later asked him why he was absent. In his usual allegorical fashion Rabbi Joshua answered him: “My mountain is already covered with snow and the foot of the mountain is bedecked with ice. My dogs no longer bark, nor do my grindstones turn, and when I walk it seems as if I search for that which I have not lost.” With these words Rabbi Joshua implied that he feels his age; his head is white as snow and his beard and moustache are grey as ice; his voice is hoarse and he has difficulty in speaking; his teeth can no longer chew and when he walks he is bent as if in search of something.
Hadrian, who later became relentless in his persecution of the Jews, once wanted to permit the Jews to restore the temple. This permission is said to have been obtained by Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania. But the emperor later changed his mind and rescinded his permission. Some historians maintain that the intervention of the Samaritans was responsible for this but others advance different reasons. The rescinding of this permission almost caused a new uprising but Rabbi Joshua calmed the enraged mob with an allegoric tale.
“The lion,” he related, “once choked with a bone which became lodged in his throat. He therefore announced throughout the land that whoever will remove the bone will be richly rewarded. The stork came and with its long bill it extracted the bone. When the stork demanded its reward the lion said to it: ‘You want reward? Is it not enough for you that you have been within the mouth of the lion and you have come out alive?’”
Hearing this story the people understood its moral and their rebellious mood was calmed.
From what we know of the activities of Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania we may conclude that he made friends easily; he reserved his decisions and based them on a desire for peace; he was ready to arrive at compromises with the other scholars in order to avoid disputes. Speaking of the disputes between the opposing schools of Hillel and Shammai he said that these were being carried too far and were like “filling a barrel full of oil and then pouring water into it to spoil the oil.”
Following the death of Rabban Gamliel, Rabbi Joshua apparently became the spiritual leader of the people. It is possible that because of his poverty he was not chosen Nasi, but since he headed his own academy in Pekiin and the Nasi of Jabneh was dead we may conclude that his importance was then of the highest.
Politically the period was one of commotion. This was the time of Trajan (Trachinus in the Talmud and Midrash) and Hadrian (Adrianus in the Talmud and Midrash) to whose name there was always added the curse <span dir="rtl">״שחיק טמיא״</span> (may his dead bones be ground). This period was therefore marked by constant decrees against the Jews and it was necessary to intercede continually in order to counteract their effects and also to keep a vigilant eye on what was going on among the Jews among whom rebellious moods began to rise as a result of these decrees.
As long as Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus lived his superiority was recognized by Rabbi Joshua as well as by the other scholars. But differences of opinion existed regarding the interpretation of various texts which deal with metaphysical matters or with the explanation of certain events in the history of the people as well as regarding future events during the advent of the Messiah and concerning the creation of the world, whether that took place in the month of Nisan or Tishri.
The belief was then accepted that every Jew is entitled to a share in the world to come and in the resurrection after he will pass the great Day of Judgment which will occur during the next redemption of the Jewish people. This belief grew out of observation that the fulfillment of some commandments, which is to be rewarded with long life, often entailed the immediate death of the observant.
Thus the Torah commands that “if you find on your way a nest of birds on a tree or on the ground containing birds or eggs you shall not take the mother with her offspring but you shall send the mother away and the offspring you may take for yourself in order that you may live long years. (Deut. 27:6, 7.) The same reward is also held out for the fulfillment of the commandment of honoring one’s father and mother: “Your years will be long and your portion will be good.” (Deut. 8:16.)
But it once occurred that a father said to his son: “Go to the pigeon roost and bring me some young doves.” The son did as his father commanded him and he also sent away the mother bird but on his way back he slipped and was killed. Then many people asked: “How could God do this since he promised in the Torah that these two commandments were to be rewarded with long life?” It was then explained that the reward was to be given in the future life and the text was interpreted to mean, “you shall enjoy this world which is perfect without pain and you shall live long years in the world which is eternal.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ל״ט ב׳, חולין קמ״ב א׳.</span></i>
The belief that all Jews have a share in the world to come or in the resurrection, Rabbi Eliezer interpreted to exclude non-Jews. Non-Jews, he said, were not even to be called for the Day of Judgment; but Rabbi Joshua maintained that the just men among the Gentiles would have a share in the world to come. According to Rabbi Eliezer, the people of Sodom, the generation of desert wanderers and the congregation of Korah were to be excluded from the resurrection and from the Day of Judgment but Rabbi Joshua was more generous to these sinners and although he conceded that they were ruled out from the world to come he claimed that they would be called to the Judgment Day.
A saying of Rabbi Joshua which he frequently repeated stated that an evil eye, an evil thought and hatred of mankind drive a man out of the world. He particularly believed in the importance of peaceful relations between people and he also said that “a pious fool, a clever wicked man, an abstaining woman and the plague of Pharisaism—these four types spoil the world.” It was asked, what is a pious fool? The answer was given that a pious fool is one who sees a woman drowning and would not save her for fear of touching her body. A pious fool was also one who sees a child drowning and does not save it because he has not yet removed his phylacteries. An abstaining woman was defined as one who renounces her husband and the joys of the world; the plague of Pharisaism was explained to mean such Pharisees who strike their heads against a wall to show their piety.
When Hadrian permitted the restoration of the temple there were found human bones in the place where the wood chamber of the temple used to stand and some scholars wanted to declare all Jerusalem to be unclean. But Rabbi Joshua said: “It would be a shame for us to declare our sanctuary unclean. What if dead bones were found? Can anyone tell where the victims of the flood came to rest? Or those slaughtered by Nebuchadnezzar? Or the bodies of those killed in all the wars that took place to this day? The sanctity of the Land of Israel has been declared for all times and even when Jews are in exile, it cannot be profaned by dead bones.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">זבחים קי״ג א׳.</span></i>
The frequent debates of Rabbi Joshua with the emperor and the philosophers (one group of these philosophers is referred to in the Talmud as the Elders of Athens) are embellished by all sorts of legends. Nevertheless they contain an important religious significance. The Elders of Athens, it is told, once asked Rabbi Joshua: “Where is the middle of the world?” Pointing to the place where he stood, Rabbi Joshua declared it to be the middle of the world, and when they asked him how he knew this, he told them to take a line and measure the distance to convince themselves. Attempting to confuse him the Elders said to him: “We have a well in the desert and we want you to bring it into the city.” But Rabbi Joshua said: “For that I need a rope of bran, for only such a rope can be used for moving wells.”
Again they said to him: “We have a torn mill and we want you to patch it,” but he answered that for this a thread of sand was needed. The Elders then asked him: “What should one use to cut a labyrinth of knives?” and he replied: “With the horn of a donkey.” Once two eggs were brought to Rabbi Joshua and he was asked which egg was laid by a white hen and which by a black one. Another time the Elders of Athens said to him: “When a bird dies, where does its soul leave it?” and Rabbi Joshua replied: “The soul leaves through the same place that it enters at birth.” And when they asked: “Is there a case of something being brought into a house with great effort and the effort should cause damage?” he said, “When you bring a rug into the house and in doing so you break the door.”
To the debates between Rabbi Joshua and Hadrian the following may be added. Hadrian said: “You say that God creates new angels every day to praise him and after they finish their praise they go away; I would like to know whither they go.” And Rabbi Joshua answered, “They go to the place where they were created. They go to the River of Fire which flows day and night even as the Jordan flows day and night, and this River of Fire comes from the perspiration of the sacred animals which carry the throne of Glory.”
Then Hadrian said: “I have noticed that God’s name is mentioned in the first five of the Ten Commandments but it does not occur in the other five. How can you explain that?” Rabbi Joshua retorted: “Why is it, that wherever one looks he sees your statue, but in those places where a person goes to relieve himself he does not find your statue?” The emperor answered, “It is not fitting to place my image in unclean places.” “Neither is it fitting to mention God’s name together with murderers, adulterers, thieves, false witnesses and other sinners who are the refuse of humanity,” Rabbi Joshua replied.
Once Hadrian said to Rabbi Joshua: “I would believe in your God if you would only show him to me that I might know Him better.” “I can do that easily,” Rabbi Joshua said, “If you would see my God I will show him to you.” He then led the emperor outside on a hot summer day and told him to look at the sun, but the latter declared that he could not do so, for the sun blinds his eyes. Then Rabbi Joshua said, “If you cannot look at the face of the least servant of God, how can you expect to see Him?”<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין נ״ט ב׳.</span></i>
Brilliant as were the retorts of Rabbi Joshua to the emperor and to the philosophers of Athens, he admitted that he was confounded—not by the emperor or a Gentile philosopher—but by a woman, a small boy and a girl.
Of how he was confounded by a woman Rabbi Joshua related in the following words: “Once I was lodging in a hostelry and the proprietress gave me beans to eat. I ate them all the first day and likewise on the second day. On the third day she put so much salt into the beans that I could not eat them. When she saw that I do not eat she asked why I don’t. I answered that I already ate. But the woman said to me: ‘If it is true, that you already ate, you would not have eaten the bread. There must be another reason for your not eating. You probably remembered that yesterday and the day before you left no “Peah”<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">Peah was set aside from the food eaten from plates as well as from the grain in the fields. When eating everyone was supposed to leave some of the food which was later given to the cook or to poor people.</i> from your food and you undoubtedly know that the scholars ruled that it is not necessary to offer Peah from the pot but from the plate.’”
“A little girl confounded me,” Joshua continued to relate, “when I was once going on my way and I had to cross a field. The little girl asked me: ‘Rabbi, is not this a field that you allow yourself to walk on it?’ But I said, it is a worn road. She said to me, “If this be a worn road then wicked people like you have made it so.’”
“A small boy confounded me,” Rabbi Joshua told, “when I was going on my way and I came to a place where the road separated. I asked the boy which way I should go to arrive at the city and he replied, ‘One way is shorter but longer, the other way is longer but shorter.’ I followed the road which the boy said was shorter but longer. When I approached the city I came to a place of gardens which I could not cross and I had to retrace my steps to follow the other road which the boy said was longer but shorter.”
With the death of Rabbi Joshua there ceased “wise counsel and good thoughts.” Rabbi Joshua was always victorious in his disputes with the opponents of the Jewish faith, and as he was dying the scholars said to each other: “Who will lead our disputes now that Rabbi Joshua is leaving us?”<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה ה׳ ב׳.</span></i>

Rabbi Eliezer of Modiin

D<small>URING THE DECADE FOLLOWING</small> the destruction of the Temple and until the uprising of Bar Kochba there lived in Palestine the Tana Rabbi Eliezer who exerted a considerable influence. His name is extensively associated with the legends of that time.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא י׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Eliezer was a native of the town of Modiin, which was also the birthplace of Mattathias the Hasmonean. According to a legend he died as a result of being booted by Bar Kochba, when the latter was told that Rabbi Eliezer sided with the Romans. The period was marked by revolutionary unrest not only among the Jews, but also among all the Asiatic nations which were dominated by Rome and moves toward national liberation were afoot everywhere. In an attempt to gain the confidence of the Jews and their assistance against the other nations, Hadrian permitted the restoration of the temple. The historical occurrences of that time are not entirely clear. One thing is certain, since it appears in all historical records, that after a revolutionary clash with the Romans, Hadrian came to new terms with the Jews and that the outstanding condition of this peace was the permission to rebuild the temple.
But this permission he later rescinded when he abandoned his friendly attitude toward the Jews. By means of various legal amendments, the previous edict allowing the restoration of the temple was made to naught. The first move was to order the selection of a new site for the temple, later an alteration of the dimensions, to differ from those of the old temple, was ordered and the least possible number of Jews were to be employed in the work of reconstruction. When all the imperial caprices were finally complied with and work began, flames appeared from under ground and frightened the laborers away. This phenomenon, which was caused by an accumulation of gases in the ruins since the time of destruction, was interpreted as a sign of God against the work.
The conduct of the emperor enraged the populace and the rebellious sentiments which were seething beneath the surface broke out in the form of open revolt. Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania at first restrained the revolutionary outburst for a time, but when Rabbi Akiba became the spokesman for the revolt, it burst out in full force under the leadership of Simeon ben Kochab of Kezib.
It remains uncertain whether any other scholar besides Rabbi Akiba joined Bar Kochba, but we do know that Rabbi Eliezer of Modiin, who was an uncle of Bar Kochba, opposed the rebellion of the Jews. As long as the war of rebellion lasted, Rabbi Eliezer fasted and prayed that God should save the remnant of the Jews from extermination. Since everyone was convinced of the invincibility of the Romans, Rabbi Eliezer refused to sanction the warlike efforts of his nephew. This was interpreted as indicating sympathy with the Romans and in an outburst of anger Bar Kochba once booted Rabbi Eliezer who instantly died from the blow.
The story of the details of this occurrence relates that Rabbi Eliezer was standing deeply immersed in prayer, when a Samaritan came up to him and whispered something in his ear, but Rabbi Eliezer did not even notice his presence. This was reported to Bar Kochba who questioned Rabbi Eliezer regarding the subject of his conversation with the Samaritan, but Rabbi Eliezer did not know what to answer.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי תענית פרק ד׳ הלכה ה׳, מדרש איכה רבתי פּרשה ב׳ פיסקא ד׳.</span></i> When the Samaritan was caught and questioned he admitted that he spoke regarding the surrender of the city to the Romans.
Rabbi Eliezer of Modiin was a pupil and a friend of Rabban Gamliel II. It seems probable that he also conducted an academy of his own, but since he was an authority on the Hagadah, he was frequently invited to Jabneh to offer his interpretations. Rabban Gamliel was in the habit of hearing the opinions of all the other scholars and then he would remark: “We still must hear from the man of Modiin.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת נ״ה ב׳.</span></i> The others were displeased at this and once remarked to Rabbi Eliezer: “How long will you continue to heap words on us?”
Rabbi Eliezer of Modiin devoted himself largely to preaching; he also said that the meaning of the word “Hagadah” was the same as “flowing,” for the legendary interpretations of the historical events and of the texts of the Scriptures flow into one’s consciousness like water. When he preached, his words caressed the ears of the listeners with a gentle grace which aroused the noblest feelings and he stimulated the fantasy of his listeners with poetic imagery.
A maxim of Rabbi Eliezer which he often repeated said: “He who profanes the Sabbath and desecrates the festivals and shames his associate in public and breaks the covenant of our father Abraham and misinterprets the Torah, even though he possess Torah and good deeds, he has no share in the world to come.”
This maxim characterizes his trend of thoughts and was probably also meant as a condemnation of the various sects which appeared at that time and which profaned the Sabbath, desecrated the festivals, broke the covenant of Abraham and falsely interpreted the Torah. Like most of his contemporaries, Rabbi Eliezer also considered the observance of the Sabbath as the most important element of the Jewish faith. “He who does not observe the Sabbath has no portion in the world to come,” Rabbi Eliezer said, but if the Jews were to observe the Sabbath as it should be observed, God would bestow upon them the following six gifts: the land of Israel, the world to come, a new world order, the re-establishment of the kingdom of David, the priesthood and the Levites.
The developing sects among the Jews at that time began to criticize the Hebrew script. We already described before, that the Jews had two types of script, the square Assyrian and the Phoenician which was used by the Samaritans. In the attempt to isolate the Samaritans from the Jews, Ezra the Scribe selected the Assyrian script to be used exclusively by the Jews. The opponents of the Torah then began to criticize this script saying that it is derived from a foreign nation. Rabbi Eliezer declared that the square Assyrian script was the original script of the Torah and he based his statement on texts from the Torah and from Megillath Esther.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספתא סנהדרין פרק ד׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Eliezer was opposed to the uprising of Bar Kochba. The wars of Bar Kochba seemed to him to be altogether too natural. He awaited a redemption which should be characterized by miracles and he held that one must hope for it but must not attempt to hasten such a redemption violently. When he was asked regarding the prophecy that Jerusalem shall become the gathering place of all the nations, how it would be possible for one city to contain all the nations, he explained that God would command the city to extend its boundaries to include all people.
The trend of thoughts of Rabbi Eliezer was illustrated by his saying that the book and the sword were handed down from heaven at the same time. God said: “If you observe the Torah, you will be spared from the sword, but if you will not observe its commandments you shall be destroyed by the sword.” Rabbi Eliezer frequently debated the meaning of various texts of the Torah with Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania and he loved to find hidden meaning whenever the wording of a text was unusual, or there was a superfluous word or some word was lacking. Rabbi Joshua, on the contrary, sought the simple meaning of texts and attempted to find a rational explanation.
Rabbi Eliezer thus sought for secrets and mysteries in order to create fantastic embellishments for historical events. Even the miracles that were related he found insufficient and attempted to magnify them as, for example, in the case of the Manna which he declared heaped up to a height of sixty ells.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא ע״ו א׳.</span></i>
Other events he saw in a poetic light. When God gave the Torah to the Jews, he said, all the kings shuddered in their palaces. The thunder and the lightning on Mount Sinai confused them and the blast from the Shofar, which the angels sounded, nearly deafened them. They then gathered to Balaam and asked him: “Is this not a repetition of the flood?” But Balaam answered: “Foolish people. God swore to Noah long ago never again to bring a flood.” “Possibly He meant that He would never cause a flood of water to devastate the earth, but He may bring a flood of fire,” they continued asking. Balaam reassured them, “He will bring no flood either of fire or water. The commotion which you witness today is due to the fact that God is this day giving the Torah to Israel.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">זבחים קט״ז א׳.</span></i>
He also said that whenever Jews depend on the intercession of the merits of their forefathers, which are beloved of God, they will be aided and will be victorious over their enemies. This idea he employed in explaining the events of the wars with Amalek as well as the feeding of the Jews in the desert with meat. By means of these additions to the miraculous events he sought to encourage people and to strengthen them in the face of the vicissitudes of the dispersion. This policy he continued even when his colleagues disagreed with him.

Onkelos (Aquilas) the Proselyte

I<small>T HAS BEEN POINTED OUT</small> numerous times that even while the Jews were in a state of political subjection, while their land was devastated and the enemy triumphed and there reigned the belief that their God has forsaken them, even at that time there were many people of high estate who gave up their careers and entered the Jewish people as proselytes. One of these was Onkelos the son of Kalonymos, or Aquilas, as he is referred to in some places, who was closely related to the emperor Hadrian.<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">The name Aquilas closely resembles Onkelos in the Palestinian pronounciation. The “Ain” is pronounced as a nasal sound and resembles a “Nun.” The stories related in the Talmud and Midrashim regarding Onkelos are substantially the same as those told in other places regarding Aquilas. The main difference is in that the Babylonian Talmud relates Onkelos to Titus and Rabban Gamliel the elder, which would indicate that he lived at the time of the destruction of the temple, while Aquilas is connected with Hadrian and Rabban Gamliel of Jabneh which would indicate that he lived after the destruction. Some historians are therefore of the opinion that Onkelos and Aquilas are two different persons. But the Gaon of Vilna believed that they were the same person and he corrected (<span dir="rtl">גטין נ״ו</span>) to read: “the son of the sister of Hadrian” instead of “the son of the sister of Titus.”</i>
The story of how Onkelos (Aquilas) turned to Judaism is related in the following manner:
Aquilas (or Onkelos) was the nephew of emperor Hadrian and wanted to become a proselyte. He greatly approved of the Jewish faith. (Others say that he was brought to this conviction by a Jewish girl.) But he feared his uncle and once he said to him: “I would gladly engage in commerce.” Hadrian replied, “If you lack money, my treasury is always at your disposal.” But Aquilas continued, “I want to journey throughout the world and to meet many men, I therefore want your advice as to what merchandise I shall take.” To this Hadrian replied: “If you see merchandise which is fallen in price, deal in it, for it will surely rise again and you will gain thereby.”
Aquilas then went to Palestine and began to study with Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus and Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania. Sometime later he returned to Hadrian and his uncle asked him: “Why is your face so changed? It is obvious that you have suffered losses; or has someone done you harm?” But Aquilas-Onkelos answered, “Neither.”
Then Hadrian said, “You are my kin and I am pained at your poor appearance,” and Aquilas-Onkelos declared, “I have learned the Jewish Torah and I have become a Jew.”
Greatly shocked Hadrian exclaimed, “Who permitted you to do so?” Aquilas-Onkelos answered, “You told me to do so. When I asked your advice what merchandise I should trade in, you told me to get all merchandise which is depreciated, for it would surely rise in value again. I searched among all nations for a people which had fallen lower than the Jews but I found none. I therefore bethought myself that they are sure to rise to heights again.”
This conversation was witnessed by one of the emperor’s ministers who praised Aquilas’ step. The emperor was angered at this and struck his minister. Out of shame that minister leaped from the roof of his house and killed himself.
Hadrian persisted in trying to find out the cause of Aquilas-Onkelos’ conversion until the latter told him, “I wanted to know the Jewish Torah.” “But you could have learned it without embracing Judaism,” the emperor wondered, but Aquilas-Onkelos replied that a non-Jew can never comprehend the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מדרש תנחומא פּרשת משפּטים.</span></i>
There are several versions regarding the conversion and one of them relates that when the emperor heard of it he sent a few soldiers to bring Aquilas back to Rome, but he explained to them a number of verses of the Torah and they too were converted. The emperor then sent other soldiers to bring him back and commanded them not to engage in any discussion with him. When the soldiers took Aquilas-Onkelos and were ready to leave, he said to them: “Let me tell you one thing; among people it customary that the one of lesser rank lights the way for those of higher rank, but my God is the greatest and still he lights the way that people may see where to go.” Upon hearing this, these soldiers too became converted. The emperor then sent soldiers for the third time and commanded them neither to speak nor to listen to what Onkelos may tell them. As they were emerging from the house with him, he placed his hand upon the Mezuzah and said to them: “See the difference between a human ruler and the great God of Israel. A human ruler stays within his house and his guards stay at the gate, but here the people stay inside the house while the king stays at the door to guard them.” Hearing this these soldiers also became converted and the emperor sent no more soldiers to bring Onkelos back.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה י״א, א׳.</span></i>
When Onkelos spoke to the Roman soldiers, or on other occasions compared the ways of God to the deeds of human rules, it was entirely in accord with the concepts of that time. The emperor was then looked up to as divine. Instead of drawing a parallel between an idol, which the king worshipped, and God, as the author of the Psalms did, it became customary at that time to compare the conduct of a human ruler with that of God.
Still another version of the story of Onkelos’ conversion relates that Onkelos bar Kalonymos was a nephew of Titus (or of Hadrian as the Gaon of Vilna claims) and wanted to embrace Judaism. With the aid of witchcraft he had Titus aroused from his grave and he asked him: “Which is the worthiest people on earth?”, Titus replied, “The Jews are.” Onkelos then asked, “What would happen if I were to join them?” and Titus said, “Their teachings are too great and it is impossible to observe them. If you want to gain greatness there is no better way than by oppressing the Jews.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין נ״ו ב׳.</span></i>
The Midrash relates<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ע׳ פּיסקא ה׳.</span></i> that before Onkelos became converted he came before Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus and asked him: “Do you think it is worth while for a person to embrace Judaism if God only offers the proselyte divine love and bread to eat and a garment to wear?” Rabbi Eliezer was greatly angered by this question and answered: “Is it not enough for a proselyte that he receives that for which our father Jacob prayed. To him God offers it as a gift, is not that enough?” But this answer did not satisfy Onkelos and he asked the same question of Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania. Rabbi Joshua responded kindly and said: “The bread which God offers to the proselyte is not ordinary bread but the Torah. And when it is said that God will give the proselyte a garment to wear, no ordinary garment is meant but the Talith of wisdom. If the proselyte is worthy enough to learn the Torah he deserves the Talith of a scholar and he may marry his daughter to a priest and her sons may become High Priests.” Later the scholars said that if Rabbi Joshua had not spoken so kindly to Onkelos he would probably have returned to the Gentiles.
In later years it was told of Onkelos that when he praised the virtues of God he said that even at the creation of the world God showed that his way was different from that of human rulers. A human ruler generally allows his goodness to be praised before he has achieved anything and before he has established courts or built public baths. His name is mentioned before his deeds. But of God the deeds are mentioned first and only then follows the praise.
According to the Christian Church-fathers, Onkelos was an adherent of Christianity first and Hadrian sent him as the representative of the government to Jerusalem where new decrees were then issued almost daily. At first the Jews were permitted to restore the temple, later it was commanded to convert the city to pagan purposes and its name was changed to “Aelia Capitolina” in honor of the Roman god Jupiter. But since Onkelos devoted himself to astrology, which the Christians considered as sinful, he was disowned by them and he turned to Judaism.
For those Jews who lived in the Greek speaking countries and did not know Hebrew but who wanted to acquaint themselves with the content of the Torah, there then existed a Greek translation of the Bible which was known as the “Septuaginta” or the translation of the seventy. But by that time this translation was considerably falsified and it included incorrect interpretations of various Biblical texts. Onkelos-Aquilas undertook to make a new translation which he accomplished with the consent of Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus and Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania. They later characterized it as an introduction of the beauty of Japheth (Greece) into the tents of Shem.
According to the Jerusalem Talmud, Aquilas was a colleague or a pupil of Rabbi Akiba, and he is said to have sanctioned the new translation of the Bible into Greek. Onkelos’ translation of the Bible became accepted among all the scholars and the Jerusalem Talmud quotes tens of words as Onkelos translated them in order to establish the meaning of various verses. It is also told that as a recognition of his authority in explaining the Bible, Hadrian consulted Onkelos in elucidating a certain text.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי חגיגה פרק ב׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
Today we possess an Aramaic version of Onkelos’ Greek translation (Targum Onkelos) which has become sanctified almost to the same degree as the Hebrew Bible text. When the Christian Church-father Hieronymus later translated the Bible into Latin he extensively used Onkelos’ Greek translation. Commenting on it he said that it was a poor translation because “the translator slavishly followed the Hebrew text and translated literally without taking into consideration the Greek language and its syntax.” The Jews adopted the translation of Onkelos, Hieronymus said, and some Jewish communities which employed Greek as the spoken language read Onkelos’ translation on the Sabbath instead of the Hebrew text of the Torah or they read both versions.
Onkelos’ conversion apparently occurred after the destruction of Jerusalem during the time that Rabban Gamliel II was Nasi, for Onkelos is frequently mentioned together with Rabban Gamliel. Thus it is told that they were both in Ascalon and Rabban Gamliel performed his ablutions in an ordinary bath house. But since Ascalon was considered to be outside the boundaries of the Land of Israel, Onkelos considered an ordinary bath house there to be unclean and he bathed in the sea instead.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספתא מקואות פרק ו׳.</span></i>
When Rabban Gamliel died the Talmud relates that Onkelos burned sixty pounds of incense at the funeral, as was customary during the funeral of a king. When he was asked by the scholars why he did so, he replied, “In my eyes Rabban Gamliel was more important than a hundred Roman kings.”
Aquilas-Onkelos was very pious and although the temple no longer existed he observed all the regulations of cleanliness which pious Jews observed when the temple was still in existence. When Aquilas-Onkelos inherited the wealth of his father he refused to derive any benefit from the golden and silver idols and cast them into the Dead Sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספתא דמאי פרק ו׳.</span></i>

Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah

F<small>ROM WHAT WAS SAID</small> in the previous chapters it is to be seen that the material position of the Jews continually deteriorated due to the political circumstances. The Roman officials oppressed and persecuted the population to the limit of their ability. Property was stolen and any opposition was considered as treason against the state and was punishable by death. There was no authority from which to seek redress. The way to Rome was long and difficult and by the time one decree was rescinded another one was issued and negotiations had to start from the beginning to have its effects ameliorated, or a new governor would be appointed who would start his reign with a wave of persecution.
The country then sank into deep poverty. For this reason so much was spoken of the wealth of Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah and it was said that only the tithe of the newborn cattle which he offered amounted to twelve thousand calves a year. Others said that whoever sees Rabbi Elazar in his dream is to take it as a sign of coming wealth, and when Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah died it was said that wealth departed from the learned.
The primary source of Rabbi Elazar’s wealth was the inheritance which he received at his father’s death, but he also engaged in commercial enterprises and traded in wine and oil despite the prohibition of the scholars against trading with the necessities of life in Palestine. It was said of Rabbi Elazar that he was charitable and whenever he found a person who was willing to study but did not possess the means for his sustenance, he supported him. But in spite of his charities Rabbi Elazar said that no person should give away more than one-fifth of his possessions for charity.
During the dispute with Rabban Gamliel II, which was described before, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah was chosen Nasi. The reason why he was chosen from among other candidates who may have been better qualified for the office was because it was believed that he would easily relinquish the office in case of a reconciliation with Rabban Gamliel. In addition he was also respected because of his great wealth and his aristocratic origin. Rabban Gamliel was a descendant of Hillel the Old, five generations removed, who was a scion of the House of David. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah was a tenth generation direct descendant of Ezra the Scribe.
When Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah was chosen Nasi he was still a very young man—according to tradition he was only 17 or 18 years old. Feeling grieved because of his youth and afraid that the people would not respect him because of it, he arose one morning to find that eighteen rows of gray hair had appeared overnight. (According to the Jerusalem Talmud Rabbi Elazar was really seventy years old when he exclaimed “I am like a man of seventy.”) But it is certain that despite his youth Rabbi Elazar was well versed in Halacha. His learning he probably gained from his father who was a scholar of such renown that even his brother was always referred to as Simeon the brother of Azariah.
In praise of Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah he was likened to a “basket full of incense” and to a dealer in perfumes who comes to a city and everybody gathers around him asking: “Have you good oils? Have you essence of roses?” and they find that he has all of these. Even thus the scholars came to Rabbi Elazar and whatever they sought they found with him. If they asked a question about the Torah he answered from the Torah; if he was asked about the Mishna he answered from the Mishna; the same with exposition, law or legend. He knew them all and possessed all knowledge.
In later years Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah was often found in the company of Rabban Gamliel. They travelled together with other scholars in the interests of the people. Although he was no longer Nasi, he accompanied the leaders of Jabneh whenever he was asked to do so, and for this reason it was said that a generation which can boast of a Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah should not be considered an orphaned generation.
Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah especially excelled in exposition. He was careful not to break up the text into its component words and letters but clung to the realistic interpretation of the verses. He compared the Torah to a plant: just as a plant grows even so do the words of the Torah. When he noticed that the people were losing their confidence and respect for the scholars because of the differences of opinion which prevailed and that whenever one of them declared a thing to be clean some one else would declare it to be unclean, he said: Whenever scholars differ in the interpretation of the Torah and seemingly contradict each other, for one says clean and the other unclean, one prohibits while the other permits, it must not be concluded that there is any doubt about these questions, for all these opinions are derived from the same Torah. It is necessary to listen closely and with open heart to try to understand all that is said by those who declare a thing to be clean as well as by those who declare it to be unclean, by those who permit as well as by those who prohibit.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספתא סוטה פרק ז׳.</span></i>
It is told that Rabbi Akiba often tried to draw Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah to his own method of exposition, but Rabbi Elazar said: “Akiba, what have you to do with Hagadah? Finish your speech and return to pondering the laws pertaining to plagues.” On another occasion Rabbi Elazar said to Rabbi Akiba: “Even if you were to speak to me all day I would not be persuaded.” Altogether different were the relations between Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah and Rabbi Eliezer of Modiin who exerted a great influence on his method of exposition. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah even adopted some of the latter’s sayings such as, “Whoever profanes the festivals is like one who worships idols.”
Of the teachings of Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah particular significance should be attached to those of his maxims which lay down a practical foundation for man’s moral and religious obligations. He said, “All those sins which a man commits against God are forgiven on the Day of Atonement, but sins which are committed by man against man are not forgiven on the Day of Atonement until the man who was sinned against forgives his malefactor.”
“He who listens to gossip or gossips about others,” Rabbi Elazar said, “may be compared to a person who bears false witness against his neighbor and should be severely condemned.” And commenting on the Biblical injunction to reprimand a person who had committed some wrong, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah said: “I doubt if there exists a man today who knows how to reprimand his neighbor properly.” Regarding God’s prohibition of the eating of the flesh of a pig Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah said, “One must not say, ‘I am disgusted with it and therefore I cannot eat it’, but one should rather say, ‘I would gladly eat of it but my Father in heaven has forbidden me.’”
God rewards every good deed even when the doer had his personal benefit in mind. Thus the Egyptians kept the Jews in Egypt for their own benefit, nevertheless God commanded that no Egyptian be put to shame, for we were permitted to live in their land. We must therefore forget the hard labor with which the Egyptians oppressed the Jews and must only remember their generosity in allowing us to live in their country.
It was natural for Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah to value highly the observance of the Sabbath, nevertheless he said that whenever human life is at stake the Sabbath may be disregarded. Speaking of the significance of the commandments he concluded that the commandments were like the roots of a tree while the study of the Torah could be compared to its branches. He said: “One whose wisdom is greater than his deeds, what is he like? He is like a tree whose branches are many and whose roots are few and the wind comes and uproots it and turns it on its face. But one whose deeds exceed his wisdom, what is he like? He is like a tree whose branches are few and its roots are many and even though all the winds that are in the world come and blow upon it they stir it not from its place.”
There are few statements of Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah regarding the Jews as a nation, but one expression is characteristic of his outlook. Pertaining to this subject he said: “It is written in the Torah, ‘You have this day chosen me as your God and I have chosen you as my people.’ By this God meant to say, ‘You have given me one title and I have granted you one title. Even as you believe that I am the only God in the world so do I believe that you are one people in the world. God is one for his people Israel and Israel is the only people of God.’”
An important question under discussion at that time was the commandment of “Yibum” and “Halitza.” The Torah commanded that if a man dies childless it shall be the duty of his brother to marry the widow. If the brother refuses to do so he must grant the widow “Halitza.” At that time there arose the question what to do in case the widow refuses to marry her deceased husband’s brother. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah ruled that if the brother has some defect which would make him socially undesirable he may be forced to grant “Halitza” to the widow instead of marrying her.
When it was once remarked that a Sanhedrin which issues a death sentence once in seven years should be designated as a “bloody” Sanhedrin, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah added that even if a death sentence is issued once in seventy years it is a murderous deed.
The last days of Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah marked the beginning of the great rebellion. The scholars then left Jabneh and the academy was disbanded. Rabbi Elazar went to Sephoris and the Sanhedrin moved to Usha. The Talmud relates<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה ל״א ב׳.</span></i> how the Sanhedrin wandered from Jabneh to Usha and then back to Jabneh. Later it left Jabneh a second time for Usha and thence to Shfarom and other places. Rashi attempts to explain these wanderings by saying that the Sanhedrin followed wherever the Nasi or his son settled. When other historians accepted this explanation they became confused in the sequence of events. What is more likely is that the Sanhedrin left Jabneh due to the persecution of the Roman government and not in order to follow the Nasi. At that time the Jews had no Nasi. Rabban Gamliel II was dead and the people feared to elect a new Nasi because the Romans disapproved of this office whose holders were looked up to as scions of the royal House of David and were therefore accorded royal honors. The people looked upon the Nasi as a Jewish king who was being interferred with by the Gentile rulers. At the time that the Sanhedrin moved to Usha, it may be assumed that the Roman government already came to the conclusion that they would never subdue the Jews as long as they observed the Torah. This also seems to be the reason why the Romans allowed every people to cling to its god as long as they paid their taxes to the government while at the same time they undertook to annihilate the Jewish people through the annihilation of the Torah.
As was remarked above, we cannot now determine the exact years of the wanderings of the Sanhedrin and whether it visited Usha twice or the repetition was merely an error of the copyists. It is also unknown whether the sessions of the Sanhedrin in Usha were officially sanctioned or they took place secretly. Usha was a city in Galilee situated between Acco and Safed. During the constant revolutionary struggles of that time it is possible that the Roman government had no control over this city or that the military governor overlooked the actions of the Jews. This supposition may explain the transfer of the Sanhedrin from Jabneh to Usha.
It is certain that no cases affecting life were discussed there. But it was necessary to introduce various new rules which were necessitated by the times. Life continued in its development and the moral and material circumstances of the time required new regulations. It therefore became imperative to meet in order to determine various innovations.
Regarding the convocation at Usha it is told that a call was sent out to all the elders of Galilee that “whoever is learned shall come to teach others and whoever is not learned should come to learn.” Great numbers of people, responded to this call and when the time came for them to depart they said: “This place received us in such a friendly manner, should we leave it empty?” They therefore honored Rabbi Jehudah bar Elai who was a native of the city with an office although he was not the greatest of the scholars but because “the place adds to the honor of the man.”
The people who gathered in Usha are referred to in the Talmud as the “wanderers to Usha” because they were men who lived elsewhere. In bidding farewell to the scholars who returned to their homes Rabbi Jehudah ben Elai said, “May God reward you for your effort in coming here, for one had to come ten miles, another twenty; one came a distance of thirty miles and another forty in order to hear the words of the Torah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שיר השירים רבה פּרשה ב׳.</span></i>
We bring some of the most important regulations which were adopted by the Sanhedrin in Usha as characterising those times.
Since every man must provide for his children when they are small and cannot earn their own bread, it was decided that every father must provide for his son until the age of thirteen and for his daughter until the age of twelve. Because of the persecutions of the government, many men were forced to flee their homes. This regulation—the responsibility of the father toward his children—was a hint that one may not leave his family, and if one is forced to save his life by flight he must first provide for his wife and children.
If a man wills his property to his children, the heirs must support the father and mother as long as they live, and also the small children which were not included in the will. Until that time, any person who distributed his property to his heirs during his life time lost all rights to it and had to depend on the generosity of his heirs for his support.
Due to the great need which prevailed among the people there were some individuals who denied themselves all worldly pleasures and distributed all their possessions to the poor. The assembly at Usha ruled that even one who is used to giving much for charity must not give more than one-fifth of his possessions and after that not more than one-fifth of his annual income.
It was ruled that a father should deal kindly with his son until the age of twelve. If, after the age of twelve, the son refuses to obey his father, the latter was entitled to chastise him with a whip or to refuse him food.
If a woman brought to her husband <span dir="rtl">״נכסי מלוג״</span> (property which belonged to the wife exclusively but the fruits of which the husband could enjoy) and then she sold this property during the lifetime of her husband, the husband was entitled to claim the property after his wife’s death.
The law of possession was also defined at this gathering (Chazakah). Just as an ox who gored three times was to be legally considered as a dangerous beast and its owner was to be punished according to the law, thus also, if a man held an article for three years, he gained the right of possession to it.

Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha

O<small>N THE HISTORIC DAY</small> that the scholars of Jabneh revolted against Rabban Gamliel and elected Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah as Nasi, there was present among those gathered one, Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha, who participated in the discussions and the decisions of that day.
While still a child he was arrested by the Romans. It is unknown for what transgression he was thus punished. Also unknown are the circumstances of his death. His name is therefore frequently confused with that of his grandfather who was known as Ishmael the High Priest and who was killed before the destruction of the Temple together with Rabban Gamliel the Elder.
The story of how Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania ransomed Rabbi Ishmael from captivity is told in the following manner. Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania was visiting a certain large Roman city in the cause of his people and he was told that within the prison there was a beautiful black eyed, curly headed Jewish boy who was held captive and was to be sold to some degenerate lascivious Roman. Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania approached the prison to speak with the boy and he began with a verse from Isaiah (42:24): Who gave Jacob to the looters and Israel to robbers? The boy responded with the second half of the verse, It is God, against whom we have sinned refusing to follow in his ways and to obey his teachings.
When Rabbi Joshua heard this he remarked: “I feel certain that this boy will grow to be a teacher in Israel. I therefore swear that I will not move from here until I have ransomed this boy for whatever money may be asked.”
Rabbi Joshua ransomed the boy from captivity and before long he became a teacher among the Jews. This was Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין נ״ח א׳, ירושלמי הוריות פרק ג׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>
In later years Rabbi Ishmael was a pupil of Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania, Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus and Rabbi Nehunia ben Hakana. All the scholars came to call him “brother” and when he debated the interpretation of some text with Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, the latter said to him: “Brother Ishmael, you can uproot mountains with your wisdom.”
Rabbi Ishmael showed the greatest reverence for his teachers. Only with Rabbi Akiba did he differ on occasions in the interpretation of Biblical texts. Rabbi Ishmael followed his own system in expounding the Scriptures and he often said: “The Torah used the language of ordinary people.” He therefore maintained that no particular significance need be ascribed to seemingly superfluous words which occur in the Scriptures. Rabbi Akiba, on the other hand, counted the letters of every word and sought hidden meaning in the slightest dot.
Rabbi Ishmael held to a definite system in his studies, and like Hillel the Old, he also established thirteen rules according to which the Torah is to be explained.
Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha was descended from a priestly family and the legends refer to him as “High Priest” although he lived after the destruction of the Temple when there could be no high priests. When Rabbi Ishmael said: “I swear by the vestments of my father and by the golden headpiece between his eyes”<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספתא חלה פרק א׳.</span></i> he probably referred to his grandfather, for we find numerous occasions where grandfathers are called “father.”
The permanent residence of Rabbi Ishmael was in the village Aziz in southern Palestine. From there he frequently came to Jabneh to participate in the deliberations of the Sanhedrin. This custom he also followed after the Sanhedrin moved to Usha. When he was asked about his ancestral home he said that it was desolate, for the people of his town settled monetary disputes before one judge only and they also tended sheep in the Land of Israel which was then prohibited.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספתא בבא קמא פרק ח׳ הלכה י״ד.</span></i>
On the occasion of the death of his sons, the greatest scholars of the time (R. Tarphon, R. Jose of Galilee, R. Elazar ben Azaria and R. Akiba) came to console him. Before entering the house, Rabbi Tarphon warned them to be careful of every word they said, for Rabbi Ishmael was renowned for his scholarship and it was necessary to speak carefully to him. As they came in, Rabbi Ishmael greeted them with the following words: “When a man sins, he is overcome with sorrow and must disturb his superiors.”
Data regarding the death of Rabbi Ishmael is extremely confused. There is a legend that (Rabbi) Ishmael the High Priest was one of the Ten Martyrs. He is considered to be identical with Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha. But one must bear in mind that none of the High Priests were ever entitled Rabbi. It seems that the grandson’s title of Rabbi was ascribed to his grandfather and the martyrdom of the grandfather was ascribed to the grandson.
The Talmud relates that once, when R. Ishmael the High Priest was performing the service in the Temple on the Day of Atonement, he went into the Holy of Holies and there he beheld the face of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ז׳ א׳.</span></i> On another occasion he is said to have been revealed mysteries by Suriel, the Angel before the face of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות נ״א א׳.</span></i> It therefore seems certain that these legends deal with the grandfather of Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha. We have previously related that during the reign of Agrippa II there officiated a pious High Priest named Ishmael ben Phabi who later complained to the Roman authorities about the king. Some historians maintain that Ishmael ben Phabi was the grandfather of Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha. This, however, is hardly plausible since Ishmael ben Phabi died a natural death and did not suffer martyrdom.<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">“Phabi” was a Greek name and signified “light”, the same as Meir and Nehorai. Since many Jews of that time possessed two names, one Greek and one Hebrew, it is possible that the High Priest Ishmael ben Phabi was called in Hebrew Ishmael ben Elisha.</i>
The High Priesthood, which some legends ascribe to Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha, may be explained by the fact that he was considered worthy of occupying the office of his grandfather. Since everybody then looked forward to a speedy restoration of the temple, it was probably said that Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha was the outstanding claimant to the office and thus came to call him “High Priest.”
It is told that when Rabbi Ishmael and Rabbi Simeon (not designated more clearly) were led to execution, Rabbi Simeon said to Rabbi Ishmael: “Rabbi, my heart quivers with fear, for I do not know for what sins I am being executed.” Rabbi Ishmael answered him: “Did never a man come to you to ask a question or to settle a dispute and you made him wait until you finished drinking your water, or lacing your shoe or wrapping your shawl about yourself? By doing so you have transgressed against the commandment of the Torah not to cause suffering to a widow or an orphan which is punishable by death irrespective of whether the suffering caused was great or small.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכילתא פּרשת משפּטים.</span></i>
The same story is related in a similar form but with a clearer designation of the names of the participants:<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק ל״ח משנה ג׳.</span></i> When Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel was being led to execution he thought of his past deeds and exclaimed: “Woe to us, that we are led to execution as if we were the greatest criminals who deserve death.” Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha answered him, “Possibly it is so because poor men waited at your door and were not admitted while you ate?”, but Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel replied, “I swear by Heaven that I never acted so. On the contrary, whenever I ate I had guards posted outside to bring in all the poor people who should happen to pass that they too may eat with me and praise God.”
As they approached the place of execution, each one of them begged of the guard to be executed first. Rabbi Ishmael said: “I am a Priest, the son of High Priests and I must not see my comrade killed.” Rabban Simeon said, “I am a Nasi, the son of a Nasi. Do not let me see the death of my friend.”
If Rabbi Ishmael was executed together with Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel, then this could have happened only before the destruction and he could have been no other than the grandfather of Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha. But in other places it is said that Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha also suffered martyrdom and it is told that when Rabbi Akiba heard of his death, he rent his garments and exclaimed to his disciples: “We must now prepare for calamity.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכילתא פּרשת משפּטים.</span></i> It is also said in the Talmud,<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות נ״ז ב׳.</span></i> that whoever sees Rabbi Ishmael in his dream must expect some calamity to befall him.
A maxim of Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha was the following: “Be submissive to the ruler, patient under oppression and receive everyone with cheerfulness.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק ג׳ משנה י״ב.</span></i> It is also known that in any dispute between man and wife Rabbi Ishmael took the part of the wife. He used to say: “Jewish daughters are beautiful but poverty destroys their beauty.” At his death it was therefore said that Jewish women should bewail his passing away even as king David exclaimed when mourning the death of Saul.
Rabbi Ishmael always heeded the simple meaning of the Biblical texts. When he debated this question with Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus he exclaimed: “As I see it, you would have the simple meaning of each verse preceded by your exposition of it.”
Rabbi Ishmael also established the rule that there is no prior and no latter in the Torah. The chapters of the Torah were not written according to the chronological order of the events, and when some statement is repeated, this repetition must be considered a sign that a new meaning is intended. The legal regulations, he believed, must be in accord with the text and in case of contradiction between the accepted law and the text of the Torah, the law must be made to conform with the Torah. Only in three instances did he recognize the validity of laws which were at variance with the Bible.
In Deuteronomy (12:3) God says to Moses and Aaron to tell the Jews that each should take a lamb for the Paschal offering. Rabbi Ishmael asked: “Is it possible that both heard the words of God and that both spoke to the Jewish people?” But he explained it to mean that when Moses spoke, Aaron listened attentively to what he had to say, and it was considered as if both heard the words of God.
In case an ox gores a man and kills him, it is possible that the animal is known to be dangerous and that its owner has been warned and would therefore have to forfeit his life together with the beast. Nevertheless the Bible offers the owner of the animal an opportunity to redeem himself by the payment of a sum of money. (Exodus, 21:30.) Of such a case Rabbi Ishmael said: “Here we may see the great mercy of the Creator who permits a man to redeem himself with money from a well-earned punishment.”
If a man owned a Jewish slave and freed him at the end of six years, the Torah commanded that the slave should not be sent away empty handed but that he should be given gifts from the herd, the threshing floor and the wine cellar. (Deut. 15:14.) Rabbi Ishmael said, “Come and see how great is the mercy of the Creator who says to a man, ‘If a Jewish slave has worked for you and you send him away empty handed, he will have to beg from door to door or he will be forced to sell himself into slavery again. It is better that you give him some of that with which God has blessed you that he should not have to beg or to sell himself to another master.’”
Mourning for the destroyed Temple occupied a central place in the thoughts of Rabbi Ishmael even as it did with all his colleagues. He said: “Since the Temple is destroyed, it were better not to eat flesh nor to drink wine, but such a decree could not be complied with. It is the same with marriage. So long as Rome rules the Jews with severe decrees and does not allow us to observe all the commandments of the Torah, it were better that no Jew should marry and bring children into the world. But in doing so the seed of Abraham would be annihilated.”
As was mentioned above, there exists no certain information concerning the death of Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha and there is also no substantiation for the legend which relates that a son and a daughter of Rabbi Ishmael the High Priest were sold into slavery to two Roman nobles who attempted to marry them to each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין נ״ח א׳.</span></i> Whether this event happened to Ishmael the High Priest and contemporary of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel the Elder or it occurred to the children of Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha who was the pupil of Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania and the friend of Rabbi Akiba remains unknown.
Worthy of mention is the Talmudic legend<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה י״א ב׳, חולין קכ״ג א׳.</span></i> concerning the death of Rabbi Ishmael the High Priest. Because of his great beauty Rabbi Ishmael was loved by the emperor’s daughter and at his execution she begged that his head be given to her. She later removed the skin from the head and she had it preserved. It was also said that once every seventy years a man of Rome was chosen and the head of Rabbi Ishmael was placed on him, sometimes the king himself tried on the skin of Rabbi Ishmael’s face or placed his head upon himself.
From all these legends we can gather that the political situation during the lifetime of Rabbi Ishmael was a sad one and became worse as time went on. The Sanhedrin could no longer meet even in Usha and the academy of Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha became the center of Jewish spiritual life. Whatever was discussed in that academy later became immortalized in many sayings and decisions of the pupils of Rabbi Ishmael who repeated his moral and legal teachings during his lifetime and after his death.
The location of the academy has not been determined but it apparently was situated in a region over which the Roman government had no control. The Roman rulers had, by that time, discovered the secret that in order to rule Palestine they must suppress the Jewish religion. It was then prohibited to observe the Jewish faith and the maintenance of an academy was punishable by death. A law was also promulgated that if any scholar ordains (Semicha) a pupil, both the teacher and the pupil were to be executed.
Of the legal and moral teachings of the school of Rabbi Ishmael, some possess permanent ethical value and may be used as examples for all times. Other decisions of the school mirror the political and social conditions of the land. The following are instances of the latter: “Whoever lives for forty years without suffering should take it as a sign that he has received his share of peace and should be satisfied,”<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערכין ט״ז ב׳.</span></i> or: “One may add a measure of ground salt to a basket of grain without being guilty of deception, if together they are sold for the price of grain because the grain is thereby saved from worms.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ל״א א׳.</span></i> The same may be said of the opinion which was rendered that in time of danger it is permissible to write a bill of divorce and to hand it to the woman even though the writer does not know the man.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות קכ״ב ב׳.</span></i> Commenting in this sentence Rashi says that it refers to such cases as that of a man who fell into a well and he shouted that whoever hears his voice should write a bill of divorce. In such a case one may believe the man that he is the person that he claims to be, for if he disbelieved the opportunity may be lost and his wife may remain an “Agunah” for life.
It may well be imagined that the Jews suffered at that time from spies and false reports which were carried by people against each other. The school of Rabbi Ishmael therefore ruled that spreading slanderous reports is a sin of the same magnitude as worshipping idols, immorality or blood shed.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערכין ט״ו ב׳.</span></i>
Other significant teachings of Rabbi Ishmael’s school were the following:
If you see a scholar committing a sin at night, you should not think of it the following day, for he has probably repented. Nor must you doubt it, for he has certainly repented. This rule, however, applied only to corporeal sins. Where money was involved it was necessary to ascertain that the money had been returned.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות י״ט א׳.</span></i>
He who wishes to be unclean, is permitted to do so; he who wishes to become clean must be aided. One who sells kerosene and spices may be taken as an example. If a customer desires kerosene, he tells him, “Go, please, and fill the container yourself.” But when a customer comes to buy spices, he says to him, “Let us measure it together that we may both enjoy its fragrance.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא ל״ט א׳.</span></i>
When God was angry at the sin of the spies, he relented after Moses’ prayer and said “I have forgiven according to your words”. (Numbers, 14:20.) The meaning of this is that when the Gentiles will hear of it they will say: “Happy is the pupil whose teacher agrees with his words.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ל״ב א׳.</span></i>
God’s words are like fire and like a hammer which crushes rocks. (Jer. 23:19.) Just as a hammer crushes a rock into many pieces even so can God’s word be explained in seventy languages.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת פּ״ח ב׳.</span></i>
In order to use clean language the Scriptures employed six words instead of one as in the case of Sam. I, 20:26. Man must learn from it to form his language in the same manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים ג׳ א׳.</span></i>
Four times a year God sits in judgment over the world: On Passover He judges the fate of the harvest of grain; on Shavuoth He judges the fate of the fruit of the trees; on Succoth the amount of rain during the coming year is determined. Man is judged on Rosh Hashana and his sentence is signed on the Day of Atonement.<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה ט״ז א׳.</span></i>
In the conduct of the world, it is a law that the innocent may atone for the guilty, but the guilty may not atone for the guilty.<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא מ״ג ב׳.</span></i>
If two people engage in a fight, the Bible says that he who beats his friend shall heal the victim (Ex. 21:20). This indicates that it is permissible to engage in healing the sick.<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ס׳ א׳.</span></i>
If you are accosted by the <span dir="rtl">״יצר הרע״</span> (evil desire) drag him into the school. If he is hard as a rock, he will be ground; if he is strong as iron he will be crushed.<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוכה נ״ב ב׳.</span></i>
How do we know that the “Schechinah” is omnipresent? It is said, “When the angel that spoke to you went out another angel came to meet him.” (Zechar. 2:7) Since it does not say that the other angel left after the first one, but that he came to meet him, we may conclude from this that the “Schechinah” is present everywhere.<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא כ״ה א׳.</span></i>
God commanded that during the offering of the burnt sacrifice the priest must wear one garment while burning it and another when carrying out the ashes. (Lev. 7:4) This verse means to teach us proper conduct. The garments which one wears while preparing food for his master must not be worn while filling his beaker.<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ד א׳.</span></i>
When the Bible commands man to be generous to the poor in order to gain the blessing of God, it employs the word “Biglal”. (Deut. 15:10) The use of this word shows us that fortune is like a wheel which constantly turns. One day fortune smiles on one, the next on another.<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קנ״א ב׳.</span></i> (A play in words is here engaged in. <span dir="rtl">״בגלל״</span> means in order that; <span dir="rtl">״גלגל״</span> means a wheel.)
Why is the lobe of one’s ear soft while the rest of the ear is hard? So that he may stuff his ear with the lobe when he hears something unworthy.<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ה׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Whoever gives from his possessions for charitable purposes is saved from Gehenna. It is like the case of two sheep that have to cross a stream, one of which is shorn while the other is not. The shorn sheep wades through the water while the unshorn one remains behind.<sup class="footnote-marker">30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ז׳ א׳.</span></i>
In the case of a day laborer the Bible says: “You shall give him his wage the same day before the sun sets for he is a poor man”. (Deut. 24:15) But there is no difference whether the wage of a man, an animal or the rent for borrowed vessels is concerned. All must be paid for on the same day and their wage must not be held overnight.<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא קי״א ב׳.</span></i>
When the Bible says, “a man or a woman who commit a sin” (Numbers 5:7) it intends to show that in the eyes of the Torah a woman is punishable for her sins the same as a man.<sup class="footnote-marker">32)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים מ״ג א׳.</span></i>
Friday noon the Shofar was blown six times as a sign that the Sabbath was beginning. At the first blast of the Shofar, all men who were in the fields ceased working. Then all men came from near and far and gathered before the gates of the city so that they may enter it together. The stores were meanwhile still open but the bolts for the doors were held in readiness. After the second blast of the Shofar it was necessary to lock the stores but the pots still remained in the ovens. The Shofar was blown a third time after which all pots were removed from the ovens and candles were lit. After that the people waited a period of time which it takes to bake a small fish, or to place the bread in the oven and then three blasts of the Shofar were blown at once and the Sabbath began.<sup class="footnote-marker">33)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ל״ה ב׳.</span></i>

Rabbi Tarphon

A <small>REMARKABLE</small> and unusual personality of that time was Rabbi Tarphon. The name Tarphon is derived from the Greek, Tryphon. He is mentioned once by that name in the Jerusalem Talmud. The period of his influence and activity extended from the destruction of the Temple until the destruction of Betar.
Rabbi Tarphon was descended from a priestly family and he told that once, while pronouncing the benediction together with the other Priests, he bent close to the High Priest in order to hear him pronounce the express name of God and he was seized by a great terror.<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">The “Shem Hamforash,” the express name of God, is the name JHVH, which was forbidden to be pronounced. Only the High Priest could pronounce it on the Day of Atonement, and even then he melodiously whispered it so that others might not hear it. In later years the Mishna ruled that whoever pronounces the name of God according to the manner in which it is written loses his share in the world to come. Before that time the scholars taught the Name to their pupils only once in seven years. (Kidushin, 71.) Later it was entirely forbidden. The Talmud says that Rabbi Chananiah ben Teradion was punished because he taught his pupils the “Shem Hamforash.” (Avoda Zara, 17.) In passing it is worth mentioning that the form in which Gentile Bible critics read the “Shem Hamforash” is certainly incorrect. In ancient times the Name probably combined the vowel dots of Adonai and Elohim, but the correct form has been forgotten.</i>
On another occasion, when the question was discussed whether the singers in the Temple must be without fault even as the Priests were required to be, Rabbi Tarphon swore that he remembered his uncle, his mother’s brother, who was lame and nevertheless blew a trumpet in the temple while the Levites sang. Rabbi Akiba asked him whether it was not a special festive occasion when such a thing would be permitted. Rabbi Tarphon replied: “It is as you say. It is remarkable that I witnessed it but forgot the nature of the occasion while you were not there yet you know what happened.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי יומא פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
What happened to Rabbi Tarphon at the time of the destruction and how he escaped the city is unknown. Later he settled in Lud and often came to Jabneh to participate in the sessions of the Sanhedrin. He was also present on the memorable day when Rabbi Gamliel was impeached. But he did not figure as a candidate for the office of Nasi despite his wealth and his great scholarship that was so extensive that whenever he sat with other scholars and someone came to ask a question he was the first to express an opinion.
As a scholar he was named “the father of Israel,”<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי יבמות פרק ד׳ הלכה י״ב.</span></i> and every time that a dispute arose regarding some law he was very severe in his expressions. He frequently invoked old traditions with an oath that “if it is not as he says then may he lose his children.” When, after such an oath, Rabbi Akiba said to him: “I think that you have heard wrong,” Rabbi Tarphon conceded his mistake and said: “Akiba, whoever departs from you is like one who departs from life.” Whenever Rabbi Akiba saw a person who did not show proper respect for Rabbi Tarphon, he was ready to punish him severely. Thus it is told that one of the pupils, Jehudah ben Nehemia, once asked Rabbi Tarphon a difficult question which he could not answer. Rabbi Akiba said to that pupil, “Your face is joyous that you have asked the old man something which he could not answer. I shall therefore not be surprised if you will not live long.”
The legend further relates that this occurred sometime before Passover, and when the scholars gathered again on Shavuoth, Jehudah ben Nehemiah, no longer lived.
But we must not conclude that such occurrences of Rabbi Tarphon’s inability to answer questions happened frequently, for his learnedness was likened to a heap of nuts.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ס״ז א׳.</span></i> The meaning of this simile is explained<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק י״ח.</span></i> in this manner—just as several other nuts roll from the heap which is disturbed when one nut is taken away, so also Rabbi Tarphon responded to questions; he immediately adduced proof from the Scriptures, the Midrash, the Mishna as well as from Halachah and Hagadah.
Although the Temple was no longer in existence, Rabbi Tarphon continued to gather tithes from all those who would offer them. Rabban Gamliel once met him in the morning and asked why he was absent from the academy on the previous day and Rabbi Tarphon replied that he was occupied with the “service”. Greatly surprised, Rabban Gamliel said: “Your words make me wonder for you say that you were engaged in service, but I do not know of any service that had to be performed on that day.” To this Rabbi Tarphon answered, “The eating of the tithes by a Priest in a city in the Land of Israel is like performing the service in the temple.”
When Rabbi Tarphon accepted tithes, he did so not out of poverty, for he was a wealthy man. He evidently followed the custom in order to give the people an opportunity to fulfill the commandment of offering tithes; he also never distinguished between the givers and accepted tithes from all. Nevertheless he was not gredy and although he was not a spendthrift he generally returned the sums which he received for “Pidyon Haben” in his capacity of a “Cohen”.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בכורות נ״א ב׳.</span></i> To aid the people during a time of famine, he exercised his priestly prerogative and married three hundred wives (!) in order that as wives of a Priest they might partake of the tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספתא כתובות פרק ה׳ משנה א׳, ירושלמי יבמות פרק ד׳ הלכה י״ב.</span></i> In telling this story the Jerusalem Talmud employs the word <span dir="rtl">״הערים״</span> to indicate that he tricked the law.
In public Rabbi Tarphon always conducted himself modestly, so that no one should recognize him outside of the academy and that he should derive no benefits because of his knowledge of the Torah. Only once did he reveal his identity in order to escape a beating. As he was trying to take some fruit from his own vineyard, the watchman caught him and was going to beat him. Rabbi Tarphon exclaimed: “Woe to Tarphon that he is caught as a thief.” The watchman recognized him and released him and since then Rabbi Tarphon was wont to say, “Woe is me that I have made use of the crown of the Torah”.
Constant differences of opinion regarding interpretations of the commandments existed between Rabbi Tarphon and Rabbi Akiba, but this did not mar the great friendship by which they were bound. Rabbi Tarphon once gave to Rabbi Akiba a sum of money with which to buy a field in order that they should have a permanent income and should be able to devote themselves to the Torah exclusively. Rabbi Akiba took the money and distributed it to the poor scholars.
This story is related in two versions. According to one version<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מסכת כלה רבתי פרק ב׳.</span></i> Rabbi Akiba said to Rabbi Tarphon: “If you wish, I will buy for you a village or two.” Rabbi Akiba took this money and distributed it to the poor. Sometime later Rabbi Tarphon met Rabbi Akiba and said to him: “Where are the villages that you were to buy for me?” Rabbi Akiba took him by the hand and led him to the academy where he distributed the money.
The other version relates<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ויקרא רבה פּרשה ל״ד פּיסקא ט״ז.</span></i> that Rabbi Tarphon gave to Rabbi Akiba six hundred measures of silver and asked him to buy a field that they may both derive an income and be able to devote themselves to study. Rabbi Akiba distributed the whole sum to the scribes and the students of the academy. Some time later Rabbi Tarphon asked, “Have you bought the field of which I told you?” When Rabbi Akiba said that he had bought the field, Rabbi Tarphon asked if he could see it and Rabbi Akiba showed him the scribes and students to whom he gave the money.
Characteristic of Rabbi Tarphon’s outlook was the occasion when he sat together with other Elders in Lud and they discussed the question of what is of greater importance, study or the fulfillment of the commandments. Rabbi Tarphon said that observance of the commandments was of greater importance. Rabbi Akiba maintained that study is more important and the other scholars concurred with the opinion of Rabbi Akiba, for “learning leads one to the observance of the commandments.”
This opinion, that observance of the commandments is of the highest importance, is also expressed in other statements of Rabbi Tarphon who compared the relationship of man to his Creator to the relationship existing between a laborer and his employer. There exists one of his maxims, for instance, in which he says: “The day is short and the work is great and the laborers are sluggish, the wages are high and the master is urgent.” He also said, “It is not incumbent upon you to finish the work, nor are you free to avoid it. If you have learned much Torah you will be well rewarded and your master is trustworthy that he will pay you your wages.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק ב׳ משנה ט״ז.</span></i>
Speaking of the observance of the commandments, Rabbi Tarphon was led to speak of work in general. He then said that God did not permit the “Schechinah” to rest among the Jews until they completed the work of building the tabernacle. He also said that a man may die from idleness.
Rabbi Tarphon generally embellished his speech with expressions from the Torah which in his mouth assumed a new significance. Wishing to express approval, he exclaimed <span dir="rtl">״כפתור ופרח״</span> (a buttan and a bloom); to show disapproval he said, “my son shall not go with you” as an indication that he does not care to indulge in dispute and to express openly his disagreement.
A bitter struggle was then being waged against the early Christians who were Jews and Rabbi Tarphon was their severest opponent. He engaged in disputes with them in an attempt to dissuade them from their beliefs. This fact is also mentioned in the writings of the Christian Patriarch, the martyr Justinus. Rabbi Tarphon then said: “May I lose my children if I would not burn their books, together with the mention of God that is made in them, if only I could obtain them.”
It has been remarked that Rabbi Tarphon frequently exclaimed, “May I lose my children if this is not thus and so.” He did lose some of his children and his wife also died. Remaining a widower and the father of children, he chose the sister of his wife for a bride, and after the funeral of his wife he said to her: “Go feed the children of your deceased sister.”
It is also necessary to note the great respect in which Rabbi Tarphon held his mother. It is said that she once lost a shoe and descended barefoot to search for it and Rabbi Tarphon placed his hand under her foot that she may not hurt her foot while stepping on the bare ground.
It is to be assumed that Rabbi Tarphon lived more than seventy years. Traditions vary regarding his death. Some maintain that he was one of the Ten Martyrs while others deny it.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מדרש איכה רבתי פּרשה ב׳.</span></i>
To the nature of Rabbi Tarphon’s character it should be added that despite his angry disposition he nevertheless said, that if he were a member of the Sanhedrin at the time that it had a right to condemn people to death there would not have been a single death sentence passed.

Rabbi Jose of Galilee

T<small>HE DISTRICT OF</small> G<small>ALILEE</small> in northern Palestine was inhabited by non-Jews throughout the period of the existence of the first temple. Only in later years, during the times of the second temple, did Jewish settlements begin to extend into Galilee as the density of the population in the rest of the land increased. The emigrants who left the cities of Judea to settle in Galilee were mostly people poor in economic and spiritual resources, and there developed in Galilee a native type of “Ame Aratzim.” When these men of Galilee visited Jerusalem and later Jabneh, or some other city where the Sanhedrin resided, they were ridiculed for their childish naivete and were frequently called “Galilean fools.” The inhabitants of Galilee were also easily recognized by their manner of speech and by their uncouth behavior and the opinion was commonly held that Galileans are fools incapable of learning and that it was a waste of effort to attempt to change them.
Then there suddenly arose a “Galilean” scholar who came to be ranked with the highest from his very first appearance and who later became known by his name, Rabbi Jose of Galilee. It occurred during a discussion regarding the rules governing the eating of the flesh of a first born animal that Rabbi Jose arose from among the disciples and proved that the two leaders of the academy—Rabbi Tarphon and Rabbi Akiba—were mistaken. One can readily imagine the surprise of all those gathered when they heard the Galilean present many proofs on behalf of his contention and they saw his firmness of conviction.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">זבחים נ״ז א׳.</span></i> When Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha heard the arguments of the Galilean he asked that Rabbi Akiba be told that he was in error and that the law was as the Galilean said.
Since that day Rabbi Jose remained among the scholars of Jabneh and he was accorded greater honors from day to day. Everybody respected him. His opinions generally conflicted with those of Rabbi Akiba and although he considered Rabbi Akiba to be his teacher he once remarked to him, “Were you to argue all day I would not accept your opinion.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">זבחים פּ״ב א׳.</span></i> Another time he interrupted Rabbi Akiba during a lecture and said to him: “How much longer will you speak of the Shechinah as one speaks of an everyday subject?”<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה י״ד א׳.</span></i>
Later it was said that Rabbi Jose of Galilee “gathers every crumb of Torah wherever he can, even from the least of the disciples, even as God chose Mount Sinai, which is the smallest of the mountains, from which to hand down the Torah to the Jews.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק י״ח.</span></i>
Regarding the scholarship of Rabbi Jose it may be said that he succeeded in discerning that which others failed to see. Gentle as he was in his conduct he nevertheless was severe to all those who tried to turn the Jews away from God and he said: “If someone tries to prove to you that his god is the right one, you must not believe him even if he was to stop the sun in the middle of the sky.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין צ׳ א׳.</span></i>
Some historians maintain that Rabbi Jose was well advanced in age when he came to Jabneh from Galilee and that he was already renowned at that time for his scholarship. They believe that, since Galilee was affected less than other sections of Palestine at the beginning of the revolt preceding the destruction, it probably became a place of refuge for the peace loving elements among the Jews who fled there to escape the vengeance of the rebels. Among the refugees was the wealthy Azariah, the father of Rabbi Elazar, who sent his son to study with Rabbi Jose.
Rabbi Jose was widely known for his piety and the belief was widespread that were a drought to occur and Rabbi Jose was to pray for rain, he would undoubtedly obtain from God whatever he requested. It was also characteristic of the man that he was unhappy in his domestic life. The wife of Rabbi Jose, who was also his niece, was a wicked woman. She frequently shamed him in the presence of his pupils and when they asked their master why he does not divorce her, he answered that he could not do so because he did not possess enough money to pay her enormous “Kethubah” (dower-rights).
Rabbi Jose once returned home from the academy accompanied by his pupil, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah. His wife paid no attention to him nor to his guest, and when he asked her whether she had any food prepared she replied angrily: “There is some boiled grass in the pot.” Rabbi Jose uncovered the pot and found in it the flesh of fatted hens. Together with his pupil he partook of the repast. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah then said to him: “She said that there was only boiled grass in the pot when it contained the flesh of hens. Why should she deceive you so?” Rabbi Jose replied, “Very probably a miracle occurred. She put grass into the pot, just as she told me, but the grass turned into the flesh of fattened hens.”
After the meal was finished Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah said, “Rabbi, send this woman away from your house. She does not know how to appreciate your worth.” But Rabbi Jose said, “She has a large ‘Kethubah’ and I have no money with which to pay it.” Rabbi Elazar answered, “We, your pupils, will provide the money to pay her ‘Kethubah’ and send her away.” Rabbi Jose then did as his pupils advised him.
The woman then married the night watchman of the city who, soon after, lost all his possessions and also became blind. He therefore had to give up his position as watchman and his wife had to lead him from house to house to beg for alms for their sustenance. But whenever she came to the street where Rabbi Jose lived, she passed it by. Her husband then asked her why she did not lead him through the street of Rabbi Jose the Galilean, for he had heard that Rabbi Jose was very charitable, and she replied: “I was divorced by him and I could not bear to go into his house to beg for alms.”
But one day the watchman and his wife made the rounds of the whole city and received no money. She then entered the street where Rabbi Jose lived but she skipped his house. When the blind man noticed this he began to beat her with his cane. Rabbi Jose heard her cries and when he found out their condition he lodged both of them in one of his houses and provided them with sustenance all the days of their life.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי כתובות פרק י״א הלכה ג׳, בראשית רבה פּרשה י״ז פּיסקא ג׳.</span></i>
Especially interesting are the commentaries of Rabbi Jose to the commandments of the Torah. Sometimes he sought to lighten the burden of the commandments while at other times he tried to make them even more severe. The law concerning a “disobedient son” (<span dir="rtl">בן סורר ומורה</span>) the other scholars interpreted in manner that would have made it impossible to condemn one such to death. Since a “disobedient son” could not be condemned unless he was also a “glutton” they declared that he could not be considered as such until he consumed a pound of meat, half boiled and half raw, at one gulp and at the same time drank half a quart of the best Italian wine at one sip. His gluttonous feast had to be made in the company of immoral youths and was to be bought with money stolen by the “disobedient son” from his father. In addition, they ruled that the “disobedient son” had to be at least thirteen years and one day of age but not much older than that, for then he could no longer be considered a “son” dependent on his father. The culprit must have had both a father and a mother who were required to be of the same opinion and appearance, for both had to lead him to court and had to present the same complaints against him.
But Rabbi Jose believed that the essence of the sin of a “disobedient son” was gluttony and he believed that such a culprit deserved the death punishment because of his possible future. Engaging in such gluttony, a “disobedient son” was sure to waste his father’s wealth and to turn to stealing in order to satisfy his habits. He therefore believed that the Torah preferred the death of such a person while still innocent rather than his execution after committing crimes.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ע״ב א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jose followed in the footsteps of Rabbi Akiba in the matter of expounding every saying of the Torah which might have seemed to be superfluous. Thus he explained the verse “but my Sabbaths you shall observe” (Ex. 31:13) to indicate that certain labors may be performed on the Sabbath such as work in the Temple or in order to save a human life. This interpretation he based on the word <span dir="rtl">״אך״</span> in the Hebrew text.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספתא שבת פרק ט״ז.</span></i>
In the case of many other commandments Rabbi Jose sought to lighten the burden of their observance. He ruled that no “Bikurim” (offering of first fruits) need be brought from the lands east of the Jordan because it was not characterized as a land of milk and honey.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בכורים פרק א׳ משנה י׳.</span></i> He established the rule that so long as a person is engaged in the observance of one commandment he is absolved from observing any other commandments at the same time.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוכה כ״ו א׳.</span></i> The verse, “Before an old man you shall rise,” (Lev. 19:32) he explained to mean that only a scholarly person is to be accorded that honor.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ל״ב ב׳.</span></i>
He also expressed opinions which did not become accepted. He declared, for instance, that the prohibition against deriving any benefit from leavened bread during the Passover is not effective on all the seven days of the holiday. Leavened bread, which was held over the Passover, he suggested, could certainly be used.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים כ״ג א׳, ל״ב א׳.</span></i> In Rabbi Jose’s native city people were in the habit of eating the meat of fowl with milk and Rabbi Jose attempted to justify this on the ground that birds do not yield milk and the prohibition, “you should not boil a kid in its mother’s milk,” therefore did not apply to fowl.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ק״ל א׳, חולין קי״ג א׳.</span></i>
Some Biblical descriptions of historical events, such as the exodus from Egypt and the giving of the Torah, Rabbi Jose raised to great poetic heights. Expounding the verse, “why do you skip on wrinkled hills,” (Psalms, 68:17) he said: “When God was ready to give the Torah from Mount Sinai, the other mountains skipped about in confusion. They argued among themselves and each one claimed the honor of having God give the Torah to the Jews from its top.”
In describing the rending of the sea before the Jews, Rabbi Jose said that when the Jews jumped into the sea even before the waters parted before them, Mount Moriah was torn out from its place and the altar upon which Isaac was to have been sacrificed hastened to the sea. Only when the image of Isaac lying bound on the altar and Abraham standing over him with his slaughtering knife could be seen did the sea part its waters, for only because of the merit of Abraham’s offering of Isaac was the sea rent for the Jews.
And when the Jews emerged on the other side of the sea and they began to chant songs of praise, even the children in their mothers’ arms turned their faces heavenward and sang and the babies left their mothers’ breast and also sang.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה ל׳ ב׳, מכילתא פּרשת בשלח.</span></i>
No mention is made of the death of Rabbi Jose of Galilee. It is possible that when the revolt of Bar Kochba was being prepared, he returned to Galilee and there he died.

Rabbi Akiba ben Joseph

T<small>HE HIGHEST PLACE OF HONOR</small> among all of our national heroes undoubtedly belongs to Rabbi Akiba ben Joseph. Like the lives of all historically outstanding personalities, Rabbi Akiba’s life history is also surrounded with legends which shed a saintly halo on his origin and personal development.
Rabbi Akiba’s father was a proselyte, or the son of a proselyte, and he traced his descent from Sisera, the commander of Jabin the king of Hazor. In his youth Rabbi Akiba was a shepherd in the service of the wealthy Kalba Savua.
Kalba Savua (sometimes referred to as Ben Kalba Savua) was one of the wealthiest men of Jerusalem before its destruction and he was renowned for his charities. During the war against the Romans he undertook to supply the inhabitants of Jerusalem with food for the duration of the siege of the city. There exist differing opinions regarding the meaning of the name. Some explain it to indicate that he was a descendant of Kaleb ben Jephuneh while others say that he obtained it because of his generosity—if a poor man came to his house hungry as a dog, he left it filled. But there is the much simpler explanation that the name Kalba Savua meant a “storeroom filled with grain.”
Rachel, the daughter of Kalba Savua, loved Akiba and promised to become his wife if he would agree to devote himself to learning. It is told that Akiba was at that time already a man close to forty years of age and he did not even know the Alphabet. He had a son by a previous wife who was also an uneducated man. The love of Kalba Savua’s daughter was variously interpreted. Some said that it was but the whim of a spoiled rich man’s daughter who became infatuated with a shepherd. Others reasoned that the shepherd must have possessed such noble traits as would captivate even so noble a lady as the daughter of Kalba Savua.
When Kalba Savua heard of this he disowned his daughter and vowed to disinherit her.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ס״ב ב׳.</span></i>
It is necessary to mention that when Rachel asked Akiba to devote himself to learning he at first doubted the wisdom of her request. At that time he felt a considerable disdain for scholars and also doubted his own capabilities of learning. But one day he happened to see how falling drops of water had, in time, hollowed out a stone and he said to himself: “If water, which is soft, could hollow out the hard stone, the words of the Torah, which are hard, will certainly make an impression on my soft heart.”
Together with his son he went to a teacher and began his studies. But after he finished studying the Torah, history makes no more mention of the development of his son and continues to relate of Rabbi Akiba alone. For many years he was a disciple of Nahum of Gimso, then he turned to Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus and Rabbi Joshua ben Chananiah to show him the ways of the oral law. Rabbi Eliezer paid not the slightest attention to him. He only allowed him to audit his expositions but otherwise he ignored him. Rabbi Joshua, on the other hand, treated him seriously, for he appreciated his great desire to learn.
For a long time Rabbi Akiba sat at the feet of Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua. In later life he told that he served them both and did whatever they commanded him to do and even kneaded the dough for their bread. From this we may conclude how difficult were Rabbi Akiba’s circumstances. He was a poor man and his father-in-law would not aid him in the least. He gained his livelihood by picking a bundle of wood every day, half of which he sold while from the other half he would make faggots to light the house while studying. His neighbors then complained that the smoke from the faggots inconvenienced them at night and they advised him to sell all the wood and to buy oil instead.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק ו׳.</span></i>
When, despite his work, there still was not enough food in the house, his wife Rachel cut off her beautiful braids and sold them to aid her husband and to enable him to devote more time to the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שבת פרק ו׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
For thirteen years Rabbi Akiba studied with Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus and the latter never deigned to ask an opinion of him until one day Rabbi Akiba began to ask questions of his master and he could find no answer to them. Rabbi Joshua then addressed Rabbi Eliezer with the following verse, “Is not this the people that you have disdained? Go and contend with them,” by which he meant to say that here was one whom Rabbi Eliezer constantly ignored and now he posed questions which could not be answered.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי פּסחים פרק ו׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
Another description of those events relates that after an absence of twelve years Rabbi Akiba returned to his native city accompanied by twelve thousand disciples. Listening to what was going on within his house he heard his wife arguing with a neighbor who asked her, “How much longer will you lead the life of a widow,” and she replied that if she were sure that her husband was devoting himself to learning she would gladly wait another twelve years.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ס״ב ב׳.</span></i> Upon hearing this Rabbi Akiba returned to his studies for another twelve years and then he came accompanied by twenty-four thousand disciples.
One can easily imagine what the poor woman felt when she saw her husband surrounded by so many thousands of disciples. As she made her way through the throngs and fell at his feet Rabbi Akiba’s disciples wanted to push her away, but he said to them: “Leave her be, that which I possess today and from which you can benefit I acquired only through her.”
When Kalba Savua heard that one of the outstanding Jewish scholars arrived, he came to him that he may absolve him of his vow regarding his daughter. At that time Kalba Savua repented having allowed his daughter to suffer hunger for twenty-four years. Rabbi Akiba made himself known to his father-in-law and they were reconciled and Kalba Savua gave him half of his wealth.
The Talmud relates that Rabbi Akiba then possessed golden and silver tables in his house and that he ascended his bed on golden stairs. As a reward for his wife who cut off and sold her hair to help him, he bought for her the most expensive adornments, one which was an image of Jerusalem engraved in gold which she wore on her head in place of the hair which she had cut off. But such ornaments were not allowed, at that time, to be worn by married women because of the mourning for the destroyed Temple, and the wife of Rabban Gamliel the Nasi envied the wife of Rabbi Akiba and told her husband. But Rabban Gamliel said to her, “If you had done for your husband what she did for hers I would buy you an ornament just like it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שבת פרק ו׳ הלכה א׳, סוטה פרק ט׳ הלכה ט״ו.</span></i>
As might have been expected, Rabbi Eliezer was dissatisfied with the appearance of a new star on the firmament of Jewish learning, for it was obvious that he would tread new paths. Rabbi Eliezer clung strictly and without questioning to the traditional interpretations of the Torah. Rabbi Akiba, on the other hand, evolved a new method. He believed that the oral law was not a predetermined matter without spirit and incapable of further development. Not adduced from the text and the letters of the Torah.
The Torah as we have it, Rabbi Akiba said, is complete and there is nothing lacking or superfluous in it. In its entirety it is all content without embellishment; it contains no artistic descriptions and no useless words. Every letter and every dot possesses some special significance.
Wherever there occurs a repetition of a word it probably serves to indicate a special meaning. Even the connecting words and articles such as “if,” “the,” “but” and “also” are subject to interpretation. When it seems to one that there is a superfluous word in the Torah it is only because the person cannot grasp its meaning with his limited intelligence. Even the word <span dir="rtl">לאמר״</span>„ which frequently occurs in the Bible has its significance and could be expounded. The article <span dir="rtl">את״</span>„ in the verse “you shall fear the Lord your God (<span dir="rtl">את ה׳ אלהיך תירא</span>) he explained to indicate that man must fear both God and his Torah. Another time he modified his explanation to mean that man must fear God and the scholars.
Until that time the scholars only considered the content of the law and not its form. The oral law was not classified according to content and it was necessary to study much and to possess a tremendous memory in order to retain the rulings of all the scholars. Rabbi Akiba began to classify each law according to its content and he laid the foundation for the compilation of the Mishna which was finally written down and edited many years later.
Regarding the significance of the interpretations of Rabbi Akiba to the Torah there exists a legend<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מנחות כ״ט ב׳.</span></i> which relates that when Moses ascended heaven to receive the Torah he saw God attaching little crowns to the letters of the Torah. Moses thereupon said to God: “Lord of the world! What prevents you from giving the Torah without these crowns?” and God answered him: “Some day after many generations there will arise a man Akiba ben Joseph who will derive heaps of laws from every little dash and it is for his sake that I prepare these little crowns.” Moses then said, “Will you show him to me? I would gladly look upon him.” God commanded Moses to look among the scholars sitting on the eighth bench and he saw there a man and he heard him expound to his disciples but he did not understand a word of what was being said although he heard the man conclude, “This I received as law to Moses from Mount Sinai.”
Then Moses said, “Lord of the world! You have such a great man and You give the Torah through me?” and God replied, “It is My will.” Moses thereupon said, “You have shown me the man, now reveal to me his end,” and God answered, “Turn backwards and you will see.” Moses looked and saw the body of Rabbi Akiba being torn to pieces.
A similar legend is also related in the Talmud that God revealed to Adam the record of all coming generations which will descend from him together with their scholars and their leaders and He also showed him the generation of Rabbi Akiba. Adam greatly enjoyed his learning but was saddened at sight of the death which awaited Rabbi Akiba. He attempted to obtain an easier death for him, but his request was denied.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה ח׳ א׳, סנהדרין ל״ח ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Akiba headed an academy in Bnei Brak which was located south-east of Jaffa. He frequently came to the sessions of the Sanhedrin in Jabneh and no important law was ever adopted without his participation. Once he arrived late at the academy and remained sitting outside. It was then said that “the Torah is outside” and no decisions were adopted until he came in.
Attempting to describe the work of Rabbi Akiba, the scholars said that he was like a man who goes through the streets with a basket in his hand and picks up whatever he can find. If he finds wheat he puts it in his basket; if he finds barley he picks it up; the same with beans and lentils. Rabbi Akiba did likewise when he sought to introduce order into the laws.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק י״ח.</span></i>
It is claimed that Rabbi Akiba was versed in the various sciences, such as medicine and astronomy. He also spoke several languages and on several occasions he accompanied Rabban Gamliel on the latter’s trips to Rome in the cause of the Jewish people. When Rufus (or Tyranos Rufus as he is called in the Talmud) was governor of Palestine, he frequently debated with Rabbi Akiba many matters pertaining to the Jewish faith and the Torah. And when the Roman government began to suppress the observance of the Torah Rabbi Akiba could easily counteract these decrees.
One of the brightest phases of the life of Rabbi Akiba, perhaps the outstanding event, was his participation in the revolt of Bar Kochba. Some historians claim that Rabbi Akiba was one of the leaders of the revolt, but this is probably an exaggeration just as the statements of others that Rabbi Akiba merely preached about Bar Kochba but took no active part in the revolt.
Rabbi Akiba was already too old to take his place in the foremost ranks of the revolution. But his twenty-four thousand disciples, which according to legend died between the Passover and Lag B’Omer, probably joined the forces of Bar Kochba. The trip of Rabbi Akiba throughout the cities of Palestine and also to those beyond the frontier in order to establish which year is to be “Ibur” (a year containing thirteen months which occurs thrice every eight years according to the lunar calendar) was probably undertaken as a journey of agitation for the cause of the revolution. The same may be said with a large degree of certainty regarding the “Seder” in Bnei Brak where the most prominent Jewish leaders were assembled in Rabbi Akiba’s house.
It is regrettable that the records of this revolt are so meager. In the description of the destruction of the Temple are included some events of the destruction of Betar and it is very difficult to separate them. Conclusive descriptions of Bar Kochba’s activities are found only in the Jerusalem Talmud<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית פרק ד׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i> and in Midrash Eicha Rabathi. But these are also complicated and mixed with terrifying legends. In addition there exists a description of Bar Kochba’s revolutionary wars in the writings of the Roman historian Dio Cassius who described the Jewish hero in a horrifying form. It thus becomes necessary to glean the events from various other occurrences of that time and still more is left for the imagination.
When Rabbi Akiba saw Bar Kochba in all his glory he is said to have exclaimed, “This is the king the Messiah.” He invoked the verse from the prophet (Haggai, 2:21) which foretold that God would cause the heaven and the earth and the sea and the dry land to quake and that He would destroy the thrones of the Gentile kingdoms; their strength would be made to naught and their chariots and horses would be overthrown so that one would be slain by the sword of the other. Rabbi Akiba thus exerted a profound influence on the people. Hosts of people arrived daily to pledge their allegiance to Bar Kochba, for they all believed the words of Rabbi Akiba that Bar Kochba was the long awaited Messiah and that he would bring about the redemption of his people.
Because of his belief in Bar Kochba, Rabbi Akiba allowed himself to be insulted by an obscure colleague, Rabbi Jochanan ben Toratha, who said to him: “Akiba, grass will grow out of your cheek bones and the Messiah will still not have arrived.”
In explanation of the cause of Bar Kochba’s immediate popularity, Talmudic sources relate that when the Roman soldiers hurled stones at the walls of the Jewish cities with their machines, Bar Kochba ascended the walls and, catching the stones between his knees, he hurled them back at the enemy killing a few of them with each stone. Dio Cassius, on the other hand, relates that Bar Kochba would light a flaxen faggot and keep it in his mouth to convince his followers that he was a fire eater.
Today we definitely know that the political situation of that time was intolerable. The Temple was destroyed and the Jewish state was no longer in existence for sixty years. Only a handful of the older generation who remembered the temple still survived, but its memory lived in the heart of the people and everyone dreamed of its restoration. The temple hill was transformed into a Roman soldiers’ camp and the Jews were in a worse position than slaves in their own country. The Roman governor of Palestine was the murderous despot whom the Jews named Tyranos Rufus and he persecuted them relentlessly and ridiculed their suffering. As the conditions became unbearable, the Jews thought constantly of liberation and whenever they gathered they would ask each other: “Will the Roman legions always keep their foot upon the neck of Judea? How much longer will the Roman eagle sink its claws into the living body of the Jewish people?”
Bar Kochba then undertook to organize a Jewish army of hundreds of thousands of men with the consent of Rabbi Akiba and he succeeded in maintaining his revolt for three and a half years. Talmudic sources estimate the number of Bar Kochba’s soldiers at 400,000. Dio Cassius relates that the number was 580,000 or nearly two hundred thousand more than the Talmudic figure. People streamed from all sides and even the Samaritans, the traditional enemies of the Jews, forgot their hatred and joined the Jews in the struggle against Rome. Numerous neighboring people also joined the uprising in the hope that the liberation of Judea would also bring freedom from the Roman yoke for them.
Wishing to test the bravery of his soldiers, Bar Kochba commanded each of them to cut off, or, with his own teeth, to bite off one of their fingers. But the scholars sent the following message to Bar Kochba, “Why do you cause your people to cripple themselves?” Bar Kochba replied by asking, “What other method shall I use to test their bravery?” and he was advised to command that each soldier must uproot a cedar of Lebanon with his bare hands while riding on a horse. Bar Kochba subsequently had 220,000 soldiers with cut off fingers and another 200,000 who uprooted trees bare handed while riding by on a horse.
Sometime after this experiment Bar Kochba is said to have addressed the following words to God: “Since You have forsaken us and no longer go with us in our wars, we ask of You that You should not intervene. We do not require Your aid but only ask that You should not aid our enemies.”
It was already remarked above that the descriptions of that war are very meager and at times contradictory. Nearly all the scholars of that time, with the exception of Rabbi Akiba, did not support the revolution and when it ended in failure they condemned Bar Kochba, and of the saying of Rabbi Akiba concerning Bar Kochba that “a star has arisen from Jacob,” they declared that he should not have used the word <span dir="rtl">כוכב״</span>„ (a star) but rather the word <span dir="rtl">כוזב״</span>„ (a deceiver).
The revolt was prepared during the famous “Seder” night which is mentioned in the Hagada. Several Tanaim met in the home of Rabbi Akiba in Bnei Brak, where he headed a large academy with many thousands of students, to discuss the miracles of the departure from Egypt because it was necessary to come to a final decision regarding the burning question of that day—the impatience of the younger Jewish generation and their spirit of rebellion against Roman tyranny.
The Roman authorities knew the mood of the people and attempted to suppress it. Informers mingled with the Jewish young men and every suspicious remark was reported to the Romans. They therefore feared to discuss openly the problem of Roman oppression and they spent the whole night discussing the “exodus from Egypt” and the great number of plagues which were visited on Pharaoh, to the number of 250, for they considered ten plagues insufficient in view of the suffering of the Jews. They also sought to console themselves with the hope that God would punish the enemies of his people as they deserved.
This “debate” lasted all night while crowds of impatient people stood outside and waited for the decision of the scholars. In the light of the Passover moon, this group of men who came to celebrate the “Seder” in the home of Rabbi Akiba and told each other of the wondrous valor of Bar Kochba, seemed strange indeed. But the hours meanwhile passed. As the moon paled and the horizon became suffused with crimson, the pupils of Rabbi Akiba began to look into the house where the scholars sat and still debated the “departure from Egypt.” The people realized the danger of the situation, for Roman soldiers might arrive at any moment and inquire the reason why the “Seder” lasts so long. Their patience finally exhausted, they opened the doors and shouted, “Our teachers, the time for the morning ‘Shema’ has arrived,” hinting that it was time to end the debate.
This exclamation put an end to the discussion. The impatience of the younger men triumphed over the weariness of the old. A ray of light penetrated the house and the scholars together with their disciples began to chant the old hymn of revenge, “Pour out Thy wrath upon the nations that have not known You.”
The echo of the chant resounded from the hills of Judea. Like one man the people arose from Gilead to Bashan to cast off the yoke of the Romans. Young men armed themselves and the blacksmiths forged swords out of scythes.
The Roman legions which were stationed in Palestine were too weak to withstand the army of Bar Kochba and the governor Rufus was forced to withdraw from the fortresses. Dio Cassius relates that the Jews immediately occupied fifty fortified cities and 985 open towns and villages. The Romans then withdrew from Judea, Samaria and Galilee and the Jews took over the government.
When the first reports of the revolt were brought to Hadrian, he ridiculed them; but when other messengers arrived one after another reporting the defeat of the Roman legions and the danger that the revolt may spread to other provinces of the Roman empire in Asia, Hadrian became concerned and dispatched still other legions. But the reinforcements could achieve nothing.
The victories of the Jews inspired within them the belief that they have regained their national freedom. Many Jews, who previously denied their origin and adopted heathen faiths to escape persecution, returned to the religion of their forefathers. Bar Kochba also wanted to immortalize the event of Judea’s liberation and he had coins minted in honor of the victory with the Hebrew inscription (in Samaritan alphabet) “to the liberty of Israel” (<span dir="rtl">לחירות ישראל״</span>„).
It is not known whether Bar Kochba occupied Jerusalem or whether he planned to restore the temple. There are grounds to believe that he was willing to forego Jerusalem and that he planned to move the boundaries of the land of Israel toward Galilee because of the condescending attitude and the ridicule with which the inhabitants of Jerusalem treated the people of Galilee. It is even told that the people of Betar celebrated with lighted torches the day that Jerusalem was destroyed.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי תענית פרק ד׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>
With deep concern Hadrian heard of the spread of the revolt and all the forces which he sent against it met with failure. The Jews were victorious in over fifty encounters with the Romans and the commanders whom Hadrian sent had to return to Rome defeated and shamed.
Hadrian then recalled his greatest military commander, Julius Severus, who was then engaged in war in the British isles and placed him in command of the war in Palestine. Despite the bravery of Severus and the number of his troops which outnumbered the Jews two or three to one, he did not venture to meet the Jews in open conflict after the experience of his predecessors, and he waited for an opportunity to employ his strategy of small attacks. This type of warfare wearied the Jewish soldiers. The Samaritans, who fought alongside of the Jews at first, betrayed their allies. Severus persisted in attacking the Jewish forces on several sides at one time in order to force them to concentrate their armies in one place where he could finally engage them in a decisive struggle.
This strategy forced the Jews to concentrate in the fortress of Betar which Severus then besieged. The inhabitants of Tiberias and Sephoris also deserted the cause of Bar Kochba and joined the Romans. An unusual drought affected the land and deprived the people of water. But all of these circumstances proved of no avail until Severus bribed the treasonable Samaritans. Bar Kochba was wary of the Samaritans and probably guessed that their loyalty was doubtful. But since the Samaritans could enter and leave the fortress freely they had an opportunity to show the Romans the secret entrances and their treason succeeded.
The immediate cause of the fall of Betar is given by the Talmud as the blow which Bar Kochba delivered to Rabbi Eliezer of Modiin and which resulted in his instantaneous death. Throughout the siege of Betar, Rabbi Eliezer of Modiin shielded the city with his piety and everyone was convinced that the fortress would not fall as long as he lived. As Rabbi Eliezer was standing deeply immersed in prayer, a Samaritan came up and whispered to him something which he could not hear. This was related to Bar Kochba who questioned the Samaritan as to the secret which he whispered to Rabbi Eliezer. The Samaritan replied: “If I will not tell you what I said to Rabbi Eliezer, you will kill me; if I do, Emperor Hadrian will have me executed.” Bar Kochba guessed that Rabbi Eliezer was negotiating peace with the Romans and he therefore delivered the blow which caused his death. But this resulted in a moral defeat for Bar Kochba. The people within the fortress lost their war spirit and the Samaritans found it a relatively easy task to bring in the Romans.
The horror of the Roman occupation of Betar is described in the story that their horses waded in blood and that the river which flows around Betar was two-thirds full of blood. The blood of the victims flowed in a mighty stream to the Meditaranean Sea and in its onrush it swept tremendous obstacles.
Severus was anxious to capture Bar Kochba alive in order to lead him in his triumphal entry into Rome just as Titus did to the heroes of Jerusalem after the destruction of the temple. When he failed in this he promised a great reward to the one who would bring to him the body of Bar Kochba. A Samaritan brought Bar Kochba’s head and claimed that he had killed him. But Severus commanded him to bring the body of Bar Kochba, for he did not believe that the Samaritan could have killed the Jewish hero. When the body of Bar Kochba was discovered, a snake was found coiled around it and Severus declared: “I knew that only God could kill such a man, for no man could avail against him.”
After the destruction of Betar Hadrian undertook to annihilate the whole Jewish people and wherever one was met he was put to death. If the person captured was of some importance he was tortured first and the tortures increased in brutality in proportion to the importance of the captive. Rabbi Akiba was one of the first victims. While still alive, his body was cut with iron combs. When the angels in heaven saw this they wept bitterly and their tears fell into the great sea and caused it to boil and the whole world was shaken by their voices as they asked God: “Is this Your reward to a man who observed Your Torah?”
When Rabbi Akiba only began his career the aged Rabbi Dosa ben Horkinas said of him that “his name resounds from one end of the world to the other.” Rabbi Tarphon similarly said to him, “Whoever departs from you is like one who departs from life.” When Rabbi Akiba was dead, all the scholars agreed that “the arms of the Torah were severed and the springs of wisdom were sealed.”
Rabbi Akiba often said, “Whatever God does, man must believe that it will end well. Whatever happens has been foreseen from above, but man nevertheless possesses a free will to control his actions. The world should be judged according to its virtues and whatever one receives in this world is but a small share of the reward which is to come. If one sees a wicked man who is happy, he must be sure that his end will be evil.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק ג׳ משנה ט״ו, אבות דר׳ נתן פרק ל״ט.</span></i>
If people are satisfied with a person, Rabbi Akiba said, it must be taken as a sign that God is also pleased with him, and if a person displeases his fellow men, it is a sign that he also displeases God. If one is satisfied with his possessions, it is a good sign for him, but if one is displeased with his possessions, it is a bad omen.
Rabbi Akiba laid down seven rules of conduct which he taught his son. 1) Do not reside on the busiest street of the city if you wish to study undisturbed. 2) Do not reside in a city whose rulers are scholars, for they will be busy with their studies and will not devote themselves to the needs of the city. 3) Do not enter your house, and especially your friend’s house, suddenly, for its occupants may be engaged in some action which you should not see. 4) Do not go about barefoot in the streets, for it is unseemly. 5) It is better to rise and to dine early during the summer on account of the heat and during the winter because of the cold. 6) It is better to set your Sabbath table as poorly as on a week day rather than to ask for human aid. 7) Always endeavor to gain the friendship of men who are successful in their enterprises.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים קי״ב א׳.</span></i>
Although Rabbi Akiba instructed his son not to go about barefoot, it happened that on one of his trips to Rome to interceed for the Jews he walked about the city without boots. He was met by one of the emperor’s eunuchs who said to him, “You are a teacher among the Jews and I will tell you three things: If a man rides on a horse he is a king; if he rides on an ass, he is a free citizen; if he wears boots, he is an ordinary man. But one who possesses none of these would be better off dead.” To this Rabbi Akiba replied. “Three things you have told me and I will say three things to you: the ornament on a man’s face is a beard; the joy of a man’s heart is a wife, and the gift of God are children. Woe to the man who possesses none of these.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מדרש קהלת רבה פּרשה י׳ פּיסקא ט׳.</span></i>
During all of his lectures Rabbi Akiba moralized his listeners in an inspiring fashion and the maxims which he expressed were repeated in every Jewish home and every man tried to regulate his life according to Rabbi Akiba’s moral precepts. In one such lecture he formulated six rules for his audience: 1) Do not associate with the scornful that you may not copy their deeds. 2) Do not partake of food with an ignorant priest lest he give of the tithes to eat and you will be guilty of benefiting from the “holies.” 3) Do not indulge in too many vows, for you may not be able to fulfill them and you will be guilty of breaking your oath. 4) Refrain from eating at all feasts, for some day you may have to depend on charity. 5) Refrain from actions the sinfulness of which you doubt and you will be preserved from certain sin. 6) Avoid leaving the Land of Israel, for it may lead you to idolatry.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק כ״ו.</span></i>
On another occasion Rabbi Akiba said: “For their three good habits I love the Medians: 1) When they cut meat, they do so on a table. 2) When they kiss each other, they kiss the hand. 3) When they have to confer with each other, they go out into the fields.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ח׳ ב׳.</span></i>
The Talmud relates that when Rabbi Akiba was imprisoned<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים קי״ב א׳.</span></i> Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai came to visit him and said to him, “Rabbi, teach me.” But Rabbi Akiba refused and Rabbi Simeon said, “If you will not teach me I will tell this to my father Yochai and he will report you to the government.”<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">It would seem that Yochai, the father of Rabbi Simeon, was an official of the Roman government and that it was his duty to prevent the Jews from studying the Torah. Those who engaged in such study were sentenced to death. But the political role of Yochai is not entirely clear. The entire conversation between Rabbi Simeon and Rabbi Akiba is illogical. Since Rabbi Akiba was already imprisoned for teaching the Torah, it was no longer necessary to report him to the authorities, and since he refused to teach Rabbi Simeon, there was nothing to report.</i>) Rabbi Akiba replied, “Much as the calf is willing to feed, the cow is even more anxious to feed it,” and Rabbi Simeon responded, “If feeding is dangerous, the calf is in greater peril.”
Rabbi Akiba then told him the following five rules of life: 1) If you wish to hang yourself, you must do so on a high tree (meaning that if one wishes to quote someone he should quote the words of a great man). 2) When you teach your son, teach him from a correct book that he should not become accustomed to errors. 3) Do not use a pot which others have used before you (meaning that one should not marry a woman who was possessed by another man). 4) Observing a commandment, when one is certain of it, is like lending money on a field which bears fruit. 5) Observing a commandment with a clean body is like marrying a woman and begetting children.
Whoever takes even a cent from charity when he does not need it—Rabbi Akiba said—will certainly need charity before he dies. Whoever wraps his eyes or arms and legs with rags in order to deceive people and to beg for alms will certainly become a cripple. One who throws bread upon the ground or scatters his money in his anger will be forced to depend on charity before he dies. He who tears his clothes or breaks a dish in his anger should be considered like one who worships idols.<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק ג׳.</span></i>
Loaning money for interest was always considered by the scholars to be a great sin. In defining interest Rabbi Akiba said that even an extra greeting may be considered as such, as, for example, when a person who never greeted another begins to greet him after he borrowed money from him. Such a greeting is equivalent to interest.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספתא בבא מציעא פרק ו׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Akiba believed that the Jewish people proved the greatness of God. When he redeemed them from captivity, He did so for His own benefit, for He redeemed Himself together with them. Wherever the Jews are in exile the “Shechinah” is with them, and when they leaxe exile it is as if God had been redeemed as well. God also obtained a “bargain” in choosing the Jews as his people because other peoples praise their gods when they prosper and curse them when their fortunes change; but the Jews praise God always, when they prosper and also when they are in difficulties.
He also compared the Jewish people to a bird; just as a bird depends on its wings to carry it, so also do Jews follow the teachings of their elders. He believed that even the poorest Jew could consider himself an aristocrat because of his descent from Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ויקרא רבה פּרשה י״א פּיסקא ח׳, בבא קמא צ׳ ב׳.</span></i>
The highest phase of Jewish life is the Torah. This gift of God to the Jews deserves that people should sacrifice their lives for it. When Hadrian issued a severe edict imposing the death penalty on any one who devoted himself to its study, Rabbi Akiba gathered his disciples wherever he could to continue their studies. The people then asked him: “Are you not afraid of the government?” and he answered them with a fable:
A fox went near a river and saw the fish scurrying around in great fear. The fox said to them, “What do you fear and from whom are you fleeing?” and the fish replied, “We flee the nets which men have spread for us.” The fox then said, “It would be better if you came out on dry land and we would live together just as my forefathers once lived together with your forefathers.” But the fish answered, “Are you he who is reputed to be the wisest of the animals? You are not the wisest but the most foolish. If we are afraid of being caught here, in the water, which is the place of our life, how much more should we be afraid on the dry land where we would die?”
Rabbi Akiba finished his fable by saying: “The same is true of our learning. If we are in danger of being caught when we are engaged in the study of the holy Torah, how much greater would the danger be if we should cease to devote ourselves to it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ס״א ב׳.</span></i>
Terrible as the conditions were at that time, Rabbi Akiba did not give up hoping that the Jewish kingdom would be restored. This hope was so great that despite the might of Rome and the ruin of Jerusalem, when Tyranos Rufus ordered the site of the Temple to be plowed up at the command of Hadrian, he still believed in the happy future of his people. When other scholars mourned the destruction, Rabbi Akiba smiled, for in his imagination he visualized the future splendor of Israel’s land of which he was convinced.
We already related that the Roman governor, Tyranos Rufus, frequently debated with Rabbi Akiba questions of faith. Being informed about the Jewish scriptures, he loved to debate those matters which seemed contradictory to him. He thus once asked Rabbi Akiba, “If your God loves the poor, why does he not feed them?” Rabbi Akiba answered: “He does so to provide us an opportunity to show charity and to stave ourselves from Gehenna.” “On the contrary, believe that He condemns you to Gehenna,” Rufus replied. “Take as an example a king who is angered by his slave and has him put into prison and he commands that none of the servants should give the slave anything to eat or drink. If the king should hear that the slave was fed, would he not be displeased?”
But Rabbi Akiba replied: “Let us consider this example in a somewhat different version. A king was angry with his son and he had him put in prison and he commanded that none should give food or drink to his son. Then there came a servant and offered the prince food and drink. Would not the king give beautiful gifts to the servant, when he heard of his dead?”<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא י׳ א׳.</span></i>
The verse “you shall drink water from your well” Rabbi Akiba explained to mean that the development of learning is based on a simple understanding of what one hears from others. Just as one can draw water from any side of the well without diminishing the water in the well, so also do students come to their teacher but they do not diminish their teacher’s knowledge any more than one who inhales the fragrance of an “ethrog” or one who lights his candle by the flame of another candle. But a scholar must remember that if he had disciples in his youth, he must also have disciples in his old age for one can never know which disciples will cling to their studies and which will abandon it.
The worth of a scholar may also be likened to a golden vessel. When a golden vessel breaks it can be mended and made whole again; when a scholar forgets his learning he can win it back again.<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קהלת רבה פּרשה ח׳ פּיסקא ז׳.</span></i> But a man must never be proud of his learning and one who prides himself on his knowledge of the Torah may be likened to a carcass which lies on the road and every passerby holds his nose to avoid the smell.<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק י״א.</span></i>
Much was spoken of Rabbi Akiba’s modesty which could serve as a model for all generations. When his son died Rabbi Akiba said the following words over his grave: “Jews have gathered here not because of my learning for greater scholars than myself have come; they also did not come because of my riches for there are present men richer than myself. The men of the South know me and they have come to the funeral, but the men of Galilee, how should they know me? There exist many Akibas like myself but they all came in honor of the Torah and to fulfill a commandment. This realization would console me were my sorrow sevenfold as great.”<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״א ב׳.</span></i>
Of all the books of the Bible Rabbi Akiba loved the Song of Songs most and he said that “the whole world is worth less than the day on which the Song of Songs was given to the Jews,”<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מסכת ידים פרק ג׳ משנה ה׳.</span></i> and “If God had not given the Torah, the Jewish people could conduct their spiritual world with the aid of the Song of Songs.” Rabbi Akiba was one of the first who visualized in the Song of Songs a description of the love of God for the Congregation of Israel. Among the people who lose their share in the life to come he listed those who attempt to transform the Song of Songs into an everyday tavern song.<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספתא סנהדרין פרק י״ב.</span></i>
Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus once arose during a fast day to pray for rain. He recited 24 benedictions and still no rain descended. Rabbi Akiba then approached the pulpit and exclaimed: “Our father, our king, we have no other ruler but you. Our father, our king, do for your own sake and have mercy upon us.” Immediately rain began to fall. Those assembled were disappointed that God answered the prayer of the pupil instead of the prayer of the teacher, but Rabbi Akiba calmed them with a fable: “There was once a king who had two daughters, one of which was a quiet person while the other was loud in her demands. The king commanded his servants that when the insistent daughter will ask for anything her demands should be granted at once. But the quiet daughter never received what she wanted for she asked for it humbly and the king also loved to hear her suppliant voice.”
Rabbi Akiba was condemned to death immediately after the fall of Betar. At that time he had already been imprisoned for some time either as a hostage or he was captured during a raid on one of the gatherings where it was only necessary to say that the Jews should not obey the Roman decrees regarding the Jewish faith, or that one should sacrifice his life for his beliefs, in order to be arrested.
When Rabbi Akiba was in prison there arose a number of important problems which could not be decided before hearing his opinion. Since no one was allowed to visit Rabbi Akiba, the Talmud relates that the scholars once sent Rabbi Jochanan ha-Sandlar, a disciple of Rabbi Akiba, dressed up as a peddler with a bundle of merchandise on his back. Rabbi Jochanan walked by the prison where Rabbi Akiba was held and he called out: “Needles, who’ll buy needles? Hooks, who’ll buy hooks? And what is the law regarding a <span dir="rtl">חליצה</span> who has no witnesses?” Rabbi Akiba stuck his head out betwen the bars of his cell and called out, “Do you have any spindles? Yes, it is legal.”<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי יבמות פרק ט׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>
The reasons for this question dated back to the case of a man in prison who granted Halitza to the wife of his deceased brother not in the presence of a court and without witnesses for none were allowed into his cell and the people who accompanied the woman had to remain outside the prison and could not see what went on within.
On another occasion the decision of Rabbi Akiba was required in a case of (a woman who refuses to live with her husband to whom she was married before she reached maturity). It was then necessary to hire a person for forty dinars who should steal into the prison to ask Rabbi Akiba’s opinion.<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ק״ח ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Akiba was imprisoned for a long time and during his incarceration he determined three consecutive leap years. This may indicate that he declared three successive years as leap years or—as is the opinion of some commentators—that he determined the three following leap years which were to be approved by the court although it was forbidden at that time to establish leap years in advance.<sup class="footnote-marker">30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין י״ב א׳, תוספתא סנהדרין פרק ב׳.</span></i>
Although Rabbi Akiba was closely guarded while in prison, he was sometimes allowed some liberties. He was probably closely watched that he should not continue to teach his disciples but he was allowed to have one person to serve him and that person was Rabbi Joshua Hagarsi, who stayed with him till the last minute.
It is told that Rabbi Joshua Hagarsi always brought water to Rabbi Akiba for his daily use. But one time the prison overseer met him while he was carrying the water and he was displeased, for it seemed to him that too much water was being brought for the use of one person. He thereupon remarked, “Why do you bring so much water to your teacher? Are you trying to undermine the prison?” and saying this he poured out half of the water.
Rabbi Akiba feared that if he would drink some of it there would not be enough water left with which to wash his hands and he would thus disobey the commandment to wash one’s hands, he therefore decided to suffer thirst rather than forego the commandment of washing one’s hands before a meal. The scholars afterward commented on this and said that if he was so observant while in prison one could easily imagine his conduct when he was at liberty.<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין כ״א ב׳.</span></i>
Finally the day of Rabbi Akiba’s trial by Tyranos Rufus came. This was a day of terror for all the Jews. Rabbi Joshua Hagarsi prayed to God for Rabbi Akiba until the minute that the sentence was passed and as he stood immersed in prayer a cloud overcast the sky. Rabbi Joshua remembered the verse of the Lamentations (3:44) and he addressed the following words to God: “You have covered yourself with a cloud that my prayer should not reach You and that You should not hear my appeal.”<sup class="footnote-marker">32)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מדרש איכה רבתי פּרשה ג׳ פּיסקא ל״ה.</span></i>
After a terrible judgment Tyranos Rufus condemned Rabbi Akiba to the most horrifying death. Ordinarily the Romans condemned their victims to be crucified; the prisoner would then be nailed to a wooden cross where he would hang until he died. Rabbi Akiba was condemned to be flayed alive with iron combs.
As Rabbi Akiba was being led to execution it was morning and time for reciting the “Shema.” Even as his flesh was being tom he did not allow this to interfere with his reciting the “Shema.” The execution was public and was witnessed by the whole population. When Rabbi Akiba’s disciples saw the suffering of their teacher they said: “Maybe it is enough?”, implying that perhaps it was time to pay more attention to the suffering of the body instead of the suffering of the soul. But he replied to them: “All the days of my life I have regretted that I had no opportunity to show my love for God in the manner which the Bible commands, that one must love God with his whole soul, even if He were to take that soul away. Now that I have an opportunity to fulfill this commandment shall I not do so?” And in reciting the “Shema” he prolonged the word <span dir="rtl">אחד״</span>„ until he expired.<sup class="footnote-marker">33)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ס״א ב׳.</span></i>
The Jerusalem Talmud<sup class="footnote-marker">34)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ט׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i> relates the events at the execution in a slightly different manner. It tells that Tyranos Rufus was personally present at the execution and when he saw Rabbi Akiba recite the “Shema” with a smile upon his lips he said to him: “Are you a sorcerer that you laugh at your suffering or are you doing so to hurt me?” Rabbi Akiba answered: “May you die. I am not a sorcerer nor am I insensible to my suffering, nor is it my wish to pain you with my smile. But we were commanded to love our God with our whole hearts, our whole souls and all our possessions. Until this day I have shown my love for God with my heart and my possessions. But this day I have an opportunity to show my love of God with my soul. I am therefore happy that I have attained this moment.”
But the Roman governor was not satisfied that the above described execution would permanently insure the death of Rabbi Akiba and he commanded that the dead body be cut into pieces.<sup class="footnote-marker">35)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מנחות כ״ט ב׳.</span></i>
Another legend describes the death of Rabbi Akiba in an idyllic manner. It relates that on the eve of a holiday Rabbi Joshua Hagarsi, who was always with Rabbi Akiba, went to his home for the holiday. But before he reached his house he found the prophet Elijah waiting at his door and he announced to him the news that Rabbi Akiba died in prison. They immediately hastened to the prison and they found the door of Rabbi Akiba’s cell wide open. They placed the body of Rabbi Akiba on the couch and they departed. That night they returned and took the body which they carried to Caesarea and there they buried it in a cave.
There exists an interesting legend regarding the relationship between Rabbi Akiba and the wife of Tyranos Rufus. It relates that Tyranos Rufus was always dejected after his arguments with Rabbi Akiba, for the latter always triumphed over him in the presence of the emperor. After one such debate the wife of Tyranos Rufus said to him: “Why are you so dejected?” and he replied, “This Rabbi Akiba always confuses me with his discourses and I can never conquer him.” The woman then said, “The God of the Jews hates immorality. If you will allow me, I will cause Rabbi Akiba to sin and he will lose his militant spirit.” “Do as you understand,” Tyranos Rufus said to her.
The woman then adorned herself and came to Rabbi Akiba. She tried with all her wiles to cause him to sin. But when Rabbi Akiba looked at her he spit, then he laughed and then he wept. The woman asked him, “What is the meaning of these things you do?” and he replied, “Two things I can explain to you but the third I cannot tell you. I spit because I remembered the process whereby a person is brought into the world. I wept because I thought of your beauty which will end by rotting in the ground.”
And why did he laugh? The legend concludes that he laughed because he foresaw with the aid of the Holy Spirit that she would become converted and that he would marry her. But this he refused to tell her.<sup class="footnote-marker">36)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדרים נ׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Although learning was forbidden, Rabbi Akiba found frequent oportunities to express his teachings even when he was in prison. It may also be assumed that the six rules which he gave to his son were formulated in prison.
In addition there exist some maxims of Rabbi Akiba which bear the stamp of having been expressed in similar circumstances. Thus he said that five types of sinners can never be forgiven: 1) One who repents too much. 2) One who sins too often. 3) One who sins when others are pious. 4) One who sins with the intention of repenting. 5) One who causes the desecration of the name of God by his sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">37)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק ל״ם.</span></i>
Another time he poetically interpreted a verse of the Song of Songs that the Gentile nations ask the Jewish people, “How is your lover different from other lovers?”, how is your God different from other gods that you allow yourself to be killed for his sake? Such heroic people as you are could easily come and mingle with us. But the congregation of Israel replies: “My lover is clear and radiant, he is higher than ten thousand.”<sup class="footnote-marker">38)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכילתא פּרשה ט״ו.</span></i>
It is characteristic of the end of Rabbi Akiba that Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus once foretold that he would meet a violent death. During an argument concerning the preparation of sacrifices for slaughter on the Sabbath, Rabbi Eliezer became annoyed at Rabbi Akiba’s numerous questions and he said angrily: “You have contradicted me in matters of slaughter and you will meet your death in slaughter.”<sup class="footnote-marker">39)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים ס״ט א׳.</span></i>

The Ten Martyrs

L<small>EGEND</small> R<small>ECORDS</small> that about the time of the destruction of Betar, or immediately after that event, the Roman governor of Palestine had ten of the most prominent Jewish leaders executed in a most barbarous fashion.
Emperor Hadrian—so relates Midrash Eicha Rabathi—then undertook to wipe off the Jewish people from the face of the earth and he was assisted in this plan by his governor, Tyranos Rufus, who served as executioner. It was the habit of the emperor, or of one of his representatives, to sit at the gate of the city and to await any passing Jew who would then be captured and executed.
While doing so the Romans made merry over the fate of the unfortunate Jews. If a Jew greeted a Roman, he would be addressed in the following words: “How dare you, a Jew, greet me? You are probably trying to deceive me with your greeting while you curse me in your heart. You therefore deserve to be put to death.” But if the Jew did not greet the Roman he would be addressed in this wise: “There goes a Jew who shows no respect for his emperor, he therefore deserves to be put to death.”
It seems probable that thousands of Jews lost their lives in this manner. This is evident from the Talmud<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים נ׳ א׳, בבא בתרא י׳ ב׳.</span></i> which cites a statement of the scholars to the effect that a man who lost his life for the reason of his being a Jew becomes sanctified and no one else may equal him in merit.
Although the martyrs numbered in the thousands, legend conferred a special saintly halo upon ten of them. This legend mentions the names of the Ten Martyrs and it has been established historically that these were executed by the Romans although they did not all die at the same time.
The story of the “Ten Martyrs” is retold twice each year; once during the recitation of the Laments on the ninth day of Ab and the second time during the afternoon service of the Day of Atonement.
The author of the mentioned Lament as well as the author of the other prayer followed the story of the events as they are related in the Midrashim where the names of the martyrs are listed in two different versions.
These men were executed—the legend continues to relate—when they were reading the Torah to the empreror and they came to the law which states that a person who steals a man and enslaves him, is to be put to death. (Ex. 21:16.) The emperor then said: “Where are your forefathers, the sons of Jacob, who sold their brother into slavery? If I had them here I would immediately have them put to death. But since they are not here you will have to atone for their crime.”
The emperor then allowed them three days in which to prepare themselves for the execution. Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha said to his comrades: “If you will take upon yourself part of the sin, I will pronounce the <span dir="rtl">שם המפורש״</span>„ (the express name of God) and by its power I will ascend heaven to ascertain whether this decree is the will of God. If God willed it, we will bow to his will, otherwise I will try to undo the decree of the emperor with the power of God’s name.”
The other scholars answered, “Do whatever you can and we will assume our share of responsibility for the sin.”
After he pronounced the “Shem Hamforash” a strong wind arose and carried Rabbi Ishmael to heaven. There he met the angel Metateron whom he asked concerning the decree and the angel said to him, “I have heard it announced that ten of the greatest Jewish scholars are to lose their lives at the hands of the Roman government.” Rabbi Ishmael descended and found his comrades engaged in prayer and fasting. They then began to discuss the laws pertaining to Passover. A messenger of the emperor arrived and said to them: “You know that you have been condemned to death and you have the patience to engage in learned discussions.”
Thus the Midrash, and the authors of the lament and the mentioned prayer, describe the events of the martyrdom, which removed ten of the noblest Jewish men. But the Talmud states that they died at widely separated intervals. This is also evident from the “Book of Lineage” (<span dir="rtl">יוחסין</span>) who explicitly states that one must not be misled to believe that the Ten Martyrs were executed at the same time, for Rabbi Akiba lost his life sixty years later and the other scholars suffered martyrdom at a still later date.
According to Talmudic sources<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מסכת שמחות פרק ח׳, מכילתא פּ׳ משפּטים.</span></i> the first death sentence was pronounced upon Rabbi Simeon ben Gamliel and Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha. When Rabbi Ishmael was informed of the sentence he wept bitterly and Rabi Simeon said to him, “You should be happy that two steps from here you will be taken to the bosom of the saints. Why do you weep?” Rabbi Ishmael answered, “I do not weep because I have to die but because we are to be led to execution like common murderers.”
When the news of their death was announced to Rabbi Akiba and to Rabbi Jehuda ben Baba they said, “All Jews must realize that if good times were in the offing, these two, Rabbi Simeon and Rabbi Ishmael, would be among the first to benefit from them. But the Creator knows that terrible punishment is about to be visited upon the world and He therefore removed them from the earth.”
When Rabbi Akiba was killed the news was carried to Rabbi Jehuda ben Baba and to Rabbi Hanina ben Teradion. These rent their garments and donned sackcloth and said: “Hearken to us, brethren. Rabbi Akiba was killed not because he committed robbery, nor because he neglected God’s Torah. This is therefore a sign that evil times are about to come. We may therefore expect that before long there will not be a place in the Land of Israel which will not be strewn with human bodies.”
Rabbi Jehuda ben Baba, another one of the Ten Martyrs, lost his life during the period of the decree against ordination. He was a pupil of Shmuel the Younger (Hakatan) and later he was a colleague of Rabbi Akiba in Jabneh and he frequently debated with him the regulations of Jewish life.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספתא סוטה פרק י״ג.</span></i> When the persecution was in full force he ruled that weddings were legal even when performed in the presence of one witness. When testimony was taken regarding the various Jewish customs, he related that on one occasion in Jerusalem a rooster was condemned to be stoned to death for killing a child in its crib by piercing its head with its beak. He was renowned for his piety and all Talmudic stories which begin with the words, “It once occurred to a pious man” refer to Rabbi Jehuda ben Baba; only in a few exceptional cases do these refer to R. Jehuda ben Elai.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא ק״ג ב׳.</span></i>
It is further told of Rabbi Jehuda ben Baba that all his actions were motivated by piety and that, when he died, no one could remember any sinful deed committed by him except that he had kept a goat in his house, a thing which was forbidden by the scholars of Palestine because goats habitually graze in strangers’ fields. The reason why he kept a goat was that Rabbi Jehuda suffered from severe coughing and the doctors advised him to drink goat’s milk while it was still warm. To prevent his goat from entering strangers’ fields, he always kept it tied to the bed post. Nevertheless the scholars refused to enter his house when he was sick because of the “robber” which he housed<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי סוטה פרק ט׳ הלכה י׳.</span></i>.
At that time the government issued a decree forbidding the ordination of pupils and anyone who issued or received such ordination was to forfeit his life, and the city where such ordination was conferred was to be razed to the ground. Rabbi Jehuda ben Baba then took his place between two mountains, between the cities of Usha and Shefarom, in order to ordain his disciples. He reasoned that if he was to be caught there no city would suffer through his deed. There he ordained five or six of his pupils. Suddenly they noticed soldiers approaching and Rabbi Jehuda said to his pupils, “Children, flee from here.” “But what will happen to you?” they asked him. He answered, “I will lie down on the ground and pretend death.”
When the soldiers approached they saw what they thought to be a dead body, lying on the ground. Wishing to assure themselves that he was really dead they pierced his body with three hundred javelins until it was riddled like a sieve<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין י״ד א׳.</span></i>.
Such seems to have been the death of Rabbi Jehuda ben Baba. It is also more than certain that some of his pupils were captured and killed.
* * *
Among the Ten Martyrs there were also men like Rabbi Yeshebab the Scribe, and Rabbi Hutzpith the Interpreter, who did not head academies but were officials of the court in Jabneh. They therefore succeeded in hiding for some time in Sephoris but finally they were captured. Rabbi Yeshebab copied books of the Torah and recorded the proceedings of the Court. He was a pupil of Rabbi Akiba and later became his colleague and together they discussed various legal matters. The poverty of the Jews of Palestine was very great at that time and many people distributed the greater part of their possessions, despite the warning of Rabban Gamliel that one should not give away more than one fifth of his possessions<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי פּאה פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>.
According to another source it was not Rabban Gamliel but Rabbi Akiba who advised Rabbi Yeshebab to distribute no more than one-fifth of his possessions<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות נ׳ א׳.</span></i>. This suggestion was enacted as a law by the Sanhedrin in Usha<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערכין כ״ח א׳.</span></i>.
Of Rabbi Hutzpith we know that he was interpreter for the Sanhedrin in Jabneh. It was also his duty to explain the Torah to the uneducated men and the women. One legal opinion of his is cited in the question of “Prosbol.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">משנה שביעית פרק י׳.</span></i><sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּרוזבול</span> was a legal contract formula introduced by Hillel the Old for the benefit of people who loan money that they should suffer no losses on a Sabbatical year when all debts were cancelled.</i>)
Before the Roman executioner killed Rabbi Hutzpith, he had his tongue cut out and thrown away. Later it was seen that dogs were carrying the tongue and the scholars mourned that “The tongue which poured forth pearls should lie in the dust.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ל״ט א׳.</span></i>
* * *
Among the martyrs of that time there were also the brothers Pappus and Julianus. Even though they are not listed among the Ten Martyrs, they are mentioned in connection with Rabbi Akiba.<sup class="footnote-marker">**</sup><i class="footnote">Pappus ben Jehuda was a contemporary Tanai of Rabbi Akiba and the Talmud said of him that he was a just man.</i>)
According to the Talmud Pappus and Julianus were brothers and they were executed by Tyranos Rufus in the city of Lodakia. When a princess of the imperial family was found murdered, the Jews were held to be responsible and the Roman governor commanded that all the Jewish inhabitants of that city be killed. The two brothers appeared before the governor and assumed all blame for the murder of the princess. They thus saved the Jewish community from annihilation.
Another version describes the death of the two brothers in this manner. The emperor said to them: “If you belong to the same people as Mishael, Hanania and Azariah, then God will save you from my hands.” But the brothers replied, “Mishael, Hanania and Azariah were pious men and Nebuchadnezzar was a worthy king. Because of their merit a miracle occurred. But you are an ordinary wicked man and we are guilty. If you will not kill us, there will be others that will do so. But if you will kill us God will avenge our blood upon you.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ספרא פ׳ אמור.</span></i>
From the complicated tangle of legends which surrounds these men we may conclude that Pappus ben Jehuda believed in maintaining peaceful relations with Rome. When he saw Rabbi Akiba publicly teaching the Torah to his disciples, despite the prohibition of the government, he rebuked him. But when he was later himself arrested for some transgression and he was sentenced to death he said to Rabbi Akiba, “Happy are you Rabbi Akiba that you were captured while teaching God’s Torah, but woe to Pappus that he was captured because of some foolish deed.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ס״א ב׳.</span></i>
* * *
When the Roman government disbanded the central academy of the Sanhedrin in Jabneh and, after executing many of the scholars in Lud, forced the remaining ones to flee to Usha, there appeared a number of academies that were located in numerous towns that were difficult of access and where a measure of safety from the Romans existed. It was characteristic of these academies that every one knew of their existence despite the fact that any contact with them was punishable by death. Like Rabbi Akiba who insisted on continuing his teaching openly, Rabbi Hanina ben Teradion also scorned all danger and continued his educational work.
He often said that if two people are together and do not engage in “words of the Torah” it is a gathering of the scornful, but whenever two occupy themselves with the Torah, the Shechinah rests upon them. Even when a person is alone he should devote himself to study and God would reward him.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק ג׳ משנה ב׳.</span></i>
But it is important to remember that it was almost impossible for a person to study alone. Aside from the Scriptures there were no written books, and even the possession of a book of the Scriptures by one person was very rare. All study was done orally; one man read a verse from the book and offered his interpretation; the others questioned him or offered their own commentaries.
In the early years of his career Rabbi Hanina ben Teradion studied together with Rabbi Jose ben Kisma but it appears that Rabbi Jose departed when the situation became too dangerous and when learning of the Torah was declared to be an “offense” punishable by death. When Rabbi Jose fell sick before his death he was visited by Rabbi Hanina and he chided the latter for his daring in endangering his life because of his teachings. Rabbi Jose said, “God handed the government to the Romans. They destroyed his house, burned his temple, slaughtered the pious, the best men of our people, and now I hear that you gather disciples and teach them from the book of the Torah which you keep hidden in your bosom. Would it not be better for you to consider how all this will end?”
To this Rabbi Hanina replied, “God in heaven will have mercy!”
Rabbi Jose further said, “I speak to you logically and you answer about the mercy of heaven. I should not be surprised if you are captured with the book of the Torah in your possession.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שמחות פרק ח׳.</span></i>
This attitude of Rabbi Jose, his readiness to bow before the might of the Romans, was probably known to the authorities. He was highly regarded by the governor of Caesarea and when he died, Roman officials attended the funeral and mourned over his grave. While returning from the funeral, the Romans saw Rabbi Hanina ben Teradion with a book of the Torah expounding to his disciples who were seated about him. He was immediately brought to trial and condemned to be burned. His wife was also condemned to death and his daughter was sent away to a house of ill repute.
Together with Rabbi Hanina the Romans also captured his friend, Rabbi Elazar ben Parta who had to face charges on five different infractions of the law. When they both met, Rabbi Elazar said, “Woe is me that I was caught while breaking five different laws.” But Rabbi Hanina said to him, “You are a happy man indeed that you were arrested for five transgressions and you will certainly be saved from all of them. Your salvation is more certain because you devoted yourself to learning as well as to charitable deeds while I only engaged in learning.”
During his trial Rabbi Hanina bluntly declared that he was “fulfilling the command of God.” He was then wrapped in the book of the Torah which he kept in his bosom, he was surrounded with bundles of thin branches and these were set on fire. To prolong his agony the Romans placed moist wool over his heart.
The execution had to be witnessed by his daughter and his disciples, and his daughter exclaimed, “Woe is me, father, that I see you suffering like this.” Rabbi Hanina said to her, “If I were to burn alone, my suffering would be very great. But since I am being burned together with a book of the Torah I am certain that He who will punish the burning of the book will also avenge my death.”
Rabbi Hanina’s disciples then asked him, “Rabbi, what do you see?”, and he answered, “I see the parchment burning but the letters on it are flying upward.” His disciples said, “Open your mouth and let the fire enter it and you will die sooner,” but he answered, “I do not wish to hasten my death by my own act.”
Seeing this, the executioner who lit the fire asked Rabbi Hanina, “Rabbi, if I will increase the fire that you may die sooner, will you lead me into the world to come?”
Rabbi Hanina assured him that he would do so and the executioner removed the wool from over his heart and Rabbi Hanina at once expired.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה י״ז ב׳.</span></i>
* * *
Rabbi Elazar ben Parta, a kindly and scholarly man, was captured together with Rabbi Hanina. Of Rabbi Hanina it was said that he was very just in matters of charity but that he was always calculated and gave no more than his share. On one occasion only did the sums which he set aside for charity and for a Purim feast become mixed and he distributed the whole sum to the poor. This he afterward mentioned as an innovation.
Whether Rabbi Elazar ben Parta was saved from death remains unknown. If he was, then it was probably due to his leanings toward peace with Rome, as was also the attitude of Rabbi Jose ben Kisma. The legends regarding his defense against the accusations of the Romans indicate that in itself it would have been insufficient to save him from the bloodthirsty Romans. He was accused of devoting himself to learning and also of participating in the activities of the various robber bands which infested the land at that time. To these accusations he replied: “If you suspect me of devoting myself to the book, you cannot accuse me of using the sword, and if you accuse me of using the sword, you cannot suspect me of engaging in the study of the book. Since one is not true, the other also must be false.”
“If you did not engage in the study of the book,” the judges asked, “why do people call you Rabbi?”
“They call me Rabbi,” Rabbi Elazar replied, “because I am the teacher of the weavers.”
Wishing to test his knowledge of weaving, the judges commanded that a piece of woven cloth be brought and he was told to point out the warp and the woof. At that moment a miracle occurred and a drone alighted on a thread of the warp while a bee descended on a thread of the woof. Rabbi Elazar understood the significance of the insects’ action and he convinced the Romans of his knowledge of weaving.
“Why were you absent from the meetings of ‘Be Avidan’?” the judges continued to ask, and Rabbi Elazar replied that being an old man he was afraid of being crushed in the melee. The judges at first refused to accept this reason but another miracle occurred and on the same day an old man was crushed at the meeting of “Be Avidan”.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">I have previously remarked that “Be Avidan” was a place where public disputes between Jews and their opponents took place. The exact meaning of the name has not been clarified to this day. Some claim that it should be read “Be Ebion” and that it indicates that the disputes were with the early Christians who were then referred to as Ebionim, while others maintain that it was the name of a Persian sect and the disputes were with Persians. Since Rabbi Elazar was accused of not coming to the gathering at “Be Avidan”, it would seem to indicate that the disputes were not with Christians nor with Persians.</i>)
“And why did you liberate your slave?”, the judge further queried. But Rabbi Elazar denied this. One of the witnesses was ready to testify against him when the prophet Elijah appeared in the guise of a Roman official and said, “Since miracles already occurred to substantiate his statements, it is probable that another miracle will occur.”
In justification of the severe punishment which was meted out to Rabbi Hanina ben Teradion—Rabbi Hanina was burned, his wife was killed and his daughter was sent away to a house of shame—the scholars later declared that he deserved it because of his sins. Rabbi Hanina frequently employed the <span dir="rtl">שם המפורש״</span>„ his wife heard him pronounce it but never warned him to refrain while his daughter once passed by a group of Roman officials and heard them praise her graceful bearing; she was then filled with pride and her fate in later life was a punishment for this pride.
A second daughter of Rabbi Hanina became the wife of Rabbi Meir and she too met with much suffering because of her original convictions about women. It is also noteworthy that on an occasion, when the scholars debated a legal matter, a son and a daughter of Rabbi Hanina participated in the discussions. At that time Rabbi Jehuda ben Baba said that Rabbi Hanina’s daughter showed a better understanding of the law than her brother did.
Rabbi Hanina’s son joined a brigand band during the life of his father. After the collapse of the revolt of Bar Kochba the remaining Jewish soldiers organized themselves into bands to conduct guerilla warfare against the Romans and they also looted and murdered wherever they could. The Romans applied all their efforts to rid the land of these bands. Rabbi Hanina’s son, who was a member of such a band, was caught by the Romans. They promised to spare his life if he would disclose secret information regarding the band. He did so and his comrades later killed him and stuffed his mouth with mud. Three days later his body was found and it was placed in a casket for burial. Out of respect for his parents the people were going to mourn him but Rabbi Hanina did not allow it.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שמחות פרק י״ב.</span></i>
We have previously mentioned that Rabbi Jose ben Kisma was an adherent of the movement for peace with the Romans. He was convinced nevertheless that in the end the Romans would be driven out of Palestine by the Persians after they would conquer Babylonia. He instructed his disciples that they should bury him in a very deep grave because “the time will come when there will not be a single palm tree in the Land of Israel but a Persian horse will be tied to it, and there will not be a single casket in the land that a Median horse will not feed from.”
At this time his disciples asked him when Messiah will come. At first he refused to tell them but when they insisted he said, “When the gate will be destroyed and rebuilt anew. Then it will be destroyed again, and before there will be time to rebuild it, Messiah will come.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין צ״ח א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jose did not explain which gate he was referring to and his statement was variously interpreted. “Yalkut Hamachiri” says that it refers to the gate of Tiberias; Rashi, on the other hand, claimed that it referred to the gate of Rome.
Further light is shed on the character of Rabbi Jose ben Kisma by the following story. It is told that a very wealthy man asked Rabbi Jose to settle in his city and he promised to reward him with much gold and silver and precious stones, but Rabbi Jose replied that were he to be offered all the gold and silver and precious stones of the world he would not reside anywhere except in a place of learning.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק ג׳ משנה ט׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Elazar ben Parta, who was captured together with Rabbi Hanina ben Teradion, left one law on the subject of a woman who is the wife of a Cohen and who is informed that her husband was travelling on a ship which became lost or that he was facing trial and in danger of losing his life, whether such a woman was entitled to eat of the tithes which are offered to a priest. Rabbi Elazar ruled that she was entitled to benefit from the tithes because the possibility existed that her husband might still escape alive.
It seems probable that Rabbi Elazar ben Parta was a pupil of Rabbi Eliezer of Modiin and a colleague of the scholars at Jabneh with whom he debated the interpretations of the laws. He said that since the destruction, the rains in Palestine had become lighter and less fruitful and that all of Palestine’s natural phenomena have changed; either there is too much or too little rain; sometimes it falls on time and at other times it is delayed. “When rain falls on time, what may it be compared to? It may be compared to a slave whose master gives him his pay on Sunday and he can bake his dough and eat his bread on time. But when rain does not fall on time what may it be compared to? It may be compared to a slave whose master gives him his pay at the end of the week; he cannot properly bake his dough or eat his bread on time.”<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית י״ט ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Elazar said that gossip is severely punished. This is obvious from the punishment which God meted out to the spies which Moses sent to see Palestine who slandered only trees and rocks upon their return. How much greater would be the punishment of one who slanders his neighbor.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערכין ט״ו א׳, תוספתא ערכין פרק ב׳.</span></i>
* * *
Another martyr was Hanina (or Hananiah) ben Hachinai, a disciple and a friend of the outstanding scholars of the time. It seems that he never received “Semicha” (ordination) to teach others in an academy of his own. His opinions, however, were held in great esteem and they were considered on numerous occasions when the laws were being determined.<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כלאים פרק ד׳ משנה ח׳, מכות פרק ג׳ משנה ט׳.</span></i> A few times he is referred to as Rabbi, but this seems to be an error of the copyists who could not imagine that the Mishna or Talmud should quote a man who was not ordained. His name is mentioned among the scholars who were said to know “seventy languages” and also in connection with other prominent men who did not possess the title of Rabbi such as Simeon ben Azai, Simeon ben Zoma and Hanan the Egyptian.<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין י״ז ב׳.</span></i> One of his opinions that was cited concerned the weight of the stones which Joshua erected in Gilgal after the Jews crossed the Jordan.<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה ל״ד א׳.</span></i>
His mode of thought is illustrated by a maxim which he frequently repeated: “He who wakes at night and he who walks alone by the way and he who makes his heart empty for idle thoughts is guilty against himself.”<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק ג׳ משנה ד׳.</span></i> Also interesting is his interpretation of the Biblical verse regarding a man who denies his friend. He said that a man who denies the words of his friend does so because he denies God.<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספתא שבועות פרק ג׳.</span></i>
Hanina studied for some time, together with other scholars, in the academy of Rabbi Tarphon. Later he became a disciple of Rabbi Akiba who found him worthy to discuss with him the mysteries of the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה י״ד ב׳.</span></i> On one occasion he argued against the viewpoint of Rabbi Akiba.<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדה נ״ב ב׳.</span></i>
Hanina attended the academy of Rabbi Akiba at Bnei Brak together with Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai.<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ס״ב ב׳, ויקרא רבה פּרשה כ״א פּיסקא ו׳.</span></i> They remained there about twelve or thirteen years. Throughout these years Rabbi Simeon received messages from his home and he was informed of what went on there, but Hanina never sent any message home and seemed not to be concerned about what happened there. One day he received a message from his wife: “Your daughter is ready to be wed and you must return at once to give her in marriage.”
Hanina received permission from his master to return home. During all these years the city and its buildings had changed and he did not know where to find the house in which his family lived. He sat down near the city well to await someone who could direct him. He then heard some girls addressing another girl, “Hanina’s daughter, fill your jar with water and go home.”
He followed this girl until he reached the house. When his wife saw him she fainted from great excitement. Hanina then stopped to pray and he addressed God in the following words, “Is this Your reward for the poor woman who waited for me so many years?” Realizing the justice of Hanina’s prayer God hearkened to it and the woman revived.
Hanina’s wife was well known for her kindliness. At that time the scholars interpreted the verse of the Bible “I will make a help against him” to mean that if a man is deserving, his wife is a help, but if he is not deserving she is against him. Rabbi Joshua b. Nehemiah amplified this interpretation and said that if a man is deserving he obtains a wife like the wife of Hanina ben Hachinai, but if he is not deserving he gets a wife like the wife of Rabbi Jose of Galilee.
* * *
Still another martyr of that time was Rabbi Jehuda the Baker. Whether he was really a baker, as his name would seem to indicate, remains unknown. He was very close to Rabbi Akiba and knew his life history. His word was therefore accepted in correcting an error regarding the dispute of Rabbi Akiba with Rabban Gamliel.
While trying to establish the day of the new month, Rabbi Akiba once delayed the testimony of people from his city. Rabban Gamliel then sent a message to Rabbi Akiba saying, “If you prevent the majority from fulfilling a commandment, you cause them to sin and you deserve to be ostracized.” The people believed that Rabbi Akiba was excommunicated but Rabbi Jehuda the Baker declared that it was not so and that Rabbi Akiba was only removed from his position of representing the city of Geder, which he then held.<sup class="footnote-marker">30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ראש השנה פרק א׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>
The legend regarding the tongue of Rabbi Hutzpith the Interpreter, which the Romans are said to have cut out and thrown to the dogs is given in the Jerusalem Talmud<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה פרק ב׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> as referring to Rabbi Jehuda the Baker, and it is said that it was Rabbi Jehuda who was thus tortured. There also exists a Midrash which relates that when Rabbi Jehuda the Baker was led to execution there came a man named Guphia who offered his life in place of Rabbi Jehuda. The Romans accepted the substitute but Rabbi Jehuda was later indicted on another charge of violating a Roman law and he was condemned to death.
* * *
The name of Rabbi Elazar Harsena is also listed among the Ten Martyrs and some historians identify him with Rabbi Elazar ben Harsom who was said to be the owner of a thousand cities on land and a thousand ships on the sea. From this wealth, which Rabbi Elazar is said to have inherited from his father, he derived no benefit. He would only take one sack of flour to bake the bread which he needed. He wandered from one city to another and visited the academies. When he returned to his house and wanted to enter, his own slaves did not know him and suspecting that it was a thief attempting to enter a strange house, they beat him.
Another version declares Rabbi Elazar ben Harsom to have been high priest for eleven years.<sup class="footnote-marker">32)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא ט׳ א׳.</span></i> This legend, however, must refer to another person than the martyr. Also no high priest of that name is mentioned by Josephus in his list of high priests. We may therefore assume that the legend refers to a person regarding whom all information had been lost and his name is confused with other historical personalities.

Simeon ben Azai and Simeon ben Zoma

(Two of the “Four Who Entered the Pardes”)
T<small>HE</small> T<small>ALMUD</small> relates that four of the most outstanding scholars entered the “Pardes”—the garden of knowledge—and with the power of their reason they sought to discover the causes underlying man’s life and the mysteries of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">The literal meaning of “Pardes” is a grove. The entrance of the four into the “Pardes” is explained by some commentators to show that by the power of sacred names they ascended heaven and were punished for looking at the “Shechina”. Later commentators explained the word “Pardes” according to its letters as symbolizing a four branched system of expounding the Torah— Peshat, (<span dir="rtl">פּשט</span>) simple explanation; Remez (<span dir="rtl">רמז</span>) hidden hints; Derash, (<span dir="rtl">דרש</span>) exposition; Sod, (<span dir="rtl">סוד</span>) mystical interpretation. Describing what they saw in the “Pardes”, the Talmud states that Rabbi Akiba warned his colleagues that when they come to the place of the “pure marble” they should not shout, “Water”. Rashi comments on this that the marble resembled water and Rabbi Akiba intended that they should not become discouraged and say: “Here is a body of water; how can we cross it?”</i>)
The affliction of the Jews were then indescribable. The Roman government endeavored with all its might to erase all trace of the Jewish faith. Since the Temple was destroyed, Judaism could only survive through the observance of such laws as had no direct relation to the temple. The government therefore prescribed the death sentence for the observance of Sabbath, for studying the Torah or for the circumcision of male children. If a person openly renounced Judaism, he joined the Romans or some other nationality and was granted Roman citizenship which insured his security.
Four of the outstanding scholars therefore attempted to discover the reason why God inflicted this suffering upon the Jews. These four were: Simeon ben Azai, Simeon ben Zoma, Elisha ben Avuyah and Rabbi Akiba. Ben Azai soon died from too much pondering; Ben Zoma lost his reason; Elisha ben Avuya “cut down the plants,” believing that God abandoned the Jews he said, “Of what avail is the Torah and why should we suffer to observe it?” He then abandoned the faith and became “Acher”, a stranger, an open enemy of the Torah and of those who clung to it. Only Rabbi Akiba suffered no harm and emerged unchanged from this venture. Rabbi Akiba’s strong spirit which mocked at death and which, at the very moment that Romans were tearing his flesh with iron combs, gave him the strength to declare that he was happy to be able to show his love of God even at the price of his life, this spirit penetrated the mysteries of Pardes without suffering any injury.
Simeon ben Azai, who died after pondering the mysteries, and Simeon ben Zoma who lost his reason, were members of Rabbi Akiba’s academy and were recognized as prominent disciples whose opinions were frequently sought.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין מ״ט ב׳, סנהדרין י״ז ב׳.</span></i> They were considered capable of heading separate academies although they were not confirmed<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">הוריות ב׳ ב׳.</span></i> and special honor was accorded to Ben Azai. Although unordained, he was at times called Rabbi<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות פרק ד׳ משנה י״ג, ידים פרק ג׳ משנה ה׳.</span></i> and when he differed with Rabbi Akiba his opinion is mentioned first at least on one occasion.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קהלת רבה פּרשה י׳ פּיסקא א׳.</span></i> At other times Rabbi Akiba retracted his opinions in favor of those of Ben Azai<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספתא שביעית פרק ב׳.</span></i> and once Ben Azai vanquished Rabbi Akiba in a debate to the complete satisfaction of the other scholars.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספתא בבא מציעא פרק ג׳.</span></i>
At first Ben Azai studied with Rabbi Tarphon<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספתא ברכות פרק ד׳.</span></i> then with Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah and later he became a disciple and friend of Rabbi Akiba.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא קנ״ח ב׳.</span></i> He then had many opportunities to inform Rabbi Akiba of the legal opinions of Rabbi Joshua.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא כ״ה א׳, יבמות מ״ט א׳.</span></i> but his adoration of Rabbi Akiba was so great that he once said that in his eyes “all the scholars taken together are of no more worth than the shell of garlic, except Rabbi Akiba,” to whom he referred as “the man with the bald head”.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בכורות נ״ח א׳.</span></i> This contempt for the scholars of his time was expressed by Ben Azai, who on another occasion warned against underestimating any person and believing anything to be impossible.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק ד׳ משנה ג׳.</span></i>
Ben Azai engaged in his scholastic work in Tiberias. He was famous for his unusual diligence and after his death it was said that all diligence has departed.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה מ״ט א׳.</span></i> His great devotion to learning led him to become estranged from his wife<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה ד׳ ב׳.</span></i> who was the daughter of Rabbi Akiba. Like her mother, she also sent her husband to an academy.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ס״ג א׳.</span></i> When Ben Azai once declared that “he who does not strive to bring children into the world may be compared to a murderer”, the people said to him “You preach well but you do not practice your own principles.” Ben Azai then answered, “I cannot help it. My heart yearns for the Torah and the world will have to recreate itself without me.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ס״ג ב׳.</span></i>
At the time of his death, Ben Azai was still a young man. From the descriptions of his life that we possess it is evident that his diligence, his renunciation of the joys of life and his piety contributed to his early death. His piety was known far and wide and people believed that “he who sees Ben Azai in his dream may expect to become pious.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות נ״ז ב׳.</span></i>
There exists another opinion that Ben Azai met with a violent death and that he was one of the first victims of Hadrian, but there is no historical substantiation for this point of view.
Ben Azai’s legal opinions are frequently quoted in the Mishna as in the case of the “red heifer” (<span dir="rtl">פּרה אדומה</span>) and also his belief that the Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes are sacred.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ידים פרק ג׳ משנה ה׳.</span></i> In this particular instance the discussion ends with the following words: “They agreed and decided according to the words of Ben Azai.” In the question of the advisability of teaching one’s daughters, Ben Azai was of the opinion that every father should teach the Torah to his daughter.<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה ב׳ א׳.</span></i> He also expressed an opinion regarding the time of the offering of tithes from cattle.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בכורות פרק ט׳ משנה ה׳.</span></i>
Ben Azai’s philosophy of life is expressed in some of his teachings which can rank with the most highly civilized ethical precepts. “Everyman whose understanding is clouded by his knowledge,” he said, “should be approved of; but it is a bad sign for a man if his knowledge is clouded by his understanding.”<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספתא ברכות פרק ג׳.</span></i>
His favorite maxim stated, “Be swift to fulfill a minor commandment even as you would an important one and flee from every transgression. For the reward of a commandment is a commandment and the reward of transgression is trangression.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק ד׳ משנה ב׳.</span></i> A more ample version of this maxim is given in Aboth d’Rabbi Nathan: “If you have fulfilled a commandment without regret you will be led to fulfilling other commandments; but if you have committed a trangression without regretting it, you will be led to commit other transgressions.”
“The observance of God’s commandments,” he said, “requires a strong will. Thus we are commanded not to eat blood and the Bible says ‘Be strong not to eat the blood’. Even though this is an easy commandment to fulfill we must be strong; how much stronger must we be to fulfill other commandments.”
He also said, “When does God show the just men the reward that He has prepared for them? When they are near death.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ס״ב, תנחומא פּרשת פּקודי.</span></i>
Another time he advised as follows: “When you seek a place to sit on, chose one which is a few steps lower than what you think you deserve. For it is better that you be told to go up rather than to descend.”<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק כ״ה.</span></i> The most important element of the Jewish faith is the Torah. Of this Ben Azai said: “Whoever allows himself to be humiliated for the honor of the Torah, will be honored in the end, and he who degrades himself for the sake of the words of the Torah will be elevated in the end.”<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה א׳, אבות דר׳ נתן פרק י״א.</span></i>
Ben Azai expressed numerous interesting opinions regarding various omens accompanying death according to which it was possible to judge the life of the patient. It is a good omen for a man to die with a clear conscience and without regretting his life. Other good signs are if wise men are pleased with one; when the patient dies with his face turned upward and looking at the people surrounding him and when his face becomes suffused with color.<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק כ״ה.</span></i>
One time the people asked Ben Azai to expound the Lamentations. He then said: “The Lamentations begin with the word ‘Eicha’ and it should be explained according to its letters. The Aleph indicates that the Jews were exiled when they denied their only God; the Yud shows that they abandoned the ten commandments; the Chaf proves that they did not fulfill the commandment of circumsion which was given twenty generations after the creation of the world; the Heh shows that they denied the five books of the Torah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">איכה רבתי פּרשה א׳.</span></i> (Use is here made of the substitution of Hebrew letters for numbers: Aleph, 1; Chaf, 20; Yud, 10; Heh, 5.)
Legend relates that when Ben Azai was expounding he was surrounded by tongues of flame. The people thought that he was explaining the mysteries of the “Divine Chariot,” but it was only an ordinary exposition of the Torah. He then explained that the tongues of fire were caused by the joy of the Torah which remains new as on the day that it was given from Mount Sinai. Since the Torah was handed down in fire it is always accompanied by fire.<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שיר השירים רבה פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא י׳.</span></i>
Aside from his underestimation of his colleagues, Ben Azai scorned those scholars who were not interested in gaining learning but merely wished to test their teachers. Of such people he said, “It is easier to conquer the whole world than to sit in front of people who wrap themselves in their shawls and whose faces one cannot see.”<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק כ״ה.</span></i>
In his method of exposition Ben Azai followed in the footsteps of Rabbi Akiba. At times he amplified words of Rabbi Akiba with his own interpretation. Thus Rabbi Akiba said that it was because of the merit of the Jews that God spoke to Moses. Ben Azai expanded this statement to indicate that not only to Moses but to all other prophets God spoke because of the merit of the Jews. Another time he modified Rabbi Akiba’s explanation of the duty to serve God with one’s whole soul in a manner that would prove that man must be ready to give his soul for the privilege of observing God’s commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספתא ברכות פרק ו׳.</span></i>
Ben Azai believed in moralizing people with a view to improving them. When he was asked: “How far must one go in his moralizing, whether until the person preached to is ready to fight or to curse, he answered that it was enough if such a person began to scold.<sup class="footnote-marker">30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערכין ט״ז ב׳.</span></i>

Simeon ben Zoma was another one of the four who entered the “Garden of Knowledge” in an attempt to determine the ways of heaven and earth and to fathom that which was before the world was created and that which will be after the world will cease to be.
Together with Ben Azai he was a pupil of Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah and later they both joined the academy of Rabbi Akiba who treated them as comrades and disciples. At the same time that Ben Azai met with an untimely death as a result of his attempt to fathom problems which no human reason can conceive, Ben Zoma went out of his mind and also died soon after that. Despite the fact that he was not ordained, Ben Zoma is twice referred to as Rabbi in the Talmud<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ו׳ ב׳, חולין פּ״ג א׳.</span></i> and he was listed among those disciples who attended the Sanhedrin and whose opinions were sought in discussing the laws.<sup class="footnote-marker">32)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין י״ז ב׳.</span></i> He was also prominent as a preacher and at his death it was said that good preaching has ceased.<sup class="footnote-marker">33)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה מ״ט א׳.</span></i> The high esteem in which his education was held by the people may be gauged from the popular belief that a person who sees Ben Zoma in his dream may surely expect an increase in wisdom.<sup class="footnote-marker">34)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות נ״ז ב׳.</span></i>
Very few of his Scriptural interpretations have come down to us, but those that are in existence indicate a brilliant mind that was somewhat eccentric from too much pondering. The Midrash cites<sup class="footnote-marker">35)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ד׳ פּיסקא ז׳.</span></i> that when the verse “And God made the sky” was being discussed Ben Zoma severely questioned its implication that God had to make the sky instead of creating it by pronouncing the word. The scholars frequently turned to him for advice and his opinion was taken as that of an authority.<sup class="footnote-marker">36)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות מ״א ב׳, חגיגה י״ד ב׳.</span></i> When the question of the offerings that were to be brought by a Nazarite was being debated, Ben Zoma differed with his teacher Rabbi Joshua and his opinion was established as the law.<sup class="footnote-marker">37)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נזיר נ״ט ב׳.</span></i>
When Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah was elected Nasi, he declared that he could never convince his colleagues of the necessity of reciting the chapter on “Tzitzith”, which includes the mention of the deliverance from Egypt, during the evening Shema until Ben Zoma proved it from the Biblical verse “And you shall remember the day of your deliverance from Egypt all the days of your life” by concluding that the word “all” implies the obligation to mention the deliverance at night as well as during the day. But Ben Zoma could not understand the saying of the scholars that the deliverance from Egypt would have to be mentioned even after the coming of the Messiah until they derived their conclusion from the same word.<sup class="footnote-marker">38)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות י״ב ב׳, תוספתא ברכות פרק א׳, מכילתא פּ׳ בא ט״ז.</span></i>
The favorite maxim of Ben Zoma stated, “Who is wise? He who learns from every man! Who is strong? He who conquers his passions! Who is rich? He who is satisfied with his portion! Who is honored? He who honors others!”<sup class="footnote-marker">39)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק ה׳ משנה א׳.</span></i> Aboth d’Rabbi Nathan adds the following to this maxim: “Who is a most modest man? He who is as modest as Moses! One who controls his passions may be compared to a man who conquers a city full of warriors.”
It is related that Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah once walked on the military highway and he met Ben Zoma who was so preoccupied with his thoughts that he did not even notice his teacher and did not greet him. Rabbi Joshua stopped Ben Zoma and asked him: “Whence do you come and whither are you going, Ben Zoma?” And he replied: “I was contemplating the upper and the lower waters and I have discovered that the space between them is no more than the breadth of three fingers.”<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">The Biblical verse “Let there be a sky within the water and let it separate between water and water” was interpreted by the scholars to indicate that there exists water in heaven just as on earth. But on this occasion Ben Zoma’s words are unintelligible as is also the subsequent remark of Rabbi Joshua.<br>It is characteristic of the four who entered the Pardes that they all spoke of the upper waters. Before entering the Pardes, Rabbi Akiba warned them not to exclaim “Water, water” when they will see the clear marble stones.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">40)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה ט״ו א׳.</span></i>
When Rabbi Joshua heard his words he remarked to his pupils, “You see, Ben Zoma still stands without.” A short time after that Ben Zoma died.<sup class="footnote-marker">41)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספתא חגיגה פרק ב׳.</span></i>
Another time Ben Zoma saw a great concourse of people and he said, “Praised be God who probes all mysteries and who created so many people, no two of which have like faces nor like opinions and He nevertheless knows what transpires in the heart of each of them; and all these He created to serve me.”
Ben Zoma also marvelled at human progress and said: “Let us consider how much effort Adam had to exert before he could eat a piece of bread. He had to plow the field and sow the seed and harvest the grain then bind and thresh and winnow and select the grains, after that he ground the wheat and sifted the flour and kneaded the dough and baked it and only then could he eat bread; but I rise in the morning and find it all prepared and ready for my use.”
Speaking in the same vein he also said: “Let us consider the efforts of Adam before he had a garment to wear. He had to shear the wool or reap the flax then he had to comb the wool or beat the flax and after that he had to spin and weave it and only then could he wear a garment; but I rise in the morning and find it ready for my use. All the artisans of the world diligently toil to prepare all these for my satisfaction.”
Another time he said: “When a respectable person goes visiting, what does he say? May the name of my host be praised for the effort which he exerted on my behalf. How many wines and cakes and other good things he prepared for my sake. But when an ungrateful man goes visiting, what does he say? Whatever the host did, he did for his own wife and children. For how much did I consume? Only one slice of bread and one piece of cake and one glass of wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">42)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות נ״ח א׳, תוספתא ברכות פרק ז׳.</span></i>
Some commentators explain this saying of Ben Zoma as illustrating the attitudes of various types of people to God who prepared everything for the benefit of humanity. Some are willing to thank Him while others say that no thanks need be given because God wanted to have people on the earth and He therefore had to provide them with all their needs even as He provides for all the other creatures.

Elisha ben Avuya "Acher"

E<small>LISHA BEN</small> A<small>VUYAH</small> was the third member of the group of four who penetrated the Pardes of knowledge. Because of his unusual ideas regarding Judaism, which were held to be harmful to the faith, he came to be called “Acher”—the one who is different—and it was said that his delving into the mysteries of the faith confused him to such a degree that he finally came to oppose it. In the idiom of that day it was said that he “cut down the plants.”
When Elisha was still a student at the academy, everyone believed that he had no other interests outside of the Torah, but he read many Greek poems and books of philosophy filled his pockets. Years later, when the Roman government sought to suppress the Torah and forced the Jews to break its commandments, Elisha advised the enemy and pointed out to the Romans which labors a Jew may perform on the Sabbath without incurring a sin.
The “unclean” books which Elisha read are referred to in the Talmud as “books of the erroneous” and “books of the heretics.” Because of the severe persecutions, the faith of many became weakened and they turned to these sects. It would seem that Elisha hovered between the two, but the spark of Judaism continued to bum within him. He had absorbed too much of the Torah to be able to break away from it entirely.
It is difficult at this day to define the teachings of the Gnostics. They pondered the mysteries of the Godhead and employed both rationalism as well as mysticism in their attempt to solve the problem. An important question for them was the determination of the material from which God created the world. Recognizing that the world was motivated by various forces, they concluded that God in heaven had no control over events on earth. At first they believed that the world was created out of a definite material which they could not describe and they also believed that there existed forces which were not subject to the control of God and that the angels participated in the government of the world. Later they altogether denied the existence of a God who rules the world.
These doubters were considered harmful to the Jewish faith and they were persecuted and expelled from Jewish society. They then joined other sects, but they were also expelled from there. These confused spculations brought Elisha to a state of extreme pessimism and depression and he was haunted by a voice from heaven which seemed to announce: “Repent, all lost children, except Acher, for whom there is no repenance.”
Elisha believed that people suffer for the sins of their parents and he declared that when he was still a child his father sinned in vowing to make a scholar out of his son, not in order to fulfill the commandment of studying the Torah but out of pride. He was also oppressed by the weight of the sin of his mother who happened to pass by a house of idol worshiping when she was pregnant and inhaled the odors of the unclean sacrifices.
Concerning his origin Elisha told that his father was one of the wealthiest men in Jerusalem. On the day of Elisha’s circumcision, his father prepared a great feast and invited all the prominent men of the city among whom were the two greatest scholars of the day, Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanos and Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah. When the guests turned to idle conversation after the feast, Rabbi Eliezer said to Rabbi Joshua, “Let them speak of that which interests them while we will go to another room and discuss matters of the Torah.” When they began to discuss the Torah, a cloud of fire descended from heaven and enveloped them. Seeing this Avuyah said to them, “Do you wish to bum my house?” But they replied, “God forbid! We do not play with fire but are only discussing the Torah.” Avuyah then said, “If the power of the Torah is so great, then I vow that if my son will live to reach manhood I will consecrate him to the Torah.”
The Talmud relates that the name “Acher” by which Elisha was called was not given to him by the scholars but by a harlot. It is told that a decision was adopted in heaven that since Elisha embraced an “evil culture” and lost his share in the world to come, he was to be allowed to enjoy the pleasures of this world to the full. Elisha once encountered a harlot on the street and asked her to go with him but she said, “Are you not Elisha ben Avuyah whose name is renowned throughout the world?” He tried to prove that he was another person and, it being a Sabbath day, he pulled out a radish from a field and offered it to her. The woman then remarked, “If you do so, you must be someone else.” (Acher —a different one.) Since that time the name “Acher” clung to Elisha.
But despite Elisha’s heresies, he did not cease to study the Torah. Some even claim that he revered it to his dying day and praised those who fulfilled its commandments. Some of his sayings have become immortalized but it seems probable that the scholars refrained from acknowledging his authorship in many instances and even refused to quote them as having been stated by “Acher”. His statements generally dealt with secular and human problems. In only one instance is his name mentioned in connection with a regulation regarding mourning.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ׳ א׳.</span></i>
Elisha was the teacher of Rabbi Meir, who was also a disciple of Rabbi Akiba and who was held in great esteem by his colleagues. The name of Rabbi Meir is frequently mentioned as the author of many opinions; but whenever it was suspected that Rabbi Meir’s statements were based on the opinions of his teacher Elisha, such statement were referred to as “others say” (<span dir="rtl">אחרים אומרים</span>).
Legends surround all of Elisha’s accomplishments from his childhood till the day of his death. Thus it was told that he sought to uproot the Torah and went from one academy to another driving out the pupils and handing over the teachers to be executed by the government. He then used to say, “Why waste the time of innocent children with such things? Would it not be better if they were taught to be masons or carpenters, hunters or tailors?”
Another legend tells that when Elisha entered “Pardes”, he saw the angel Metateron whose duty it is to write down all the good deeds of the Jews once every day and he asked: “How is it that we have learned that none ever sit down in heaven for no weariness exists there but I saw the angel sitting when he recorded the deeds of the Jews. Is it possible that there are two kinds of forces which guide the world?”
The angel was then scourged with sixty fiery lashes to prove to Elisha that he had no more rights than the others. It was then asked, “Why should the angel have been punished?” The answer was given that the angel should have risen when he saw Elisha. But despite the punishment the angel was given the privilege of erasing all the good deeds of Elisha from the book of records.
It is probable that Elisha headed an academy before he was overcome by doubts and of his pupils Rabbi Meir attained prominence. Rabbi Meir said that he considered Elisha as one does a pomegranate—he ate the heart of the fruit and threw away the skin. Rabbi Meir sought every opportunity to listen to Elisha in an attempt to learn something new from him. Once on a Sabbath, Rabbi Meir was sitting with his pupils in the academy when he was informed that Elisha was riding by. Rabbi Meir went out to hear what Elisha had to say, but Elisha continued riding on his horse and Rabbi Meir followed him. When they approached the limit which one is allowed to walk on the Sabbath, Elisha said, “Turn back Meir for you may go no farther. By the walk of my horse I recognize that we have reached the limit of the distance one may walk on the Sabbath.”
Rabbi Meir then said, “Will you not return also?”, but Elisha answered, “I have told you long ago that I heard a voice from behind the scenes that all strayed children may repent except ‘Acher’.” Rabbi Meir insisted that they return to the academy. The first boy whom they met, Elisha asked what he had learned on that day and the boy replied, “There is no peace for the wicked, says God.” (Isaiah, 48:22) They then approached another academy and Elisha again asked the first boy whom they met what he had learned and the boy answered, “Even though you wash in much chalk and use much soap the stain of your sin will remain.” (Jeremiah, 2:22) They thus made the rounds of thirteen academies and in every instance the children recited verses which were bad omens. Finally they approached the thirteenth academy and the boy said that he had learned the verse, “To the wicked God says, why do you speak of my laws?” (Psalms, 50:16) The boy stammered while reciting and it seemed to Elisha that the boy said <span dir="rtl">אלישע</span> instead of <span dir="rtl">רשע</span> (wicked). Elisha became very angry and some say that he drew a dagger and killed the boy while others claim that he merely said, “If I had a dagger I would now kill you.”
Another time Elisha is said to have asked Rabbi Meir for his interpretation of the verse, “One against another God made them”. (Eccles. 7:14) Rabbi Meir said that whatever God created, He also created its opposite; He created high mountains and low hills; He created the seas and the rivers. Elisha then remarked, “Rabbi Akiba explained this verse otherwise. He said that God created just men and wicked men; He created a Paradise and a Gehenna. Every Jew may therefore choose between two shares, one in Paradise and one in Gehenna. If he is a just man he takes his own and his neighbor’s share in Paradise; if he is a wicked man he takes his own and his neighbor’s share in Gehenna.
Elisha also asked Rabbi Meir’s explanation of the verse, “She may not be valued in gold or in glass and vessels of pure gold are not her equal.” (Job, 28:17.) Rabbi Meir declared that the verse refers to the Torah which can not be valued in gold but is broken as easily as glass. Elisha said, “Not so did your teacher Rabbi Akiba say. He said that just as golden and glass vessels may be mended after they are broken, even so may a sinful scholar be made whole again.”
“Will you not repent now?” Rabbi Meir said. But Elisha answered, “I am lost for I heard a voice that all may repent except Acher.”
The Talmud further relates that when Elisha died it was said in heaven that he can neither be judged nor can he have a share in the world to come. He could not be judged because he devoted himself to the Torah and he lost his share in the world to come because of his sins. Rabbi Meir said that it was better that he be judged that he may afterward regain his share in the world to come. “When I die,” Rabbi Meir said, “you will see smoke coming out of Elisha’s grave for I will certainly bring him to judgment because of his knowledge of the Torah.” Afterward Rabbi Meir also told that when Elisha was nearing death he wept because of his sins and it seemed that he repented in his heart.
After Elisha’s death his daughter (the Jerusalem Talmud says his daughters) came to Rabbi Jehuda the Nasi to ask for bread. Rabbi Jehuda asked her who she was and she said, “I am the daughter of Elisha.” Rabbi Jehuda wondered that such a wicked man had children who remained Jews but the daughter pleaded, “Remember his Torah and overlook his deeds.” Fire then descended from heaven and enveloped Rabbi Jehuda. Rabbi Jehuda wept and said, “If this happens to those who dishonor the Torah, how much more can happen to those who glory in it?”
Some historians maintain that one of the reasons for Elisha’s abandonment of Judaism was his great envy of Rabbi Akiba. Elisha felt humiliated that a man of unknown origin who began his studies in his later years should be elevated to such a high position by the people. He then said, “He who learns when a youth may be compared to one writing with ink on new paper, but when one begins his studies after he is old it may be compared to writing on erased paper.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק ד׳ משנה י״ט.</span></i> This is more exactly expressed in Aboth d’Rabbi Nathan: “He who studies in his youth absorbs the words of the Torah into his blood and they come clearly out of his mouth; but he who studies when he is old does not absorb the words of the Torah into his blood and they come out of his mouth indistinct.”
From Rabbi Akiba’s statements we may conclude that he was an enemy of Elisha. Rabbi Akiba opposed Greek philosophy and said that whoever studies it loses his share in the world to come. Since Elisha devoted himself to Greek writings we may assume that Rabbi Akiba’s words were directed at him.
Elisha seems to have had no sympathy with the movement of rebellion against Rome. When the Roman government began to persecute the students of the Torah, Elisha maintained, as did many other scholars, that one must not endanger his life for it.
A Talmudic legend traces the beginning of Elisha’s doubts to his having seen a man climb a tree to remove a nest containing both fledglings and the mother bird. Although this was against the commandment of the Torah, nothing happened to the man. The following day he saw another man removing a nest with fledglings but the man sent the mother bird away, as the Torah commanded. Although the fulfillment of this commandment is to be rewarded by long life, the man was bitten by a snake when he descended from the tree and he immediately died. Elisha then asked, “Where is the long life that was promised to the man?” Others said that he began to doubt when he saw the tongue of Rabbi Jeduha the Baker (or of Rabbi Hutzpith the Interpreter) dragged around by dogs. Elisha then came to the conclusion that there was no reward for just men and he also lost his belief in the resurrection of the dead.
We have already remarked that there probably exist numerous opinions of Elisha whose authorship is not acknowledged. But Aboth d’Rabbi Nathan contains a chapter devoted to Elisha’s sayings and to his opinions regarding men of great learning who also commit good deeds and men who only possess great learning. Elisha there says that a man of learning and of good deeds may be compared to a structure built on a foundation of stone while the walls are made of bricks; even the greatest flood cannot undermine such a structure. But a man who possesses much learning but no good deeds may be compared to a structure with a foundation of bricks and walls of stone. Such a structure is easily undermined.
Another statement of Elisha in the same book well characterizes the man. He said: “A man may study for twenty years and forget all his knowledge in two years so that he would not know to differentiate between the clean and the unclean and he would confuse the opinions of one scholar with those of another until he finally would have to remain silent.”
It thus becomes obvious that Elisha was a man of contradictions. At times he honored the Torah and was a friend of the scholars. On other occasions he was an enemy of the Torah and aided the Roman government in persecuting the scholars. He was always full of regrets and contemplated repentance but he was deeply convinced that he was beyond repentance because of his many sins.
Elisha’s greatest crime was his treason to his people and his aiding the enemy at a time of persecution against the Jews. His intentions might not have been treasonable and it is possible that he honestly believed that bowing to the will of the Romans was the best policy. But history has proved this opinion to be false and the attempts to placate the Romans have ended in catastrophe. It is therefore no wonder that Elisha was condemned.

Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel II

D<small>ESPITE ALL</small> the decrees and the false accusations which the Roman government levelled against the Jews in its attempt to eradicate their feeling of national solidarity and to make impossible their observance of the Torah, the Romans were unsuccessful. At the very moment that the oppression of the faith seemed to become intolerable, the Jews discovered a neighboring country where they could freely maintain their faith and openly live as Jews. This country was Babylonia. Babylonia was then ruled by the Parthians who withstood all efforts of the Romans to subjugate them and all the might of the Roman empire did not suffice to penetrate their borders.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">The ruling people of Babylonia were called Parthians after the river Euphrates which formed the boundary of their domain. They are not to be confused with the Persians who later conquered their country.</i>)
Hadrian, who was responsible for much of the suffering inflicted upon the Jews, died and was succeeded by Antoninus Pius who immediately lightened the burden of the Palestinian Jews. It seems that there occurred a rebellion of the non-Jewish population of Palestine which was supported by the Parthians. Wishing to placate the Jews and to prevent their participation in the uprising, Antoninus Pius ordered that they should be treated more kindly.
The news of the improved political position of the Palestinian Jews rapidly reached Babylonia and many of the exiles, together with a great number of the scholars who fled Palestine, began to return. Among these repatriates there was also Rabban Simeon the son of Rabban Gamliel of Jabneh. Upon his return he was elected Nasi as Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel the Second.
Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel II was a sixth generation descendant of Hillel and he was considered fit to hold the position of his forefathers. During the time of the Bar Kochba rebellion and the persecutions that followed it Rabban Simeon remained in hiding and none heard of him; but when the Romans later permitted the reorganization of the Sanhedrin they did not object to the election of Rabban Simeon as Nasi.
The newly reorganized Sanhedrin settled in Usha instead of Jabneh. Among the repatriates there also returned Rabbi Nathan the Babylonian, who was the son of the Exilarch of that country, and he was appointed head of the court. Rabbi Meir, the disciple of Elisha ben Avuyah, received the title of “Chacham” and was the third leader of the Sanhedrin.
But Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel was not elected Nasi merely because he was a descendant of Hillel. His elevation to this post was due primarily to his personal qualifications. The scholars knew him well from the time that he was a young man in his father’s house. At that time he strictly observed the commandment to honor one’s father and in spite of the fact that Rabban Gamliel possessed many slaves, Rabban Simeon diligently sought to serve him. He frequently complained that “no matter how much I serve my father it is not even a hundredth part of that which Esau did for his father Isaac.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ס״ה פּיסקא י״ב.</span></i>
As long as he was Nasi, Rabban Simeon sought to enhance the importance of that office. He once conceived the idea of doing away with the equality of the three leaders of the Sanhedrin which was the rule till that time. He then issued a regulation that when the Nasi entered the academy everyone was to rise and to remain standing until the Nasi would command them to be seated; when the head of the court entered, the people on both sides were to form two lines and were to remain standing until he was seated; when the “Chacham” entered everyone was to retain his position, whether seated or standing, until the “Chacham” took his seat.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">הוריות י״ג ב׳, תוספתא סנהדרין פרק ז׳, ירושלמי בכורים פּ״ג ה״ג.</span></i>
This regulation was issued on a day when neither Rabbi Nathan nor Rabbi Meir were in the academy. When they came on the following day they considered this regulation as an attempt to diminish their authority in the eyes of the people. They were both greatly angered and Rabbi Meir declared that by issuing this regulation the Nasi broke a long standing custom that a man may only be advanced in sacred authority but not demoted. They decided to repay the Nasi in kind and since they were considered to be better informed in matters of law than the Nasi was, they determined to confront him with questions which he would be unable to answer. In thus exposing the Nasi’s inadequate learning they hoped to have him deposed even as his father was once deposed.
Rabbi Nathan and Rabbi Meir decided to ask the Nasi to expound the regulations pertaining to the stems of fruit and its bearing on the cleanliness of the fruit. They expected to be able to confuse him very easily in these matters. But one of the Nasi’s devoted adherents heard of the plan and he thought that such questions and pilpulistic reasoning may bring shame on the Nasi. He therefore began to walk back and forth in front of the Nasi until he attracted his attention. He then told the Nasi of the plot and Rabban Simeon prepared himself for all possible questions. To make doubly sure, he did not allow Rabbi Nathan and Rabbi Meir to enter the academy on that day. They then sent in their questions in writing from the outside and Rabban Simeon sought to answer them as best he could. Whenever he was in doubt regarding some matter, the two on the outside sent in their answers.
Seeing this game Rabbi Jose ben Chalafta said to the Nasi: “The Torah remains outside while we sit calmly within.” Rabban Simeon permitted the two expelled scholars to return but he ruled that all laws which were to be enacted according to their opinions from that day on should not be quoted in their names. This ruling was adopted and all the laws determined by Rabbi Nathan were prefaced by “some say” (<span dir="rtl">יש אומרים</span>) while those of Rabbi Meir were quoted as “others say” (<span dir="rtl">אחרים אומרים</span>).
Some time later both Rabbi Nathan and Rabbi Meir beheld a dream in which they were told to become reconciled to the Nasi. Rabbi Nathan obeyed the dream: he bowed before the will of the Nasi and submitted to punishment, but Rabbi Meir refused to submit and he declared that all dreams were vain. The Nasi brought the matter before the scholars and they decided to excommunicate Rabbi Meir. When he heard of it he sent word to the scholars warning them not to take this unjust step and also that he would not recognize the excommunication.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי מועד קטן פרק ג׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
In the end Rabbi Meir had to leave Palestine and he settled in a city of Asia Minor, where he remained until his death. Before his death he sent a message to Palestine saying: “Your Messiah (!) died on strange soil.” He also commanded that he be buried on the shore of the sea which touches Palestine so that it should be the same as if he was buried in that country.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי כלאים פרק ט׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
In his exposition Rabban Simeon followed his own method. He taught his disciples only those laws which had been sanctioned by the great court and he avoided all those which were in doubt or concerning which there were differences of opinion and which had not yet been discussed with the consent of the majority of the scholars. Whenever people came to him for trial in money matters he ruled that the custom of the country and common sense must determine the judgment even when the scholars arrived at differing conclusions from the text of the Bible. Rabban Simeon also tried to raise the prestige of the court and he said that the decision of a judge must be considered as the law.
In his father’s house there were many scholars who studied Greek and Rabban Simeon declared that it was permissible to write a book of the Torah in that language.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה ה׳ ב׳.</span></i> Another time he declared that only in the Greek language was it possible to make a correct translation of the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי מגלה פרק א׳ הלכה ט׳.</span></i> He was also versed in the natural sciences and in horticulture,<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים נ״ג א׳.</span></i> and he was acquainted with the sciences of anatomy and medicine. When he was consulted regarding problems of marital life or concerning the laws which forbid or allow certain actions, he always paid more attention to the intent of an action rather than to its superficial aspect.
Rabban Simeon sided with the weak against the strong and he supported the rights of women in the laws of a “Kethubah”. He demanded justice for Gentile slaves and declared that people are commanded to redeem slaves just as they are obliged to ransom free men who had been kidnapped.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ל״ז ב׳.</span></i> He supported capital punishment for murderers in order to prevent the increase of murderers among Jews. This conviction he held against the opinion of many scholars who were opposed to capital punishment.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכות ז׳ א׳.</span></i>
Being tolerant toward people of other faiths Rabban Simeon said that a Gentile who appears before a Jewish court should be judged according to Jewish law.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ספרי פּרשה י״ח.</span></i> Documents of indebtedness which were signed by non-Jews he held to be valid and, in opposition to the conviction of other scholars, he maintained that Samaritans were to be considered as Jews in all matters for every commandment which the Samaritans undertook to observe they observed more scrupulously than the Jews.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ט״ו ב׳.</span></i>
Rabban Simeon said that the world is based on three things: truth, justice and peace.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק א׳ משנה י״ח.</span></i> In his lectures he stressed the value of peace and declared that numerous passages of the Torah use ambiguous language out of a desire for peace.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי פּאה פרק א׳, ויקרא רבה פּרשה ט׳ פּיסקא ט׳.</span></i> On another occasion he declared that “he who makes peace in his own home is like one who makes peace among all Jews.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק כ״ח.</span></i>
Rabban Simeon was raised in royal splendor in his father’s house and for this reason he frequently complained that Jewish life had lost its glamor of days past and that even nature had changed in Palestine in comparison with earlier days. In days gone by God had shown his love for Israel and sometimes even changed the course of natural events for their sake.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שמות רבה פּרשה ל״ח פּיסקא ה׳.</span></i> But since the destruction of the temple the dew no longer causes the plants to grow and the fruit has lost its taste.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספתא סוטה פרק ט״ו.</span></i>
All the religious innovations which his father introduced in Jabneh, such as the lighting of candles in honor of the Sabbath, Rabban Simeon sought to establish in Usha. In this attempt, however, he met with but little success. He often recounted the memories of early days, when the temple was still in existence, which he heard in his father’s house. He would gladly have introduced in Usha all the customs of which he had heard were it not for the opposition which he met from other scholars.
He also endeavored to strengthen the office of Nasi with an eye to establishing the rule of the dynasty. Since he was the sixth Nasi descended from Hillel, he believed that a scion of the dynasty was entitled to the office of Nasi even if he was not the greatest in his generation and that it was inconceivable for a member of another family to occupy the post. This effort of his was especially strengthened by the remembrance that when his grandfather Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel the Elder was killed by the Romans, he was not immediately succeeded by his son. When the son was later elected Nasi he was afterward deposed for a short time. After the death of Rabban Gamliel of Jabneh, the office was not at once conferred upon the rightful heir and other candidates were tested first. He was especially impelled by the desire to avoid in the future any repetition of that which happened to his father and which almost happened to himself—that a sudden opposition to the actions or the opinions of the Nasi should make it possible to have him deposed.
With a special poignancy Rabban Simeon used to tell of the time before the temple was destroyed. His father saw the temple when he was still a child and he repeated his memories to Rabban Simeon. He told that Jews had no holidays happier than the fifteenth day of Ab and the Day of Atonement when the girls all paraded through the streets dressed in white garments which they borrowed from one another in order not to shame those which did not possess any. Afterward they danced in the vineyards and called upon the young men who came to watch them to choose the most beautiful or the wisest as their brides.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית כ״ו ב׳, בבא בתרא קכ״א א׳.</span></i>
He also told of the Jerusalem custom of receiving guests that the host would offer them the use of the house and would himself remain outdoors overnight,<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק ל״ח.</span></i> and of the river Shiloah whose waters welled out through an opening no larger than a copper coin. When the king commanded that the mouth of the river be widened, the quantity of water decreased; the king therefore ordered that the opening be sealed again and the water continued to flow as heretofore. Rabban Simeon also declared that there was no organ in the temple because it was liable to interfere with the harmony of the singers although that instrument is pleasing to the ear by itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערכין י׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel recounted these stories because he wanted to maintain the patriotic fervor of the people for Jerusalem and he was also convinced that the city would regain its old splendor even in his day. He believed that when the Jews would be liberated from the Roman yoke Jerusalem would become a center for all surrounding nations and that people would flock thither to learn the true faith. Because of his devotion to Jerusalem he stressed the significance of Tisha b’Ab and declared that one who breaks the fast of Tisha b’Ab is like one who eats on the Day of Atonement.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית ל׳ ב׳.</span></i>
For although the government persisted in its persecutions, the people seemed to have become accustomed to these and as long as the existence of the Sanhedrin was permitted the people did not complain much of the other forms of oppression. This is evident from the saying of Rabban Simeon that “our forefathers could not endure even a little suffering but we who suffer for so many generations have more cause to lose our patience.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">איכה רבתי פּרשה ח׳ פּיסקא י׳.</span></i> Another time he said: “We have learned to love our sufferings but were we to write them down, we would not have enough strength.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת י״ג ב׳.</span></i>
Some people once approached Rabban Simeon and attempted to persuade him that it would be well for the Jews to aid the Egyptians in an attempt to overthrow the Romans and Rabban Simeon said to them, “If we look at the wealthy and wicked government we can see that all its regiments are always occupied both day and night but when we look at Egypt we see its soldiers always idle. How then can we hope to be victorious with their help?”<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכילתא פּרשת י״ד.</span></i>
From the previously described behavior of Rabban Simeon one may get the impression that he was a proud man. Such a conclusion, however, would be far from the truth for Rabban Simeon was renowned for his modesty. In the performance of his duties as Nasi he dictated his will and brooked no opposition, but in private life there could not be found another man as modest as he was. When in his capacity of Nasi he determined a leap year (<span dir="rtl">עבור</span>), he wrote to all the Jewish communities informing them that he consulted no one and made the decision himself—as against the custom of his father who wrote that he made the decision with the consent of his colleagues. But of his personal modesty an anecdote was being related of a man who vowed not to touch his wife until she would spit in the face of the Nasi. The woman did so and Rabban Simeon did not scold her. When Rabban Simeon’s son complained to him that he had been insulted by Rabbi Elazar ben Simeon, he said to him, “My son, pay no attention to it for Rabbi Elazar is a lion, the son of a lion, but you are only a lion, the son of a fox.”<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פּ״ד ב׳.</span></i>
Aside from the above mentioned sayings of Rabban Simeon, the following maxims are characteristic of his trend of thought:
Every commandment which the Jews joyfully accepted from Mount Sinai they continue to observe with joy and no amount of persecution will avail against them.<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ק״ל א׳.</span></i>

It might have been necessary to pass a law forbidding the eating of meat and the drinking of wine since the temple was destroyed; but such a law could not be enforced and it is therefore unnecessary to enact it. Ever since the government decreed that no one must engage in the study of the Torah it should have been necessary to enact a law that people should not marry and have children. The necessity for teaching the Torah to the children would then no longer exist. But one must not think of doing so and the Jews must be allowed to do as they wish and they will certainly find the right way to save themselves from the decrees.<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">הוריות ג׳ ב׳, תוספתא סוטה פרק ט״ו.</span></i>

It has been mentioned before that many Jews settled in the neighboring countries to escape the persecution of the Romans. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel strove to preserve the significance of Palestine as the center of the Jewish faith in the minds of the exiles and to prevent the establishment of another new religious center similar to the “Temple of Onias” in Alexandria. In this effort he was eminently successful.

Rabbi Nathan of Babylonia

T<small>HE CITY</small> of Usha was chosen as the seat of the Sanhedrin after that body was reorganized with the permission of the Roman emperor Antoninus Pius who ascended the throne some time after the destruction of Betar. At the time that Rome was almost successful in eradicating Judaism from Palestine there developed a new center of Jewish spiritual life in Babylonia, which was not subject to Roman rule. The city of Nehardea occupied a particularly prominent place in the life of the Jews because it was the seat of the Exilarch who represented the Babylonian Jews and who was granted special privileges by the Parthian government. Before Nehardea attained its importance, there was a large Jewish settlement in the city of Netsivin which was closer to Palestine but Hadrian’s legions reached this city and laid it waste and slaughtered its inhabitants. Among those that saved their lives there was also Rabbi Jehudah ben Bathyra II who later organized an academy. But he did not succeed in concentrating a large number of people about his academy because everyone sought to settle farther in the interior of Babylonia in order to be safe from Roman attacks. It was then that another scholar Hananiah (or Hanna) the nephew of Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah, selected Nehardea as his residence and established there a large academy.
When it became known in Babylonia that all religious activity in Palestine was being suppressed, Hananiah undertook to establish a Supreme Court. Feeling convinced that since the destruction of the temple the main duties of the court consisted in determining the leap years and establishing the dates for the festivals, he believed that these functions could just as well be fulfilled in Babylonia. But this situation was considered by the Palestinian scholars as an attempt to undermine their authority. The Nasi, Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel, especially objected to self established authorities outside of Palestine and he sent two special messengers to BabyIonia to attempt to change matters.
This mission to Babylonia is described in two differing versions.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">The story of this mission is described in Berachoth, 66 as well as in Jerushalmi Nedarim, 6:5 and in Sanhedrin, 1:5. The names of the messengers that are given in the Babylonian Talmud are different from those listed in the Jerusalem Talmud. The Jerusalem Talmud also omits the name of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel and only mentions “Rabbi” which might indicate that this event occurred during the days of the Nasi Rabbi Jehudah. But such an assumption is hardly probable since the office of the Nasi in Palestine during the time of Rabbi Jehudah was secure and it was unlikely that anyone in Babylonia would have tried to compete with the Palestinian leadership at that time.</i>)
It is told that the Nasi entrusted three letters to the messengers which he sent to Hananiah in Babylonia and he commanded them to show these letters one at a time. The first letter contained “greetings to the worthy holiness of Hananiah”. When the messengers were asked what their mission was in coming to Babylonia, they said that they came to study. Hananiah then presented them to his colleagues and said, “These are renowned men whose forefathers conducted the service in the temple.”
Later the messengers paid close attention to the expositions of Hananiah and attempted to prove to him that he was in error regarding various laws. Greatly angered Hananiah wanted to denounce them but they showed him the second letter of the Nasi which informed him that “the kids which he had left in Palestine had meanwhile grown up and developed sharp horns.”
Hananiah wanted to denounce the messengers from Palestine as swindlers but they said to him, “Since you believed our words before, you cannot now denounce us.” At the same time they also gave him the third letter of the Nasi in which Hananiah was commanded not to assume the right of establishing New Years and determining the Holidays. Hananiah objected that he had a right to do whatever he thought was best for the people and he also cited that Rabbi Akiba once determined a leap year when he was outside the boundaries of Palestine.
“Do not compare yourself to Rabbi Akiba,” the messengers answered, “for none could compare with him even in Palestine.”
“Neither did I leave in Palestine anyone that could compare with me,” Hananiah retorted.
The messengers then called his attention to the contents of the second letter which reminded him that the small people which he left in Palestine had grown in stature and that they commanded him, “if you will obey and depart from your ways all will be well, otherwise you will be driven out from the community of Israel and you can choose a place for an altar and sacrifices and music even as the Jews of Alexandria once did.”
When the messengers realized that Hananiah was still unwilling to submit, one of them ascended to read the Torah on the day that Hananiah declared to be a feast day, but he changed the text to read, “These are the holidays of Hananiah”. The audience immediately corrected him that he should read “These are the holidays of God”. The messenger replied, “It is true that in our books it is written ‘These are the holidays of God,’ but here one should substitute the name of Hananiah because he determines the holidays as he chooses and not as God commanded”.
Then the second messenger arose and recited a verse “Out of Babylon shall come the Torah”; the audience corrected him that he should say “Out of Zion”. The messenger replied: “In our books it is written ‘Out of Zion,’ but judging by your conduct you may write “Out of Babylon” in your books.”
All the people gathered began to weep and were ready to obey the words of the messengers from Palstine but Hananiah still refused to submit. He went to Rabbi Jehudah ben Bathyra of Netsivin to ask his advice. Rabbi Jehudah suggested that he submit because the Great Court of Palestine was the only body with authority to regulate the religious life of the people both within as well as outside of Palestine.
It is also related of Hananiah that he frequently travelled from Palestine to Babylonia but he was always grieved to leave the country. Once he was accompanied by Rabbi Jehudah ben Bathyra, Rabbi Mathia ben Harash and Rabbi Jonathan. When they reached the boundary of Palestine and bethought themselves of the land which they were leaving, they rent their garments and wept. Grieved at the thought of leaving the Land of Israel, they abandoned all thoughts of personal safety which awaited them in Babylonia and returned.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ספרי פּרשת ראה.</span></i>
Hananiah was a pupil of his uncle at Jabneh and later he mingled among the greatest men of his generation. When he fell sick, he was visited by the most outstanding persons but because of his frequent departures from Palestine and his attempt to rebel against the scholars of Palestine he was not ordained. Two or three times he is referred to in the Talmud as Rabbi but this appears to be an error of the copyists. His legal opinions are not quoted in the Mishna but they frequently appear in the “Boraitha”.<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">A “Boraitha” is an opinion on law which was not included in the Mishna, when it was compiled by Rabbi Jehudah, the Nasi. The “Boraithas” are scattered throughout the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds as well as in Mechilta, Safra and Sifri and usually are prefaced by the words “our teachers have taught us.’ (<span dir="rtl">תנו רבנן, תנן, תנינא, תניא</span>).</i>
Hananiah visited Babylonia several times and each time he returned to Palestine but after his clash with the messengers of the Nasi he remained in Babylonia permanently.
The reason that Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah sent his nephew, Hananiah, to Babylonia is said to have been due, not so much to the danger which threatened all scholars of Palestine as to the fact that the “Minim” (the Jewish Christians) cast a spell on him and he forgot which day it was and came riding to the academy on the Sabbath. Wishing to save him from this spell, his uncle sent him away to Babylonia.
The Jews of Babylonia lived in security and peace while the Jews of Palestine were being sorely oppressed. Even after the emperor Antoninus Pius alleviated their prosecutions and granted them freedom to observe all the customs of the Jewish faith, the situation of Palestine Jewry still could not compare to that of the Jews of Babylon who enjoyed autonomy in their religious life under the leadership of an Exilarch. But these differences in favor of Babylonia did not deter many Jews from returning to Palestine as soon as they heard of the improved situation in that country for everyone believed that in Babylonia he was removed from God and that God’s grace rested only in Palestine.
During the time that Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel was Nasi in Palestine Rabbi Nathan of Babylonia came to settle in that country and the Sanhedrin at Usha elected him head of the Court soon after his arrival. Rabbi Nathan was the son of the Exilarch as is evident from the remark of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel who said to him: “Now that you are head of the court because of the silver girdle of your father (the official symbol of the rank of the Exilarch) you should not strive to become Nasi.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">הוריות י״ג ב׳.</span></i>
There exists an opinion that Rabbi Nathan had visited Palestine before he was elected head of the court and that he was a pupil of Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha, Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus and of other scholars whom he later mentioned. But when the persecutions increased, he left the country and travelled through many lands until the political situation improved when Antoninus Pius ascended the throne.
He told that on one of his journeys there was brought before him a weak child of a woman whose two previous children died as a result of circumcision. He looked at the child and he saw that its skin was red and he commanded that circumcision be postponed until the blood would become diffused throughout its body.
During these journeys he kept informed on what transpired in Palestine and he was filled with great reverence for the Palestinian Jews who sacrificed their lives for the observance of the Torah. He related that walking in the street one could see Roman soldiers leading a Jew to execution and when the man was asked what he had done to deserve the punishment he said that he had circumcised his son; another man would be executed for studying the Torah. Further one could see a man being led to crucifixion and when asked what he had done he said I have eaten Matzoth on Passover” or one could see a man being scourged for taking up the Lulab.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכילתא, שמות פּ׳ כ׳.</span></i>
The editing of the Mishna into books and tractates was begun during the lifetime of Rabbi Nathan. His role in this labor is indefinite and there are only two references in the Talmud to the existence of a Mishna of Rabbi Nathan.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות צ״ב ב׳, תמורה ט״ז א׳.</span></i> According to another source the Mishna was completed by the Nasi Rabbi Jehudah and by Rabbi Nathan.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פ״ו א׳.</span></i> Rabbi Nathan did leave a book of social, ethical and religious maxims very similar to the book of Aboth and this book is called “Aboth d’Rabbi Nathan”. In the opinion of some, the book Mechilta was collated by the pupils of Rabbi Nathan from the sayings of their teacher who quoted the lectures of his master Rabbi Ishmael
Rabbi Nathan’s system of exposition was to trace every law to the original text and to remove all contradictions. His legal opinions are quoted in the Talmud and are always very penetrating.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא נ״ג א׳.</span></i>
After the death of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel, Rabbi Nathan continued as head of the court of the Sanhedrin during the administration of Rabbi Jehudah despite the fact that he frequently conflicted with him. The Nasi Rabbi Jehudah personally declared that: “I was once childish and brazenly opposed Rabbi Nathan of Babylonia.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא קל״א א׳.</span></i>
Characteristic of Rabbi Nathan’s trend of thoughts are the following social, ethical and religious maxims which he based on the text of the Torah. The verse: “You shall not wrong or oppress a stranger for you were strangers in the land of Egypt” (Ex. 22:20) Rabbi Nathan interpreted that “a man should never accuse others of the fault from which he is suffering”.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא נ״ט ב׳, מסכת גרים פרק ד׳.</span></i>
The Menorah was constructed so that the three lights on either side were inclined toward the central light. This indicates that the one in the center is always the most important one.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מנחות צ״ח ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Nathan opposed vows and he said: “For the sin of making a vow and not fulfilling it, a man is punished by the death of his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ל״ב ב׳.</span></i> Another time he said, “He who makes a vow is like one who builds a Bamah (an altar outside of the temple) and the sin of one who fulfills his vow is like the sin of a man who offers sacrifices on a Bamah.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדרים כ״ב א׳.</span></i>
A man who accepts bribes to pass an unjust sentence will not die before one of the following three calamities will befall him: he will lose his reason, he will become dependent on human charity or the vision of his eyes will be diminished.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכילתא שמות כ״ו.</span></i>
Another saying of Rabbi Nathan gives a clear picture of the conditions of that time: “It is a good omen for a man to receive his punishment immediately after his death by not being buried, by not being mourned, by having his body devoured by animals or by having his body exposed to the rain. All these indicate that the man received his due punishment immediately after his death.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין מ״ז א׳.</span></i>
We have remarked before that Rabbi Nathan travelled through many countries and it was then that he observed the nature of the various nations which he characterized in the following manner:
Nine-tenths of the harlotry in the world is concentrated in Alexandria and the remaining tenth is spread over the rest of the world.
Nine-tenths of the wealth of the world is in Rome and the remaining tenth is scattered throughout the rest of the world.
Nine-tenths of the poverty in the world is concentrated in Lud and the remaining tenth is distributed in the rest of the world.
Nine-tenths of the witchcraft in the world is in Egypt and the remaining tenth in all the other countries.
Nine-tenths of the foolishness in the world is possessed by the Ishmaelites and one-tenth by all other peoples.
Nine-tenths of the filth in the world is possessed by the Persians and the remaining tenth by all other peoples.
The land of Media possesses nine-tenths of the beauty in the world and all the other countries possess but one-tenth.
Nine-tenths of the ugliness in the world is in the East (?) and one-tenth in all other countries.
The Chaldeans possess nine-tenths of the strength in the world and all the other countries possess but one-tenth.
The tribe of Judah possesses nine-tenths of the valor in the world and all the other countries possess the remaining tenth.
The Land of Israel possesses nine-tenths of the wisdom in the world and all other countries possess but one-tenth.
The Jews possess nine-tenths of the Torah (learning) in the world and all the other peoples possess but one-tenth.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין מ״ט ב׳, אסתר רבה פּרשה א׳.</span></i>
Speaking in the same vein on another occasion he said: “There is no greater love than the love of the Torah; there is no greater wisdom than the wisdom of the Land of Israel; there is no greater beauty than the beauty of Jerusalem; there is no greater wealth than the wealth of Rome; there is no greater valor than the valor of the Persians; there is no greater immorality than the immorality of the Arabs; there is no greater rudeness than the rudeness of the land of Elam; there is no greater flattery than the flattery of Babylonia; there is no greater witchcraft than the witchcraft of Egypt.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק כ״ה.</span></i>
The following statements of Rabbi Nathan concerning the creation of the world are also very interesting:
“The whole world is beneath one star. One can see this by looking at a star. If a man walk to the East, the star is above him; if he walk in another direction the star is still over him. During the summer the sun is high in the sky and the whole world is hot but the water from the springs is cold; but during the winter the sun is low in the sky and the whole world is cold but the water from the springs is warm.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים צ״ד ב׳.</span></i>

Rabbi Meir

T<small>HE REMNANT</small> of Rabbi Akiba’s disciples together with those scholars who were ordained by Rabbi Jehudah ben Baba were the main pillars of the Sanhedrin at Usha. Rabbi Meir was one of the most important of these.
Nothing is known of Rabbi Meir’s family; even his name is not known for certain. Some authorities maintain that his real name was not Meir but Nehorai and that he was called Meir because “he illuminated the vision of the scholars with his learning.” Others say that his name was Miasha or that he was identical with Rabbi Elazar ben Arach.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין י״ג ב׳.</span></i> It is interesting to note that the names Meir and Nehorai have the same meaning. Meir is the Hebrew for “one who gives light” and Nehorai is its Aramaeic equivalent. It is also noteworthy that the Talmud cites a dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Nehorai.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין צ״ט א׳.</span></i>
A legend relates that Rabbi Meir was descended from a Roman general who was sent to subdue Palestine and who was converted to Judaism. It is therefore remarkable that despite his uncertain origin Rabbi Meir became the son-in-law of Rabbi Hanina ben Tradion who gave him his brilliant daughter, Beruriah, in marriage.
The first years of Rabbi Meir’s activity must have occurred after the destruction of Betar and before emperor Antoninus Pius alleviated the condition of the Jews. Since Rabbi Meir was a pupil of Elisha ben Avuyah during the time of Hadrian’s decrees against the study of the Torah, it may be assumed that together with other scholars he fled to Babylonia for a time and returned with the accession of Antoninus Pius to the throne of Rome.
At first Rabbi Meir was a pupil of Rabbi Ishmael and later he studied with Rabbi Akiba. He was also a pupil of Elisha ben Avuyah and he maintained a close friendship with a Gentile philosopher Abnimos Hagardi, who was a great friend of the Jewish people and who revered the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה ס״ה ט״ז, ילקוט תולדות קט״ו.</span></i>
Rabbi Meir’s devotion to Elisha ben Avuyah has been described before. His friendship for Abnimos Hagardi was equally great and when the parents of his friend died he visited him and condoled with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מדרש רות פּרשה א׳.</span></i>
It thus becomes evident that Rabbi Meir was interested in the Gentile sciences as well as Jewish learning and he was probably acquainted with the Greek writings of his time. The three daily benedictions which Rabbi Meir instituted (for not being born a Gentile, for not being born a woman and for not being created a boor) he did not receive by tradition from previous scholars but he probably imitated the Greek philosopher Socrates who recited three similar benedictions to his idols. This supposition is further substantiated by his devotion and friendship for Elisha ben Avuyah and Abnimos Hagardi. It is impossible to think that these two did not acquaint him with Greek literature or that Greek letters should have made no impression upon him even where they did not conflict with the tenets of Jewish religion. This influence is also evident from his statement that “just as a judge covers his face with a veil even so did the generation of the deluge believe that God covered his face with clouds.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ל״ו פּיסקא א׳.</span></i> Saying this Rabbi Meir must have had in mind the Greek goddess of justice (Themida) who is pictured with eyes covered.
All of Rabbi Meir’s statements were concise and short and were interwoven with fables from which he deduced legal opinions as well as he used them to illustrate legends.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ל״ח ב׳.</span></i> When Rabbi Meir died it was said that the mastery of fable has departed.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה מ״ט א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Meir’s first public appearance resulted in a conflict of opinions. A meeting was held at that time in the valley of Rimon to determine the question of the leap year because the calculations of the calendar were confused. Rabbi Jochanan the Sandal-maker opposed the calculations of Rabbi Meir and when the latter insisted on his opinion and quoted Rabbi Akiba, Rabbi Jochanan said to him, “I have always served Rabbi Akiba as a disciple while you were only one of the audience.” Rabbi Jochanan implied that he was better informed of the opinions of Rabbi Akiba but Rabbi Meir replied to him, “You are only an Alexandrian”. (The term Alexandrian suggested a person who was limited in his understanding of the words of his master.)
This clash, however, did not engender any hatred between the scholars for they all realized that peace was essential at that time for the observance of the commandments of the Torah. Therefore none of those gathered departed until peace was restored between the disputants.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי חגיגה פרק ג׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> Only much later did a sharp conflict take place between Rabbi Meir and the Nasi, Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel, which ended with Rabbi Meir’s departure from Palestine to settle in a city of Asia Minor.
Some of Rabbi Meir’s statements definitely show the influence of his contact with Elisha ben Avuyah and Abnimos Hagardi. Thus when he said that “even a Gentile who devotes himself to the Torah is like a High Priest”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא ל״ח א׳.</span></i> he probably had in mind his friend Abnimos; and when he said that “all Jews are God’s children when they behave like children as well as when they misbehave”<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ל״ו א׳.</span></i> he no doubt thought of Elisha ben Avuyah.
Rabbi Meir considered learning to be the most important thing in life. A man must always devote more time to learning than to worldly affairs, he said, and whoever devotes himself to learning for its own sake attains various stages of perfection and he is justified in believing that the world was created for his sake. Such a person is beloved of God and men, people are pleased with him as well as God; he is modest and pious, just and devoted, he refrains from sin and his advice is sought, for the Torah confers on one the understanding of its mysteries.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אָבות פרק ו׳ משנה א׳.</span></i>
When the inhabitants of the city of Sephoris disapproved of his custom of greeting mourners on the Sabbath, because he believed that the Sabbath was not a day of mourning, Rabbi Jose ben Chalafta, Rabbi Meir’s friend, defended him and said that he was “a great man, a holy and a modest man”.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ב׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i> Still greater praise of Rabbi Meir was expressed by Rabina who said that whoever saw Rabbi Meir in the academy could imagine seeing him pull up the largest mountains and crushing them one against the other for then a person could gain knowledge even from Rabbi Meir’s cane.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין כ״ד א׳, ירושלמי נדרים פרק ט׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Meir was attached to Palestine by the bonds of deep love and he spoke with great enthusiasm of the Hebrew language. He greatly treasured these two national assets and declared that whoever settles in the Land of Israel and speaks the Hebrew language is certain to deserve a share in the world to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שבת פרק א׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i> He was also a master of legal argumentation and later generations admitted that in his day there was none to equal him. But his legal opinions were frequently rejected because his intent could not be fathomed. Applying pilpulistic reasoning he could prove that which everybody held to be clean as unclean and vice versa.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין י״ג ב׳.</span></i>
An anecdote was therefore current at that time that Rabah bar Shilo once met the prophet Elijah and asked him what God was doing. Elijah replied that God was pondering the words of all the scholars except those of Rabbi Meir, because he was a pupil of “Acher”.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה ט״ו ב׳.</span></i>
It is necessary to remark, however, that Rabbi Meir never tried to lighten the burden of the law in order that people may not say that he allows liberties to be taken with the law because of his knowledge of secular sciences. He was therefore strict in his interpretation as, for instance, when he ruled that a Kethuba (marriage certificate) which promises less than two hundred dinars for a virgin or less than one hundred dinars for a widow is not valid,<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות מ״ח ב׳.</span></i> or that a bill of divorce which differs even by one word from the form prescribed is invalid and any children which the woman may have by a subsequent marriage are illegitimate.<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ה׳ ב׳.</span></i>
He frequently brought up for discussion legal situations which may occur only very rarely or never at all. In doing so Rabbi Meir tried to provide complicated exercises for his pupils as, for example, in the problem which he posed before them about the possible case of a man who had two groups of daughters from two wives and one of the daughters was married but he did not know whether it was the oldest of the first group or the oldest of the second, or possibly the youngest of the older group who was older than the oldest of the younger group.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ס״ד ב׳.</span></i> Another time he suggested the problem of an ox belonging to a deaf person, a foolish man or a minor which gored the ox belonging to an intelligent man.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא ל״ט א׳.</span></i> The following was another example of this type of questions: the law forbids to slaughter an animal and its offspring on the same day; but a man who slaughtered an animal and its third generation offspring has broken no law. If however this person proceeds to slaughter the daughter of the old animal (and the mother of the young) he breaks the law twice but he is to be punished only once.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין פּ״ב א׳.</span></i>
When Rabbi Meir died, his colleague, Rabbi Jehudah bar Elai, asked that his disciples should no longer be admitted to the academy because of their attitude of spite; they came not to learn but to ask perplexing questions which could not be answered.<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין נ״ב ב׳.</span></i>
It would be difficult to list here all of Rabbi Meir’s legal opinions since the Mishna alone contains over 300 laws which bear his name. In addition it is traditionally accepted that all laws whose authorship is not mentioned are generally those of Rabbi Meir. We are more concerned here with his ethical maxims which reflect a great love for the Jewish people, the Torah and the Land of Israel. Of special interest are his ideas about death.
Death was not considered as an uncommon and cruel phenomenon during the time of Rabbi Meir. The constant wars and the bloody persecution of the Jews hardened the people to consider death with indifference. If a man lost his life for his observance of Judaism, his relatives were comforted by the belief that he had sacrificed himself for the sake of God, Rabbi Meir probably witnessed the death of Rabbi Akiba as well as the execution of many others. Later he witnessed the death of his father-in-law, Rabbi Hanina ben Teradion. Rabbi Meir therefore evolved a philosophic outlook on death and he frequently turned to the book of Job. Rabbi Jochanan relates that every time that Rabbi Meir finished reading of that book he would say: “The end of a man is death; the end of animals is slaughter; everything in the world is doomed to die. Happy is he who is raised in the knowledge of the Torah and who strives for it thus causing satisfaction for his Creator. Such a man prospers in his good name and he leaves the world in good repute as king Solomon said: a good name is better than fragrant oil and the day of death is better than the day of birth.”<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות י״ז א׳.</span></i>
The same idea lies at the root of his statement that the Biblical description of the creation of the world which ends in saying that God saw all that He created and that it was “very good” implies that death is “very good”. After the creation of the world God was satisfied with its growth and development as well as with the death of its inhabitants.<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">It may be assumed that Rabbi Meir possessed a Bible which substituted the words <span dir="rtl">טוב מאות</span> instead of <span dir="rtl">טוב מאד</span> as well as <span dir="rtl">כתנות אור</span> instead of <span dir="rtl">כתנות עור</span> Some commentators cannot imagine that Rabbi Meir should have used a faulty text and they maintain that the text was correct and these differing versions must have been inscribed on the margin. Others say that Rabbi Meir’s Bible contained these changes in the text but that for purposes of exposition he used a standard text.</i>
Rabbi Meir’s attitude toward an “Am Haaretz” was unusual. It is told that he always rose at the sight of an old man even if the man was an “Am Haaretz”. When he was asked why he accords such honor to an old “Am Haaretz”, he replied, that if God chose such a man to grant him many years of life, he must have deserved it and he therefore also deserved that people should accord him honor.<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי בכורים פרק ג׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
But despite the honor which he accorded them, Rabbi Meir felt an instinctive hatred of the “Am Haaretz” and he said, “When a man marries his daughter to an ‘Am Haaretz’ it is as if he bound her and placed her in front of a lion who steps on his victim with his paws before devouring him. An ‘Am Haretz’ may also beat his wife and love her at the same time without shame”.<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים מ״ט ב׳.</span></i> Another time he expressed his hatred of an “Am Haaretz” in even sharper terms when he said that “one who allows an ‘Am Haaretz’ to sleep in his house and finds him awake when he enters the house, must consider the house to be unclean”.<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">טהרות פרק ז׳ משנה ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Meir’s social orientation may be gleaned from his statement that a bill of debt which includes a clause about interest is invalid and even the principal may not be collected.<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא ז׳ ב׳, בבא בתרא ע״ב א׳.</span></i> The charging of interest he considered to be on a par with robbery and the repentance of a man who had committed robbery would never be accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בכורות ל״א א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Meir studied with three masters (Rabbi Ishmael, Rabbi Akiba and Elisha-Acher) and of this he said: “A man who learns the Torah from one master may be compared to a person who owns one field, part of which is sown to wheat, part to barley, another part is planted with olives and the remainder with other trees. Such a man will see no blessing in his field. But one who learned from two or more masters may be compared to a person who owns several fields, one of which is sown to wheat and another to barley, one is planted with olive trees and another field is planted with other kinds of trees. Such a man will find blessing in his fields.<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק ח׳ .</span></i>
Rabbi Meir’s wife was the daughter of Rabbi Hanina ben Tradion. He had two sons, both of whom suddenly died on a Saturday afternoon, and one daughter who was married to a scholar named Zivtai. He derived no income from his scholastic work and he obtained his sustenance as a copyist. By doing this work he earned three ducats a week, one of which he spent for food for his household; one he spent for clothes and the third one he distributed to the needy scholars. When he was asked what he was doing to assure the future of his children, Rabbi Meir replied: “If my children will be just men, God will provide them with their needs according to the verse that there was never a just man seen whose children should be forced to beg for bread. But if they will not be just men, why should I leave money for the enemies of God?”<sup class="footnote-marker">30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קהלת רבה פּרשה ב׳ פּיסקא כ״ב.</span></i>
In the matter of the observance of Judaism Rabbi Meir would tolerate no compromises; if he suspected a man of breaking even the slightest commandment, that man was already suspected in his eyes of breaking all the commandments of the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין מ״ט א׳, בכורות ל׳ א׳.</span></i> This attitude was parallel to the accepted rule that a false witness who gave untrue testimony was capable of committing every sin mentioned in the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">32)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין כ״ז א׳.</span></i>
Every man should teach his son a clean and easy trade but at the same time he must pray to God for a livelihood for there is no trade but that some who are engaged in it are rich while others are poor. Poverty and wealth are not the result of following a certain trade but every man obtains that which he merits.<sup class="footnote-marker">33)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין פּ״ב א׳.</span></i> A man may gain his livelihood by doing any kind of work but happy is the man who sees his parents doing noble work and woe to him who sees his parents engaged in low work.<sup class="footnote-marker">34)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי קדושין פרק ד׳ הלכה י״א.</span></i>
Concerning prayer Rabbi Meir said that one must not speak too much when praying to God<sup class="footnote-marker">35)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ס״א ב׳.</span></i> and that it is necessary to praise God for the evil as well as for the good.<sup class="footnote-marker">36)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות מ״ח ב׳.</span></i> Above all is the significance of repentance which may cause God to forgive the sins of the whole world because of the repentance of an individual.<sup class="footnote-marker">37)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא פ״ו ב׳.</span></i>
In interpreting the text of the Bible Rabbi Meir often used fables. He thus pointed out that the prophet Obadia was an Idumean proselyte and that his prophecy foretold the downfall of Idumea. This he compared to an ax which tries to chop down a forest but cannot do so until it first obtains a handle from the trees of the forest.<sup class="footnote-marker">38)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ל״ט ב׳.</span></i>
The tree of knowledge of which Adam ate, Rabbi Meir declared to be a wheat plant (!) and a foolish man may be said never to have eaten bread made of wheat.<sup class="footnote-marker">39)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ט״ו פּיסקא ה׳.</span></i> When one comes to a strange city he should follow the customs of that city. When Moses ascended to Heaven he neither ate nor drank but when the angels descended to earth they consumed food.<sup class="footnote-marker">40)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה מ״ח פּיסקא ט״ז.</span></i>
Rabbi Meir’s opinions regarding relations between man and wife illustrate that it was very difficult at that time to preserve the women from the Roman soldiers, who evidently considered them as their possession. Rabbi Meir said: “Just as there are different tastes regarding food even so there exist different attitudes to women. One man will throw out the fly which falls into his beaker but will drink no more of it while another man will cast out the fly from his beaker and will continue to drink from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">41)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין צ׳ א׳, תוספתא סוטה פרק ה׳.</span></i>
Whenever Rabbi Meir saw a man leaving on a journey he would say: “Go in peace, you who are doomed to death”. Due to the insecurity of the highways at that time it could be assumed that any man going on a trip was sure not to return alive; and when he saw two people going on a journey he would say: “Go in peace, men of discord”, for he was certain that when two people travel together they are bound to quarrel. But when Rabbi Meir saw three people going on a journey he would say, “Go in peace, oh children of peace,” because he felt certain that if two of them were to quarrel, the third one would reconcile them.<sup class="footnote-marker">42)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קהלת רבה פּרשה ד׳ פּיסקא י״ד.</span></i>
With the death of Rabbi Meir, his contemporaries claimed that a definite type of person had died out. Rabbi Tarphon was said to have been the tallest man of his generation and Rabbi Meir only reached up to his shoulder. After Rabbi Tarphon died, Rabbi Meir remained the tallest man of his generation and the Nasi, Rabbi Jehudah, only reached to his shoulder.<sup class="footnote-marker">43)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדה כ׳׳ד ב׳.</span></i>
All of Rabbi Meir’s days were one long series of uncommon afflictions and suffering. Together with the other Jews of his time he had to bear the burden of persecutions which he probably felt more keenly than the others. This may be gathered from his story that when he was attending the academy of Rabbi Akiba, everybody recited the Shema in such low tones that they could not hear their own murmuring for fear that the military guard who was stationed at the door to watch all their movements may hear them pray. It would seem that the study of the Torah was not entirely forbidden at that time but that the reciting of the Shema was prohibited.<sup class="footnote-marker">44)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספתא ברכות פרק ב׳.</span></i>
But incomparison with the suffering that followed, the early difficulties seemed no more than child’s play. Rabbi Meir had to witness the terrible death of Rabbi Akiba when his flesh was torn with iron combs; later he saw his father-in-law, Rabbi Chanina ben Teradion, burned at the stake, his mother-in-law executed and his sister-in-law sent away to a house of ill repute for the gratification of the Roman officials.
Rabbi Meir was known for his modesty toward women and he frequently scorned those who succumbed to their passions. He said that human intelligence should be able to control all passions; nevertheless he once had an experience of which he was later very much ashamed. Walking along the bank of a river, the Evil one appeared before him in the guise of a beautiful woman on the other shore of the stream who tempted him so luringly that he lost all control of himself and decided to cross to the other side of the river. But no boat was available and there was only a board floating in the middle of the stream. Picking up a rope which he found on the shore, he tried to reach the board and when his attempt was unsuccessful he waded in the water trying to reach the board. But the woman on the other side of the stream meanwhile vanished and he returned to the shore shamefaced at having succumbed to the vision.<sup class="footnote-marker">45)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין פּ״א א׳.</span></i>
Beruriah, the wife of Rabbi Meir and the daughter of Rabbi Chanina ben Teradion, was the only woman ever mentioned in the Talmud for her scholarship and learned men respectfully listened to her opinions on legal as well as secular matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">46)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים ס״ב ב׳.</span></i> When Rabbi Jose of Galilee once asked her opinion in some matter she made fun of him for speaking lengthily and thus breaking the commandment of the scholars not to speak too much with a woman. She is also said to have complained against a pupil of her father who studied very quietly and she said that only when one studies aloud can he understand his learning.<sup class="footnote-marker">47)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין נ״ג ב׳.</span></i> She was the spiritual support of Rabbi Meir and comforted him in time of need. It is thus related that Rabbi Meir once lived in the neighborhood of a group of rude people who plagued him greatly and he cursed them. His wife chided him for cursing them and said that one should never condemn sinful people but rather condemn their sins. Rabbi Meir began to pray to God to reform these people and his prayer was granted.<sup class="footnote-marker">48)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות י׳ א׳.</span></i>
Like her husband Beruriah also felt confident of her will power and scorned those who said that women were light minded. Rabbi Meir warned her against this attitude saying that some day she may prove this rule but she insisted that no woman who held fast to her opinions need be led astray. Rabbi Meir then persuaded one of his pupils to attempt to seduce her; he was certain that his pupil would not go further than the attempt and he could then prove to his wife the truth of the opinion of the scholars regarding women when they said that even an educated woman could be led astray. But Rabbi Meir’s disciple betrayed him and when Beruriah found out that the affair had been planned beforehand she hanged herself out of chagrin.
We have previously mentioned that Beruriah’s sister was condemned to be sent to a house of ill repute that was located in Antioch where lived the officials of the Roman administration of Palestine. Beruriah begged Rabbi Meir to try to save her sister and he went to Antioch, dressed as a Roman noble in order to deceive the guard of the house as well as his sister-in-law as to his identity. Legend recounts many wonders which occurred during this attempt. When he was convinced that Beruriah’s sister preserved her purity he took a measure of gold and offered it to the guard to release her. He told the guard to keep half of the gold and to use the other half to bribe the officials if he was to be caught. The guard feared that money would be of no avail if he was caught and Rabbi Meir advised him to pronounce the words: “God of Meir, save me!” and he would certainly be saved.
The guard still refused to believe that these words would help him when in danger and Rabbi Meir proved this to him. About that house there were savage, man eating, dogs and Rabbi Meir began to tease them. The dogs pounced upon him ready to devour him and he exclaimed, “God of Meir, answer me!” and the dogs immediately left him in peace. Seeing this the guard was convinced that he could safely accept the bribe.
When the guard was finally caught and sentenced to be crucified he pronounced these words and was saved. The executioners marvelled at this and asked him what incantation he knew that could save him from the cross and he told them everything that he knew. They then began to search for Rabbi Meir and they engraved his image on the gates of Rome (more probably Antioch) and issued a commandment that whoever will recognize the man who resembled the likeness of the image should seize him and bring him before the imperial authorities. One day Rabbi Meir was recognized and an attempt was made to seize him.
There exist numerous versions concerning the manner in which he escaped his pursuers. One version states that he fled into a house of ill repute and his pursuers were convinced that they were mistaken and that it could not have been Rabbi Meir for he would not enter such a house. Another version relates that in his flight he came upon a pot of unclean food; he then placed his finger in it and ate some of it. Obviously he did not put into his mouth the finger which he inserted into the unclean food, but from a distance, his pursuers could not distinguish what he did and they felt certain that it was not Rabbi Meir that they were following. Another version relates that the prophet Elijah appeared in the guise of a harlot and embraced Rabbi Meir and thus deceived his pursuers as to his identity.<sup class="footnote-marker">49)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה י״ח א׳—ב׳.</span></i>
On one of his journeys Rabbi Meir spent a night in a hostelry and he saw that the proprietor woke the guests at night and told them to proceed on their way. The proprietor then escorted each of the guests part of the way. Rabbi Meir understood that the proprietor was in league with a band of robbers and when his turn came he said that he could not go because he was waiting for his brother to accompany him. The proprietor of the hostelry asked Rabbi Meir what the name of his brother was and where he lodged and Rabbi Meir answered him that his name was <span dir="rtl">כי טוב״</span>„ and that he lodged in the synagogue. The man then stood all night in front of the synagogue calling: “It is good, come out; your brother is waiting for you,” but no one came out and he received no answer.
In the morning Rabbi Meir was ready to leave and the inn keeper said to him: “Where is your brother? Why don’t you wait for him?” Rabbi Meir replied: “The light of day is my brother for so the Bible says that the light of day is good, and this verse was in a book of the Bible in the synagogue all night.”<sup class="footnote-marker">50)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה צ״ב פּיסקא ו׳.</span></i>
Beruriah, Rabbi Meir’s wife, exerted a great influence over him and it is therefore interesting to relate how she informed him of the sudden death of their two sons. It happened on a Sabbath before sunset when Rabbi Meir was in the academy engaged in his studies that his sons suddenly died. Legend does not mention the cause of their death. Beruriah placed the bodies of her sons on the bed and covered them with a sheet without saying a word to anyone. When Rabbi Meir returned to his house he immediately asked where his sons were and she replied that they were probably in the academy. He was surprised and said: “I have looked everywhere in the academy but I did not see them.”
Somewhat later he asked for his sons again and she replied that they probably tarried in conversation on the way home and would soon return. Then Beruriah turned to Rabbi Meir with the following question: “I was once given a valuable treasure to guard until it would be called for. Today the man came to claim his treasure; should I return it?” Rabbi Meir at once replied: “Of course you must return that which was given to you to guard. I do not understand why you have to ask me such a question.” Beruriah then took Rabbi Meir by the hand and led him to the bed where their dead sons lay and she said: “This is the treasure which God gave me to guard and today he claimed it.” Rabbi Meir began to weep bitterly but she said to him, “Did you not say that it was necessary to return a treasure which was given to one to guard?”<sup class="footnote-marker">51)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מדרש משלי פּרשה ל״א.</span></i>
Wonderful stories are told of Rabbi Meir’s modesty. One of these is very similar to the one told about Baba ben Zuta of how a woman threw a candlestick at him at the command of her husband.
The story concerning Rabbi Meir relates that there was a woman who loved to hear his lectures and on a certain Sabbath she tarried long in the academy listening to him. When she returned home late, her husband expelled her from the house and threatened to divorce her if she would not spit in Rabbi Meir’s face. When Rabbi Meir heard of this he summoned the woman and said to her: “I have an ailing eye and the doctor said that if a woman were to spit in it seven times it would be healed.” At first the woman refused to do as Rabbi Meir asked her but when he insisted, she was persuaded and did as she was asked. Rabbi Meir then said to her: “Go and tell your husband that not once but seven times you spit in Rabbi Meir’s eye.<sup class="footnote-marker">52)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי סוטה פרק א׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>

Rabbi Jehudah bar Elai

W<small>HEN THE</small> scholars gathered in Usha, they honored the outstanding man of that city, Rabbi Jehuda bar Elai. At that gathering he spoke of the various customs and commandments which were nearly forgotten during the days of Hadrian and he gained the appelation “The first speaker on every occasion”. This name was associated with Rabbi Jehudah all the days of his life. Various sources indicate that he was the only scholar of that time whose opinions concerning Halacha, Hagada and the contemporary problems of life were listened to with respect. Nearly three thousand statements of Rabbi Jehudah are quoted in the Mishna, Boraitha, Tosephta, Safra, Sifri and Mechilta. All statements, credited to Rabbi Jehudah without any further designation, are the statements of Rabbi Jehudah bar Elai.
The statements of Rabbi Jehudah concerning accepted laws quoted the opinions of his teachers, or traditional interpretations which they received from their predecessors, as it was customary at that time to quote opinions of authorities dating back before the destruction of the Temple.
Rabbi Elai, the father of Rabbi Jehudah, was a Tana of the Mishna and a contemporary of Rabban Gamliel of Jabneh.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין כ״ג א׳, ס״ד ב׳.</span></i> He was a disciple of Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מנחות י״ח א׳, פּסחים ל״ט א׳, סוכה כ״ז ב׳.</span></i> and of Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ו׳ ב׳.</span></i> Rabbi Elai was the first teacher of his son Jehudah; later he sent him to the academy in Jabneh to receive instruction from the same men that he had studied with in his youth. Rabbi Jehudah studied with Rabbi Akiba and even more with Rabbi Tarphon. He thus accumulated a large volume of information which he later quoted in the name of his masters.
Rabbi Jehudah was an opponent of Rabbi Meir. This opposition was so strong that after the death of Rabbi Meir Rabbi Jehudah asked that the disciples of the former should not be admitted to the academy because “they are spiteful and they come not to learn but to ask questions which cannot be answered”.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין נ״ב ב׳.</span></i>
The following was a favorite maxim of Rabbi Jehudah: “Be cautious in learning for error may lead to sin.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק ד׳ משנה י״ג.</span></i> This maxim he further elaborated and said: “The errors of a scholar are considered as intentional sin while the intentional sin of an Am Haaretz is considered as an unconscious transgression.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא ל״ג ב׳.</span></i> He also said: “He who makes the Torah the outstanding purpose of his life and relegates his worldly occupations to a secondary position will come to be considered by the world as of importance; but a man who makes his worldly occupations the central motive of his life and relegates the Torah to a secondary place will himself come to be considered as of no importance. It is like choosing between two highways, one of which is made of fire while the other is covered with snow. If one goes on the fiery road he may be burned and if he goes on the snowy road he may be frozen. It is therefore necessary to follow a middle course and to beware of the heat of the fire and of the frost of the snow.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק כ״ח, תוספתא חגיגה פרק ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jehudah highly valued the worth of labor and he said that it honors those that engage in it.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדרים מ״ט ב׳.</span></i> Among the duties of a father toward his son he also included that of teaching him a trade and he added that “one who does not teach his son a trade may be compared to a person who teaches his son to be a robber.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין כ״ט א׳, תוספתא קדושין פרק א׳.</span></i> But despite his attitude toward labor he still ascribed the highest importance to learning and he said: “Previous generations definitely established the time to be devoted to learning but the time to be devoted to their occupations and their personal interests was left undetermined. They therefore found time for both. But later generations determined the time for their labors and did not definitely establish the time to be devoted to learning. They therefore found time for neither.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ל״׳ה ב׳.</span></i>
When the question was discussed whether it was more important to study the commandments or to practice them Rabbi Jehudah said that the fulfillment of the commandments was of greater significance than learning and when he saw that a dead person had to be buried or a bride had to be led to the canopy, he commanded his disciples to interrupt their studies and to attend the funeral or the wedding.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות י״ז א׳, ירושלמי חגיגה פרק א׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jehudah learned most from Rabbi Tarphon and he frequently related things which he had learned from him. Thus he told of the occasion when, as a small boy, he read the Megillah in the presence of Rabbi Tarphon and of other scholars<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה כ׳ א׳.</span></i> or the various customs which Rabbi Tarphon saw him performing during the lighting of the candles or in the matter of removing objects out of a house through a window on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת כ״ט ב׳, ירזשלמי סוטה פרק ב׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>
We have mentioned before that Rabbi Jehudah bar Elai was “the first to speak” in Usha because he was a native of that city. This position he maintained also after the Sanhedrin returned to Jabneh for a short time as a result of Rabbi Jehudah’s friendly attitude toward Rome.
The manner in which his attitude became known to the Romans is related in the following story. Rabbi Jehudah, Rabbi Jose ben Chalafta and Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai once sat in the academy together with Rabbi Jehudah ben Gerim. A discussion developed regarding the achievements of the Romans in Palestine and Rabbi Jehudah bar Elai praised the Romans for paving highways and building baths and bridges. Rabbi Jose ben Chalafta heard these praises and remained silent. He did not agree with Rabbi Jehudah but he was afraid to contradict him. Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai then could not control himself and he said: “What is there to praise? Whatever the Romans did, they did for their own benefit. They paved streets in order to settle their harlots there; they built bath houses in order to anoint themselves; they built bridges in order to collect tolls.”
Unintentionally perhaps, Rabbi Jehudah ben Gerim repeated these words in the presence of others and the Roman authorities finally heard of the discussion and were greatly displeased with it. They commanded that Rabbi Jehudah bar Elai, who praised the Roman achievements should be honored. Rabbi Jose ben Chalafta, who remained silent and did not express his agreement with Rabbi Jehudah, they interned in his native city of Sephoris and he was forbidden to leave it. Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai, who denounced the Romans, was condemned to death.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ל״ג ב׳.</span></i>
The elevation of Rabbi Jehudah consisted in that be continued as the head speaker and he later became a tutor in the house of the Nasi. It must be borne in mind that although the decrees against the Jews were abrogated, the Roman government still looked unfavorably on the Dynasty of the Nasi which was derived from the royal house of David and government circles understood that the Jews did not consider themselves as subjects of Rome but looked up to the Nasi as to their God anointed ruler. But the Romans had great confidence in Rabbi Jehudah bar Elai and they overlooked the royal honors which the Jews accorded to the Nasi. The Roman attitude was one of toleration and they allowed the Jews to “play” with a Nasi as long as they paid their taxes regularly.
Despite Rabbi Jehudah’s prominence among the Jews and his favorable position among the Romans he suffered great poverty. His wife was always dressed in old woolen garments and they had only one heavy coat. When Rabbi Jehudah had to go into the street he put it on and when his wife had to go to market she wore it. Poverty was very common at that time and it was told that six people had to share the same blanket.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין כ׳ א׳.</span></i> Many people wanted to aid Rabbi Jehudah but he refused all assistance and once, when the Nasi declared a fast day and Rabbi Jehudah failed to appear at the prayers following the fast because he had no garment to wear, the Nasi sent him some garments, but even these he refused.
But Rabbi Jehudah’s face never betrayed his poverty. It is related that he once sat before Rabbi Tarphon and the latter said to him: “You appear to be merry today.” Rabbi Jehudah replied: “Your slaves went into the field today and they brought me some greens which I ate without salt. This is the reason why I am merry. You may also imagine how much better I would feel if I had some salt to eat with the greens.”
Another time a Roman matron said to him: “You are a scholar but you look like a person who is drunk.” Rabbi Jehudah replied, “I swear by my faith that I drink no wine except for Kidush and Havdalah; when I drink the prescribed four glasses of wine on the Passover I suffer from headaches until Shavuoth.” A Sadducee who met Rabbi Jehudah said to him, “You look like a usurer or like a swineherd.” But Rabbi Jehudah answered, “I am a Jew and therefore I can be neither.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדרים מ״ט ב׳.</span></i>
From that which has been related so far we may conclude that Rabbi Jehudah was a man of modesty and of extreme piety.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות י״ז א׳, בבא קמא ק״ג ב׳.</span></i> He said, “Better eat an onion and sit in the shade and refrain from eating geese and hens and your heart will not palpitate. It is better still to eat less and to drink less in order to live better.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים קי״ד א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jehudah’s attitude toward the political situation of the Jews is expressed in his statement regarding the Biblical verse which sometimes compares the Jews to the dust and other time to the stars. When the Jews fall, he said, they fall as low as the dust but when they are elevated, they are raised to the stars.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה ט״ז א׳.</span></i>
Like some other Tanaim Rabbi Jehudah was ready to overlook his own dignity when peace between husband and wife was at stake. Thus it happened that a man once vowed not to taste of his wife’s cooking until Rabbi Jehudah would first partake of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדרים ס״ו ב׳.</span></i>
The following expressions of Rabbi Jehudah are also characteristic of his trend of thoughts:
“Do you want to know what man is worthy to speak to God for his congregation when a fast has been declared to avert a calamity? Such a man must have many children and must not have enough food for them; he must be a hard worker and his house must be empty, in addition he must have a fine voice and a good diction. He must be modest and beloved of the people. He must know the Scriptures, the Mishna, Halacha and Hagada as well as all the benediction.”<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית ט״ז א׳.</span></i>
“When a man is sick with croup it generally begins with the intestines and it ends with his mouth. Even so is the development of sin: the kidneys mislead, the heart understands, the tongue speaks and the mouth ends it all.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ל״ג ב׳.</span></i>
“Charity is a great virtue and it brings redemption nearer. God created ten kinds of strength each of which is stronger than the preceding one and acts as a cure for it. A mountain is strong but iron cuts it; iron is strong but fire melts it; fire is strong but water puts it out; water is strong but the clouds carry it away; clouds are strong but the wind disperses them; wind is strong but the human body withstands it; the human body is strong but fear breaks it; fear is strong but wine dispels it; wine is strong but sleep does away with its effects. The strongest of all is death but charity saves one from death.”<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא י׳ א׳.</span></i>

Rabbi Jose ben Chalafta

R<small>ABBI</small> J<small>OSE BEN</small> C<small>HALAFTA</small> was one of the outstanding disciples that survived Rabbi Akiba. Together with a group of others he was ordained by Rabbi Jehudah ben Baba in the mountains between Usha and Shefarom, when the Roman government forbade ordination. Rabbi Jehudah ben Baba paid with his life for this act.
Rabbi Jose was said to have been descended from an aristocratic line. When a list of genealogies was found in Jerusalem, Rabbi Jose traced his descent from Jehonadab ben Recheb<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי תענית פרק ד׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i> who aided Jehu, the king of Israel, to destroy the house of Ahab and to eradicate idolatry from among the ten tribes. It may be assumed that Rabbi Jose’s grandfather came to Palestine from Babylonia and his racial purity was therefore unquestioned. Rabbi Jose was very proud of this and he said: “All lands are as sour dough when compared to the Land of Israel, but the Land of Israel is as sour dough when compared to Babylonia”.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ע״א א׳.</span></i> In saying this Rabbi Jose implied that the purity of the race was better preserved in Babylonia than in Palestine, where the immorality of the Romans influenced the general behavior.
Rabbi Chalafta, Jose’s father, was one of the most prominent people in the period preceding the decrees of Hadrian. It seems probable that he was head of the court in Sephoris which was located eighteen miles from Tiberias.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית ט״ז ב׳.</span></i> Rabbi Jose told that his father saw Rabban Gamliel the Elder before the destruction of the Temple. His father was also Rabbi Jose’s first teacher and he frequently quoted laws in his name.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כלאים פרק כ״ו משנה ו׳, בבא קמא ע׳ א׳, בכורות כ״ו א׳.</span></i>
Once the question arose whether it was permissible to use a Greek translation of the Scriptures and Rabbi Jose related that his father once came to the house of Rabban Gamliel II and he found him perusing a Greek translation of the book of Job; he then said to him, “I remember seeing your grandfather, Rabban Gamliel the Old, standing on the stairs of the temple and he was given a Greek version of the book of Job. He then commanded the master of the builders to put the book into the walls of the temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קט״ו א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jose followed the method of Rabbi Akiba in his legal opinions,<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כלאים ז׳ ה׳, תרומות ד׳ י״ג, תוספתא פּרה פרק ד׳.</span></i> because he was a disciple of Rabbi Akiba but at various times he also was a pupil of Rabban Gamliel II, Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah, Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha, Rabbi Tarphon and Rabbi Jochanan ben Nuri. For a time he also studied with Abtolemos who was a Tana of the period of the creation of the Mishna and whose name is mentioned only three times.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין ל״ו א׳.</span></i>
Together with the other scholars who survived the persecutions of Hadrian, Rabbi Jose witnessed the afflictions which were visited upon the Jews of Palestine after the execution of many of the outstanding leaders of the people. He witnessed the destruction of his native city Sephoris. After the city was restored he told that the destroyed city contained 180 thousand markets (!) where cooking utensils were sold exclusively.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא ע״ה ב׳.</span></i>
After the death of Rabbi Akiba all the academies were closed until the death of Hadrian brought a respite from the decrees. It was at this time that the famous discussion concerning the achievements of the Romans took place, and Rabbi Jose, who was present at the discussion, remained silent or expressed his disapproval with a gesture and was interned in his native city of Sephoris. During the time of his stay the city was rebuilt and he became its representative. It also appears that at a later date the decree against Rabbi Jose was annulled and he was again free to participate in the deliberations of the Sanhedrin.
Both the Nasi Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel the second as well as his son Jehudah established all laws according to the decision of Rabbi Jose ben Chalafta. This was especially true when other scholars disputed Rabbi Jose’s contentions. When the Nasi Rabbi Jehudah was asked why the law is always enacted according to the opinion of Rabbi Jose he replied: “Just as the distance between the most holy and the ordinary is great even so is there a great difference between our generation and the generation of Rabbi Jose.” Rabbi Ishmael, the son of Rabbi Jose, expressed himself in a similar vein when he declared: “The difference between our generation and the generation of my father is as great as the difference between dust and gold.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי גטין פרק ו׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i>
The arguments of Rabbi Jose are referred to as “Nimukim”, deeply considered convictions.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ס״ז א׳.</span></i> His method was to eliminate all disputes and to explain all contradictions.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תרומות פרק י׳ משנה ג׳, ערובין פּ״ו ב׳.</span></i> The opinion prevailed that Rabbi Jose was an unusually pious and guarded man. It was therefore unbelievable when the rumor was circulated that he once secretly performed ablutions on the Day of Atonement.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ג׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>
The Talmud relates that the prophet Elijah frequently appeared to Rabbi Jose and spoke to him as man to man.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ג׳ ב׳, יבמות ס״ג א׳, סנהדרין קי״ג א׳.</span></i> Rabbi Jose nevertheless allowed himself to make a statement which contradicted the basic tenets of the faith. He said that “the <span dir="rtl">שכינה</span> (the majesty of God) never descended to earth and Moses and the prophet Elijah never ascended heaven”.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוכה ה׳ א׳, מכילתא פּ׳ יתרו.</span></i> The Talmud attempted to explain the words of Rabbi Jose which were in direct contradiction to the text concerning the granting of the Torah and the ascension of Elijah. It was then said that the “Shechinah” never descended lower than ten “handsbreadths” <span dir="rtl">טפחים</span> above ground and that Moses and Elijah never ascended higher than ten “handbreadths” above the ground. In contradiction to the accepted belief that God judges the world four times a year Rabbi Jose maintained that He judges humanity every day.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה ט״ו א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jose’s modesty was a subject of admiration long after he died and everyone was convinced that considering his reverence for the authorities that preceded him it could be assumed that despite his age and his superior scholarship he would have respected the Nasi Rabbi Jehudah as his master had he lived.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת נ״א א׳.</span></i> This conviction was reenforced by the fact that Rabbi Jose always spoke with the greatest respect of his colleagues.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ט׳ א׳, תוספתא פאה פרק ח׳.</span></i> Of himself Rabbi Jose said that he never rescinded his word nor did he ever do otherwise than the scholars commanded.<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ח א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jose gained his livelihood by tanning animal skins. According to the concepts of that time, this occupation was considered as a low type of work.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שבת פרק ד׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>
From numerous statements in the Talmud we may conclude that Rabbi Jose was versed in the natural sciences. He described numerous strange animals which the laws mentioned and which the scholars were at a loss to identify. He was also an accomplished historian and he composed a chronology of Jewish history from the time of the creation to his own day under the name of “Seder Haolam”.
Rabbi Jose frequently related the customs of previous generations and he based his own opinions on those customs. He thus elucidated customs concerning the scapegoat,<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא ס״ו א׳.</span></i> the sanctification of the new month,<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה כ״ב א׳.</span></i> the regulations pertaining to women who bring offerings to the temple,<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה ט״ז ב׳.</span></i> and numerous others.
The miracles accompanying the creation of the world Rabbi Jose described in an unusually poetic manner. People, he said, look but they know not what they see; they stand and they know not what they stand on. Consider the earth for instance. What is the earth supported by? The earth is supported by pillars; the pillars of the earth are based on water; the water rests on mountains; the mountains hang in the air; the air rests on storm and the storm is held in the arms of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה י״ב ב׳.</span></i>
His concepts of justice are exemplified by his statement that a witness who has been proved false in money matters may testify in cases affecting life.<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין כ״ז ב׳.</span></i> He maintained that a court may admit the testimony of such a witness on the ground that if a man states a falsehood once it is not proof that he will testify falsely every time.
Another time he said: “See how blind usurers are. If a man should call another person a wicked man he would be ready to kill him, but usurers bring witnesses and a scribe and they sign their own names to a statement that they deny the Jewish God who commanded not to loan money for interest.<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא ע״א א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jose often disputed with infidels and among them was one matron who asked innumerable questions. Once she asked him what God was doing all the time and he replied that God was busy making ladders on which he raised some people and lowered others; to some He gives money and from others He takes it away to give it to others. The matron was dissatisfied with this answer and Rabbi Jose said that at the time God was busy arranging marriages.
Hearing this the matron exclaimed: “Is this all that your God does? I can do the same. I have a host of men and women slaves and in one hour I can marry them all to each other.” Rabbi Jose replied, “That which seems easy in your eyes is as difficult for God as the rending of the sea.” The matron then chose one thousand men slaves and one thousand women slaves and arranged them in two lines and declared, “This slave will marry this woman servant and this woman servant will marry that slave.” In this manner she mates them all in a short time.
The following day they all came to her with various complaints. One had a broken head and another had a black eye or a broken leg. When the matron asked them what had happened they voiced their protests that she had chosen for them the wrong mates. The matron then realized that marriage between two human beings was not as simple as she thought it to be.<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ס״ח פּיסקא ד׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jose had five sons: R. Ishmael, R. Elazar, R. Chalafta, R. Abtilas and R. Menahem. All of them figured among the scholars of their time and Rabbi Jose proudly said that he had planted five cedar trees among the Jews.<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ח ב׳.</span></i>
It is also noteworthy that Rabbi Jose was opposed to afflicting the human body and he declared that an individual may not establish fast days for himself for if such a person will need the aid of others they will refuse it and say that he is used to fasting.<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית כ״ב ב׳.</span></i>
When Rabbi Jose ben Chalafta died it was said that “the pipes of Lodakia flowed with blood”. The reason that was given for this phenomenon was Rabbi Jose’s readiness to die for the fulfillment of the commandment of circumcision<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי עבודה זרה פרק ג׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> Another text declares that “the pipes of Sephoris flowed with blood”.<sup class="footnote-marker">30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ח ב׳.</span></i>
When Rabbi Jose died it was said that understanding ceased from among the Jews.<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי סוף סוטה.</span></i>

Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai

R<small>ABBI</small> S<small>IMEON BEN</small> Y<small>OCHAI</small> was gifted with numerous virtues which made him a favorite among the people of his district. He also possessed much knowledge and he followed a strictly logical method of reasoning. His activity as a leader dated from the time that he returned from exile when, together with a group of others he escaped the wrath of Hadrian’s decrees after the death of Rabbi Akiba and after he was ordained by Rabbi Jehudah ben Baba. The position of his father Yochai was not very clear and from some statements it would seem that he was an official of the Roman administration and that it was his duty to report all those who did not act in accordance with the Roman laws. This seems to be implied by the story that when Rabbi Akiba was in prison Simeon came to him and asked him to teach him. Rabbi Akiba then said, “I will not teach you”, and Rabbi Simeon said to him: “If you will not teach me I will tell my father and he will report you to the government.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים קי״ב א׳.</span></i>
It is therefore remarkable that although Yochai was an adherent or an official of the Roman government, his son Rabbi Simeon was an enemy of Rome. The authorities were probably aware of his attitude and sought for an opportunity to capture him. When the scholars returned during the reign of Antoninus Pius and resumed their scholarly labors, Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai gained the disfavor of the authorities because of his criticism of the Roman government and he was condemned to death.
Numerous miracles are related concerning the escape of Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai. One of these stories states that he escaped together with his son Elazar and that they hid in the academy for a long time and food was secretly brought to them from their home. But when the authorities intensified their search for Rabbi Simeon he feared his wife might not be able to withstand the stringent questioning and might reveal the hiding place of her husband and son. Father and son decided to hide in a cave and there they were fed in a miraculous manner. A number of carob trees began to grow about the cave and a spring of water appeared.
In that cave—it is further related—they sat naked and buried to the neck in sand and continued their studies. Only when prayer time arrived did they emerge from the sand and donned their garments for the prayer. With praying finished they again disrobed, in order not to wear out their garments, and continued sitting buried in sand.
Thus they sat for thirteen years until one day Elijah appeared and said, “Who will announce to Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai that the emperor died?” Rabbi Simeon and his son then left the cave and when Pinchas ben Yair, Rabbi Simeon’s son-in-law, heard that they had emerged from the cave he went to meet them and took them to his house.
As he was leaving the cave Rabbi Simeon met Rabbi Jehudah ben Gerim, who thirteen years earlier repeated Rabbi Simeon’s remarks which led to his being sentenced to death, and he exclaimed: “This person is still alive?” As he said this he stared at Rabbi Jehudah with his burning eyes and the latter fell down dead.
Rabbi Simeon then began to cure the body of his son and Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair attended to Rabbi Simeon. The body of Rabbi Simeon was creased and swollen from the many years of sitting in the sand and from the diet of “Johns bread” and water. When Rabbi Pinchas saw this, he began to weep and the tears which fell on Rabbi Simeon’s body caused him great suffering because of their salty tang.
This happened in the city of Tiberias where Rabbi Pinchas then lived. Rabbi Simeon bathed in the warm springs of that city and his body healed rapidly. Out of gratitude he wanted to confer some favor on the city and he said: “Since a miracle occurred to me in the city of Tiberias I would gladly do something for this city.” His son then said to him: “For the many favors which this city extended to us we should declare it to be permissible for Jewish residence.”
According to tradition Tiberias was situated on the site of an old cemetery and many priests as well as other pious Jews refused to reside there in order not to be contaminated by the impurity of the dead. Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai declared the city to be clean and fit for residence.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ל״ג ב׳, בראשית רבה פּרשה ע״ט פּיסקא ו׳.</span></i>
One must bear in mind that Tiberias was founded by Herod Antipas, a grandson of Herod the Great, on the site of the ancient city Hamath. When the ancient city was deserted the ground was used as a cemetery. Priests and pious Pharisees therefore refused to settle in the city despite the fact that Herod Antipas freed its inhabitants from all taxes. Only such people as were forced to reside in the city because of their occupations settled there and even these considered their residence in Tiberias as a sin because of the contamination of its soil. Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai therefore favored the city when he decreed it to be clean and fit for the residence of even the most pious.
Palestine was meanwhile again agitated by political unrest. Despite the relatively favorable attitude of Antoninus Pius toward the Jews, they were influenced by the Parthians, who ruled in Babylonia and were independent of Rome, and again revolted against Roman rule. The Parthians were anxious to free themselves from the threat of Roman invasion and attempted a struggle with Rome in which the Jews aided them (or, as others maintain, the Jews began the struggle and were aided by the Parthians).
The Jews felt confident of achieving liberation with the aid of the Parthians. The Roman empire was then occupied with wars on many fronts due to the simultaneous revolts of the Germans and the Dacians. It was therefore said that “whenever one sees the horse of a Parthian tied to a tombstone in Palestine he may expect the early coming of the Messiah.” Another statement of the scholars declared that “they who have destroyed the temple will in the end fall into the hands of the Parthians.”<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">The two above mentioned quotations from the Talmud use the name “Parsim” (Persians) but it is obvious that the Parthians and not the Persians were referred to.</i>
This rebellion lasted for four years until the Romans triumphed again under the leadership of Atidius Cornelianus. It may be surmised that the Jews again had to withstand persecution and oppression. The first decree abrogated the right of the Jews to be tried before a Jewish court in civil disputes. This decree was not considered as a great calamity and Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai even declared his satisfaction with it because “Jews no longer have the wise men required to decide in such matters.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי סנהדרין פרק ה׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
The Roman imperial throne was also in an uncertain state at that time. At first Hadrian appointed Antoninus Pius as his successor. Later he made the acquaintance of Marcus Aurelius, who was a military leader, and he liked him also. Hadrian then commanded Antoninus Pius to appoint Marcus Aurelius as his successor. Since that day Marcus Aurelius assumed the name Antoninus and after the death of Antonius Pius the Roman senate decided that a son of his, named Lucius Varus, should share the throne with Marcus Aurelius. It thus occurred that two emperors reigned simultaneously.
During this war against Rome the Parthians advanced into the Roman provinces to the north west of their possessions until they arrived in Syria. Under the leadership of their king Valagesias they captured the Roman governor Atidius Cornelianus and put him to death. Afterward they occupied one Syrian city after another and for a moment it seemed that the Romans would be expelled from Palestine forever. But these victories were not lasting and when emperor Varus arrived with reenforcements of Roman legions the Parthians were driven out from all the positions which they had occupied.
It would seem that the scholars remained neutral in this war. No mention is made either of their participation or of their opposition to it. But since emperor Varus reenacted some of Hadrian’s decrees forbidding the observance of the Sabbath and the practice of circumcision it may be assumed that the masses of the people actively participated in the struggle with the consent of the scholars or against their wishes. It is also apparent that the Nasi, Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel, no longer lived at that time and that no other Nasi had yet been elected by that time.
When Varus died, Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai was sent to Rome to intercede with emperor Antoninus Marcus Aurelius and to obtain the nullification of the decrees of Varus. Although they knew that Marcus Aurelius was not favorably inclined toward the Jews they trusted his sense of justice for he was known as a kindly and philosophical man.
To accompany Rabbi Simeon the scholars sent Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Jose ben Chalafta, who could speak Latin. Both arrived in Rome and, with the aid of the Roman Jews, who wielded a considerable influence in government circles, they successfully completed their mission.
Legend relates the following miracle to have occurred during this journey. The emperor’s daughter Lucilla was then possessed by a “devil” or “dybbuk” with the name Bar Tamalion. Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai expelled the spirit and as a reward the emperor told him to enter the treasury and to choose the most valuable gift. Rabbi Simeon entered the royal treasury and selected the document of Varus’ decrees against the Jews and he forthwith tore it before the emperor.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מעילה י׳׳ז ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai was a pupil of Rabbi Akiba for thirteen years and he did not leave him until the day of Rabbi Akiba’s martyr death. But once Rabbi Akiba expressed his preference of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Simeon was displeased. Even Rabbi Akiba’s later statement that Rabbi Simeon should “be satisfied that I and God know how to appreciate your power” failed to reconcile him.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי סנהדרין פרק א׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i> Rabbi Simeon remembered this incident long after Rabbi Akiba died and he allowed himself to say that which no other disciple allowed himself; he declared that Rabbi Akiba’s interpretation of four Biblical verses were not correct and that his own explanations were more acceptable than Rabbi Akiba’s.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה י״ח ב׳, תוספתא סוטה פרק ו׳.</span></i> Another time he addressed his pupils in the following words: “My children, copy my manners for mine are copied from Rabbi Akiba’s best manners.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ס״ז א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Simeon’s system of study was highly original and he always sought the cause of the interpretations of the text of the Torah. He always asked: “Why does the Torah command us to do this?” In this respect he was an exception in his generation. He based his opinions on reason irrespective of whether they were in agreement with the opinions of scholars of previous generations. In such cases he showed no reverence for his contemporaries nor for authorities of an earlier day. Intentionally he sought to exterminate ideas which others planted when he was convinced of their incorrectness.
The Torah commanded that the garment of a widow may not be taken in pawn and the Mishna<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא קט״ו א׳.</span></i> declared that this law applied equally to rich as well as to poor widows. But Rabbi Simeon declared that this regulation applied only to poor widows because the rich ones undoubtedly possessed other garments. Unable to base his opinion on purely humanitarian grounds he explained that in the case of a poor widow, who may not have any other garments, such a pawn would have to be returned every evening and the repeated visits of the pawnbroker may cause suspicion to be cast on the character of the widow.
Rabbi Simeon also sought to lighten the burden of the observance of the Sabbath in contradiction to the other scholars who heaped prohibition upon prohibition. He thus allowed the moving of household furniture if care was taken not to dig up the ground in doing so.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת כ״ב א׳.</span></i> He ruled similarly concerning other types of work which were at that time prohibited.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת צ״ה א׳, ק״ו ב׳.</span></i>
Fully cognizant of his worth Rabbi Simeon never pretended modesty. On the contrary, he sometimes expressed himself in a manner which might indicate pride. Thus he said: “There are few good people in the world. If there are a thousand such then I and my son are among them. If there are one hundred such then I and my son are among them. If there are only two such then I and my son are they.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוכה מ׳׳ה ב׳.</span></i> On the same occasion he further stated: “Because of my merit I can redeem the world from judgment for all sins that have ben committed since the time of my birth until this day. Were the merit of my son Elazar to be joined to mine I could free the world from judgment for all sins that were committed since the creation of the world until this day.”
Like the other scholars of his day Rabbi Simeon also sought to preserve peace between husband and wife, but he never sought to attain this end at the expense of his own dignity. We have previously told of how Rabbi Meir allowed a woman to spit in his face when her husband commanded her to do so. Another man refused to partake of his wife’s cooking until Rabbi Jehudah and Rabbi Simeon would taste of it. Rabbi Jehudah then agreed to do so but Rabbi Simeon said: “Were the man to starve and were the woman to remain a widow and her children were to die I would not do this.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדרים כ״ו ב׳.</span></i>
In this connection it is interesting to relate an incident which occurred while Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai was in Sidon. A married couple who lived together for ten years and had no children came to him to obtain a divorce. Rabbi Simeon said to them: “Since you do not want to part in anger you must do now as you did at the time of your wedding. At your wedding you made a feast; you must also make a feast at your parting.”
The husband and wife did as Rabbi Simeon advised them. During the feast the husband became merry with drink and he said to his wife: “Choose that which is most beautiful and dearest to you in the house and take it with you when you return to your father’s house.” When the husband fell asleep she ordered the slaves to carry him on his bed to her father’s house. When he awoke and found himself in strange surroundings he asked his wife, “Where am I?” and she replied, “You are in my father’s house”.
The man further asked, “What have I to do in your father’s house?” and his wife replied, “You asked me to take that which I held dearest in your house and I could find nothing dearer to me than yourself”. They then went to Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai a second time to ask him what to do. He advised them not to part for he was certain that God would reward such a wife with children. He also promised to pray for them.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שיר השירים רבה פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא ל״א.</span></i>
Rabbi Simeon’s attitude toward the Romans was always one of condemnation. He could never forget the suffering which the Romans inflicted upon the Jews nor the fact that all scolars had to flee Palestine to save their lives. Even when they were allowed to return during the rule of Antonius Pius they were forced to wander from city to city. At first they settled in Sidon, later in Usha and finally in Jabneh. When Rabbi Simeon expressed criticism of the Romans he was forced to hide in a cave. All of these events aroused within him a hatred for all Romans and he declared that the best among the Romans was like a snake whose head should be crushed.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכילתא פּ׳ בשלח.</span></i> Another time he said that only Jews may be considered as human beings.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ס״א א׳.</span></i>
As a result of these events and also because of his personal misfortunes Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai became embittered and he ruled that as long as Jews are in exile no one must laugh wholeheartedly.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ל״א א׳.</span></i> When in later life he suffered from being reported to the government he ruled that even wicked people who curse their fathers and deserve to forfeit their lives according to law, should not be reported to the authorities.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים פּ״ז ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Simeon valued the Torah above all else and he declared that “Three who have eaten at one table and have not said over it words of the Torah are as if they had eaten of the sacrifice of the dead.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק ג׳ משנה ג׳.</span></i> He further said that no scholar may partake of a feast the purpose of which is not to fulfill some commandment,<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים מ״ט א׳.</span></i> and that people who do not engage in learning are to be punished.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ל״ג ב׳.</span></i>
“Three valuable gifts God granted to the Jews”, he said, “and all three are bound up with suffering. These three gifts are: the Torah, the Land of Israel and the world to come.”<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ה׳ א׳.</span></i>
“If I had been present on Mount Sinai when the Torah was given to the Jews”, he said, “I would have asked God to grant us two mouths, one for the study of the Torah and the other for all other purposes.” But he immediately added that two mouths might even be worse than one for if one mouth can cause so much trouble by carrying reports, how much worse might the world be if people possessed two mouths.<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק א׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>
Being imbued with such a great love for the Torah Rabbi Simeon abhored all those who rebelled against its commandments and he said: “Whoever wishes to taunt a wicked man may do so without compunction”,<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ז׳ ב׳.</span></i> for the gain of a wicked man is the loss of a just man.<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">הוריות י׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Speaking of relations between people Rabbi Simeon declared that deceiving one’s neighbor by words is even more wicked than obtaining his money under false pretenses.<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא נ״ח ב׳.</span></i>
The saintliness of Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai was revered among Jews long after his death and it was said that during his lifetime no rainbow ever appeared because no flood could have descended upon the world due to his merit.<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ט׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i> It is also related that when Rabbi Joshua ben Levi died he entered paradise and there he found Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai reclining on thirteen golden thrones. Rabbi Simeon asked him: “Did a rainbow ever appear during your life time?” and Rabbi Joshua said that it did. Rabbi Simeon remarked: “If so, then you were not a very just man.”<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ע״ז ב׳.</span></i>
Upon returning from his hiding place in the cave Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai settled in Meron where he lived until his death. The anniversary of his death is observed in Meron to this day.
During all the years that Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai and his son Rabbi Elazar remained secluded in their cave they pondered the mysteries of the Torah. It must be borne in mind that no books except the Bible were then available. The Mishna was then still being repeated orally and if someone wrote down interpretations of the Torah these were not circulated in writing in order to prevent such writings from assuming the sanctity of the written scriptures. It is therefore quite certain that Rabbi Simeon possessed no written books in his cave.
Leading an isolated existence and deriving nourishment from a carob tree and a spring of water for thirteen long years the thoughts of Rabbi Simeon and his son naturally turned to the mysteries of the creation of the world and to original interpretations of the Biblical texts. The proximity of the desert, the encounters with wild animals and poisonous snakes and their miraculous escapes, all these no doubt still further accentuated their interest in the imponderable aspects of life.
When they emerged from the cave later and resumed their teaching in the academy they expressed many of the mystical conclusions and observations which accumulated during the years they lived as hermits. These ideas they wrote down, or repeated orally to their pupils who gathered them in book form. But since these ideas had no direct bearing on the legal regulations they remained unknown for centuries until a Jewish scholar discovered them and compiled the famous book of “Zohar”.

Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua and Rabbi Jochanan the Sandalmaker

A<small>FTER</small> R<small>ABBI</small> A<small>KIBA’S</small> 12,000 (or 24,000) pupils died and he was imprisoned for treason to the Romans there remained with him only a few disciples who stayed at his side until the time of his execution. Two of these, Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua and Rabbi Jochanan the Sandalmaker, exemplified the spirit of Rabbi Akiba’s last disciples. After the death of Rabbi Akiba they decided to go to Netsivin where Rabbi Jehudah ben Bathyra conducted an academy, but when they reached Sidon and looked back upon the Land of Israel which they were leaving behind they both wept in grief and returned.
These two were the last of Rabbi Akiba’s disciples and Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua was the more prominent of the two.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ס״א פּיסקא ג׳.</span></i> All statements in the Mishna and Boraitha which are quoted in the name of Rabbi Elazar (without further identification) are the opinions of Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">רש״י שבת י״ט ב׳.</span></i> It was said of Rabbi Elazar that he was a pupil of Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah, Rabbi Jose of Galilee and Rabbi Tarphon before he became a disciple of Rabbi Akiba.
Despite his love for Palestine Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua was later forced to seek refuge in a strange country where the persecutions of the Romans were not so severe. When the political situation improved and the Jews were allowed to engage in the Torah again, Rabbi Elazar did not return to Usha with the other scholars. Rabbi Jochanan the Sandalmaker also remained in a foreign land. Rabbi Elazar then founded an academy in one of the cities of Galilee and this institution gained such fame that the Nasi, Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel, sent his son Jehudah to study at this academy. It was said that Jehudah remained there for many years and did not even return to his home for the holidays.
Years later the Nasi Rabbi Jehudah related that when he came to the academy the other pupils surrounded him angrily and would not allow him to engage in study.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות פ״ד א׳.</span></i> The academy was very crowded and six people were forced to sit in the space of one ell.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין נ״ג א׳.</span></i> In his later life Rabbi Jehudah visited Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua to inquire concerning the essense of some of his teachings.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מנחות י״ח א׳.</span></i> From this we may conclude that even after he was Nasi, Rabbi Jehudah still consulted Rabbi Elazar in all difficult questions.
The name of Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua is also listed among the ten martyrs and he was said to have been 105 years old at the time of his death. It was remarked that he never prayed aloud nor quarrelled with other people and that he fasted for 85 (!) years. When he was asked what he had done to merit such a long life he declared that he never used the synagogue as a place for idle wasting of time, he never humiliated others and he did not pronounce the priestly blessing without reciting the benediction first.
The following maxim characterizes Rabbi Elazar’s conception of the proper type of human behavior; he said: “Let the honor of your disciple be dear to you as your own honor, and the honor of your friend should be like your reverence for your master, and your reverence for your master should be like your fear of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות ד׳ י״ב.</span></i> Like other scholars he also spoke frequently of the value of peace and he said: “All the teachings which the prophets sought to implant in the hearts of the people had but one aim—peace.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ספרי פּ׳ ראה.</span></i>
Rabbi Elazar frequently repeated the following parable: “There exist three types of scholars and they may be compared to three kinds of stones. One type of scholar is like a stone pointed at one end; another type may be compared to a two pointed stone, the third type is like a stone which is hewn on all sides. Who may be likened to a stone pointed at one end? One who studied Midrash and if he is questioned of the Midrash he is able to reply. Who may be likened to a two pointed stone? One who studied Midrash and Halacha and when he is questioned he is able to answer from both. Who may be compared to a hewn stone? One who studied Midrash, Halacha, Hagada and Tosephta. Whatever such a scholar is asked he is able to answer.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק כ״ח.</span></i>
There exists one legend connected with the life of Rabbi Elazar for which it is impossible to find any historical substantiation. This legend<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קהלת רבה פּרשה י״א פּיסקא ב׳.</span></i> relates that Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua once strolled on the seashore and he saw a ship tossed on the waves. Before it could be clearly discerned the ship sank with all on board and only one man clung to a board and reached dry land without any clothes. Just then a group of Jews passed by on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. (Although the temple was destroyed Jews continued to make pilgrimages to Jerusalem as often as the Romans allowed them.) The survivor appealed to them and said: “I am one of your brother Esau’s children and I beg that you should give me a garment to cover my nakedness. The sea destroyed my ship and I could save none of my possessions.” To this the Jews replied, “If you are one of Eau’s children then it were better that your whole people had been destroyed.”
The survivor looked around and seeing Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua he said to him, “It is discernible that you are a prominent man among your people and you will no doubt understand that it is not proper to allow a man to go about naked. I therefore beg you to perform a good deed and to give me a garment because the sea had taken all of my possessions.” Rabbi Elazar was wearing seven garments and he immediately removed one of them and he gave it to the man. He then took him to his house and gave him food and drink and a gift of two hundred ducats he also gave him and he mounted him on one of his asses and escorted him a distance of 14 miles to his house.
Some time later the king (?) died and another king was chosen in his place. The new ruler issued a decree against that country (?) to have all the males killed and to do with the women as they chose. The inhabitants of that country asked Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua to intercede with the king on their behalf and they gave him 4000 ducats to offer as a gift to the king. Rabbi Elazar proceeded to the palace of the king and when he entered the throne room the king descended from his throne and bowed before him and asked, “What is your request?”
Rabbi Elazar said: “I want you to have mercy on the kingdom and to rescind your decree.” The king then replied: “It is written in your Torah that an Edomite or a Moabite may not be included in the congregation of God because they did not meet the Jews with bread and water when they came out of the land of Egypt. The Torah also states that you may not humiliate an Edomite because he is your brother. But your people dealt otherwise with me and because they did not observe this commandment of the Torah they have forfeited their lives.”
“Nevertheless you must forgive them,” Rabbi Elazar said. “You must have mercy on them for if they did not act according to the commandment of the Torah they did so out of foolishness and God will forgive them.” Saying this Rabbi Elazar handed the king the 4000 ducats which the people gave him. Then the king said, “The 4000 ducats you may keep instead of the 200 ducats which you gave me. Because you gave me food and drink I will also forgive the sins of that country. You may also enter my treasury and choose the most beautiful garments for the one garment that you gave me to wear.”

The name of Rabbi Jochanan the Sandalmaker is mentioned only three times in connection with legal matters. When the question arose concerning the case of a woman who received “Halitza” in the presence of witnesses one of whom was later proved to be a relative of the woman, or disqualified as a witness for some other reason and it was decided that such “Halitza” was invalid, Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai and Rabbi Jochanan the Sandalmaker declared that such “Halitza” was valid. During this debate Rabbi Jochanan related his ruse in visiting Rabbi Akiba in prison to ask his opinion in this question.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ק״ד ב׳.</span></i>
A maxim of Rabbi Jochanan stated: “Every assembly which is conducted for the sake of God will remain permanent, but assemblies which are not for the sake of God will not last.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק ד׳ משנה י״א.</span></i>
Opinions differ concerning his appelation of “Sandlar” (sandalmaker). The book of genealogies (Yuchasin) declares that Rabbi Jochanan was a sandalmaker or that he drilled pearls to be strung, but some modern philologists dispute this point of view and interpret the name “Sandlar” to indicate that he was a native of Alexandria.

Rabbi Nehemiah and Other Disciples of Rabbi Akiba

T<small>HE LAST</small> disciples of Rabbi Akiba began the work of compiling the Mishna as they received it from their master. One of these was Rabbi Nehemiah who participated in the first gathering of the scholars after the death of emperor Hadrian.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ס״א פּיסקא ג׳.</span></i> He was also present at the convocation at Usha although he did not actively participate in it.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ס״ג ב׳.</span></i>
Little is known of the life and activities of Rabbi Nehemiah except the fact that he was very poor and a potter by trade.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות כ״ו ב׳, ירושלמי בבא מציעא פרק ו׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i> The name of his father is also unknown although it is certain that he was a prominent scholar because Rabbi Nehemiah once quoted his opinion in a legal matter<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים נ״ד א׳.</span></i> Rabbi Nehemiah opposed the methodology of Rabbi Jehudah bar Elai and contradictory reports concerning his personality were circulated in later generations. One opinion claimed that all anonymous statements in the Tosephta were those of Rabbi Nehemiah.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין פ״ו א׳.</span></i> When the book of the genealogy of the noble families of Jerusalem was discovered it was found that Rabbi Nehemiah was a descendant of Nehemiah the Thirshata.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי תענית פרק ד׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>
Another belief current in later generations maintained that Rabbi Nehemiah was identical with the Tana Rabbi Nehorai. In explanation it was said that he was called Nehorai because he shed light on doubtful legal questions.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קמ״ז ב׳.</span></i> But Rabbi Nehorai had also been previously identified with Rabbi Elazar ben Arach.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין י״ג ב׳.</span></i> These beliefs therefore lack all substantiation because we also find a text quoting a dispute between Rabbi Nehorai and Rabbi Nehemiah and on another occasion the opinions of both are listed side by side.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין צ״ב א׳, דברים רבה פּרשה ג׳ פּיסקא י׳.</span></i>
The following statements are characteristic of Rabbi Nehemiah’s ethical precepts: “Suffering is good for people. Just as sacrifices placate God and still his anger even so does human suffering placate the Almighty. Moreover, human suffering is even more effective than the offering of sacrifices.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכילתא פּרשה כ׳.</span></i> “The sin of unfounded hatred is punished by domestic discord, frequent miscarriage and the early death of children.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ל״ב ב׳.</span></i> “He who undertakes to fulfill even one commandment honestly is deserving that the Holy Spirit should rest upon him. Thus we see that our forefathers left Egypt and believed in God and the Holy Spirit rested upon them and they merited the privilege of praising God.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכילתא י״ד ל״א.</span></i>
Speaking of the time of the coming of the Messiah Rabbi Nehemiah declared that “brazenness will then increase and honored men will follow devious ways. The vineyards will bear fruit but wine will be scarce. Government will be transformed into the rule of cliques and there will be no man capable of pointing out the right path.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין צ״ז א׳.</span></i>
In his exposition of the Scriptures Rabbi Nehemiah based his opinions on logic as well as on the grammatical structure of the Scriptural texts. He said: “The words of the Torah are sometimes insufficient in one place and superfluous in another.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ראש השנה פרק ג׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i> When scholars expressed differing opinions regarding the duration of the time known as <span dir="rtl">בין השמשות</span> (twilight), Rabbi Nehemiah declared that it lasts as long as it would take a man to walk one thousand ells.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ל״ד ב׳.</span></i>
* * *
Another important Tana of that time was Rabbi Joshua ben Korcha. Talmudic commentators such as Rashi, Rabenu Gershom Meor Hagolah and Rashbam claim that he was the son of Rabbi Akiba, who was nicknamed “Kereach” (the bald) because of the statement of Ben Azai who said that all Jewish scholars are worth no more than the skin of garlic except the bald one (referring to Rabbi Akiba). As a result of this Rabbi Joshua came to be called Ben Korcha, the son of the bald one.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בכורות נ״ח א׳.</span></i> But Tosaphoth argues that this could not be the case and that Ben Azai’s reference to Rabbi Akiba as “the bald one” did not suffice to justify Rabbi Joshua’s appellation of Ben Korcha instead of ben Rabbi Akiba. The chronological order of the generations is also against such an assumption. When Rabbi Joshua was dying, the Nasi, Rabbi Jehudah, asked him for a blessing and Rabbi Joshua said: “I wish that you may live at least half as many years as I did”.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלח כ״ח א׳.</span></i> Had Rabbi Joshua been the son of Rabbi Akiba this blessing would have been meaningless.
Rabbi Joshua’s name is mentioned only four times in the Mishna, but the Talmud frequently quotes his legal opinions. Rabbi Joshua was in favor of allowing witnesses to appear one after the other<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות כ״ו ב׳.</span></i> and he declared that a messenger had the same legal powers as his sender.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין מ׳׳א ב׳.</span></i> He believed in the strict enforcement of all Scriptural commandments but he was lenient concerning the fulfillment of the Rabbinical regulations.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה ז׳ א׳.</span></i>
The following of his moral maxims are noteworthy: “He who studies the Torah but does not review his studies may be compared to a man who sows a field but does not harvest the crop.”<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין צ״ט א׳.</span></i> “He who hides his eyes from charity is like one who worships idols.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ס״ח א׳.</span></i>
Brigandage was very prevalent at that time and the government found itself powerless to suppress it. Whether these were ordinary robbers or rebels whom the government declared to be bandits is hard to determine today. It is interesting to note, however, that the government appointed Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai, who hid with his father in a cave for many years, to exterminate the brigands. This office was similar to that of his grandfather Yochai which was commented on previously.
Rabbi Elazar had been a pupil of Rabbi Joshua ben Korcha for some time and when Rabbi Joshua heard of the new office of his pupil he sent the following message to him: “Who gave you the right to exterminate God’s people?” Rabbi Elazar replied: “I only pull out the weeds from the vineyard.” To this Rabbi Joshua retorted: “The owner of the vineyard can destroy the weeds himself.”<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פ״ג ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Joshua ben Korcha lived to a ripe old age. According to some he was 160 years old at the time of his death. The Nasi, Rabbi Jehudah, once asked him to explain the cause of his long life but Rabbi Joshua felt offended and said: “Are you tired of seeing me alive?” Rabbi Jehudah assured him to the contrary and explained that he was interested from a scientific point of view. Placated, Rabbi Joshua answered: “All my life I never looked at a wicked man.”<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה כ״ח א׳.</span></i>

Among the scholars who met in Jabneh and later in Usha after the destruction of Betar there was also Rabbi Eliezer, the son of Rabbi Jose of Galilee.<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ס״ג ב׳.</span></i> Of him it was said that whenever Rabbi Elizer spoke of the Hagada it was advisable to pay close attention.<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין פ״ט ב׳.</span></i> He rarely participated in legal discussions and he gained his fame by compiling a list of 32 rules of logic according to which the Hagada was being interpreted. Aside from two or three laws which are ascribed to him we possess a statement of Rabbi Eliezer which says: “If one begins to fulfill a commandment but does not complete it and another man finishes the work, credit is given to the one who finished the work.<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ה׳ פּיסקא ג׳.</span></i>

Rabbi Jehudah the Nasi

A<small>S A RESULT</small> of the renewed persecution of the Jewish faith which became effective after the death of emperor Antoninus Pius, Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel the Second had to move his academy from Usha to Shefarom. The new decrees which were promulgated during the joint reign of Lucius Varus and Marcus Aurelius did not strike at the study of the Torah but only at the observance of its commandments, particularly as they concerned the observance of the Sabbath and the practice of circumcision. When Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel II died, his son Rabbi Jehudah was appointed Nasi. Although documentary evidence is lacking, it is apparent that the assumption of office by the new Nasi took place with the consent of the authorities. Roman suspicion of the Nasi’s descent from the royal House of David had subsided by that time and no attempt was any longer being made to offer the office to a man of less aristocratic lineage.
The Talmud always refers to Rabbi Jehuda the Nasi only by his title of “Rabbi”. Because his contemporaries were convinced that he was the most pious man since the days of Moses, he was also called “Rabenu Hakadosh”, our holy teacher. His whole life history is surrounded by legends of miracles which were said to have occurred from the day of his birth until many weeks after his death. It was said that he was born on the same day that Rabbi Akiba was executed.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ע״ב ב׳.</span></i> Hadrian’s decrees against the practice of circumcision were then in full force and both the child and its parents had to forfeit their lives. One Midrash relates that Rabbi Jehudah’s parents were reported to the government for having circumcised their son. Parents and child were then brought before the emperor (more correctly before the imperial representative then residing in Palestine), but a Gentile neighbor who was a member of a prominent Roman aristocratic family pitied the child and she gave her own son to Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel to show to the judges.
The city wherein Rabbi Jehudah was born is unknown. Because of the turbulence of the times it is impossible to know definitely where Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel resided at that time. Being the son of the Nasi and destined to occupy the post of his father, Rabbi Jehudah was provided with the best tutors who acquainted him with all sciences. Gifted with great talents and a natural curiosity he absorbed much learning and assimilated it in his personality. In his youth Rabbi Jehudah studied with his father<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שבת פרק י׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i> and later he was a pupil of the academies of Rabbi Jehudah bar Elai, Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua and others.
Rabbi Jehudah evinced a great love of the Bible and all his life he sought to establish Hebrew or Greek as the spoken language among the Jews. He was grieved to hear the Jews speak a mixture of languages<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא פ״ג א׳.</span></i> and in his own household everyone spoke Hebrew. Rabbi Jehudah owned a woman slave (frequently mentioned in the Talmud as “the servant in the house of Rabbi”) who was an authority on the Hebrew language and who was often consulted by some of the scholars in the matter of the Hebrew names of various subjects.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה כ״ו ב׳, מגלה י״ח א׳, ירושלמי שביעית פרק ט׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
Like his predecessors Rabbi Jehudah also devoted much time to the study of the natural sciences. His position as Nasi imposed upon him the obligation of determining the dates of the new months and the holidays and he had to know astronomy. He likewise had to know the nature of various plants and animals in connection with the dietary laws and the regulations pertaining to cleanliness. These sciences attained a higher stage of development among the Gentiles who were not bound by the regulations of the Torah and Rabbi Jehudah declared that whenever a law was not involved the opinion of Gentile naturalists was to be considered as more valid than the opinions of the Jewish scholars.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים צ״ה ב׳, יבמות פ׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jehudah Hanasi was very rich and his wealth was often described with fantastic exaggeration as, for instance, when it was said that his cattle fed from golden troughs and that his stables contained more gold than the treasure rooms of the Persian king.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פ״ג ב׳.</span></i> Because of his prominent position he had to conduct a lavish court in the manner of a royal prince, but it is nevertheless known that he used little of his wealth for his personal use.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ק״ד א׳.</span></i> Whenever necessary he gave generously for charitable purposes, for the maintenance of needy students and to feed the poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא ח׳ א׳.</span></i>
At that time there occurred a great famine throughout all the provinces of the Roman empire. Rabbi Jehudah opened his storehouses filled with grain to distribute to the poor but at first he commanded that only those who had studied the Torah should be given bread. One of his disciples, Rabbi Jonathan ben Amram, appeared dressed as an Am Haaretz and when Rabbi Jehudah refused to give him bread he said: “Does not even a crow or a dog have the right to be fed?” Rabbi Jehudah then concluded that no distinctions should be made in the matter of the distribution of bread and he commanded that it be given to all who asked for it.
Despite his great personal success Rabbi Jehudah never exhibited the least sign of pride. None of the scholars so readily acknowledged the value and the superiority of the others as he did.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פ״ד ב׳.</span></i> The following was one of his most favorite maxims: “I have learned much from my teachers; I have learned even more from my friends, but I have learned most from my pupils.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכות ו׳ א׳.</span></i> When certain activities of other people were being judged and criticism was leveled against them, Rabbi Jehudah carefully weighed his opinions before passing judgment. When a man was brought for trial before Rabbi Jehudah on the grounds that he did not observe the regulations of the Sabbatical year, Rabbi Jehudah carefully listened to the accusation as well as to the arguments of the defendant and said: “What else could you expect the poor man to do when he was hungry?”<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי תענית פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
Like his grandfather, Rabban Gamliel of Jabneh, Rabbi Jehudah realized that the regulations of the Sabbatical year were a heavy burden upon the poorer people and that they should be modified. The poorer elements of the community usually remained without bread on the Sabbatical year and it was obvious that they had to resort to eating the fruit which ripened on that year. Rabbi Jehudah was ready to open the subject for discussion with Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair but realizing that he would be overruled he said nothing.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי דמאי פרק א׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i> Nevertheless he succeeded in repealing several prohibitions of the Sabbatical year which were effective till that time. Rabbi Jehudah acted similarly to reduce the burden of the tithes<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי דמאי פרק ב׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> and he also declared that the population should not be burdened with too many fasts.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית י״ד ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jehudah Hanasi never insisted on his personal prerogatives but he severely punished all infringements on the dignity of the office of Nasi. The office of Nasi therefore attained a great measure of authority. Wherever Jews lived the word of the Nasi was listened to attentively. His pronouncements were considered as law and no one dared to criticize his actions. Rabbi Jehudah devoted much effort to the attainment of this goal and he was successful. In Babylonia as well as in Palestine and in all the other countries his decisions were unquestioned. As a result of this the organization of Jewish life proceeded in better order than ever before and it was said that “from Moses until Rabbi Jehudah Hanasi there was not another man who combined learning and greatness of spirit to such a degree.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ל״ז א׳, גטין נ״ט ב׳.</span></i>
Because of his descent from Hillel of Babylonia and from king David, Jews accorded him all honors of which they were capable. He was the recognized leader of the people and his word carried more weight than that of all the other members of the Court together. His opinion determined whether one of the disciples should be ordained irrespective of the opinions of the other scholars. At that time it was also ruled that “when a court appoints one to an office without the sanction of the Nasi such appointment is invalid; but when the Nasi appoints a person to an office without the sanction of the court the appointment is valid.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי סנהדרין פרק א׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>
The court of Rabbi Jehudah Hanasi had no superior judge (<span dir="rtl">אב בית דין</span>) and the post of “Chacham” was also done away with. These changes eliminated conflicts and disputes between the Nasi and the other scholars. Rabbi Jehudah also knew how to keep his decisions within certain bounds. He always sensed possible opposition to new and radical legislation and he avoided enacting it. Due to the changing developments in the political situation in Palestine he felt compelled to introduce some reforms in Jewish religious life. He thus abolished the time honored custom of lighting fires on the mountain tops to announce the beginning of a new month which determined the dates of the holidays and he substituted the sending of messengers to the communities instead.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ראש השנה פרק ב׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
The cause of this innovation was the renewed animosity between the Samaritans and the Jews which flared up again after a period of friendship among the two peoples when they were both equally oppressed by the Romans. In order to confuse the Jews in the celebration of their holidays the Samaritans often lit fires on the mountain tops at the wrong time. As Rabbi Ishmael ben Rabbi Jose was once making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem he passed through Shechem. The Samaritans ridiculed him for making a pilgrimage to a ruin which God rejected and declared that it would be more reasonable to offer prayers on Mount Gerizim which had been blessed by God. Rabbi Ishmael replied that the Samaritans probably venerate mount Gerizim because Jacob buried on it the idols which he took from Laban’s house. This reply incensed the Samaritans and they were ready to kill Rabbi Ishmael who escaped with great difficulty.<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין ו׳ א׳, ירושלמי עבודה זרה פרק ה׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
The observance of the Sabbatical year and the payment of tithes at that time began to constitute a severe problem due to the prevalent poverty. Rabbi Jehudah modified the regulations governing the Sabbatical year and the tithes. Moreover he could see no justification for the continued payment of tithes to the Priests and Levites after the Temple was destroyed. He therefore declared the environs of many cities which were not included in the first conquest of Canaan by Joshua as foreign territory and not subject to those commandments which were operative in Palestine only. The inhabitants of these districts were thus freed from the burden of both the Sabbatical year and the tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין ו׳ ב׳, ירושלמי דמאי פרק ב׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
The conditions of Jewish life had also changed to such an extent that it became necessary to think of modifying the restrictions of the Sabbath in order to allow people to go from one city to another as was the case between the cities of Geder and Hamthan.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין ס״א א׳, ירושלמי ערובין פרק ה׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i> Rabbi Jehudah also simplified the procedure for accepting proselytes<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ס׳ ב׳, ירושלמי יבמות פרק ה׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i> and he attempted to modify the observance of the ninth day of Ab. His reforms in this case are not entirely clear. The Talmud relates that he wanted to do away with the observance of the ninth day of Ab altogether. Later scholars doubted the possibility of such an intention and declared that he merely wanted to abolish the fasting when that day coincided with the Sabbath. Since fasting was prohibited on the Sabbath he wanted to do away with the fast on such a year.<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה ה׳ ב׳, ירושלמי מגלה פרק א׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jehudah ruled that students who were considered capable of heading an academy should not be allowed to open one without the permission of the Nasi.<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ה׳ ב׳.</span></i> He also instructed his son Rabban Gamliel, who was to be his successor, to conduct himself with dignity and to inspire fear among his disciples.<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ק״ג ב׳.</span></i>
Speaking to one of his disciples (Rabbi Chiya) Rabbi Jehudah declared that he would do the wish of any person except that which the Men of Bathyra did when they renounced the office of Nasi in favor of Hillel. “But”, he added, “were the Exilarch Rav Huna to come from Babylonia, I would not renounce my office but I would give him the seat of honor for he is descended from a son of king David while I am descended from a daughter of the king.”
Some time later, when this conversation had been forgotten by all, Rabbi Chiya entered the academy of Rabbi Jehudah and announced: “The Exilarch Rav Huna of Babylonia has arrived.” He noticed that Rabbi Jehudah’s face changed colors from great agitation and he immediately added: “The dead Rav Huna and not the living one has arrived.” (Rav Huna commanded in his will that his body be interred in Palestine and it was the arrival of the body that Rabbi Chiya announced.)
Rabbi Jehudah Hanasi was greatly angered at this attempt to confuse him for even a moment and he punished Rabbi Chiya by denying him entrance into the academy for thirty days.<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי כלאים פרק א׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>
Another angry outburst of Rabbi Jehudah against Bar Kapara is related in the following story. Rabbi Jehudah had a son-in-law named Ben Elasha who was a wealthy man but not versed in learning. On the occasion of a feast which Rabbi Jehudah tendered in his house the guests proposed riddles for the audience to solve, but Ben Elasha remained silent. Bar Kapara then said to him: “Why are you silent, brother?” And Ben Elasha replied: “You know that I know not what to say.” Bar Kapara suggested that he should ask the following riddle:
The grebe looks down from heaven, it hovers in all the corners of the house, it frightens all the birds. Young ones see it and hide, old ones remain standing in fright. Whoever escapes cries out in pain and he who is caught, is caught in his own sin.
This riddle was aimed at the leadership of Rabbi Jehudah and he understood that it could not have been thought up by his son-in-law. Rabbi Jehudah also noticed Bar Kapara smiling and he felt certain that Bar Kapara was the author of the riddle. In great anger he exclaimed: “I do not want to know you any longer, old man.” This was a great blow for Bar Kapara who could never obtain ordination after that, although he deserved it more than many others.<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי מועד קטן פרק ג׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
A similar incident occurred with Shmuel Yarchinai who was one of the greatest scholars of the time, but who never received ordination. He had served Rabbi Jehudah Hanasi for many years as physician and cured him from a dangerous disease. It is unknown what Shmuel Yarchinai’s offense consisted of. It is also possible that he did not receive ordination because of insufficient acquaintance with the law; he devoted himself mainly to the sciences such as astronomy and astrology. Shmuel consoled himself with the belief that since the time of Adam it had already been foretold that he would be a learned man but not ordained and that he would bring about the cure of Rabbi Jehudah Hanasi.<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פּ״ו א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jehudah was prone to anger as a result of his sickness which caused him great suffering. These outbursts of anger brought about a subdued discontent among his disciples as well as among the members of his household. This discontent was never uttered except on one occasion during a feast in the house of the Nasi. When everyone was merry with wine, Rabbi Jehudah asked the two children of Rabbi Chiya, Jehudah and Hezekiah, to say something. The two boys began describing the time of the coming of the Messiah and they said that Messiah would not arrive until the two ruling houses, those of the Nasi and of the Exilarch of Babylonia, would be done away with for these hinder the redemption. Rabbi Jehudah was greatly grieved to hear this but being in a good mood he did not expel the boys from the house, and he merely remarked: “Children, you cast thorns in my eyes.”<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ל״ח א׳.</span></i>
The whole generation of Rabbi Jehudah was unanimous in its veneration of the saintliness of the man and he was therefore called “Rabenu Hakadosh” (Our holy teacher). His personal qualities and his nobility in his relation with people caused him to be the beloved friend of a Roman emperor (according to some historians it was a Roman governor) who secretly visited him to gain information on Judaism until he was convinced of the truth of the Jewish faith and became converted. One must bear in mind that the Romans looked with contempt upon the Jews at that time. A Jew who could win the friendship of a Roman emperor, or governor, had to be a shining example among millions. Under these circumstances it is understandable why the Jewish people idolized Rabbi Jehudah and when Rabbi Simeon ben Menasia listed seven virtues which every just man must possess he immediately added that all of these were united in Rabbi Jehudah and his family. These are: beauty, strength, honor, wisdom, a manly beard, old age and successful children.<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק ו׳ משנה ח׳־ט׳, ירושלמי סנהדרין י״א הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
People therefore believed that one who sees Rabbi Jehudah in his dream could expect wisdom,<sup class="footnote-marker">30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות נ״ז ב׳.</span></i> and later scholars declared that he drew his wisdom from deep wells<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבועות ז׳ א׳.</span></i> and that the prophet Elijah sat among the disciples of Rabbi Jehudah to hear him teach the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">32)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פ״ה ב׳.</span></i>
When he was asked “What is the right way which a man should chose?” Rabbi Jehudah replied that every way is good when it is fit for the people who follow it and men could pride themselves on it. To elucidate his meaning he immediately added: “Be careful in the case of a light commandment as in that of a weighty one for you know not the value of the commandments. Everyone must therefore weigh the loss incurred in fulfilling a commandment against its reward and the reward of a sin against its loss.”<sup class="footnote-marker">33)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק ב׳ משנה א׳.</span></i> “When a man commits a good deed he should be joyful, because it is certain to lead him to other good deeds, but one who commits a sin must feel sorrowful because he will be lead to commit other sins.”<sup class="footnote-marker">34)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ספרי פרשה ט״ו.</span></i>
Evil nature and its relation to the sinner, Rabbi Jehudah said, may be compared to two persons who enter a house and one of them is caught in the act of stealing. When the guilty person is asked, “Who was with you?” he could say that he was alone responsible but seeing that he was to be condemned to death he also involves his friend. Evil nature acts similarly and when one of man’s limbs sins and loses its share in the world to come all the other limbs are also lost.<sup class="footnote-marker">35)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אָבות דר׳ נתן פרק ט״ז.</span></i>
“One who enjoys the pleasures of this world,” Rabbi Jehudah continued, “is denied the pleasures of the world to come; one who is denied the joys of this world is certain to share in the pleasures of the world to come. A just man who meets with difficulties in this life may be compared to a cook who prepares a feast for himself: although he has to work hard to prepare the feast he has the realization that he will enjoy it later. Wicked men who meet with difficulties may be compared to a cook who prepares a feast for others; he has to work hard and he does not enjoy the fruit of his labor.”<sup class="footnote-marker">36)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק כ״ח.</span></i>
But it is remarkable that despite Rabbi’s conviction that all of man’s activities must be directed toward the attainment of a share in the world to come he nevertheless once expressed himself in the following terms: “One hour of repentance and good deeds in this world outweighs all the life in the world to come.”<sup class="footnote-marker">37)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות ד׳ י״ז.</span></i> This statement was interpreted to refer to the satisfaction that one derives from repentance or good deeds which is more important than the joy of anticipating a world to come.
Speaking of the Torah Rabbi compared it to water. Just as an adult is not ashamed to ask a child to give him water to drink even so should a man not be ashamed to ask one lesser than himself to clarify some doubtful passage of the law. The Torah may also be compared to water in another manner. One who is thirsty diligently searches for water to quench his thirst and a student must be diligent in his attendance at the academy.<sup class="footnote-marker">38)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קהלת רבה פּרשה ב׳.</span></i> No man can hide his learning and even if he engages in study secretly the Torah will announce itself to all.<sup class="footnote-marker">39)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן ט״ז ב׳.</span></i>
Because of his great veneration of the Torah and its followers Rabbi despised the uneducated and he declared that only students may eat the flesh of animals or fowls but the uneducated must not eat of it for they themselves are not different from the animals.<sup class="footnote-marker">40)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים מ״ט ב׳.</span></i> He believed that all evil which was visited upon the world was in punishment of the sins of the “Ame-Aratzim.”<sup class="footnote-marker">41)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא ה׳ א׳.</span></i>
Like many of his predecessors Rabbi Jehudah also believed in peace and he said that “even if the Jews were to worship idols but live in peace God himself would be powerless to harm them”.<sup class="footnote-marker">42)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פ׳ ל״ח.</span></i> He attached great significance to labor and declared: “Great is the value of labor. When people see a man who is not engaged in some occupation they wonder where he gets his income from. Such a man may be compared to an unmarried woman who adorns herself before going out into the street and thus attracts the unfavorable comment of the people. Similar attention is attracted by a man who does not work.”<sup class="footnote-marker">43)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אָבות דר׳ נתן פרק כ״א.</span></i>
After the daily prayers Rabbi Jehudah pronounced a prayer of his own in which he asked to be preserved from meeting with arrogant people and from showing arrogance and to be spared from untoward events, from evil thoughts, from wicked friends, from bad neighbors, from severe laws as well as from severe judges.<sup class="footnote-marker">44)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ט״ז ב׳.</span></i> Rabbi Jehudah was always ready to acknowledge the correctness of the views of others, but if one of his pupils corrected him in public, he never forgave him even though he may have agreed with the correction.<sup class="footnote-marker">45)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי חגיגה פרק ב׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
The following story is related in the Talmud concerning the kindness of Rabbi Jehudah. As he once sat in front of the synagogue of the Babylonians in Sephoris, a calf was led by to slaughter. The animal fawned upon Rabbi Jehudah and bleated pitifully as if asking him to save it from slaughter, but Rabbi Jehudah said to it: “I cannot save you. You must follow where you are led for you were created for the purpose of slaughter.” It was then announced in heaven that since Rabbi did not pity God’s creature, he was to be punished and Rabbi Jehudah suffered from tooth aches for thirteen years. Some time later his daughter saw an insect in the house and she wanted to kill it, but Rabbi Jehudah said to her: “Leave it be. God created it and He pities all his creatures.” It was then decided in heaven to have mercy on Rabbi Jehudah because he showed mercy to a living creature .<sup class="footnote-marker">46)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פ״ח א׳, בראשית רבה פּרשה ל״ג פּיסקא ג׳.</span></i>
When Rabbi Jehudah was about to die he commanded his children that the conduct of the house should not be altered in any manner. He then raised his hands heavenward and said: “Creator of the world, you know the truth. All my days I have devoted to the Torah and I have not enjoyed the pleasures of this life in the slightest measure.” As his death drew near the scholars declared a fast and fervently prayed to god. They also said that whoever would announce the death of Rabbi Jehudah was to be pierced with a sword. Later they sent Bar Kapara to see Rabbi Jehudah but when he arrived Rabbi Jehudah was dead. Bar Kapara rent his garments and returning to the academy he said: “Angels and men have contended for the Holy Ark but the angles triumped and the Ark was taken away.” He was then asked, “Is Rabbi Jehudah dead?” and Bar Kapara answered, “You have said it. I could not bring myself to utter the word.”<sup class="footnote-marker">47)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ק״ד א׳.</span></i>
Many of the stories of the activities of Rabbi Jehudah which are related in the Talmud and the Mishna mention an intimate friendship which existed between him and the Roman emperor Antoninus and it was said that the emperor often visited the house of Rabbi Jehudah through a secret tunnel which led from Rome to the house of the Nasi.(!) During these visits they engaged in friendly arguments concerning religious questions. The confidence of the emperor in the Nasi was said to be so great that he often asked Rabbi Jehudah’s advice in such matters as the succession to the Roman throne and his conduct toward his daughter who deviated from the ways of morality.
Most of these stories are related in Tractate Avoda Zara and as historical proof of their being based on fact we may cite the writings of the Christian Church-Father Hieronymus, who lived at a time when these events were still fresh in the memory of the people. Other historians, however, find it difficult to establish definitely which emperor was referred to. During the lifetime of Rabbi Jehudah there ruled two or three emperors who added the name Antoninus to their given names. But the personalities of none of these emperors fit the legendary description of a great friendship with the Jewish leader. Antoninus Pius, who was the first to ameliorate the condition of the Jews in Palestine, could not have been the hero of these legends because he was not a friend of the Jews despite the fact that he modified Hadrian’s decrees. Furthermore the period of his reign does not coincide with the period given in these legends either.
Still other historical commentators deny the truth of the legend and maintain that the growth of Christianity which then gained the friendship of some Roman emperors caused the Jews to ally themselves with the Roman opponents of Christianity and to fabricate the story of the friendship of the emperor. Some of those that recognize the factual basis of the legend claim that it concerned a Roman governor named Antoninus and not an emperor.
The legend continues to relate that there was a secret passage from the governor’s palace in Caesaria to the house of Rabbi Jehudah and that he was always accompanied on his visits by two slaves. Fearing that the slaves might disclose the secret of his friendship with the Nasi which might harm his status in Rome, the governor killed one of the slaves upon his arrival at the house of the Nasi and the other upon his return to the palace.
Antoninus objected to the presence of outsiders during his visits and when he once found Rabbi Chanina bar Chama in the house of the Nasi he asked in anger, “Who is this person?” Rabbi answered, “This is not a human being but an angel.” “If so,” Antoninus said, “let him go out and awaken my slave who is sleeping at the door.” Rabbi Chanina went out and with his prayers he caused the dead slave to come to life again.
Antoninus consulted Rabbi Jehudah concerning his family problems and in order that none may understand the subject under discussion they frequently conducted a “correspondence of flowers”. When Gira, the daughter of Antoninus, began to conduct herself immorally Antoninus sent to Rabbi Jehudah a herb named Gagira thus informing him of the situation and requesting his advice. Rabbi responded by sending a herb named Chusbarta to express his opinion that he was justified in killing her. In reply Antoninus sent a bloom named Karthi indicating his inability to execute a member of his family and Rabbi sent him a herb named Chasa to advise him that he should keep the whole matter secret.
Another time Antoninus sent the following message to Rabbi Jehudah: “The treasury is empty. Tell me what to do.” Rabbi Jehudah led the messenger into his garden and in his presence he pulled out some large radishes and planted small ones in their stead. When the messenger asked him for a reply, R. Jehudah said that none was needed. The messenger returned to Antoninus and reported that Rabbi Jehudah gave no answer to the question. “Did he do anything in your presence?” Antoninus asked and the messenger related what he had seen. Antoninus understood the hint and he discharged some officials and appointed others in their place. In a short time the royal treasury was again filled with gold.<sup class="footnote-marker">48)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ס״ז פּיסקא ו׳.</span></i>
Antoninus once said to Rabbi: “I would like to see my son Severus succeed me to the throne and I also want to make Tiberias a free city, but I can only do one of these two things and I don’t know which to choose.” Rabbi advised him to appoint Severus as his representative and he would later declare Tiberias a free city.
Several episodes related in the Talmud indicate that the relations between Antoninus and Rabbi were no longer kept secret after a while. It is told that Antoninus sought to serve Rabbi every time he visited him and when Rabbi was taking his place in the litter to be carried to the academy, Antoninus would bend down so that his back might serve as a step for Rabbi. When Rabbi Jehudah objected to this servility because it lowered the dignity of the royal office Antoninus remarked: “I wish that I could be as a rug under your feet in the world to come.” Antoninus also sent sacks full of gold to Rabbi and these he covered with wheat to hide from the populace the fact that he was giving money belonging to the government to the Nasi. Rabbi Jehudah said to him: “Why do you do this? I do not need it.” Antoninus replied: “Let it remain for those who will come after you and they can pass it on to future generations.” It is also told that Antoninus leased to Rabbi Jehudah two thousand acres of land in Palestine.<sup class="footnote-marker">49)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שביעית פרק ו׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
Some versions of this legend declare that Antoninus was converted to Judaism but this fact is contradicted in other places. Antoninus is reported to have remarked to Rabbi Jehudah: “You promise that in the world to come I will partake of the Leviathan but now you do not allow me to eat of the Paschal lamb.” Rabbi Jehudah pointed out that the uncircumcised were forbidden to eat of the Paschal lamb. Antoninus then underwent circumcision and it was said that when Messiah comes he would be in the front rank of the proselytes. Incidentally it was also told that Antoninus presented a “menorah” to the synagogue in Tiberias. When Rabbi heard of the gift he exclaimed: “Praised be God who inspired him with this idea!” The fact that he did not say, “Praised be <i>our</i> God!” was interpreted by some to prove that Antoninus had not embraced Judaism.<sup class="footnote-marker">50)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי מגלה פרק ג׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>
Antoninus frequently invited Rabbi Jehudah to his own house and Rabbi often arranged feasts in honor of Antoninus. At one such feast which took place on a Sabbath only cold food was offered. Antoninus ate the food and praised it highly. At another feast which was given on a week day hot victuals were served but Antoninus declared that the cold foods that were offered on the Sabbath were tastier. Rabbi Jehudah explained that the hot food did not contain a certain herb which was mixed with the cold food. When Antoninus asked in surprise what that herb was, Rabbi said that it was named “Sabbath”.<sup class="footnote-marker">51)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה י״א פיסקא ב׳.</span></i>
Antoninus often engaged Rabbi in philosophic and religious discussions during which he asked questions such as: “Whence does man derive his soul?” or “Since when does evil nature rule humanity?” Ofttimes he was not satisfied with the replies of Rabbi Jehudah and offered his own explanations which Rabbi admitted to be correct.<sup class="footnote-marker">52)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין צ״א ב׳.</span></i>
During one of these discussions Antoninus argued that both body and soul may escape punishment on the day of judgment. The body may claim that it could not sin if it had not been imbued with a soul and the soul could reason likewise. Rabbi Jehudah explained what could be done in such a case with the following example from human behavior: The owner of a garden hired two watchmen, one of whom was blind and the other lame, to guard the fruit. The lame one saw the fruit on the trees and he desired to eat of them. He then said to the blind watchman, “Lead me to the tree and we will both eat the most beautiful fruit.” The blind man then carried the lame one on his shoulders and they ate all the fruit. Later the owner of the garden arrived and he asked: “Who ate all the fruit of the tree?” The blind man said: “You cannot blame me for you know that I cannot see.” The lame watchman similarly declared: “You cannot blame me for I could not walk to the tree.” The owner then placed the lame one on the back of the blind one to show them that he understood how they reached the fruit and he punished them. God does likewise when body and soul attempt to escape punishment by placing the blame on the other.
When Antoninus died Rabbi Jehudah sighed and exclaimed sorrowfully: “Society has now broken down.”
The greatest achievement of Rabbi Jehudah which immortalized his influence and gave him a place in our history almost rivalling that of Moses was his editing of the Mishna in which he compiled all the laws and customs of Jewish life as they were then accepted by the people orally as interpretations and supplements to the commandments of the Torah. The traditional oral explanations were handed down from one generation to another by the priests, the Levites and the scholars. These laws and opinions were never systematically written down in order to prevent their rivalling the sanctity of the Scriptures but single scholars kept short notes of what they heard from their teachers and these notes circulated extensively until they were gathered and edited by Rabbi Jehudah. Many of these traditional interpretations were accepted as legally binding as early as the time of Simeon the Just but during the years they were amplified and developed until there arose differences of opinion which seemed contradictory.
The first Mishna of tractate Berachoth thus begins with a question: “At what time does one have to recite the Shema?” The Mishna expresses no doubt regarding the necessity of reciting the Shema, but is merely concerned with the length of time allowed for this prayer. The majority of the laws and customs cited in the Mishna are not referred to any one person. It was considered irrelevant who the original author of a basically accepted law had been. As the years went by the names of these authors were often forgotten and the Mishna merely endeavored to establish the origin of the laws in the scriptural texts deriving them literally or through exposition.
Throughout the centuries that elapsed from the time of Simeon the Just until the days of Rabbi Jehudah many scholars were killed and with them the distinct knowledge of many laws was lost. Numerous customs also lapsed in the course of time. The remaining scholars would then assemble witnesses to testify concerning doubtful interpretations of laws and the manner of their observance. In compiling the Mishna Rabbi Jehudah sought to achieve a similar goal.
The persecutions which mounted through the ages severed the Jews from contact with the surrounding environment and forced them into the narrow bounds of their own intimate group life thus blinding them to what was going on outside. They then devoted all their spiritual energies to the Torah; they reckoned every word and letter in the Torah and surrounded even minor words and seemingly unnecessary letters with numerous interpretations.
These interpretations and elucidations were called Mishna because it was a more complete and improved code of laws for the conduct of mankind. Many of the Biblical commandments were rather vague in their context and required further elucidation. Nevertheless when Rabbi Jehudah compiled the Mishna in six “orders” which were divided into sixty tractates there remained some laws which were not included for some reason unknown to us and these were later included in the Talmud as Boraitha or in Tosephta. The Mishnaic method of interpretation thus became the nerve center of Jewish jurisprudence and the Jerusalem Talmud explains<sup class="footnote-marker">53)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים פרק ד׳ הלכה א׳, מגלה פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> even where tradition and the Biblical text were contradictory it was sought to find some way to derive the tradition from the text in order not to impair the sanctity of the Scriptural text. Actions which were forbidden at one time were permitted at a later date but both the prohibition and the permission were derived by expounding the same text. A case in question involved the time when cultivation of the fields on the year preceding the Sabbatical year had to cease.<sup class="footnote-marker">54)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שביעית פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
This approach was maintained toward all laws irrespective of whether they were based on traditional interpretation or on the regulations of the Elders which were enacted from time to time since the days of the Great Synagogue. A similar attitude was observed toward customs which became hallowed by time and which were originated by the teachers of the law or were commanded by the Torah. The Mishna did not differentiate between these two types of laws.
Much has been said concerning the difference between the schools of Hillel and of Shammai and that for a time it seemed as if two separate sets of laws would be established. Such fears, however, could be entertained only by the superficial observer for despite all differences both schools had but one aim, to attain the truth.
As Rabbi Jehudah grew old he felt concerned for the fate of the traditions and he feared that they would be forgotten by later generations. He therefore decided to have them written down and edited. He entertained no such fears concerning the Torah and he felt sure that its spirit would remain alive even if the books of the Torah were to be destroyed. The constant oppression and the weakening human spirit did inspire him with foreboding concerning the observance of the numerous traditions.
As Rabbi Jehudah gathered the various laws to include in the Mishna he omitted the explanatory arguments and conflicting opinions which had been added. He also sought to retain the original style and form of the laws and he included laws and customs which were no longer observed in his day. All these he tried to present in the clearest possible manner.<sup class="footnote-marker">55)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קל״ט א׳.</span></i> The Mishna thus bears the marks of organic unity despite the many disputes which took place during the formulation of the laws and it appears as if written by one man. Any contradiction which may be found in it were considered to be superficial because “everything which a scholar may learn someday had previously been said to Moses on Mount Sinai.”<sup class="footnote-marker">56)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי חגיגה פרק א׳ הלכה ח׳.</span></i>
The Mishnaioth (pl. of Mishna) of Rabbi Jehudah could be classified under two headings: Halacha (law) and Drasha (exposition). The word Halacha signifies “conduct” and it refers to traditionally accepted customs irrespective of whether they are based on Biblical commandments in their essence or in detail. It was an accepted axiom of the Jewish faith that all of these Halachoth were orally given to Moses on Mount Sinai. Differences of opinion which existed regarding some of these, were settled by a “Bath Kol” (public opinion) which declared that the contentions of both sides were the words of the living God.<sup class="footnote-marker">57)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין י״ג ב׳.</span></i>
The Graeco Jewish philosopher Philo described in his books the customs of the Jews and he defined these customs (<span dir="rtl">מנהגים</span>) as unwritten traditional interpretations of the laws. From this we may conclude that the origin of an Halacha was a popular custom. In time, however, laws and customs became differentiated into separate types of observances. When we assume that custom was the foundation of law we must bear in mind that customs become antiquated and lose their original purpose. We therefore find in the Mishna numerous laws whose intent is no longer clear. In such cases it was the established rule of the court to observe the accepted procedure of the populace. A rule was established that customs which are contradictory to old laws should not be abolished and it was said that “custom outweighs the law”.<sup class="footnote-marker">58)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי יבמות פרק י״ב הלכה א׳.</span></i> Another rule declared that “a person may be punished for the infraction of a custom as well as for breaking a law.”<sup class="footnote-marker">59)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי פסחים פרק ד׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
The laws of the Mishna developed to a large extent out of analysis of the words of the Torah. This method was then considered to be the most valid and the only one capable of bringing out the simple meaning of the text. The Biblical verse “on the morrow after the Sabbath” (Lev. 23:15) was thus explained to mean the morrow of the first day of Passover and not the morrow of the Sabbath as the Sadducees claimed. The interpretation of the Sadducees would cause Shavuoth to occur on a Sunday always. Similarly they explained the Biblical injunction that a man must marry the childless widow of his brother to be operative only if the woman had no children at all despite the text of the Bible which reads “if he has no son”. These two interpretations must have been accepted long before the compilation of the Mishna because the Septuaginta, the Greek translation of the Torah, rendered these verses in accordance with the Mishnaic explanation.
After the destruction of the temple this method of exposition gained in popularity and every word was minutely analyzed. The seven rules of interpretation which Hillel the Old set up increased in time to thirteen (formulated by Rabbi Ishmael) and later they were expanded by Rabbi Jose of Galilee to 32. Rabbi Akiba attached significance to every word and letter in the Bible. A contributing factor which influenced this form of reasoning was the fact that the text of the Bible was then written without vowel signs. Although everyone knew the traditionally correct reading of the text tradition was frequently overlooked and the ambiguity which the lack of vowel signs caused gave ground to interpretations contrary to the spirit of the text.
When Rabbi Jehudah began to compile the Mishna, two generations had passed since the first tractate “Eduyoth” was composed. In the intervening time many laws developed along new lines due to historical developments which could not have been foreseen. Rabbi Jehudah carefully weighed all the pros and cons concerning all laws before he determined their final form. Although he used the Mishna of Rabbi Akiba extensively he did not include all the laws listed in it because his decisions were based on the opinions of the majority of his contemporary scholars. He also changed the order of Rabbi Akiba’s Mishnayoth which arranged the laws according to their authors and not according to subject matter.
Rabbi Jehudah arranged the Mishna according to subject groups. The first group dealt with prayers and benedictions; the second dealt with the laws of cultivation of the soil and the attendant regulations; the third dealt with the regulations governing the observance of the Sabbath and the holidays, fast days and other historical memorial days; the fourth group included laws pertaining to family life, vows and Nazarites; the fifth dealt with money matters, the Sanhedrin and relations between man and the community; the sixth included the laws of the sacrifices and the regulations of cleanliness. But Rabbi Jehudah was not altogether successful in classifying the material as he wished. The great volume of subject matter at hand could not easily be made to conform with rigid classifications and we thus find problems of money matters among the laws of marriage or the regulations of the holidays; dietary laws are frequently found among regulations pertaining to the offering of sacrifices.
Historians differ as to the motives which prompted Rabbi Jehudah to compile the Mishna. Some maintain that he undertook the work in order to preserve the traditions from being lost. Others claim that his primary motive was to define the laws once and for all and to remove any possible ambiguities. Such conflicting opinions as are found in the Mishna or cases where the final decision concerning a law was not laid down these historians explain as being additions of a later day.
The Halacha, which constitutes the greater part of the Mishna, is accompanied by all the arguments which were advanced concerning the law as well as by the fundamental cause which brought about the enactment of the law, which was often derived from scriptural text which had no direct bearing on that law. In explanation of this view the Talmud states that Rabbi Jochanan ben Zakkai studied the disputes of Abayei and Rava<sup class="footnote-marker">60)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוכה כ״ח א׳.</span></i> implying that he foresaw the possible future argumentation of these two scholars. Since Rabbi Jochanan lived nearly two hundred years before Abayei and Rava no other view may be taken of this statement.
The second important component of the Mishna is the Drasha (exposition) which consists of interpretations of words to substantiate the opinions of the Tana. These Drashoth (pl. of Drasha) are generally preceded by the words “I am instructed to say” (<span dir="rtl">תלמוד לומר</span>) or “it is intended to teach you” (<span dir="rtl">ללמדך</span>). It is noteworthy, however, that in some cases the law is stated at once in its final form while at other times all the interpretations of the words and even of the letters are quoted.
The Mishna was written in Hebrew which was slightly modified from the language of the Bible. Because of the practical problems with which it concerned itself it had to depart from the poetic idiom of the Scriptures and in order to express the numerous new concepts words had to be borrowed from the languages which were then currently spoken in Palestine such as Chaldean, Aramaeic, Greek and Latin. The foreign words that were introduced into the Mishna were modified to conform to the spirit and the grammar of the Hebrew language. The same words were not always used to define one concept because the editor of the Mishna sought to retain the original idiom of the Tana who expounded the law and these employed the idioms that were current in their time. The style of the Mishna illustrates Rabbi Jehudah’s keen sense for the Hebrew language. In his own household Hebrew was spoken exclusively and to determine the correct spoken form of some Hebrew word many went to hear the servant of Rabbi Jehudah speak. The Hebrew language was still the spoken tongue of the majority of the Jews and it was flexible enough to express the finest abstract concepts.
It is impossible to point out those Halachoth in the Mishna which were quoted from the original statements and those which Rabbi Jehudah phrased in his own words. Only a skilled philologist could recognize the stylistic nuances between the original statements and those which were rephrased. The beginning of every book of the Mishna quotes the most important laws of the group dealt with. It is therefore assumed that these are quotations from earlier Tanaim and are given in their original wording with the name of the Tana omitted. This is also the case when the authorship of the Tana was acknowledged. However there are statements in the Mishna that are ascribed to certain Tanaim which are recognizable as not being direct quotations. In such cases Rabbi Jehudah was probably more interested in the essence of the opinion rather than in its exact wording.
There are indications that the text of the Mishna underwent modification during the lifetime of Rabbi Jehudah. Some of these were probably made by Rabbi Jehudah himself. This may account for the different version of the Mishna which sometimes occurs in the Jerusalem Talmud. Others claim that the text of the Mishna as it is quoted in the Babylonian Talmud is its final form and it was brought to Babylonia by Rav (Aba Arecha) after Rabbi Jehudah introduced improvements. We may also be justified in assuming that certain changes were introduced into the Mishna after the death of Rabbi Jehudah. As a result of these changes a number of corrections were made by various scholars who understood that it was impossible to preserve the original text of the Mishna without variations. The tendency to change the text is evidenced by the warning of Rabbi Jochanan (the editor of the Jerusalem Talmud) who said: “No one may add to the language which the early ones used.”<sup class="footnote-marker">61)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי נזיר פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> Other scholars warned against confusing the names of the Tanaim and ascribing a saying of one Tana to another. Such errors, they said, amounted to committing the sin of “changing eternal boundaries.”<sup class="footnote-marker">62)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ספרי פּ׳ כי תצא.</span></i>
The following story is characteristic of the attitude toward changing the text of the Mishna. Levi ben Sisi once asked Rabbi Jehudah to improve a certain sentence in the Mishna and Rabbi Jehudah was angered with him for making such a request. Levi nevertheless changed the text as he saw fit.<sup class="footnote-marker">63)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ט׳ א׳, י׳ א׳.</span></i> Others no doubt followed the example af Levi, for we frequently find in the Jerusalem Talmud the statement, “we studied the Mishna in this form” or “there are those who study it otherwise”. It is evident that in all these cases changes had been introduced.
This practice was later engaged in by the Amoraim when they found that the Mishna conflicted with the views they were trying to prove, and the corrections remained permanent despite the accepted rule against introducing changes. This practice was more prevalent in Babylonia because “pilpul” was more popular in that country. Sometimes these changes were not incorporated into the body of the Mishna and we thus find the Jerusalem Talmud use the phrase: “The Mishna should have read otherwise”.
Taking all these into consideration we may conclude that the text of the Mishna often caused misunderstandings among the scholars who failed to comprehend the original meaning. The introduction of changes continued for a long time until the Talmud was ready to be compiled. Conflicting versions became popular and Rabbi Zeira (a pupil of Rabbi Jochanan) complained that indifference was shown to the original text of Rabbi Jehudah.<sup class="footnote-marker">64)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי מעשר שני פרק ח׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> In addition the Talmud declares that some sentences in the Mishna were not inserted by Rabbi Jehudah.<sup class="footnote-marker">65)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מנחות ק״ד ב׳.</span></i>

Contemporaries of Rabbi Jehuda haNasi

There was an entire group of scholars who lived and exerted an influence during the lifetime of Rabbi Jehudah but who conducted independent academies and frequently even opposed Rabbi Jehudah. This group marked the transition from the Tanaim who lived after the completion of the Mishna to the Amoraim, who were the authors of the Gemara.
Rabbi Simeon ben Menasia belonged to this group of transition scholars. He was a member of a society of pious men who were called “The Holy Congregation” because of their habit of dividing the day into three parts one of which they devoted to learning, the second to prayer and the third to work. Other members of this society divided the year into two parts; the winter they devoted to study and the summer to labor in their trades. It was this group that Rabbi Jehudah had in mind when he declared that “man should gain the knowledge of an occupation as well as knowledge of the Torah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קהלת רבה פּרשה ט׳ פיסקא ז׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Simeon was a disciple of Rabbi Meir and he always quoted his master in legal matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות י״ד ב׳, בבא מציעא ק״ו ב׳.</span></i> Some of his references to Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai indicate that he had studied with him also.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק ו׳ משנה ח׳.</span></i> Rabbi Menasia was diligent in spreading the praise of Rabbi Jehudah despite the fact that he at times disagreed with his opinions.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ביצה כ״ו א׳.</span></i> He listed seven virtues which every pious man must possess and he immediately added that Rabbi Jehudah and his family combined all of these in their personalities.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי סנהדרין פרק י״א הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Simon b. Menaisa’s sense of justice is expressed in his dictum concerning the proper conduct of a judge during trial. He declared that a judge must endeavor to conciliate the contending parties before he has heard their grievances or before he had made up his mind which of them had justice on his side. But after he had heard their arguments and had decided which of them was right and which was wrong he no longer had the right to attempt conciliation and had to pass sentence.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ו׳ ב׳, תוספתא סנהדרין פרק א׳.</span></i>
Concerning the Sabbath Rabbi Simeon b. Menasia said that the Biblical verse “Behold I have given you the Sabbath” indicates that the people have the right to regulate the Sabbath more than the Sabbath should regulate their lives. He therefore concluded that it was permissible to desecrate the Sabbath once to save a human life in order that the person might live to observe many Sabbaths in the future.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא פ״ה ב׳.</span></i>
A fantastic remark of Rabbi Simeon ben Menasia concerning the punishment of the original sin was interpreted by some as ridiculing those scholars who believed that God sent angels to cut off the feet of the snake after Adam ate of the fruit of the tree of knowledge. Rabbi Simeon b. Menasia said: “It is rgerettable that we have lost an excellent servant in the snake. Had Eve not been led to sin the snake would not have been cursed and every Jew could keep two snakes in his house one of which he could sent to the East and the other to the West. The snake could then have brought him diamonds and other wealth from the ends of the earth and none could have harmed him. Snakes could also have been used for all kinds of labor instead of camels and asses; in addition snakes could have carried the fertilizer into the gardens.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין נ״ט ב׳, אבות דר׳ נתן פרק א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair was another contemporary of Rabbi Jehudah. According to the Talmud he was the son-in-law of Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai; but according to the Zohar, he was his father-in-law. In mental brilliance Rabbi Pinchas was the equal of Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai and it was said that whenever Rabbi Simeon asked a question during their studies Rabbi Pinchas immediately had twelve answers; when Rabbi Pinchas asked some question Rabbi Simeon at once answered it in twenty-four different ways.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ל״ג ב׳.</span></i>
But Rabbi Pinchas gained his reputation not because of his scholastic attainments but because of his piety concerning which many wonderful stories were related. The Talmud therefore contains no legal opinions of Rabbi Pinchas but much was told of his painstaking care in observing the commandment of offering tithes to such an extent that even his ass would not eat grain which had not been tithed. Although he declared that the city of Ashkelon was not included in the boundaries of Palestine and should therefore have been considered free from the commandment of offering tithes, he nevertheless insisted that Jews who lived in that city must abide by this commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספתא אהלות פרק י״ח.</span></i> His belief in the significance of this commandment was so great that he ascribed all punishment which was visited on people as being caused by avoiding the offering of tithes.
It is thus related that he once came to a city where the people complained of a plague of mice which were eating up the harvest. Rabbi Pinchas warned them against shirking the offering of tithes and when the inhabitants of that city began to pay closer attention to the fulfillment of this commandment they were rid of the mice. Another time some people came to him and complained that the city well did not yield enough water. Rabbi Pinchas said: “This is certainly a punishment for your disregarding the tithes.” The people vowed to change their ways and the well began to yield sufficient water for all their needs.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי דמאי פרק א׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Pinchas’ ass was said to be able to discern which grain had been tithed and which had not. When it was stolen, it refused to eat for three days. The thieves realized that it would starve to death and they released it, whereupon it returned to its master. Rabbi Pinchas was glad to get his animal back and he commanded that it be fed at once, but when some barley was offered to it the ass recognized that the barley had not been tithed and refused to eat. Rabbi Pinchas’ pupils then said to him: “Did you not teach us that in doubtful cases it is unnecessary to offer tithes from grain which is to be fed to animals?” and Rabbi Pinchas answered: “What can you do to this animal which insists on the strict observance of the law?”<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שקלים פרק ה׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i><sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">Similar stories concerning an ass which refused to eat of grain that had not been tithed have been related about the ass of R. Chanina ben Dosa.</i>
Rabbi Pinchas listed a number of human virtues, each of which grows out of the preceding one and leads ever higher to the final stage of perfection. Observance leads to modesty, modesty leads to fear of God, fear of God leads to piety, piety leads to the holy spirit and the holy spirit leads to resurrection.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה כ׳ ב׳, ירושלמי שקלים פרק ג׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
Another time Rabbi Pinchas complained about the low moral state of the Jewish people and he declared that since the destruction of the temple scholars are shamed and decent people go about with bowed heads; the desire to do good deeds is weakened and men of strong arms and arrogant tongues have gained the upper hand. Nevertheless no one wishes for anything, for all things have lost their worth and any man who is dissatisfied may only look to God.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה מ״ט א׳.</span></i>
The Talmud relates that on one of his journeys to redeem captives Rabbi Pinchas came to a river named Ginai and he could not cross it because there was no bridge nor boat at hand. He then addressed the river: “Make way that I may cross!”, but the river answered: “You are about to do the will of the Creator and I always do His will, but you are not certain whether your journey will be successful while my path has been laid out by God. I therefore need not change my course.” Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair commanded: “If you will not make way for me I will decree that your sources be dried.” Upon hearing this threat the river was frightened and at once made a path for Rabbi Pinchas.
Then there came a man who carried a sack of Passover wheat on his back. Rabbi Pinchas commanded the river to let this man also pass because he was on his way to fulfill a commandment. This time the river parted its waters at once. Meanwhile there came a wanderer who joined the other two and Rabbi Pinchas again asked the river to let the wanderer pass so that it might not be said that a companion of his was discriminated against and the river parted its waters for the third time.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין ז׳ א׳.</span></i>
When the disciples of Rabbi Pinchas heard of this occurrence they asked their master whether they would ever be able to perform the same miracle and he replied: “If you will feel certain that you never harmed a Jew nor shamed any person you will be able to perform the same.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי דמאי פרק א׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
It is further related that Rabbi Pinchas never ate at a stranger’s table and that after he grew of age he did not even eat at his father’s table. When Rabbi Jehudah once heard that he had arrived in the city he invited him to dine with him and Rabbi Pinchas accepted the invitation. Rabbi Jehudah was overjoyed at this and openly showed his gladness. Seeing Rabbi Jehudah’s joyful expression Rabbi Pinchas said: “You seem to think that I had vowed not to derive any benefit from Jews but the situation is entirely different. It is true that Jews are a holy people, but there are some who would gladly give you food but have none while others have enough but do not want to share it. I therefore decided never to take any food that was offered to me.”
When Rabbi Pinchas reached the door of Rabbi Jehudah’s house he saw there two white mules and he exclaimed: “The angel of death is in this house, how can I eat here?” (His reference to the mules as the angel of death is explained by the fact that the people of that time believed, that a blow of a white mule could never be healed.)
As Rabbi Jehudah heard the exclamation of Rabbi Pinchas, he came out of the house and said: “If you are not satisfied that I keep white mules I will sell them.”
“You must not do so,” Rabbi Pinchas replied, “for that would amount to putting a stone in the way of a blind man that he may stumble on it.”
“Then I will disclaim ownership of the animals so that anyone may take them, that you may come into my house,” Rabbi Jehudah continued.
“You must not do so either because of the loss that you will suffer,” Rabbi Pinchas responded.
“In that case I will have their hooves removed that they may harm no one,” Rabbi Jehudah urged.
“If you do so you will commit the sin of causing suffering to an animal,” Rabbi Pinchas objected.
“Then I will kill the mules that you may enter my house,” Rabbi said.
“You must not do so either,” Rabbi Pinchas said, “for it is against the law to damage objects of value.”
In the end Rabbi Pinchas did not enter the Nasi’s house and since that time the two became estranged and never met again.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין ז׳ ב׳.</span></i>
The Tana Rabbi Eleazar Hakapar who was also a contemporary of Rabbi Jehudah was famous for his saying that “envy, desire and ambition drive a man out of the world.” He also declared that “those that are born are destined to die, the dead are destined to rebirth, the reborn are to be judged; to know, to make known and to be aware that God is the Creator, the Discerner, the judge and the witness, the plaintiff and the highest authority at the trial. In His presence there is neither injustice nor forgetfulness, nor respect of persons nor taking of bribes. All is according to reckoning. Let not your nature persuade you that the grave will be a refuge, for against your will you were created and against your will you were born, against your will you live and against your will you must die and give account and reckoning before the King of Kings.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק ד׳ משנה כ״א, כ״ב.</span></i>
In his warning against pride Rabbi Eleazar Hakapar said: “You must not strive to be like the highest stair but rather like a doorstep upon which everyone treads, for when the house is being destroyed the doorstep remains in place to the very end.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק כ״ו.</span></i>
Like other contemporaries of Rabbi Jehudah whose names did not appear in the Mishna despite the fact that they were considered to be authorities in legal questions, Rabbi Eleazar Hakapar also figures in the Boraitha only.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קל״ה א׳, חולין פּ״ד ב׳.</span></i> There are grounds to believe that Rabbi Eleazar’s father was also a learned man, for we find Rabbi Eleazar referred to as Rabbi Eleazar ben Rabbi and Rashi interprets this to indicate that his father was held to be a great man. Rabbi Eleazar Hakapar had a son named Eliezer. Historians are confused concerning the identity of this son; some say he was the well-known Bar Kapara while others maintain that these two are names of the same person. We thus find some statements in the Talmud attributed sometime to one and on other occasions to the other. This confusion of names is ascribed by some Talmudists to the editors of the Talmud.
We find a clear indication of the economic conditions of that time in Rabbi Eleazar Hakapar’s statement that “a man must constantly pray to God to preserve him from poverty.” Rabbi Eleazar was convinced that poverty was bound to affect every family and that if one was spared the anguish of poverty his sons or grandsons were sure to be affected by it.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קנ״א ב׳.</span></i>
Because of the great development of Jewish religious life in Babylonia there were many scholars who feared that in time that country would become a serious competitor to Palestine similar to the case of Alexandria generations earlier. Rabbi Eleazar therefore declared that “all the synagogues and academies of Babylonia will in the end. be transported to Palestine.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה כ״ט א׳.</span></i> Like his contemporaries he also valued peace because “all the benedictions of the Shmone Esrei end with the blessing of peace.”<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ספרי נשא פּ׳ קמ״ד.</span></i>
During a discussion concerning these virtues of the Jews which gained for them their redemption from Egypt, Rabbi Eleazar declared that this was due to the fact that “they avoided immorality and slander and did not change their language.”<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכילתא פּרשת בא פּיסקא ד׳.</span></i> This statement was a sharp protest against the conduct of many Jews of that time who reported one another to the authorities and who abandoned the Hebrew language in favor of Greek.
* * *
Bar Kapara was a contemporary of Rabbi Eleazar Hakapar. Despite the contention of some Talmudic critics that both Rabbi Eleazar and Bar Kapara are the same person we can not assume this point of view because we find in the Talmud a dispute between these two concerning the regulations of slaughtering fowl. Rabbi Eleazar declared that the regulations governing slaughter were introduced by the Rabbis while Bar Kapara maintained that they were a commandment of the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין כ״ז ב׳.</span></i> The true name of Bar Kapara has not been definitely established. “Yochasin” calls him Simeon, “Aruch” refers to him as Eleazar and the Midrash mentions his name as Aba.<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קהלת רבה פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא ד׳.</span></i> Others explain this ambiguity as due to the fact that he was named after his father who died before the son was born.
Bar Kapara compiled a collection of laws, but these did not become as popular as the Mishnaioth of Rabbi Jehudah and many of them were lost in time. Of the remainder only a few were included in the Talmud as Boraithas and these were always introduced by the words “Bar Kapara taught.” But it must be borne in mind that Bar Kapara’s opinions were highly respected among the students of the academies and they were called the Mishna of Bar Kapara.<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא קנ״ד ב׳, ירושלמי הוריות פרק ג׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>
Aside from his prominence in Halacha Bar Kapara was famous for his expositions and his clever interpretations and deductions from Biblical passages were repeated in the academies of Palestine and Babylonia. The following are some examples of his aphorisms and treatment of Biblical texts:
In Isaiah (9:6) we find an exceptional case where a final “mem” is used in the middle of a word. What could we conclude from this? God had decided to make king Hezekiah the Messiah and to transform the wars of Sanherib into the wars of Gog and Magog. The “Midath Hadin” (emanation of justice) thereupon said to Him: “Creator of the world! Why would you do so? King David sang your praise and You did not make him Messiah. You have already performed many miracles for Hezekiah, You saved him from Sanherib and You healed him of his sickness. Why should You give him this additional honor?” God’s will was thus frustrated. The earth then said to God: “I will sing your praise instead of Hezekiah but appoint him Your Messiah,” but this was not accepted. The angel in charge of the whole world (<span dir="rtl">שר העולם</span>) then proclaimed: “Creator of the world! Do as you see fit,” and a Bath Kol announced: “This is my secret! This is my secret!”<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין צ״ד א׳.</span></i>
In one of his lectures he hinted that man must always be ready to give account of his deeds in the following manner: “A woman whose husband went on frequent journeys always adorned herself in her best garments. Seeing this her neighbors said to her: ‘Your husband is not at home, why do you adorn yourself?’ and she replied: ‘My husband is a sailor and as soon as he will earn something he will return home. It is therefore possible that he will arrive at any moment and it is best that he should find me adorned to meet him.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קהלת רבה פּרשה ט׳ פּיסקא ו׳.</span></i>
The following are noteworthy among Bar Kapara’s maxims:
“Love peace and despise disputes. Beware of anger, for anger will lead you to sin.”<sup class="footnote-marker">30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">דרך ארץ זוטא פרק ט׳.</span></i>
“He who honors his neighbor because of his wealth will in the end part from him in shame, but he who shames his friend for the sake of the fulfillment of a commandment will in the end part from him in honor.”<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק כ״ט.</span></i>
“The activities of just men are of more importance than the creation of the earth and sky.”<sup class="footnote-marker">32)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ה׳ א׳.</span></i>
“An angry man possesses nothing except his anger.”<sup class="footnote-marker">33)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין מ״א א׳.</span></i>
Many anecdotes were current in the academies of Palestine and Babylonia concerning the relations between Bar Kapara and the family of the Nasi Rabbi Jehudah. We have previously related how Bar Kapara persuaded Ben Elasha, the wealthy but dull son-in-law of Rabbi Jehudah, to propose a riddle, to the guests assembled at a feast, which criticised the conduct of Nasi. It was also related that every time that Rabbi Jehudah laughed some punishment was visited upon the world. But since Rabbi was frequently laughing at the witticisms of Bar Kapara he one day offered Bar Kapara forty measures of wheat if he would remain serious on that day. Bar Kapara thereupon brought a great basket smeared with tar and turning it upside down he asked Rabbi to fill it with grain. Another time Bar Kapara made a bet with Rabbi’s daughter that he would succeed in causing her father to sing and her mother to dance for him. The following day he attained his aim by a clever stratagem. Ben Elasha, who was present, resented the fact that his father-in-law did everything that Bar Kapara wanted him to do and together with his wife he left the house in displeasure.<sup class="footnote-marker">34)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדרים נ׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Despite the fact that he was not ordained, Bar Kapara was the teacher of nearly all the members of the first generation of Amoraim. Of Bar Kapara’s private life we only know that he was poor and that he gained his livelihood from manual labor. There exist vague hints that he was occupied in some work on a small rocky island in the sea.
It is told that Bar Kapara once had a dream which he told to Rabbi Jehudah and asked him to interpret it. In his dream he saw his nose fall off his face. Rabbi Jehudah declared that it was a sign that God had been angry with him but that now the anger had passed. Another time he dreamed that his hands were cut off and Rabbi Jehudah explained it as a sign that he would no longer have to work with hands for his sustenance.<sup class="footnote-marker">35)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות נ״ז א׳.</span></i>
A legend relates that Bar Kapara once saw a ship sink and only one of its passengers was saved from drowning. He pitied the man and took him into his house where he gave him food and some money. Years later some Jews were taken captive and Bar Kapara was sent to ransom them with the sum of 500 ducats. When Bar Kapara arrived at the palace he found the man whom he had saved and he discovered that this man was a high official of the government.
When the man saw Bar Kapara he ran to greet him and asked him what his mission was. Bar Kapara told him that he had come to ransom the captive Jews and he showed him the money that he had brought, but the man said to him: “You may keep this money instead of the five Shekolim which you gave me and because you gave me food and drink I will free your brothers without ransom.”<sup class="footnote-marker">36)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קהלת רבד פּרשה י״א פּיסקא א׳.</span></i><sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">A similar story of a shipwrecked noble who was saved by a Tana is told concerning Rabbi Eleazar ben Shamua.</i>
Since that time Bar Kapara’s situation improved and he could easily provide for his household as well as feed a number of students at his table.<sup class="footnote-marker">37)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ל״ט א׳.</span></i>

Rabbi Chiya Rabah bar Aba

R<small>ABBI</small> C<small>HIYA BAR</small> A<small>BA THE FIRST,</small> usually referred to in the Talmud as Rabbi Chiya (without his patronymic) or Rabbi Chiya Rabah (the great),<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ל״ח ב׳.</span></i> to distinguish him from Rabbi Chiya bar Aba the second who was an “Amora,” was a colleague and a pupil of Rabbi Jehudah and his influence was exerted after the Mishna had been completed preceding the beginning of the epoch of the Amoraim. Rabbi Chiya was born in a town near Sura in Babylonia about 190 years after the destruction of the temple. Some said that his family was descended from Shephatiah, the son of king David,<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי תענית פרק ד׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i> while others traced its origin to Shimei, the brother of king David. A passage in the Talmud relates that Rabbi Jehudah wanted to marry his son to the daughter of Rabbi Chiya and just before the ceremony of the wedding the bride suddenly died. Rabbi Jehudah considered this to be a sign from heaven and he suspected some fault in Rabbi Chiya’s family. The origins of the two families were investigated and it was discovered that Rabbi Jehudah was descended from Shephatiah ben Avital, while Rabbi Chiya was descended from Shimei, the brother of king David.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ס״ב ב׳.</span></i>
Little is known of the youth of Rabbi Chiya, even as little is known of the other Babylonian scholars who lived in his time. It appears that the Jews of Babylonia maintained great academies, for when Rabbi Chiya arrived in Palestine together with his sons, they were already well versed in the Torah. Since they never visited Palestine previously they must have gained their knowledge in academies in Babylonia.
The statement of the Talmud that “when the Torah was once forgotten Ezra came from Babylonia and renewed it then came Hillel the Babylonian and renewed it again,” which is followed by “when the Torah was again forgotten Rabbi Chiya came with his sons and they renewed and expanded it,” therefore appears incomprehensible.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוכה כ׳ א׳.</span></i> When Rabbi Chiya arrived in Palestine, learning was at a high level of development. Rabbi Jehudah was “Nasi” and he had many disciples so that there could hardly be any talk of the Torah being forgotten. The family of the Nasi occupied the undisputed leadership of the people and even had learning been at a low ebb the Nasi would not have allowed a recent arrival from Babylonia to become the “savior” of the situation.
However, there is no doubt of the fact that Rabbi Chiya was an important figure in Jewish life. He often lectured at the door of the Nasi<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ל״ד א׳.</span></i> and when his colleagues spoke of him they referred to him as “the lion of the company.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״א ב׳, סנהדרין ח׳ א׳.</span></i>
Characteristic of the determination not to allow learning to die down is the following statement of Rabbi Chiya who said: “If the Torah were to be forgotten, I would take flax and weave nets with which I would capture deer. The flesh of the deer I would give to the orphans and from the skins I would make parchment on which to write the Torah. Then I would go to cities where there are no teachers; I would have the five books of the Torah written down and I would teach them to the children; later I would teach them the six orders of the Mishna. All that I would do to prevent the Torah from being forgotten.” When Rabbi Jehudah heard of this he said: “See what great deeds Rabbi Chiya promises to perform.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ק״ג ב׳, בבא מציעא פ״ח ב׳.</span></i>
Upon his arrival in Palestine Rabbi Chiya was received with love and honor by Rabbi Jehudah and he ate at his table.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין ע״ג א׳.</span></i> When he helped the Nasi with the formulation of a law, Rabbi Jehudah applied to him the verse of Isaiah (46:11) “from a far land my counsellor has come.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מנחות פ״ח ב׳.</span></i> The great respect in which Rabbi Jehudah held Rabbi Chiya was exhibited on numerous occasions; when they arrived at the academy, Rabbi Jehudah asked Rabbi Chiya to enter first<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי כלאים פרק ט׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i> and during a discussion of a question of cleanliness Rabbi Jehudah declared: “Leave my words and listen to the words of Rabbi Chiya.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה ל״ו ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jehudah always confided to Rabbi Chiya all his scholastic innovations and when he once forgot some of these during his sickness, Rabbi Chiya repeated them to him. Rabbi Jehudah then declared: “You have again made me what I had been!”<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדרים מ״א א׳.</span></i>
Outstanding among Rabbi Chiya’s legal achievements are his formulations of the laws governing interests.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא ס״ב ב׳.</span></i> He also made many innovations which he wrote down in a book, but these were not accepted by the people and they were named <span dir="rtl">״מגילת סתרים״</span> (the scroll of secrecy).<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת י׳ ב׳, סוכה נ״ב ב׳, בבא מציעא צ״ב א׳.</span></i> Rabbi Chiya participated in the compilation of the “Tosephta” and together with his pupil Rabbi Oshaia he shared in gathering the “Boraitha.” It was an accepted rule at that time that any Boraitha which was not expounded by either Rabbi Chiya or Rabbi Oshaia is of doubtful authenticity.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין קמ״א ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Chiya frequently accompanied Rabbi Jehudah on the latter’s travels in the fulfillment of his duties as Nasi or to the imperial court in the interests of the people.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה ה׳ ב׳, תנחומא פ׳ וישב.</span></i> Whenever Rabbi Jehudah was displeased with him he merely remarked: “I think that someone is calling you outside.” Rabbi Chiya would then understand the hint and would remain away from the academy for thirty days.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן ט״ז ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Chiya resided in Tiberias most of the time and there he conducted an academy. Frequently he would be empowered by Rabbi Jehudah to determine the day of the new months and to establish leap years and he would then be sent to other communities to inform the inhabitants of these decisions. Rabbi Jehudah lived in Sephoris which was located in Galilee, but the law prescribed that the determination of a new month or a leap year had to be made in a city of Judea.<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין י״א ב׳.</span></i> A special court was therefore established in Ein Tuv and Rabbi Chiya went there to represent the Nasi at these functions.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה כ״ג א׳.</span></i>
To earn his livelihood Rabbi Chiya engaged in commerce and in partnership with Rabbi Simeon, the son of Rabbi Jehudah, he traded in silk which was then marketed in Tyre.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">רות רבה פּרשה א׳.</span></i> Later he also traded in flax.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי בבא מציעא פרק ה׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i> He was successful in his commercial ventures and he had to entrust the conduct of some of his business to his nephew Rav (Aba Arecha). Rabbi Chiya was also considered to be an authority on coins. It is related that a woman once came to him and asked him concerning the value of a coin and he declared that it was genuine. The following day the woman brought the same coin and he said that it was false, but since he declared it to be genuine on the previous day he commanded Rav to exchange it for a good coin and to write down the loss as an unsuccessful transaction.<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא צ״ט ב׳.</span></i>
Despite his success Rabbi Chiya never boasted of his wealth and when the poor came to his house he would say to his wife: “Give them bread and in the future they may return it to your children.” His wife objected by saying: “You curse your own children,” but Rabbi Chiya replied: “I do not curse them but such is the changing fate of the world.”<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קנ״א ב׳.</span></i>
Of Rabbi Chiya’s family life it was related that his wife twice gave birth to twins and because her laboring pains were so great, she vowed never to bear children again. Dressed in different clothes and with her face covered by a veil to prevent her husband from recognizing her, she came to his academy and asked him whether a woman was legally compelled to bear children. Rabbi Chiya declared that she was not compelled to do so. The woman then drank a medicine which the women of that time used to avoid bearing children.<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ס״ה ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Chiya was devoted to the Torah and at prayer he would repeat a special prayer of his own asking God to make the Torah his life work and to preserve him from an ailing heart and from failing vision.<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ט״ז ב׳.</span></i> When he was asked what was the aim of woman in life if she was not obliged to engage in study, he replied that “women should bring their children to the academy and they must also accompany their husbands to the synagogue and wait there until they will come out after prayer.”<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות י״ז א׳.</span></i>
To avoid seeing others put to shame Rabbi Chiya sometimes sacrificed his own dignity. It once occurred that while he was lecturing at the academy, Rabbi Jehudah noticed the odor of garlic. Being in an angry mood that day Rabbi Jehudah exclaimed: “Whoever had eaten garlic should leave the academy.” Rabbi Chiya was the first to rise and leave the building. The others saw him leave and knowing that he could not have been guilty of the offense they all followed his example and went out in order not to put the offender to shame.<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין י״א א׳.</span></i>
Much was spoken of Rabbi Chiya’s saintliness and it was said that since his arrival in Palestine storms no longer occurred and the wine never turned sour.<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין פ״ו א׳.</span></i>
Another legend related that the prophet Elijah appeared to Rabbi Jehudah and informed him that in the eyes of God Rabbi Chiya and his sons had the same merit as the Patriarchs and that all their prayers would be answered. It then occurred that no rain fell for a long time. Rabbi Jehudah declared a fast and he ordered Rabbi Chiya to pray before the pulpit. As soon as Rabbi Chiya reached the words “He causes the winds to blow” a strong wind arose and when he pronounced the words “He causes the rain to fall” rain began to descend. When Rabbi Chiya reached the words “He causes the dead to come to life” everyone in heaven was disturbed, for it seemed that the hour of resurrection was at hand and it was asked in heaven who had revealed the secret to the people. When it became known that Elijah had revealed the secret, he was punished with sixty fiery lashes. Elijah then descended to earth in the guise of a fiery bear and scattered the congregation from the synagogue.<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פ״ח ב׳.</span></i>
Legend further relates that when Rabbi Chiya was about to die, the angel of death was afraid to touch him. He therefore assumed the guise of a poor man and knocked on the door. Rabbi Chiya heard this and said to the members of his household: “There is a poor man at the door. Give him some bread.” The angel of death appealed to Rabbi Chiya and said: “I have heard you pity a poor man and order that he be given bread. Why then do you also not have pity on me? You know that I was sent to take your soul. Give it to me that I should not have to come here again.”<sup class="footnote-marker">30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ח א׳.</span></i>
When Rabbi Chiya died—the Talmud continues—fiery stones fell from heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ה ב׳.</span></i>

Rabbi Simeon ben Chalafta

R<small>ABBI</small> S<small>IMEON BEN</small> C<small>HALAFTA</small> was one of the outstanding colleagues of Rabbi Jehudah ha-Nasi during the latter’s old age. He was a member of a family of scholars and the Talmud referred to his father as Be Rabbi (the son of a rabbi) which indicates that at least three generations had been ordained. The family of Rabbi Simeon was a loyal adherent of the dynasty of the Nasi for many generations. Rabbi Chalafta (sometimes called Chalfuta, Chulafta and Tachlifa) was a son of Rabbi Jose ben Chalafta who prided himself that he had planted five cedar trees in Israel, referring to his five sons of whom Chalafta was one.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ח ב׳, ירושלמי יבמות פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Simeon ben Chalafta was one of the last disciples of Rabbi Meir. Later he attended the academy of Rabbi Jehudah and he was befriended by the Nasi because of the loyalty of his family to the holders of that office. Rabbi Simeon lived in the town of Ein T’enah which was located between Sephoris and Tiberias. Once a month he regularly visited Rabbi Jehudah when the latter lived in Sephoris and also after he moved to Tiberias. As Rabbi Simeon left the house of the Nasi, Rabbi Jehudah once sent his son to follow him and to obtain his blessing. Rabbi Simeon blessed him in the following words: “May God grant that you should never put others to shame nor be put to shame yourself.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן ט׳ ב׳.</span></i>
As Rabbi Simeon grew older it became more difficult for him to make the trip and he finally gave up his visits to the house of the Nasi. When Rabbi Jehudah asked him: “What is the cause of your absence that I cannot greet you any more as my fathers used to greet your fathers?” Rabbi Simeon replied: “The stones on my way have become larger and I can no longer step over them. Things nearby appear to be far and I cannot see them; that which is distant must now appear to be near that I may hear it and in addition to my two feet I need a third one to lean on.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קנ״ב א׳, ויקרא רבה פּרשה י״ח.</span></i>
Rabbi Simeon maintained a close friendship with Rabbi Chiya bar Aba and with Rabbi Simeon, the son of the Nasi. It is related that all three of them once were in doubt concerning the meaning of some Hebrew words, but passing by an Arab merchant they discovered the meaning of the words from his conversation.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ע״ט פּיסקא ח׳.</span></i>
The Mishna quotes Rabbi Simeon only once to the effect that “God has no better medium for blessing than peace.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עוקצין פרק ג׳ משנה י״ב.</span></i>
The friendly relations between Rabbi Simeon and Rabbi Chiya were quite understandable. They were both students in the academy of the Nasi and when Rabbi Chiya was informed of the poverty of Rabbi Simeon he leased to him one of his fields from which Rabbi Simeon later derived a comfortable income. Before he leased the field Rabbi Simeon was in great need and his situation was aggravated by the fact that he refused all aid. It was said that out of great pity, Rabbi Jehudah would place small heaps of grain on the street; since these no longer belonged to anyone Rabbi Simeon would gather them.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">רות רבה פּרשה ה׳.</span></i> When on a certain Friday Rabbi Simeon found himself without a morsel of food in the house he went out of the city to pray that God may send him aid. He was then handed a diamond from heaven and this he pawned and obtained enough money to provide for the Sabbath, but his wife refused to partake of the food until he promised to return the diamond immediately after the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מדרש תנחומא פ׳ פּקודי.</span></i>
Another Midrash relates this story in a somewhat different version. Rabbi Simeon ben Chalafta and Rabbi Chiya are said to have been in the academy of Tiberias on the eve of a holiday. As they were engaged in study they suddenly became aware of a great commotion in the street and Rabbi Simeon asked what was the cause of it. Rabbi Chiya replied: “Those who have money now go to buy the things they need for the holiday; those who have none go to their employers to obtain the necessary money,” Rabbi Simeon then said: “I will also go to my employer to ask for money for the holiday.” By this he meant that he would pray to God whom he always served.
He left the academy and proceeded to the caves outside the city where he prayed to God. Suddenly a hand appeared and handed him a pearl. Rabbi Simeon took the pearl to Rabbi Jehudah who advised that he should not sell it until he ascertained its worth. Meanwhile Rabbi Jehudah gave him three ducats with which to purchase his holiday needs.
When Rabbi Simeon came home with his purchase his wife asked him: “Where did you get the money? Did you not steal it?” and he related to her what had happened. Rabbi Simeon’s wife was displeased and said: “Would you have a pearl missing from your crown in the world to come?” Rabbi Simeon asked her what he should do and she advised him to return the purchased articles and with the money to redeem the pearl and to return it to heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">רות רבה פּרשה ג׳ פּיסקא ד׳.</span></i>
Another story is told of Rabbi Simeon ben Chalafta that on one of his journeys he came across two hungry lions. Rabbi Simeon was greatly frightened but before the lions attacked him he was handed from heaven two pieces of meat one of which he gave to the lions and the other he brought to the academy to ask the scholars whether it was clean and fit to eat. He was then informed that “no unclean thing can come from heaven.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין נ״ט ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Simeon’s opinions are quoted in the Talmud and it was characteristic of his religious conception that he declared that children nine or ten years old should be commanded to fast on the Day of Atonement.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי יומא פרק ח׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
Once Rabbi Simeon went with Rabbi Chiya in the valley of Arbel to watch the sunrise and to determine how long it takes from the first break of dawn until full day-light. On that occasion Rabbi Simeon said: “See how slowly dawn turns into day. Equally slow is the coming of aid to Jews.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ד׳ ב׳, ירושלמי ברכות פרק א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Simeon declared that since flattery had become prevalent men follow devious ways and their activities have sunk to a low level and one may no longer boast to his friend that his actions are more important.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה מ״א ב׳.</span></i> Another time he said: “The courageous usually triumphs over the modest.” He came to this conclusion from the fact that God seemingly changed his mind and did not destroy the city of Nineveh as He announced through the prophet Jonah because “he who is daring in his prayers can obtain his wishes even from God.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי תענית פרק ב׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
He also said: “One who has studied Torah but does not fulfill its commandments commits a greater sin than one who has never studied. It is as if one hires two watchmen for his garden, one of whom plants beautiful trees and later breaks them; the owner of the garden is angered with him more than he is angered with the watchman who planted nothing.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">דברים רבה פּרשה ז׳ פּיסקא ד׳.</span></i>
In addition to the stories that were told of Rabbi Simeon’s poverty there were other legends current about wonderful events which happened to him. As he was once going to attend a circumcision dressed in his best garments he attracted the attention of the children of the street who surrounded him and would not let him pass until he danced before them. Rabbi Simeon pleaded with them that he could not dance because of his great age and when they refused to leave him he scolded them and said that the gate of the house would collapse. He then sent them to call the owner of the house to come out at once. When the owner appeared, Rabbi Simeon warned him to remove all his possessions from the house and as soon as that was done the gate collapsed.
At the feast which followed the circumcision the father served valuable old wine and said: “If I will live I will serve the same kind of wine at the wedding of my son,” and Rabbi Simeon replied : “Even as the child was today inducted into the covenant of Abraham he will grow to go to the canopy and we will both drink again.”
On his way home Rabbi Simeon met the angel of death who addressed him in the following words: “Just because you are a just man are you not afraid to go alone at night?” When Rabbi Simeon asked the angel whither he was bound, the angel replied that he was going to take the soul of the child that had been circumcised that day. Rabbi Simeon scolded the angel of death for wishing to prove him a liar because he had promised to drink at the boy’s wedding and with these words he annuled the decree of death against the child.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קהלת רבה פּרשה ג׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Simeon ben Chalafta also devoted himself to the natural sciences and he cured a bird whose back was paralyzed. When one of his hens lost all her feathers he warmed the bird in an oven and covered it with a cloth and thus caused its feathers to grow again.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין נ״ז ב׳.</span></i>
It is also related that Rabbi Simeon had a garden in which there was a hollow stump of a tree where a bird made its nest. Rabbi Simeon destroyed the nest but the bird repaired it again, and when he boarded up the hollow, the bird brought some herbs which it placed on the nails in the board and the nails were corroded. Rabbi Simeon then cursed the herb that it may grow no more for fear that thieves may discover it and use it to break locks.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קהלת רבה פּרשה ה׳.</span></i>

Levi ben Sisi

L<small>EVI BEN</small> S<small>ISI</small> was the most prominent of Rabbi Jehudah’s last disciples. He is usually referred to without his patronymic and although he was often called a “Great Man,”<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת נ״ט ב׳, סוכה נ״ג א׳.</span></i> it appears that he was not ordained, for we find no instance in the Babylonian Talmud where he is referred to as Rabbi. This title was attached to his name in the Jerusalem Talmud and in the Midrashim.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק א׳ הלכה ה׳, ראש השנה פרק א׳ הלכה ה׳, סוכה פרק ב׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i> It is difficult to understand why Levi had not been ordained because he conducted his own academy and his legal opinions were quoted by many scholars of that time such as Rav (Aba Arecha), Shmuel Yarchinai, Rabbi Jochanan and Resh Lakish. This question becomes even more perplexing when one considers that his father was ordained and that no cause is mentioned for his lack of ordination.
Levi ben Sisi was born in Palestine about 160 years after the destruction of the temple. Some historians name the city of Lud as his birthplace. He was one of Rabbi Jehudah’s brilliant pupils and he tutored Rabbi Jehudah’s son Simeon. The relations between Levi and his pupil were not friendly and Simeon insisted on choosing his own subjects of study.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה י״ט א׳.</span></i> These unfriendly relations probably continued until the death of Rabbi Jehudah. There are some indications that Levi was a candidate for the post of Chacham in the academy, but this office was bequeathed to Simeon in his father’s will.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ק״ג ב׳.</span></i> For this reason, or because of his considerable wealth, to the administration of which he had to devote much time, Levi did not frequently attend the academy.
The attitude of Rabbi Jehudah toward Levi ben Sisi was not definite. When Rabbi Simeon ridiculed some question of Levi, Rabbi Jehudah declared that it was a wise question,<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">זבחים ל׳ ב׳.</span></i> and at one time he appointed Levi to an office in the academy.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין י״ז ב׳.</span></i> Another time Rabbi Jehudah was annoyed with Levi’s questions and he exclaimed: “It seems to me that this man has no brains in his head.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ט׳ א׳, מנחות פ׳ ב׳.</span></i>
At Rabbi Simeon’s wedding Levi was honored with reciting the benediction,<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ח׳ ב׳.</span></i> and when representatives of Simunia, which was located in lower Galilee, came to Rabbi Jehudah and asked him to recommend someone who could fill the post of lecturer, judge, teacher and scribe, Rabbi Jehudah recommended Levi ben Sisi. The men of Simunia then seated Levi on a great platform and questioned him concerning the laws of “Halitza” and Levi could not answer their questions. Thinking that he was unacquainted with legal matters, they asked him the meaning of a verse of Daniel and he could not give that either. They then came to Rabbi Jehudah and said: “Was it for such a man that we asked you?” but Rabbi replied: “I swear by my life that he is my equal in learning.”
Later Rabbi sent for Levi and asked him the same questions which he answered correctly. “Why did you not answer them before?” Rabbi queried, and Levi replied: “When they placed me on the platform I became confused and did not know what to say.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ק״ה א׳, ירושלמי יבמות פרק י״ב הלכה ו׳, בראשית רבה פּרשה פּ״א.</span></i>
Levi ben Sisi also devoted himself to athletics and he could perform acrobatic tricks such as throwing eight knives simultaneously and catching them in his hand. He also performed other athletic feats despite the fact that he was lame.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוכה נ״ג א׳, תענית כ״ה א׳, מגלה כ״ב ב׳.</span></i> There is also evidence that he paid close attention to his appearance and that he painted his eyelids although he believed that the practice was dangerous and may cause death.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי עבודה זרה פרק ב׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>
Like Rabbi Jehudah, Levi ben Sisi also compiled six “orders” of Mishnayoth which are mentioned in the Talmud under various names such as “the books of Levi,”<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קנ״ו א׳.</span></i> “the holiness of the house of Levi,”<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ע״ו ב׳, בבא בתרא נ״ב א׳.</span></i> and “the writings of Rabbi Levi.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי בבא בתרא פרק ו׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i> On other occasions opinions are introduced by the words “Levi taught” or “Levi taught in the Mishna.” Rashi likewise states that “Levi compiled the ‘Boraitha’ in six orders like Rabbi Chiya and Rabbi Oshaiah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות נ״ג ב׳.</span></i>
As long as Rabbi Jehudah lived, Levi returned to Palestine after each trip abroad.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה כ״א א׳, קדושין ע״ב א׳.</span></i> Although he was not on friendly terms with the son of the Nasi, he frequently sent gifts to the house of the Nasi and once he sent wine made out of dates which was purified thirteen times.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים ק״ז א׳.</span></i> Only after the death of Rabbi Jehudah, when Levi remained without friends in Palestine, did he remember his comrades in Babylonia and he thought of finding a new field of work in that country. When Levi arrived in Nehardea he was received with open arms and he was assisted in founding an academy.<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי סוכה פרק ד׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
The rumor rapidly spread that a “great man” had arrived and many people came from far and near to hear his lectures and to ask his opinion. Wonderful stories began to circulate about him. One of these related that when strange soldiers wanted to rob his city Levi took a book of the Torah and ascending the roof of the house he addressed God in the following words: “Creator of the world! If I have ever transgressed against one of your commandments let the enemy enter the city, but if I have not, then cause them to depart.” The foreign soldiers immediately vanished from the city.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי תענית פרק ג׳ הלכה ח׳.</span></i>
Levi’s lameness was explained to be the result of an acrobatic trick which he attempted to perform before Rabbi Jehudah. A more interesting explanation tells that it was a punishment for his arrogance against God. Once a severe drouth affected the land. A fast day was declared but still no rain fell. Levi is said to have made the following remark to God at that time: “You sit on high and You have no mercy on Your children!” As soon as he finished this statement he became lame.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית כ״ח א׳.</span></i>
In his will Rabbi Jehudah commanded that his son Gamliel should succeed him to the office of Nasi, Simeon should be Chacham in the academy and Rabbi Chanina bar Chama should be head of the court in Sephoris. Rabbi Chanina refused to accept this post since Rabbi Ephes, the secretary of Rabbi Jehudah, was his senior by two years. Rabbi Ephes then became head of the court and Rabbi Chanina together with Levi were in the habit of sitting outside the academy. After the death of Rabbi Ephes, Rabbi Chanina assumed the post of head of the court and Levi remained alone. Levi also refused to recognize the authority of Rabbi Chanina because they were both of the same age and because he considered himself the equal of Rabbi Chanina in learning. It was at that time that Levi left Palestine and went to Nehardea.
In Nehardea he gained the friendship of Aba bar Aba, the father of Shmuel Yarchinai. Together they prayed and studied and, at the request of Aba, Levi examined his son Shmuel.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מנחות ל״ח א׳.</span></i> After that, whenever Shmuel had any doubts he turned to Levi.<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה פּ׳.</span></i>
In Nehardea Levi introduced new regulations. Thus he ruled that women may appear on the street on the Sabbath adorned in their jewelry. This regulation was accepted and the Talmud relates that twenty-four women appeared in their jewelry.<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת נ״ט ב׳.</span></i>
Levi ben Sisi had ten scholarly sons whose names are listed in the Talmud. According to some authorities Rabbi Joshua ben Levi was also his son. When Levi died he was mourned by Aba bar Aba who pointed out the greatness of the generation of Rabbi Jehudah’s contemporaries of whom Levi was the last one. In his eulogy Aba bar Aba said: “The life of Levi ben Sisi may be compared to the story of a king who had a vineyard in which there were one hundred vines each of which yielded one hundred barrels of wine yearly. In time the vines dried up and with every passing year fewer remained until in the end there was no more than one vine left. The king loved this last vine as he once loved his whole vineyard. Even so was Levi ben Sisi beloved of God like an only remaining vine.”<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ב׳ הלכה ח׳.</span></i>
With the death of Levi ben Sisi the epoch of the “Tanaim” came to a close and the period of the “Amoraim” began.

Volume II; The Amoraim of Palestine and the Jerusalem Talmud

Introduction

A<small>NY TREATISE ON THE</small> A<small>MORAIM</small> must begin with the Amoraim of Palestine who were the direct heirs of the Tanaim and the last link in the long chain of the development of the oral law which stretched from the days of the Men of the Great Synagogue down to their time.<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">For a better enlightment of the subject, we have to repeat that a teacher of the “Mishna” was called “Tana” (plural: “Tanaim”) and a teacher of the “Gemara” was called “Amora” (plural: “Amoraim”).</i> The Amoraim of Babylonia, on the other hand, marked the beginning of a new historical epoch for the Jews of that country which continued for centuries after the spark of spiritual life expired in Palestine.
With the completion of the Mishna, whose authority was recognized both in Palestine and in Babylonia, the Jewish law assumed its final form. In both countries the Mishna was recognized as the deciding factor in all problems of life, but the subsequent development of the laws followed different lines in each country. None, however dared to question the interpretations of the Tanaim even when these concerned Biblical verses which had no direct relationship to religious problems.
When we consider the teachings of the Tanaim and Amoraim it becomes obvious, that they sought to establish a worthy continuation to the teachings of the prophets, who aimed to elevate the ethics of the Jews to the highest possible level. They therefore interpreted the commandments of the Torah in such a manner as to inculcate the people with feelings of justice, love of peace and love of one’s neighbor. This aim caused some of the scholars to believe that study of the Torah and the fulfillment of its commandments was most important in life even though one did not agree with the commandments. Others said that after the coming of Messiah all commandments would be done with and there would no longer be any need for written laws.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדה ס״א ב׳, מדרש תהלים פּרשה נ״ו.</span></i>
There is a Midrash extant which declares that those Jews who had left Egypt and wandered in the desert belonged to a “generation of knowledge,” because they possessed a measure of civilization and not, as might be assumed, they were untutored slaves who had just acquired freedom. Many critics ironically nod their heads at sight of this Midrash, but on closer observation of the commandments of the Torah it becomes obvious that those Jews possessed a high measure of culture.
Like other civilized peoples of that time, the Jews understood the art of cloth making while still in Egypt. Even if we assume that their garments were not made of the finest stuffs, skill was nevertheless required to weave the linen of which their garments were made. They understood the art of agriculture and the various occupations involved in it such as plowing, sowing, harvesting, threshing, grinding and baking. They also were acquainted with animal husbandry and its attendant occupations. While still in bondage they built houses and cities and they learned to bake bricks out of clay. Woodwork, masonry, metal work, wine making and hunting were also not strange to them. They knew how to find water in the depths of the earth and how to maintain fires. They made decorations out of precious metals and they pressed oil out of olives.
In their social relationships they maintained a civilized system of order which included representatives and judges, policemen and arrests. They understood how to divide time into weeks, months and years. In commerce they used money as is obvious from the stories of Abraham’s purchase of the cave of Machpelah and of Jacob’s purchase of a tract of land from the sons of Chamor for which he paid 100 Kesitah. In general we may say that the people of that time possessed a high level of intelligence and that the Jews were not behind the times. When other nations were governed by laws we may assume that the Jews did not live in lawlessness.
In the case of some commandments the Torah merely added legal sanction to customs which were already practiced. Thus Rashbam (Samuel ben Meir, the grandson of Rashi) states in his interpretation to the Torah that rules governing robbery, sexual relations, covetousness, courts and hospitality were accepted among the Jews even before the Torah was granted. In this case the Torah merely strengthened the accepted conduct and insured the observance of these laws in the future.
All the civilized peoples of that time, including the Jews of the period preceding the granting of the Torah, were called the “sons of Noah.” As such they only had to observe seven commandments, namely, to deal out justice, not to desecrate the name of God, not to worship idols, not to commit adultery, not to commit murder, not to rob and not to eat flesh that was cut from a living animal. Some maintain that the prohibitions against consuming the blood of a living animal, castration, witchcraft, mating different breeds of animals and planting mixed seeds were included in the above mentioned seven commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין נ״ו ב׳.</span></i>
The Talmud declares that even Adam was commanded to obey these commandments with the exception of the one concerning eating the flesh of a living animal, since the consumption of meat was altogether prohibited until the deluge. Others said that the “sons of Noah” had thirty commandments to observe.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין צ״ב א׳.</span></i> But these probably included many observances which were derived from the original seven commandments. It is quite understandable, that in order to conduct trials it was necessary to know which people to select as judges. Likewise, in the matter of adultery, regulations had to be established defining which women were forbidden. The concept of robbery also required definition since borrowing money and not repaying it and not paying the wage of a laborer were then considered to be robbery.
The offering of sacrifices from animals, fowl and fruit was customary since time immemorial. Cain offered a sacrifice from the fruit of his fields and Abel offered his best sheep. After the deluge Noah erected an altar and offered sacrifices. Abraham and Jacob likewise erected altars for the offering of sacrifices. When Moses asked Pharaoh to release the Jews, he said that they had to go to the desert to offer sacrifices to God. Rabbi Saadiah Gaon declared that since sacrifices and circumcision preceded the establishment of the Sabbath, both of them superseded the Sabbath. During the later development of divine service, which at that time consisted of sacrificial offerings, the belief became accepted among many peoples that ordinary men could not fulfill this task since they were not acquainted with all the regulations governing the offerings. This caused the establishment of a separate group of people who devoted themselves solely to sacrifices and who abstained from ordinary labor. For the support of these people tithes were offered by all. Thus we find Abraham giving tithes to Malchi-Zedek, who was a priest of “the highest God”; Jacob vowed to tithe all his possessions if God would bless his journey and would provide him with bread and garments.
The first born son at first performed the divine service. This procedure was also accepted among the Jews until the tabernacle was built. Later the performance of this office was taken out of the hands of the first born and was entrusted to the descendants of Aaron. Further development necessitated the establishment of a class of assistants to the descendants of Aaron and the Levites were added to the service. The priests performed the offering of sacrifices and they received the first fruit, the first born animals and similar gifts. The Levites who worked in the tabernacle were granted tithes, one-tenth of everyone’s income. Of this the Levites had to give one-tenth to the priests. But the rights of the first born were preserved in the government of the family as a representative of the father. The first born also received a double share in the inheritance. If a man had children by two wives one of whom he loved and the other he hated and the first born was a son of the despised wife, the father nevertheless had to recognize the rights of this son to a double share in the inheritance. The custom of the priests blessing the people is very ancient. The first priest to do so was Malchi-Zedek who blessed Abraham. Thus it is also related that Aaron blessed the children of Israel even before the Torah explicitly commanded him to do so.
Even before the deluge Noah could differentiate between animals that were considered as clean and between those that were considered to be unclean. The Talmud questions this and the answer was given that when all the animals sought safety in the ark it admitted only one pair from some kinds of animals and seven pairs from other kinds. By this token it was known which were the clean and which the unclean animals.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ק״ח ב׳.</span></i>
Soon after man began to develop family life he recognized his near relatives as part of himself. When rights of property were established he enacted laws to secure his possessions for his relations and he likewise made certain that after his death his possessions would remain within the family. In this manner laws of inheritance were established. Abraham complained to God and said: “Since you gave me no offspring, the manager of my house will inherit me.” Jews also practiced the same custom that was accepted among other peoples in denying a daughter a share in the inheritance. Every father gave his daughter her share as a dowry at the time that she was married. Since daughters could marry men of other tribes, they could not share in the inheritance of their fathers in order that the possessions of one tribe should not pass to another tribe.
Long before the Torah was granted, the descendants of Abraham observed the commandment of circumcision. It may even be assumed that the descendants of Ishmael and the sons of Keturah observed this commandment with greater strictness than did the Jews who did not practice circumcision for forty years while in the desert.
Among other civilized concepts man also learned to observe vows and oaths. He understood his duty of abiding by his word whether that concerned himself or others. All of these concepts civilized peoples possessed long before the Torah was given. The patriarch Abraham swore to Abimelech not to harm him or his descendants. Jacob vowed and later swore to Laban not to trespass his boundaries with evil intent.
The slaughter of animals for food was always considered to be a natural procedure and was practiced from time immemorial. It may also be assumed that such slaughter was always done by cutting the throat of the animal. This form was probably adopted as a reaction against the savage method of beasts of prey which break the necks of their victims. Since the commandments of the Torah aim to refine the people and are based on mercy, it was strictly forbidden to cause unnecessary suffering to any living creature.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קכ״ה ב׳.</span></i>
Since ancient times man recognized the concepts of purity and impurity. As soon as man could esthetically comprehend the concept of cleanliness, he avoided coming in contact with things that were unclean. It was then believed that evil spirits inhabited the unclean objects and that they would gain control of the clean body which touched the impure one. Thus Jacob commanded his household when he left Shechem and said: “Cast out the strange idols from your midst, clean yourself and don other garments.” People likewise avoided coming in contact with a woman in the days of her separation, with unclean animals or insects.
Bathing in water was the accepted mode of purification. In this manner all impurity was washed away. Before giving the Torah, God commanded the people to consecrate themselves and to wash their garments. This was also the reason why a proselyte had to immerse himself in water and even though he was circumcised, he was not accepted as a proselyte until after immersion. Menstruating women were also required to bathe before being considered pure. This appears to have been an ancient custom observed by all civilized peoples.
There is no doubt that all of these commandments later evolved into numerous supplementary observances. With the development of society punishments were determined for infractions of these commandments. But no matter how much the scholars wanted that the commandments of the Torah should be observed, they nevertheless warned against observing a commandment at the expense of committing a sin, as in the case of obtaining an object illegally in order to do some good deed with it.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות מ״ז ב׳, סוכה ל׳ א׳, בבא קמא צ״ד א׳.</span></i> But in some exceptional instances the ignoring of one commandment could aid in the fulfillment of another as when study of the Torah was interrupted in order to perform some philanthropic deed.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מנחות צ״ט ב׳.</span></i>
Ordinarily there was no prohibition which could not be broken in order to save a life with the exception of committing murder, worshipping idols or committing a sexual offense in order to save one’s life.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא פּ״ב א׳.</span></i> These three sins were considered to be so great that even if one’s life depended on one of them it was forbidden to employ them.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים כ״ה א׳.</span></i>
Observance of the Sabbath was treated differently. Even though it was also considered to be very important and one who desecrated the Sabbath was to be punished by death, it was nevertheless accepted that the Sabbath could be desecrated in order to aid one whose life was in danger.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא פּ״ג א׳.</span></i> The Tana Rabbi Simeon ben Menasia thus said that “the Sabbath was given to the people and not the people to the Sabbath.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכילתא מסכתא דשבתא פּיסקא י״ד.</span></i> In order to save the life of a person Rabbi Nathan said that “it is permissible to desecrate one Sabbath in order that he may observe many Sabbaths to come.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכילתא כי תשא פּיסקא מ״ז.</span></i>
The Talmud declares that the basic purpose of religious regulations was to enable people to live and not to kill them.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ע״ד א׳.</span></i> It likewise states that he who destroys one Jewish soul is like one who destroyed a whole world and he who maintains one Jewish person alive is like one who saved a whole world.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ל״ז א׳</span></i>
People were forbidden by the scholars to harm themselves even as they were forbidden to harm others.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא צ״א ב׳.</span></i> When the Torah said that fruit trees should not be cut down during the siege of a city, the scholars added that one may not cut down a fruit tree even in his own garden and he who did so was to be punished.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכות כ״ב א׳, ספרי דברים פּיסקא כ״ג.</span></i> On other occasions the scholars said that endangering one’s life was worse than committing a sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין ו׳ א׳, תענית י״א א׳, ויקרא רבה ל״ב ג׳.</span></i>
The Talmud further declares that the Torah was concerned with the honor of the people. In its eyes the worth of man was so great that one could sometimes overlook a commandment because of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות י״ט ב׳, שבת כ״א ב׳, ערובין מ״א ב׳, מנחות ל״ז ב׳.</span></i>
Thieves were usually enslaved after they were forced to pay twice the price of the stolen goods. If a living animal was stolen, the thief had to pay four or five times its value. At times thieves were also sentenced to death or to be flogged. The death sentence was imposed by the Torah for stealing a human being and selling him into slavery. Nevertheless the Torah showed consideration even for the thief and the scholars declared that the reason why a thief had to pay five times the value of a stolen ox and only four times the value of a stolen sheep was that an ox can be led easily but a sheep has to be carried and this accounted for the easier punishment for one stealing a sheep.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא ע״ט ב׳.</span></i>
Other punishments, aside from death and flogging, were meted out to offenders against God or man. Prisons then existed and when one was flogged for an offense and he later committed a similar offense he was imprisoned.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין פּ״א ב׳.</span></i>
Self-inflicted torture as a religious ritual was known to man for a long time. The forms of this torture were numerous. Some renounced food and drink while others avoided pride. The drinking of wine was considered to be a luxury and he who wanted to deny himself pleasure for the greater glory of God renounced the drinking of wine. Shaving one’s head or letting one’s hair grow wild was at various times considered to be a means against pride. The scholars differed in their evaluation of these forms of self-torment. Some praised them while others condemned them as sinful.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית י״א א׳, סוטה ט״ו א׳, כריתות כ״ו א׳.</span></i> The majority of the scholars agreed with the opinion of Rabbi Jose that one should not torment himself with too many fasts.<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית כ״ב ב׳.</span></i>
The custom of mourning for dead relatives, as it is accepted in the form of a Biblical commandment, was a subject often questioned by the scholars. From the story of Joseph they deducted that mourning should last seven days. Others reached the same conclusion from the verse “I shall turn your feast days into mourning” and they said that even as each holiday lasts seven days so also must mourning last for seven days. There were also differing opinions among the scholars whether mourning was a Biblical commandment or whether it was instituted by the Rabbis. The Jerusalem Talmud declares that “Moses instituted for the Jews seven days of mourning and seven days of merry making.”<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
For seven centuries from the time of Simon the Just till the last Amora, Greek, Roman and Persian culture influenced Jewish life, which was so closely joined with it. For that reason we come across ideas which arose at different times under different circumstances and differentiated in their spirit and character. At times it is difficult to discover which event preceded and which followed and to separate fact from legend.
Our “Spiritual Heroes” ofttimes rise to great spiritual heights, while at the same time their ideas are rooted not alone in the past but look forward to the future as well. Their roots cleave a path through stem reality to the high ideals of mankind as a whole and emphasize those means which serve as a realization of those ideals.
It is this Talmudic forest whose trees contain the seed for the plants of future generations. It is also the source from which later law-givers derived their notions as well as being the form for the pursuit of learning in all its branches.

Life in Palestine During the Creation of the Jerusalem Talmud

S<small>OME OF OUR ENLIGHTENED PEOPLE</small> are of the opinion that while death and destruction raged in Palestine the scholars of that country secluded themselves within the walls of the synagogues and debated irrelevant religious problems. Such a view is highly superficial. In between wars and aside from the Talmudic discussions the people pursued their normal occupations. They sowed their fields, they engaged in various trades and they developed a highly complex Jewish cultural life.
There are but few sources of information concerning the mode of life of that time. The Talmud is the most trustworthy of these, although it was written much later when many of the previous customs were nearly forgotten. In addition to the Talmud there are less faithful descriptions in the writings of Josephus Flavius, the geographer Strabo and the naturalist Pliny.
During all these centuries the overwhelming majority of the Jews were agriculturists. These tillers of the soil were but little affected by the numerous incursions of the Romans. In the worst cases their cattle and produce were robbed but the farmers and their families were not molested. Even when the Romans were determined to destroy Judaism they understood that the farming population was the foundation of the productive forces in the country and should be spared. It is therefore certain that even when many Jews were exiled from the country the farmers were left to till their fields.
It must also be borne in mind that the Jewish farmer of that time was religious more than he was patriotic. As long as the Romans did not interfere with his offering of sacrifices he was satisfied and probably indifferent whether he paid his taxes to the Jerusalem aristocrats, who looked down upon him, or whether the taxes were collected by the Romans.
When the Hasmoneans ruled Palestine they acquired a number of seaports but the merchants and sailors of these cities were largely Phoenicians. Jews were then in the initial stages of learning the arts of commerce and navigation and their share in these occupations was negligible. Even the Jews of Galilee who were close neighbors of the Phoenicians excelled in agriculture and fruit growing rather than in commerce and Josephus described their land as “covered with fields of grain and resembling a large garden.”
The Bible described Palestine as a land of milk and honey but this blessing was not always realized. The Biblical curse that the heavens shall be like copper over their heads and the earth shall be like iron under their feet often approached nearer the truth when periods of drought affected the land. Nevertheless the tillers of the soil always managed to secure their bread despite the fact that the country was rocky and sandy to a large degree. The Jews loved their land and each one was convinced that it was the most beautiful in the world. They learned to improve the soil and to fertilize it artificially, to clear it of stones and to destroy obnoxious weeds. The fields were surrounded with cactus fences to prevent the cattle from trampling them and those that were located on steep hills were terraced. Every handbreadth of land was utilized and there were no more diligent workers than the farmers of Palestine. Agriculture was highly regarded by all and was especially revered by the Romans. Whereas in other lands the Romans encountered difficulties in persuading the people to till the soil, Palestine farmers were happy if they were left to pursue that labor.
The fertility of the soil of Palestine varied in different regions of the country. Jericho and its environs was praised by the writers of all times as “the city of dates.” Other districts excelled in wheat growing. It was said that the grain growing about the city of Ophroim attained such height that it provided sufficient straw for the needs of the whole country. The wheat of Galilee was also famous for its quality and some said that it excelled even the wheat of Judea. Rye, oats, barley, sorghum and other grains grew in abundance. Bread made out of barley meal was considered to be the staple article of food of the poorer elements. There was a great abundance of this meal and considerable quantities of it were exported to other countries from which rice was introduced and sowed in Palestine.
In ordinary years the grain crop was between five and ten fold that which was sown, but in years when the rains descended in time and the sun did not scorch the germinating seed the crop reached as much as a hundred fold. In years of bumper crops Palestine exported grain, but during lean years grain had to be imported from Egypt. Palestine abounded in all kinds of greens and vegetables such as cabbage, cucumbers, onions, garlic, radishes and various beans. In time new vegetables which had not grown there previously were introduced into the country. These different kinds of vegetables were avidly consumed. Due to the stringent regulations governing the offering of sacrifices people often abstained from eating meat and indulged in it only on Sabbaths and holidays or other festive occasions. After the destruction of the temple, when the offering of sacrifices was done away with, many people gave up meat altogether as an item in their diet.
Many varieties of fruit trees thrived in Palestine including figs, grapes, olives, carobs, oranges, ethrogim, plums, cherries, walnuts, almonds, dates, mulberries, pomegranates, apples and pears. In addition to these, new improved varieties were introduced and cultivated. Palestine was especially renowned for its wine, dates and wheat. The coins that were minted by the Hasmoneans bear ears of wheat, bunches of grapes and date palms as symbols of the fertility of the land. The vineyards of Judea were considered the most beautiful in that part of the world. Between the rows of trees and vines flowers were planted which filled the air with their fragrance. Raisins and date honey were commonly used as food. Oil, which was plentiful, was exported in great quantities, and just as Judea was renowned for its wine Galilee was famous for the quality of its oil. The oil was used as food and also for medicinal purposes and it was widely sold in Sidon, Syria and Egypt.
Pliny, the Roman “Natural-philosopher,” declared that Judea was famous for its dates just as Egypt was known for its incense. In the Talmud we find a story told by Rabbi Jacob ben Dostai that on his way from Lud to Ono, a distance of three miles, he waded ankle deep in fig honey.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות קי״א ב׳.</span></i>
The shores of the Dead Sea were covered with balsam and the districts of Gilead and Jericho were especially noted for it. Balsam was used as a medicine and also as incense. It was a very expensive commodity and the Romans declared that the Jews did not plant it elsewhere in order to maintain its rarity and to be able to sell it for a high price. After the destruction of the temple the Romans said that the Jews uprooted all the balsam trees in revenge on the Romans.
Sheep and cattle abounded in the land as a result of the need for sacrifices. There were many Jewish shepherds at that time and some of these also traded in cattle or in wool. This was especially true in the regions east of the Jordan. The women of Judea spun the wool and the women of Galilee spun flax and the garments were sold in the nearby cities. Many of the known varieties of fowl were introduced into the country at a later date. This is obvious from their Hebrew names which were never mentioned in the Bible. Geese, ducks and chickens were among the imported species and although they were not used for sacrificial purposes they were used as food. Many people also raised cattle and goats and considerable quantities of dairy products were consumed and exported.
Although some Jews engaged in hunting animals and birds the number of these was not great due to the numerous laws regarding unclean animals and the restrictions affecting slaughter. But many people engaged in fishing especially in Galilee. The sea of Gennesaret (sea of Galilee) abounded in many of the varieties of the best edible fish and scores of fishing villages dotted its shores. A great part of the catch was also exported.
The Dead Sea occupied a prominent place among the natural resources of the country. Various salts were extracted from its waters (salt of Sodom) as well as asphalt. These were sold far and wide and were used for medical purposes and also in the manufacture of cosmetics. Historical descriptions of Palestine also mentioned metal mines. Iron was mined in the Lebanon mountains and in the region north of Idumea. Josephus Flavius mentioned an iron mountain which extended to the boundary of Moab and in later years this metal was also mined in Trans-Jordania.
The trades and occupations of the Jews of that time are a subject of endless interest. The Talmud is the best historical source on this subject and it lists the following occupations as being most widely engaged in: tailoring, shoemaking, building, quarrying, carpentry, hairdressing, metal working, weaving, dyeing, tapestry-weaving, bee raising, pottery, glass blowing, engraving, tanning, ink and arms manufacturing.
But although all these trades were commonly practiced and Jewish artisans were accorded social recognition, they did not constitute a majority of the population. Farming engaged the efforts of the majority of the nation. This is evident from the fact that the Talmud devoted itself more to the interests of the farmers than it did to the interests of the artisans.
From the available historical data we may conclude that the Jewish artisans could not compete with the artisans of the foreign countries and when vessels or garments of higher quality were desired they had to be imported. This conclusion is also substantiated by the fact that the Talmud refers to all superior vessels or garments by their Greek names. This was also true of vegetables for some time, but as the years went by the superior varieties were cultivated also in Palestine. However there was a common conviction that articles of foreign manufacture were superior in quality and people of means bought their garments and decorated their houses with foreign importations.
Among the farming population the poorer peasants were in a majority. These were referred to in the Talmud as “Baal Habaith” and they usually possessed only a small tract of land from which they barely eked out a living. Together with the members of his family such a peasant would work in his field from dawn till sunset. Most of his produce he used for his own household and the remainder, after he paid his taxes and tithes, was marketed in the nearby cities where it was bartered or sold for money. Under such circumstances, the poorer peasants suffered every time a drought occurred or some other calamity overtook the country. He was then forced to hire out as a farm hand or to pawn his land to a richer farmer. But even when no unforseen calamities occurred, the poor peasant often had to become a wage-earner by working for another farmer. The parcelation of the land when it was being divided between the heirs left each of the heirs such a small holding that many were forced to hire out even during normal years. Those who could find no employment were forced to turn to begging or to brigandage.
In Galilee and Judea there existed a small class of rich farmers who owned considerable stretches of land and had a comfortable income. It was these people who loaned money to the poorer peasants and in time increased their holdings by seizing the land in payment of outstanding debts. They were also the merchants in grain and the Talmud refers to them as <span dir="rtl">״עתירי נכסין״</span> (men of much property). Although their number was small, they were socially prominent and exerted an influence on the administration of the land. They were generally the officials, the elders and members of the priestly families which accumulated the land of the poor. It is told that they engaged “Ikonomusin” (managers) and “Apitropsim” (overseers) to supervise the cultivation of their fields and vineyards while the owners remained in the city or travelled about in connection with their business ventures.
Thus the Talmud relates that Rabban Gamliel II, also known as Rabban Gamliel of Jabneh, employed a great number of laborers<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">דמאי פרק ג׳ משנה א׳.</span></i> and he also leased a part of his lands.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פרק ח׳ משנה ח׳.</span></i> Such a procedure was engaged in by people who did not live on their land. Rabban Gamliel was presiding officer of the Sanhedrin and had to reside in the city. He administered his lands through the agency on an “Economos” or an “Apitropos.”
Hired laborers were engaged for a definite period which may have been as much as a year or as little as a day or half a day but never for more than six years. Among the laborers there were men who owned small plots of land as well as those who owned no land at all. Those unskilled in agricultural work hired out as common laborers and engaged in the most difficult work.
The scholars always sided with the laborers when they had complaints against their employers. They also established definite regulations concerning the food and drink to which the laborers were entitled, and although it is possible that most of these rules defining the rights of the workers remained theoretical, it is nevertheless certain that the social differentiation between poor and rich was not as sharp among the Jews as it was among the other nations of that time. The persecution at the hands of the Gentiles to which Jews poor and rich were subject partly accounted for this state of affairs.
Contract farming was also a known phenomenon. A contractor would undertake to cultivate a field and he was responsible for all the operations. He would buy the seed, hire the laborers and work together with them. He was responsible for the payment of the taxes to the government and the tithes to the priests as well as for all other expenditures. In compensation he received half the crop. In addition there were “Arisim” (tenants) who received the seed, the tools and the animals required for cultivation from the owner. Tenants supplied only their labor.
Artisans and peasants in Palestine were free men. They could choose their own occupation and when they hired out they were free to leave at any time and the employer was legally bound to pay whatever wage was coming to them for the work which they had accomplished. The condition of the slaves was entirely different. In some respects the slaves were in a better position than the hired laborers but socially they occupied the lowest level. The slave was assured of his food and shelter, but he was not free to choose his occupation and he was dependent on the whims of his owner who could force him to work day and night.
The condition of the Jewish slave was peculiar. It was only on rare occasions that a Jew bought a Jewish slave. When the Gentiles from the surrounding countries brought Jewish slaves to sell, they were ransomed and immediately freed. But there were occasions when a Jew was in debt and he voluntarily sold himself into slavery to be able to repay his debt. Similarly, when a man was caught stealing and he had to pay twice the value of the article stolen, the court would sell him into slavery if he could not pay the required sum. Like the artisan and farm laborer, the Jewish slave sold only his labor power, but he did not have definite working hours and he could be called upon to perform some task at any hour of the day or night. However, he enjoyed the privilege of resting on the Sabbath and the holidays together with his owner.
Because of the preferred treatment which the owner had to accord a Jewish slave there were not many that were anxious to own them, and a statement current at the time declared that “He who buys a Jewish slave buys an overlord.” But there undoubtedly existed slave owners who did not grant their Jewish slaves any privileges and on the year of the Jubilee the courts had to force them to liberate their Jewish slaves. Human nature did not change much during the centuries and it is apparent that the generations of the time of the Talmud had to contend with the same problem that was recorded by Jeremiah (Ch. 34) that king Zedekiah commanded that all Jewish slaves be liberated and their owners soon enslaved them again.
Jewish slave owners were enjoined to treat their non-Jewish slaves with humaneness. Although the owner could beat his slave at will he was strictly warned not to starve him, and in case the slave was crippled through the loss of an eye or a limb, he was immediately liberated. If a slave died as a result of a beating, the Torah commanded that the owner be put to death; but when the slave survived his punishment by a day or more, the owner was not to be put to death.
Judging from numerous circumstances we may conclude that Jewish slaves felt a greater kinship to their owners than the non-Jewish slaves. They participated actively in the various rebellions against Rome and Josephus relates that during the war which ended with the destruction of the temple Bar Giora proclaimed the liberation of all Jewish slaves as the first step in his mobilization of an army. At the same time the Romans announced that all non-Jewish slaves who would betray their owners would be granted their freedom.
Non-Jewish slaves were brought from the markets of Tyre and Sidon. Their treatment in Palestine could compare favorably with their treatment in other countries. Every slave was branded on the forehead or he was given a cap with a bell on it to wear that he might be recognized. Compared with the treatment of slaves in other lands, these measures were relatively humane.
Slaves were the unrestricted property of their owners. If the owner so desired he could marry a slave to his mother or sister. But the marriage of a slave was of no significance and the owner retained his rights of possession. Children of slaves also belonged to the owner and could be sold at will. All possessions of a slave automatically belonged to his master who also claimed any object found by the slave. In addition the owner could rent the labor power of his slaves to others without consulting the slaves.
The Midrash relates the case of a man who persuaded his neighbor to divorce his wife because of her immoral conduct. When the husband complained that he could not divorce her because he did not have enough money to pay her dowry, the man offered to loan him the necessary sum. After the woman was divorced the creditor married her and enslaved her previous husband for inability to repay his debt. The man thus became the slave of his ex-wife and he was forced to witness her relations with his creditor.
But if the position of the male slave was unenviable, the condition of the women slaves was even worse. In addition to their labor they were held at the disposal of the owner and his sons. It is therefore remarkable that some women were sold by their own parents into such life.
There undoubtedly were many Jews who treated their slaves in a more humane manner. In many homes the slaves were employed in skilled work and were trusted with all confidence. Some of them were tailors or barbers; others were bakers and cooks. In some cases the owners even entrusted the education of their children to the slaves. Among the women slaves there were singers and dancers who entertained their owners and their guests.
The Mishna tells that Rabban Gamliel of Jabneh owned a slave named Tabbai whom he respected greatly and for whom he mourned a long time after his death. Another slave of Rabban Gamliel was called “father” and his wife was referred to as “mother.” It is quite probable that these were not isolated instances and that the lot of the slave of a Jew was better than that of a non-Jewish owner.

It must be borne in mind that the whole Jewish people was not mourning constantly for the destruction of the temple and the cessation of the sacrifices. It is even related that when Jerusalem was destroyed the people of Betar celebrated the occasion. It is also quite certain that the institution of sacrifices had lost much of its significance in the minds of many leaders and some of them were satisfied that Jabneh had been saved as a cultural center. Others, however, were convinced that the destruction of the temple was temporary and that it would soon be restored even as the first temple was rebuilt a short time after its destruction. This belief found a deep echo in the hearts of large sections of the population who looked upon themselves as people whose house had been burned and who were waiting for the construction of a new house. There is also no definite proof that the institution of sacrifices ceased with the temple and that small groups did not gather secretly to offer sacrifices. It is even possible that they brought their offerings on the site of the demolished altar. The fact that the regulations pertaining to the priests and the tithes were observed for a long time after the destruction is ample proof of the expectations of the people of a rapid restoration.
This was not an impossibility under the political conditions then prevailing. It was quite likely that some emperor would grant permission to rebuild the temple out of respect for the Jews or through the intercession of some influential person who could also pay for the right. But these hopes vanished with the rebellion of Bar Kochba against Hadrian. Over half a million Jews were killed in the uprising and hundreds of thousands of others were sold into slavery. The country was devastated and a temple to Zeus was erected in Jerusalem. Jews were not even allowed to approach the gates of the city.
But this was not the final expulsion from Palestine. Jews continued to reside in other cities and subsequent Roman emperors allowed them to visit Jerusalem on the ninth day of Ab to mourn for the destroyed temple.
Various historical events of that time are described in the Jerusalem as well as in the Babylonian Talmud and also in the Midrash. Most of these descriptions were not clearly understood until a recent date when certain Jewish historians made a careful study of these sources. Whenever the Talmudic descriptions are not in agreement with the facts as they are related by Roman historians it is safer to rely on the Talmudic sources.
That the destruction which followed the conquest of Jerusalem by Titus was not complete was also a result of other factors. Many people did not actively participate in the rebellion and after the war they rearranged their lives to conform with the situation that had been created and they maintained peace with the Romans. But the zealots who participated in the war were branded as bandits after the conflict. Their desparation in the struggle also harmed the interests of the people and hastened the ultimate destruction.
Titus and the rulers that immediately followed him did not intend to interfere with the religious practices of the Jews. According to Josephus, Titus even commanded that the temple be spared and it was the princess Berenice who set fire to it out of conviction that the Jews would never surrender as long as it remained in existence. After the revolt was quelled Titus did not wish to do any further harm. In all religious matters the Jews remained free and they retained the right of judgment in religious and also in secular cases. Even non-Jews often appeared before a Jewish court when in dispute with a Jew and the Roman authorities allowed Jewish courts to handle all cases when both parties consented to be tried by it. The Church-father Origines even declared that Jewish courts tried cases involving life although they were not authorized to do so.
The teachings of the Pharisees then developed to an extent which would have been impossible had the temple been in existence. The Sadducees disappeared altogether and the oral law became the dominant influence in Jewish life. All national life concentrated about the religious regulations which were strictly observed. In their devotion to the Torah and in the observance of its commandments the people found consolation for the destruction of the temple; Jabneh took the place of Jerusalem and the offering of gifts to the scholars in Jabneh took the place of the offering of sacrifices on an altar.
Sixty years after the destruction of Jerusalem, during the reign of Hadrian, another uprising took place which affected the whole people. The cause of this uprising is sought in the events which occurred during the reign of the preceding emperor Trajan. During his reign Babylonia rebelled against Rome and the Jews extended aid to the insurgents. (The Talmud refers to this revolt as “Polemos Quietus.”) A number of Jews from Palestine also joined this uprising in the hope that the defeat of the Romans would lead to the liberation of Palestine.
Trajan entrusted the conduct of the war to general Lucius Quietus and he commanded him to execute all Jews that would fall into his hands. After he quelled the revolt, Quietus was appointed governor of Palestine. Uprisings of the Jews occurred simultaneously in Egypt, Cyrenaica and Cyprus and the rebels vented their pent up anger on the neighboring Greek population and slaughtered many of them. Greek authors of that time speak of hundreds of thousands of slain Greeks, but these numbers were undoubtedly highly exaggerated. Marcius Turba was dispatched to quell the revolt and he triumphed over the Jews in “Bikat Yadaim” (Alexandria). A Talmudic legend describes the slaughter that followed and states that twice as many people as left Egypt were killed at that time.
Hadrian was by nature a peace loving and kindly man and he is said to have permitted the restoration of the temple, but the Samaritans objected to such a step and he withdrew his permission. One legend states that when the foundations for the new temple were being excavated flames burst out from the diggings and consumed the laborers. The Jews then asked that the work be stopped because of their belief that this was an omen of God’s desire that the temple should not be rebuilt. However, it has been historically established that the relations between the Samaritans and the Jews during the reign of Hadrian were friendly and they also participated on the side of the Jews during the uprising.
Recent historical investigations ascribe the rebellion to Hadrian’s prohibition against circumcision. Both the Jews and the Samaritans observed the law of circumcision and they therefore united against Rome. It seems inexplicable why the Romans, who did not interfere with the religious customs of the subject peoples, should have prohibited circumcision, but the Christian historian Schuerer explains this in the following manner: Emperor Domitian issued a law against castration as a barbaric custom. This law Hadrian extended to include circumcision and the death penalty was established for those who broke the law. This explanation is obviated by the fact that Antoninus Pius again allowed the Jews to practice circumcision and his edict declared the practice to be an old Jewish custom and not to be confused with castration. In issuing this edict he was also influenced by the stubborness with which the Jews clung to this practice.

When Moses sent spies to Palestine they reported that the cities of Palestine were well fortified (Numbers, 13:28). Moses informed the Jews that they would find “cities great and fenced up to heaven” (Deut. 9:1). It is therefore remarkable that after so many invasions and wars the people believed that many of the gates and fortresses dated back to the days of Joshua ben Nun. The Bible mentions that the Jews lived in “Ir” (city), “Chatzer” (court) and “Kefar” (village). The Talmud makes no mention of “Chatzer” but contains the additional concept of “Kerach” (large city) and in addition to the “Ir” (city) it makes mention of “Ayarah” (town). There are differing opinions concerning the exact meaning of “Chatzer”. Some declared it to be a suburb; others maintained that it referred to an enclosure or a group of houses where a large number of people lived. We also find references to cities named “Hatzar” (Numbers, 34:4; Joshua, 19:3), and these probably developed from small groups of houses. The name “Kefar” appears both in the Bible and in the Talmud. The size of a “Kefar” (village) was not definitely determined but Josephus declares that the smallest “Kefar” in Palestine contained fifteen thousand inhabitants. However, his statement may be discounted as exaggerated. There were also cities in Palestine which developed from villages as is indicated by their names: “Kefar Haamoni,” “Kefar Hananiah” and “Kefar Aziz.”
When the scholars tried to define the difference between a city and a village they said that a city is a place where there are always ten “Batlonim” (idlers) available for various religious functions which require that number.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה ג׳ ב׳.</span></i>
The name “Kerach” was derived from the Aramaic. The name signifies a fortified city. The Talmud sometimes refers to the same city by all three names (Kerach, Ir, Kefar), but it is obvious that “Ir” usually referred to an unfortified city.
The fortified “Kerach” was surrounded by a wall as protection against sudden attacks and was generally situated on the top of a mountain or on a rocky hill which was difficult of access and could be easily defended. Whenever an “Ir” was fortified it was expressly referred to as a walled city.
A “Kerach” was limited in area by its walls and could not grow indefinitely; the name therefore described the strength of the city and not its size. Whenever we find statements such as “the great Kerach of Rome” these refer to the defenses of the city rather than to its size.
The Talmud relates that when God wanted to determine the size of Jerusalem the angels said: “You have created so many Kerachim of the Gentile nations without determining their size. Why should you do so for your own city?”<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא ע״ה ב׳.</span></i> This legend is interpreted by some to indicate that “Kerach” referred to Gentile cities or to those whose garrisons were largely non-Jewish. The Talmudic reference to Betar, which was a Jewish city, as “Kerach” they hold to be an exception.
The walled cities of Palestine were thus named “Kerachim” and were considered as Gentile places of residence. There were ten such cities which bore the collective name of Decapolis. In the course of time they developed into separate centers of activity apart from the rest of Palestine,<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שקלים פרק ג׳ משנה ד׳.</span></i> although some of them were surrounded by Jewish settlements.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה כ״ה א׳.</span></i> The administrators of these cities discriminated against the Jews who were denied privileges enjoyed by the other inhabitants. This was also a distinction between a “Kerach” and an “Ir” which was not autonomous. The “Kerach” contained garrisons; this is evident from the reference of the Talmud to “Burganin,” that means the barracks which housed the soldiers or the government tax collector.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ק״ג ב׳.</span></i>
This fact explains the Talmudic saying that a man who is about to enter a “Kerach” should pronounce the following prayer: “May it be Thy will to lead me into this Kerach in peace.” Once within the city one was supposed to recite another prayer which said: “I am thankful to You that You brought me into the city in peace.” Upon leaving, one said: “May it be Thy will to lead me out of this city in peace,” and after one was out of the limits of the city he was to say: “I thank You for leading me out of the city in peace and I pray that You shall further lead me and protect me in peace and that You shall save me from any enemy who may lurk by the roadside.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ס׳ א׳.</span></i>
This prayer was instituted because of the danger of entering and leaving a “Kerach.” It was composed during the rule of the Romans who afforded no protection to Jewish travellers when they did not molest them themselves. But despite the danger, Jews constantly had to visit these cities because of their business enterprises. Sometimes they only had to pass through these cities, as in the case af sea journeys when the ships touched at these ports. The scholars therefore at times forbade entrance into these cities or even into towns which were located in their neighborhood, but these prohibitions were usually ignored out of necessity.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספתא עבודה זרח פרק א׳.</span></i>
Even wicked kings who ruled the land with brutal force and persecuted the Jewish religion could gain the admiration of the people by building a new city. This act was enough to justify many of his cruel deeds in the eyes of the people. Such was the case of Omri, the king of Israel, who encouraged idolatry, nevertheless the Talmud declared that he gained the kingdom for four generations of his successors because he built the city of Samaria.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ק״ב ב׳.</span></i>
The number of cities in Palestine was usually highly exaggerated. Speaking of the conquests of Alexander Jannai, R. Jochanan thus declared that the area occupied contained 600,000 cities each of which was inhabited by 600,000 people. The total number would thus be larger than the population of the whole world today. Similar exaggerations we find in the writing of Josephus who said that there were 1200 cities in Galilee alone and in the writings of the Greek historian Dio Casius who related that during the uprising of Bar Kochba the Romans conquered 950 fortified cities.
We may conclude, however, that the large cities were subdivided into quarters each of which was significant in itself. From the descriptions of ancient Jerusalem we know that the city was divided into an upper and a lower part. During the time that we are dealing with, Jerusalem was in ruins and uninhabited, and when the scholars attempted to describe the beauty of the city they relied upon their imagination of the Jerusalem of the future after Messiah would come. But the descriptions of ancient Jerusalem were not exaggerated. The image of the city lived in the memory of all the people and they sought to make the other cities resemble Jerusalem in appearance. Most of the Palestine cities were built on mountain tops and the synagogues were erected at the highest point so as to be seen from all sides. The court which dispensed justice and controlled the observance of the commandments of the Torah also held its sessions there. The academies were located nearby and the sexton of the synagogue blew the Shofar there to announce the beginning of the Sabbath. The watch tower was also located in that vicinity to observe the countryside over a great distance and to announce the coming of an enemy.
Nearly all Palestine cities had suburbs which were called in Hebrew “Migrash” or “Parvar” (Kings II, 23:11). Houses in these suburbs were part of the cities for purposes of taxation and maintenance of order, but in time of war they were abandoned except such houses as bordered on the city walls.
The scholars established a rule by which all inhabitants of a city were compelled to build a wall with gates about the city. This rule was enforced in those towns that were near the border of the country and were subject to attacks. Every city also had one or more market places and was traversed by streets.
Speaking of the greatness of Jerusalem, a Midrash relates that the city contained twenty-four palaces each of which had 24 entrances. Near every entrance there were 24 large market places, each of which was divided into 24 small ones. Each small market place had 24 courts in each of which there were 24 houses.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">איכה רבתי פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא ב׳.</span></i>
Every market place was usually designated by a name which described the type of merchandise that was sold there. Thus there were poultry markets and fish markets. Others were named after the people that lived in the neighborhood such as “the market of the Arameans.” “the market of Rabbi Yitzchak” and “the market of Rabbi Chanin.” In addition every city had “corners” (Kranoth) where different stores were located and where idlers (<span dir="rtl">יושבי קרנות</span>) congregated awaiting strangers from whom they could earn something.
The <span dir="rtl">״מבוא״</span> (entrance) to the city also served as a market place and frequently resembled a court which extended for some distance and led up to various houses and courts within the city. The “Mavo” was significant and played an important role in the development of the rules pertaining to “Eruvin.”<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">The law concerning the transportation of objects from one place to another on Sabbath.</i> The inhabitants living in the neighborhood of the “Mavo” were also responsible for its upkeep.
The Romans were great city builders and they generally laid out new cities in squares. Jewish scholars therefore developed the theory that cities should be built in that form in order to facilitate defining the 2000 ell limit outside of the city which was the distance allowed to walk on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין נ״ג א׳.</span></i> Jews also built the walls surrounding their cities with uneven surfaces. The unevenness of the walls increased their defense capacity and when the enemy attempted to demolish them with iron rams the upper stones would fall on the attackers. The numerous corners and turns in the walls were also strategically important and hard to conquer.
As a result of the limited space within the walled area, houses were built close together and some of them were built into the protecting walls. Such houses generally served as gates to the city. Thus we find that during the conquest of Jericho, Rahab’s house was built into the city wall and it was also said of one of the “Amoraim” of Palestine that the gate of the city led into his house.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שבת פרק ו׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> Some cities had double walls for greater protection in face of a superior enemy. The Romans were in the habit of erecting imposing gates on each side of the city, but such gates were built only in the Gentile inhabited cities. Jewish cities, on the other hand, presented a poor appearance architecturally both in the construction of their houses and protecting walls.
Life in the cities differed greatly from that in the villages so far as food, clothing and general behavior was concerned. Life in the cities was more refined in all its aspects when compared to the primitive mode of life in the villages. For the convenience of the city dwellers there were markets and hostelries where food supplies were sold and travellers were accommodated. These two institutions also served as the foundation for commerce in the country. On certain days of the week the villagers would bring their produce to the cities and would buy those necessities which they could not raise themselves. These market days were called <span dir="rtl">ימי הכניסח</span> (days of entrance) and occurred on Mondays and Thursdays. In honor of the visitors a chapter from the Torah would be read in the synagogue on those days and other religious needs of the villagers would be fulfilled. The court held its sessions and the scholars lectured on religious questions. Friday was another market day when the villagers brought food supplies such as fowl, cattle, fish and wine for the Sabbath. The artisans also had their shops in the city and the villagers paid them for their labor with their farm produce. Among these were also the scribes, the doctors and the teachers.
This trade was defined in the Talmud as “give and take” (<span dir="rtl">משא ומתן</span>) because it largely consisted of barter. It was only rarely that the villagers possessed any money. Cities were generally built near a supply of water, but when there were no springs or wells in the vicinity, water would be brought in pipes or aqueducts from some distance. Many cities also had reservoirs to store water in anticipation of drought or the drying up of wells and the people knew how to utilize water pressure to raise it to higher levels. Some cities had canals for drainage purposes and these canals were also used to bring the water to the fields for irrigation purposes. Wells were provided with buckets for raising the water.
The abundance of water in Palestine enabled people to maintain cleanliness and its effects on the health of the population was noticeable. The need and the justification of baths was recognized by the Talmud and was expressed in the following words: “If a city dweller does not allow his wife to bathe at least once a week or a villager does not allow his wife to bathe at least once in a fortnight the woman may demand a divorce and the full payment of her dowry, likewise if a villager forces his wife to go barefoot three months in succession, or if a city dweller commands his wife to go barefoot one day.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי פּסחים פרק ח׳ הלכה א׳, כתובות פרק ז׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>
Every city was surrounded by fields and in some cases part of the fields were within the city walls. This was also true of wine cellars and threshing floors which sometimes were found within the confines of the city walls. Although numerous trees were grown within the cities the orchards and the gardens were outside the walls. The roads leading through the gardens were often lined with avenues of trees. Torches and oil lamps were used to illuminate the entrances to the courts. These were provided by the owners of the houses at their own expense.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תרומות פרק י״א משנה י׳, פּסחים נ׳ ב׳.</span></i>
In addition to the weekly market days every city had special fairs once a month or once every half year. At these fairs various kinds of merchandise from distant places and foreign lands were sold and money changers (<span dir="rtl">״שולחני״</span>) were present to exchange the coins of the foreign merchant who came to buy Palestine products.
Aside from their economic significance market places were also social centers where people congregated to look at the displays of merchandise and at the artistic arrangement of fruit. The grains most commonly marketed were rye or wheat for bread. In addition there were articles of apparel and flax, wine, wool, leather and slaves. Stores provided the city dwellers with all their needs in addition to the markets. These stores contained all possible articles including arms. In the smaller towns and villages there were also peddlers who carried their wares from house to house and many villagers preferred to dispose of their goods in this manner out of fear of being cheated in the cities.
The more refined tastes of the city people was apparent also in the food which they consumed and the Talmud mentions the difference in the flour which they used as compared to the flour used by the villagers.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים מ׳ א׳.</span></i> A delicacy frequently used at that time consisted of dough baked in honey, but in the cities this was made with much honey while in the villages only a trace of it was used.<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ל״ז ב׳.</span></i> The villagers also ate coarse bread which was not liked in the cities.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין פּ״ב ב׳.</span></i> Similar differences were apparent in the garments worn. The garments of the villagers were primitive and are referred to in the Talmud as <span dir="rtl">בגדי בני חקליתא</span> (garments of the farmers); in the cities various styles were used and it was often impossible to distinguish between the garments of men and women.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת י״א א׳.</span></i>
Difficult as conditions were in the cities, the farming population met with still greater hardships. Their struggle for existence was more arduous and they were also exposed to ridicule. Villagers were called “Am Haaretz” and even those scholars who showed respect for the city artisans often expressed disdain for the “Am Haaretz.” In later years the name “Am Haaretz” was no longer used and <span dir="rtl">״בן כפר״</span> (villager) was substituted instead, but even then it was pointed out that a great difference existed between the city dweller and the villager. The contempt in which the villager was held is apparent from many descriptions and popular sayings of that time. From these it is obvious that only city dwellers were considered as civilized and the rural population was held to be ignorant.
Cities were held to be the home of wisdom and only their inhabitants knew how to show proper respect to scholars and to prominent men. Whenever a villager did not accord the proper respect to one greater than himself, he was not punished and it was ascribed to his ignorance.
The most striking analysis of the difference between city and village inhabitants is contained in the statement of the scholars concerning the prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel both of whom described their visions of God and his heavenly retinue. Isaiah described what he saw as a city dweller who had frequent opportunities to see the king, but Ezekiel described his vision like a villager who may have seen the king only once in his life.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה י״ג ב׳.</span></i>
All political upheavals of that time originated in the cities, for only there the people showed understanding of political events. Villagers were not much concerned with political matters and they suspected everyone of trying to rob them. This state of mind resulted partly from the fact that the country was overrun by Jewish as well as non-Jewish bands of robbers in addition to soldiers, tax collectors and others who prayed upon the villagers.
The entire mode of life of the villagers was thus on a low plane. Their food was poorer, their garments coarse, their furniture made of unplaned boards. The regulations of the Talmud concerning cleanliness of vessels specifically mentions a “bowl of the villagers” which was different from those used in the cities.<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ביצה ל״ב א׳.</span></i>
Villagers were allowed to celebrate Purim earlier than the city celebrations. Although the Book of Esther expressly states that Purim should be observed on the 14th and 15th days of the month of Adar, the Mishna declared that villagers may read the Book of Esther on market day when they come to the city on a Monday or Thursday even when those days are only the 11th, the 12th or the 13th of the month.
As soon as darkness fell, all villagers were afraid to leave their houses because of the wild animals that roamed the land<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> and also for fear of the soldiers and of robber bands. But whereas the soldiers would only rob the farmer and force him to provide all their needs, the robber bands, which were common in peace time as well as during years of war, frequently killed their victims if any resistance was offered. Rabbi Jose ben Chalafta therefore said that the life of a villager might be compared to that of wanderers in the desert who were never sure of their lives, and whose wives and children could be seized.<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין נ״ה ב׳.</span></i>
The doors of city houses were usually locked and when they were open there was always a bell present to announce the visitors. But the houses in the villages were always open and visitors with honest intentions could always be sure of generous hospitality.
But despite the disabilities of the villagers, their mode of life had certain advantages. Due to the crowded conditions in the cities contagious diseases were common and frequent bathing did not counteract them. The disease germs bred in the walls of the houses, as may be seen from the Biblical laws concerning leprosy.
The scholars ruled that every city must possess ten things for the convenience of its inhabitants. These were: a court, a charity fund, a synagogue, a bath house, a comfort station, a doctor, a barber, a scribe, a butcher and a teacher.<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין י״ז ב׳.</span></i> But all of these did not suffice in time of epidemics and the inhabitants sought refuge in the villages.
By far the greatest difference between city and village consisted in matters of administration. The cities possessed courts and a police force to maintain order; each one was also taxed a definite sum for the city government and also for charitable purposes. In the villages, on the other hand, anarchy reigned and he who was more powerful could do as he pleased.
Jews exhibited a dislike for dogs and only in rare cases were dogs allowed in the cities and then they had to be chained. The opinion was common that one who keeps a dog is like one who raises pigs, and stories were related of pregnant women miscarrying when frightened by the barking of dogs.<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא פּ״ג א׳.</span></i> But in the villages dogs were common, especially for herding purposes.
Villages were often traversed by many people when they journeyed in connection with their business enterprises or to announce the regulations of the Sanhedrin. There were also travelers who went about to acquaint themselves with different peoples and lands. All of these found shelter and hospitality in the villages where they stopped overnight for fear of robbers who hid along the highways. Tax collectors especially were subject to such robberies when it was known that they carried considerable sums.

Rabbi Jehudah N'siah the First and His Successors

R<small>ABBI</small> J<small>EHUDAH</small> H<small>A</small>N<small>ASI</small> (R<small>ABENU</small> H<small>AKADOSH</small>) was succeeded by his son Rabban Gamliel to the post of Nasi. Rabban Gamliel (referred to in the Talmud as Rabban Gamliel, the son of Rabbi Jehuda Ha-Nasi) maintained his rule for but a short time, certainly not more than ten years, and was followed by his son Jehudah, whom the Talmud calls Rabbi Jehudah N’siah (or Rabbi Judan) to distinguish him from his grandfather. Historically he is known as Rabbi Jehudah N’siah the First because he was followed by others of the same name.
Rabbi Jehudah N’siah I was the last of the descendants of Hillel who was both head of the Sanhedrin and in charge of the secular administration of the Jewish population. After his death these two offices were separated and were held by different persons. It is impossible to establish the definite dates of these events due to the confusion of the records which resulted from the repetition of names. Frequently it is impossible to determine whether it is the grandfather or the grandson that the records speak of. But despite these discrepancies it is safer to trust the Talmudic sources even when they disagree with the historical dates of the Roman history.
There are numerous indications that Rabbi Jehudah N’siah was a pupil in the academy of his grandfather. At that time it was still allowed for a grandson to bear the name of his grandfather during the latter’s life. As additional substantiation of this fact we find a statement in the Talmud that Hillel, the younger brother of Rabbi Jehudah N’siah, questioned his grandfather in some religious matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא פּ״ג ב׳.</span></i> This leads to the belief that the older brother certainly must have been a pupil of Rabbi Jehudar ha-Nasi. The Talmud also cites differing opinions between grandfather and grandson regarding the necessity of offering tithes from fruit that was bought from a stranger or from a pagan, and this is held to be further proof of the scholastic relationship between the two.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי פּאה פרק א׳ הלכה ה׳, פרק ב׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i> But despite these deductions we can only say with certainty that Rabbi Jehudah was a pupil of his father, Rabban Gamliel, and of Rabbi Chiya.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ביצה פרק א׳ הלכה י״א.</span></i>
Rabbi Jehudah N’siah permitted the use of oil bought from pagans,<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה ל״ה ב׳.</span></i> and also attempted to introduce other reforms pertaining to the laws of marriage and divorce. In these reforms, however, he was thwarted by the opposition of the Sanhedrin. When his disciple, Rabbi Simlai, wished to repeal the prohibition against the use of bread that had been bought from strangers and concerning which there was doubt whether it had been tithed, Rabbi Jehudah objected on the ground that people would say that the court was repealing all prohibitions.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה ל״ז א׳.</span></i>
In previous years enough olives were raised in Palestine so that it was unnecessary to buy oil from pagans and such oil was considered undesirable in the same way that wine made by pagans was not used for fear that it had been used for idolatrous purposes. But during the numerous wars that were fought in the country, the Romans destroyed most of the olive groves and the inhabitants had to resort to buying oil. For this reason Rabbi Jehudah N’siah allowed the use of such oil.
The origin of the prohibition against the use of oil bought from pagans, dates back to the time of Daniel, according to Rav (Aba Arecha). Others maintain that this prohibition was one of the famous eighteen decrees that were promulgated by the scholars prior to the destruction of the Temple. It is related that Rav refused to use such oil even after the prohibition against it was repealed and he was reproved by his friend Shmuel who said to him: “You should eat this oil, otherwise I will declare you to be a ‘dissenting elder’ who refuses to obey the decisions of the court.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי עבודה זרה פרק ב׳ הלכה ט׳, תוספתא עבודה זרה פרק ד׳.</span></i>
It appears that the people clung to the stricter interpretations of the law and the laxity of the religious conduct of the household of the Nasi was the subject of comment throughout the country. When Rabbi Jehudah realized that his household was the talk of the country he commanded that a stricter religious discipline be applied in order to avoid criticism.
The following instances are related in the Talmud. Rabbi Jehudah N’siah and his brother Hillel were once bathing in the bath house of the city of Kabul. The custom of that city did not allow two men to bathe together, and when Rabbi Jehudah heard the people murmuring against him, Hillel immediately left the bath house to avoid all cause of criticism. Another time the two brothers spent the Sabbath in Biri, a city to the north of Safed, and on that day they walked about the streets in their overshoes. They then heard the people exclaiming that such a thing was never seen before and they immediately removed their overshoes and gave them to their servants to carry.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים נ״א א׳, תוספתא מועד קטן פרק ב׳.</span></i>
The people criticised the household of the Nasi for many of its customs which differed from those commonly accepted, but the scholars informed them that some things which were prohibited for the rest of the population were permissible for the Nasi and those about him because they were “close to the government.” They were thus allowed to decorate their wall with various paintings, to use mirrors, to grow their hair long and to study Greek.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שבת פרק ו׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>
Among other attempted reforms, Rabbi Jehudah N’siah also sought to do away with the fast of the ninth day of Ab. Others maintain that he merely wished to do away with the fast on those years when the ninth day of Ab fell on a Saturday and that it would have been unthinkable for him to try to abolish the fast altogether since it was enjoined by the Bible. Rabbi Jehudah also declared that there was no cause for fasting in times when there were no religious persecutions and Jews lived peacefully.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה ה׳ ב׳, ירושלמי מגלה פרק א׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>
It was noted above that the events of this period are highly confused. Much information is lacking and we do not know with any degree of certainty where the last of the N’siim maintained their academies. Of Rabbi Jehudah N’siah it was said that his academy was located in Sephoris; others maintain that it was in Tiberias. The city of Tiberias was held to be unclean because of the belief that it was built on the site of a cemetery. Rabbi Jehudah thus removed the taboo from this city by holding his academy there. Even the ceremony of the “consecration of the month,” which was always held in a city of Judea, Rabbi Jehudah performed in Tiberias.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי סנהדרין פרק א׳ הלכה בי.</span></i>
Like his grandfather, Rabbi Jehudah N’siah was also called Rabbi or Rabenu. This appellation which was applied to both grandfather and grandson still further confuses the records. The historian Graetz thus maintains that the Talmudic story of the friendship of Rabbi and emperor Antoninus refers to Rabbi Jehudah N’siah and Alexander Severus.
History records that Alexander Severus was a Roman of Syrian birth. He ruled from 222 until 235 (C.E.) and was friendly to the Jews. His bedroom was said to contain the statues of Orpheus, Jesus and Abraham. On all occasions he repeated the maxim of Hillel: That which you would not have done to yourself, do not unto others. He also commanded that this maxim be engraved on the gates of all courts and whenever his legions were about to march, a herald pronounced these words to the soldiers that they might remember them.
Being a friend of the Jews and Christians (who were then still considered to be a Jewish sect) he always set them up as an example of honesty and moral conduct. The Greeks of Antioch and Alexandria therefore ridiculed him and called him “Imperator Archisynagogos,” but although the emperor knew of this attitude of the Greeks he did not deviate from his path. He presented the synagogue at Tiberias with a golden Menorah and he gave the Nasi a large field for the maintenance of his pupils. The friendly attitude of the emperor brought about more cordial relations between the Romans and the Jews and Christians. The Christian Church-father Origines complained in his writings that the emperor thought more like a Jew than a Roman.
It was characteristic of Rabbi Jehudah N’siah that he did not distinguish between scholars and ordinary people in administrative matters and he taxed everyone equally for the government of the city of Tiberias. This was against the accepted axiom that one who undertakes the burden of the Torah should be freed from the burden of the government. Many of the scholars therefore spoke against the Nasi and on one occasion, as they studied the laws pertaining to a Nasi who commits a transgression, Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish asked: “If a Nasi has committed a transgression, should he be flogged or not?” He was answered that a court of three judges could condemn such a Nasi to be flogged and that it was not even necessary to convoke the small Sanhedrin of 23 members to try him.
Later Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish further asked whether a Nasi who had been flogged could be reinstated to his office. One of the pupils, Rabbi Chagai, replied that such a Nasi could not be reinstated for fear that he would execute his judges.
When Rabbi Jehudah N’siah heard of this discussion he understood that it was directed against himself and he sent one of his non-Jewish soldiers to seize Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish, but Rabbi Simeon escaped.
The following day Rabbi Jochanan came to the academy and before the studies were begun he pretended to look in all the corners of the buildings. When he was asked by the Nasi what he was searching for, Rabbi Jochanan answered: “I search for Ben Lakish; we cannot begin our studies without the key.”
“Where is Ben Lakish without whom we cannot pursue our studies,” the Nasi asked, and Rabbi Jochanan replied that he was hiding in Magdala. They then decided to go to Magdala on the following day to bring Ben Lakish back.
Rabbi Jochanan at once sent a messenger to announce the good news to Ben Lakish and when they met on the following day Ben Lakish said to the Nasi: “You have this day done an act which is similar to that of the Creator. When God wanted to free his people from bondage he did so Himself and not through a messenger or an agent.” The Nasi asked him why he proposed his questions in the academy in a manner that would insult the Nasi and Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish replied: “You must not think that out of fear of you I will refrain from studying God’s Torah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי סנהדרין פרק ב׳ הלכה א׳, הוריות פרק ג׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>
Another time Jose the Maonite expounded the fifth chapter of Hosea and remarked that there would come a time when God would bring the priests to trial and He would ask them why they did not observe his Torah after He had granted them 24 priestly gifts. The priests would then reply: “Creator of the world! You have given us nothing.” God would then go to the Jews and ask them: “Why did you not give to the priests the 24 gifts which I have commanded in my Torah?” and the Jews would reply: “Because the servants of the Nasi take everything away from us.”
The Nasi wanted to punish Jose the Maonite for these words, but Rabbi Jochanan and Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish pleaded with him and said: “Jose the Maonite wished to explain a difficult passage in the Bible; would you punish him for it?” The Nasi summoned Jose the Maonite and during their conversation he asked him the meaning of the verse “As is the mother so is her daughter” (Ezekiel, 17:44). Jose replied: “As is the generation, so is its Nasi and as is the altar such are its priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי סנהדרין פרק ב׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i>
* * *
Rabbi Jehudah N’siah I was succeeded by his son Rabban Gamliel IV; Rabban Gamliel IV was followed by his son Rabbi Jehudah N’siah the Second.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ג׳ הלכה א׳, תוס׳ עבודה זרה ל״ג ב׳.</span></i>
Nearly 80 years passed from the rule of Rabbi Jehudah N’siah I until the administration of Rabbi Jehudah N’siah II. Lack of documentary information makes it impossible for us to fit the events of these years into the historical frame work of the Roman empire of that period. It is also entirely possible that due to the political changes there was an interregnum in the rule of the N’siim. It is also noteworthy that Rabbi Jehudah N’siah II was only nominally Nasi, for although he was recognized by the government as head of the Sanhedrin, the religious authorities of the people were Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Jochanan. We may assume that even Rabban Gamliel IV did not make any religious decisions without consulting the opinion of other scholars. Rabban Gamliel was looked upon as a mediocre man and a similar attitude was shown toward Rabbi Jehudah N’siah II who always sought the advice of Rabbi Ami. When Rabban Gamliel asked Rabbi Abahu whether it was permissible to go to a Gentile fair to buy slaves, the latter sharply responded in the negative.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי עבודה זרה פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
On another occasion, when the land was affected by a drought, Rabbi Jehudah N’siah declared thirteen fast days but still no rain fell. He was ready to declare still more fast days, but Rabbi Ami sent him a message saying that it was enough and that since the first thirteen fast days did not produce the desired effect, additional ones would be of no avail.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית י״ד ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jehudah N’siah was a pupil of Rabbi Jochanan. On one occasion he declared so himself and the Talmud also relates that on a certain evening Rabbi Jochanan came to the gardens of Rabbi Jehudah to teach his men how to clean the plow shares.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה כ׳ א׳, ירושלמי עבודה זרה פרק ב׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i> It is further told that when the pupils of Rabbi Chanina explained a law contrary to the opinions of Rabbi Jochanan, Rabbi Jehudah sent soldiers to enforce the decisions of Rabbi Jochanan.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדה נ״ב א׳.</span></i>
Meanwhile scholarship declined in Palestine. The political unrest in the country and the growing weakness of the Roman empire resulted in a chaotic state of affairs. Emperors changed frequently and the central government lost much of its ability to govern lands as distant as Palestine. Babylonia then developed into a center of Jewish learning and in Palestine academies existed only in Galilee. But the Jews of Babylonia continued to cherish a great love for the Land of Israel and they still believed that one who would be a scholar must go to Palestine. Various anecdotes then became current in each country about the inhabitants of the other.
Determining the day of the new month was then a most important religious question. This day could be determined only on the basis of the testimony of witnesses who declared that they had seen the new moon. This became a very difficult procedure due to the interference of the Romans and also because of internal enemies. The beginning of the months of Tishri and Nisan were especially significant because the date of the Passover and leap years were then established. Rabbi Ami insisted on maintaining the old procedure, but Rabbi Jehudah N’siah reminded him of the ruling of Rabbi Jochanan that one must be so strict with the witnesses who testify about the new moon, that even if they had not seen it in time they should declare that they had.<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה כ׳ א׳.</span></i>
It is told that Rabbi Jehudah N’siah devoted much time and energy to the establishment of schools for children and academies for adults in all corners of the land. To achieve this aim he sent out three scholars (R. Ami, R. Asi, and R. Chiya bar Aba) to investigate the situation and he instructed them that wherever they would find a city without a school and an academy they should call the elders and inform them that any city where the children do not study should be destroyed.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ט ב׳, ירושלמי חגיגה פרק א׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i>
The administration of Rabbi Jehudah N’siah occurred during the reign of Diocletian who was born in Dacia and rose from the common people. Diocletian decided that it was too great a task for one man to conduct the numerous Roman wars and to rule the empire at the same time. He therefore selected men to assist him; these were called “Anti-Ceasar.”
Some historians claim that Diocletian was friendly to the Jews and it is true that there is no record of any unusual persecution during his reign. But the Christian Church-father Eusebius relates that Diocletian persecuted the Christians. This is hard to explain in view of the fact that the Christians were then still considered to be a Jewish sect. This hatred of Christianity is ascribed to Diocletian by some historians as due not to religious fanaticism but to the realization that the Christians aimed to destroy the ruling religion. He therefore forced them to worship idols and commanded that all Christian churches be closed. From Jewish sources we learn that Diocletian also persecuted the Samaritans in Palestine and forced them to offer sacrifices to Roman idols. It is even said that he forced all the peoples of the empire, with the exception of the Jews, to worship the idols and to pour wine before their images. The Samaritans obeyed and since that time the wine of Samaritans was prohibited to Jews as unclean.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי עבודה זרה פרק ה׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>
The favorable position of the Jews aroused the envy of their neighbors and in order to undermine the friendship of the emperor it was reported to him that the Jews ridiculed his low origin and referred to him as the “swine-herd.”
A Talmudic legend relates that when Diocletian was a swine-herd the pupils of Rabbi Jehudah N’siah mocked him and even beat him. After he was elected emperor he remembered the insults that were his share and when he visited a Palestinian city a few miles from Tiberias he sent a letter to the Nasi commanding him to appear before him on a Saturday night together with a group of his scholars. The messenger was instructed to deliver the letter on the eve of the Sabbath so that the Nasi would have no opportunity to leave at once. Heavy punishment was threatened to the Nasi and the scholars if they delayed their appearance.
The legend continues that a miracle occurred and the Nasi together with his companions appeared before the emperor on time. A spirit named “Antigris” carried them to the emperor immediately after the “Havdalah.” When their coming was announced, the emperor declared that he would not see them until after they bathed and he comanded that a bath be heated for them for seven days and seven nights so that they may die of the heat. But the same spirit cooled the bath before they entered it, and when they finally appeared before the emperor he asked them whether they allowed themselves to ridicule the emperor because of their assurance that miracles would occur to them. The scholars replied that the Jews only ridiculed the swine-herd Diocletian but not the emperor Diocletian.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי תרומות פרק ח׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>
We have noted before that the family of the Nasi was no longer outstanding in scholarship and its religious authority almost vanished entirely. But the adherence of the people to the dynasty of the Nasi remained steadfast. As long as the Nasi was descended from Hillel, who traced his descent from king David, the people felt that they had a ruler of the royal house of David whose power was temporarily limited by the Romans. The people considered it to be their duty to provide the needs of the Nasi and to maintain him in the greatest honor. As long as one of the seed of David still lived, their independence was not entirely lost.
The Roman government sought to press as much money as they could out of the Jews and the tax collectors were avoided as often as was possible, but for the needs of the Nasi everyone gave as much as was asked and even more than was asked. When the Nasi sent out his messengers to announce the religious decisions of the Sanhedrin, the messengers were received with great honors and were given valuable gifts to take to the Nasi that he might be able to conduct his office without worry.
When Rabbi Jehudah N’siah I died, Rabbi Jannai Rabah announced in the academy that all regulations affecting the priests were done away with for that day and that priests could participate in the rites for the dead. But when Rabbi Jehudah N’siah II died no such reverence was shown and some of the scholars even allowed themselves to joke at the funeral.<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ו׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
* * *
Rabbi Jehudah N’siah II was followed by three N’siim of the house of Hillel concerning whom we would have known nothing were it not for the Christian Church-father Epiphanos who wrote about them. Church-father Epiphanos thus saved the history of these N’siim from oblivion even as Josephus saved for future generations the chronicle of many of the events which transpired during the time of the second temple. Epiphanos appeared to have been born a Jew and he described the history of the N’siim in the belief that those were the last days of the Jewish faith. In this respect he also resembled Josephus who believed that he was writing the history of a people doomed to extinction.
Rabbi Jehudah N’siah II was followed by his son Rabban Gamliel V. Rabban Gamliel was succeeded by Rabbi Jehudah N’siah III who was thirteen generations removed from Hillel. The Talmudic records about this Rabbi Jehudah are very meager and he is mentioned together with Rabbi Jeremiah<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי מגלה פרק ג׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i> or Rabbi Ami<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי עבודה זרה פרק ה׳ הלכה ט״ו.</span></i> which is our only basis for concluding that it was Rabbi Jehudah III that was being referred to. The events mentioned in connection with his name also do not coincide with the period of his predecessors.
Due to the political alignment in Palestine, Rabbi Jehudah III lived in Caesarea where Rabbi Abuah headed the academy. Previous N’siim lived either in Sephoris or in Tiberias.
But despite the unfavorable political and economic situation of the Jews, the Nasi still occupied an exceptional position and he was immune in his person. His decisions in religious matters were binding. The Nasi had to assist in the collection of the taxes from the Jews and he had the right to collect money for the needs of his household. He also had the right to ordain his disciples and to excommunicate those who joined the Christians.
Until the year 325 (C.E.) the Christians were considered to be a Jewish sect and they had a large following in the country. Debates between the orthodox and Christian Jews were a common occurrence and both groups sought substantiation for their beliefs in the Bible.
Oppressed by heavy taxes and other political and economic persecutions, the condition of the people grew worse from day to day but their spirit was not broken as long as their religious life could continue in its traditional channels. In this respect the situation took a radical turn for the worse with the accession of Constantine to the throne of Rome (306-337). Constantine embraced Christianity and established it as the state religion. Persecution of the Jews on religious grounds was then intensified. The council of the Christian Patriarchs was then held at Nicea and this gathering severed all bonds with the Jews. The emperor lent his aid to the Christian church in its persecution of all other religions. Constantine II who ruled together with the co-emperor Gallus (337-349) revived the policies of Hadrian in not allowing the Jews to practice their religious commandments. Gallus was especially known for his brutality to the Jews. Upon his return from a war in the east he laid waste the southern half of the country, and it seemed that this region which contained many educational institutions headed by the disciples of Rabbi Jehudah, would never be rebuilt
Under these circumstances the secular power of the N’siim was diminished to a minimum. The population lost much of its interest in legal matters and devoted itself primarily to Hagada with its fantastic interpretations. The scholars of Palestine lost the creative powers of the previous generations. There was also not much time to devote to such matters, for everyone was concerned with finding a way to escape from the country. The population became impoverished and Rabbi Levi said: “Years ago, when people had money they were interested in the Mishna, Halacha and Talmud; but now that they are poor they do not want to hear of legal matters and are only interested in blessings and consolation.”<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שיר השירים רבה פּרשה ב׳ פּיסקא י״ב.</span></i>
The study of the Bible, however, was widespread. Those who leaned toward Christianity studied it to prove their contentions and the others studied it in order to be able to refute the Christians. Thus Rabbi Abahu, who was a disciple of Rabbi Jochanan, declared: “The people of Palestine study the Bible and are acquainted with all its books and they can explain everyone of its verses because of their constant debates with the Minim (Jewish Christians) on the basis of the Bible.”<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה ד׳ א׳.</span></i>
The study of Halacha thus declined and only those who survived from the days of Rabbi Jehudah N’siah I understood it fundamentally. The other scholars were mediocre people and exhibited no penetrating logic. They merely gathered the statements and opinions of the previous generation without analyzing their content and without questioning their validity. They did not seek to solve the problems which arose in their day, nor did they ponder the words of their predecessors. They were satisfied to know the simple meaning of the laws which they had received.
The situation was entirely different in Babylonia. There “Sophistry” was engaged in extensively and for this reason the Palestinians often mocked the Babylonians and said that “there is no study of the Torah that can compare with the study of the Torah in Palestine and there is no wisdom like the wisdom of Palestine.”<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ט״ז פּיסקא ז׳.</span></i>
Although the Jews of Palestine realized that scholarship was on the decline, they were still proud of their heritage and they were convinced that the handful of scholars in Palestine outweighed those of Babylonia. They said: “The small group of scholars in Palestine is of greater significance than a large Sanhedrin in a foreign country.”<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי נדרים פרק ו׳ הלכה ט״ז.</span></i> Palestine scholars did not allow their pupils to emigrate, and when Rabbi Simeon bar Aba asked Rabbi Chanina bar Chama whether he should go to Babylonia and he requested a letter of recommendation, Rabbi Chanina refused to give him such a letter not wishing to see a promising pupil leave the country.<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי מועד קטן פרק ג׳ הלבה א׳.</span></i>
The increasing lack of interest in Halacha and the difficult situation of the country led to the emigration of many scholars despite the opposition of others. This attitude toward Halacha is illustrated in the following story: “Rabbi Abahu and Rabbi Chiya bar Aba once came to a city where Rabbi Abahu lectured in Hagada and Rabbi Chiya expounded Halacha. All the inhabitants of the city came to hear Rabbi Abahu but Rabbi Chiya had no audience. Rabbi Chiya was greatly hurt and Rabbi Abahu consoled him by saying that but few people go to buy valuable diamonds and pearls but everybody readily buys cheap toys.”<sup class="footnote-marker">30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה מ׳ א׳.</span></i>
But Palestine still maintained a position of authority. Legal decisions were sent from Palestine to Babylonia<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא קכ״ז ב׳.</span></i> touching upon various prohibitions and permissions and also on money matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">32)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא קנ״ח ב׳.</span></i> No one in Babylonia dared to question the validity of these decisions.<sup class="footnote-marker">33)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קט״ו א׳, בבא בתרא מ״א ב׳, סנהדרין כ״ט א׳.</span></i> The decisions of the Palestine scholars in the matter of the determination of the date of the new month and of leap years were especially adhered to even after the scholars of Babylonia had learned to calculate the calendar and could determine these dates without having to wait for word from Palestine that the new moon had been seen.<sup class="footnote-marker">34)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה כ׳ א׳, ירושלמי ערובין פרק ג׳ הלכה ט׳.</span></i>
Thirteen generations after Hillel the Old, another Hillel, the son of Rabbi Jehudah N’siah III, was elected Nasi. Of his activities we only know that in the year 359 (C.E.) he finally solved the problem of a calendar by basing it on exact calculations. The new calendar was to be permanent and all holidays were to be determined by it. The book of genealogy lists the following as the last N’siim: R. Hillel II, R. Gamliel V, R. Jehudah N’siah IV, and R. Gamliel VI (or Bathraah—the last). About sixty years passed from the time of Hillel II till R. Gamliel the VI, and this period was a very difficult one since it coincided with the rise of Christianity to power.
The political decline of the Jews began during the reign of Constantine the Great and continued at an eccelerating pace. During the first years of his rule Constantine was quite tolerant to the Jews and he repealed the limitations which were imposed by Diocletian. He was then convinced that every man should have the right to choose his own faith and he also freed the Jewish scholars and all “the servants of the synagogue” from payment of taxes to the government. He recognized the Nasi as the head of the Jewish religious community and teachers of Jewish law were commanded to obey his edicts. But this liberalism of the emperor was not of long duration and soon after he embraced Christianity, he fell under the influence of religious fanatics and he was guided by them in his policies toward the Jews. The emperor’s religious advisers followed the leadership of Bishop Sylvester of Rome, Bishop Paul of Byzantium and Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea. It was they who called the attention of the emperor to the belief that the Jews were a cursed and forsaken people condemned to suffering. They insisted that since the emperor had seen the light and had embraced the only true faith, he had to abstain from the sin of protecting the Jews.
Constantine then ruled that Jews could not convert others to their faith, and if they did, both parties were to be punished. A free man who embraced Judaism was to lose all his property and a non-Jewish slave who was circumcised against his will was to be liberated. If a Jew who embraced Christianity was persecuted by other Jews, his tormentors were to be burned at the stake.
All these years of persecution were only broken for a brief moment by the short-lived reign of Julian the Apostate who ruled for 18 months (Nov. 361—June 363). In his struggle against Christianity Julian befriended the Jews. He reduced the burden of their taxes, he did not allow them to be insulted and he called the Nasi “Honored friend and brother.” In a letter to the Nasi Rabbi Hillel, he promised to improve the condition of the Jews and to permit the rebuilding of the temple after his return from the war with the Persians.
After Hillel II the post of Nasi was occupied by his son Gamliel V. The Christian Church-father Hieronymus relates that Emperor Theodosius the Great, who ruled from 378 till 395, took the part of the Nasi against the Roman consul in Palestine, who infringed upon his rights, and had him executed.
R. Gamliel V was succeeded by Rabbi Jehudah N’siah IV. The son of Rabbi Jehudah, Rabbi Gamliel VI, was the last Nasi. In his time the Roman empire was divided into two parts—eastern Rome with the capital at Constantinople (395-1453) and western Rome with its old capital (395-476). Rabbi Gamliel the last is mentioned in the decrees of emperor Honorius (395-424) and of Theodosius II (408-450).
There is also in existence a decree of the year 426 which commands that all the payments which the Jews of Palestine made to the Nasi should henceforth be paid to the imperial treasury. This decree was probably issued at the death of Rabbi Gamliel. Rabbi Gamliel the Sixth died childless and with him the dynasty of Hillel came to an end.
Thus we find that although the Nasi was recognized by the government at all times his significance in the eyes of the Jews diminished toward the end. In religious matters he was no longer the highest authority and his political influence with the Roman officials was negligible. His only important religious functions were the consecration of the new month, the sending of messengers to report the appearance of the new moon, questioning the witnesses and the determination of the holidays and the leap years. Traditionally all of these had to be determined in the presence of the Great court in Palestine in order to be valid.
The Romans frequently seized the messengers that were sent to announce these matters to the scholars in Babylonia which was outside the boundaries of the Roman empire. Whenever caught the messengers were hanged and few people volunteered for such dangerous work. Although the Babylonian scholars could calculate the time of the holidays and the leap years, they were not allowed by tradition to determine these occasions on the basis of their calculations. Thus it once occurred that throughout the month of Adar it was impossible to send messengers to Babylonia to announce that a leap year had been declared. Only late in the summer there were found people who were willing to risk their lives in this mission and the Babylonian Jews observed the month of Ab twice in order that the New Year might coincide with that in Palestine. The messengers were given a letter written in code so that in case they were caught the Romans should not be able to understand its contents. The letter read and was interpreted as follows: “A pair (two witnesses) came from Reketh (Tiberias) and they were caught by the eagle (the Romans) who found in their possession things that are made in Luz (Tzitzith). Through God’s mercy and because of their own merit they escaped in peace (from the hands of the Romans). The descendants of Nachshon (the Nasi who was descended from the tribe of Judah) wanted to decide upon a crescent (declare a leap year), but the Idumean (the Roman) did not permit them. But the men of the assemblies gathered and declared a crescent for the month that Aaron died (the month of Ab).<sup class="footnote-marker">35)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין י״ב א׳.</span></i>
The function of determining new months and leap years lent some prestige to the Nasi and he had to be looked up to as the religious leader. But when Rabbi Hillel II established a permanent calendar he did away with the last important role of the Nasi. The office of Nasi thus became an empty title. The government looked upon the Nasi as upon a Jewish official, but the Jews could see no use in maintaining the office. Emperor Theodosius issued a decree that “whoever insults the Nasi should be heavily punished.” From other sources we may conclude that this decree was aimed primarily at the Jews.
We have previously recounted some of the laws promulgated by Constantine against the Jews, especially in relation to their attitude toward converts to Christianity. When he was informed that the Jews were planning a revolt against Rome he issued a decree prohibiting them from approaching the gates of Jerusalem. He also exhibited a certain sense of justice in not repealing a previous order which freed scholars and servants of the synagogue from taxes. In 336 he also ruled that Jews who embraced Christianity must not insult or do harm to their previous co-religionists.
This law was very timely because new converts to Christianity persecuted the Jews, and before the latter could get redress from the governor or the emperor, much harm was accomplished. Such was the case of one Joseph of Tiberias who was considered to be one of the scholars of the court of the Nasi. The Nasi trusted him and sent him to gather the offerings of the people. When Joseph came to Cilicia in Asia Minor, it became obvious from his lectures that he was no longer an adherent of Judaism and the people would pay no attention to him. Joseph then said that he had been thrown into a river and was only saved through a miracle. After he openly embraced Christianity, the priests interceded for him with the emperor and he was appointed in charge of the new converts. Utilizing the confidence of the Emperor, Joseph fabricated numerous false stories about the Nasi and he particularly tried to convince the emperor that the Jews were planning revolt.
The rumor of a planned revolt must have been based on some truth. We find that in 351 an attempt was made to overthrow the Romans. The records of that rebellion, both Jewish and non-Jewish, are very inadequate, but even from these meager sources we can obtain a picture of the events.
The uprising began in the city of Sephoris which was a natural fortress. The Jews overwhelmed the Roman garrison of that city on a dark night and with the weapons which they seized they attacked other cities and succeeded in capturing Tiberias and Lud. Constantine II (350-361) dispatched several legions which subdued the uprising and mercilessly persecuted the rebels. Sephoris was destroyed entirely. Tiberias, Lud and southern Palestine were laid waste. The pursuit of the rebels continued until they were annihilated.
The Roman commander Arsikanus was especially severe with the inhabitants of Sephoris who were forced to hide in the caves about Tiberias. Some of them tried to mask their faces in order not to be recognized, but numerous informers reported them to the authorities.<sup class="footnote-marker">36)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי יבמות פרק ט״ז הלכה א׳, סוטה פרק ט׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>
Because of the great perils that attended the announcement of the new months and leap years Rabbi Hillel II decided to do away with the traditional procedure and he established a permanent calendar. It was thus no longer necessary to question witnesses concerning the appearance of the new moon nor to send messengers to announce the findings to the Jews of foreign countries. In the matter of holidays, Jews in foreign countries were freed from the decisions of the “Great Court” in Palestine.

The Hagadah and Its Authors

T<small>HE</small> H<small>AGADIC PART OF THE</small> T<small>ALMUD</small> consists of the interpretations of the texts of the Bible as well as of legendary and poetic descriptions of historical events in so far as these were not concerned with the law. It was the aim of the Hagada to inspire the people with higher moral concepts and to revive their courage during times of oppression.
Throughout the numerous generations of Amoraim there were many scholars who underestimated the worth of the Hagada and even opposed it. Such opposition, however, remained ineffective. The demands of the people were stronger than scholastic theories. The masses yearned for words of consolation and they eagerly listened to the teachings of the Hagada.
The economic and social pressure which resulted from the political developments, the constant impoverishment of the people and the burden of submission to foreign rulers weakened the interest in Halacha. A much more receptive attitude was maintained toward Hagada which caressed the fantasy and in times of sorrow it inspired hope for a brighter future. Even during the brief intermission when the situation of the Jews of Palestine improved, as during the reign of Alexander Severus, Rabbi Jehudah, then Nasi, complained of the suffering inflicted by the government which forced him to take the last earnings of the people for the payment of taxes. In an attempt to increase its taxes, the Roman government once issued an edict that Jews should cultivate their fields on the Sabbatical year and the scholars had to give their consent, otherwise the people would have been unable to pay their taxes.
But such respites in the long chain of oppression which did occur were short lived and were intended to allow the people to recuperate and to prepare them to bear patiently the decrees that inevitably followed. It is also remarkable that the rich as well as the poor suffered equally whenever the Romans intensified their oppression. The rich were sentenced to death for not giving all that was asked of them and the poor met a similar fate for not having anything to give.
All of these facts we learn from casual remarks in the Talmud and the Midrashim which are attached to various legal opinions. The scholars of that time did not appreciate the importance of recording the events, and when it was remarked that future generations would not know what had occurred, the answer was given that “even if we should want to record everything we could not do so.”
Considering the unbearable position of the Jews at that time, it is therefore quite understandable why they thirsted for consoling words and why they so eagerly turned to the Hagada. But the masses of the people were not alone in this respect; their leaders also sought momentary respite from the bitterness of their fate. The Hagada offered them all that. It promised a glorious future for the Jews, it taught them to value their faith, and it assured divine justice and retribution for all the wrongs that they were suffering. The Hagada extolled the virtues of the Jewish nation; it listed the virtues of the Torah and of those who adhered to it; it related the events of the past and inspired courage to face the future.
Not all the legends that were repeated by the scholars were written down and many of them were lost. Others were not concerned with problems of conduct and were considered unimportant. But all those legends that have come down to us are a rich source of ethical maxims and words of wisdom with a definite lesson for every eventuality. In addition they also explain many passages of the Bible which would otherwise remain inexplicable. Some of the legends may appear to be of minor worth today, but this is due to the fact that we do not understand them. Others are based on events of which we have no record or on events which we cannot conceive of today.
The authors of the Hagada are usually known as the <span dir="rtl">רבנן דאגדתא</span> (teachers of the Hagada). Some of these also engaged in legal discussions and looked to the Hagada as a means of refreshing the minds of their pupils when they showed signs of weariness of the “Sophistry.” There were some scholars who looked at the teachers of Hagada with a lack of respect; they refused to call them “Rabbi” and merely referred to them as “the men of Hagada.”
Aside from the above mentioned purposes the Hagada also served to protect the Jews from Christian teachings which became common at that time. It taught them how to answer and to refute the arguments of the Christians which were based on the Bible. As long as the Christians were considered to be a Jewish sect and they preached moral principles which did not threaten the fundamental tenets of the faith, they were tolerated. But when they began to claim that God had repudiated the Torah and for this reason he had destroyed the temple they became a menace to the Jewish religion. When the Christians sent apostles to win the nations to their faith and these apostles were successful because they repudiated the Sabbath, the laws of cleanliness and circumcision, the scholars feared that Jews also might be misled.
One must also bear in mind that the Jewish method of interpreting the Bible was also used by many Christians of that time. The difference consisted in that the Hagada never assumed the authority of law among Jews while many of the principles of Christianity were founded on such interpretations. Not only Jewish born Christians but also non-Jews who embraced Christianity employed this method of expounding the Old and the New Testaments and even in their attacks on Jews they based themselves on the texts of the Bible.
The Church-father Theophil of Antioch, who was born a non-Jew, thus explained that God was called “Makom” because He contained the whole world within himself but that the world was too small to be the “Makom” (place) of God. Likewise he said that when the animals were created they were powerless to do any harm and only the sin of Adam bestowed this power upon them. Another time he declared that when God said to Adam “Where art thou?” it might seem that He did not know where Adam was, but in reality He said so in order to begin a conversation with Adam and to give him an opportunity to repent.
The Church-father Origines declared that the “Seraphim” which the prophet Isaiah saw in heaven were the Messiah and the personification of the Holy Spirit. He also explained the functions of the angels mentioned in the Scriptures: Raphael was appointed to heal the sick, Gabriel was in charge of wars, and Michael was in charge of the prayers of man.
Hieronimus, the greatest of the Church-fathers, to whom Jews owed a debt of gratitude for preserving the Bible, held forth on the piety of Noah who lived in a generation of wicked men. The passage stating that God created a garden eastward (mikedem) in Eden, he explained to indicate that the garden of Eden was created before the rest of the world.
It would take us too far afield to cite any more interpretations of the Christian Patriarchs (who were born non-Jews) to the texts of the Bible in so far as they resemble those of the Jewish scholars. It is obvious, however, that most of these interpretations were taken from Jewish sources.
Nearly all Christian teachers attempted to prove their contention from the verse “Let us make man.” The use of the plural in this verse, they said, indicated that God consulted with His son when He decided to create man.
Rabbi Shmuel ben Nachmani quoted his teacher Rabbi Jonathan in this matter and said that when Moses had to write this passage in the Torah he said to God: “Lord of the world! Why do you give an opportunity to claims that You had a partner in the creation of man?”, and God answered: “You write as I tell you and those who err shall err.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ח׳ פּיסקא ז׳.</span></i>
The Church-father Justinus the Martyr once asked a Jew with whom he was debating religious matters: “If the commandment of circumcision is so important in the eyes of God, why did He not impose it on Adam?” The same question was once asked by a Min (a Jew who embraced Christianity) of Rabbi Oshaiah and the latter replied: “Why does a man shave the hair on his head but not his beard?” The Min answered: “Because the hair on a man’s head was already growing when he was still a foolish child.”
“Why then does not one gouge out his eyes or cut off his hands because they also were with him when he was still foolish?” Rabbi Oshaiah continued, “the truth of the matter is that whatever had been created by God during the six days has to be improved. Thus wheat has to be ground before it can be used. Likewise the human body has to be improved.”
An outstanding man among the teachers of the Hagada was Rabbi Simlai, a disciple of Rabbi Jehudah N’siah I and a friend of Rabbi Jehudah II whom he accompanied on all his travels. He was a constant companion of the Nasi who always relied upon him. Rabbi Simlai loved the Hagada and although most of his statements were lost we may conclude from the few that remained that his expositions consisted of wise and witty sayings.
Rabbi Simlai said: 613 commandments God gave to Moses; King David reduced them to 11; the prophet Isaiah reduced the commandments to six; Micha limited them to three, and Amos condensed all 613 into one commandment. Rashi comments on this that in earlier generations people were very pious and could observe all 613 commandments, but the later generations were not so pious, and when it is impossible to observe all the commandments it is necessary to be satisfied with fewer.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכות כ״ג ב׳, כ״ד א׳.</span></i>
Characteristic of the condition of his times is his explantation of the passage in Hosea (2:7) as referring to scholars who shame the Torah with their deeds such as people who preach that one must not loan money for interest and yet they do so themselves, that one must not rob yet they rob others or that one must not steal and yet they steal from others.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">דברים רבה פּרשה ב׳ פּיסקא י״ב.</span></i>
Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani, several of whose Halachic opinions are cited in the Talmud, was even greater than Rabbi Simlai in this form of exposition. He loved to compare the virtues of the Jews with those of other peoples and at the same time he praised the Torah and its followers. But the moral life he held to be “even more important than the study of the Torah.” He sought to explain and to justify the sins of the leaders of the nation. He always maintained that the story of these sins must not be taken literally and those who believed that such people as Reuben the son of Jacob, the sons of Eli or king David could have sinned, were in error.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת נ״ו א׳.</span></i>
Even in legal matters he based his arguments on the Hagadic method of interpretation. Thus he said: “How do we know that a court need not listen to the defense of one who incites to idol worshipping? We may learn this from the case of the snake which God cursed for persuading Eve to sin without even giving it an opportunity to defend its act.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין כ״ט א׳.</span></i> When the Mishna ruled that during a public fast ashes had to be placed on the Ark, Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani said that it was necessary to do so in memory of Isaac who allowed himself to be sacrificed and that God might consider the ashes on the Ark as if they were those of the ram which Abraham sacrificed instead of his son.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי תענית פרק ב׳ הלבה א׳.</span></i>
Another bright star in the firmament of the Hagada was Rabbi Levi. He lived during the time of the second and third generations of Amoraim in Palestine. The name of his father is unknown to us, for he is always referred to only by his own name. Like Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani he also found substantiation for legal decisions in the interpretations of Biblical texts. For a long time Rabbi Levi was not appreciated among the scholars. His work then consisted in calling the people to attend the lectures of Rabbi Jochanan. But one time Rabbi Jochanan was late and Rabbi Levi addressed the audience to pass the time until the arrival of Rabbi Jochanan. His words were greatly liked and since then he was allowed to lecture every Saturday in the academy of Rabbi Jochanan.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי סוכה פרק ה׳ הלכה א׳, בראשית רבה פּרשה צ״ח פּיסקא ט״ז.</span></i>
Even Rabbi Zera, who often mocked the “men of Hagada,” asked his friends and colleagues to attend the lectures of Rabbi Levi.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ראש השנה פרק ד׳ הלכה א׳, סנהדרין פרק ב׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i> Rabbi Levi’s interpretations followed an original method and he explained the significance of Biblical words according to their meaning in other languages, particularly Arabic and Greek. He also employed fables which were based on the behavior of men and animals. Thus he related that the lion, the king of the animals, was once angered by his subjects. The animals gathered to decide who should conciliate him and the fox undertook the task. At other times he uttered maxims to guide men in their conduct as when he said that man should eat according to his income, he should dress poorer than his income allows him and he should furnish his house better than his income permits him.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה כ׳ פּיסקא ל׳.</span></i>
Of the verse “if the anointed priest shall sin” he said: “Woe to the city whose doctor is sick and he who has to cure others is himself blind in one eye.” He also said: “The heart and the eye are agents of sin. The eye sees and the heart desires.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק א׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>
“Six limbs serve man,” he said, “three of these he can control but the other three are outside of his control. Man cannot control his eye, for it sees even against his will. The same is true of the ear which hears even when one does not want to. Likewise the nose smells odors which one does not like. The mouth, on the other hand, can be controlled. It may be used for the study of the Torah or it may be employed in gossip. Man also controls his hand to fulfill commandments with it or to steal. The same is true of the foot which leads man wherever he chooses, either into the synagogue and the academy or to see forbidden games.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ס״ו פּיסקא ג׳.</span></i>
In many of his speeches Rabbi Levi sought to inspire the people with courage to bear all vicissitudes in the belief that God would avenge them. At times he also hinted that the Jews were themselves to blame for much of their suffering. Thus he said that when Messiah would come God would throw the Pagans into Gehenna and He would say to them: “Why have you inflicted pain upon my children?” They would then answer: “We would not have inflicted pain upon them if they had not slandered each other.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה כ׳ פּיסקא א׳.</span></i>
The passage “A good name is better than precious ointment and the day of death than the day of one’s birth” (Ecclesiastes, 7:1), Rabbi Levi explained with a parable. Two ships were once on the great sea. One of them was leaving the shore and the other was approaching it. It was then seen that the people on the ship leaving the shore were happy while some of those on the ship nearing the shore were sad. A wise man remarked: “We see here a strange sight. People who leave the shore should not be happy, for they know not how long they will be at sea and what winds they will encounter, but people who near the shore should be happy in the realization that they have safely reached dry land. It is likewise with the life of man. One should not reckon the years he had lived but rather should he reckon the time which still separates him from death.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה מ״ח פּיסקא א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Levi said: “When God commanded Noah to include two of each kind in the ark, falsehood came and wanted to enter, but Noah said to it: ‘You cannot enter, for you have no pair.’ Falsehood then went to search for a mate and it met with sin and asked it whether it would enter the ark with it. Sin asked what it would receive for doing so and falsehood promised that everything which it would earn it would give to sin. When they left the ark, sin seized everything which falsehood had gained, and when falsehood objected, sin reminded it of their compact. Falsehood thereupon said: ‘How could you believe me that I meant to do as I promised?’”<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מדרש שוחר טוב פּרשה ז׳ פּיסקא ט״ו.</span></i>
Another prominent teacher of Hagada was Rabbi Jehudah bar Simon or Rabbi Jehuda ben Pazi, as he is called in the Jerusalem Talmud. (Sometimes also called Rabbi Jehudah ben Rabbi Simeon ben Pazi.) Like some other teachers of Hagada, we also find some of his legal statements in the Talmud, but these are of minor importance. Many of his expositions were not original but were repetitions of those of former scholars which he improved and amplified for the better understanding of his audiences.
Speaking of Adam Rabbi Jehudah said: “God almost decided to give the Torah through Adam and He thought: ‘This man whom I created and who is not of woman born, should I not give the Torah through him?’ But He immediately decided otherwise and said: ‘I gave one commandment to this man that he should not eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge and he failed to obey me. How then can I give him the Torah with its 613 commandments?’”<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה כ״ד פּיסקא ה׳, קהלת רבה פּרשה ג׳ פּיסקא י״ד.</span></i>
Another time Rabbi Jehudah said: “Adam was destined to live forever. Why then was he condemned to die? To inspire people with the fear of God.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קהלת רבה פּרשה ג׳ פּיסקא י״ז.</span></i>
Rabbi Jehudah bar Simon sought to introduce such novel interpretations into the texts of the Bible as would surprise the hearer by their originality and their wondrous nature. Of the passage in Genesis, “And the earth was without form and void,” he said that “without form” referred to Adam who was as nothing after he sinned and “void” referred to Cain who voided the act of creation by killing Abel. “Darkness” referred to the generation of Enosh. “The face of the deep” referred to the generation of the deluge. God’s words “Let there be light” referred to Abraham; “and God called the light day” referred to Jacob; the evening referred to Esau and the morning to Jacob. “One day” referred to the Day of Atonement which God gave to Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ב׳ פּיסקא ד׳.</span></i>
Telling of Sara and the miracles that occurred to her, Rabbi Jehudah declared that many other childless women bore children at the time that Sara gave birth to Isaac; the blind regained their sight and the deaf their hearing and many foolish men gained wisdom.<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה נ״ג פּיסקא י״ב.</span></i>
Rabbi Jehudah referred to the political situation of the Jews on numerous occasions but he could not speak openly on this subject and he limited himself to vague references to the oppressors. “The devouring fire” spoken of by Isaiah (33:4) he explained to mean the enemies of the Jews who would burn the world and all of humanity if they could.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה מ״ח פּיסקא ח׳.</span></i> On the same subject he also said: “The Jews say to God: ‘How many decrees have been enacted against us to make us turn away from your holy name but they were to no avail, for we still come to Your synagogues and academies to announce to the whole world twice each day that You are our only God.”<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שוחר טוב פּרשה ח׳.</span></i>
Once Rabbi Jehudah was asked concerning the Trinity and the verse of Zechariah (13:8) was quoted that “it shall come to pass that in all the land two parts therein shall be cut off and die but the third shall be left therein.” Some Christians explained this verse to indicate that those people who believed in two kinds of gods, such as the Persians who believed in a god of light and a god of darkness, shall perish and only those who believed in the Trinity would be saved. Rabbi Jehudah agreed with them concerning the Persians but the “third” he explained to refer to the Jews who are made up of three groups (Priests, Levites and Israelites) and who praise God by thrice saying Kadosh.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">דברים רבה פּרשה ב׳ פּיסקא כ״ד.</span></i>
With exaggerated love Rabbi Jehudah bar Simon spoke of the Jews and said: “A king once had an orchard in which there grew figs, vines, pomegranates and apples. The king leased the orchard and went away. Sometime later the king returned to see how his orchard was thriving and he found it full of thorns and weeds. In great anger he called men and commanded them to cut down the trees, but when he looked closely between the thorns he noticed a beautiful rose. He bent down over it and inhaled its fragrance and said: ‘Because of this rose I will save the whole orchard.’”
Such was also the case with the world. Twenty-six generations after the creation of the world God saw that its conduct was bad and He decided to annihilate it. But among the thorns He saw a rose, the Jews, who accepted the ten commandments and for their sake He spared the whole world.<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ויקרא רבה פּרשה כ״ג פּיסקא ג׳, שיר השירים רבה פּרשה ב׳ פּיסקא ו׳.</span></i>
The passage “after God you shall follow” Rabbi Jehudah questioned and said: “How can one imagine people following God who makes a way in the sea and a path in mighty waters? How can one cling to the Shechina which is made of fire and which is surrounded by a river of fire? This can only mean that one should imitate the deeds of God. When He created man He immediately planted a garden in Eden, where Adam was. For this reason the Jews were also commanded to plant trees when they came to Palestine.”<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ויקרא רבה פּרשה כ״ה פּיסקא נ׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jehudah further said: “Of three places in Palestine the Pagans cannot say that the Jews have taken them without paying: the cave of Machpelah, the Temple and the grave of Joseph. The Bible expressly states that Abraham bought the cave of Machpelah for four hundred silver shekels. The site of the temple was bought by David from the Jebusite for six hundred golden shekels and of the grave of Joseph it is said that Jacob bought a plot of land from the sons of Chamor for one hundred Kesitah.<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ע״ט פּיסקא ז׳.</span></i>
Another prominent Hagadist was Rabbi Jose ben Chalafta. Rabbi Jose was known also as an authority in Halacha and he strove to eliminate the differences between the school of Shammai and the school of Hillel. He expressed a wish that his share in the life to come should be among those who eat three meals on the Sabbath, who praise God daily, who pray at sunrise, who die of intestinal trouble or on their way to fulfill a commandment, who greet the Sabbath in Tiberias and end it in Sephoris, who seat their pupils in the academy and do not let them stand, who are in charge of charities but not participate in their distribution so that no suspicion is directed against them.<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ח ב׳.</span></i>
In their persecution of the Jews the Romans sought to prevent them from resting on the Sabbath. Rabbi Jose therefore said that “he who observes the Sabbath joyfully, him will God give boundless rewards.” Fasting was prohibited on Sabbath but the persecutions were such that people often had no opportunity to eat on that day and Rabbi Jose said: “He who fasts on the Sabbath will be forgiven all the sins of his seventy years. Nevertheless he will also be punished for disobeying the commandment that one must enjoy himself on that day.”<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ל״א ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jose’s opinions of prophecy was unusual. “All the prophets,” he said, “spoke they knew not what, for the spirit of prophecy spoke out of them and the prophets did not say that which they themselves wanted to say. The only ones who did know what they said were Moses and Isaiah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מדרש שוחר טוב פּרשה צ׳ פּיסקא א׳.</span></i> His appreciation of the greatness of God also expressed itself in his statement that were all the scholars of the world to attempt to create the smallest creature, they would not be able to inspire it with the breath of life.<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי סנהדרין פרק ז׳ הלכה י״ג.</span></i>
It appears that some Gentile scholars asked why God did not choose animals that would symbolize His greatness to be offered to Him as sacrifices. Rabbi Jose replied that God purposely chose the hunted and not the preying animals as sacrifices. The ox runs away from the lion; the goat flees the tiger; the sheep flees the wolf. God chose to honor the hunted animals in order to show his love for the weak.<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ויקרא רבה פּרשה כ״ז פּיסקא ה׳.</span></i>
Prayers had already supplanted sacrifices at that time and many people apparently ignored these in the belief that if prayers had been desired by God He would not have allowed the temple to be destroyed. Rabbi Jose then declared that God also prayed. He arrived at this conclusion from the verse of Isaiah “I will make them joyful in my house of prayer” (56:7). The use of the words “my house of prayer” instead of “their house of prayer,” Rabbi Jose held to be proof that God also prayed.<sup class="footnote-marker">30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ז׳ א׳.</span></i>
“It sometimes occurs,” Rabbi Jose said, “that a man prays to God to help him because of his merit and God heeds his prayer because of the merit of others; or a man prays to be aided because of the merit of others and God aids him because of his own merit. Thus we find that Moses prayed to God to remember the merit of the fathers, but his wish was fulfilled because of his own merit. King Hezekiah prayed to God to aid him in his own merit, but God aided him because of the merit of king David.”<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות י׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Another prominent Hagadist was Rabbi Simeon ben Jehozadak. Some are of the opinion that there were two persons of this name because the references of the Talmud to this man concern events which occurred over a period of several generations. We may be justified in assuming, however, that there was only one man of this name because the name Jehozadak is rare and appears only once in the Bible and in the Talmud. Any discrepancies that have arisen may be ascribed to errors of the copyists.
Two of his statements deal with the honor due to scholars and with the Torah which confers eternal life upon its followers. One of these states that “any scholar who is not vengeful as a snake is not a scholar.”<sup class="footnote-marker">32)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא כ״ג ב׳.</span></i> The other statement says: “Every word which is quoted in the name of a scholar causes the lips of its author to move in the grave.”<sup class="footnote-marker">33)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות צ״ז א׳, סנהדרין צ׳ א׳.</span></i> He also said: “A letter may be omitted from the Torah if in this manner the name of God will be honored publicly.<sup class="footnote-marker">34)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ע״ט א׳.</span></i>
Aside from the teachers of Hagada that were enumerated above there were other Amoraim who devoted themselves to it. Of these we will mention only one, Rabbi Berachiah, a disciple of Rabbi Simeon ben Gamliel. We can do no more than quote some of his interpretations which illustrate his mode of thought.
Of the creation of the world Rabbi Berachiah said: “When God wanted to create man he foresaw that both good and wicked men would be descended from him. He then thought: ‘If I will create man, he will have wicked descendants, but if I am not to create him how will there be just men?’ God then removed the ways of the wicked from his view and donning the ‘measure of pity’ He created man.”<sup class="footnote-marker">35)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ח׳ פּיסקא ד׳.</span></i>
More interesting is Rabbi Berachiah’s interpretation of the verse “Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven” (Psalms, 32:1). He said: “Happy is he who can rise above sin and not that sin should rise above him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">36)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה כ״ב פּיסקא י״א.</span></i>

Rabbi Jochanan, the Compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud

T<small>HE LIFE OF THIS PROMINENT</small> “A<small>MORA</small>” consisted of an unbroken chain of misfortunes. His parents he did not know, for he became an orphan at his birth. His father died before Jochanan was born and his mother died in childbirth.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ל״א ב׳.</span></i> When he came of age and married, Rabbi Jochanan became the father of ten sons all of whom died before him. Rabbi Jochanan then carried about the tooth of his tenth son who had died and he pointed out on all occasions that “this is a bone of my dead tenth son.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ה׳ ב׳.</span></i>
The occupation of Rabbi Jochanan’s father was hinted at when Rabbi Jochanan was called “the son of the blacksmith.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות כ״ה ב׳, בבא מציעא פּ״ה ב׳, סנהדרין צ״ו א׳, ירושלמי ראש השנה פרק ב׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i> Since his father died before his birth, Rabbi Jochanan lived with his grandfather who made him the pupil of Rabbi Simeon bar Elazar.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי מעשרות פרק א׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jochanan was gifted by nature with the highest physical and spiritual qualities. He possessed deep understanding exceeding that of others and he was renowned for his beauty.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי עבודה זרה פרק ג׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> His diligence was also uncommon and love of the Torah filled his whole being. Only once did he forsake study of the Torah when a friend of his named Ilfa, who was older and probably also better educated than Rabbi Jochanan, suggested that they engage in business in partnership. However, this venture did not last long and Rabbi Jochanan soon realized that it was undesirable to leave the permanent values of the Torah for the transitory gains of commerce. He then parted with his friend Ilfa and returned to the academy.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית כ״א א׳.</span></i>
The years of Rabbi Jochanan’s youth coincided with the period of the last Tanaim and he often told of how in his early youth he attended the academy of the Nasi Rabbi Jehudah where he sat 17 rows behind Rav (Aba Arecha) and he listened to the debates between the two whose words flew like coals of fire, but which he could not understand because of his unripe age.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין קל״ז ב׳.</span></i>
Later Rabbi Jochanan was a pupil of Rabbi Jannai Raba,<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פּ״ח ב׳, בבא בתרא קנ״ד א׳.</span></i> but he also attended the lectures of Rabbi Chanina bar Chama,<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדה כ״ו ב׳, ירושלמי הוריות פרק ב׳ הלכה ח׳.</span></i> and when he began to lecture in the academy of Rabbi Banaa, Rabbi Chanina pronounced a benediction and praised God that he had been allowed to see the fruit of his labor.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי בבא מציעא פרק ב׳ הלכה י״א.</span></i> But even after he already ranked among the scholars, Rabbi Jochanan still heeded the words of older scholars and for a period of thirteen years he often attended the lectures of Rabbi Oshaiah in Caesarea.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ערובין פרק ה׳ הלכה א׳, סנהדרין פרק י״א הלכה ו׳.</span></i>
From the above we may conclude that Rabbi Jochanan was ready to learn from every one, but the foundation of his learning was the Mishna of the Nasi Rabbi Jehudah. The Mishna he considered as his highest authority and he often repeated that “I have nothing but the Mishna.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי תרומות פרק ב׳ הלכה ג׳, קדושין פרק א׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i> He considered every word of the Mishna to be holy and he believed that nothing could be added nor detracted from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי נזיר פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jochanan weighed and analyzed every word in the Mishna just as other scholars did to the text of the Torah. Statements of earlier scholars were sacred in his eyes and he said: “The hearts of earlier scholars were as wide as the gate of a palace”<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין נ״ג א׳.</span></i> and “The least finger nail of an earlier scholar was of greater worth than the whole body of the later ones.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא ט׳ ב׳.</span></i>
His belief in the words of earlier scholars was unshakable and every one of their statements was sacred in his eyes. He delved in antiquities and no other Amora strived as hard as he did to retain for later generations all the old traditions and what they signified. He therefore said: “Whatever is written in the Mishna has been commanded to Moses from Mount Sinai.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי פּאה פרק ב׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i>
Many customs of that time were considered by the other scholars to have been originated by the “Soferim” for various purposes and any man who broke one of these customs was merely said to have transgressed a Rabbinical commandment. But Rabbi Jochanan declared, that even such customs as those regulating the quantity of matter in questions pertaining to the prohibition of the use of certain articles<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא ה׳ א׳, ירושלמי פּאה פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> or the customs of beating willow branches and pouring water during the feast of Succoth were laws given to Moses on Mount Sinai.<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שביעית פרק א׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i> Likewise he declared that the Biblical prohibition against eating the fruit of trees which only began to bear, was mandatory also outside of Palestine as a Mosaic law.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ערלה פרק ג׳ הלבה ח׳.</span></i> It is also characteristic that he always spoke highly of the rabbinical commandments because of the fact that he considered all of these to partake of the same sacredness as the biblical commandments,<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים נ׳ ב׳.</span></i> and in this connection he said: “The words of the scholars are very near to the words of the Torah and often they are even more loved by the people than the words of the Torah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק א׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>
Aside from his great learning Rabbi Jochanan was also renowned for his moral qualities which were equalled only by few others. Because of his love for learning he despised wordly advantage and he preferred a life of suffering if only he would not be disturbed in the sacred work. From his father, or from his grandfather, he inherited a small field between Sephoris and Tiberias, and even this he sold in order to be free from mundane cares.
The death of his sons he suffered patiently and he found consolation in his studies. He was kind to all, even to his slave whom he gave meat to eat and wine to drink. When he was asked for the cause of such treatment of his slave he replied: “The slave was born in the same manner that I was born.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי בבא קמא פרק ח׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>
But although he led a pious life he believed that for the welfare of the community, or even for that of an individual, it was permissible to depart from the strict letter of the law. It was thus related that weak from hunger he once ate food without ascertaining whether it was clean. Another time he ruled that it was permissible to desecrate the Sabbath to save the life of a sick man who would later live to observe many Sabbaths.<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי יומא פרק ח׳ הלכה ח׳.</span></i> He also appeared indifferent to the habit of the people of painting various images on the walls of their houses under the influence of their Greek neighbors, although this was against the injunction of the Bible not to make any graven images.<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי עבודה זרה פרק ג׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
He was likewise tolerant in his interpretation of Biblical passages. Thus he explained that the injunction not to let “thy brother’s ox or his sheep go astray” (Deut. 22) applied even to the possessions of one who had renounced his Judaism.<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה כ״ו ב׳.</span></i> He also sought to modify the rule which forbade Jews to eat the flesh of an animal that was slaughtered by a Samaritan, if the slaughter was carried out in the presence of a Jew, who could testify that it had been performed according to law. It was then said that Rabbi Jochanan once ate of such flesh.<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין ה׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Due to the difficult political and economic circumstances of the country, many sought to emigrate and to settle in the neighboring lands. In an attempt to stem the tide of emigration, the Talmudic teachers declared that any scholar who left the country to settle in a foreign land was to be excluded from their society. Rabbi Jochanan, on the other hand, was opposed to this measure.<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי דמאי פרק ב׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
In addition to his tolerance Rabbi Jochanan also preached patience toward sinners. This was especially true in the case of the relations with the Romans. The Romans showed contempt for the Jews and the latter repaid them with the same measure. Since the Romans ridiculed Jewish wisdom and learning, the Jews underestimated the value of the Gentile sciences. It was then that Rabbi Jochanan declared that God had granted a share of wisdom to the Gentile nations and it was therefore possible for them to say wise things.<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה ט״ז א׳.</span></i>
He shared the reverence of the other Amoraim for the scholars and he often said that they were the “master builders” of the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">29-30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">29־30) שבת קי״ד א׳.</span></i> He expressed a similar sentiment when he said that “the Torah was like a fortress about the Jewish people and the scholars were its bastions.<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים פּ״ז א׳.</span></i> This was only true, he added, when a scholar served the Torah with all his might and renounced all worldly interests for the sake of spiritual interests,<sup class="footnote-marker">32)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי מועד קטן פרק ג׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i> when he ignored all earthly gain,<sup class="footnote-marker">33)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה ט״ו ב׳.</span></i> and when he did not desecrate the honor of the Torah by vain pride.<sup class="footnote-marker">34)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין נ״ה א׳.</span></i> Only one who possessed the above mentioned qualities could, in Rabbi Jochanan’s opinion, be considered a “master builder” of the world and a worthy guardian of the Torah. Such a man could be compared to a myrtle which grows in the desert.<sup class="footnote-marker">35)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה כ״ג א׳.</span></i>
And when Rabbi Jochanan thought that he had not sufficiently stressed the worth of the Torah, he added that even a bastard, who according to law could not be admitted into a Jewish family till the tenth generation, even he, if he is a scholar, is a more important one than an ignorant High Priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">36)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">הוריות י״ז א׳.</span></i>
The contemporaries of Rabbi Jochanan also gave preference to the rich, and of this attitude he said: “Not wealth nor noble descent are the measure of a man’s worth, but only his knowledge of the Torah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">37)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שבת פרק ב׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
Patiently he suffered misfortune and without complaint he bore his poverty, but he could not brook opposition to his opinions and he could easily become an enemy to one who opposed him in these. While he was still in Sephoris, he could not tolerate the Amora Rabbi Chanina bar Chama who disagreed with him. When he realized that he would never convince Rabbi Chanina of his own correctness, he left Sephoris and settled in Tiberias.<sup class="footnote-marker">38)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שביעית פרק ט׳ הלכה י״א.</span></i> Rabbi Jochanan also clashed with his pupil Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath who refrained from quoting his name when he repeated his opinions.<sup class="footnote-marker">39)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ב׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> Rabbi Jochanan then said: “Whatever Rabbi Elazar says he probably heard from me.”<sup class="footnote-marker">40)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי יבמות פרק ג׳ הלכה י׳.</span></i>
Once Rabbi Elazar repeated a law which he had heard from Rabbi Chanina concerning the share of a first born son in the inheritance of his father. Rabbi Jochanan then remarked: “It is strange that during all the years that I have sat at the feet of Rabbi Oshaia, I have not heard this law.” In saying this he meant to hint that Rabbi Elazar quoted Rabbi Oshaia in order to lend weight to an opinion which was his own. To this Rabbi Elazar replied: “Why is it strange? It is a common matter that one should hear something from his master which another has not heard.”<sup class="footnote-marker">41)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי יבמות פרק ג׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i>
But most characteristic of Rabbi Jochanan were his relations with his brother-in-law, Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish. Rabbi Simeon was a devoted friend of Rabbi Jochanan who often boasted that he introduced him into the mysteries of the Torah. Nevertheless he would tolerate no disagreement on his part and whenever Rabbi Simeon opposed him, Rabbi Jochanan complained that “even the members of my own family are against me.”<sup class="footnote-marker">42)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות נ״ד ב׳.</span></i>
However, these shortcomings of Rabbi Jochanan were overlooked by the people who only saw his great achievements toward increasing the worth and the influence of the Torah and his own importance grew in their eyes as a result of his efforts. Rabbi Oshaia, who was probably the head of the academy of Tiberias, meanwhile died and Rabbi Jochanan succeeded to this office. Hosts of disciples then flocked to him and his name became known throughout the land, even to Babylonia.
Rabbi Jochanan showed great reverence for the scholars of Babylonia and he was angered when he heard them slighted. His words were also held in great respect in that country and it was sufficient for him to inform them what the law was and his opinion was accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">43)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קט״ו א׳.</span></i> Rabbi Chisda was the only one in Babylonia who dared to disagree with Rabbi Jochanan and he declared that even if he were to receive instructions from Rabbi Jochanan he would disobey them.<sup class="footnote-marker">44)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות כ״ד ב׳.</span></i> On another occasion, while disputing with a disciple of Rabbi Jochanan, he similarly remarked: “Who heeds you or your master Rabbi Jochanan.”<sup class="footnote-marker">45)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים ל״ג ב׳, נדרים נ״ט א׳.</span></i>
Rav (Aba Arecha) and Shmuel (Yarchinai) were at that time the heads of the academies in Babylonia. When Rabbi Jochanan addressed messages to that country, he always wrote to Rav whom he called “our teacher in Babylonia,” but after the death of Rav he refused to recognize Shmuel as an authority in legal matters, and in his letters to him, he addressed him as “our friend in Babylonia.” Shmuel was offended by this attitude and as proof of his authority in Halacha he sent to Rabbi Jochanan a calculation of the seasons and a calendar of leap years for sixty years. But Rabbi Jochanan said that one may be an expert in reckoning the seasons and yet not be an authority in Halacha. Shmuel then sent him “thirteen camels” (?) laden with questions pertaining to the laws of cleanliness and only then did Rabbi Jochanan exclaim: “There is a teacher in Babylonia.”<sup class="footnote-marker">46)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין צ״ה ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jochanan found a staunch adherent in Rabbi Jehudah N’sia I, the grandson of Rabbi Jehudah. He realized that the needs of his office as well as his personal benefit required such an attitude, and knowing of Rabbi Jochanan’s sensitive nature in everything that touched his personal honor, the Nasi refrained from offending him in any manner. The Nasi also supported Rabbi Jochanan with the authority of his office and he provided for all his needs.<sup class="footnote-marker">47)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה כ״א א׳.</span></i> The power of the Nasi was then still great enough to enable him to enforce his regulations with the aid of the government. This power greatly aided Rabbi Jochanan to put his religious regulations into effect.
Rabbi Jochanan particularly strived to impress upon the people the significance of prayers which had been introduced some time before, but which apparently were neglected. Everybody realized that since the destruction of the temple prayers came to take the place of sacrifices. It therefore became necessary that a man of the authority of Rabbi Jochanan should establish the proper significance of prayers.
Rabbi Jochanan then declared that “he who wears phylacteries, pronounces the Shema and recites his prayers, is like one who has built an altar and has offered a sacrifice.”<sup class="footnote-marker">48)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ט״ו א׳.</span></i> He also ruled that every man should pray in a place specially appointed for this purpose,<sup class="footnote-marker">49)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ה׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> for “whoever establishes a special place where he recites his prayers, his enemies shall fall before his feet, and when a congregation prays together then it is a time when God is ready to fulfill the wishes of the supplicants.”<sup class="footnote-marker">50)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ה׳ א׳.</span></i> When a man is told to be the messenger of the congregation, he is not told: “Go and pray for us!”, but rather should he be told: “Go and offer a sacrifice for us, pray for our needs and fight our battles!”<sup class="footnote-marker">51)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ד׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>
We have mentioned above that Rabbi Jochanan was a pupil of Rabbi Jehudah in his early youth. In his later years he paid tribute to his master by saying that he would never have reached his position as a scholar if he “had not seen Rabbi Jehudah’s finger portruding from under his mantle.”<sup class="footnote-marker">52)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ביצה פרק ה׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>
Regarding Rabbi Johanan’s birth there exists a legend that on a Day of Atonement a pregnant woman was seized with a great craving for food. Rabbi Jehudah was consulted and he suggested that the woman be reminded that it was the Day of Atonement. When this was done, her craving for food vanished and she completed her fast. This woman was said to be the mother of Rabbi Jochanan.<sup class="footnote-marker">53)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא פּ״ב ב׳.</span></i><sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">In the Jerusalem Talmud (Yoma, 8:4) this story is related as concerning two women, one of whom completed her fast while the other remained unaffected by the reminder; it is there said to have occurred during the time of Rabbi Tarphon.</i>
Rabbi Jochanan was raised in the house of his grandfather and partly in the home of the Nasi who prophesied that he would some day be a teacher among Jews.<sup class="footnote-marker">54)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים ג׳ ב׳.</span></i> He survived all his comrades and even the grandson of Rabbi Jehudah. Since he lived till the fourth generation of Amoraim, he witnessed the decline of the Nasi and the loss of his prestige.
It is told that whenever Rabbi Jochanan was immersed in his studies, he was not aware of what transpired about him. Thus he once sat before the synagogue in Sephoris engaged in his studies. A high Roman official happened to pass by, but Rabbi Jochanan did not notice him and did not accord him his due honors. The servants of the official were ready to attack Rabbi Jochanan, but the Roman prevented them from doing so, for he understood that it was not out of lack of respect that the honor was denied to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">55)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ה׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jochanan was a strong and stout man.<sup class="footnote-marker">56)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות י״ג ב׳.</span></i> As he was once ascending some stairs, supported by Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi, the stairs caved in under his weight and his two disciples carried him up in their arms. The scholars then asked him: “If you are so strong, why do you lean on others?”, but Rabbi Jochanan replied: “I must spare my strength for my old age.”<sup class="footnote-marker">57)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ס״ב א׳.</span></i>
But above all Rabbi Jochanan was gifted with great beauty.<sup class="footnote-marker">58)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות כ׳ א׳.</span></i> It was also remarkable that he was beardless and as he was once bathing in the river a passerby mistook him for a woman and waded after him into the water.<sup class="footnote-marker">59)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פּ״ד א׳.</span></i> The Talmud further relates that Rabbi Jochanan himself declared: “I am the only one remaining of the beautiful men of Jerusalem,” and when people spoke of his beauty, they said: “If one would have some conception of the beauty of Rabbi Jochanan, he must take a silver beaker just out from the hands of the silversmith and fill it with red flowers, then he should surround it with a wreath of red roses and place it between the sun and the shade; the reflection of the beaker on the ground will then resemble the beauty of Rabbi Jochanan.”
His diligence in his studies so weakened Rabbi Jochanan that he could not wear the phylacteries all day. During the winter he wore the phylacteries on arm and head, but during the summer, when his head felt weak, he merely wore the phylacteries of the arm. But in order that others should not copy his example, he explained to his disciples that it was only due to his weakness that he took these liberties.<sup class="footnote-marker">59a)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">59א) ירושלמי ברכות פרק ב׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
Of all the books of the Bible R. Jochanan preferred the book of Job and after each reading he exclaimed: “Death is the end of man; slaughter is the end of animals; all that exists is doomed to die. Happy is he who was raised in the Torah and who devoted his efforts to it. Such a person brings joy to his Creator when his good name grows and when he leaves the world with a fair name.”<sup class="footnote-marker">60)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות י״ז א׳.</span></i>
We have already noted Rabbi Jochanan’s attitude toward prayer and his insistence that people should pray in congregations. To this he added that when God comes into a synagogue and does not find there a quorum of Jews (a “minyan” of ten) He is angered thereby.<sup class="footnote-marker">61)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ו׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Every time that Rabbi Jochanan finished his prayers, he concluded with the following words: “May it be Thy will, oh Lord our God, that You should see our shame and observe our plight and that You should don Your great mercy and cover Yourself with Your strength and wrap Yourself with Your righteousness and gird Yourself with Your forgiveness and may the measure of Your goodness and Your modesty come before You.”<sup class="footnote-marker">62)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ט״ז ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jochanan is also said to have shown respect to every person and whenever he saw an old man he rose before him even if the man was of another faith, he would then say: “So much suffering the man withstood and if in spite of all he lived to old age he deserves that honor be accorded to him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">63)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ל״ג א׳.</span></i>
But his attitude toward the scholars of Babylonia was contradictory. The political and economic situation of Palestine then resulted in the establishment of a Jewish center in Babylonia. The might of the Romans broke at the gates of Babylonia and the Jews enjoyed numerous liberties in that country. When young men came from Babylonia to study in the academy of Rabbi Jochanan, he befriended them, but nevertheless he sometimes allowed himself to make fun of them. When asked why he did so, Rabbi Jochanan replied: “The prophet Hosea allowed himself to mock the Jews of the foreign lands when he said that they are despised in the eyes of God who exiled them to foreign lands for their disobedience. Then why should I not allow myself the same?”<sup class="footnote-marker">64)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שיר השירים רבה פּרשה ה׳ פּיסקא א׳.</span></i>
But Rabbi Jochanan’s mockery was good natured in character. This, for instance, was the case when he was explaining some passages to one of his pupils, but he realized that the latter did not understand what he was told. He then asked him: “What is the cause of your lack of understanding of that which I tell you?” The pupil replied: “It is because I am exiled from my home.” “And where is your home?” Rabbi Jochanan further asked.
“In Bursif,” the pupil replied.
“Oh, in Bulsif!” Rabbi Jochanan mocked his pronounciation, for the Babylonians pronounced the letter r with difficulty.
Another time he remarked to his pupil Rabbi Chiya bar Aba: “How could you become interested in learning in Babylonia, where you were always busy eating dates?”<sup class="footnote-marker">65)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא ק״ז ב׳.</span></i>
On the same subject he also said: “Even if all the Jews had returned from Babylonia together with Ezra, the Shechinah would still not have rested on the second temple, for the Babylonian Jews suffered from the Biblical curse that God would give them a heart full of unrest which would not calm even with their coming to Palestine.”<sup class="footnote-marker">66)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדרים כ״ב א׳, שיר השירים רבה פּרשה ח׳ פּיסקא י׳.</span></i>
But Rabbi Jochanan also had kind words to say of Babylonia. Thus he explained the name Babylonia to mean “varied” or “confused” and he pointed out that the Jews of Babylonia engaged in the study of all branches of the Torah such as Scriptures, Mishna and Gemara.<sup class="footnote-marker">67)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קמ״ה ב׳.</span></i>
Ofttimes he would also say: “Why did God choose to exile the Jews to Babylonia? This may be compared to a man who is angered with his wife and sends her away from his house; he then sends her to her mother’s house. God did likewise with the Jews; He exiled them to the land whence their mothers came.”<sup class="footnote-marker">68)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים פּ״ז ב׳.</span></i>
The political situation of that time is mirrored in the sayings of Rabbi Jochanan. Whenever the scholars wanted to discuss this problem they generally did so by speaking of the times of the coming of Messiah. When we analyze their discources we can obtain a clear picture of the events of that time. These discourses also served to revive the courage of the people in the face of their misfortunes which were explained to be the “pains of Messiah” preceding the redemption. We thus possess hundreds of statements by Rabbi Jochanan from which we may learn of the conditions of his time and also his philosophy of life which is of worth for all times.
“In the generation that will mark the coming of Messiah,” Rabbi Jochanan said, “scholars will diminish and all men will sigh with sorrow. There will be many misfortunes and numerous evil decrees will be promulgated daily; before one decree will be enforced, another one will be enacted.”<sup class="footnote-marker">69)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין צ״ז א׳.</span></i>
When Rabbi Jochanan was telling the story of Jacob who was waiting for Esau and who meanwhile prayed to God: “Spare me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau,” he remarked: “Such is the way of an evil kingdom when it desires to seize the property of men; it appoints one to be an overseer and another to be tax collector. All this is done in order to take away from the people that which they possess.”<sup class="footnote-marker">70)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ע״ו פּיסקא ח׳.</span></i>
It is also related that Rabbi Jochanan never smiled and that he was always sorrowing. He declared: “One must never laugh as long as the Jews are in exile and the promise that the Gentile nations will see the miracles that have been performed for the Jews has not yet been fulfilled.”<sup class="footnote-marker">71)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ל״א א׳.</span></i>
We have already written concerning his reverence for the Torah. In this category belong his statements that “the Torah clings to that person who in his modesty acts as if he did not exist at all,”<sup class="footnote-marker">72)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה כ״א ב׳.</span></i> and “if one has learned much but does not observe the commandments, it would have been better had he not been born.”<sup class="footnote-marker">73)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שמות רבה פּרשה מ׳ פּיסקא א׳.</span></i>
“Out of reverence for the Torah,” he said, “it is a shame for a scholar to go about in patched shoes and it is a sin punishable by death for a scholar to go about in a spotted garment.”<sup class="footnote-marker">74)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ד א׳.</span></i>
The praise which he expressed for prayer in congregations, he somewhat modified in his old age when due to weakness he often wore only the phylacteries of the arm and he said: “Whoever prays at home is like one who has surrounded his prayer with an iron wall.”<sup class="footnote-marker">75)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ה׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jochanan had ten sons and all of them died during his lifetime. In order to console him one of the scholars said that he who buries his sons during his lifetime, God will forgive his sins. But Rabbi Jochanan denied this and said that “sickness and the death of children are not a punishment which God visits upon a person out of love,<sup class="footnote-marker">76)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ה׳ ב׳.</span></i> but rather is it true that “he who leaves no sons to inherit him, has incurred God’s anger.”<sup class="footnote-marker">77)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא קט״ז א׳.</span></i> He believed instead that exile, rightlessness, the hardships of wandering and restlessness are conditions that forgive man’s sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">78)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ל״ז ב׳.</span></i>
Various authorities of his time forbade the writing down of the Talmudic legends, but Rabbi Jochanan declared that one who studies the legends out of a book will not forget it so readily.<sup class="footnote-marker">79)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ה׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> Another time he came out against writing down the “Halacha” (the law) and said that “whoever writes down the laws is like one who has burned the Torah and he who studies law from a book will receive no reward.”<sup class="footnote-marker">80)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תמורה י״ד ב׳.</span></i>
During the numerous clashes between the Romans and the Parthians who ruled in Babylonia, Rabbi Jochanan always hoped for the victory of the Parthians and he often repeated the statement that was credited to Rabbi Jehudah that the Romans would in the end be vanquished by the Parthians.<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">We have already remarked that the Talmud often confused the name of the Parthians who originated in the lands about the Euphrates with the Persians who ruled Babylonia at a later date.</i>
This statement he further amplified by reasoning as follows: “If the first temple that was built by Jews and was destroyed by the Chaldeans, caused the Chaldeans to be conquered by the Persians; the second temple that was built by Persians and destroyed by Romans, would certainly cause the Romans to be conquered by the Persians.”
Rav (Aba Arecha), on the other hand, looked forward to a victory of the Romans. But the hopes of neither came to pass, for the Persian “Chabarim” (Zoroastrians) meanwhile took over the government of Babylonia. When Rabbi Jochanan heard of this he felt disappointed in all his hopes.<sup class="footnote-marker">81)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ס״ג ב׳.</span></i>
A period of turbulence and upheaval at that time affected all the countries wherein Jews lived. After the death of Alexander Severus, Rome underwent a period of unrest and emperors changed rapidly. In Babylonia a prince of the house of Sassan, named Ardeshir (or Artachshaster) revolted against Artaban, the last of the Parthian dynasty. The struggle in Babylonia was more of a religious nature. Artaban was favorably inclined to the Greek form of worship which penetrated the country and the population revolted against the innovation. The rebel Artachshaster therefore easily overcame the ruling king and established a new dynasty in place of the old one which had ruled the country for 466 years.
The new rulers of Babylonia, historically known as the Sassanides, are referred to in Jewish writings as “Chabarim.” These were worshippers of fire and they believed in a dual deity of light and darkness. Zealously they persecuted all those who refused their teachings and they were especially vengeful toward the Greeks and Christians. The Jews also met with suffering but they were not persecuted with such fury as were the Greeks and Christians. The latter were offered a choice between acceptance of the law of Zoroaster or emigration. Those who stubbornly clung to their beliefs were executed.
Jews were deprived of the right to judge in cases affecting life and as long as they remained neutral to the dominant religion they were tolerated in a measure. This attitude was not a result of kindness but was rather due to the fact that the Jews offered a great resistance to the “Chabarim.” Since they lived in Babylonia in compact masses it was difficult to subdue them.
The affliction of the Jews under the rule of the “Chabarim” could nevertheless easily compare with their plight under the Romans. They remained undisturbed in their religious life only so long as they did not use fire for any purpose. When they lit candles on the eve of Sabbath or on Chanukah these had to be hidden and any person that was caught keeping fire in his house was condemned to death.
The Jews of Palestine then felt that their plight was incomparable and the Jews of Babylonia were convinced that the conditions in Palestine were more favorable. When the news of these developments reached Palestine, the Jews of that country began to say that the Romans were honorable men even in their oppression while the “Chabarim” were no more than barbarians.
When Rabbi Jochanan became convinced that no help could come from Babylonia he began to look forward to aid from Tiberias which was the last home of the Sanhedrin.<sup class="footnote-marker">82)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה ל״א ב׳.</span></i> In order to encourage the people and to persuade them to remain in the country he declared that God said: “I cannot enter the heavenly Jerusalem until I have come to Jerusalem on earth,”<sup class="footnote-marker">83)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית ה׳ א׳.</span></i> or “he who walks four ells in Palestine is certain of his share in life to come.”<sup class="footnote-marker">84)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות קי״א א׳.</span></i>
Another time he said: “What good deeds had Omri, king of Israel, done that he merited the crown? It was because he added a city, Samaria, to the kingdom of Israel.”<sup class="footnote-marker">85)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ק״ב ב׳.</span></i>
Of the old age of Rabbi Jochanan it is told that for a period of three and a half years he did not come to the academy out of grief for his brother-in-law who had died.<sup class="footnote-marker">86)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי מגלה פרק א׳ הלכה י׳.</span></i> When he realized that his death was approaching he instructed those that were to bury him that he be interred in a shroud which was neither black nor white. For if he be buried in a black shroud he may, at the resurrection, come to life among just men and he would be put to shame. Likewise if he be buried in a white shroud, he may come to life among wicked men and he would be shamed by his garment of a just man.<sup class="footnote-marker">87)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי כלאים פרק ט׳ הלכה ג׳, בראשית רבה פּרשה צ״ו פּיסקא ט׳.</span></i>
According to tradition Rabbi Jochanan lived to a ripe old age. The “Chronicle” of Rav Sherira Gaon declares that he survived Rabbi Jehudah HaNasi by 68 years and that he died in the year 279. (C.E.)
Aside from the statements of Rabbi Jochanan that we have quoted so far in connection with various moments of his life there also exist many expressions of his that are concerned with the interpretation of passages of the Bible. Although most of these are of value only in exposition, some of them contain important philosophic observations concerning the conduct of men and the ways of the world.
At a certain period of Rabbi Jochanan’s life it was forbidden to the Jews to determine the month through lunar observation and the Romans were especially strict in preventing them from celebrating their holidays. At the same time the observance of the Sabbath was not interfered with. Under the influence of Rabbi Jochanan the court in Tiberias therefore decided to observe the Day of Atonement on a Sabbath, although it really occurred on a week day, in order to deceive the Romans. The exact date of this occurrence is unknown as is also the duration of this decree. We can only guess under what administration this took place, for we only find hints about this event.<sup class="footnote-marker">88)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין קנ״ה ב׳.</span></i> Historians are therefore confused as to the exact date and also as to the motive which prompted Rabbi Jochanan to instruct even the Jews of Babylonia to observe the Day of Atonement on a Sabbath, although the latter were not under the rule of the Romans and could have celebrated the Day of Atonement in its proper time. We find an explanation of this hinted in the statement of Rabbi Jochanan who said that the angels gather about God and ask him: “When is the New Year and when is the Day of Atonement?” and God answers them: “Why do you ask me? Let us go to the Court on earth and we will find out.”<sup class="footnote-marker">89)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ראש השנה פרק א׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i> By this statement he meant to imply that the court in Tiberias had the complete right to determine holidays as it saw fit under the circumstances.
The following is a similar statement concerning the determination of holidays: If the court had said that today is New Year then God says to the angels: “Erect a platform and let the prosecutor and the defense appear before me, for my children have said that today is New Year and so it shall be.” If the Court decided to postpone the New Year till the following day, then God says to the angels: “Take this platform away and remove the prosecutor and the defense for my children have postponed the New Year till the following day and so it shall be.”
Rabbi Jochanan was always poor even when he headed the academy and when he received assistance from the Nasi. He then said: “When one depends on the charity of men, the color of his face changes to pale and blue.” In general we may assume that it was very difficult to earn a livelihood at that time from his statement that “It is difficult to earn a livelihood, twice as difficult as the pains of a woman in childbirth, more difficult than the arrival of the redemption.”<sup class="footnote-marker">90)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים קי״ח א׳.</span></i>
It appears that it was customary at that time for the people of a city to do the work of the scholars that resided there. When Rabbi Jochanan was asked how great a scholar one must be, to deserve such a service from his townsmen, he replied: “Only a scholar who renounces all worldly occupations and devotes himself solely to heavenly matters deserves this service; but the obligation rests on the people only to provide him with his daily bread but not with luxuries.”<sup class="footnote-marker">91)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ד א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jochanan therefore added: “One should eat an onion and sit in the shade and not eat geese and hens that his heart should not lust after such food.”<sup class="footnote-marker">92)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים קי״ד א׳.</span></i>
There are grounds to assume that he also believed in hypnotism and in the ability of a person to convince himself that he was in a healthy or a sickly state. Thus it is told that when Rabbi Chama bar Aba fell sick Rabbi Jochanan came to visit him and asked him: “Do you accept your suffering with love?”, by which he meant that suffering atones for the sins of man who enters the world to come purified of wrong doing. But the sick man replied: “I do not want the suffering nor its reward.” “Then give me your hand,” Rabbi Jochanan said. Rabbi Chama gave him his hand and he was healed.
Another version of this story relates that Rabbi Jochanan came to visit Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath who fell sick and he found him lying in a dark room. Rabbi Jochanan then bared his arm which illuminated the room and he saw that Rabbi Elazar was weeping. “What is the cause of your weeping?” he asked. “Is it because you have not studied as much as you had wanted to? We have a rule that it is all the same whether one studies much or little and that only the good intention counts. Do you weep because you cannot earn your livelihood? One cannot deserve two tables, the table of the Torah and the table of worldly goods. Do you weep that you leave no son? Then look at me that I carry a bone of my tenth son.”
To this Rabbi Elazar replied: “I weep because I am reminded that beauty such as yours will rot in the ground.” “For this one should weep,” Rabbi Jochanan responded, and they both wept.<sup class="footnote-marker">93)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ה׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Still another form of this story is told concerning Rabbi Jochanan and Rabbi Chanina.<sup class="footnote-marker">94)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שיר השירים פּרשה ב׳ פּיסקא ל״ה.</span></i>
Rabbi Jochanan was punished by becoming afflicted with a disease for three and a half years. Rabbi Chanina came to visit him and said: “What do you ail from?”, to which the other replied: “It is more than I can bear.” “You must not say so,” Rabbi Chanina answered, “you should rather say that God is just.” It is further related that when Rabbi Jochanan’s pains increased, Rabbi Chanina pronounced an incantation and the pain ceased. We may conclude from this Midrash that Rabbi Jochanan believed in incantations.
It must be remarked, however, that this matter is not entirely clear, for Rabbi Akiba had already declared that “one who attempts to heal a wound with incantations loses his share in the life to come.”<sup class="footnote-marker">95)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ק״א א׳, שבועות מ״ז ב׳.</span></i>
When people wondered that a man like Rabbi Jochanan, who lived in poverty and who devoted all his energies to study, nevertheless retained good health, he said: “My father comes from a healthy family and I can do without meat, but under present conditions it is best that any man who has money should immediately spend it and buy meat.”<sup class="footnote-marker">96)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין פּ״ד א׳.</span></i>
We may add the following statements of Rabbi Jochanan to illustrate his great love for the Torah:
One who has many pupils but does not allow them to serve him is as if he had denied them his kindness,<sup class="footnote-marker">97)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות צ״ו א׳.</span></i> for serving the Torah is often more important than study itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">98)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ז׳ ב׳.</span></i>
When Jews devote themselves to the Torah and to charity, their evil natures are under their control and not they under control of their evil natures.<sup class="footnote-marker">99)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה ח׳ א׳.</span></i> Study is of such importance that one who engages in it in this world is conducted into the academies of Shem and Eber, of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, of Moses and of Aaron, in the world to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">100)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">100) שיר השירים רבה פּרשה ו׳ פּיסקא ח׳.</span></i>
Three types of people are so rare that when they occur God speaks of them and He also wishes that people should note their qualities. The first is an unmarried man who lives in a great city and does not sin; the second is a poor man who returns what he finds to its owner; the third is a rich man who offers the tithes of his fruit so that no one should know of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">101)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">101) פּסחים קי״ג א׳.</span></i>
There are three types of attractions: One is the attraction of a place in the eyes of its inhabitants; another is the attraction of a woman in the eyes of her husband; the third is the attraction of something bought in the eyes of its buyer.<sup class="footnote-marker">102)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">102) סוטה מ״ז א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jochanan attached great importance to repentance and he said that “whoever believes that king Menasseh, the son of Hezekiah, has no share in the world to come, weakens the hands of penitents by making them believe that repentance is of no avail.”<sup class="footnote-marker">103)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">103) סנהדרין ק״ג א׳.</span></i>
The following are among the other interesting statements of Rabbi Jochanan:
Great is the day when God will gather the exiled Jews—as great as the day on which He created heaven and earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">104)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">104) פּסחים פּ״ח א׳.</span></i>
Deception with words is even worse than deception in money matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">105)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">105) בבא מציעא נ״ח א׳.</span></i>
The prophets spoke only for those who give their daughter in marriage to a scholar, or who conduct the business of a scholar or who share their wealth with scholars.<sup class="footnote-marker">106)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">106) סנהדרין ק״ג א׳.</span></i>
The observance of six types of commandments rewards men in this world while the principal of the good deed is rewarded in the world to come. These commandments are: hospitality to strangers, visiting the sick, careful prayer, rising early to go to the academy, raising children to the knowledge of the Torah and judging everyone according to his good deeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">107)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">107) שבת קכ״ז א׳.</span></i>
When Rabbi Jochanan died, Rabbi Yitzchak ben Elazar eulogized him in the following words: “This day is as difficult for the Jews as if the sun had suddenly set at midday.”<sup class="footnote-marker">108)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">108) מועד קטן כ״ה ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jochanan was called the “Editor of the Jerusalem Talmud.” This does not imply that he gathered and edited all the statements and opinions which we find in it, but rather that he conceived the idea that since Jewish life expanded to such a great extent, the Mishna was no longer sufficient and that it was necessary to gather everything which the scholars said in comment on the Mishna. This became the foundation for the Jerusalem Talmud.

Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish

T<small>HE ACADEMY OF</small> R<small>ABBI</small> J<small>OCHANAN</small> was open for all those who sought learning. Men of two generations prided themselves on being disciples of Rabbi Jochanan. Among these there were some who saw and heard Rabbi Jehudah ha-Nasi, but themselves remained disciples while he grew in stature to become one of the most outstanding Amoraim. Among his disciples there were also some who themselves headed academies, but who came to the academy of Rabbi Jochanan in Tiberias as often as they could in order to be able to call themselves his disciples although their circumstances did not compel them to do so.
Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish was one of the most prominent of these colleagues and disciples of Rabbi Jochanan. In the Talmud he is more commonly referred to as Resh Lakish.<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">Resh Lakish is an abbreviation of Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish (<span dir="rtl">ר״ש</span>). The mark indicating the abbreviation was in time transformed into a Yud. We may also remark that his appelation Ben Lakish does not prove that Lakish was the name of his father, but might indicate that he was a native of a city called Lakish, possibly the biblical “Lachish.” One of the last Tanaim was also called Rabbi Jehudah ben Lakish, and in this case also the appelation may indicate the city of origin rather than the name of the father.</i>
Very little is known definitely of the youth of Resh Lakish and numerous terrifying legends surround his early years. It was said that he befriended robbers and that he was a robber himself. While going about the banks of the Jordan armed from head to foot, he saw a woman bathing and he entered the water. But the figure which he saw bathing was not a woman. Instead it was Rabbi Jochanan who remarked to him that such unusual strength as he seemed to possess should rightfully be devoted to the Torah. Resh Lakish replied: “Such beauty as you possess, should belong to a woman.” Rabbi Jochanan is said to have told him: “If you will turn to learning, I will give you my sister, who is more beautiful than I am, for a wife.” Resh Lakish then promised to give up his occupation and to turn to learning and he married the sister of Rabbi Jochanan.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פּ״ד א׳.</span></i>
The legend is highly questionable and does not agree with other accounts of the youth of Resh Lakish. Thus it was accepted as a fact that in his youth he was a companion of Rabbi Jochanan in the academy of Rabbi Jehudah which would make any such error as the legend ascribes to him out of the question. Nor is there any mention anywhere as to who the teacher of Resh Lakish had been, for although he attended the academy of Rabbi Jehudah together with Rabbi Jochanan, they were both very young at that time and could not have been direct pupils of Rabbi Jehudah, although in later life they both declared that were it not for their contact with Rabbi Jehudah, they would not have attained their status as scholars.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ביצה פרק ה׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>
It appears that both, Resh Lakish and Rabbi Jochanan, attained prominence rapidly, but Resh Lakish continued to be considered a disciple of the latter despite the fact that his importance was great enough, so that problems were brought to him for decision in the absence of Rabbi Ephes who was a disciple and a member of the household of the Nasi.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין ס״ה ב׳.</span></i> In scholarship, however, the two were considered to be of the same rank by the Nasi and by Rabbi Hoshaia Raba.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות נ״ז א׳.</span></i>
In the academy of Rabbi Chanina bar Chama it was customary for Rabbi Chanina to begin a lecture and for Resh Lakish and Rabbi Jochanan to finish it.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי סנהדרין פרק א׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i> Resh Lakish was also held in great esteem at the court of Rabbi Hoshaia Raba,<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי יבמות פרק ט״ז הלכה ה׳.</span></i> and he called Rabbi Hoshaia “the father of the Mishna.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי בבא קמא פרק ד׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i> Resh Lakish was also a friend of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi, whom he quoted on numerous occasions. All this would indicate that Resh Lakish and Rabbi Jochanan were friends since youth. They were both considered as equals and were referred to as “the two great men of the world.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ח׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i>
Some scholars considered Resh Lakish to be superior to Rabbi Jochanan in the use of clear logic. Ula, one of his pupils, declared: “He who sees Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish expounding in the academy, will imagine that he sees a man uprooting mountains and crushing them one against another.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין כ״ד א׳.</span></i> Rabbi Jochanan likewise said: “Whenever Resh Lakish is absent from the academy I feel as if I lacked my right hand.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי סנהדרין פרק ב׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> Resh Lakish was not an ordinary disciple who assents to all that is said. On the contrary, he frequently raised doubts concerning opinions that were expressed and Rabbi Jochanan complained that Resh Lakish would ask 24 (!) questions in every matter and that he had to search for replies to all these questions.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פּ״ד א׳.</span></i> It is also remarkable that the questions of Resh Lakish were often of such penetrating keenness that Rabbi Jochanan was compelled to change his previous opinion,<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי יומא פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> and in at least one instance, when the question of “Eruvin” was being discussed, the opinion of Resh Lakish prevailed.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ערובין פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
Resh Lakish based all of his opinions on the Mishna and he rarely employed arguments which were not substantiated by the Mishna.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי גטין פרק ג׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish was known for his honesty in worldly matters, and any person with whom he had dealings was considered to be as honest as himself and to be trusted unquestioningly.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא ט׳ ב׳.</span></i> In his loyalty to his friends he was ready for self-sacrifice and it was told that when Rabbi Isi was captured by bandits, Resh Lakish hastened to save him, saying that he must do so even if his own life were endangered.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי תרומות סוף פרק ח׳.</span></i> His diligence was incomparable and he was said to study every subject forty times.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית ה׳ א׳.</span></i> He boasted himself that even Rabbi Chiya bar Aba was not more diligent than he was.<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי כתובות פרק י״ב הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
But despite all these qualities he never attained the headship of an academy and he always remained a disciple of Rabbi Jochanan. When differences of opinion occurred the matter was always decided according to Rabbi Jochanan with the exception of three cases concerning “Halitza” which the Babylonian scholars decided according to Resh Lakish, but this was due to the fact that there was no dissenting opinion from Rabbi Jochanan.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ל״ז א׳.</span></i>
Resh Lakish was not a reserved man, and when it seemed to him that not enough attention was paid to his words, he would shout in a loud voice.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין מ״ד א׳.</span></i> He also did not restrain himself from passing judgment when he saw wrong and he did not spare his colleagues, nor even the Nasi, in this respect.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ט׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Sometimes it happened that Rabbi Jochanan expressed an opinion in a matter of law and Rabbi Janai Raba praised him for it; Resh Lakish then ironically remarked that Rabbi Jochanan’s words were incorrect.<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי סוטה פרק ב׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i>
Much time and energy was devoted by the scholars in gathering the “Baraithoth” (the tannait traditions not incorporated in the Mishna), and it was even attempted to lend to these the authority of law. Resh Lakish opposed this tendency and refused to recognize the authorship of those “Baraithoth.” He therefore ruled that every Mishna which had not been studied by a group of scholars should not be depended upon.<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ערובין פרק א׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i> In this respect he would not even listen to Rabbi Jochanan and he refused to accept any new “Baraitha,” saying that it was not needed and that Rabbi Jehudah had left a complete Mishna.<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי כלאים פרק א׳ הלכה ו׳, בבא קמא פרק ה׳ הלכה ח׳.</span></i>
Because of these habits, Resh Lakish was disliked by his contemporaries who looked upon him as a trouble maker.<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין כ״ז א׳.</span></i> Thus he was the first to declare that the events related in the book of Job were imaginary, that there never was a man named Job nor ever will be, and that the whole book was but intended to teach people moral principles.<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי סוטה פרק ה׳ הלכה ו׳, בראשית רבה פּרשה נ״ו פּיסקא ג׳.</span></i><sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">The above mentioned passage from the Talmud Jerushalmi attempts to explain a contradiction for Resh Lakish is first quoted as saying that Job lived during the days of Abraham and later he declared that there was no Job. The Talmud explains this contradiction by saying that Resh Lakish did believe in the existence of Job, but he did not believe that Job, who was a just man, would have sinned because of his suffering.</i>
Another time he declared that the Jews borrowed the names of the angels from the Babylonians because until the time of the Prophets who lived in Babylonia the Bible spoke of angels without mentioning names.<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ראש השנה פרק א׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>
The reason why Resh Lakish never came to head an academy either in Tiberias or in any other city despite the fact that he was considered worthy for such a post is explained by the fact of his past, when he interrupted his scholarly career and followed ways not befitting a scholar. Like Rabbi Jochanan who left the academy for a short time to engage in commerce Resh Lakish also abandoned his studies for a time but not to engage in commerce. Instead he became a gladiator.<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ט ב׳, גטין מ״ז א׳.</span></i><sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">The Talmud says that “he sold himself to the Luddites” and some commentators said that the “Luddites” were a people of cannibals. Actually it implied a group of people who trained man-eating animals.</i>
Another time Resh Lakish hired out as a garden watchman. Because of his unusual strength and his ability to deal with animals, he was trusted to be able to drive away any marauders. But it is further told that thieves once came to that garden and took as much fruit as they could carry and Resh Lakish did not seize them and bring them to court; instead he argued with them and threatened them with excommunication.<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן מ״ז א׳, ירושלמי מועד קטן פרק ג׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
Once Rabbi Jochanan was robbed of all his possessions and when Resh Lakish came to the academy and asked him something, he did not reply. Resh Lakish inquired for the cause of his silence and the latter replied: “My heart is with the wealth that the robbers have taken away from me.” Resh Lakish then pursued the robbers and retrieved the stolen wealth.
Because of these stories there were rumors that Resh Lakish associated with robbers. The truth of the matter was that because of his poverty, for he had no income from his scholastic endeavors, he sometimes hired out as a gladiator and at other times as a watchman, but he is not known to have done any harm and even the robbers against whom he was supposed to protect he merely threatened with excommunication and not with that punishment which they deserved. Rabbi Jochanan brought Resh Lakish back to the Torah, as we have previously related, but even after he abandoned his earlier calling, the people continued to remember it. When Rabbi Jochanan was called upon to answer a question pertaining to knives and how they are contaminated, Resh Lakish found the correct answer and Rabbi Jochanan remarked: “A robber understands in matters of his trade.” He said this although Resh Lakish was then already his brother-in-law and was held to be his equal in learning.
Like Rabbi Jochanan Resh Lakish also disliked the Babylonians who prided themselves on the fact that, when the Jews returned from Babylonia to Palestine, only the poorer families left while the more aristocratic remained behind. To this Resh Lakish remarked: “If someone told me that there are genealogies of the families in Babylonia I would go and bring them, but even if all the scholars gathered for this purpose they could not bring them thence.”<sup class="footnote-marker">30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי סנהדרין פרק י׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
On another occasion he chided the Babylonian Jews for remaining in an unclean land and not returning to Palestine with Ezra. Speaking with Raba bar Bar Chana he said: “God is displeased with you, people of Babylonia, that you did not come to Palestine in great masses at the time of Ezra.”<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא ט׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Nevertheless he sometimes also praised the Babylonians and said: “When the Torah was forgotten among Jews, Ezra came out of Babylonia and re-established it anew; later Hillel the Babylonian came and revived it and when it was forgotten for the third time there came Rabbi Chiya and his sons and they re-established it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">32)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוכה כ׳ א׳.</span></i>
More than all other Amoraim Resh Lakish revered Rabbi Chiya. He is said to have fasted three hundred fasts in order to see Rabbi Chiya in his dream but to no avail.<sup class="footnote-marker">33)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי כלאים פרק ט׳ הלכה ד׳; כתובות פרק י״ב הלכה ג׳.</span></i> When he complained about this and said: “Have I not studied as much Torah as he did?”, a Bath-Kol replied: “You have studied as much Torah as he did, but you did not aid in the spread of the Torah as much as he did.”<sup class="footnote-marker">34)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פּ״ה ב׳.</span></i>
The grandson of Rabbi Jehudah, who was then Nasi, disapproved of the privileges of the scholars and he demanded that they should also bear the burden of taxation and that they should share in the expenses of strengthening the gates of the city and of paying the city watchmen. Resh Lakish protested against this demand which would place the scholars on the same level as the rest of the population especially since it was an old custom to liberate scholars from the burden of taxes.
To the other differences of opinion that existed between Rabbi Jochanan and Resh Lakish, we may add the following: When Rabbi Jochanan declared that “the least finger nail of the scholars of old was worth more than the whole bodies of those of today,” Resh Lakish replied: “On the contrary, the worth of the scholars of today is greater, for they devote themselves to the Torah and they ignore the persecution of the government.”<sup class="footnote-marker">35)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא ט׳ ב׳.</span></i>
We have already mentioned that the final altercation between the two occurred in the question of the contamination of knives, when Rabbi Jochanan exclaimed to Resh Lakish that “your business involved knives and therefore you understand their nature.” It is remarkable that Resh Lakish was never offended by references to his old occupation. Frequently he even spoke of it himself and he often introduced his remarks by comparing the situation in question to “two athletes.” It is also told that on one occasion he witnessed a public performance where the people ate and drank and danced and, aroused by past memories of his career, he participated in the gaiety.<sup class="footnote-marker">36)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קהלת רבה פּרשה ט׳ פּיסקא ט״ז.</span></i>
Another time he was asked whether it was permissible to drink water that had remained uncovered, for fear that a snake might have drunk of it and thus have poisoned it. He did not reply directly to this question, but instead he said: “When one sells himself to the gladiators he does so for a high price because he will have to risk his life. Will you sell your life so cheaply?”<sup class="footnote-marker">37)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירזשלמי תרומות פרק ה׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
But the final remark of Rabbi Jochanan offended Resh Lakish to such an extent that he fell sick from worrying and he died soon after. Of this last clash between the two it was further related that Rabbi Jochanan said to Resh Lakish: “Are you not glad that I have brought you under the wings of the Torah?” and Resh Lakish replied: “What good has it done me? There I was called Rabbi (master) and here I am called Rabbi.”
When Resh Lakish was sick, his wife ran to Rabbi Jochanan and implored him to save his life, but Rabbi Jochanan remained stubborn until the death of Resh Lakish. Afterward he was greatly troubled by his conscience; the “right hand” of his learning was lacking. The scholars then gathered and said: “Who will go to console Rabbi Jochanan?” Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath volunteered and as he sat before Rabbi Jochanan, he remarked to every one of his statements: “There is a Rabbinical saying which can substantiate your words.” But Rabbi Jochanan was annoyed at this and said: “Do you think to take the place of Resh Lakish? Ben Lakish asked 24 questions to every statement that I made and I had to find 24 answers to them. The law was thereby clarified. But you merely say that there is a Rabbinical saying which substantiates my words, as if I did not know that myself.”<sup class="footnote-marker">38)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פּ״ד א׳.</span></i>
Many of the expressions of Resh Lakish contain truths which are of permanent validity. Thus he said: “He who mocks others will be doomed to Gehenna”<sup class="footnote-marker">39)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה י״ח ב׳.</span></i> or “If one is angry, even though he be a scholar, his learning will depart from him, and if he be a prophet, the spirit of prophesy will abandon him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">40)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים ס״ג בי.</span></i>
The Nasi once appealed to Resh Lakish saying: “Pray to God for me, for the government mistreats me” and Resh Lakish replied: “If you will take nothing from others, you will have to give away nothing that is yours.”<sup class="footnote-marker">41)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ע״ה פּיסקא י״ב.</span></i>
“He who slanders his neighbors,” Resh Lakish continued, “his sin reaches to heaven and the verse ‘Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment and a babbler is no better’ implies that just as no enchantment can cure the bite of a serpent even such is the harm done by a slanderer. When Messiah will come all the animals will gather and will say to the serpent: ‘If a lion kills his prey, he devours it; a wolf eats that which he has killed, but what pleasure does a snake derive from its bite?’ The snake will then answer: ‘What pleasure has man out of a gossiping tongue?”<sup class="footnote-marker">42)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערכין ט״ו ב׳.</span></i>
Resh Lakish said: “He who raises his hand against his neighbor, even though he did not strike him, he deserves to be called a wicked man,<sup class="footnote-marker">43)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין נ״ח ב׳.</span></i> and he who suspects his neighbor in vain will be punished in that he will do that which he suspected the other of doing.” A similar event occurred to Moses, when God commanded him to go to announce to the Jews that He would redeem them from the bondage of Egypt. Moses then said: ‘How can I say this and they will not believe me?’ God thereupon said to Moses: ‘Jews are a trusting people.’ And when Moses came and spoke to the Jews they believed him. Jews are also descended from believers, for when God said to Abraham, who was then childless, that his children would be like the stars in the sky, he believed Him. Only Moses doubted the word of God when He commanded him to speak to the stone and instead he smote it with his cane.<sup class="footnote-marker">44)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת צ״ז א׳.</span></i>
Repentance—Resh Lakish believed—ranked above all, for one who repents is forgiven even such sins which he committed purposely and they come to be considered as errors. For a penitent they are sometimes even reckoned as good deeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">45)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא פּ״ו ב׳.</span></i> Since everybody knew of his trust in repentance it was related that on the day of his death, two robbers, onetime friends of his, died and their share in the life to come was granted to Resh Lakish.<sup class="footnote-marker">46)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פרקי דר׳ אליעזר פרק מ״ג.</span></i>
Nevertheless, Resh Lakish continued, sinners are so hardened in their wrong doing that even at the gates of death they do not think of repentance.<sup class="footnote-marker">47)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין י״ט א׳.</span></i> And when one wants to point out the shortcomings of another, he should be told: “Adorn yourself first and then you will adorn others.”<sup class="footnote-marker">48)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא ק״ו ב׳, בבא בתרא ס׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Concerning judges and courts, Resh Lakish declared that “one should only heed the judges of his own generation,”<sup class="footnote-marker">49)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קהלת רבה פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא ד׳.</span></i> and “he who appoints an unworthy judge is like a man who plants a tree that Jews might worship idols under it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">50)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ז׳ ב׳, עבודה זרה נ״ב א׳.</span></i> “When a court has to pass sentence it must consider small matters of the same importance as great ones.”<sup class="footnote-marker">51)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ח׳ א׳.</span></i>
On another occasion Resh Lakish said: “He who is merciful when he should be harsh, will in the end be harsh when he should be merciful.” Thus we find that king Saul was merciful to the Amalekites and later he ordered the annihilation of the city of Nob together with its priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">52)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קהלת רבה פּרשה ז׳ פּיסקא ט״ז.</span></i>
When a man lends his neighbor a sum of money to help him rehabilitate himself, he does a kinder deed than if he had given the money in charity. It is better still if one invests the money in partnership, for this makes the other man feel glad that he neither has to borrow nor to take charity.<sup class="footnote-marker">53)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ס״ג א׳.</span></i>
“One who wishes to sin is aided in doing so and one who wishes to turn to better ways is assisted from heaven.”<sup class="footnote-marker">54)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ק״ד א׳, יומא ל״ח ב׳.</span></i>
The biblical verse “the eye of an adulterer guards the night,” he interpreted to indicate that one is an adulterer even if he lusts only with his eyes.”<sup class="footnote-marker">55)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ויקרא רבה פּרשה כ״ג פּיסקא י״ב.</span></i>
The Torah says that “if you abandon me one day I shall abandon you two days.” This he compared to two men one of whom is coming from Sephoris and the other from Tiberias. On the road they meet and continue on their way. But after each has walked one mile, they are already two miles apart.<sup class="footnote-marker">56)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ט׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>
Of the worth of scholars Resh Lakish said the following:
“A scholar may not spend his time in fasting, for he thereby loses time and energy that should be devoted to study.”<sup class="footnote-marker">57)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית י״א ב׳.</span></i>
“A scholar should be shameful and modest as a bride and like her he must also guard his conduct that no shadow of immorality should fall upon them.”<sup class="footnote-marker">58)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שיר השירים רבה פּרשה ב׳ פּיסקא י״א.</span></i>
“When two scholars heed each other in matters of Halacha, God also hears their voices and grants their desires, but when they do not so, they cause the Shechinah to depart from among the Jews. Two scholars who encourage each other are beloved of God.”<sup class="footnote-marker">59)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ס״ג א׳.</span></i>
“It is customary that when two merchants exchange their products, one offers silk and the other pepper; in the end they each have but one article. It is otherwise in learning. One studies the order Zeraim and the other studies the order Nezikin. One scholar then says to the other: Teach me Zeraim and I will teach you Nezikin. In the end they both know double that which they knew at the beginning. Can one possibly imagine a better trade in the world?”<sup class="footnote-marker">60)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תנחומא פּרשת תרומה.</span></i>
Poor as the political situation of the Jews was at that time, the people nevertheless did not give up their hope that redemption was bound to come and that the first step of the liberated Jews would be to restore the temple. But “even if the moment of the restoration of the temple were at hand, children should not be disturbed in their studies.”<sup class="footnote-marker">61)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ט ב׳.</span></i>
Resh Lakish was very particular where the dignity of a scholar was concerned and when a certain wealthy man offended the Amora Rabbi Jehudah bar Chanina, whom Resh Lakish often quoted in matters of law, and he later wished to reconcile him, Resh Lakish told him to donate a pound of gold. On another occasion Resh Lakish said: “He who expectorates in the presence of his Rabbi deserves to be punished by death.”<sup class="footnote-marker">62)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין צ״ט א׳.</span></i> “But if a scholar commits an error he should not be reproved in public.”<sup class="footnote-marker">63)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן י״ז א׳.</span></i>
Sometimes—Resh Lakish said—new interpretations lead to hindrance in the study of the Torah. Thus God commanded Moses to make new tablets in place of those that he had broken and indicated that He approved the breaking of the first tablets.<sup class="footnote-marker">64)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מנחות צ״א א׳.</span></i>
“When afflictions are visited upon the world,” Resh Lakish said, “the Jews are the first ones to suffer from them and when joy is visited upon the world the Jews are also the first to feel it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">65)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">איכה רבתי פּרשה ב׳ פּיסקא ג׳.</span></i>
“In the eyes of God a proselyte is preferred to a Jew, even to those Jews who stood at the foot of Mount Sinai and of whom God is so proud. Why is this so? Because if it were not for the lightning and the thunder and the blowing of the heavenly Shofar at the time of the giving of the Torah the Jews would not have accepted it. But a proselyte who has not seen nor heard all this embraced the Torah of his own free will. Could God love anyone more than him?”<sup class="footnote-marker">66)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תנחומא פּרשת לך לך.</span></i> To this Resh Lakish added that “he who denies the rights of a proselyte, is like one who denies the rights of God.”<sup class="footnote-marker">67)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה ה׳ א׳.</span></i>
“All his life,” Resh Lakish believed, “man should devote to study and even nights were created by God for that purpose.”<sup class="footnote-marker">68)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין ס״ה א׳.</span></i> While strolling once during a Sabbath, Resh Lakish was so immersed in pondering some problem that he unconsciously walked beyond the limit allowed on that day.<sup class="footnote-marker">69)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>

Jehudah and Ezekiah, the Sons of Rabbi Chiya

R<small>ABBI</small> C<small>HIYA</small> R<small>ABA BAR</small> A<small>BA</small> had two sons, Jehudah and Ezekiah. These at one time incurred the displeasure of the Nasi Rabbi Jehudah. As they sat at the table of the Nasi without uttering a word, he commanded his servants that they be served wine to loosen their tongues. His command was obeyed and as the two young men became merry with wine they exclaimed: “Messiah will not come as long as the two ruling houses in Israel, the house of the Exilarch in Babylonia and the house of the Nasi in Palestine, is not destroyed.” As proof of their statement they quoted a passage from the Bible. In great anger the Nasi replied: “Will you throw thorns in my eyes?”<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ל״ח א׳.</span></i> As a result of this altercation the two young men never received ordination although they were both called “Amoraim of the West.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא ע״ה א׳.</span></i> The older brother, Jehudah, is sometimes referred to as Rabbi in the Talmud, but this appears to be an error.
The two brothers died in their youth. It was also said that their birth was unusual, and although they were twins, one of them was three months older than the other (!). The older brother was born at the beginning of the seventh month of pregnancy, while the younger one was born at the end of the ninth month.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ס״ה ב׳.</span></i>
Together with their father Rabbi Chiya, the two young men came to Palestine from Babylonia when they were already of age and well versed in learning. It was then said that the learning in Palestine was in a decline and that Rabbi Chiya and his sons re-established it in the minds of the people.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוכה כ׳ א׳.</span></i> It was also related that as long as they lived it was not necessary to thresh the flax in the country and because of their merit the wine never turned sour.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין פּ״ו א׳, ירושלמי מעשר שני פרק ה׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i> When the land was affected by a drought, the Nasi declared a fast day and he commanded Rabbi Chiya and his sons to pray for rain out of conviction that God would not refuse their prayer.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פּ״ה ב׳.</span></i>
After the death of their father the two sons engaged in tilling the soil,<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ביצה ט׳ ב׳.</span></i> and being so far removed from the academy, they once expressed concern lest their father be troubled in his grave at their neglect of their studies.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות י״ח ב׳.</span></i> This conversation is not entirely clear for, although they were not ordained, they were both known as prominent scholars. Jehudah’s name is often mentioned in the Talmud in connection with various legal matters. Ezekiah was mentioned even more frequently and it appears that he compiled a collection of “Boraithoth.” His opinions are quoted in the Babylonian Talmud with the introducing words “we have learned in the house of Ezekiah” and in the Jerusalem Talmud they are prefaced by the words “Ezekiah taught.”
Jehudah, the older brother, was a son-in-law of Rabbi Jannai Raba and he died during the lifetime of his father-in-law. Jehudah was in the habit of spending his days in the academy and of returning home only at nightfall. When he once failed to appear at the usual time, Rabbi Jannai ordered his bed to be covered believing him to have died.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ס״ב ב׳.</span></i> The reverence with which Rabbi Jannai regarded his son-in-law may be gauged from the following story which is told of their relations. Jehudah always visited his father-in-law each Friday and Rabbi Jannai would seat himself on the top of a high mountain to observe the approach of his son-in-law. As soon as he would see him coming in the distance he would rise out of respect. His disciples asked him for the meaning of his action and explained that his son-in-law equalled Mount Sinai in sanctity and that none was allowed to sit down in front of Sinai.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי בכורים פרק ג׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
Jehudah’s statements on various problems can best be understood when one considers the events of that time and the persecution at the hands of the Romans to which the Jews were subjected when their rights were denied, the academies were destroyed and unbearable taxes were imposed upon them. These persecutions were believed to be a punishment for the sins of man. When many people repented their sins, but the persecutions continued, Jehudah said: “Repentance avails against half of the punishment while prayer may undo all of it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ויקרא רבה פּרשה י׳ פּיסקא ח׳.</span></i> To this he often added that “the suffering of exile brings forgiveness for the second half of the sins, so that one should not suffer in the world to come.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ל״ז ב׳.</span></i>
Because of the numerous afflictions it was at that time customary for a congregation to request one of its members to pray to God for deliverance, but when no aid was in sight many lost their faith. It was then that Jehudah declared that a “scholar who devotes himself to learning despite his needs, his prayers will surely avail.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה מ״ט א׳.</span></i>
Like most of his contemporaries Jehudah highly praised the worth of the Torah and compared it to a healing balm which cures all diseases unlike ordinary cures each of which is effective only for one limb.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין נ״ד א׳.</span></i> Ezekiah expressed a similar sentiment when he said of the Torah that “its words are a crown for one’s head, an adornment for one’s neck, a joy for one’s heart, salve for one’s eyes and balsam for one’s wounds.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ויקרא רבה פּרשה י״ב פּיסקא ג׳.</span></i>
The following are the most characteristic statements of Ezekiah:
“Most important of all is peace. All the commandments a man must observe if they are at hand. When one meets with a situation, he must act in a certain manner, but if he does not meet with it, he is absolved. But where peace is concerned one must go out of his way to seek for it. The value of peace is so great that the Bible refers to all the wanderings of the children of Israel in the desert in the plural (<span dir="rtl">ויסעו ויחנו</span>) because they travelled in discord and they rested in discord, but when they reached Mount Sinai the singular is used (<span dir="rtl">ויחן ישראל</span>) for then they were at peace and united in one wish; it was then that God said: ‘Now the time has come that I should give the Torah to my children.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ויקרא רבה פּרשה ט׳ פּיסקא ט׳.</span></i>
“Well did the prophets do when they described the power of God by comparing the creation to the Creator. Thus they compared the voice of God to the roar of a lion or to the sound of mighty waters, for the human ear can conceive only that which it can hear. Man should likewise be shown only that which he can see.”<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מדרש שוחר טוב פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא ד׳.</span></i>
“He who would add to what he had heard in order to strengthen its impression only succeeds in detracting from it. Thus God commanded not to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, but when Eve spoke to the serpent she added that He had also commanded not to touch the tree. The serpent then pushed Eve until she touched the tree and seeing that she had not died the serpent said: ‘Touching the tree has caused you no harm, neither will you suffer any harm by eating of its fruit.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין כ״ט א׳.</span></i>
After the Jews had made the golden calf, Moses prayed to God to forgive their sin and he reminded Him of His promise to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob to increase their offspring like the stars in the sky. Ezekiah formulated the prayer of Moses in the following words: “Had You sworn by heaven and earth, You could break your oath for heaven and earth may be done away with and You would be free of your oath. But since You swore by Your own name and You are eternal, Your oath is therefore eternal and You must forgive them.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שמות רבה פּרשה מ״ד פּיסקא ח׳.</span></i>
We do not know where Jehudah lived, but mention is made that Ezekiah resided in Tiberias.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה ה׳ ב׳.</span></i> Although Ezekiah was not ordained, he had prominent disciples among whom was Rabbi Jochanan. As long as Ezekiah lived, Rabbi Jochanan did not head an academy.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספות גטין פ״ד ב׳.</span></i>
Both brothers died about the same time and they were buried near their father Rabbi Chiya. Jehudah, the older brother, was buried on the right side of Rabbi Chiya and Ezekiah, the younger brother, on his left side.<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ט א׳.</span></i>

Rabbi Jannai Raba

R<small>ABBI</small> J<small>ANNAI</small> R<small>ABA LIVED IN THE CITY OF</small> A<small>CHBARA</small> (Achbaria) which was located in upper Galilee, one hour’s walk to the south of Safed, and there he was the head of an academy.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושׁלמי ערובין פרק ח׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i> He was never called by his patronymic and he was often referred to as “Raba” (the Great), to distinguish him from other “Amoraim” of the same name.
Rabbi Jannai Raba was a descendant of the priest Eli.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי תענית פרק ד׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i> He was a wealthy man and he owned many fields and gardens.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא י״ד א׳.</span></i> Some talmudic teachers claimed, that he owned as many as 400 vineyards.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן י״ב א׳.</span></i> His daughters were very proud and the man who would marry one of them had to pay him a pot of gold.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושׁין י״א א׳.</span></i>
The disciples of Rabbi Jannai cultivated his fields and vineyards and thus they earned their livelihood. It appears that this condition continued long after Rabbi Jannai died. The laws that were studied in his academy are known in the Talmud as “the Halachoth of the house of Rabbi Jannai.”
Some historians claim that Rabbi Jannai had been a pupil of Rabbi Jehudah HaNasi, but there is no proof of this fact. It is certain however that he was a disciple of Rabbi Chiya, who foretold that he would become a leader among Jews.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות צ״ג א׳, ירושׁלמי דמאי פרק ז׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> In later life he was a colleague of Rabbi Chiya, and R. Jehudah, the son of Rabbi Chiya, was his son-in-law.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ס״ב ב׳, ירושׁלמי בכורים פרק ג׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i> When the Nasi died, Rabbi Jannai announced that all regulations pertaining to Priests were done away with for that day and that every Priest could participate in the burial.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושׁלמי ברכות פרק ג׳ הלכה א׳, נזיר פרק ז׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
Another time it was told that in his old age Rabbi Jannai once met Rabbi Jehudah N’siah II and, fingering the mantle of the Nasi, he remarked: “Your mantle looks like a sack upon you,” thereby hinting that the robe of office did not befit the man. Later he asked the Nasi a question concerning the laws of inheritance and, dissatisfied with the reply, he said to Rabbi Simlai, upon whom he was leaning: “Lead me hence. This man has studied nothing.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא קי״א א׳.</span></i>
It appears that no decrees of unusual severity were issued at that time although the emperors of the period—Caracalla, Makrinus and Heliogabalus—were known for their cruelty. Graetz suggests that the statement of Rabbi Jannai that “we have neither the security of the wicked nor the chastisements of the righteous”<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק ד׳ משׁנה ט״ו.</span></i> refers to the political situation of that day, but according to the “Seder Hadoroth” this statement was uttered by a previous Rabbi Jannai.
Only once did Rabbi Jannai depart from the strict interpretation of the commandments when he advised the Jews to cultivate their fields on a Sabbatical year. The emperor Caracalla then led his armies through Palestine to wage war on the Parthians and he ordered the Jews to till their fields on the Sabbatical year in order to provide food for his armies. Rabbi Jannai’s advice did not imply an attempt to do away with the observance of the Sabbatical year, but was conditioned by the exigencies of the moment.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין כ״ו א׳, ירושׁלמי שׁביעית פרק ד׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
With nostalgic longing Rabbi Jannai spoke of the days of his youth, when young men went out in groups to teach the people. In contradiction to the opinion of Rabbi Jehudah ha-Nasi who advised against teaching in the streets, Rabbi Jannai declared that when scholars teach in the streets they are like fields of balsam which waft their odors far and wide.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שׁיר השׁירים רבה פּרשׁה ה׳ פּיסקא י״א.</span></i>
Rabbi Jannai compared the Torah to a loaf of bread which is suspended on a rope in a house. The foolish man says: “Who can reach this bread?”, but the wise man says: “Has not someone hung up this bread? I will build me a ladder until I reach the bread.” The foolish man similarly says: “Who can learn all the Torah which my master has in his heart?”, but the wise man says: “Has not my master learned his Torah from others? Therefore I will learn two sentences today and two the next day, until I will learn all the Torah of my master.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שׁיר השׁירים רבה פּרשׁה ד׳ פּיסקא ח׳.</span></i> Nevertheless Rabbi Jannai also said that one who studies all his Torah from one master will see no blessing in it,<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה י״ט א׳.</span></i> and he who has studied but has not served scholars may be compared to a pagan.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה כ״ב א׳.</span></i> A priest may eat his “Trumah” on the grave of another priest who was not a scholar, for he does not contaminate,<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תנחומא פּרשׁת תרומה.</span></i> and when Rabbi Jannai met a man who was versed in learning but had no fear of God, he said: “Woe to the people who before they build a house, erect the door.”<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שׁבת ל״א ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jannai was once in his house engaged in study when he suddenly heard a voice in the street calling: “Who would buy a remedy to assure him of life?” Rabbi Jannai sent his daughter to call the merchant, but the merchant said: “Neither you nor those like you need this remedy,” When Rabbi Jannai insisted that he should sell him this remedy, the merchant opened a book of Psalms and showed him the verse: “Who is the man who wants life, who loves to see good days? Guard your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking falsehood.” Rabbi Jannai remarked that king Solomon said the same in Proverbs: “He who guards his mouth and tongue spares himself from trouble.” Finally he gave the merchant six denars for his trouble and he said to his pupils: “All my life I read this verse, but I never understood it in the same sense that I understand it now.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ויקרא רבה פּרשה ט״ז פּיסקא ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jannai was one of those in charge of the distribution of charity in his city, but his own charity he distributed secretly.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערכין ו׳ ב׳.</span></i> When he saw a man giving charity to another in the presence of other people he said: “It were better that you had given nothing, for you shamed the poor man.”<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה ה׳ א׳.</span></i> In this capacity he probably had many opportunities to see people break their promises to contribute to charity. He was always worried at sight of this and he said: “When one makes a vow it is written down in a book in heaven; when the vow is not fulfilled it is also noted down in that book.”<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושׁלמי נדרים פרק א׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i>
“One should never tempt providence,” Rabbi Jannai said, “by standing in a place of danger and expecting a miracle to occur, for no miracle may take place. If a miracle does occur, it will certainly be deducted from the reward of the man in the world to come.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שׁבת ל״ב א׳.</span></i> He avoided depending on miracles to such an extent that he always tested every bridge before he crossed it,<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית כ׳ בי.</span></i> and when he had to go on a journey, he wrote his will so that his family should know what to do in case he did not return.<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושׁלמי ברכות פרק ד׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>
“One must always show respect for royalty,” he said. “Thus we see that when Moses came to announce to Pharaoh that all first born sons would die, he knew that Pharaoh himself would come to ask him to take the Jews out of Egypt. Nevertheless he did not say so to Pharaoh; instead he said that Pharaoh would send his messengers.”<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">זבחים ק״ב א׳.</span></i> The passage stating that all the days of a poor man are evil he explained as referring to a man who is merciful.<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא קמ״ה ב׳.</span></i>
During the days of Rabbi Jehudah N’siah II the Boraitha and the Tosephta were compiled and Rabbi Jannai considered the Boraithoth of Rabbi Chiya to be of the same importance as the Mishna.<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושׁלמי פּסחים פרק א׳ הלכה ה׳, יומא פרק ד׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jannai urged each man upon his morning awakening to add a special prayer, thanking God for returning him to life. In addition he composed the following prayer: “Lord of the world, I have sinned before you! May it be Thy will to grant me a good heart, a good share, good desires, a good name, a good eye, a modest soul and a humble spirit. May Thy name not be profaned through us and preserve us from being the talk of the people. Doom us not to destruction, nor our hopes to frustration, and spare us from depending on the gifts of men whose gifts are small but whose shame is great. Grant that our share be in Your Torah and among those who do Your will and build Your house and Your palace and Your city and Your temple soon in our days.”<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושׁלמי ברכות פרק ד׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jannai survived the rule of four N’siim from Rabbi Jehudah ha-Nasi until the rule of his great grandson Rabbi Jehudah N’siah II. As his death approached he instructed his children that they should not bury him in a white shroud lest he go to Gehenna where he will appear like a groom among mourners, nor in a black shroud lest he go to Paradise where he will appear like a mourner among grooms.<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שׁבת קי״ד א׳.</span></i>

Rabbi Jonathan ben Elazar

A<small>MONG THE DISCIPLES OF</small> R<small>ABBI</small> C<small>HIYA</small>, Rabbi Jonathan ben Elazar, sometimes called <span dir="rtl">״שר הבירה״</span> or <span dir="rtl">״איש הבירה״</span> (the Man of the Capitol), was very prominent. He excelled in Hagada and after he reinterpreted some biblical text it seemed that it had never really been understood before. His deductions were primarily religious and ethical.
The times were such that the masses of the people lost much of their interest in legal disputations and preferred the legendary explanations of the Scriptures and the wondrous stories concerning the heroes of the Bible. These stimulated their imagination and momentarily removed them from their sad realities into a beautiful world of dreams. We therefore find Rabbi Jonathan mentioned hundreds of times in Hagada, but only once in Halacha.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שׁבת מ״ט א׳ וב׳.</span></i>
It appears that Rabbi Jonathan ben Elazar was a grain merchant and that he lived in Sephoris. He was a close friend of Rabbi Chanina bar Chama with whom he frequently discussed various matters. The following story is characteristic of the lifetime of Rabbi Jonathan. As he once came to a merchant to buy lentils, the merchant offered him wheat at a low price but demanded a high price for lentils. Rabbi Jonathan’s relative then instructed him to inquire for the price of wheat whenever he wanted to buy lentils, so that he might obtain it at a low price.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מדרשׁ שׁוחר טוב פּרשׁה י״ב פּיסקא ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jonathan also conducted an academy and one of his most prominent disciples was Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani, who often repeated the Hagadic sayings of Rabbi Jonathan. Rabbi Shmuel came from Babylonia to Palestine to ascertain the meaning of three biblical verses of which he was in doubt. He met Rabbi Jonathan who gave him a satisfactory explanation. Another version declares that he met Rabbi Jonathan in the street, but the latter refused to answer his questions there and instructed him to visit the academy where he would teach him the meaning of these verses. Rabbi Shmuel attempted to prove that it was permissible to teach the Torah in the street and he quoted Proverbs (1:20) to prove his contention. But Rabbi Jonathan declared that the reference was not to an ordinary street, but to a highway of learning. He added further that one does not sell precious stones in a vegetable market.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תנחומא בחוקותי פּיסקא נ׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Shmuel related that whenever Rabbi Jonathan came to the passage, “For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it” (Isaiah 28:20), he explained it to mean that the whole world is too small for God to share its rule with any other power.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא ט׳ ב׳, סנהדרין ק״ג א׳.</span></i> This statement of Rabbi Jonathan is no doubt part of his argument against people who believed in dual rule out of conviction that God could not alone govern the world and required the assistance of another.
Rabbi Jonathan was always kind to those he came in contact with and there is no mention of any outburst of anger on his part. But he was strict with Rabbi Simlai, who later became one of the outstanding exponents of Hagada; he said to Rabbi Simlai: “It is a tradition of my forefathers not to teach Hagada to a Babylonian nor to an inhabitant of the south, for these possess vain pride and little Torah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושׁלמי פּסחים פרק ה׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
The problem of fair judgment in Jewish courts was then of paramount importance and of this Rabbi Jonathan said: “One who sits in judgment should consider that a sword hangs over his head and the pit of damnation opens at his feet,<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ק״ט בי.</span></i> for every judge who passes just sentence causes the Shechinah to dwell among Jews, but one who is unjust drives the Shechinah away and a judge who illegally deprives one man of his possessions and gives them to another will lose his life.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ז׳ א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jonathan’s custom when passing sentence in a dispute was illustrated by the following story: Rabbi Jonathan lived in the neighborhood of a Roman and the branches of a tree in his garden overhung the property of the Roman, who did not complain about this for a long time. One day two men came to Rabbi Jonathan to decide a dispute between them which involved such a case of an overhanging tree. Rabbi Jonathan heard the arguments of the contending parties and told them to return on the following day when he would pass sentence. The Roman was anxious to hear his decision and if he was to command that the tree be cut down, he would ask him, why he did not do so to his own tree. That evening Rabbi Jonathan had his tree trimmed of all branches overhanging the property of the Roman and when the litigants appeared on the following day, he commanded them to do likewise. To the query of the Roman, he replied: “My tree has been trimmed since the previous night.”
Another story concerns a woman who brought a basket of figs as a gift to Rabbi Jonathan. He refused the gift and he asked the woman to take the basket back with her; if the basket of figs had been covered when she brought it then she should take it away covered, but if it had been uncovered then she should carry it out uncovered lest people should suspect that she had brought a basket of gold but was taking back a basket of figs.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושׁלמי בבא בתרא פרק ב׳ הלכה י״א.</span></i>
“He who commits a good deed,” Rabbi Jonathan said, “will be rewarded for it in the world to come and he who commits an evil deed will be followed by it until judgment day.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה ג׳ ב׳, עבודה זרה ה׳ א׳.</span></i>
Seven different sins bring punishment upon the whole world and the innocent suffer for them together with guilty; these sins are: slander, bloodshed, false oath, immorality, pride, robbery and envy.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערכין ט״ז א׳.</span></i> Punishment for these sins is visited during a time when there are wicked men and the punishment first affects the just men.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא ט׳ א׳.</span></i>
He who teaches Torah to the son of another man deserves to sit among the angels and one who teaches Torah to the son of an Am Haaretz, God will undo all decrees against Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פּ״ה א׳.</span></i> It is a worthy deed for a man to point out to his neighbor the evil of his ways and one who does so with pious intention merits the grace of God,<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תמיד כ״ח א׳.</span></i> but it is a sin to slander another person. However, should one do so to quarrelsome people then he has committed no sin, for against such people anything may be said.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושׁלמי פּאה פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
We may assume that Rabbi Jonathan disapproved of the kindness of the Romans, for he declared: “The curse of Achijah of Shilo was preferable to the blessing of Balaam. Achijah cursed the Jews that they should shake like the reed which grows in the water, but water reeds are deeply rooted and no wind can uproot them; after the wind calms down the reed remains upright in its place. But Balaam blessed the Jews that they should be like cedar trees growing near water and even though all other winds will not budge a cedar tree, a south wind will uproot it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית כ׳ א׳.</span></i>
When Rabbi Jonathan heard the words of the pagans who could not understand how the Jews clung to their faith despite all suffering and persecutions he said: “Other nations wish to know what is our consolation in time of need and how we withstand the anger of our God; we must tell them that even though He punishes us, He immediately heals us of our suffering and creates us anew.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אגדת בראשׁית פּרשׁה ח׳.</span></i> In line with this point of view was also Rabbi Jonathan’s explanation of the origins of storms and he said: “When God remembers that His children suffer among the Gentiles a sigh escapes Him and such sighs cause storms.”<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות נ״ט א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani quoted Rabbi Jonathan as follows: “When Moses was writing the Torah and he reached the verse ‘Let us make man’, Moses said to God, ‘Why do You give unbelievers an opportunity to say that You did not create man alone?’ but God replied: ‘Write as you are told and he who would err may err.’ Later God added: ‘Moses, these people whom I created consist of large ones and small ones and I give them an example that the great ones should consult the small ones before doing anything even as I consulted the angels before creating man.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ח׳ פּיסקא ז׳.</span></i>
When God completed the creation of the world, He looked upon it and found it good in His eyes. Rabbi Jonathan compared this to a king who was giving his daughter in marriage and who prepared a beautiful canopy for the bride. As the king looked upon the canopy he said to his daughter: “Daughter, may I always be as pleased with this canopy as I am pleased now.” God likewise looked at that which He had created and said to the world: “May I always be as pleased with you as I am pleased with you now.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשׁית רבה פּרשׁה ט׳ פּיסקא ד׳.</span></i>

Rabbi Oshaia Raba

R<small>ABBI</small> O<small>SHAIA WAS A DISCIPLE</small> of Bar Kapara and Rabbi Chiya Raba. The title “Raba” was added to his name, to distinguish him from a later “Amora” of the same name.
Collaborating with his master Rabbi Chiya, Rabbi Oshaia compiled over seventy Boraithoth and it became an accepted rule to doubt the authencity of any Boraitha which was not examined and explained by these two,<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין קמ״א א׳.</span></i> for—as Rashi explains—they were careful to repeat every word as it was originally said unlike the other scholars who often added to the texts which they received.
Some scholars even referred to Rabbi Oshaia as “the father of the Mishna.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושׁלמי בבא קמא פרק ד׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i> But primarily he was the first commentator on the Mishna because of his position as disciple of Rabbi Chiya who passed on to him the opinions which he had heard from Rabbi Jehudah. The Boraithoth of Rabbi Oshaia are therefore referred to as “the great Mishnayoth.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושׁלמי הוריות פרק ג׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Oshaia was descended from a family of scholars and his father, R. Chama bar Bisa, was highly respected by Rabbi Jehudah who called him “a great man.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדה י״ד ב׳.</span></i> Rabbi Oshaia was at first a pupil of Bar-Kapara and later of Rabbi Chiya.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושׁלמי שׁבת פרק ג׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> It appears that he also studied with Rabbi Ephes for some time and he accompanied him on a journey to Antioch in the interests of the people. In addition he maintained close relations with Rabbi Jehudah N’siah the first.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ביצה פרק א׳ הלכה י״א, בבא קמא פרק ב׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
Throughout the lifetime of Rabbi Jehudah N’siah the first Oshaia attended his academy at Sephoris and it was his duty to go to Ein Tov every month to question the witnesses concerning the appearance of the new moon in order to determine the beginning of the new month. As long as it was possible it was customary to hear such testimony in a city of Judea and the Nasi who lived in Galilee maintained a court in Ein Tov.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושׁלמי נדרים פרק ו׳ הלכה ח׳.</span></i>
Of Rabbi Chama, the father of Rabbi Oshaia, it was said that he engaged in study away from home for twelve years. When he returned and entered the academy he did not recognize his son. In the discussion that followed Rabbi Chama was amazed at the learning of the young man and he felt grieved that he had been away for so long and had neglected the education of his son. As he came home he was met by his son, but he thought that the young man followed him to continue the discussion and he rose out of reverence. His wife then remarked to him: “Who has ever seen a father rise to greet his son?”<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ס״ב ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Chama was a judge together with Bar-Kapara during the lifetime of Rabbi Jehudah<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ב א׳.</span></i> and he is frequently mentioned in the Talmud as the father of Rabbi Oshaia.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושׁלמי מועד קטן פרק ג׳ הלכה ה׳, נדה פרק ב׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Bisa, the grandfather of Rabbi Oshaia, was also a scholar and at least on one occasion he sided with his grandson against his father in some legal question.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא נ״ט ב׳.</span></i> Various legal opinions of Rabbi Bisa were also quoted by the scholars at Caesarea.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושׁלמי גטין פרק ד׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>
Following the death of Rabbi Jehudah N’sia the first, the Nasi was no longer the head of the Sanhedrin and Rabbi Oshaia established an academy in Caesarea which was attended by many scholars.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושׁלמי תרומות פרק י׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i> The Christian Church-father Origines appears to have had religious discussions with Rabbi Oshaia and during one of these (the Midrash there mentions the name as “Philosophos” instead of Origines) he was asked why God had not commanded Adam to practice circumcision if this commandment was of such great significance. Rabbi Oshaia replied with a counter question: “Why do men shave the hair on their heads but not their beards?”<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">The question of Rabbi Oshaia was in accord with the oriental custom of allowing the beard to grow which was also followed by Origines. It could not have applied to the Romans who shaved their beards but allowed the hair on their heads to grow.</i> Origines replied: “Because the hair on one’s head grows since childhood when man was still foolish, but the beard begins to grow when man attains wisdom.”
“According to your answer,” Rabbi Oshaia said, “I could say that man should gouge his eyes or cut off his arms or break his legs, since these have grown with him since childhood. But the matter is entirely different for everything that was created requires improvement. Thus there are various bitter herbs which man eats after they are sweetened; wheat cannot be eaten as it grows, but must first be ground and only then can it be kneaded and baked. It is likewise true of man that he needs to be improved.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשׁית רבה פּרשׁה י״א פּיסקא ז׳.</span></i>
Among the prominent followers of Rabbi Oshaia there was Rabbi Jochanan who declared that Rabbi Oshaia was as great in his generation as Rabbi Meir had been in his and even as Rabbi Meir was often misunderstood by his contemporaries, likewise were Rabbi Oshaia’s ways often misunderstood.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין נ״ג א׳.</span></i> Another disciple was Rabbi Pinchas, who gathered all the lectures of Rabbi Oshaia and these were later included in “Midrash Raba” on the book of Genesis.
Rabbi Oshaia was a poor man and the Nasi often aided him. On a certain Purim he sent him meat and wine and Rabbi Oshaia told him that he had fulfilled both commandments of sending gifts to one’s friends and donations to the poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה ז׳ א׳, ירושׁלמי מגלה פרק א׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>
The following are some of the statements of Rabbi Oshaia:
He who strives for perfection in his conduct will certainly succeed, but one who is vainly proud will go to Gehenna.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה י״ח א׳.</span></i>
Why are the words of the Torah compared to water, wine and milk? These three liquids may be kept in cheap vessels and the words of the Torah are retained only by those who are humble.<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית ז׳ א׳.</span></i>
God was gracious to the Jews in that he scattered them among the nations and thus saved them from annihilation. When they suffer in one country, they are treated kindly in another land.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים פּ״ו ב׳.</span></i>
Speaking of the same subject on another occasion, he explained it with a passage from the Bible. When Esau came to meet Jacob, Jacob had said: “If Esau come to the company and smite it (referring to the Jews in Palestine), then the other company which is left shall escape” (referring to the Jews in the lands of the Diaspora). But although the Jews in the Diaspora do not suffer as much as we do, they nevertheless fast every Monday and Thursday to intercede with God in our behalf.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשׁית רבה פּרשׁה ע״ו פּיסקא ג׳.</span></i>
When Jews obey their leaders but the leaders do not that which is necessary than the blame is with the leaders. It is as if one blackens his hands and then wipes them on the wall; the wall is blackened thereby but his hands do not become clean.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">דברים רבה פּרשׁה א׳ פּיסקא ח׳.</span></i>
The prophet Zechariah said: Behold I take two canes, one of them I call “Noam” (pleasant) and the other I call “Chovlim” (pain). We may say that “Noam” refers to the scholars of Palestine and “Chovlim” refers to the scholars of Babylonia who cause each other pain with their constant doubts and questions while the scholars of Palestine are dear and pleasant to each other; they sit together and in study each improves the words of the other until the law becomes clarified.<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין כ״ב א׳.</span></i>

Rabbi Chanina bar Chama

R<small>ABBI</small> C<small>HANINA BAR</small> C<small>HAMA WAS ONE OF THE FIRST</small> “Amoraim” in Palestine, called also Rabbi Chanina the Great.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית כ״ז ב׳, יבמות מ״ג א׳, ירושלמי יבמות פרק ב׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> He was a priest and it was said that he always returned to parents the money which he received at the ceremony of “redeeming a first-born son.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בכורות נ״א ב׳.</span></i> He was said to devote himself to healing and he was acquainted with the nature of serpents.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא מ״ט א׳, ירושלמי תרומות פרק ח׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Chanina was born in Babylonia and he came to Palestine to study with Rabbi Jehudah ha-Nasi after he was already the father of a son whom he brought with himself. He then settled in Sephoris where the academy of Rabbi Jehudah was situated, but for some unknown reason he was not liked by the inhabitants of the city. Thus it was related that an epidemic once broke out in Sephoris, but it did not affect the street where Rabbi Chanina resided. The people were angered and said that he refused to pray for them, but Rabbi Chanina denied that his prayer could be of any avail as long as they conducted themselves immorally. Another time a drought occurred and although a fast day was declared no rain fell. Rabbi Chanina was then blamed and it was said that because he spoke evil of the people, God refused to heed their prayers.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי תענית פרק ג׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>
When Rabbi Chanina arrived in Palestine, he was already well versed in the Scriptures, but this knowledge hindered his career, for it incurred the displeasure of Rabbi Jehudah, whom he once corrected. Rabbi Jehudah at that time remarked: “Where and from whom have you learned until now?” “From Rav Hamnuna the Scribe,” Rabbi Chanina replied. “Then go to Rav Hamnuna and have him ordain you,” Rabbi Jehudah exclaimed.
Only when the Nasi was nearing his death, did he command his son Rabban Gamliel to ordain Rabbi Chanina and to seat him in the first row in the academy. But Rabbi Chanina refused the last honor saying that Rabbi Ephes was older and therefore deserved the foremost seat.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ק״ג ב׳.</span></i> Rabbi Chanina believed that this act accounted for his long life and health, for even after he was eighty years of age, he could balance himself on one foot while removing his shoes. He added by saying: “The fact that my mother bathed me in warm water and anointed me with oil during my childhood contributed to my long life.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין כ״ד ב׳.</span></i>
But although Rabbi Chanina was not ordained during the lifetime of Rabbi Jehudah, he was nevertheless highly respected by him, and whenever Rabbi Jehudah visited the representative of the emperor or was visited by him, Rabbi Chanina was always at his side.
One time, as Rabbi Chanina went on some mission to the Roman governor at Caesarea accompanied by Rabbi Joshua ben Levi, the governor arose to greet the messengers. His friends then asked him: “Why do you rise to greet Jews?”, and the governor replied: “These Jews resemble angels.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ה׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
From various expressions of Rabbi Chanina we gather that he was acquainted with the science of medicine and people often turned to him for medical advice.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא מ״ט א׳.</span></i> But although he believed that all actions are determined from above and that one does not even stir a finger unless it has been so determined in heaven,<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין ז׳ ב׳.</span></i> he nevertheless declared that fevers and chills were exceptions,<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא ק״ז ב׳, בבא בתרא קמ״ד ב׳.</span></i> and that 99 out of 100 people died through their own fault in not avoiding colds.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שבת פרק י״ד הלכה ג׳.</span></i> He likewise said: “Why do the people of Babylonia escape the skin ailment known as <span dir="rtl">ראתן</span>? It is because they eat a herb called <span dir="rtl">תרדין</span> which grows among the thorns. This herb they mix with a special kind of wine fermented from dates.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ע״ז ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Chanina was modest toward his master, but he consciously maintained his dignity among his colleagues. When he met Rabbi Chiya at the death of Rabbi Jehudah there arose a dispute between them as to who did more for the advancement of the Torah and Rabbi Chanina declared that if the Torah were to be forgotten entirely, he could reconstitute it with his “pilpul.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ק״ג ב׳.</span></i> It is also related that Rav (Aba Arecha) once read a chapter of the Torah before Rabbi Jehudah; as Rabbi Chiya entered in the middle of the reading, Rav began to read from the beginning again; then Bar-Kapara entered and again he reread the chapter. He repeated this also when Rabban Simeon, the son of the Nasi, entered in the middle of the reading, but when Rabbi Chanina entered, he refused to begin the chapter anew. This offended Rabbi Chanina and on thirteen successive eves of the Day of Atonement Rav visited Rabbi Chanina to ask his forgiveness, but the latter would not become reconciled.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא פ״ז ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Chanina maintained a close friendship with nearly all the contemporary Amoraim. One of these was Rabbi Jochanan, later the editor of the Jerusalem Talmud, who was first his pupil and later his close friend. Due to differences of opinion with Rabbi Chanina, Rabbi Jochanan left Sephoris and settled in Tiberias,<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ביצה פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> but these differences did not weaken their friendship and Rabbi Jochanan often visited his master in Sephoris.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ויקרא רבה פּרשה כ״א פּיסקא ז׳.</span></i> When Rabbi Chanina fell sick before his death, Rabbi Jochanan went to visit him, but on the road he met a man of Sephoris and he asked him: “What new things have happened in your city?” and the man replied: “A great rabbi died and everybody is hurrying to the funeral.” Rabbi Jochanan then understood that Rabbi Chanina had died and he rent his garments as a sign of mourning.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי בבא מציעא פרק ב׳ הלכה י״א.</span></i> Others told that Rabbi Jochanan carried thirteen garments to wear and that he tore all of them exclaiming: “The man who nourished me with Torah has gone.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ד א׳.</span></i>
Every word which Rabbi Chanina had heard directly from Rabbi Jehudah, or which he heard repeated in the name of Rabbi Jehudah, he considered to be sacred and he would not deviate from it. In all questions that arose, Rabbi Chanina relied on the conduct of Rabbi Jehudah in similar cases and whenever a question arose to which Rabbi Chanina could find no answer in the Mishna, he consulted his colleagues and even his disciples. Rabbi Jochanan and Resh Lakish were thus greatly surprised when he asked their opinion in a matter which could easily be explained; but Rabbi Chanina said to them: “May evil come upon me if I ever made any statement which I have not previously heard from Rabbi Jehudah as many times as I have hair on my head. In all matters of law I would observe the conduct of Rabbi on three occasions in similar cases, but this matter concerning which I asked you I only witnessed Rabbi Jehudah observe twice. I therefore asked your opinion in order that it should be as if I had seen it observed a third time.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי נדה פרק ב׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i>
This strict adherence to tradition and the constant repetition of opinions of previous authorities was disapproved of by the other scholars of the time who did not want to allow the interpretation of the Torah to lose its vitality. Many of them therefore left Rabbi Chanina and opened academies of their own. But these differences were only theoretical and did not diminish the personal regard which they felt for each other. On the contrary, Rabbi Chanina was always glad of the honor which was bestowed upon his pupils of the past.
Thus it is told that as he was once strolling in the street he saw all people abandon their work and don festive garments. He asked what the occasion for rejoicing was and he was told: “Your pupil Rabbi Jochanan has arrived and he will lecture at the academy; everybody therefore hastens to hear him.” Rabbi Chanina then pronounced the blessing of “Schehechayanu” that he had lived to see the honor accorded to his disciple.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי הוריות פרק ג׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Chanina gained his livelihood from trade in honey. On one occasion he sold a large quantity of fig honey and from the considerable profit which he realized by this transaction he built the academy at Sephoris.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי פּאָה פרק ז׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
His love for Palestine was indescribable. It was said that wherever he went he removed the stones and other hindrances from the way in order to smooth the road and to improve it. He was said to be able to distinguish between the soil of Palestine and soil of other lands by merely taking a lump of it in his hand. When one of his young pupils, Rabbi Simeon bar Aba, asked him whether he should go to a foreign land and requested a letter of recommendation to the scholars in Babylonia, Rabbi Chanina said to him: “I cannot give it to you, for tomorrow I may see your parents (I may die) and they may complain to me that they had owned a beautiful flower in Palestine and that I had allowed it to be transplanted to a foreign land.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי מועד קטן פרק ג׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
From Rabbi Chanina’s statements it is obvious that he believed that God rewards man according to his deeds and even though judgment may be delayed it was certain that God would not overlook anyone’s sins, for whatever He does is done in a spirit of justice.<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא נ׳ א׳.</span></i> It is therefore better that man should sin secretly, if he does so, and should not profane the name of God in public.<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין מ׳ א׳.</span></i>
But although Rabbi Chanina believed that all man’s actions were controlled from above even to the extent of stirring a finger, he nevertheless added that “fear of God” was dependent on the individual.<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ל״ג ב׳.</span></i> Regarding relations between people Rabbi Chanina said: “He who raises his hand against his neighbor, even though he does not strike him, has already sinned. He who strikes a Jew, is like one who struck the Shechinah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין נ״ח ב׳.</span></i>
“There are people,” Rabbi Chanina said, “who sin on earth, but do not sin against heaven; then there are others who sin against heaven but do not sin on earth, but he who engages in slander sins both against heaven and against earth.”<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קהלת רבה פּרשה ט׳ פּיסקא י״ג.</span></i>
“There are various kinds of wicked men. Some are sly and these are worse than the ordinary sinner, for they always prove their innocence. During a trial, for instance, such a man comes before the judge before the other party has arrived and he presents his arguments thereby influencing the judge in his favor. A judge must therefore be careful not to heed the words of one of the sides until the opposing side is also present.”<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ז׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Like other scholars Rabbi Chanina also praised charity and he said: “Charity may be compared to a garment. The stuff of a garment is woven out of single threads. Charity likewise is gathered in single coins until it accumulates into a considerable sum.”<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא ט׳ ב׳.</span></i> “In the distribution of charity scholars should be considered first, for he who shames a scholar should be considered a heretic who does not deserve a share in the world to come.”<sup class="footnote-marker">30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין צ״ט א׳.</span></i> “He who shows ill will toward scholars in this world will have his ears filled with smoke in the world to come,”<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא ע״ה א׳.</span></i> “but one who gains the approval of his teachers is certain of a share in the world to come.”<sup class="footnote-marker">32)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קע״ג א׳.</span></i>
At the same time scholars are obliged to teach all those who wish to learn and a scholar who refuses to read a chapter of the Scriptures or to teach a chapter of the Mishna to one who requests it by saying “Leave me! I have not the strength for it,” to him God says: “The time will come when you will in truth not have the strength to teach.”<sup class="footnote-marker">33)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">איכה רבתי פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא ל״ח.</span></i>
Rabbi Chanina believed in the influence of stars (<span dir="rtl">מזל</span>) on human life. “The stars make one wise and also rich,” he said. In contradistinction to those who said, “Jews have no stars,”<sup class="footnote-marker">34)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדרים ל״ב ב׳.</span></i> Rabbi Chanina declared that “Jews have stars.”<sup class="footnote-marker">35)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קנ״ו ב׳.</span></i>
The Sabbath he considered to be the most important day of the week which should be honored by wearing special garments. Every man, he said, should have two sets of garments, one for week days and the other for the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">36)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי פּאה פרק ח׳ הלכה ח׳.</span></i> Each Sabbath eve Rabbi Chanina donned his Sabbath garments and said to his friends and disciples: “Let us go to greet the queen Sabbath.”<sup class="footnote-marker">37)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ט א׳.</span></i>
Like his contemporaries Rabbi Chanina met with suffering but he did not allow these to influence his attitude toward life and he always controlled his reactions. Only once did he omit his daily prayer due to anger.<sup class="footnote-marker">38)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עריבין ס״ה א׳.</span></i> When his daughter died, he did not weep. His wife thereupon chided him and said: “Even when a hen is lost from the house one regrets it.” But Rabbi Chanina replied: “One cannot bear two griefs. I suffer enough that I am now childless, must I also weep until I become blind?”<sup class="footnote-marker">39)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קנ״א ב׳.</span></i> Rabbi Chanina also did not mourn when his son, Shivchath, died. He accepted it as a just act of God and merely said that his son died because he “cut down the fig before it was time.”<sup class="footnote-marker">40)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא צ״א ב׳, בבא בתרא כ״ו א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Chanina scolded the inhabitants of his city for their immorality and he said: “During the time of Moses there was one Zimri and 24 thousand Jews lost their lives on his account. In this generation we have many Zimri’s. Why then should we complain if God punishes us?”<sup class="footnote-marker">41)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי תענית פרק ג׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>
When asked to what he ascribed his long life, Rabbi Chanina sometimes explained it by natural reasons as due to the warm baths and the anointment with oil which he received as a child. At other times he ascribed it to the fact that he gave up the foremost seat in the academy, which was offered to him by the Nasi to Rabbi Ephes, or to the special effort which he made by going out of his way on the road from Sephoris to Tiberias in order to greet Rabbi Simeon ben Chalafta.<sup class="footnote-marker">42)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי תענית פרק ד׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>

Rabbi Joshua ben Levi

R<small>ABBI</small> J<small>OSHUA BEN</small> L<small>EVI BELONGED</small> to the first and second generations of “Amoraim” who were influential after the death of Rabbi Jehudah ha-Nasi. Among these he occupied an important position and his life history was surrounded with wondrous legends. It was said that he spoke to the prophet Elijah as one speaks to an equal and that he obtained from him whatever he requested. When in doubt concerning the meaning of some passage he would send Elijah to inquire its meaning from the deceased Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ל״ה פּיסקא ב׳.</span></i> Often he prayed for rain and his prayer was never denied. It was even told that he spoke to Messiah who revealed to him the time of his coming, and when the angel of death finally came to take his soul, he succeeded in outwitting him and in entering paradise alive.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ע״ז ב׳.</span></i>
Some people claimed that Rabbi Joshua was a son of Levi ben Sisi who had been a disciple of Rabbi Jehudah. But this appears to be unlikely since Levi ben Sisi came from Babylonia whereas Rabbi Joshua was a Palestinian, also, had he been the son of the renowned Tana, he would have quoted his father in legal matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות מ״ה א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Joshua was a pupil of many of the scholars of his time. For a time he even attended the academy of Rabbi Jehudah whose legal observances he later quoted. The high esteem in which Rabbi Joshua was held here is apparent from the fact that one of his statements was included in the “Boraithoth” to the tractate of Aboth. This statement declares that every day a “Bath Kol” is heard from Mount Horeb announcing: “Woe to those who allow the Torah to be put to shame.”
Rabbi Joshua lived in Judea, in the city of Lud where he was born and where he also headed an academy. We may assume that he was already prominent during the days of Rabbi Chiya, for it was told that Rabbi Chiya once visited him in Lud and in honor of the guest 24 different courses were served. Rabbi Chiya was surprised and asked what they did on the Sabbath if so many courses were offered during a week day. Rabbi Joshua then told him that the number of courses was doubled on Saturday. Some time later Rabbi Joshua visited Rabbi Chiya and the latter gave his pupils several golden ducats with which to buy food for a repast such as Rabbi Joshua was accustomed.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">איכה רבתי פּרשה ג׳ פּיסקא ז׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Joshua often visited Sephoris where the Sanhedrin convened and he was a close friend of Rabbi Chanina bar Chama, the head of the academy at Sephoris. He also accompanied him once on a trip to the proconsul at Caesarea on a mission of the people.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ח׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> It was related that Rabbi Joshua ordained all his pupils irrespective of whether the Nasi approved.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי חגיגה פרק א׳ הלכה ח׳.</span></i> Nevertheless he recognized the authority of the Nasi and considered his opinions to be law.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי מועד קטן פרק ג׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> When his son, Rav Joseph, married the daughter of the Nasi he considered it to be a great honor and even accorded honor to his son, always remarking that he did so out of respect for the Nasi.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ל״ג ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Joshua was an authority in both Halacha and Hagada, but from some of his declarations we gather that he did not approve of Hagada. Thus he opposed comitting Hagada to writing and he said that “he who writes down an Hagada will have no share in the world to come; he who studies it will suffer humiliation and he who listens to it will receive no reward.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מסכת סופרים פרק ט״ז הלכה ב׳.</span></i>
His love for the Torah and his veneration of scholars exceeded all bounds and he said: “Beware of an old man who has forgotten his learning, for the broken tablets were kept in the Ark together with the whole ones.” Likewise he declared that “one who speaks evil of a scholar is doomed to “Gehenna” and that there were 24 instances when a court could excommunicate a person for showing disrespect to a scholar.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ח׳ בי, י״ט א׳.</span></i> “He who teaches Torah to his son is like one who received the Torah from mount Horeb.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות כ״א ב׳.</span></i> He also considered it to be a means of curing bodily ailments and he said: “One who suffers from a headache should turn to study.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין נ״ד א׳.</span></i>
But although he wished every one to study he nevertheless said that slaves must not be taught,<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות כ״ח א׳.</span></i> and he also believed that no scholar could discover anything new, for “everything which a bright pupil will reveal before his master has already been said to Moses on Mount Sinai.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי פּאה פרק ב׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i>
Prayer he held to be of equal significance and he instructed his children to “rise early and hasten in the evening to the synagogue and you will gain long life.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ח׳ א׳.</span></i> Every one should strive to be among the first ten to arrive at the synagogue,<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות מ״ז ב׳.</span></i> and at prayer one should stand by the wall. Likewise one should never pass by a synagogue when prayers are said without desiring to enter.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ח׳ ב׳.</span></i> He who answers Amen during Kadish is certain to have all decrees against him annulled,<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ט א׳.</span></i> and when prayers come smoothly from one’s lips, one may feel sure that they have been accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ח׳ הלכה ח׳.</span></i>
Repentance was then held to be of great merit and Rabbi Joshua said that “the Jews have made the golden calf only in order to have an opportunity to repent and to demonstrate the power of repentance.”<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה ד׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Like many of his contemporaries Rabbi Joshua often disputed with the “Minim” (early Christians), but he based his arguments on sentiment rather than on logic. This gave rise to the opinion that his opposition to Hagada was a result of the fact that the “Minim” often used biblical passages to uphold their views. One of the “Minim” especially caused much trouble to Rabbi Joshua and he was ready to curse him, but he remembered that God had mercy on all his creatures and he refrained.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ז׳ א׳.</span></i>
The following are characteristic statements of Rabbi Joshua:

Although Rabbi Joshua was of a delicate constitution and he had to wear shoes on the Day of Atonement,<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי יומא פרק ה׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> he nevertheless fasted two days in succession during the month of Ab—the ninth and the tenth—for the temple was burned on the tenth of Ab but it caught fire on the ninth.<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי תענית פרק ד׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i>
We have previously mentioned the “intimacy” between Rabbi Joshua and Elijah which legends described. One of these legends relates that Rabbi Joshua once met Elijah at the mouth of the cave where Rabbi Simeon bar Yochai hid for thirteen years and he asked him when Messiah would come. Elijah replied that he would have to ask Messiah and Rabbi Joshua said: “Did I but know where he is I would ask him.”
Then Elijah said: “He sits at the gate of the great city” (referring to Antioch or Caesarea where the Romans had their camp). He also gave him a token whereby he could recognize him saying that Messiah sat among the sick beggars.
Rabbi Joshua then approached Messiah and said to him: “Peace be with you my lord and my teacher,” and Messiah replied: “Peace to you, son of Levi.”
“When will the lord come?” Rabbi Joshua asked, and Messiah answered: “Today.”
Rabbi Joshua returned to Elijah and related to him what Messiah had said. Elijah explained that the greeting of Messiah was an indication that both Rabbi Joshua and his father were assured of a share in the world to come. When Rabbi Joshua complained that Messiah had deceived him in saying that he would arrive on that day, Elijah informed him that he would have come that day, had every one obeyed the will of God as is indicated by the Biblical verse: “This day, if you will heed his voice.”<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין צ״ח א׳.</span></i>
Another legend related that a man had been devoured by a lion three miles from where Rabbi Joshua lived. This caused Elijah not to appear to R. Joshua for three days, because Elijah felt that R. Joshua should have prayed to God that such an occurrence should not have happened so near his home.<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכות י״א א׳.</span></i>
Legend coupled the name of Rabbi Joshua with the prophet Elijah on still another occasion. A certain man, Ula ben Kushab, had incurred the anger of the Roman authorities and soldiers were sent to capture and to execute him. But this man hid in the house of Rabbi Joshua and the soldiers surrounded the city and threatened to destroy it, if the man was not handed over to them. Rabbi Joshua then persuaded the man to surrender to the Romans and thus save the city. He even pointed out that a law in the Mishna permitted surrendering a man to the government when a whole city was threatened as was the case at Abel when Joab besieged the city and the inhabitants gave him the head of Sheva ben Bichri who had revolted against king David.<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">This proof of Rabbi Joshua is contained in Tosephta (<span dir="rtl">תרומות פרק ז׳ הלכה כ״ג</span>) and not in the Mishna.</i>
After Ula bar Kushab surrendered to the Romans, Elijah failed to appear to Rabbi Joshua for a long time. Rabbi Joshua then fasted a number of times and Elijah finally appeared to him. When he was asked why he did not appear for such a long time, Elijah replied: “How could I appear before an informer?”
“Have I not acted according to the Mishna?” Rabbi Joshua asked. But Elijah retorted: “Is this a Mishna to be observed by pious people? A man like you should not have been involved in this matter.”<sup class="footnote-marker">30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי תרומות פרק ח׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Joshua also maintained friendly relations with the angel of death whom he deceived when the latter came to take his soul. He asked the angel of death to show him his place in Paradise and the angel gave him his sword to carry on the way as a token that he would not harm him. When they reached the gate of Paradise, Rabbi Joshua jumped in alive. The angel of death seized his garment in an attempt to hold him back, but Rabbi Joshua escaped. The angel then begged for his sword, but Rabbi Joshua refused to return it until a Bath Kol commanded: “Return the sword for the world needs it.”
Glad to have regained his sword, the angel of death departed and the prophet Elijah proceeded before Rabbi Joshua announcing: “Make way for the son of Levi.” As Rabbi Joshua looked about himself, he saw Rabbi Simeon bar Yochai seated on thirteen rugs of gold. Rabbi Simeon asked him: “Are you the son of Levi?” and Rabbi Joshua replied that he was. “Has a rainbow been seen during your lifetime?” Rabbi Simeon asked, and Rabbi Joshua answered that a rainbow was seen. “Then you are not the son of Levi,” Rabbi Simeon said, “for your merit should have protected your generation so that no rainbow should be needed.” As a matter of fact no rainbow was seen during the lifetime of Rabbi Joshua, which was the best proof of his piety, but he refused to boast of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ע״ז ב׳.</span></i>
Another time Rabbi Joshua engaged in conversation with the angel of death and the latter instructed him to avoid three things in order to escape death. One of these was not to stop in front of women who return from a funeral, for the angel of death is then among them with his sword and he has permission to do harm.<sup class="footnote-marker">32)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות נ״א א׳.</span></i>
As was previously mentioned, Rabbi Joshua issued ordination without the consent of the Nasi. This was not a sign of opposition to the Nasi. He merely did not want to see Babylonia become a center of ordination, for it frequently happened that those who encountered difficulties in obtaining ordination in Palestine went to Babylonia to have themselves ordained. Rabbi Joshua therefore ruled that ordination obtained in foreign countries was not valid.<sup class="footnote-marker">33)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין י״ד א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Joshua taught his own children and he was accustomed to hear his grandson repeat the portion of the week every Friday. This custom he strictly adhered to and said: “He who hears his grandson read a chapter of the Torah is like one who heard the Torah from Mount Sinai.”<sup class="footnote-marker">34)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ל׳ א׳, ירושלמי שבת פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
Although Rabbi Joshua insisted that the Hagada should remain oral and declared that: “Only once have I read a book of Hagada and since then I am afraid of evil dreams,” Hagada nevertheless occupied a prominent place in his lectures and a great number of them were repeated in his name. He entrusted one of his disciples with the arrangement of the Hagadoth.<sup class="footnote-marker">35)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות י׳ א׳.</span></i> Tanchum ben Chanilai, another one of his disciples, was considered to be an authority in Hagada and was always consulted by Rabbi Chiya.<sup class="footnote-marker">36)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא נ״ד א׳.</span></i>
The Biblical passage stating that all the days of a poor man are evil, Rabbi Joshua interpreted to indicate that any person who lacked wisdom, who was angry or who was covetous could be considered poor. Covetousness Rabbi Joshua considered to be the worst human trait and he said that “whoever derives any benefit from a covetous person commits a sin, for king Solomon had commanded not to eat the bread of such a person.”<sup class="footnote-marker">37)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא קמ״ה ב׳.</span></i>
When the body of a slain person was found and it was not known who the slayer was, the Bible enjoined that the elders of the nearest city must slaughter a heifer and declare that their hands had not shed the blood of the slain man. This passage was questioned by Rabbi Joshua who said: “Could anyone suspect the elders of shedding the blood? What then did they have to declare? They had to declare that they had not seen the man or they would not have let him depart without food and without an escort.”<sup class="footnote-marker">38)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה ל״ה ב׳.</span></i>
“When the enemy came to destroy the temple,” Rabbi Joshua said, “it was surrounded by six hundred thousand angels who were prepared to defend it. But when they saw that the Shechinah was indifferent to what the enemy was doing they also departed.”<sup class="footnote-marker">39)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">דברים רבה פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא ט״ז.</span></i>
After the temple was destroyed God called his angels and said to them: “What does a mortal king do when his son dies?” and the angels replied: “He hangs a sack over his door.”
“Thus will I also do,” God answered, “I will cover the skies with darkness and a sack shall be its garment.”
Again God said to his angels: “What does a mortal king do when he mourns for his family?” and they replied: “He puts out all the lamps in his house.” “Thus will I also do,” God said, “the sun and the moon shall become dark and the stars shall lose their brightness.”<sup class="footnote-marker">40)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">איכה רבתי פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא א׳.</span></i>
God also says to the Jews: “You have caused me to destroy my house and to exile my children, you should therefore at least pray for the peace of Jerusalem and I will forgive your sins.”<sup class="footnote-marker">41)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מסכת דרך ארץ פרק השלום.</span></i>
“If the nations of the world knew,” Rabbi Joshua said, “that whenever Jews sin they are punished together with the Jews, they would assign two soldiers to every Jew to prevent him from sinning. Instead they even prevent Jews from observing the commandments. When Jews sin, the whole world is punished and when they refrain from sin the whole world is blessed for their sake.”<sup class="footnote-marker">42)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תנחומא פּרשת בחקותי.</span></i>
Another time Rabbi Joshua said: “Every prophet which the Jews had depended on the prophecy of others, with the exception of Moses. All prophecy which followed that of Moses was part of his. All the commandments which God gave on Mount Sinai were spoken to the Jews through the mouth of Moses with the exception of the first two which God pronounced himself.”<sup class="footnote-marker">43)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שמות רבה פּרשה מ״ב פּיסקא ז׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Joshua, who was on such “intimate” terms with the prophet Elijah and with the angel of death, once decided to visit Paradise and Gehenna. He spoke of this to the angel of death who was not at all pleased with this request. The angel of death complained to the then Nasi, Rabban Gamliel the Third, but Rabban Gamliel declared that Rabbi Joshua was right in his request and he commanded the angel of death to escort Rabbi Joshua. Rabban Gamliel also instructed the angel of death to request Rabbi Joshua to send a complete description of what he saw to the Nasi. The Nasi was particularly curious to know whether there were any Jews in Gehenna or any pagans in Paradise.
In his description what he saw, called “Massecheth Gan Eden,” Rabbi Joshua relates that he went throughout the length and breadth of Paradise which was divided into seven different parts. In one part of Paradise he found Elijah and the Messiah of the House of David, who asked him what the Jews were doing. Rabbi Joshua replied: “They are waiting for your coming,” whereupon Messiah wept bitterly and all the saints wept with him.
Rabbi Joshua further relates that he was not admitted into Gehenna, but was merely allowed to stand at the gate and to observe that which went on within.
“I have measured the area of Gehenna,” Rabbi Joshua wrote, “and I found it to be one hundred miles long and fifty miles wide. Fiery lions are stationed everywhere and whoever falls into Gehenna is devoured by these lions and is afterward recreated in his previous form. Later I measured a second part of Gehenna and I found it to be of the same dimensions as the first. I then asked: ‘For whom is the first part set aside?’ and I was informed that it was set apart for ten nations, and that among them was also Absalom, the son of king David, who rebelled against his father. One nation says to another: ‘We have sinned in not accepting the Torah; what have you done?’ and the other nation replies: ‘We have committed the same sin that you have committed.’ Then they all turn to Absalom and ask: ‘What was your sin?’ and Absalom replies: ‘I have sinned against my father.’”
“An angel then beats them all with fiery rods and the name of the angel is Kushiel. He throws them into fire until they are burned and then they come out in their previous form. Finally the angel is ready to chastise Absalom, but a Bath Kol announces: ‘Do not beat him, for he is descended from a people which promised at Mount Sinai to obey God’s commandments before they even knew what these commandments would be.’”
“After all the sinners are chastised and burned, they emerge from the fire as if nothing had happened. This occurs seven times during each day and three times during each night. Only Absalom is neither chastised nor burned and his punishment consists in observing the others’ chastisement.”
Of the second chamber of Gehenna Rabbi Joshua related the same as of the first. It also contained ten nations which were punished in the same manner as those in the first. Together with them was Doeg the Edomite who had been a guard of king Saul. The avenging angel was named Lahatiel and he did not chastise Doeg because of his Jewish descent. In the third chamber there were another ten nations and the name of the angel was Shaftiel. Korach and his congregation was found among these, but he also escaped chastisement and merely had to observe the punishment of the others.
The fourth chamber contained ten nations and Jerobeam ben Nebat. The punishing angel was Machtiel. Jerobeam escaped punishment because of his knowledge of the Torah and because of his descent. The fifth chamber was similar to the preceding ones and it contained Ahab, king of Israel. The name of the angel was Chutriel. The sixth chamber contained Micah who built the famous idol of Micah. He was punished together with the others by an angel named Pusiel. The seventh chamber also contained ten nations and Elisha ben Avuyah. The name of the angel was Dalkiel.
Of his visit in Paradise Rabbi Joshua also related the following:
“There are two gates of clear crystal and on top of each there stand six hundred thousand angels each of whose faces shines like the sky. When a saint enters they remove the garments in which he was buried and they dress him with eight new garments made out of clouds. Two crowns are then placed upon his head, one made out of precious stones and the other of pure gold; in addition they place eight strands of myrtle in his hands and they say to him: ‘Go eat your bread in gladness.’”
“He is then led to a place of rivers surrounded with flowers. A canopy of gold is erected and from the canopy there flow four rivers: one of oil, one of milk, one of wine and one of honey. Every canopy has a golden vine on top of it from which hang thirty pearls which shine like the morning star. To every canopy is attached a table laden with precious stones and pearls and sixty angels stand ready to serve every saint and they say to him: ‘Eat your honey and drink your wine, for it has been prepared for you since the six days of the creation.’ Even the least of the saints equals Rabbi Jochanan in beauty and is endowed with grace like that of Joseph.”
“There is no night in Paradise, and each day is divided into four parts. During the first part God comes to the children and plays with them as one would with children; during the second part God comes to the young men and plays with them as one would with young men; during the third part God comes to the middle aged men and plays with them as one would with middle aged people; during the fourth part of the day God comes to the aged and converses with them as one would with aged people.”
“There are eighty thousand trees in every corner of Paradise and the least of them is more beautiful than incense trees. There are also six hundred thousand angels in every corner and they all sing the praise of the Creator.”
“In the very center of Paradise there stands the Tree of Life whose branches cover all of Paradise. Its fruits have five hundred thousand tastes and each taste differs from all the others and each odor differs from all the others. Above the Tree of Life there float seven sacred clouds; breezes blow from all four sides through the leaves of the Tree of Life and its odors are wafted from one end of the world to the other.”
“The saints in Paradise are subdivided into seven groups. One group consists of martyrs such as Rabbi Akiba and his colleagues and disciples; the second group consists of those who were drowned for the sanctification of the name of God such as the four hundred young men and the four hundred maidens who jumped into the sea when the enemy wished to sell them to a life of shame; the third group consists of people like Rabbi Jochanan ben Zakkai and his colleagues; the fourth group consists of people whom the enemy wanted to defame after their death and a cloud descended and covered them; the fifth group is made up of penitents; the sixth group consists of young men who never sinned, and the seventh group includes modest people who suffered humiliation without replying in kind.”

Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani

A<small>FTER THE PERIOD OF THE BLOSSOMING OF LEARNING</small> in Palestine during the lifetime of Rabbi Jochanan and Resh Lakish a decline set in. This decline had been apparent for some time and was becoming more noticeable daily. A descendant of Hillel still occupied the office of Nasi and was thus the legal representative of the people. But the later N’siim were not noted for scholarly achievements and the veneration of the people toward them diminished. In time they lost all spiritual authority.
<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">The name Bar-Nachmani is used throughout the Babylonian Talmud (with one exception). The Jerusalem Talmud uses the name Bar-Nachman throughout, except on four occasions, where Bar-Nachmani is employed.</i>Rabbi Shmuel Bar-Nachmani was one of the spiritual leaders of the people during this period. He left few legal decisions, but he was one of the most prominent exponents of the Hagada. He repeated hundreds of Hagadic statements of previous “Amoraim” and his disciples quoted hundreds of his own interpretations. All questions pertaining to Hagada during his lifetime were always referred to him for clarification.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ויקרא רבה פּרשה ל״א פּיסקא א׳, איכה רבתי פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא מ״ג.</span></i>
Rabbi Shmuel Bar-Nachmani was born in Palestine and while still a child his grandfather often carried him on his shoulders through Beth Shean on his way to Kefar Chanan that he should see the scholars at study and that he should absorb the sound of their voices. This took place during the last days of Rabbi Jehudah haNasi and it was then an accepted belief that a child which looked at Rabbi Jehudah or was in his presence for a few minutes was certain to become a scholar.
Another legend related that Rabbi Shmuel was born in Babylonia and only came to Palestine to ask of Rabbi Jonathan the meaning of three verses in the Bible concerning which he was in doubt. But this apparent contradiction may be explained by the fact that Rabbi Shmuel spent his youth in Babylonia, where favorable circumstances prevailed, and that he later returned to Palestine. Rabbi Shmuel visited Babylonia a number of times at the request of the High Court of Palestine in order to determine “leap years” when that could not be done in Palestine. On one of these trips he spent a night in the house of Rabbi Jacob the Miller. That night Rabbi Zeira hid among the barrels in the house in order to hear Rabbi Shmuel recite the “Shema” and he later told that Rabbi Shmuel repeated the Shema many times until he was overcome by sleep.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> Rabbi Shmuel is also known to have been sent, together with his mother, to intercede with queen Zenobia for the life of a political offender.
Rabbi Shmuel Bar-Nachmani lived for more than one hundred years and the time of his influence extended from the days of Rabbi Jonathan, whose pupil he had been, until the rule of Rabbi Jehudah N’siah the Second. It appears that the Nasi did not approve of Rabbi Shmuel and when he once asked him the interpretation of the expression “by his name Jah” (Psalms, 68:4), he was dissatisfied with the reply and remarked: “It is regrettable that those scholars who could interpret this passage better are already dead.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה י״ב פּיסקא ט׳.</span></i>
At that time there broke out a famine and an epidemic and the people were at a loss for the deliverance of which of the calamities they were to pray. Rabbi Shmuel advised them to pray for the cessation of the famine, for “when God will give us food, He will also grant us life during which to enjoy the food.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית ח׳ ב׳.</span></i>. He also instructed that teachers should dismiss their pupil from eleven o’clock in the morning until three in the afternoon during the time between the seventeenth day of Tamuz and the ninth day of Ab, for this was a difficult period for the pupils who might lose their health from too great effort.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">איכה רבתי פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא ל׳.</span></i>
When Rabbi Shmuel grew old and realized that the Nasi did not regard him favorably he but rarely attended the academy. During one of his infrequent visits he found the scholars debating the request of a man to annul an excommunication which was imposed upon him by Rabbi Jehudah ben Ezekiel. Since R. Jehudah was dead at that time the scholars were inclined to consider favorably the petition of the man. But Rabbi Shmuel said: “The maidservant of Rabbi Jehudah haNasi once banned a man who had beaten his grown up son and the scholars honored her decision; would you revoke the excommunication of our comrade Rabbi Jehudah?” His opinion was then accepted and the ban was not lifted.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן י״ז א׳.</span></i>
The following are characteristic expressions of Rabbi Shmuel:
“Everything in the world was created by God, except falsehood which is an outgrowth of human imagination.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסיקתא רבתי פּ׳ כ״ד.</span></i>
After completing the creation of the world God saw everything that He had made and “it was very good.” Rabbi Shmuel declared that “very good” referred to man’s evil desires, for if it were not for these no man would build a house, nor marry a wife, nor beget children, nor engage in commerce.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ה׳ פּיסקא ט׳, קהלת רבה פּרשה ג׳ פּיסקא ט״ז.</span></i>
Rabbi Shmuel devoted himself to classifying the prayers. One must pray thrice daily, he said, to conform with the three changes which occur every day. In the morning one should say: “I thank Thee my God and God of my fathers for bringing me out of darkness into light.” In the afternoon one should say: “May it be Thy will to permit me to see the sun in the West even as You allowed me to see it in the East.” At night one should pray: “May it be Thy will to lead me out of darkness into the light even as You had led me out of darkness into light before.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ד׳ הלכה א׳, בראשית רבה ס״ה י״א.</span></i>
Rabbi Shmuel lived during the last years of the third century C.E., when the Christians began the attempt to postpone the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday. Rabbi Shmuel opposed this effort with all his might and he warned the Jews against assuming that the Sabbath could be postponed to another day. “Why did God bless the Sabbath?” he said, “because it may never be postponed to another day. Holidays and even the Day of Atonement may be postponed, when a leap year is declared, but not the Sabbath.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה י״א פּיסקא ט׳.</span></i><sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">As long as the Jewish calendar was not definitely determined, it was the duty of the High Court to determine the holidays as they saw fit and even the Day of Atonement could be postponed, it has proved as when Rabbi Simeon b. Gamliel the First commanded Rabbi Joshua ben Chananiah to appear before him bearing his cane and his wallet on the day that he considered to be the Day of Atonement.</i>
Some of the Amoraim believed that Sabbaths and holidays were to be devoted to the study of the Torah solely, while others allowed half of these days to be utilized for personal enjoyment.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים ס״ח ב׳.</span></i> But Rabbi Shmuel declared that the Sabbath should be devoted to food and drink and that only in order to avoid idle talk was it allowed also to engage in study on that day.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שבת פרק ט״ו הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
The verse “Many waters cannot quench love” (Song of Songs, 8:7) Rabbi Shmuel interpreted in the following manner: Two kinds of love are referred to, the love of God for Israel which is so great that were all the nations of the world to try to thwart it, they could not do so, and the love of Israel for the Torah. Were all the nations to say: “We will sell all our possessions in order to observe the Torah and its commandments,” God would reply to them: “Even if you were to sell all your possessions to obtain the Torah, you would only be ridiculed.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">במדבר רבה פּרשה ב׳ פּיסקא ט״ז.</span></i>
The destruction of the Temple played an important role in the mode of thought of Rabbi Shmuel. Nearly two centuries had already elapsed since the destruction and none thought about sacrifices any longer. Many of the scholars of the time disapproved of sacrifices or had ignored the matter. The express commandments of the Torah to offer sacrifices, they easily refuted with passages from the Prophets such as the statement of Jeremiah that “I spoke not unto your fathers nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices” (7:22). But the Temple remained a symbol of the liberation of the people and it was always mentioned with the hope of its speedy restoration and the renewal of the service as in days of old. It is also interesting to note that the people feared to speak of the second temple and they therefore always referred to the first temple. They spoke of Babylonians, but meant the Romans, they referred to Nebusaradon or Nebuchadnezzar, but really meant Titus or the reigning emperor.
Like other scholars Rabbi Shmuel also spoke of the destruction of the Temple in his lectures. Many such lectures are included in the introduction to “Midrash Eicha Rabathi” and these describe how Jeremiah went to the graves of the Patriarchs and begged them to intercede with God. It was characteristic of the times that the belief was commonly held that Rachel rose from her grave and wept at the fate of her children. Her weeping aroused pity in heaven and she was assured that they would soon be redeemed from the land of the enemy. (Jeremiah, 31:14.) Such descriptions delivered by good orators profoundly impressed the people.
“After the Temple was destroyed,” Rabbi Shmuel said, “Abraham came to the throne of glory; he was weeping and tearing his hair; his garments were torn and he was covered with ashes. Thus he went about and called upon God: ‘Am I worse than other fathers that I should suffer such shame?’”
“When the Angels saw Abraham they also wept and when God asked them why they wept, they said: ‘The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth, he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.’” (Isaiah, 33:8.)
“God thereupon answered and said: ‘Since my friend Abraham has left the world, he has not come to see the welfare of my house, Why then does he come now?’ and Abraham replied: ‘Why have you exiled my children and handed them over to barbaric peoples who slay them with numerous kinds of deaths? Why have you allowed the Temple, the place where I offered my son for the sake of Thy great name, to be destroyed?’”
“ ‘Your children have sinned,’ God replied to Abraham, ‘they have not observed the commandments of my Torah and they transgressed against the 22 sacred letters of the Torah.’”
“ ‘Who will bear witness against my children that they have not observed the commandments, or that they transgressed against its 22 sacred letters?’ Abraham asked.”
“ ‘The Torah is the best witness,’ God replied.”
“The Torah then came out and was ready to testify against the Jews, but Abraham said: ‘Daughter, you wish to testify against the Jews that they did not observe your commandments? Are you not ashamed of such testimony? Do you not remember the day, when God carried you among all the nations and they refused to accept you until my children came to Mount Sinai and they accepted you with honor? Will you now testify against them in the hour of their affliction?’”
“When the Torah heard this, it stepped aside and God called upon the 22 letters to come and testify. The first of these was ‘Aleph’ and Abraham said to it: “You, who are the first letter of the Alphabet, come to testify against my children? When God appeared on Mount Sinai and offered the ten commandments which begin with an Aleph, no people would accept you until my children did; would you now testify against them?’”
“In shame the Aleph stepped aside and the Beth came up to testify. To it Abraham said: ‘You would testify against my children, who accepted the Pentateuch which begins with a Beth?’ In shame the Beth stepped aside and the Gimel came forward, and Abraham addressed it: ‘God’s commandment <span dir="rtl">״גדילים״</span> (Deutr. 22, 12), which begins with a Gimel, was rejected by all nations until my children accepted it; would you testify against them?’ After the Gimel appeared the Daled and again Abraham said: ‘Will you testify against my children? When God told Moses, Speak to the children of Israel, which begins with a Daled—did they not heed him?’”
“In shame the Daled also stepped aside and when the other letters saw that Abraham shamed them, they refused to testify against the Jews. Then Abraham said: ‘Lord of the world! When I was 100 years old, you gave me a son and when he reached the age of 37 you commanded me to offer him to you as a sacrifice. I then hardened my heart and I showed no mercy to him in order to fulfill your wish. Now you have forgotten all that and you showed no mercy toward my children.’”
“After these words Moses came and he said to God: ‘Lord of the world! Have I not been like a good shepherd to your people? Like a horse I ran before them in the desert, but when the time came to enter the Land of Israel you decreed that I should die in the desert. Now I am called to mourn over their affliction.’ Then Moses said to Jeremiah: ‘Proceed, and I will go with you, for I wish to see who will dare do harm to the Jews.’ But Jeremiah replied: ‘I cannot go, for the road is covered with corpses and I am a Priest.’ Moses then said to him: ‘Come, for I have commanded you.’”
“Moses and Jeremiah came to the rivers of Babylon and when the Jews saw Moses, they exclaimed: ‘The son of Amram has risen from his grave to redeem us from our enemies.’ But a Bath-Kol was heard to declare: ‘It is a decree which cannot be changed.’”
“Then Moses said to the people: ‘My dear children, I cannot redeem you; I can only pray to God that he should soon return you to your land.’”
“When the Jews heard these words, they wept bitterly and the sound of their weeping shook the seven heavens The angels, the sun, the moon and the stars wept with them.”
“Moses returned to the Patriarchs to tell them of what the enemy had done to their children and he said: ‘Some of them are killed and some had their arms broken and bound behind their backs, some were burdened with heavy chains and were driven naked over mountains and valleys, while others died on the way and their bodies were left to be devoured by birds and beasts of prey. Still others were left on the sands of the desert with their eyes gouged out to await their death.’”
“When they heard this, the Patriarchs wept and mourned: ‘Woe, what has befallen our orphans that hungry and naked they must wander in the lands of their enemies, woe that they must climb high mountains and must wound their feet on rocks and boulders, woe that they must carry heavy sacks of sand on their delicate backs, woe that their arms have been broken and their eyes gouged, woe that their throats are parched with thirst, woe that God could witness the slaughter of children before the eyes of their mothers and the death of mothers before the eyes of their children.’”
“Moses then turned to the Sun and said: ‘Be cursed, Sun, that you were not darkened when the enemies entered the Temple!’ and the Sun replied: ‘I swear to you, Moses, by the name of the Eternal One, that I wanted to hide among the clouds in order not to light the way of the enemy, but I was beaten with fiery rods and I was commanded to do my duty.’”
“Then Rachel came weeping bitterly and when the sound of her weeping was heard a voice from heaven announced: ‘Cease weeping, for your children will soon return from the land of their enemies to their own home.’”

Rabbi Simlai bar Aba

L<small>IKE</small> R<small>ABBI</small> S<small>HMUEL BAR</small> N<small>ACHMANI</small>, Rabbi Simlai was also a master of Hagadic interpretation. Hundreds of these are quoted in the Babylonian Talmud in his name, but the Jerusalem Talmud contains only one Hagadic quotation from Rabbi Simlai.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּאה פרק ה׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Simlai was born in Babylonia in the city of Nehardea. The exact location of this city is unknown aside from the fact that it was situated on the river Malka, somewhere between the Tigris and the Euphrates. It is also known that Jews began to settle in that city several decades after the destruction of the Temple. Various horrifying stories were at first told about Nehardea, but later it became known as the seat of prominent academies which rivalled those in Jabneh and Tiberias.
Rabbi Simlai’s father was always referred to as “Aba, the father of Rabbi Simlai.” However, he was a significant man in his own right and it was related that he once asked Shmuel Yarchinai, the mathematician of the Talmud, a question pertaining to the determination of “leap years” which the latter could not answer despite the fact that he had boasted that he could calculate the beginning of each month without recourse to the testimony of witnesses who had seen the new moon. On this occasion the father of Rabbi Simlai is said to have remarked: “If you cannot answer this question, then it is entirely possible that there are other matters which you do not know.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה כ׳ ב׳.</span></i>
When Rabbi Simlai arrived in Palestine he settled in Lud, but later he moved to Galilee where he spent most of the time in the city of the residence of the Nasi. Rabbi Jehudah N’siah the First was Nasi at the time of his arrival. The following conversation is said to have taken place between the two, as the Nasi once leaned on the shoulder of Rabbi Simlai during a stroll: “Yesterday you were absent from the academy when we permitted the use of oil bought from Gentiles,” the Nasi said and Rabbi Simlai replied: “I will yet live to see the day when you will permit the use of Gentile bread.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה ל״ז א׳.</span></i>
This new regulation was announced in Babylonia by a pupil of Rabbi Simlai, although it is also possible that Rabbi Simlai himself was delegated by the Nasi to announce the new regulation.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי עבודה זרה פרק ב׳ הלכה ט׳.</span></i>
In later life Rabbi Simlai served Rabbi Jannai the Old<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא קי״א א׳.</span></i> and he was also a close friend of Rabbi Jehudah N’siah the Second.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בכורות ל״ו ב׳.</span></i>
His debates with the “Minim” (Christian Jews), who annoyed him with various questions, are interesting. Since the Hebrew word “Elohim” (God) is in the plural form, the Minim asked him, how many gods shared in the creation of the world. Rabbi Simlai replied that the further text amply answered their question; thus the Bible says: “Let us make man in our image” (in the plural) and this is followed by “God created man in his own image” (in the singular). When his pupils said that it was easy to give such an answer to the “Minim,” but that they were not satisfied with it, he replied that the plural was used, because Adam was created out of earth and Eve out of Adam’s rib, but in the future no increase could be had by man without woman or by woman without man, and both need the assistance of God.
Another time the “Minim” asked him why the phrase “Elohim Kedoshim” (holy gods, in the plural) was employed in the Bible, and Rabbi Simlai replied that the subsequent phrase “Elohim Hu” (He is God) was a sufficient answer. To his pupils he explained that the plural was used to indicate that God was holy with all kinds of holiness.
The number of commandments in the Torah is 613 and whoever transgresses even against one commandment is considered to have broken all of them. The Prophets sought to diminish the number of commandments and Hillel tried to express the essence of the Torah in one phrase: “Do not unto others what you would not have done unto you.”
Rabbi Simlai said: “The 613 commandments consist of 365 negative ones, equal to the number of days in the year, and of 248 positive commandments, equal to the number of limbs in the human body.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכות כ״ג ב׳.</span></i> One of Rabbi Simlai’s pupils amplified this statement and said: “The number of positive commandments is equal to the number of limbs in a human body, because every limb implores man to commit a good deed. The number of negative commandments is equal to the number of days in the year, according to the reckoning of the sun, because each day implores man not to commit a sin during its time.
Another general statement of Rabbi Simlai declared: “The Torah begins with an act of kindness and ends with an act of kindness. When Adam and Eve realized their nakedness and were ashamed, God made them coats of skins. When Moses died on Mount Nebo and no one was with him to bury him, God buried Moses.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה י״ד א׳.</span></i> Later Rabbi Simlai somewhat changed his interpretation and said: “One who would realize the kindness of God should consult the Torah and he will see that the first act of God was to adorn Eve as one adorns a bride when he led her before Adam. God adorns all brides as he adorned Eve; He visits the sick as He visited Abraham; He buries the dead as He buried Moses.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מדרש תנחומא פּ׳ וירא.</span></i>
“The Bible says: “Remember the day of Sabbath to consecrate it” and also “Observe the day of Sabbath.” Rabbi Simlai explained that one should remember the Sabbath before it comes and he should observe it after it had come. How can this be done? Every time one sees a good object or a new vessel, he should reserve it for the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסיקתא רבתי פּרשה כ״ג.</span></i>
Economic conditions in Palestine were very poor at that time and the population was so impoverished that no one possessed good garments. As Rabbi Simlai once explained the commandment to prepare special garments for Sabbath, the people wept, for they could not afford such a luxury. Rabbi Simlai then said: “If one does not have a good garment to wear on Saturday, he should at least wear a different garment; even though it be torn it should be different from the one worn on week days.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי פּאה פרק ה׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>
“When Messiah will come,” Rabbi Simlai said, “God will take a book of the Torah in his arms and He will say: ‘Whoever devoted himself to the study of the Torah, let him come and receive his reward.’ All the nations will then come together, but God will say to them, ‘Let each nation come separately.’”
“The first to come before God will be Edom (Rome) and He will ask them: ‘What have you done in the world?’ and they will reply: ‘We paved highways; we built many bath houses; we gathered much silver and gold. All this we did for the sake of Your Jews that they might devote themselves to the Torah.’ God will then answer them: ‘Fools that you are. All that you did, you did for yourself. You paved streets that you might settle your harlots there; you built bath houses that you might anoint your bodies; you gathered gold and silver which belongs to me. But you did not study the Torah and you will receive no reward.’ The sons of Edom will then leave with bowed heads.”
“After them will come the Persians and God will ask them: ‘What have you done?’ and they will reply: “We have built many bridges; we have conquered many cities; we have waged many wars. All this we did for the sake of the Jews, that they might have time to devote themselves to the Torah.’ To them God will say: ‘All that you did, you did for yourself. You built bridges to collect tolls; you conquered cities to collect taxes; your wars I waged for you, but you did not study the Torah, then why do you seek reward?’”
“But the Persians will refuse to leave empty handed and they will say: ‘Have you offered the Torah to us and we have rejected it?’ and God will reply: ‘Seven commandments I gave to the sons of Noah and you have not observed them.’ The Persians will ask further: ‘Have the Jews observed the seven commandments?’”
“ ‘I will call your own witnesses,’ God will answer, ‘and you shall see that they have observed my commandments. Let Nimrod testify concerning Abraham that he did not worship idols; let Laban testify that he did not suspect Jacob of robbery; let Potiphar’s wife testify that Joseph was not persuaded to sin; let Nebuchadnezzar testify concerning Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, that they refused to bow before an idol; let Darius testify concerning Daniel that he refused to interrupt his prayer.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה ב׳ וג׳.</span></i>

Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath

R<small>ABBI</small> E<small>LAZAR BEN</small> P<small>EDATH</small> occupied a prominent place among those who came to Palestine from Babylonia during the second and third generations of the “Amoraim”. He is very seldom referred to by his patronymic and nothing is known of the position of his father in Jewish life.
Although he was not ordained, when he arrived in Palestine, he was then well versed in learning.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות קי״ב א׳.</span></i> While still in Babylonia he was a pupil of Rav (Aba Arecha), whose legal opinions he later quoted.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קנ״ג א׳, ערובין ס״ה ב׳, ירושלמי פּסחים פרק ד׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i> Later he was a disciple of Rabbi Chanina bar Chama and scores of statements in the Talmud begin with the words: “Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Chanina.”
Rabbi Elazar always named the authors of the opinions which he quoted even when these were commonly known as in the case of the statement which declared that: “He who repeats a word in the name of its authors brings redemption to the world.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה ט״ו א׳.</span></i> It is therefore incomprehensible that Rabbi Jochanan complained about Rabbi Elazar that he appropriated statements of others.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ב׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> This attitude of reverence toward authorship also caused a dispute between Rabbi Elazar and Resh Lakish, when he heard the latter state a law which he had previously heard from Rabbi Jochanan.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכות ה׳ בי.</span></i> In the popular mind Rabbi Elazar was considered to be a disciple of Rabbi Jochanan, although he denied it, and when a colleague of his referred to “your master R. Jochanan” he remarked: “not my master nor our master.” We also find an instance in the Talmud that Rabbi Jochanan complained against Rabbi Elazar for not greeting him.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שקלים פרק ב׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>
We may assume that a personal misunderstanding existed between Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Jochanan, although no specific mention of it is made anywhere in the Talmud. But we do find reference to an attempt by Rabbi Jochanan to discuss the “mysteries of the chariot” with Rabbi Elazar which the latter turned down on the grounds of being “too young to discuss this matter.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה י״ג א׳.</span></i> Another time Rabbi Jochanan exclaimed: “It is a pleasure to observe Ben Pedath while lecturing. It seems as if Moses is expounding that which he heard from the mouth of God.” But to this Resh Lakish remarked: “He does not speak his own words. He merely repeats what he read in a Boraitha.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ע״ב ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Elazar earned his livelihood from testing coins.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא ק׳ א׳.</span></i> This occupation provided him with an insufficient income and he lived in great want. Once, after he bled himself and there was not a crust of bread in his house, he ate a piece of garlic for want of something better and fainted. While swooning he asked God how much longer he would have to suffer want, but God replied: “Would you have me upset the world in order that you might be born in a more lucky hour?”<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ט״ז ב׳.</span></i>
From the original statements of Rabbi Elazar in the Talmud we gather that he was gifted with noble qualities. Thus he declared that “humility adds to one’s life.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין י״ד א׳.</span></i> In his personal life he was always humble and he never prided himself on his learning before others.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא קכ״ח ב׳.</span></i> His love for the Torah was indescribable<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין נ״ד ב׳.</span></i> and he often said: “Just as a child must be nursed by its mother every hour during the day even so should every man devote each hour of the day to the Torah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ט׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>
The great poverty of Rabbi Elazar was well known to the Nasi who sometimes sent him gifts to alleviate his need, but Rabbi Elazar always refused to accept these. When he was invited to attend a feast at the house of the Nasi he also refused to attend.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה כ״ה א׳.</span></i>
“Charity,” Rabbi Elazar said, “atones for all sins and is more important than sacrifices.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15a)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">15א) סוכה מ״ט ב׳.</span></i> “It may be compared to armor; just as armor is made up of small pieces, in charity one adds penny to penny until there is formed a considerable sum.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא ט׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Great trust was therefore placed in Rabbi Elazar and he was entrusted with the feeding of the poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ס״ח א׳, ירושלמי פּאה פרק ה׳ הלכה ח׳.</span></i> It was then observed that in distributing charity, he sought to make the recipients feel as if they were not receiving charity. When Rabbi Elazar was made head of the distribution of charity he also had to collect taxes from the Jews. He then asked Rabbi Jochanan whether taxes should be levied according to wealth or according to the number of persons in a family. Rabbi Jochanan replied that taxes should be levied according to one’s wealth.<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא ז׳ ב׳.</span></i>
His hatred of charity was so great that Rabbi Elazar said: “When Noah sent out a dove to see whether the waters of the flood had receded, it returned with an olive leaf in its beak. By this it implied that food bitter as an olive leaf obtained from the hand of God, is to be preferred to food sweet as honey which is obtained at the hand of man.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ק״ח ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Elazar was not the only needy scholar at that time. Due to the difficult economic circumstances there were many such. Among these was also Rabbi Simeon bar Aba. It was related that Rabbi Elazar once lost a ducat which was found by Rabbi Simeon, but he refused to take it back declaring that he had already given up the search for it.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי בבא מציעא פרק ב׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
Following the death of Rabbi Jochanan, Rabbi Elazar was elected representative of the academy and since that time the Babylonians began to call him “The lord of the Land of Israel.”<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא ב׳ ב׳, גטין י״ט ב׳, נדה כ׳ ב׳.</span></i>
We have previously mentioned that the Babylonians were not held in high repute in Palestine and they therefore prided themselves on their countryman Rabbi Elazar. Since he was everywhere recognized as an authority, they appealed to him in all matters and he instructed them in all problems of things which are prohibited or permissible and also in money matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ביצה ד׳ ב׳, גטין ע״ג א׳, ירושלמי קדושין פרק א׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>
In his teachings Rabbi Elazar followed logical reason in his attempts to find the correct interpretations and to explain apparent contradictions. He did not fear to differ from the interpretations of others and his opinions were at times even contrary to the obvious meaning of the Mishna.<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי תרומות פרק א׳ הלכה בי, שקלים פרק א׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i> When he sought to establish the original intentions of various laws, he set up rules which were later accepted by other scholars. These rules included the following: “One must not add to a biblical decree or to its structure.”<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שביעית פרק ב׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i> “One may not declare an unclean thing to be clean nor a clean object to be unclean.”<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי תרומות פרק ה׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i> “Everything which derives its importance from certain circumstances loses its importance when these circumstances cease to exist.”<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי יבמות פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
As soon as Rabbi Elazar came to Palestine, he established close relations with the scholars of that time. He particularly respected Rabbi Chiya whose opinions served as his guide,<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי יבמות פרק ב׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i> and it was accepted that the opinions of the two would always coincide.<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי קדושין פרק א׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Elazar expressed his love for Palestine in the following statements: “He who lives in Palestine, is without sin,”<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ל״ב א׳.</span></i> and “Happy are they who live in Palestine, for they have no sins either in life or in death.”<sup class="footnote-marker">30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מדרש משלי פּרשה י״ז.</span></i>
Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath instructed the Babylonian Jews to observe strictly all holidays for the duration of two days, as it was the law at the Diaspora.<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ביצה ד׳ ב׳.</span></i> The problem of the second day of a holiday was then an important matter for the Jews of Babylonia. This custom of celebrating an extra day was introduced during the time when messengers of the Palestine High Court could not be sent to inform the Babylonians of the beginning of a new month. Although the Babylonian Jews could have determined the new months themselves, because they also followed the lunar calendar, the Exilarch nevertheless added an extra day to all holidays for fear that his calculations might differ from those of the High Court in Palestine. But at times the Romans relaxed their vigilance and the messengers were free to announce the findings of the High Court, at such times the Babylonian Jews would ignore the extra added day. It was for this reason that Rabbi Elazar instructed all Jews who lived outside of Palestine to observe the second day of the holidays.
On another occasion he sent the following message to Babylonia: “Attend to the cleanliness of your bodies; strive to study in company and be careful in your treatment of poor children, for only from them the Torah will issue.”<sup class="footnote-marker">32)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדרים פּ״א א׳.</span></i>
Little is known of the achievements of Rabbi Elazar as head of the academy at Tiberias. We do know that, aside from the few Halachoth in the formulation of which he participated, he was one of the outstanding exponents of Hagada. His Hagadic statements were of such deep significance that their value remained permanent and it was also unimportant what biblical text he based them on, for he used the texts merely to bring out his ideas.
Thus he declared that one who returns from a journey must rest for three days before he can keep his mind on his prayers. He proved this by the fact that when Ezra came to the river Ahavah, on the way to Palestine, he rested for three days before he declared a fast and prayed to God to guide his steps. When he arrived in Jerusalem he also waited for three days before he commenced his work.<sup class="footnote-marker">33)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין ס״ה א׳.</span></i>
The statement of Hannah to Eli (Sam. I., 1:16), “Esteem not thy handmaid as a daughter of Belial,” he compared to the “Bnei Belial” mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, and he concluded that “the prayer of a drunken man may be compared to idol worshipping”<sup class="footnote-marker">34)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ל״א א׳.</span></i> Another example of his method of interpretation is found in his declaration that there can be no other punishment for a man who lifts his hand against neighbor except being buried. This he based on the verse that the earth belonged to men of strong arms.<sup class="footnote-marker">35)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין נ״ח ב׳.</span></i>
Of charity Rabbi Elazar said: “As long as the Temple existed, a man could give a shekel for a sacrifice and his sins were forgiven; but now that the Temple is destroyed, it is best that one should give for charity, for if he will not give charity to Jews, pagans will take his possessions by force.”<sup class="footnote-marker">36)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא ט׳ א׳.</span></i> On another occasion he similarly declared that “if a poor man requires aid, it should be given to him even on the Sabbath.”<sup class="footnote-marker">37)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ה׳ א׳.</span></i>
Of those who sought to obtain charity when they did not need it, Rabbi Elazar said: “We should be thankful to these, for were it not for these swindlers, any man who refused to give charity when asked, would be punished at once. As it is, such a person can claim that he suspected the applicant for charity of being a swindler.”<sup class="footnote-marker">38)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי פּאה פרק ח׳ הלכה ט׳.</span></i>
“Why did God create human fingers in their present shape?” Rabbi Elazar asked. “It was done in order that a man might plug his ears when he hears improper words,” Rabbi Elazar himself explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">39)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ה׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Speaking of God’s consideration for human weaknesses, Rabbi Elazar said: “If a man insults his neighbor and later wishes to conciliate him, the insulted man may demand a retraction in the presence of those people who witnessed the insult. But when a man sins against God in public, he may repent in private.”<sup class="footnote-marker">40)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא פּ״ו ב׳.</span></i>
At times Rabbi Elazar discussed the evil nature of man and he said: “He who ridicules others will be punished with suffering,”<sup class="footnote-marker">41)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה י״ח ב׳.</span></i> and “he who is arrogant toward others, deserves to be cut down like a tree, for he causes the Shechinah to sorrow and in the end he will be as low as dust.”<sup class="footnote-marker">42)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה ה׳ א׳.</span></i>
More than arrogance Rabbi Elazar despised flattery and he said: “A flatterer brings down the anger of God upon the world. Even children in their mother’s womb curse him and he is doomed to Gehenna. He who flatters a wicked man, will be delivered into his hand, if he escapes his hand, he is sure to be delivered into the hands of the children or the grandchildren of the wicked man.”<sup class="footnote-marker">43)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה מ״א ב׳.</span></i> “If a whole congregation is afflicted with flattery,” he added, “it may be compared to an unclean woman and in the end it will be exiled.”<sup class="footnote-marker">44)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה מ״ב א׳.</span></i>
“He who departs from his word is like an idol worshipper,”<sup class="footnote-marker">45)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין צ״ו א׳.</span></i> and “one who deceives with words, is worse than one who deceives with money.”<sup class="footnote-marker">46)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא נ״ח א׳.</span></i>
“A man who owns no land may not be considered a man, for the Bible said, ‘The earth He gave to the people.’” All artisans will in the end return to the soil despite the fact that there is no ruder work than tilling the soil. But although tilling the soil is of great importance, the position of the merchants is much more favorable.<sup class="footnote-marker">47)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ס״ג א׳.</span></i>
“Working for one’s livelihood,” Rabbi Elazar said, “may be compared to working for the redemption. Just as redemption will be achieved through miracles, even so does one gain his livelihood miraculously, and just as one has to earn his livelihood daily, even so may he expect redemption daily.”<sup class="footnote-marker">48)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ב׳ פּיסקא כ״ב.</span></i>
Rabbi Elazar had a high opinion of married life and he said: “One who is not married may not be considered a man. Thus we find that God named man after He had created both male and female.”<sup class="footnote-marker">49)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ס״ג א׳.</span></i>
Speaking of human intelligence he said: “A man without intelligence deserves no pity, and he who gives his bread to a fool will suffer in the end and will be driven out of his home.”<sup class="footnote-marker">50)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין צ״ב א׳.</span></i>

Rabbi Avahu of Caesaria

A<small>T THAT TIME</small> C<small>HRISTIANITY BEGAN</small> to spread throughout Palestine as a result of the encouragement which it received from the Roman officials who were inclined to favor it more than they favored the Jewish teachings under the direct protection of the government. Those who steadfastly clung to the Jewish faith found themselves persecuted by their own brothers as well as by the government.
Rabbi Avahu of Caesarea lived during this period. He was known for his great beauty which was said to have resembled the beauty of the patriarch Jacob. (According to Jewish tradition Jacob was the handsomest man of his generation and his image was engraved on God’s “throne of honor.”) In addition he was reputed to possess great physical strength, equal to the strength of Jacob who, upon his arrival in Haran, alone removed the stone from the mouth of the well; a feat which ordinarily required the combined efforts of all the shepherds. Thus it was related of Rabbi Avahu that when the roof of the bath house, where he found himself at the moment, caved in, he supported it with his hands until assistance came and thus saved the lives of 101 people that were within the building from certain death.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ס׳ א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Avahu was born in Caesarea and in that city he lived all his life and conducted an academy. He traded in women’s adornments and was very wealthy.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי בבא מציעא פרק ד׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i> Because of this he was respected by the Roman officials whom he often presented with gifts. He led the life of an aristocrat: his house was furnished with ivory chairs, and it was said that each Saturday night he had a fatted calf slaughtered and of this he ate only the kidneys.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ט א׳.</span></i> Rabbi Avahu was versed in the secular sciences and foreign languages and this contributed to his popularity in government circles. It was thus related that whenever he visited the governor, he was met with a special greeting which praised him in the following words: “Behold the greatest among his people, the leader of his nation, the shining light. Blessed be his coming in peace.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות י״ז א׳.</span></i>
But despite Rabbi Avahu’s wealth and honor he was not proud and he shared his honors with other people.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה י״ד א׳.</span></i> He was often compelled to debate with Gentiles and he invariably emerged victorious.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוכה מ״ח ב׳, סנהדרין ל״ט א׳.</span></i> During one of these debates he nearly lost his life when one, Jacob Minaa, gave him a poisonous liquid to drink; he was then saved by his colleagues, Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi. These debates forced Rabbi Avahu to study the Scriptures minutely until he became a great authority on the Bible.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה כ״ח א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Avahu began his studies with Rabbi Jochanan and from him he learned most of the Torah. In later life he remarked: “Rabbi Jochanan opened a door for me and he allowed the light to shine upon me.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי פּסחים פרק ב׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i> Rabbi Jochanan also used to mention the name of Rabbi Avahu with affection and he called him “my child.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין מ״ד ב׳.</span></i> Rabbi Avahu also studied with Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath. He quoted his master in the Babylonian Talmud twenty times and in the Jerusalem Talmud there are about fifty such quotations in addition to those in the Midrashim. It appears that he also studied with Resh Lakish, but his relations with the latter were more those of friendship than the relations of a pupil with his teacher. Both often went to spread knowledge of the Torah in cities where that was needed. As they were once approaching such a city, Rabbi Avahu remarked: “Why should we go into a city of wicked men where we shall certainly be humiliated?” Resh Lakish then descended from the ass upon which he was riding and taking a handful of earth, he stuffed it into the mouth of Rabbi Avahu and said: “God does not want that evil should be spoken of Jews.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שיר השירים רבה פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא ל״ט.</span></i> Other statements quoted by Rabbi Avahu in the Talmud indicate that he also learned from other scholars.
After the death of Rabbi Jochanan, his followers wanted to choose Rabbi Avahu as head of the academy, but he refused this honor saying that Rabbi Aba of Acco was better fitted for the post. Rabbi Avahu therefore remained in Caesarea where he continued to head his own academy and he interceded for his people with the authorities whenever necessary. When other scholars were forbidden to visit the cities for educational purposes, Rabbi Avahu was exempted from this restriction. In these travels he even reached Alexandria.
The wife of Rabbi Aba of Acco once remarked to the wife of Rabbi Avahu that her husband was the equal of Rabbi Avahu in learning and that he showed respect to him merely because the latter was rich. The woman repeated this remark to her husband, but Rabbi Avahu said: “It does not matter whether Rabbi Aba needs my learning or not, both he and I praise God.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה מ׳ א׳.</span></i>
The following incident was also characteristic of the modesty of Rabbi Avahu: When the land was once affected by a drought, the people sought for someone whose prayer for rain should be acceptable in the eyes of God. Rabbi Avahu was then informed in a dream that a certain man named Pentakake was the right man to offer the prayer. The man was thereupon summoned and when he was asked what his trade was, he said that he was a white slave dealer. Rabbi Avahu was curious to know what good deeds such a man could have done that he should be worthy to have his prayers acceptable before God. The man told him that a woman once came to him and offered her body for a sum of money with which to redeem her husband from prison where he was incarcerated through no fault of his. The man pitied the woman and gave her all the money that he possessed and when that sum was not enough he sold his belongings to aid the woman free her husband. When Rabbi Avahu heard this story he said: “If this is so then you are the worthiest man to pray for rain.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי תענית פרק א׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jehudah N’siah the Second was Nasi at that time. The Nasi resided at Sephoris and even though the government at times did not allow an academy to be maintained in that city, he was too old to move elsewhere. His son Rabban Gamliel IV, on the other hand, settled in Caesarea where an academy could be maintained, due to the influence of Rabbi Avahu with the authorities.
Rabbi Avahu was devoted to the Torah. When he once came to Tiberias he was met by the disciples of Rabbi Jochanan who noticed that his face was suffused with joy. When Rabbi Jochanan later asked what was the cause of his joy, he replied that he had found an old Tosephta which shed new light on the subject that he was then studying.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ק״י א׳.</span></i>
Another time it was related that Rabbi Avahu fasted on the day that a scholar died.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי מועד קטן פרק ג׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
The following of Rabbi Avahu’s ethical teachings deserve to be mentioned:
“Repentance is the greatest thing in the world; even saints cannot attain the position of penitents.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ל״ד בי.</span></i>
“One should strive to be among the persecuted rather than among the oppressors.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא צ״ג א׳.</span></i>
“One should not rule his household by fear.”<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ז׳ א׳.</span></i>
During a discussion on the manner in which the world had been created, Rabbi Avahu said: “God had created previous worlds which He destroyed, because He had not been pleased with them until He created the present world which is permanent.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ג׳ פּיסקא ט׳.</span></i>
The verse “They who sit at the gates shall speak against me” (Psalms, 69:13), he interpreted to refer to those who ridicule the Jews in their theatres and circuses. Rabbi Avahu then described the manner in which the theatre of his time ridiculed the Jews. They would bring out on the stage a camel whose head was bowed and one actor would then ask another: “Can you tell me why this camel is so sad?” and the other would reply: “This is the Sabbatical year of the Jews and since they do not have enough food they eat the camel’s food and that makes the camel sad.”
“And why is the price of oil so high?” the first actor would ask again. The other actor would then reply: “Since the Jews strictly observe their Sabbath, on which day they eat the food which they accumulated during a whole week, they never have enough wood to cook all that food, thus they use their beds as fuel; when their beds are burned, they are forced to sleep on the floor, and since that makes them dirty and dusty, they rub oil all over their bodies and that’s why oil is so expensive.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּתיחתא דאיכה רבתי פּיסקא י״ז.</span></i>
Anyone who is familiar with the Bible is acquainted with the story of Saul who sought a young man who could play well in order to soothe his melancholy. On that occasion one of Saul’s servants answered that the son of Jesse was “skilful as a player and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and intelligent in speech, and a person of a good form, and the Lord is with him.” (Sam. I, 17:18.) Rabbi Avahu interpreted this verse to mean that “skilful as a player” indicated that David was versed in the Scriptures; “a mighty valiant man,” that he was strong in Mishna; “a man of war,” that he was skilled in the battles of the Torah; “intelligent in speech,” that he understood the value of good deeds; “a person of good form,” that he understood the Talmud. Another interpretation of Rabbi Avahu to the same verse declared that “intelligent in speech” indicated that David could deduce conclusions; “a man of good form,” that his face shone in Halacha; and “the Lord is with him,” that the law was established according to his opinion.
The following is another sample of Rabbi Avahu’s method of interpretation: Of the creation of the world the Bible says that the earth “was without form, and void.” This expression was then interpreted to mean that the earth was wondering at the void which pervaded it. Rabbi Avahu compared this to a king who had bought two slaves on one contract and for the same price. The king then commanded that one of the slaves should be fed from the royal kitchen and that the other one should obtain his own food. The second slave therefore wondered: “We were both bought on one contract and for the same price and yet I must obtain my own food or starve.” The earth likewise wondered and said: “The creatures of Heaven and those of the earth were created at the same time and yet creatures of Heaven are nourished by the divine Shechinah while the creatures on earth must labor for their food else they would starve.”<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ב׳ פּיסקא ב׳.</span></i>
On one occasion Rabbi Avahu lectured on Hagada in the same city where Rabbi Chiya bar Aba lectured on Halacha. The inhabitants of the city then flocked to hear Rabbi Avahu and Rabbi Chiya felt grieved at this. But Rabbi Avahu consoled him with the following parable: “Two merchants once came to a city; one of them brought precious stones to sell while the other brought trinkets. Did not most of the people run to the merchant who sold trinkets?”<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה מ׳ א׳.</span></i> The Talmud further relates that on that day Rabbi Avahu showed special honor to Rabbi Chiya. On all other occasions it was customary for Rabbi Chiya to escort Rabbi Avahu to his hostelry whenever they chanced to be in the same city. This honor was accorded to Rabbi Avahu because he was considered to be the representative of the Jewish people to the Roman government. But on that day the procedure was reversed and Rabbi Avahu escorted Rabbi Chiya to his hostelry in order to console him in his grief at being slighted by the inhabitants of the city.
As a result of Rabbi Avahu’s residence in Caesarea, the city came to be known as a seat of learning even as it was during the days of Rabbi Oshiya Raba. The academy where Rabbi Avahu taught was known as “Mardutha”, which some explained, indicated that the academy was a nest of rebellion against Rome, because “Mardutha” signifies revolt.<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ג׳ הלכה א׳, סנהדרין פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> It was further related that when Rabbi Avahu studied during the night, he did not remove his phylacteries,<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ב׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i> and that when he lectured his hearers could see a halo about him.<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שיר השירים רבה פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא נ״ב.</span></i> When Rabbi Avahu died, the mourning was so great that even the pillars in the city were believed to shed tears.<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי עבודה זרה פרק ג׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
“Three types of sin”, Rabbi Avahu said, “are never forgiven by God. These are deception, robbery, and idol worshiping.”<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא נ״ט א׳.</span></i> When he heard scholars debating the cause of the destruction of Jerusalem, he declared that it was due to the neglect of reciting the Shema morning and evening.<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ט א׳.</span></i>
One of Rabbi Avahu’s sons, Rabbi Chanina, was sent to Tiberias to engage in study. But the young man devoted himself primarily to charitable deeds, especially to burying the dead. Rabbi Avahu then wrote to him: “Have I sent you to Tiberias because there were not enough graves in Caesarea? Furthermore it is an accepted rule that learning is more important than charitable deeds.”<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי פּסחים פרק ג׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i>
Poverty was then the share of many scholars and Rabbi Avahu, who was himself wealthy, consoled the needy scholars with the following words: “A scholar who devotes himself to learning despite his poverty is certain to partake of the nobility of the Shechinah in the world to come.”<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה מ״ט א׳.</span></i> Of those who forgot their learning he said: “One who forgets anything of his learning should be demoted from his position.”<sup class="footnote-marker">30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא ל״ח ב׳.</span></i>
Like other scholars Rabbi Avahu also believed that God recognized the holidays as they were determined by the high court and he said: “When five elders gather to determine a leap year, God leaves His heavenly retinue and he descends to earth in His Majesty. The angels then wonder since they know that were the people to err God would correct them.”<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ויקרא רבה פּרשה כ״ט פּיסקא ג׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Avahu was once asked whether “Hallel” should be recited on New Year and the Day of Atonement. He then declared that on these days the angels come before God and say: “Your Jews are celebrating holidays and they do not recite ‘Hallel’ (praise)”. God then answers them: “When a mortal king sits in judgment and the books of life and death are open before him, do his subjects sing his praise at that moment?”<sup class="footnote-marker">32)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה ל״ב ב׳.</span></i>
“When Jews are aided in time of need”, Rabbi Avahu said, “it is as if God were also aided for the Scriptures declare ‘I am with him in affliction’. When Jews are in need it is as if God were also in need; by aiding them He also aids Himself.”<sup class="footnote-marker">33)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תנחומא פּ׳ אחרי פּיסקא י״ב.</span></i> “It is an accepted rule that God forgets nothing”, he continued, “but when the punishment of Jews for their sins is concerned, He overlooks many things.”<sup class="footnote-marker">34)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי פּאה פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
Of the passage “I hear of your evil dealings from all this people” (Sam. I, 2:23), Rabbi Avahu said: “The Scriptures intend to teach the people ethical behavior. When one hears good things of his neighbor, he should repeat it in the name of the person that he had heard it from; but when one hears evil of his neighbor and he wishes to admonish him, he should not name the person by whom he was informed.<sup class="footnote-marker">35)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מדרש שמואל פּרשה ז׳.</span></i>
The Biblical statement “I am the Lord your God” Rabbi Avahu explained as an indication that God was not like mortal rulers. Therefore God said “I am first”, and I have no father; “I am last”, and I have no brother; “Beside me there is no God,” and I have no sons.<sup class="footnote-marker">36)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שמות רבה פּרשה כ״ט פּיסקא ד׳.</span></i>
During a discussion concerning wise men Rabbi Avahu said: “God gives wisdom to the wise as the Scriptures say “In the heart of every wise man I put wisdom.”<sup class="footnote-marker">37)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות נ״ה א׳.</span></i>
When a child of Rabbi Avahu died, two scholars came to console him but they remained silent fearing to grieve him by mentioning the dead child. Rabbi Avahu then explained to them that God’s judgment could not be otherwise than just and he said: “When an earthly court condemns one to death, the relatives of the condemned man come to greet the judges and the witnesses to show that they bear no ill will against them and that they are convinced of the justice of the sentence despite the fact that earthly courts are full of deception and robbery and error and they are also transitory. How much greater is the duty to recognize the justice of the judgment of God before whom there is no deception nor robbery nor error?”<sup class="footnote-marker">38)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי סנהדרין פרק ו׳ הלכה י׳.</span></i>

Rabbi Chiya bar Aba Hacohen

R<small>ABBI</small> C<small>HIYA BAR</small> A<small>BA</small> H<small>ACOHEN</small> is not to be confused with the Tana Rabbi Chiya Raba who lived four generations earlier during the time of Rabbi Jehudah Hanasi. He came to Palestine from Babylonia together with his brother Simeon. Since no mention is made of his teachers in Babylonia it is to be assumed that he left that country while still very young. Upon his arrival in Palestine he still found the first of the Amoraim Rabbi Chanina bar Chama and Rabbi Joshua ben Levi who were then already old men. When Rabbi Chiya came to Sephoris he was befriended by Rabbi Chanina bar Chama who often leaned on him when he walked through the streets; he was also respected by Resh Lakish who engaged him to tutor his children. Rabbi Jochanan likewise loved his pupil Rabbi Chiya and called him “my child”.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי עבודה זרה פרק ב׳ הלכה ח׳.</span></i> When Rabbi Chiya fell ill, Rabbi Jochanan came to visit him and asked him: “Do you love your suffering?”, implying thereby that suffering atones for one’s sins, but Rabbi Chiya replied: “I want neither suffering nor its reward”. Rabbi Jochanan then asked him to give his hand and he cured him.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ה׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Chiya bar Aba was also respected by the Patriarch Rabbi Jehudah N’siah the Second who empowered him to visit various cities together with Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi for the purpose of clarifying matters of religious conduct and also in order to appoint tax collectors in these cities for the government and for the Nasi.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי חגיגה פרק א׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Chiya suffered greatly in Palestine. Although he did not suffer want to the same extent as his brother did, he nevertheless was subject to other limitations and hindrances. Friends then advised him to leave Palestine, but for some time he refused to leave the country. Finally he was compelled by circumstances to leave when he no longer wanted to gain his sustenance from tithes which in his eyes amounted to charity and made him feel dependent. He was at that time the “Cohen” of the family Silone which gave him its tithes. When a dispute arose concerning the interpretation of a law which Rabbi Chiya wanted to interpret more leniently than the other scholars, he feared that his action would be explained as an attempt to favor the family from whom he derived his livelihood.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שביעית פרק ג׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> He then went to Babylonia and he was detained by no one. Rabbi Chiya asked Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath to obtain for him a letter of recommendation from the Nasi and the latter immediately granted his request. In his letter to the Jews of Babylonia the Nasi wrote: “We are sending you a great man who is our messenger and who is like ourselves.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי חגיגה פרק א׳ הלכה ח׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Chiya later returned to Palestine where he remained permanently. He lived in several cities, namely in Gabala, which was situated between Beth Shean and Tiberias,<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות מ״ו א׳.</span></i> in Roma which was located in Galilee,<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי מעשר שני פרק ד׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> in Sephoris,<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה נ״ב פּיסקא ב׳.</span></i> and in Lodacea.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה י״א פּיסקא ד׳.</span></i> His permanent residence was later in Tyre which had once been a Phoenician city, but at that time it contained a Jewish community and was considered to be a part of Palestine.
It was told that at the death of Rabbi Jehudah N’siah the Second priests were permitted to participate in the burial of the Nasi. Rabbi Zeira, who was also a priest, disapproved of this ruling and Rabbi Chiya forced him to touch the body of this Nasi. It appears that Rabbi Chiya was not very strict in the observance of the priestly restrictions on other occasion as well. Thus it was told that when emperor Diocletian visited Tyre, Rabbi Chiya passed through a cemetery to see him.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ג׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Chiya bar Aba was very pious and many wondrous tales were related of the effects of his prayers. Some he cured through prayer and for others he obtained long life. Once there appeared a wild animal which destroyed all the trees which it chanced upon. The people came to Rabbi Chiya to ask him to pray that the animal should depart. He prayed and the animal suddenly heard the voice of its mother<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">The above mentioned Midrash does not name the animal and merely refers to it as <span dir="rtl">״גורא״</span> a young beast. This was assumed to be a <span dir="rtl">״ראם״</span> concerning the nature of which commentators differed. According to a Midrash the <span dir="rtl">״ראם״</span> was a gigantic animal which Noah could not take into the Ark, because of its size and he therefore tied it to the Ark that it might swim along with it. The “Septuaginta” (Greek translation of the Bible) identified the <span dir="rtl">״ראם״</span> with a unicorn. Others gave differing descriptions. It nevertheless appears that the animal referred to in the Midrash was a young elephant which uprooted trees and which <i>fled when it heard</i> the call of his mother.</i> and fled to the desert whence it came.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ל״א פּיסקא י״ח.</span></i>
Rabbi Chiya bar Aba was not an adherent of Hagada and when he lectured on Halacha in the same city with Rabbi Avahu of Caesarea, the people flocked to hear Rabbi Avahu whose discourse dealt with Hagada. The opinion of Rabbi Chiya concerning Hagada is illustrated by the incident when he saw a book of Hagadoth and remarked: “Even though it may contain some good things, the hands of him who wrote the book should be cut off.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שבת פרק ט״ז פּיסקא א׳.</span></i> We may also assume that his knowledge of the Bible was limited.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספות בבא בתרא קי״ג א׳.</span></i> One of his pupils once asked him the reason why the word <span dir="rtl">״טוב״</span> (good) was mentioned in the version of the ten commandments given in Deuteronomy but not in the first version. To this Rabbi Chiya replied: “Rather than to ask me why the word <span dir="rtl">״טוב״</span> is or is not used, you should ask me whether it is used at all for I do not know of it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא נ״ה א׳.</span></i>
Like his contemporaries Rabbi Chiya also revered the Sabbath above all and he maintained that because of its merit the Jews will be redeemed.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ויקרא רבה פּרשה ג׳ פּיסקא א׳.</span></i>
“When Jews pray”, Rabbi Chiya said, “they do not all end their prayers at the same time for each group prays separately. But when all the prayers are finished, the angel who is in charge of prayer gathers them and weaves out of them crowns for the head of God who adorns Himself with the prayers of Israel.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שמות רבה פּרשה כ״א פּיסקא ד׳.</span></i>
“One who observes the Shema is like one who observes all the Ten Commandments for the latter were given at the time of the morning Shema and all of them are also included in the Shema.”<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מדרש פּסיקתא חדתא לחג השבועות.</span></i>
Other statements of Rabbi Chiya give a clear picture of the time during which he lived. Thus he said:
“Even a father and a son or a teacher and his pupil waged hot discussions on their differences of opinion while interpreting their studies, but they do not part until they grow to love each other.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ל׳ ב׳.</span></i>
“If one were to tell you that you should give your life for the santification of the name of God, you may say to him: ‘I will do so if I am to be killed at once, but not if I have to undergo the ordeal of previous generations when heated balls of iron were placed under the arms of Jews or when their nails were pierced with wire.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שיר השירים רבה פרק ב׳ פּיסקא י״ח.</span></i>
“The hatred of the Gentile nations toward the Jews may be compared to a man who is an enemy of the king and wishes to harm him, but cannot do so. Such a man at least wants to destroy the statue of the king, but fearing that he would be executed for such a deed, he undermines the wall of the monument thus causing it to fall. Gentile nations likewise fear to come out against God and they therefore persecute the Jews.”<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שמות רבה פּרשה נ״א פּיסקא ד׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Chiya lived to a ripe old age and all of his sons grew up to be scholars. A special prayer of Rabbi Chiya is of great interest. It said: “May it be Thy will, oh Lord our God and God of our fathers, that You should turn our hearts to complete repentance, that we should not be shamed before our fathers in the world to come, that You should inspire our hearts with fear of Thy name and that You should remove us from that which You hate and that You should bring us near to that which You love and that You should be merciful to us for the sake of Your name.”<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ד׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>

Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi

T<small>HE TWO</small> A<small>MORAIM</small>, Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi, were always mentioned together due to the great bond of friendship which united them. But before we proceed to describe the lives of these two Amoraim we must mention an event which transpired in Palmyra (in the Bible “Tadmor,” in the Talmud “Tarmud”), a city located in an oasis in the Syrian desert between the Euphrates and Damascus.
In the city of Palmyra there lived a robber chieftain who became a legitimate ruler when he aided the Romans in their war against the Persians of Babylonia. The name of this chieftain was Barnezer Odenate. When the Romans were defeated by the Persians and their leaders were taken captive, Odenate librated them and preserved Roman rule in Syria. Emperor Galianus (264 C. E.) then recognized him as co-ruler in Syria. However, this situation did not last long for the wife of the chieftain, later queen Zenobia, hired assassins to murder her husband in order that she might rule in his stead. With her wisdom and her organizational talents she succeeded in transforming Palmyra into a metropolis. In this she was aided by the fact that the city was situated at the crossroads of important caravan routes. The city was then enlarged by the construction of beautiful palaces in the Roman style.
Some historians maintain that Zenobia embraced Judaism or that she was sympathetic to the Jewish faith. Jewish historians, however, deny this and make no mention of any kind acts toward the Jews on her part. But all Roman historians concurred in their praise of her beauty, education and good taste. She was a gifted diplomat and she succeeded in persuading all the rulers of western Asia to unite against emperor Aurelius. Aurelius advanced against Zenobia with a large army when he realized that she planned to liberate her country from Roman domination. In this venture he was also successful and he devastated her land.
It appears that the Jews of Palestine were not satisfied with the proximity of Zenobia’s kingdom and they aided the Romans. An expression current among the Jews of that time stated: “Happy is he who will live to see the destruction of Tadmor”. The problem also arose whether converts from Palmyra were to be accepted since the population of this city was of mixed origin.
According to the Scriptures (Kings I, 9:18) Palmyra was founded by king Solomon who colonized it with people from various nations. It is also known that Zenobia was herself an offspring of a mixed marriage. For this reason it was an accepted opinion that “Jews would celebrate the day of the destruction of Tadmor.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ט״ז ב׳, ירושלמי תענית פרק ד׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>
That the Jews participated in this war on the side of Rome is evident from numerous statements in the Talmud. Thus it is told that Rabbi Ami interceded for a man named Zeira bar Chanina who was captured in the city of Saphsipha as a warrior against Palmyra. Rabbi Ami then implored Zenobia to spare the man’s life, but she said to him: “Do you permit yourself to do anything you choose because God always performs miracles for you?” At about the same time Rabbi Asi was also captured by the soldiers of Palmyra and was condemned to death. Resh Lakish then hastened to save him saying that he would sacrifice his own life if necessary to achieve his aim.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי תרומות פרק ה׳ הלכה י׳.</span></i>
The Palestinian Patriarch of that time was R. Jehudah N’siah the Third. He was nearly always ignored by the scholars, and when the latter consulted him in some matter out of deference for his office, he always sought the advice of Rabbi Ami. The Nasi once sent Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi to the various cities of Palestine, to appoint teachers of the Bible and the Mishna. They then arrived in a certain city where there were no teachers and they asked the leaders of the community whether they had engaged watchmen. The city watchmen were pointed out to them, but they remarked: “These are not watchmen! The real watchmen of a city are the teachers who instruct the children.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי חגיגה פרק א׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i>
The animosity between Jews and Samaritans grew acute at that time due to the friendship of the latter toward the Romans and the Christians. Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi then instructed the Jews to avoid the Samaritans and to consider them as pagans in all matters and particularly in the matter of the use of their wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין ז׳ א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi came from Babylonia where they previously studied together.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ה א׳.</span></i> Both immediately became pupils of Rabbi Jochanan,<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קמ״ה ב׳.</span></i> and later they were ordained at the same time. The day of their ordination was a feast day for the other pupils who sang their praise in the following words: “Only pupils like you should be ordained.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות י״ז א׳.</span></i>
Travel between Palestine and Babylonia was free and undisturbed at that time and scholars constantly went from one country to the other. In Babylonia the academies of Sura and Pumbeditha were renowned. Whether Rabbi Ami quoted a law which he heard in Babylonia he would say: “Our teachers in Babylonia said.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבועות מ״ז א׳.</span></i> Rabbi Asi’s coming to Palestine was said to have been caused by his desire to escape his capricious, aged mother.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ל״א ב׳.</span></i>
We have mentioned above that Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi lived in great friendship. They attended the same academy and after their ordination they enjoyed the same measure of honor. They were referred to as “the Judges of Palestine”<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין י״ז ב׳.</span></i> or “the honorable Priests of Palestine”.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין נ״ט ב׳.</span></i> Rabbi Ami was also called “a great man,”<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות כ״א ב׳.</span></i> and Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath referred to Rabbi Asi as “the example of the generation.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין ק״ג ב׳.</span></i>
After the death of Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath both headed the academy in Tiberias. It was related that when prayer time came each one of them would pray alone between the columns of the academy.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ה׳ א׳, ל׳ ב׳.</span></i> Often they interrupted their studies and called out: “He who wants to know the law or seeks judgment, let him enter.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת י׳ א׳.</span></i>
Together with Rabbi Chiya bar Aba they once judged a licentious woman named Tamar and they sentenced her to be beaten with rods. The woman complained to the Roman authorities that they had exceeded their rights in passing judgment affecting the life of a person. Rabbi Avahu successfully interceded for them since he was influential with the Romans, but the woman could not be persuaded to withdraw her complaint. Rabbi Avahu then sent an allegoric message to the defendants. Because of the original form of the message we offer here a literal translation of it: “We have conciliated the three accusers, the Good Child, the Educated one and the Man of the Sea, but the Date (Tamar) persists in its bitterness and we sought to sweeten it, but vain were the efforts of the Goldsmith.” The explanation of this message is as follows: Rabbi Avahu conciliated the three judges, one of whom was named Eudokos (good child), the other Eumathes (educated), and the third Thelaseus (sea man). But the woman Tamar persists in her bitterness and would not be placated with money.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי מגלה פרק ג׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>
Upon their arrival in Palestine, Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi were pupils of Rabbi Jochanan to whom they were so attached that after his death they mourned him as one mourns a relative. They were also close friends of Rabbi Yitzchak the Blacksmith, although there exist Halachoth in the name of Rabbi Yitzchak and Rabbi Ami alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי כלאים פרק ו׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> As they once visited Rabbi Yitzchak in his home one of them asked him that he should expound some matter in Halacha while the other asked that he should discuss some Hagadic subject. Rabbi Yitzchak replied: “What you demand of me, may be compared to a man who has two wives, one young and the other old. The young wife plucks the grey hair out of his head and the old wife plucks the black hair until he remains bald. You likewise may cause me to say nothing by your requests; but I will tell you something that will please both of you and that will contain Halacha and Hagada.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא ס׳ ב׳.</span></i>
During a feast in the house of Rabbi Ami one of the guests wished to drink boiled wine that had remained uncovered overnight. Rabbi Ami said to him: “One who wishes to die should go to his own house to die.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי תרומות פרק ח׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
When Rabbi Ami became head of the academy in Tiberias he came into close contact with the Nasi. The latter once asked him the meaning of the verse, “Have faith in the Lord forever, for the Lord is the rock of the ages.” Rabbi Ami replied that one who had faith in God would be protected by Him in both worlds.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מנחות כ״ט ב׳.</span></i>. It was said that the Nasi bestowed honors and ordination upon people for a price and without consideration for their merit. Rabbi Ami then said that the Nasi broke the commandment not to make gold and silver gods. During a calamity which afflicted the whole people the Nasi decreed thirteen fast days. When these were of no avail he wanted to decree another fast day, but Rabbi Ami objected on the ground that the people should not be taxed beyond their endurance and the Nasi had to comply with his decision.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית י״ד ב׳.</span></i>
On the day of the coronation of Diocletian, Rabbi Ami dreamed that it was announced in heaven that “Magdiel was crowned today.” This dream he interpreted as an omen that the emperor following Diocletian would be the last ruler of Rome. (“Magdiel” in the Bible preceded the last of the rulers of Edom.) This prophecy partly came true for the successor of Diocletian was followed by Constantine the Great under whose rule Rome became a Christian kingdom.
It is told that when Rabbi Ami headed the academy a bag of gold was once brought to him and he distributed it among the students.<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין ק״ז ב׳.</span></i> Another version relates that he found a jar full of gold and the Romans informed him that he could use it as he saw fit, for according to the Roman law a man could claim lawful ownership to any article that he found.<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא כ״ח ב׳.</span></i>
Statements of Rabbi Ami occur in nearly every part of both the Babylonian and the Jerusalem Talmud. Although he was probably the first one in his generation who ascribed sanctity to the opinions of previous Amoraim, he nevertheless was not modest in-so-far as his own achievements were concerned and he once said: “From Ami, the son of Nathan, learning will issue for all Israel.”<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין מ״ד א׳.</span></i>
On numerous occasions he sought to lighten the burden of the laws. Thus he opposed the strictures of the scholars of Tiberias who would prohibit the spreading of fishing nets during the intermediate days of the holidays (<span dir="rtl">חול המועד</span>) for fear that it would interfere with the festive mood of the occasion.<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי פּסחים פרק ד׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> When he was asked whether Jews were permitted to participate in festivities of pagans, he wished to permit it for the sake of maintaining peace with the neighboring people, but Rabbi Aba reminded him that Rabbi Chiya had forbidden it and Rabbi Ami remarked: “Let us praise God that Rabbi Aba called our attention to the opinion of Rabbi Chiya, else we would have fallen into idolatry.”<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי דמאי פרק ד׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
Another time a slave brought a bill of divorce for a Jewish woman and Rabbi Ami wished to declare the divorce to be valid although it was an accepted rule that a slave may not testify. Again Rabbi Aba called his attention to a decision of Rabbi Chiya which prohibited such a procedure and Rabbi Ami said: “Let us praise God that Rabbi Aba reminded us of the opinion of Rabbi Chiya, else we would have allowed a married woman to remarry.”<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי גטין פרק ב׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i>
Both, Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi, were equally respected. Rabbi Ami is always mentioned first in the Babylonian Talmud, but in the Jerusalem Talmud Rabbi Asi is sometimes mentioned first. On one occasion we also find Rabbi Asi address Ami as Rabbi. This, however, is explained by the fact that Rabbi Ami was the older of the two.<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין נ״ד ב׳.</span></i> Both of them were known as saintly men and even when they went in dangerous places where others suffered harm, they emerged unharmed.<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ס״ב א׳.</span></i> Rabbi Asi died first, as is evident from the fact that he died in Tiberias, while Rabbi Ami spent the last days of his life in Caesarea.<sup class="footnote-marker">30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי פּסחים פרק ד׳ הלכה ט׳.</span></i> After his death the political situation of the Jews deteriorated to such an extent that no one could be elected to head the academy.
Rabbi Ami was also the author of the well known statement which inspired the phantasy of many poets to the elaboration of a dramatic story. When the power of faith was being discussed, Rabbi Ami said: “We can see the greatness of people who possess faith from the story of the weasel and the well.” He concluded with the following words: “Even a person who believes this story is certain to be rewarded, how much greater will be the reward of one who believes in God.”<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית ה׳ א׳.</span></i> It appears that the story of the weasel and the well was then very popular. It is also possible that it was written down in some Midrash and that Rashi, Tosephoth and the author of “Aruch” obtained it from that Midrash.
“A maiden,” thus the story runs, “once lost her way and being very thirsty she bent over a well to draw some water and fell into it. A young man who chanced to pass by heard her cries. At first he was fearful lest it was some evil spirit which wished to draw him into the well and he asked the maiden to swear by the name of God that she was human and not an evil spirit. When he drew her out of the well, his passions were aroused by her beauty, but she implored him not to sin, promising to marry him according to the laws of Israel. They then swore fidelity to each other and, as a weasel ran by, they called upon it and upon the well to witness their troth.
“The two young people then parted and the young man forgot his oath. He did not come to the maiden’s father to claim her and he married another woman. His wife bore him two children one of which was killed by a weasel and the other was drowned in a well. His wife complained that the children must have lost their lives as a result of the sins of their father and he then remembered the oath which he swore to the maiden at the well. He thereupon divorced his wife and he found the maiden, to whom he swore fidelity, nearly out of her mind with expectation. He then fulfilled his vow and married her.”<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">This story was poetically rewritten in Hebrew by Moshe Laski under the name <span dir="rtl">״נאמני ארץ״</span> <span dir="ltr">(1840)</span>, by Eliyahu Mordechai Werbel under the name of <span dir="rtl">״חולדה ובור״</span> <span dir="ltr">(1852)</span>, and by Alexander Langbank under the name of <span dir="rtl">״העדים האלמים״</span>. In Yiddish it was dramatized by Abraham Goldfaden in the well known operetta “Sulamith.”</i>
Regarding everyday conduct Rabbi Ami commanded that one should not take money into his mouth, nor place food beneath one’s bed, nor hold bread under one’s arm, nor allow a knife to stick in radishes or lemons.<sup class="footnote-marker">32)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי תרומות פרק ח׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i> He also named omens by which one was to know on the new year whether he would survive the coming year and whether a trip, or some occupation that is undertaken, would be accomplished successfully.<sup class="footnote-marker">33)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">הוריות י״ב א׳, כריתות ה׳ ב׳.</span></i>
One of the scholars once declared that there were three types of arrogant creatures in the world: the dog among the animals, the cock among the fowl and the Jews among the nations. Rabbi Ami then declared that the arrogance of these creatures was a virtue rather than a fault. This he held to be particularly true of the Jews who readily offer their lives for their faith.<sup class="footnote-marker">34)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שמות רבה פּרשה מ״ב פּיסקא ט׳.</span></i>
Other expressions of Rabbi Ami indicate that he did not maintain friendly relations with pagans—thus he said that one should not teach Torah to a pagan.<sup class="footnote-marker">35)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה י״ג א׳.</span></i>
The Biblical verse “Let us make man” which other scholars found difficult to explain because of the implication that God was assisted in the creation of man, Rabbi Ami ingeniously explained by saying that God had consulted his own heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">36)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ח׳ פּיסקא ג׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Asi was once sent by the Nasi to appoint tax collectors in various cities. Many people at that time refused to accept this office because of the heavy responsibility which it involved. Rabbi Asi persuaded some of them to accept the office of tax collector by the promise of fame. He also established the rule that “two brothers may not represent the same community.”<sup class="footnote-marker">37)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי פּאה פרק ח׳ הלכה ו׳, שקלים פרק ה׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>
The opinions of Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi are often introduced in the Talmud by the words “both said.” On other occasions, however, their opinions are quoted separately and at times they even differed.<sup class="footnote-marker">38)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא ע״ד ב׳, ע״ה א׳.</span></i>
“Why are children taught the chapters on priesthood before Genesis,” Rabbi Asi asked and he gave the following answer: “God says that sacrifices are pure and children are pure; it is therefore fitting that children should begin their studies with a sacred subject.”<sup class="footnote-marker">39)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ויקרא רבה פּרשה ז׳ פּיסקא ג׳.</span></i>
It is also related that a weaver once came before Rabbi Jochanan and told that in his dream he had seen the sky fall and a disciple of Rabbi Jochanan supported it with his hand. Rabbi Jochanan asked the man whether he would recognize him and the weaver asked him to pass his students before him. This was done and the weaver pointed to Rabbi Asi as the man who had supported the sky.<sup class="footnote-marker">40)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קהלת רבה פּרשה ט׳ פּיסקא ה׳.</span></i>
When Rabbi Asi died, it was said that the gate of Tiberias collapsed.<sup class="footnote-marker">41)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי עבודה זרה פרק ג׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> Another version told of cedar trees being uprooted on the day of his death.<sup class="footnote-marker">42)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ה ב׳.</span></i>

Rabbi Yitschak the Blacksmith

R<small>ABBI</small> Y<small>ITZCHAK</small> N<small>APCHA</small> (<small>THE</small> B<small>LACKSMITH</small>) was one of the most prominent disciples of Rabbi Jochanan and a master of Hagada who lived during the second, third and fourth generations of “Amoraim.” His surname “Napcha” is variously interpreted. Some claim that it referred to his occupation as a blacksmith, although the Talmud never mentioned it explicitly, while others maintained that he was a native of a city of that name. Such a city is mentioned in the travels of Benjamin of Tudela. Rabbi Yitzchak Napcha, of whom this chapter treats, should not be confused with another man of the same name who lived during the days of Rabbi Jehudah bar Elai.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספתא ערובין פרק ז׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Yitzchak Napcha is never mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud by this name. Some Talmud critics therefore believe that Rabbi Yitzchak bar Tavlai, who is mentioned there, is identical with Rabbi Yitzchak Napcha. References in the Jerusalem Talmud to Rabbi Yitzchak, without any further designation, are also believed to refer to Rabbi Yitzchak Napcha.
The poverty which characterized the time of Rabbi Yitzchak is best illustrated by his remark that “the curse of God that people shall be forced to eat the grass of the fields applies only to the present generations. People suffer such hunger these days that they cannot wait for the grain to ripen in the field and they pluck it and eat it while it is still green.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה כ׳ פּיסקא כ״ד.</span></i> “In such times,” Rabbi Yitzchak added, “people are not interested in learning and they merely wish to hear words of consolation.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שיר השירים רבה פּרשה ב׳ פּיסקא י״ד.</span></i>
Rabbi Yitzchak Napcha lived in Tiberias together with his master Rabbi Jochanan and his friends R. Elazar ben Pedath and R. Ami. He also maintained close bonds of friendship with other scholars who frequently visited him at his house to discuss various laws and he also visited their homes for the same purpose.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות מ״ח ב׳, עבודה זרה כ״ד א׳, מועד קטן כ׳ א׳.</span></i> Differences of opinion at times marked his relations with Rabbi Ami. Thus one declared that if a needle was found in the lung of an animal its flesh was kosher, while the other held it to be unfit to eat.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין מ״ח ב׳.</span></i> Similarly Rabbi Yitzchak passed sentence whether it was permissible to eat onions harvested during the Sabbatical year while Rabbi Ami didn’t know how to decide this law.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדרים נ״ז ב׳.</span></i>
That the opinions of Rabbi Yitzchak were held above those of other scholars is also evident from the fact that when the Nasi, Rabbi Jehudah the Second, entertained priests at his table and he did not know whether it was permissible to serve them with the flesh of a first born animal, he first inquired the opinion of Rabbi Ami and later he asked the same question of Rabbi Yitzchak for a final decision.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ביצה כ״ז א׳.</span></i> It may be assumed that Rabbi Yitzchak was at that time a judge in Tiberias and since his teachings were popular, his decisions were accepted in all matters of Halacha.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא קי״ז ב׳, בבא בתרא ק״ע א׳.</span></i>
At a later date Rabbi Yitzchak Napcha went to Babylonia. This journey apparently took place after the destruction of Tiberias during the Roman wars, when Rabbi Ami transferred his academy to Caesarea, where he could continue his teaching under the protection of Rabbi Avahu. Rabbi Yitzchak’s stay in Babylonia coincided with the period of the influence of R. Shesheth.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ד ב׳.</span></i>
When Rabbi Yitzchak returned to Palestine, he settled in Caesarea where he appears to have been a member of Rabbi Avahu’s court. There he was once confronted with the problem whether it was permissible to read the weekly portion of the Bible in the Synagogue from a Torah which contained only one of the books of the Pentateuch. Rabbi Yitzchak could not answer this question, but Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani reminded him of the rule that a scroll of the Torah from which even one parchment was missing, could not be used for reading in the Synagogue; it thus became apparent that a scroll which contained only one of the books of the Pentateuch could not be used.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ס׳ א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Yitzchak yearned for the restoration of Jerusalem. His heart was filled with anguish when he saw Caesarea in all its glamor while Jerusalem lay desolate. He then came to the conclusion that these two cities—Cesarea and Jerusalem—could not both thrive at the same time and that the prosperity of one of them was inevitably bound up with the destruction of the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה ו׳ א׳.</span></i> While speaking of these cities Rabbi Yitzchak mentioned a people, “Germamia of Edom”—which could destroy the whole world, if God would only allow it. This people, he said, restrains the Romans. Rabbi Yitzchak was no doubt referring to the Germans, who then conducted a struggle against Rome and of whom vague rumors reached the Jews of Palestine.
On another occasion Rabbi Yitzchak interpreted the verse “A generation comes and a generation goes, but the earth endures for ever,” as referring to the various kingdoms of the world which rise and fall while the Jewish people remains eternal.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קהלת רבה פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא ד׳.</span></i>
Most of the expositions of Rabbi Yitzchak remained in the form of introductions to the books of the Scriptures. The following are some of the most interesting excerpts from his lectures:
“It is impossible to measure the strength of one’s evil desires which become renewed daily.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוכה נ״ב א׳, קדושין ל׳ ב׳.</span></i> Even when one mourns for the dead, his evil desires are with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין פּ׳ ב׳.</span></i> Man is so controlled by his desires that even though these enter as visitors, they immediately possess his entire being.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה כ״ב פּיסקא י״א.</span></i>
“He who angers his neighbor, even though he does so with words only, must conciliate him. If he possesses money, he must seek conciliation through money; he should also ask his friends to intercede for him and to gain forgiveness for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא פּ״ז א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Yitzchak highly valued charity, but he considered kind words spoken to the poor to be of even greater merit than money. He therefore said: “One who gives a penny to a poor man, will be blessed with six blessings, but one who speaks kind words to the poor, will be blessed with all seven blessings.”<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא ט׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Like his contemporaries he also valued prayer and he said: “Prayer is more important than sacrifices. Thus we see that when Samuel’s father came to Shiloh, he first bowed and then he offered sacrifices.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מדרש שמואל פּרשה א׳.</span></i>
“Why were Abraham and Isaac childless?” Rabbi Yitzchak asked. He provided the answer himself by saying that “God yearns for the prayers of saints and He caused Abraham and Isaac to be childless in order that they might pray to him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ס״ד א׳.</span></i>
Of those who indulged in many vows in the hope of finding favor in the eyes of God, Rabbi Yitzchak said: “He who makes a vow is like a person who pierces his heart with a sword. Are not the prohibitions of the Torah sufficient that people assume additional limitations?”<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי נדרים פרק ט׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Yitzchak highly valued the study of the Torah and he said: “The fact that people forget what they have learned, is for their own benefit, for if they would not forget that which they had learned then a person would devote himself to the Torah for two or three years and he would then turn to other occupations. But since it is in the nature of man to forget, he must always continue to study.”<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קהלת רבה פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא י״ג.</span></i>
The two olives which the prophet Zechariah saw in one of his visions Rabbi Yitzchak explained as referring to the scholars of Palestine, who are as gentle and as dear to each other as oil, while the scholars of Babylonia embitter each other’s lives like an olive tree.<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין כ״ד א׳.</span></i>
Remarkably interesting are Rabbi Yitzchak’s descriptions of the emotions of Moses as his death approached. The soul of Moses refused to leave him and Moses said to it: “It seems that the Angel of death desires to take you,” but the soul replied: “God will save me from death.” Moses then said: “When you see the Jews weep for me, will you weep with them?” and his soul replied: “My eye will avoid tears.” “Possibly you will be forced into Gehenna,” Moses said, but his soul answered, “God will save my foot from misstep.” “And where do you expect to go?” Moses further asked, and his soul answered, “I will go before God in the land of the living.”
When Moses heard this, Rabbi Yitzchak concluded, he liberated his soul and said to it: “Go, my soul, to your rest.”<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">דברים רבה פּרשה י״א פּיסקא ב׳, מדרש תנחומא ברכה פּיסקא ב׳.</span></i>
Even more interesting is Rabbi Yitzchak’s explanation of Haman’s accusations against the Jews:
“After Ahasweros decided to give a feast in celebration of the completion of the third year of his reign, Haman appeared before him and said: ‘The Jewish God abhors adultery. You must therefore hire harlots and command all Jews to come to the feast and to gratify their desires.’ When Mordechai heard this, he warned the Jews not to come to the feast since they were invited with the aim of causing them to sin.
“But the Jews disobeyed Mordechai and came to the feast and Satan immediately appeared before God saying: ‘It is time that You destroy this people which always sins against you, but never repents.’
“ ‘I would do so,’ God replied, ‘but what will become of the Torah?’ and Satan said, ‘You can give it to the Creatures of Heaven.’
“God was almost persuaded by this argument and He commanded that a parchment be brought that the decree of annihilation might be recorded. The Torah then appeared dressed in black and weeping bitterly. When the angels saw the Torah mourning, they also wept and said: ‘If the Jews will be destroyed, of what use will we be in the world?’ The sun and the moon, the sky and the earth likewise wrapped themselves in black and mourned. Thereupon Elijah ran and aroused the saints from their graves and said: ‘The sun and the moon are darkened; the sky and the earth are wrapped in mourning; the Torah and the Angels weep and you lie peacefully.’
“ ‘What happened?’ the saints asked and Elijah said: ‘It is decreed to annihilate the Jews.’
“ ‘Is not there even one pious man in this generation?’ Moses asked and Elijah replied: ‘There is one saintly Jew named Mordechai.’
“ ‘Then go to him,’ Moses said, ‘and tell him to pray to God. We will also pray until God will have mercy and He will annul His decree.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מדרש אסתר רבה פּרשה ז׳.</span></i>

Rabbi Aba Kahana and Rabbi Chanina bar Papa

A<small>S WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY POINTED OUT</small>, the political and economic situation of the Jews of Palestine was indescribably tragic at that time. But there seems to have been a constant migration from and into Babylonia. The Roman authorities did not object to the fact that many Jews of Palestine went to Babylonia to seek a livelihood while Babylonian Jews came to Palestine to study. This was the case despite the fact that the Babylonian Jews had by that time attained a higher degree of development of learning. They then enjoyed full liberty in the observance of the religious regulations; they had their own courts and they passed sentences as they saw fit. It was only rarely that they had to consult the High Court in Palestine. The determination of the beginning of the months and of the holidays was the only thing that the Jews of Babylonia could not do. Nevertheless they considered the teachings emanating from Palestine as the only correct ones and they believed that despite the destruction of the Temple the rule that out of Zion would come learning was still sound.
Rabbi Aba bar Kahana was one of the “Amoraim” who came to Palestine from Babylonia at this time. He brought with himself numerous Hagadic interpretations which he repeated in the name of Rav (Aba Arecha).<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי סוטה פרק ט׳ הלכה י״ג, בראשית רבה פּרשה ד׳ פּיסקא ט׳; ויקרא רבה פּרשה ל״ה פּיסקא ט׳.</span></i> Some people therefore claim that he was a disciple of Rav but the dates of the lives of the two men do not coincide and at the time that Rabbi Aba began to study, Rav had undoubtedly died already. It is more probable that Rabbi Aba had been a pupil of a disciple of Rav. This view is also substantiated by the fact that he sometimes quoted Rabbi Chiya bar Ashi who had been a pupil of Rav.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ו׳ הלכה ו׳; שבת פרק ג׳ הלכה ד׳, פרק ו׳ הלכה ה׳, יבמות פרק ד׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i>
When Rabbi Aba bar Kahana arrived in Palestine, Rabbi Chanina bar Chama was probably still alive, for we find him quoting statements in the name of Rabbi Chanina.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קכ״א ב׳.</span></i>
Another reference concerns a question which he asked of Rabbi Ami.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי פּסחים פרק ד׳ הלכה ט׳.</span></i> But we possess little information concerning the personality and the life of Rabbi Aba bar Kahana. On one occasion he mentioned the name of Kfar Chitaa and we may assume that he lived there, but it is unknown whether he conducted a seminary there.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ס״ה פּיסקא י״ב.</span></i>
Like his contemporaries Rabbi Aba was also a master of exposition. The people were then tired of legal disputations, but they responded eagerly to Hagada. We thus find hundreds of expositions of Rabbi Aba. Many of these are not clear for his interpretations of the Biblical verses often seem incomprehensible. We will therefore cite only a few to illustrate his method of interpretation.
Speaking of the verse “the sun rises and the sun sets,” Rabbi Aba said: “What is the intention of this verse? Does not everyone know that the sun rises and sets every day? But this verse intends to show how God conducts the world. Before the sun of Moses set, the sun of Joshua ben Nun rose; the sun of Samuel rose before the sun of Eli set and on the day that Rabbi Akiba died Rabbi Jehuda ha-Nasi was born.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה נ״ח ב׳; קהלת רבה פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא י׳.</span></i>
The verse “if a snake bite without venom”, Rabbi Aba explained in a different manner than the other scholars did. The word <span dir="rtl">״לחש״</span> means both, “venom” and “whisper”. Rabbi Aba interpreted this verse to mean that a snake would not bite unless it had been commanded from above, nor would a lion stalk its prey without heavenly sanction, nor would a government oppress its people unless it was so commanded from above.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קהלת רבה פּרשה י׳ פּיסקא י״ד.</span></i>
Of the effect of a false oath Rabbi Aba said: “Some things which are not consumed by fire are consumed by a false oath. Wood is burned by fire but stones are not, but a false oath will consume both.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ויקרא רבה פּרשה ו׳ פּיסקא א׳.</span></i>
“The slightest command of the Torah”, Rabbi Aba said, “is rewarded as well as the greatest. God thus determined the reward of commandments in order to encourage the people to lead honest lives. The easiest commandment is to send the mother bird away from the nest when the fledglings are taken, in order that it may not suffer the anguish of seeing them killed. The hardest commandment to observe is honoring one’s father and mother. These two commandments are nevertheless rewarded by long life.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי פּאה פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
The following interpretation of a Biblical verse by Rabbi Aba gives a picture of the mood of that time: “The anguish of death has surrounded me” (in Babylonia); “rivers of wickedness have horrified me” (in Media); “the suffering of the grave surrounded me” (among the Greeks); “the traps of death were set for me” (in Rome). The fact that the term “death” was employed in the first and the fourth of these Rabbi Aba explained by saying that both, Babylonia and Rome, undertook to annihilate the Jews; the Babylonians destroyed the first temple and the Romans destroyed the second temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מדרש שוחר טוב פּרשה י״ח.</span></i>
Like many other scholars of that time Rabbi Aba also believed that a war between Babylonia and Rome would result in the liberation of the Jews. He therefore said: “Whenever one will see many Babylonians in Palestine it will be a sign of the approaching redemption.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שיר השירים רבה ה׳ י״א; איכה רבתי א׳ מ״ג.</span></i>
In a discourse concerning the peoples that lived in the neighborhood of Palestine, Rabbi Aba bar Kahana explained the Biblical verse to indicate that the “Pathrothim” and the “Kasluchim” intermarried freely and from these mixed marriages were descended giants like the Philistines and dwarfs like the “Kaphtorim.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ל״ז פּיסקא ח׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Chanina bar Papa was also of great prominence at that time and his name is constantly linked with R. Avahu, R. Yitzchak Napcha and R. Ami. In the Jerusalem Talmud as well as in the Midrashim his first name at times appears as Hinna or Chananiah. The name Papa is an Aramaic form of the Greek name Papos.
Rabbi Chanina bar Papa was a pupil of Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani who praised him for his knowledge of the Scriptures.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שביעית פרק ד׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i> Rabbi Chanina was also a close friend of the outstanding disciples of Rabbi Jochanan and he frequently debated with R. Chama bar Chanina and with R. Acha bar Chanina. The Talmud contains some statements of this time whose authorship is in doubt and these are generally introduced by “R. Zeira said, but others claim that R. Chanina bar Papa said”.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ה׳ א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Chanina par Papa also differed with Rabbi Zeira in the matter of explaining the good deeds of the Israelitic King Abiyah the son of Jeroboam.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ח ב׳.</span></i> The Talmud also cites some of his public lectures but one of these is sometimes ascribed to R. Simlai.
The personality of Rabbi Chanina is surrounded with numerous legendary adventures. One of these relates of an attempt made by a Roman matron to seduce him. When she failed in her attempt, she commanded that Rabbi Chanina be found and he was forced to hide all night in a bath house which was reported to be haunted by evil spirits, but since he did not succumb to sin, he escaped unharmed.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ל״ט ב׳.</span></i> Another time Rabbi Chanina encountered an evil spirit while he was on a mission of charity. The spirit said to him: “Have you not learned that one must not tresspass the boundary of another?”, intending to say that evil spirits are in control at night and that no man should appear outside at that time. But Rabbi Chanina replied: “The Bible says that he who gives charity secretly appeases wrath.” As he said this he turned around and fled.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי פּאה פרק ח׳ הלכה ח׳.</span></i>
When the hour of his death approached, Rabbi Chanina implored the Angel of death to grant him thirty days in which he could review his learning. The Angel of death granted him this request and Rabbi Chanina asked him to show him his place in Paradise and also to let him hold his sword on the way. But the Angel of death refused this last request remembering what had happened when he granted such a request to R. Joshua ben Levi. When Rabbi Chanina died, his body was surrounded by a pillar of fire and none could approach it. Rabbi Alexandri then asked the body to cause the pillar of fire to depart. “Do it for the sake of the scholars who have come to your funeral”, Rabbi Alexandri said, but the pillar of fire did not depart; “do it for the honor of your father”, he continued to implore and still the pillar of fire remained; “do it for your own honor that we may be able to approach to mourn for you and to attend to your burial”. The pillar of fire thereupon vanished.<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ע״ז ב׳.</span></i>
The following of Rabbi Chanina’s maxims are among the most interesting:
“One who is favored with grace is also a God fearing man.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוכה מ״ט ב׳.</span></i>
“One who enjoys something in this world without pronouncing a benediction is like one who robs God and all of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ל״ה א׳; סנהדרין ק״ב א׳.</span></i>
“He who criticizes his master is like one who criticizes the Shechina.”<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ק״י א׳.</span><br>23) <span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה נ״ב ז׳.</span></i>
The verse “the lions roar for prey”, Rabbi Chanina interpreted that lions refer to the unbelieving peoples (<span dir="rtl">כפירים־ כופרים</span>) who deny God and who seek to devour the Jews who depend upon God. God also feeds the poor and the rich alike.<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מדרש שוחר טוב פּרשה ק״ד.</span></i>
Balaam ben Beor was considered by Jews to have been the greatest prophet among Heathen. Rabbi Chanina asked: “What is the distinction between Jewish and Heathen prophets?” He replied that God spoke to Jewish prophets directly as a king who removes the curtains of his palace to speak to his friends. To the Heathen prophets he spoke indirectly as a king who speaks to strangers through a partition.<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה נ״ב פּיסקא ז׳.</span></i>

Rabbi Zeira

N<small>EXT TO</small> R<small>ABBI</small> J<small>OCHANAN</small> there was none among the “Amoraim” concerning whom so many legends were related as were told of Rabbi Zeira. These referred less to his greatness in learning than they did to his unusual personality and to the great friendship which united him with the other scholars who lived in Palestine during the fourth century of the Christian era. Rabbi Zeira came to Palestine from Babylonia when he was already well versed in learning. At the time of his arrival his opinions were already quoted in the academies of Babylonia and various occurrences of his life were being told. Rabbi Zeira was orphaned when he was very young. He was grieved at this and said: “I wish that I had a father and a mother; I would then honor them as much as possible in order to earn a share in the world to come.”
Once he heard it told that when a shoe fell off the foot of Rabbi Tarphon’s mother as she was walking outside, Rabbi Tarphon could not pick up the shoe because this happened during the Sabbath and he therefore placed his hand under his mother’s foot to prevent her from trodding the bare ground, and she thus walked until she reached her bed. The scholars then added that had Rabbi Tarphon done a thousand fold for his mother, he still would not have done even half of what one is supposed to do in order to honor his parents. Later Rabbi Zeira heard it said that the mother of Rabbi Ishmael once came before the scholars to complain that her son was not according her due honor. Greatly shocked they asked the woman what Rabbi Ishmael had done that she had found it necessary to come before them to complain and the woman answered: “Every time that my son comes home from the academy I want to wash his feet and to drink the water, but he would not allow me to do so.” The scholars then said to Rabbi Ishmael: “If this is her desire, you must honor it.”
When Rabbi Zeira heard these stories he exclaimed: “Blessed be the Lord that I have no father and mother for I could not do that which Rabbi Tarphon did and I would not want to do that which Rabbi Ishmael was advised to do.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי קדושין פרק א׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i>
In Babylonia Rabbi Zeira acquired most of his learning from Rabbi Jehudah bar Ezekiel, head of the academy in Pumbeditha.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ל״ט א׳, יבמות ע״ח בי.</span></i> He was also a pupil of Rav Huna<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא ט׳ א׳, ירושלמי שבת פרק ז׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i> and it is possible that he also attended the academy of Rav and Shmuel, although it is likely that the opinions which he quoted in their names he heard from their pupils. It is also known that he studied for a time with Rav Hisda.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ביצה ל״ג ב׳, כתובות צ״ה א׳, ירושלמי שביעית פרק י׳ הלכה ב׳, ערובין פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
It is told that when Rabbi Zeira served his master Rav Huna, he once brought two glasses, one filled with wine and the other with oil, and he carried both glasses in the same hand. Rav Huna’s son then remarked: “Is your other hand cut off that you carry both glasses on one hand?”, and Rav Huna rebuked his son and said: “Is it not enough that a man like Rabbi Zeira is serving you that you also insult him?”<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ח׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Zeira’s yearning for Palestine led him to leave his native land where he enjoyed great honor as a scholar. Before he left Babylonia he fasted one hundred times in order to eradicate from his mind that which he had learned there that it might not confuse his learning in Palestine.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פּ״ה א׳.</span></i> Before leaving, Rabbi Zeira also minutely examined his own conduct to determine whether he was worthy to trod the Holy land. He then had a dream in which he saw barley and this he considered to be an omen that his sins had been forgiven.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות נ״ז א׳.</span></i> Until the day of his departure Rabbi Zeira avoided his teacher Rabbi Jehudah for fear that the latter might forbid his settling in Palestine. Rabbi Jehudah was of the opinion that one who leaves Babylonia of his own will transgresses against Biblical verse which declares that the Jews would be brought to Babylonia and would remain there.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת מ״א א׳.</span></i>
As he approached Palestine, Rabbi Zeira reached a river and in his impatience he did not wait until he would find a boat but he discarded his garments and swam across. A Gentile who heard of this then said to him: “The Jews were always hasty and they remained so to this day. In your haste you could easily have been drowned.” But Rabbi Zeira answered him: “As I was standing at the border of Palestine, I wondered whether I was worthy to enter the land which Moses and Aaron could not enter.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות קי״ב א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Zeira’s arrival made a great impression in the country and he immediately went to greet Rabbi Jochanan.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין נ״ב א׳.</span></i> But his short stature and ungainly appearance earned for him nicknames such as “the black pot”<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה ט״ז ב׳.</span></i> and “the small dark hunchback”.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פּ״ה א׳.</span></i> It was later related that once every month Rabbi Zeira would fire an oven and enter the fire, and that the flames were powerless to harm him. But once he was affected by an “evil eye” and he was scorched by the flames which disfigured him.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ל״ז א׳.</span></i>
Upon his arrival in Palestine, Rabbi Zeira became a close friend of Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדה מ״ח א׳.</span></i> from whom he learned much concerning the regulations pertaining to tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי תרומות פרק י״א הלכה ג׳.</span></i> He thus achieved an old ambition for it was said that while still in Babylonia Rabbi Zeira fasted one hundred times that he might find Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath alive when he would come to Palestine.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פּ״ה א׳.</span></i> His closest friends, however were Rabbi Ami, Rabbi Asi and Rabbi Chiya bar Aba.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין מ״ט ב׳, ק״ז א׳.</span></i> It appears that he knew these men from Babylonia and he merely renewed an old friendship when he met them in Palestine. He was especially anxious to derive as much information as possible from Rabbi Asi, who was by nature an angry man and resented too much questioning.<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא פּ״ד ב׳.</span></i> Nevertheless it is recorded that Rabbi Zeira questioned him whenever he found his explanations unsatisfactory.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ק״ל ב׳.</span></i>
Of Rabbi Chiya bar Aba Rabbi Zeira said: “You may consider it a rule that Rabbi Chiya always repeated the exact opinions of Rabbi Jochanan.”<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ל״ג ב׳.</span></i> Rabbi Zeira himself also scrupulously quoted the names of the scholars whose opinions he repeated.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שבת פרק א׳ הלכה ב׳, קדושין פרק א׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Zeira was also highly regarded by Rabbi Avahu who considered him as his disciple,<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדרים ל״ו א׳, ירושלמי ברכות פרק ח׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i> and when he fell sick, Rabbi Avahu promised to give a feast upon his recovery.<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות מ״ו א׳.</span></i>
When Rabbi Zeira settled in Palestine he hoped to obtain ordination in that country. No ordinations were then being conferred in Babylonia. But in many of his statements he expressed his abhorrence of people who bought their ordination as frequently happened in Tiberias at that time. He would then purposely sit in places where scholars went by and whenever he saw one who, he thought, did not deserve the title of Rabbi, he would ostentatiously remain seated. To all other scholars he accorded due honor.<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות כ״ח א׳, ערובין כ״ח ב׳.</span></i>
Finally Rabbi Zeira obtained his ordination. In Babylonia it was said that he hid for a long time in order to avoid ordination.<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין י״ד א׳.</span></i> On the day that he was ordained, his colleagues sang his praise and the Nasi sent him gifts which he refused to accept. But when he was invited to the Nasi’s table, he accepted the invitation out of respect for the Nasi.<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה כ״ח א׳.</span></i>
By trade Rabbi Zeira was a weaver and he once asked Rabbi Avahu how much effort he might devote to beautifying his cloth without deceiving the buyers with its beauty at the expense of its quality.<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי בבא מציעא פרק ד׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i>
In his time the Roman government prohibited the Jews from engaging in fasts. Rabbi Zeira was greatly worried when he heard of this regulation for he was devoted to fasting as may be seen from the previous description of his prolonged fasts.<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית ט״ז א׳.</span></i>
Because of his conduct Rabbi Zeira was called the “Pious from Babylonia”.<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין קכ״ב א׳.</span></i> He loved peace and he sought every opportunity to effect a reconciliation whenever someone offended him.<sup class="footnote-marker">30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא פּ״ז א׳.</span></i>
The name Zeira was popular in Babylonia at that time. It appears to have been a diminutive endearing form used for children who were born late in the lives of their parents.
Rabbi Zeira’s parents died when he was still young. Of his father it is known that he was a tax collector for the Babylonian government for a period of thirteen years. It was told that he always protected the scholars from too heavy tax burdens.<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין כ״ה ב׳.</span></i> He is also mentioned in connection with scholarly matters when he questioned a regulation of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi.<sup class="footnote-marker">32)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית כ״ו ב׳.</span></i>
On the day that Rabbi Zeira arrived in Palestine, he met a butcher who allowed himself to ridicule him, partly because of his appearance and partly because all Babylonian Jews were exposed to ridicule. Rabbi Zeira seemed to be a subject for mirth in the eyes of the butcher into whose shop he came to buy meat. When he asked the price of the meat the butcher named a sum and said that in addition to this sum the customer must be struck a blow with the hammer. Rabbi Zeira offered a higher price for the meat if he would be spared the blow, but the butcher insisted on his original statement and Rabbi Zeira finally consented.
When Rabbi Zeira came to the academy that evening, he asked the meaning of this custom that every buyer of meat must receive a blow. All those present were surprised when they heard his question and they asked Rabbi Zeira where he had seen such a custom practiced. He then named the butcher and the scholars wished to send for him in order to have him punished for shaming a scholar, but they were informed that the butcher died on that same day. When they heard this, they believed that Rabbi Zeira must have cursed the butcher, but he assured them that he did not curse him and that he believed this to be the custom of the city. The scholars then concluded that Rabbi Zeira must be a very important man if God administered summary punishment to one who had insulted him.<sup class="footnote-marker">33)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ג׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>
The modesty of Rabbi Zeira is further illustrated by the following statement: “If the generations which preceded us were like angels then we are like men; if they were like men then we are like asses.”<sup class="footnote-marker">34)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ב ב׳, ירושלמי שקלים פרק ה׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> He further said that when the Torah spoke of the cure of leprosy it referred to the cure of the flesh. From this he concluded that when one is humble and lowly as the flesh, he would be cured; but one who is proud would never be healed.<sup class="footnote-marker">35)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה ד׳ א׳.</span></i>
Despite Rabbi Zeira’s physical handicaps he always hastened to fulfill all commandments for he had heard it said that in order to fulfill a commandment one may run even during the Sabbath when running is ordinarily forbidden. He thus declared that “the reward for learning is the haste with which one goes to the place of learning.”<sup class="footnote-marker">36)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ו׳ ב׳.</span></i> Another characteristic attribute of Rabbi Zeira was his insistence that the name of the author should always be mentioned when he was quoted. On one occasion he even forced Rabbi Asi to admit that a statement which he had repeated in the name of a certain Amora, he had really heard from a pupil of that Amora.<sup class="footnote-marker">37)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה ל״ו ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Zeira considered the spoken word to be sacred and he insisted that everyone should fulfill his promise. He held it to be especially important to fulfill promises made to children in order that they might not learn to tell falsehoods.<sup class="footnote-marker">38)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוכה מ״ו ב׳.</span></i>
But it is noteworthy that despite the modesty of Rabbi Zeira he demanded that due honor be accorded to scholars and he objected to their self debasement even when that was done during the fulfillment of a commandment. When he saw Rav Shmuel bar Yitzchak at a wedding, dancing before the bride with three torches in his hands which he threw into the air and caught again, Rabbi Zeira remarked: “The old man makes a fool of himself and he also shames us.”<sup class="footnote-marker">39)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות י״ז א׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Zeira did not tolerate the Hagada. At that time there were already numerous books of Hagada extant and he referred to them as “books of witchcraft”. He also commanded one of his pupils to refrain from studying Hagada because he would learn nothing from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">40)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי מעשרות פרק ג׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>
The observance of a commandment was of lesser importance in the eyes of Rabbi Zeira than the beautification of the act and he therefore said that one may spend one third of the cost of fulfilling a commandment in order to make its fulfillment more attractive.<sup class="footnote-marker">41)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא ט׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Zeira stayed in the academy day and night and engaged in study. When he felt weak from overwork he would go to the door of the academy. There he would see scholars coming and going and he would listen to their discourses and he would feel refreshed.<sup class="footnote-marker">42)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות כ״ח א׳, ערובין כ״ח ב׳.</span></i>
A remarkable story is related of Rabbi Zeira and Raba who once became drunk during Purim festivities. While he was intoxicated, Raba killed Rabbi Zeira. On the following day he saw what he had done and he prayed to God and Rabbi Zeira was resurrected. The following year they made no feast for fear that the miracle might not occur a second time if needed.<sup class="footnote-marker">43)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה ז׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Zeira lived to a ripe old age and when his disciples asked him what he attributed his long life to, he said: “I was never angry at anyone in my house and I never ran ahead of one who was greater than myself; likewise I never went a distance of four ells without Torah and phylacteries. I never pondered divine matters in unclean places and I never slept in the academy, not even an accidental nap. I was never glad at the misfortune of others nor did I ever nickname other people.”<sup class="footnote-marker">44)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה כ״ח א׳, תענית כ׳ ב׳.</span></i>
When Rabbi Zeira died he was eulogised in the following words: “Babylonia gave him birth; the Land of Israel reared him as its darling; woe to the city of Tiberias that it had lost its most attractive vessel.”<sup class="footnote-marker">45)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ה בי.</span></i>
The following story is related of Rabbi Zeira’s influence even after his death: “In the neighborhood of Rabbi Zeira’s house there lived some wicked men whom he rebuked for their evil and he prayed to God that they might improve their ways. The other scholars disapproved of this because even as they believed that it was a good deed to rebuke a person who might change his ways so also they considered it a sin to rebuke people who were hardened in sin. After the death of Rabbi Zeira, his wicked neighbors said: ‘Until now the short dark man prayed for us and protected us. Now that he is dead who will pray for us?’ They thereupon repented their sins.”

Volume III; The Amoraim of Babylon and the Babylonian Talmud

Introduction

S<small>EVEN CENTURIES PASSED</small> from the days of the first Tana until the time of the last Amora. This is a long time in the history of any people. No matter how conservative one may be, it would still be impossible to assume that all these years passed without noting profound changes in Jewish life. As was the case with other peoples, these centuries also marked the birth and development of new ideas and concepts among the Jews. Some of these vanished and gave rise to others. These centuries marked far going changes in the political position of the people. Now they were free in their own land, and then they were involved in wars; exile was succeeded by periods of peace and welfare in foreign lands.
After the return from Babylonia, where they lived in an entirely strange environment, the Jews developed new ideas and concepts. The situation in Babylonia itself changed when that country came under the sway of the Persians who possessed an original culture. Later the Jews fell under the domination of the Syrian Greeks and of others. It was quite natural for the Jews to be influenced by these peoples even when they did not imitate them and when they sought to avoid the ways of the pagans. When the conquering nations tried to undermine their belief in one God they did not succeed. The Jews remained steadfast in their faith and were ready to sacrifice their lives for the observance of the Sabbath and of circumcision. The outside influence expressed itself in some modifications in the ceremonial rituals, but the fundamentals of religion were not affected.
As soon as the repatriates from Babylonia were entrenched in the country—after the days of Ezra and Nehemiah—there developed a new attitude toward the Torah. They were convinced that the destruction of the Temple and the exile was a direct result of their negligence in the observance of the commandments of the Torah. They therefore determined to observe scrupulously all the regulations of the Torah. The first measure in this direction was the establishment of a rule that “many students should be maintained”. To achieve this end, many schools were established in all the comers of the land. Whereas the majority of the people had heretofore been farmers and shepherds, it was now sought to transform them into a nation of scholars. The leaders of the schools were called “Soferim”, scribes, whose duty it was to explain the Scriptures and to interpret its teachings. Later the “Soferim” were known as “Chachamim”, wise men. They thus performed a dual function of interpreting and also adapting the Torah to the needs of the time.
The religious and secular life of the people was then governed by two institutions: the Great Court and the Academy, which worked hand in hand and supplemented each other. The entire content of Jewish life centered about these institutions which laid the foundation for the spiritual life of the people. The “Great Court”, later known as the “Sanhedrin”, issued all the decrees and, together with the academies, it became the law giving body which regulated the moral and religious conduct of the people and strengthened its ethical concepts. One of the first activities of the Sanhedrin was the establishment of a “protective fence” (<span dir="rtl">סייג</span>) about the Torah. It was the function of this “fence” to prevent the people from doing any thing which might lead them astray from the commandments of the Torah even when the particular deed had not been prohibited in itself.
Concerned with the moral conduct of the people the scholars sought to prevent any possible lapses by prohibiting men to remain alone with married women in secluded places. In addition to the forms of adultery which the Bible prohibited they also listed 26 types of relatives whom one may not marry.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות כ״א א׳, ירושלמי יבמות פרק ב׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
In the days preceding Ezra and Nehemiah the Sabbath was not strictly observed. The Soferim therefore warned the people concerning its observance and surrounded it with protective barriers. The concept of work was defined in order that people should know what may and what may not be done on the Sabbath. 39 primary occupations were listed the performance of which on the Sabbath was punishable by death. Among these were plowing, sowing, harvesting, threshing, baking, cooking, lighting and putting out fire, hunting, slaughtering animals, writing and erasing, building and destroying, sewing and tearing, carrying objects out of a house and into it.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ע״ג א׳.</span></i>
In addition to these occupations the Soferim prohibited many other activities which did not constitute work in themselves but which lent a weekday atmosphere such as climbing trees, riding on animals, swimming, judging, buying and selling, marriage and others. All of these were forbidden in the interests of complete rest and were also not allowed on the holidays.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ביצה ל״ו ב׳.</span></i>
Tools and vessels which were used during the performance of occupations that were forbidden on the Sabbath, could not be carried out on that day. As a further safeguard the Soferim ruled that the Sabbath was to be observed from sunset on Friday until the sunset on Saturday. Blessings to be pronounced over a glass of wine at the incoming and at the departure of the Sabbath were instituted.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ל״ג א׳.</span></i> A man was likewise appointed to blow the ram’s horn as a signal to the people to cease working. The first blast signalled the field workers to cease their labors; the second one announced to the city workers to close their shops and the third one was a sign to stop all work at home. One more blast was then blown to indicate that the Sabbath had begun.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ל״ה ב׳, קי״ד א׳, סוכה נ״ז ב׳.</span></i>
The first evening of the Passover was consecrated in the same manner as the Sabbath. It partook of the nature of a family celebration and all members of the family gathered to eat of the Paschal lamb, to relate the miracles of the redemption from Egypt and to sing praises. Every Jew, even the poorest, was obliged to drink four glasses of wine on that evening.
In addition to the sacrifices in the Temple, prayers were introduced at that time. It appears that prayer among Jews originated during the Babylonian captivity, when the people had no opportunity to offer sacrifices. Although the forms of the prayers were not yet defined, the idea of praying took root, but it did not supplant the offering of sacrifices which were expressly commanded in the Torah.

The number of Jews who returned to Palestine from the exile in Babylonia was much smaller than the number exiled. But those who remained in Babylonia were no less religious than the ones who returned. The great national struggles which characterized the return to Palestine have never been sufficiently described. We possess inadequate information concerning the time that elapsed from the coming of Ezra and Nehemiah until the rebellion of the Hasmoneans, a period of nearly two centuries. The fate of Zerubabel, who was appointed to govern the Jews of Jerusalem is also unknown.
There exists a tradition, which is not substantiated by any historical evidence, that Zerubabel returned to Babylonia after he became convinced that he could achieve nothing in Palestine. Others claim that he was killed during one of the turbulent periods.
It is certain, however, that a large number of Jews refused to return to Palestine even after the second temple was built and a Hasmonean ruler governed the land. These did not consider their liberation as the expected redemption. They hoped for miracles like those which accompanied the deliverance from Egypt and they awaited a wondrous Messiah from the House of David. They also disapproved of the new temple which lacked the “Urim” and “Thumim”, the Holy Ark and the Cherubim and the “sacred fire”. But the lack of authentic historical information makes it impossible to give a clear description of that time. The writings of Josephus are not entirely clear and the Talmud concerned itself more with describing the customs of the time and interpreting the verses of the Bible rather than with chronicling historical events.
It is therefore impossible to determine how learning began to develop in Babylonia. But we do know that Jewish life developed in that country at the same time that it was making rapid forward strides in Palestine. When the second temple was destroyed, large numbers of Jews sought refuge in Babylonia where the Romans had no control. As often as the political circumstances allowed, there was interchange of scholars between the two countries. Thus we find Rabbi Chiya Raba sending his son, Nathan, to continue his studies in Palestine while Palestinian scholars sent their children to Babylonia. But despite this interchange, the Jews of Palestine nevertheless did not respect the Babylonian Jews. Even Babylonian scholars were ridiculed until their worth was established.
Most of the Jews of Babylonia lived in Nehardea and its environs because it was closest to Palestine. Some even believed that the city was once a part of Palestine and they sought to prove that the surrounding towns were included in the conquests of Joshua. Because of this doubt, the inhabitants of Nehardea celebrated Purim for two days.
The exact location of Nehardea has not been ascertained to this day. All we know is that it was located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and that the lands to the East were settled by non-Jews. Later the Babylonian Jews were compelled to wander farther inland. The persecutions in Palestine forced many scholars to settle in Babylonia and the social and economic conditions in Babylonia also contributed to the establishment of academies in different cities.
Enjoying complete autonomy, the Babylonian Jews were governed by an “Exilarch” who represented them before the government. Like the Nasi in Palestine, the Exilarch also traced his descent from the house of David. At times the Exilarchs were held in even greater respect than the Nasi because they were descended from king David through the male line. At the time that Rabbi Jehudah was Nasi in Palestine, Rav Huna was Exilarch in Babylonia. Rabbi Jehudah once remarked that were Rav Huna to come to Palestine, he would accord him greater honor than he received himself.
When the conditions in Palestine took a turn for the worse, Rabbi Nathan of Babylonia declared that the verse “to those who love me and observe my commandments” (Exodus, 2:6), referred to the Jews of Palestine, who were ready to sacrifice their lives for the sake of the observance of the commandments and who were indifferent to death when they were caught.
These conditions are best illustrated in a Talmudic story which relates that when a Jew, who was condemned to death, would be asked, “Why are you being led to execution?” he would reply, “Because I have circumcised my son.” Another would say, “Because I have studied the Torah.” One led to crucifixion would explain that he was being punished for eating Matzoth, another one that was to be flogged would explain that he incurred his punishment for holding a “Lulav”.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכילתא דבחודש פּרשה ו׳, ילקוט יתרו רצ״ב.</span></i> Under such circumstances, the academies in Palestine were deserted. Those who wanted their sons to gain learning sent them to Babylonia. During such times the scholars of Babylonia would also determine the beginning of the months and the leap years, although this was traditionally the prerogative of the scholars of Palestine.

Judging by the structure of the Babylonian Talmud one might conclude that it is obscure and that its editors compiled its contents without considering sequence. But such a conclusion would be erroneous since every word was carefully weighed and measured before it was included in the Talmud. The Talmud as we have it is a wonderful structure carefully reared from its component parts. The editors of the Talmud followed the system of Rabbi Jehudah in editing the Mishna and not merely did they gather the material but they also sought to integrate it into an organic unit. Rav Ashi and Ravina, the compilers of the Babylonian Talmud, sought to link the subjects treated in the Talmud in a logical sequence. For this purpose they employed a technical terminology which served as a binding cement.
After the period of the “Tanaim” the language of the Talmudic literature was not preserved in its original purity. The early Amoraim still used a language closely resembling that of the Mishna and even some of the latter ones sought to achieve this end. But the majority of their sayings were in Aramaic, which was the ordinary language of the Jews of Babylonia, interspersed with some Hebrew elements. The resulting language did not resemble the language of the Mishna.
The two Talmuds, the Babylonian and the Jerusalem, differ in the language employed and also in their styles. The cause of this is that the methods of interpretation employed in the two countries differed. This is not surprising when we consider the manner in which the interchange of ideas between the two countries occurred. The constant interchange of scholars between the two lands resulted in many errors and quotations were frequently interpreted in a manner foreign to the author. Some scholars even ascribed their opinions to their predecessors in order to lend weight to their words. At other times the authors of various statements were forgotten. Considerable confusion was thus engendered in establishing the authorship of numerous decisions. At times the statements quoted were in direct contradictions to the opinions of the authors. This was especially true of the opinions ascribed to Rav (Aba Arecha). We thus find that when Rabbi Jehuda bar Ezekiel quoted Rav, his brother Rami remarked: “You should not listen to him when he speaks in the name of Rav.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות כ׳׳א א׳, חולין מ״ד א׳.</span></i> Another Amora likewise said: “Whatever Rabbi Jehudah bar Ezekiel says in the name of Rav is incorrect, for Rav had never said it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין ע״ד א׳.</span></i>
Even the compilers of the Talmud at times erred in this respect and they would describe a dispute between two Amoraim in contradicting versions on different occasions. There are several instances of such contradictions.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תוספות מנחות כ״ח ב׳.</span></i>
Some subjects occur both in the Jerusalem and in the Babylonian Talmud with this difference that the Jerusalem Talmud quotes conflicting opinions while the Babylonian Talmud quotes only one opinion.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא ו׳ ב׳, ירושלמי גטין פרק ה׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>

One should not assume that the Talmud is a unified work. The teachings of seven centuries do not readily fuse into a unit. This is particularly true since so many different men of differing tastes shared in its creation. But the Talmud does possess a homogeneous character and it constitutes an integrated work.
In the prefaces to our first two volumes we sought to acquaint the reader with the ideas of the scholars concerning the various problems of life. We shall now supplement those remarks in order to provide a complete picture of their mode of thought. The ideas of our scholars concerning God were original and differed from those accepted among the surrounding peoples. Greek culture which was then highly developed still clung to polytheism. The same was true of the Romans, the Parthians and the Persians. One therefore marvels at the endurance of the scholars and at their success in resisting all attempts to introduce polytheism.
The representation of God in corporeal form such as the phrases “the hand of God” or “the mouth of God” might have indicated, the scholars interpreted as being merely a form of speech used to convey the idea of God to the common people. But they expressly warned against accepting these terms in their literal meaning.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכילתא פּ׳ יתרו.</span></i> They then referred to God in terms which would indicate his superhuman nature. He was called “Shechinah”, (Glory). On other occasions he was referred to as “Gevurah” (Strength) and “Makom” (Place), because He is omnipresent. He was also called “Shamayim” (Heaven), because of the belief that God lived in heaven. The creation of the world they explained to be a process of creation out of nothing. Its aim was the creation of man who was made in the image of God, walking erect and facing heaven. Man is imbued by a soul and possesses a free will to do as he chooses. Of all men the Jews are the chosen ones; the outstanding men among the Jews are the just men.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא ל״ח ב׳.</span></i>
The concept of God’s unity the scholars held to be of the greatest significance. They believed it to be an honor that the Jews followed the only God and that He chose them as His people. The reason why man was created last was explained by them to indicate that man did not share with God in any work of creation.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ל״ח ב׳.</span></i>
God is merciful even when man does not deserve it and His very anger is an expression of his kindness.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים פּ״ו ב׳.</span></i> It is the duty of the Jew to fear God and the life of a Jew should be based on three foundations: study of the Torah; serving God with prayers and charitable deeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק א׳ משנה ב׳.</span></i>
While studying the Torah one should bear in mind that its purpose is to observe the commandments. But the worth of the observance is conditioned by the belief in God who gave the commandments. A Jew must therefore do everything for the sake of God and not merely out of a feeling of duty.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ק״ט ב׳.</span></i>
Faith implies the assumption of the burden of the kingdom of heavens. This implies gratitude to God for the good as well as for the evil and acceptance of his rule presupposes obedience to the rule of God and a conviction that whatever He does is for the best. God should be served with love and one should strive to make His name beloved among all. This will lead to the elevation of the conduct of man to the level of God. Even as God is merciful so also should man strive to be merciful.
Before the introduction of prayers, sacrifices were offered. The purpose of sacrifices was not merely slaughter of animals but elevation of human thought. After the destruction of the Temple one could only assume the vow of a “Nazarite”, not to drink wine and not to cut his hair, or one could undertake fasts to torment his body with lack of food and drink.
Charitable deeds, whether by offering money or through personal effort to aid another, was considered to be the noblest deed possible. This was based on the principle of love for one’s neighbor which was enunciated by Hillel in his rule when he said, “Do not unto others what you would not have done unto yourself.”
Moralizing others on their faults the scholars held to be of great importance and they said that it should be continued until the person corrected becomes angry and is ready to beat his moralist. Such moralizing helps people to avoid gossip, hatred and envy and encourages peace.
One must also believe that God sees all deeds of man, that he knows the needs of the world and that he aids all Jews because of their justice and their faith in Him.
God’s messengers are angels, prophets and saints. The piety of the saint may lead him to become inspired by the holy spirit and he would thus be capable of interceding for the Jews with his prayers. Repentance has a similar effect and protects the penitent from evil.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי פּאה פרק א׳ משנה ב׳.</span></i>
However, the most fascinating element of the faith was the belief in reward and punishment after death. God also credits offspring with the good deeds of their parents. Like the individual, the group also awaits a collective compensation which takes the form of the coming of the Messiah and the resurrection. These matters the scholars discussed tersely when they spoke of the wars of Gog and Magog, the return of the House of David and “the future that is to come” which would compensate the whole nation for their sufferings of the present.
Throughout the years there were numerous sects among the Jews who questioned the authority of the oral law. But none of these doubted the value of the moral teachings of the scholars.
The scholars also believed that God had previously created worlds which he destroyed and when He created the present world He said: “This one finds favor in my eyes while the others did not.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ט׳ פּיסקא ב׳.</span></i>
When God decided to create Adam, the scholars said, He realized that both just and wicked men would be descended from him. Because of the just descendants he wished to create man at once but the prospect of the wicked descendants urged him to annihilate man before he was even created. God thereupon overlooked the future and proceeded to create man.
At first God considered creating man out of heavenly stuff. But realizing that such a creature would incur the envy of the angels who might attempt to harm him, He created man out of a mixture of heavenly and earthly materials.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה י״ב פּיסקא ז׳.</span></i> He then endowed man with a free will to do as he chose. He implanted in him good and evil desires and He gave him the power to control his desires. The scholars were convinced that there was much heroism in subduing one’s evil desires since these are with man since his birth while his good desires manifest themselves only after he reaches the age of thirteen.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין צ״א ב׳.</span></i>
But they did not consider the Torah as the only means against human passions. Piety was held to be a necessary supplement and one who possessed learning without piety was compared to an overseer of a palace who was given the inside but not the outer keys.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ל״א ב׳.</span></i>
The scholars strongly stressed the significance of justice. One who passes just sentence they compared to a partner to God and they interpreted the Biblical verse (Deut. 12:28) to show that good fortune would attend him who practices deeds that are good in the eyes of man and that also find favor in the eyes of God.
If a poor man and a rich man will come to trial, the poor man should not be given preference. He must not be declared just, if he had been unjust, on the ground that the rich man would have to support him anyway. Such judgment would be tantamount to accepting a bribe which blinds even the wisest man. It was also held that bribes could be offered in words as well as in money.<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ק״ה ב׳.</span></i>
Truth is the signature of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת נ״ה א׳.</span></i> Man must therefore make sure that all his utterances should be true. He who is honest is considered to have observed the whole Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכילתא מסכתא דיוסע א׳ כ״ז.</span></i>
Just as God punished the generation of the flood He would also punish anyone who does not abide by his word. One who departs from his word may be compared to one worshipping idols.<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין צ״ב א׳.</span></i> For deceit with words is worse than deceit with money<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא נ״ח ב׳.</span></i> and God abhors the man who speaks otherwise than he thinks.<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים קי״ג ב׳.</span></i> But gossip was held to be even worse than deceit and those guilty of it were considered to be fit to be fed to the dogs.<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים קי״ח א׳.</span></i> Slander, they said, is capable of annihilating all three parties concerned; the one who utters the slander, the one who heeds it and the one who was slandered. Its power extends over long distances and the only reason that the Jews who left Egypt were condemned to perish in the desert was that they heeded slander.<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערכין ט״ז א׳.</span></i>
Four types of people never merit seeing the “Shechinah”: the scornful, those who ridicule others, liars and slanderers.<sup class="footnote-marker">30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה מ״ב א׳.</span></i> There are also numerous types of thieves and the worst of these is the one who deceives people with words; another is the type that invites one to come to his house without really wishing him to do so; the third offers gifts when he is certain that they will not be accepted; the fourth shows merchandise to a customer after that merchandise had already been sold. All of these are compared to swindlers who give false weights and measurements.<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכילתא מסכתא נזיקין י״ג ג׳.</span></i>
The blessings of the Torah, the scholars said, can only be fulfilled when people follow in the ways of God. What are the ways of God? God is gracious to all and he feeds all creatures without exception. People should likewise be kind to each other. God grants health and life to those who believe in him as well as to those who reject Him. People should also forgive acquaintances and strangers.<sup class="footnote-marker">32)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תנא דבי אליהו פרק כ״ו.</span></i>
All of these moral teachings which originated with the explanations of the essence of God ended by scrutinizing social relations. It grew out of the recognition that man is the flower of creation and that God wished man to act justly and kindly. As time went on these teachings expanded in depth and profundity.
Charity was also viewed by the scholars as of great importance. The entire world is provided with food because of charity.<sup class="footnote-marker">33)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות י״ז ב׳.</span></i> One who contributes to charity is worthier than one who offers sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">34)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוכה מ״ט ב׳.</span></i> Charity is the greatest of all commandments<sup class="footnote-marker">35)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא ט׳ ב׳.</span></i> and even the poor man who receives charity should offer some of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">36)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ז׳ ב׳.</span></i> But the scholars also stressed that offering a loan was at times more important than giving charity and aid which one extends with his body may be better than financial aid.<sup class="footnote-marker">37)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ס״ג א׳.</span></i> Scholars were also warned against living in cities which did not have a fund for the poor to which at least two people attended.<sup class="footnote-marker">38)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין י״ז ב׳.</span></i>
One must also love to be preached to for so long as there will be moralizing there will be joy and blessings in the world and evil will depart. The scholars nevertheless warned that one must improve his own ways before he begins to preach to others<sup class="footnote-marker">39)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא ק״ז ב׳.</span></i> and just as it is a good deed to suggest something which will be obeyed even so is it a good deed not to make a suggestion which is sure to be disobeyed.<sup class="footnote-marker">40)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה ד׳ ב׳.</span></i>
The sin of hatred equals in magnitude the commandment to love one’s neighbor. One must not say: “I will love scholars but I will hate their disciples” or “I will love disciples but I will hate rude people”. One may show hatred only to those who deny God and who incite to sin. Thus king David said: “Your enemies I will hate and I will contend with those who rise up against you.”<sup class="footnote-marker">41)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות דר׳ נתן ט״ז ה׳.</span></i> One must also bear in mind what the consequences of hatred will be. Why was the first temple destroyed? Because there existed idol worshiping, immorality and violence. But during the time of the second temple the people observed the Torah and its commandments, why then was it destroyed? It was destroyed because hatred prevailed. We may therefore conclude that hatred is the equivalent of idol worshipping, immorality and bloodshed.<sup class="footnote-marker">42)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא ס׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Speaking of the significance of peace the scholars declared that blessings are of no avail if they are not accompanied by peace.<sup class="footnote-marker">43)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">במדבר רבה פּרשה י״א פּיסקא ט״ז.</span></i> Even in time of war one should think of peace. It is therefore permissible to alter the words of another, when quoting him, in the interests of peace.<sup class="footnote-marker">44)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ס״ה ב׳.</span></i> The stones of which the altar was built and whose function it was to cause peace between Jews and their father in heaven, could not be hewn by any iron implement. It was therefore concluded that one who brings about peace between man and wife, between one city and another, between one nation and another or between one family and another, would not meet with any harm. One must therefore heed the command to preserve peace and not to engage in quarrels. Such great significance was attached to peace that it was believed that even when people worship idols they could not be harmed by enemies if they lived in peace among themselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">45)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ספרי נשא פּרשה מ״ב.</span></i>
Marriage was held to be the most important event in the life of any man. It was considered to be the duty of every Jewish man to participate in the increase of the people. This conviction, together with the natural fertility of the Jewish women, contributed to the survival of the people throughout the period of persecution. No man even thought of avoiding this responsibility toward his people. Thus Rabbi Akiba once asked, “Who may be considered a rich man?” and he replied that a rich man is one “who has a wife noted for her good deeds.”<sup class="footnote-marker">46)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת כ״ה ב׳.</span></i> Ben Sira was also quoted as saying that “a good woman is the best gift. Happy is the husband of such a woman; the days of his life are doubled.”<sup class="footnote-marker">47)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ס״ג ב׳.</span></i> The verse which declared that the days of the poor were evil, the scholars interpreted as referring to a man who has a wicked wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">48)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא קמ״ח ב׳.</span></i> Man was also commanded to honor his wife for the blessing of one’s house was entirely dependent upon the wife,<sup class="footnote-marker">49)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא נ״ט א׳.</span></i> and he who honored his wife more than himself and loved her even as he loved himself would be blessed with peace and plenty.
Amicable relations between man and wife caused the “Shechinah” to dwell in the house and when discord prevails, they are both consumed as by a fire.<sup class="footnote-marker">50)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה י״ז א׳.</span></i> Another scholar explained the significance of peace in a still different manner. He said: The Hebrew words <span dir="rtl">״איש״</span> and <span dir="rtl">״אשה״</span> (man and woman) contain two of the letters of the name of God and God would preserve them from all evil. But this is true only so long as they live in peace. As soon as they leave the ways of peace, these two letters are withdrawn and only the letters <span dir="rtl">״אש״</span> remain. These signify fire which would consume them.<sup class="footnote-marker">51)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פרקי דרבי אליעזר פּרשה י״ב.</span></i>
The education of the children naturally occupied a prominent place under the circumstances. Study of the Torah was the central theme of this training. One of the scholars declared that as soon as a child learns to talk his father should teach him the Hebrew language and the Torah and any father who does not do so may be compared to a father who kills his child.<sup class="footnote-marker">52)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ספרי פּרשת עקב פּיסקא מ״ו.</span></i> But one who obeys this commandment is credited with teaching his descendants to the end of all generations.<sup class="footnote-marker">53)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ל׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Speaking in the same vein the Tana Rabbi Jochanan declared that of the three types of people who deserve a share in the world to come one is the father who raises his children in the ways of the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">54)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים קי״ג א׳.</span></i> The entire world exists because of the breath of children at study and they must therefore not be disturbed from their studies even when the temple is to be rebuilt. Any city in which the voices of children at study is not heard will certainly be destroyed in the end.<sup class="footnote-marker">55)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ט ב׳.</span></i> It was thus related that every child which had a father would be taught by him, but fatherless children remained uneducated. It was therefore ordered that schools be established in every city and every province where children were brought at the age of six or seven years. No children began their studies before they reached the age of six.<sup class="footnote-marker">56)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא כ״א ב׳.</span></i>
Rabbi Jose declared that every man is obligated to study and none should assume that he will inherit his learning. Another scholar therefore said that one should beware of the children of the poor for they might grow to be great students.<sup class="footnote-marker">57)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדרים פּ״א א׳.</span></i> The same attitude should be maintained toward the children of the Ame Aratzim for they too might become scholars.<sup class="footnote-marker">58)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין צ״ו ב׳.</span></i> Parents were also enjoined to teach their children trades and any parent who did not do so was considered on par with one who taught his son to be a robber.<sup class="footnote-marker">59)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין כ״ט א׳.</span></i>
Learning a trade was held to be of great importance. Not only did a trade provide one with a livelihood but it also brought him honor. The importance of a man who lived off the practice of a trade was held to be equal to that of a pious man.<sup class="footnote-marker">60)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ח׳ א׳.</span></i> In the opinion of Rabbi Gamliel, the son of Rabbi Jehudah, that knowledge of the Torah which was not accompanied by the practice of a trade was of no value and was sure to lead to sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">61)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק ב׳ משנה ב׳.</span></i>
Both parents as well as God share in the creation of a human being. As long as one honors his father and mother God therefore considers it as He had been honored.<sup class="footnote-marker">62)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ל׳ ב׳.</span></i> Another time the scholars declared that it is more important to honor one’s father and mother than it is to honor God. Man is thus obligated to fulfill the commandments concerning a Succa, a Shofar, feeding the poor and others only if he can afford to do so; but the commandment to honor one’s parents must be fulfilled under all circumstances.<sup class="footnote-marker">63)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי פּאה פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> When the question arose how one should honor his parents and whether one could do so by word of mouth only the scholars invoked the verse “Honor God from your wealth” and they declared that one must honor his parents with all his possessions, with food and with garments. The honor due to one’s father they further explained by saying that one might not stand in the place of his father nor sit in his seat nor contradict his words nor side with his opponents.<sup class="footnote-marker">64)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ל״א ב׳.</span></i>
The scholars also interpreted the Biblical commandment to prove that one is obligated to honor his step-mother in the same measure as he would honor his own mother; his step-father in the same measure as he would honor his own father and also his older brothers and his father in law.<sup class="footnote-marker">65)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכילתא מסכתא דוישמע יתרו פּרשה מ׳ פּיסקא ז׳.</span></i>
But not only parents were to be accorded honor. Scholars were to be granted the same respect<sup class="footnote-marker">66)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים כ״ב ב׳.</span></i> and greeting a scholar was equivalent to greeting the Shechinah.<sup class="footnote-marker">67)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכילתא יתרו פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא י״ב.</span></i> The honor due to the Torah was so great that a bastard who was a scholar was ranked higher than a High Priest who was an Am Haaretz.<sup class="footnote-marker">68)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">הוריות י״ג ב׳.</span></i>
Modesty was also a virtue which the sages praised highly and Rabbi Levitas of Jabneh said: “One should be very humble for there is no real reason for pride considering that in the end all men will be consumed by worms.”<sup class="footnote-marker">69)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק ד׳ משנה ד׳.</span></i> One who is humble, other scholars declared, will be raised by God and one who is proud will be put to shame. It is likewise with one who seeks greatness that greatness eludes him but one who avoids it will certainly achieve greatness.<sup class="footnote-marker">70)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין י״ג ב׳.</span></i>
Modesty is a quality of God. When He appeared to Moses the first time He did not appear in the form of a proud cedar tree but in the form of a lowly bush. When He gave the Torah to the Jews He did so from Sinai which is small compared to the great mountains.<sup class="footnote-marker">71)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה ה׳ א׳.</span></i> God therefore declares that He will avoid those who are proud and one who walks erect with pride crowds the feet of the Shechinah.<sup class="footnote-marker">72)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות מ״ג ב׳.</span></i>
Satisfaction with one’s lot was equal in importance to modesty. “Who is a wealthy man?” asked the Tana Ben Zoma, “he who is satisfied with his share.”<sup class="footnote-marker">73)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">אבות פרק ד׳ משנה א׳.</span></i> For one should be content with that which he has. Rabbi Akiba further clarified this idea when he said that “one should arrange his Sabbaths like week days in order to avoid being dependent on charity.”<sup class="footnote-marker">74)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ח ב׳.</span></i> One way of attaining such a state of contentedness is by avoiding gluttony.<sup class="footnote-marker">75)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא צ״ב א׳.</span></i> At the same time the scholars ruled that one should not deny himself the pleasures of life and Rav (Aba Arecha) declared that any man who denies himself joys which he can attain will have to account for it in the world to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">76)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי קדושין פרק ד׳ הלכה י״ב.</span></i>
One must avoid mutilating his body.<sup class="footnote-marker">77)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא צ״א ב׳.</span></i> There is also no action which may not be performed nor is there any food which may not be eaten in order to preserve an endangered life with the exception of idolatry, bloodshed and immorality for the avoidance of which one must be ready to sacrifice his life.<sup class="footnote-marker">78)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא פּ״ב א׳.</span></i> Regarding the observance of the Sabbath Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said that it may be desecrated for the sake of a living day old child, but not for the sake of a dead king David.<sup class="footnote-marker">79)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קנ״א ב׳.</span></i> Rabbi Menasia liekwise said that the Sabbath was given to people to observe but the people were not given to the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">80)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכילתא מסכתא דשבת פּרשה א׳.</span></i>
Bashfulness and chastity were likewise held in great esteem, and these qualities were considered to be the outstanding merit of the Jews.<sup class="footnote-marker">81)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדרים כ׳ א׳.</span></i> It was believed that shame leads to avoidance of sin while arrogance leads to transgression. Scholars were warned to heed their behavior.<sup class="footnote-marker">82)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מסכת דרך ארץ זוטא פרק ו׳.</span></i>
Regarding faith and dependence on God it was said that Jews deserve to have miracles performed for their sake because of their unbounded faith.<sup class="footnote-marker">83)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכילתא מסכתא דבשלח פּרשה ג׳.</span></i> He who trusts in God would be protected by Him both in this and in the coming world.<sup class="footnote-marker">84)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מנחות כ״ט ב׳.</span></i> On another occasion it was declared that a penitent is credited with making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and offering sacrifices there. When Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus enjoined his disciples to repent one day before their death, they questioned how one may know when he would die and Rabbi Eliezer explained that one must repent daily for fear that he would die on the morrow.<sup class="footnote-marker">85)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קנ״ג א׳.</span></i>
Prayer ranked close upon repentance and was held to be of greater value than sacrifices. Its significance was so great that at least half of one’s prayers were certain to be granted.<sup class="footnote-marker">86)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">דברים רבה פּרשה ה׳ פּיסקא א׳.</span></i> Another sage said that even were a sword to be at one’s throat he should still feel confident in prayer.<sup class="footnote-marker">87)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות י׳ א׳.</span></i>
Some Gentile pedagogues of that time declared that it is better for children to study at home, each one separately. Our scholars, on the other hand, believed that group study tended to develop the minds of children. We find no mention, however, that even the Gentile pedagogues should question the efficiency of schools for their usefulness was recognized by all. We may therefore assume that only a few held to this point of view. It was only a small number of wealthy Gentiles that could afford to maintain a private tutor for their children. Children of the poor largely remained without any education which was looked upon as a privilege of the rich.
The educational situation among the Jews was entirely different. Education was democratic and so organized that the whole people benefited from it. Classes were not always held indoors and frequently study would take place in the street. Thus we find that Rabbi Jehudah prohibited teaching in the street and when Rabbi Chiya taught his two sons outside the house he incurred the displeasure of Rabbi Jehudah.<sup class="footnote-marker">88)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן ט״ז ב׳.</span></i> Such study as took place outside involved adult pupils mostly and was practiced during unusual circumstances. Otherwise all learning took place in the synagogues where prayers were also said. There were no convenient structures for schools at that time. Since the people were impoverished it was said that not much money should be spent even for synagogues.
At first all learning was engaged in while standing. Later it became customary to sit. The teacher would then be seated on a rock or on a bench while his pupils sat on the ground around him. The Talmud declared that since the days of Moses until the time of Rabban Gamliel the old people studied while standing but that after the death of Rabban Gamliel maladies afflicted the world and people were forced to sit while studying.<sup class="footnote-marker">89)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה כ״א א׳.</span></i>
Special furniture for the adornment of the schools was not needed at that time. If the teacher sat on a couch his pupils also reclined on couches. Teachers were also prohibited from benefiting from the services of their pupils. Thus we find that Rabbi Jehudah was in the habit of carrying his own bench to the academy.
The seating of the pupils was ordered in such manner that the teacher should be able to see the faces of all; they were then seated in a semi-circle. Of the influence of facing one’s teacher while at study we learn from the remark of Rabbi Jehudah who complained that he could not always see the face of his master Rabbi Meir and that this fact hindered his proficiency in learning.<sup class="footnote-marker">90)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין י״ג ב׳.</span></i> Another sage instructed his pupils to seat themselves in such a manner as to be able to see the mouth of their teacher when he was teaching them.<sup class="footnote-marker">91)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">הוריות י״ג א׳.</span></i>
It was the accepted rule that children should start their schooling at the age of six. One Amora warned that study at an earlier age may affect the health of the child adversely. Others said that it would also affect his intellectual development. But the most common suggestion offered was that the physical development of each individual child should be considered.<sup class="footnote-marker">92)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות נ׳ א׳.</span></i>
We find no record of the required qualifications for teachers but we may assume that they were required to be well acquainted with the subject of instruction. The qualities that were enumerated for scholars were probably also required of teachers.
A popular maxim of that time declared: “In my native city I am known by my name but in a strange city I am known by my clothes.”<sup class="footnote-marker">93)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קמ״ה ב׳.</span></i> It was likewise said that a scholar who wears spotted clothes deserves to forfeit his life and that it is a shame for a scholar to wear patched shoes.<sup class="footnote-marker">94)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ד א׳.</span></i> Scholars were also warned to heed their habits of eating and drinking and one who arranged his feasts without choosing a proper place would forget his learning, he would cause quarrels and his words would not be heeded.<sup class="footnote-marker">95)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים מ״ט א׳.</span></i>
Not all teachers were considered capable of teaching as not all pupils were capable of learning. But the blame was mostly ascribed to the teachers and Rava once declared: “If you see a pupil having difficulties in learning, it is a proof that his teacher does not show him friendliness.”<sup class="footnote-marker">96)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית ה׳ א׳.</span></i>
Every scholar must consider it to be his duty to teach others without compensation. But since teachers were required to devote their whole time to their work some form was devised to provide for their needs. Thus the Talmud declares that he who studies without teaching others may be compared to a plant in the desert<sup class="footnote-marker">97)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה כ״ג א׳.</span></i> and he who refrains from teaching a law to his pupil is like one who robs him.<sup class="footnote-marker">98)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין צ״א ב׳.</span></i>
According honor to one’s teacher was therefore held to be of greater importance than honoring one’s father.<sup class="footnote-marker">99)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">הוריות י״ג א׳.</span></i> Should one see his father and his teacher carrying loads, he was to help his teacher first. Likewise if one’s father and teacher are imprisoned he was to ransom his teacher first.<sup class="footnote-marker">100)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">100) בבא מציעא ל״ג א׳.</span></i> One who contradicts his teacher may be compared to a man contradicting the Shechinah<sup class="footnote-marker">101)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">101) סנהדרין ק״י א׳.</span></i> and walking on the right side of one’s teacher indicated rudeness.<sup class="footnote-marker">102)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">102) יומא ל״ז א׳.</span></i>
Respect for one’s neighbor was likewise commanded and it was to equal the respect in which one holds himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">103)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">103) אבות פרק ב׳ משנה י״ג.</span></i> A man who was known to be superior even in one respect deserved to be honored.<sup class="footnote-marker">104)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">104) פּסחים ק״ג ב׳.</span></i> One’s position was entirely irrelevant in this respect, for a man brings honor to his position and not vice versa.<sup class="footnote-marker">105)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">105) תענית כ״א ב׳.</span></i>

Rav; Abba Arecha

A<small>FTER THE PERIOD OF THE</small> “T<small>ANNAIM</small>” the first important figure in the period of the “Amoraim” is that Amora who is known not by his name but by his title “Rav”.
His name was Abba, and he was called by some “Abba Arecha” (Long Abba), because he was the tallest man of his generation.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדה כ״ד ב׳.</span></i> It is possible also that “Arecha” was the name of Rav’s birthplace in Babylon.
His title “Rav” was the same as that of all his successors who were allowed by the “Resh Galuta” (the ruler of the Jewish Diaspora in Babylon), to preside over their own academy. Just as R. Jehudah ha-Nasi was called “Rabbi”, omitting his own name, so Abba Arecha was always called “Rav”.
It was Rav who founded the academy in the city of Sura. The ruler of Babylon at that time was the Persian king Artaban who was very friendly to the Jews and a great admirer of Rav. Rav’s academy quickly attracted over a thousand students from far and near.
Abba Arecha was born in the year 155 C. E. When he founded his academy which existed thereafter for seven centuries he was a man of 64. His family was of aristocratic stock and highly respected among scholars. By marriage he was related to the family of the “Resh Galuta” of Babylon, which was an even more important lineage than that of the “Nasi” in Palestine, because the family of the “Resh Galutha” (the “Exilarch”) derived from king David in the paternal line and the “Nasi” was descended from David only in the maternal line.
R. Jehudah Hanasi himself once admitted this when he said: “If Rab Huna, Resh Galuta, should ever come to Palestine, I will seat him higher than myself because he is descended from the tribe of Judah and I from the tribe of Benjamin, and in addition he is related to king David in the paternal line while I am related to king David only in the maternal line.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי כתובות פּדק י״ב הלכה ג׳, בראשית רבה פּרשה ל״ג פּיסקא ג׳.</span></i>
An uncle of Rav, R. Chiya Raba, owned a genealogical record which showed him to be descended from Shefatiah, a son of king David by his wife Abital.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית ד׳ ב׳, בראשית רבה פּרשה צ״ח פּיסקא י״ג.</span></i> To be sure, there is a quotation to the effect that it was R. Jehudah Hanasi who was descended from Shefatiah, and that R. Chiya derived from Shimi, a brother of David.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ס״ב ב׳.</span></i> But we have the personal statement of R. Jehudah Hanasi, which we quoted above, against this source.
It should be stated, also, that Rav’s family tree had wide connections and a great number of scholars were found in it in later generations.
Rav’s father was called Ibo ben R. Acha Karsela of Kafri. He was only a half-brother of R. Chiya Raba. R. Chiya’s mother had a daughter by a former husband named “Imma” and Rav’s father married this daughter of his step-mother. Consequently R. Chiya had the same father as Rav’s father and the same mother as his mother.
This relationship had a great influence upon the course of Rav’s life, for he was always with R. Chiya. He was brought up in his home, and when R. Chiya went to Palestine, Rav accompanied him. And just as R. Chiya was Rav’s teacher in Babylon, so he continued to teach him in Palestine. On the other hand Rav supervised all of R. Chiya’s business and had a hand in everything he did.
R. Chiya took care of Rav so devotedly because he was his sister’s son. It seems that our scholars at that time held that it was every man’s duty to take an interest in his sister’s son. And even though Rav was R. Chiya’s brother’s son, which should perhaps have been more important because they were sons of the same father, R. Chiya called him always “my sister’s son” and other scholars did likewise.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ה׳ א׳, בראשית רבה פּרשה ל״ג פּיסקא נ׳.</span></i>
Rav and R. Chiya showed great similarity in their way of living and their character, which demonstrates the influence of R. Chiya in Rav’s life, and in his aims and the ideals of his academy, as well as those of his descendants and pupils.
Many of Rav’s remarks and the utterances of his pupils are preserved only in the Jerusalem Talmud, because before he founded his academy in Sura, many of his greatest pupils and their pupils left Babylon and emigrated to Palestine where they spread the wisdom of their teacher.
Out of the great respect of the scholars of that time for Rav, many would send their children to him to be blessed.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן ט׳ ב׳.</span></i> Since his views were often opposed to those of the Mishnah, people said about him: “Rav is a Tanna, but a dissenter,” that is even though he might have been counted as a Tanna of the Mishnah, he differed from them nevertheless in his opinions.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין נ׳ ב׳, כתובות ח׳ א׳, גטין ל״ח ב׳, בבא בתרא מ״ב א׳.</span></i>
As we have said, Rav was related by marriage to the Exilarch. They were equals in status. After them the family ramified very widely and most of the scholars until the last generations of “Amoraim” were descendants of their family. When Rav once put a question concerning human conduct to R. Chiya, R. Chiya called him <span dir="rtl">״בר פּחתי״</span> (Son of Aristocrats).<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות י״ג ב׳, שבת ג׳ בי.</span></i>
Once in speaking about the great leaders of the Jews, Rav said, that every generation must have three such leaders, sometimes two of them in Babylon and one in Palestine and sometimes two in Palestine and one in Babylon. The Talmud relates that the scholars who heard him turned their eyes toward his grandsons, his daughter’s children, Rabana Ukba and Rabana Nehemiah, of whom we know only that they were the students of R. Chisda, signifying that these were the two great leaders whom the Jews needed in Babylon.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין צ״ב ב׳.</span></i>
Rav laid great stress on the matter of lineage. A student quoted him as saying that the verse about the descendants of Asher, calling them chosen warriors, chiefs of the captains, (Chronicles I, 7:40) and signifying their standing in the army and the battlefield was written so that their reputation and prestige of the ancestors might protect them in battle.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ע״ו ב׳.</span></i>
This was the general attitude of Rav’s family in the question of lineage. Another of Rav’s students quoted him as saying that “since genealogical records have been lost, scholars have lost their ability and the light of their eyes has been extinguished.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים ס״ב ב׳.</span></i>
In spite of its high place Rav’s family used to conduct themselves very modestly and they had a marked tendency to make friends among all classes of people. Rav himself did not discriminate among his friends because of position and would try to make friends with men of lower origin. It was characteristic of Rav’s family to respect the dignity of women more than had been customary among Jews. This tendency is best seen in his legal decisions limiting the rights of a father with regard to his daughter and of a brother with regard to his orphaned sister.
Women were mentioned by their own names in his family, like “Judith”, R. Chiya’s wife, “Pazi” and “Tabi”, R. Chiya’s daughters, “Imma”, Rav’s mother. It is probable that this custom of calling women by their own names was the rule in the homes of the Jewish aristocracy, the “Nasi” in Palestine or the “Resh Galuta” in Babylon, because the other women who are mentioned by name in the Talmud or in the Midrashim were also of the same family, like “Yalta”, the wife of R. Nachman of Nehardea, or “Chova”, the wife of R. Huna.
This family also followed the custom of naming children after dead parents and near relations, as was the custom of aristocratic Gentiles of that time, as well as of the “N’siim” in Palestine and the “Resh Galuta” in Babylon.
Various customs of an extraordinary sort were prevalent in this family because of common ideals or the influence of ancient traditions. Such, for instance, was their love for the education of the younger generations. All the members of Rav’s family took a broad interest and had a fine understanding of the problems of education and devoted to it all their time and energy.
These people also had an accent different from that of others. In general, their accent was similar to that of the “Galileans”; like them they slurred the “gutturals” in their speech and obscured the differences between them. They would use an “h” where it was not written and omit it where it was needed, had difficulty in pronouncing the <span dir="rtl">ע׳</span> and jumbled the sounds of the letters <span dir="rtl">זסצ״ש</span>.
When R. Chiya once told R. Shimeon bar Bari that if R. Shimeon were a “priest” it would be wrong to permit him to give the blessings from the pulpit, because he had a hoarse voice, R. Shimeon’s father said to tell R. Chiya that he himself should not even be permitted to read from the Bible in the synagogue because he spoke indistinctly and he could not pronounce the <span dir="rtl">ח׳</span> correctly.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה כ״ב ב׳.</span></i>
Rav was a strong and healthy man and of a healthy family.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין פּ״ד א׳.</span></i> This is clear also, if one considers what he suffered during his life, how much wandering he did and what he did for Jews by personal intercession. In spite of all his troubles he lived a long time and reached a great age in perfect soundness of body and mind. He had a penetrating eye for people and events. He understood the central importance of every event and weighed everything accurately.
He was also a great student of nature and loved to observe the course of the stars and to investigate the behavior of all sorts of creatures. He made friends gladly with shepherds and hunters because he saw that their company could enrich his knowledge. He used to listen to their proverbs with great curiosity because it was his way to consult everybody’s opinion.
Being interested in human needs, Rav was always aware of the limits of human capacities. Thus he was interested in the differences of character in the cities which Jews inhabited at that time and tried to discover the differences in their essential nature. For this reason he was called <span dir="rtl">״גבר בכולא״</span> meaning that he was great in every sort of knowledge.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין נ״ד א׳.</span></i>
When teaching his students, Rav would keep close watch on all their expressions. He knew just how attentive each one was at any time. Whenever his eye caught any student behaving strangely, he would want to know the reason immediately, whether the student was worrying about some personal difficulties at home.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי נדה פרק א׳ הלכה ג׳, בראשית רבה פּרשה ב׳ פּיסקא י״ד.</span></i> With his deep instinct Rav could sense a student’s secret meaning through the intonation of his words. Thus he was once incensed when he saw his pupil R. Cahana dressing his hair during class, because he felt that it was distracting his attention from study.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין קי״א א׳.</span></i>
Endowed with varied abilities and many-sided knowledge, he was also a great statesman and a man of practical affairs. He spent much effort in settling Jews in Sura where he founded his academy. At the same time he managed his own large weighing business and the enterprises of his uncle R. Chiya. He built toll bridges and dealt in wheat and other goods. On certain occasions he also served as Judge and in addition he composed a large number of prayers for the holidays. Since his voice was good, he was also a <span dir="rtl">„פּוסק סדרא״</span> (a reader in the synagogue), as well as a <span dir="rtl">״מתורגמן״</span> (a translator).<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא כ׳ ב׳.</span></i> Only a person with a melodious voice could be chosen for this position.<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קהלת רבה פּרשה ז׳ פּיסקא י״ב.</span></i>
In many of his ways Rav imitated his uncle R. Chiya, of whom it was told that he once hired mule-drivers to bring him some flax. They brought him damp wares which he could not use. R. Chiya said to Rav, “Go out and give them their wage. But tell them I am paying them not because I must, but because I do not choose to insist on my rights.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי בבא מציעא פרק ו׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
A similar occurence once happened to Rav. His widowed daughter-in-law came to him to demand that her marriage portion be given to her. He told her, “If I were not an open-handed person I would tell you that even the small adornments you wear on your head belong to me.”<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי גטין פרק ד׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
Generous himself, Rav always watched other people to see which ones gave freely and which were stingy. His own lavish charity often seemed to him to be “wasteful”, and in order to have some control over his expenditure, he instructed his agent that whenever he was ordered to give a person some gift which he—the agent—did not think the recipient needed, he was to consult Rav a second time before making the payment.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי בבא מציעא פרק ד׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>
In spite of the accepted rule that a student must not express his opinion in the presence of his teacher, Rav gave his students full permission to decide legal cases and instruct pupils to the extent of their ability. He would often take many of his pupils to judge cases with him. He said, “A man may teach a student and at the same time have him act as an associate judge in his court.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ל״ו א׳.</span></i> In the same vein he said, “If a student is capable of teaching others and he does not do so, it is as bad as murder.”<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה כ״ב א׳.</span></i> On another occasion, he said, “Whoever prohibits his students from practicing any commandments is as bad as if he robbed him of his inheritance.”<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין צ״א ב׳.</span></i>
Rav wished to be kind to everybody and thought better of people than they deserved. He also loved truth and tried to speak only the truth even when it brought him personal harm. It is said that his wife used to torment him because she never would cook what he wanted to eat. When his son Chiya was grown up he used to bring his mother his father’s orders for each meal. He used to change his father’s orders in repeating them to his mother, so that she gave him just what he wanted while trying to give him the opposite of what he had asked for. Once Rav said to his son, “It seems to me that your mother is getting better.” “I am to blame for that,” answered Chiya. His father understood that the son had twisted his orders to his mother, so that he would get what he wanted. This disturbed him and he said, “Nevertheless, you mustn’t do it any longer, because you create a tangle of lies.”<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ס״ג א׳.</span></i>
Rav’s colleagues and students sometimes caught him contradicting what he had said on another occasion. When they would bring it to his attention he would be silent, not answering until he thought the matter out. In such cases the Talmud says, “Rav was silent.” Even in other instances when Rav had a difference of opinion with some other scholars, he would be silent very often, and since he considered that not allowing oneself to be drawn into a dispute to be a mark of a high-born family, he said: “The silence of Babylon is its nobility.”<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ע״א ב׳.</span></i>
Nevertheless he was frequently violently angry. Sometimes a matter did not seem to bother him for a long time, and all at once the same thing would make him burst out in a fury of rage.
Thus he was once reading from the Bible in R. Jehudah Hanasi’s synagogue. While he was in the midst of his reading, his uncle R. Chiya came in and he began over again for him. Later R. Jehudah Hanasi’s son came in and he began all over again once more. Afterwards Bar Kapara came in and he had to begin all over once more. Thus he had to begin reading the same chapter of the Bible three times. To cap the climax R. Chanina entered and asked him to begin the reading again. At this he burst out in anger, “How often do I have to begin reading from the beginning?”
His anger was only momentary, however, for when he had time to consider he hastened to seek out the one whom he had “insulted” and apologized to him; and—as the story goes—R. Chanina refused to accept his apology. For thirteen years after that Rav went to R. Chanina on Yom-Kippur-eve to apologize for the insult offered and it did no good. Another story relates that Rav had an argument with a butcher who also refused to accept his apology.<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא פּ״ז א׳.</span></i>
A similar incident occurred when Rav acted as an interpreter for Rav Shila. In the course of the lecture Rav translated one word differently from Rav Shila’s wish, even though Rav Shila had told him expressly how to translate, and in spite of the rule that “when one works for another he must even wash his wet wool.”<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא כ׳ ב׳.</span></i>
In his anger Rav would sometimes utter a curse. Once the municipal judge annoyed him with childish questions, and Rav wished that he might grow a horn out of his eyes. Another time Samuel of Nehardea took him to his house and gave him food that spoiled his digestion, and for that Rav said that he hoped he would never have any children.<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ק״ח א׳.</span></i>
The slightest reflection on his honor would often infuriate him. But even more than of his own honor he was touchy and jealous of the honor of the Bible and of the Jewish faith. He would curse people who allowed themselves to do things which other scholars declared were forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ק״כ ב׳.</span></i> He once cursed a man who planted a tree during Purim.<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה ה׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Because Rav often withdrew what he had previously said, it was an accepted rule that “sometimes he said yea and sometimes nay.” Many of his opinions are related by different students in dissimilar versions not because the students introduced differences in their quotations, but because he himself changed his formulation.
In general Rav believed that any person might change his mind about a matter while dealing with it, and he stated a rule that “when a person began an action conditionally and stopped it unconditionally we may assume that he had abandoned his original intention.”<sup class="footnote-marker">32)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ע״ב ב׳.</span></i> When a merchant once complained that he had been cheated in the price of some goods that he had sold, he told the “cheated” merchant that he was probably fully aware of the fact at the time and nevertheless he had accepted the lower price because he needed money, and therefore his present change of mind could do him no good.<sup class="footnote-marker">33)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא נ״א א׳.</span></i>
Rav went to Palestine from Babylonia twice. The first time was during a strong wave of migration of the Babylonian Jews. For some reason everybody there was seized with a sudden hankering to wander. Economic conditions in Babylonia were normal at the time and there was no pressing need for anyone to leave the country. But the reports from Palestine were bad, and it seemed to the Jews in Babylonia that the Torah was sinking into oblivion in Palestine, and they had to go there in masses in order to revive its study. At that time there came to Palestine people of energy, strong will, and warm hearts. Their presence brought about a revival of life. The seat of the “Nasi” was occupied at the time by R. Jehudah, the “editor” of the Mishnah. And still there must have been something wrong if the Talmud later said that “when the Torah had been forgotten in Palestine, R. Chiya came with his children and they revived it.<sup class="footnote-marker">34)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוכה ב׳ א׳.</span></i>
This R. Chiya was Rav’s uncle, as we have already said, and when he went to Palestine he took along with him his two sons, Hezekiah and Judah, his brother’s son Rabah bar Chana, his colleagues R. Chanina bar Chama, R. Simlai, and our Rav. It seems that all these scholars were descendants of ancestors who fled from Palestine during the persecutions of Hadrian or perhaps during later persecutions. They all kept together in Babylonia and together they returned to Palestine.
At that time everybody felt the need to continue the systematization of the Jewish faith through the principles of the “Mishnah” and Rav, of course, took part actively in this work. His thoughts were concerned with the effort to understand Jewish life clearly. The wish arose in him to lend a hand to the new systematization of the Jewish faith. The frenzied turmoil of events stirred Rav’s soul to constant anxiety about the Jewish position. His whole life circled in a long chain between desperation and hope. His only desire was to see his people secure in its national existence.
One may see this aim in every act of his life, even while he was still a student in the synagogue and his abilities were just beginning to reveal their splendor—especially in his questions to the teachers under whom he studied. One may see the same thing in his later life when he began to think independently and all the older scholars under whom he had studied were dead.
He came to Palestine with his uncle R. Chiya and several other scholars from Babylonia. It was said then that the purpose of their coming was to aid in the people’s development. In this common aim each one had his own method: one wished to restore the spiritual soundness of the masses, another was concerned about the political situation, still another was busy protecting Jews from pagans and another one tried to set an example by his own good deeds.
The arrival of those scholars in Palestine was a great blessing for the people, especially the coming of R. Chiya. Palestine profited doubly by his presence, economically and culturally, for in addition to his activity as a teacher he was also active in commerce. He bought land and had it cultivated at his own expense or rented it out to tenants. Then he exported many divers goods from Palestine and sold them in foreign lands. He employed many people, both relatives and strangers. He had connections in the most distant countries, and a lively trade developed between Palestine and the neighboring countries. This made a living for those who helped him and also stimulated others to follow in his foot-steps.
R. Chiya’s chief item of trade was flax. It is related that once he did not wish to sell his flax for the prevailing price because he hoped for a better price later. The merchants offered his flax at the price of next Purim when flax was usually at its dearest. R. Chiya asked R. Jehudah Hanasi whether such a transaction was permissible. R. Jehudah Hanasi said that such a profit could be called “usury” and was therefore illegal. Later, therefore, R. Chiya declared that such a transaction was a transgression against the Jewish law.<sup class="footnote-marker">35)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי בבא מציעא פרק ח׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i>
When R. Chiya and his friends came to Palestine they did not settle in Sephoris, where R. Jehudah Hanasi had the seat of his power but they went to live in Tiberias. It is supposed therefore that R. Chiya’s arrival in Palestine and his activity there was not entirely pleasing to the Nasi. He did not wish another spiritual power to grow up in Palestine beside his school in Sephoris, headed by a person who reckoned his descent from king David.
Other historians, however, see no significance in the fact that R. Chiya settled in Tiberias instead of Sephoris near the “Nasi.” They say there were no ulterior motives for this act, but that the Babylonians who were accustomed to a warmer climate could not stand the atmosphere of Sephoris. They believed that most people die of colds in Sephoris.
People in Palestine used to say, also, that since the arrival of R. Chiya with his sons and students, the hurricanes and earthquakes ceased, the wine had stopped turning sour, and the flax had not spoiled.<sup class="footnote-marker">36)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין פּ״ו א׳.</span></i>
While Rav was in Tiberias with his uncle he spent a great deal of time with the students of R. Meir, R. Shimeon ben Eleazar, R. Shimeon ben Chalafta, and Symachos, from whom he acquired several of R. Meir’s sayings, which he repeated in R. Meir’s name as though he had heard them directly from R. Meir.
Thus Rav always used to say: “A man must accustom himself to think that whatever the Almighty does is done for the best,”<sup class="footnote-marker">37)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ס׳ ב׳.</span></i> or that “One should always try to teach students as briefly as possible.”<sup class="footnote-marker">38)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים ג׳ ב׳.</span></i> On other occasions he would say that “one should always leave the house when the streets are light.”<sup class="footnote-marker">39)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים ב׳ א׳.</span></i>
The sayings which Rav learned from R. Meir’s students and which he quoted in the name of R. Meir were usually such as dealt with human conduct and the aims of life. Rav loved life and did not regard it as a passing phase of universal existence.
After R. Chiya had settled in Tiberias he often took Rav with him to visit R. Jehudah Hanasi in Sephoris. The trip from Tiberias to Sephoris and back took a certain amount of time, besides which they would stop frequently during the trip because someone wished to be enlightened on some subject about which the Nasi could not be consulted at that particular time. In this way a sort of travelling religious center was established, which often changed the scene of activity. When R. Jehudah Hanasi died R. Chiya considered himself a more competent religious authority than the later “Nasi” Rabban Gamliel (the son of R. Jehudah Hanasi) or his brother R. Shimeon. He was hurt therefore that he was not chosen for some position of national leadership.
The arrival of R. Chiya and his family and students in Palestine was an event of great importance, because besides the effect of their teaching they brought new life to the crushed spirits of the Palestinians, who had almost given up all hope of a free life. Since the Babylonians were in a better position at that time than the Palestinians, R. Chiya’s group did not have bent backs, and their free manners influenced the Jews of Palestine.
The Palestinians saw a revival of the Torah in the coming of R. Chiya. At the same time the social life of the scholarly groups was revived, they began to visit each other and meet in conference.
During his trips with R. Chiya, Rav satisfied his interest in king David, and in tracing all the places where he hid from Saul and where he waged war on the Philistines, Rav acquired a precise knowledge of Palestinian geography as well as of the differences in the situation of the Jews and their customs in different places.<sup class="footnote-marker">40)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירזשלמי כתובות פרק ט׳ הלכה ט׳.</span></i>
While Rav was travelling abroad with his uncle, his sharp eye studied the life and culture of different nations. He gained an understanding of the Jewish situation in various countries,<sup class="footnote-marker">41)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ע״א ב׳.</span></i> and learned the customs of idolatry in different places in Palestine, Babylon and Media.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה י״א ב׳, ירושלמי עבודה זרה פרק א׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>)
It is probable that Rav stayed in Palestine no more than five or six years the first time that he came there with his uncle, R. Chiya, and his students. Then he returned to Babylonia for a short time. It seems that this voyage to Babylonia had no influence upon the later course of his life or upon the history of the Jews.
The reason for his return to Babylonia, it seems, was his desire to be married. Although it is not expressly stated, one can infer it from his leave-taking from R. Chiya. R. Chiya said to him in farewell, when he left his uncle to return to Babylonia, “May the Almighty protect you from a fate worse than death!” Later Rav wondered what could be worse than death, until he remembered the verse in Ecclesiastes (VII, 26) which states that “Woman is more bitter than death.” One may infer therefore that his uncle wished to warn him to be very careful in picking his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">43)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ס״ג א׳.</span></i>
When Rav was about to leave Palestine, R. Chiya said to R. Jehudah Hanasi: “My sister’s son is going to Babylonia, may he teach there?” The Nasi answered, “He may.” Then R. Chiya asked, “May he give judgment?” The Nasi answered, “He may.” Then R. Chiya asked whether he might give judgment concerning the first-born of clean cattle and the answer was, “That he may not do.”<sup class="footnote-marker">44)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ה׳ א׳.</span></i><sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">The question concerning the first-born of pure cattle was this: After the Temple was destroyed Jews could not slaughter the first-born of pure cattle unless it had suffered some injury. The extent of such an injury necessary to enable it to be slaughtered had to be certified by a court. R. Jehudah Hanasi permitted Rav to give judgment on all sorts of matters except in this case.</i>
For almost the whole period that Rav remained in Babylonia the first time he returned, he stayed in the city of Nehardea where he continued his studies. He used to correspond with R. Jehudah Hanasi and introduced certain religious problems in his letters.<sup class="footnote-marker">45)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי גטין פרק ה׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>
A short time later, when Rav had returned from Babylonia, R. Jehudah Hanasi died. This occurred around 190 C.E. Not long afterwards R. Chiya, Rav’s uncle, also died. After R. Jehudah Hanasi’s death his son Rabban Gamliel took his place and occupied the position of Nasi about ten years. Rav continued to sit in the Nasi’s school as a student. He later quoted a great deal of what he had learned from Rabban Gamliel. Only after Rabban Gamliel died and R. Jehudah N’siah the First was chosen to take his father’s place, did Rav feel that he no longer wished to remain in Palestine and he returned to Babylonia, where he remained until the end of his life.
The deteriorating political situation of the Jews in Palestine had a great influence upon Rav’s final decision to return to Babylonia permanently. Because of the political situation, R. Chiya once said that the Almighty knew the Jews would not be able to stand the persecutions of Edom, that is of the Romans, and therefore he dispersed them into Babylonia where they could live in better political circumstances.<sup class="footnote-marker">46)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים פּ״ז ב׳.</span></i>
We may infer from this statement that if R. Chiya had not felt too old and weak to go to Babylonia, he might also have left Palestine. Still the difficult political situation was not the only reason why Rav returned to Babylonia. We may assume that a great part in his decision was due to the fact that R. Jehudah N’siah did not grant him any particular position in his school; for patiently as Rav may have suffered his low position up to now, he surely did not wish to stand it any longer and therefore went away from Palestine.
It should be mentioned also that when Rav returned from Babylonia, R. Jehudah again allowed him to grant releases from vows and give judgment in cases of feminine cleanliness. When R. Jehudah Hanasi died, Rav asked his successor, Rabban Gamliel, to allow him to grant permission about the use of first-born cattle. Rabban Gamliel answered, “I cannot give you more than my father gave you.<sup class="footnote-marker">47)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה ה׳ א׳.</span></i>
Even though Rav was “ordained” only in a lesser degree, he was often invited to sit with the “Sanhedrin”, and since he was then the youngest of them all, he was always asked his opinion first when the opinions of the judges of the “Sanhedrin” were asked for.<sup class="footnote-marker">48)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין נ״ט א׳.</span></i>
R. Jochanan used to tell a story about Rav’s importance at that time. He said that when he sat in R. Jehudah Hanasi’s school, he sat seventeen rows behind Rav. During the discussion sparks used to fly from Rav’s mouth to R. Jehudah Hanasi’s mouth and from R. Jehudah Hanasi’s mouth to Rav’s mouth, and R. Jochanan would listen carefully to them and not understand a word.<sup class="footnote-marker">49)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין קל״ז ב׳.</span></i>
It appears also that others of R. Jehudah Hanasi’s students were awed by the greatness of Rav. The story goes that R. Chanina bar Chama once had a dream in which Rav was placed on a palm tree. That was counted as a sign of future greatness. R. Chanina began to fear that he would be outgrown. He wished therefore to send him away from Palestine back to Babylonia.<sup class="footnote-marker">50)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא פּ״ז ב׳.</span></i>
After the death of Rabban Gamliel, R. Jehudah Hanasi’s son, the first period in Rav’s life in which he was a pupil, ended and he wished to play the role of a teacher. Not having the same respect for R. Jehudah N’sia as he had had for his grandfather, R. Jehudah Hanasi, and his father, Rabban Gamliel he no longer wished to stay with him as a pupil.
The time when Rav returned to Babylonia was a period in which the mutual influence of the scholars was at its greatest height. And at the same time there was great friction and sharp differences of opinion between them. Even then there were several different spiritual centers and academies. Besides the academy of the Nasi in Sephoris, there were academies in Tiberias and Caesarea. R. Jehudah Hanasi attempted to concentrate all religious authority in his own hands, and since there were many scholars who rivalled the Nasi in learning, he was very sparing in granting “ordinations” and such scholars as Levi ben Sisi, Samuel of Nehardea, as well as Hezekiah and Judah the two sons of R. Chiya were not “ordained” and never entitled to be called “Rabbi”.
In the meantime things went from bad to worse politically. After the death of the Emperor Commodus (192 C. E.) Pescenius Niger tried to seize power in Rome. He was defeated in open warfare by Septimus Severus. It is hard to know today with whom the Jews sided in the warfare just as it is not known whether either of the rivals promised certain national concessions in the event of his victory.
Judging by the circumstances and the documents of that war which have remained, we may say that the Jews did not even dream of national liberation. They felt in an instinctive manner, however, that they ought to take the opposite side in this war from the side taken by the heathen inhabitants of Palestine (Romans, Greeks, and Syrians), who supported Pescenius Niger. The Samaritans of Shechem did the same—and there is only a hint in a saying of Rav as to the side which the Jews took, when he said: “I am for Sufianus.”<sup class="footnote-marker">51)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ט׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
At the same time severe fighting broke out between the Jews and the Samaritans in which a great deal of blood was shed. When Septimus Severus won and became the Emperor of Rome, the followers of Pescenius Niger were severely punished. In the year 200 when Septimus Severus returned from the field after having laid waste the Parthian lands, he passed through Palestine and issued repressive laws against the Gentiles and Samaritans.
Concerning the Jews he said merely that “if they persist in their stupid faith, they may preserve their stupidity without interference. But if a Gentile living shall allow himself to be converted to Christianity or Judaism, such an act shall be punished by death.”
Still Palestine continued to be the scene of wars and slaughters. A certain Claudius of whom nothing is known except that the Romans called him “ladro”, which means “bandit”, became the leader of guerrillas who operated in Syria and Palestine. From their lairs in the hills of Judah they would swoop down upon passers-by or upon neighboring cities and rob and murder at will.
And since many Jews were found among these guerrillas for some reason or other, the Roman government demanded that R. Eleazar ben R. Shimeon ben Yochai and R. Ishmael the son of R. Jose ben Chalafta help them discover the Jewish bandits in their caves and turn them over to the government.
At this R. Joshua ben Karcha sent the following message to R. Eleazar ben R. Shimeon: “You vinegar, son of wine, how long will you hand over the people of our God to be murdered?” R. Eleazar answered: “I am merely uprooting the thorns in the vineyard.” To which R. Joshua replied, “Let the owner of the garden come and destroy the thorns himself.”<sup class="footnote-marker">52)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פּ״ב ב׳.</span></i>
As we said Rav supported Septimus Severus. But before he left Palestine he said, “It is better to be a subject of Ishmael than of Edom.”<sup class="footnote-marker">53)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת י״א א׳.</span></i><sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">The text of this remark, which is quoted by Raba bar Machasia in the name of Rab Chama bar Gurya, who heard it from Rav, is certainly incorrect. It says, “It is better to be subject to Ishmael than to Edom, to Edom than to a “Chabar”, to a “Chabar” than to a scholar, to a scholar than to a widow and an orphan.” The part which says “to Edom than to a Chabar” is of a later period than Rav’s referring to a time when the Babylonian fire-worshippers, the “Chabarim”, persecuted the Jews, and the Jews preferred the sufferings inflicted by the Romans to those of the Persians. But the following passages are simply meaningless in the context. Since the whole quotation comes to us at third hand, and the hand of the censor also did its share of damage, we may state with assurance that the end is an apocryphal addition, and God knows who its author is.</i>
About the year 219 C. E., when Rav (Abba Arecha) was sixty-four years of age, he returned to Babylonia from Palestine for the second time and remained there for the rest of his life.
It is possible that he considered returning to Palestine at some time because it is said that he once told his son Chiya to build him a house in Palestine. It was in this connection that he discussed the boundaries of the land which may properly be called “Eretz Israel”. We may infer that Rav dreamed of leaving Babylonia and never succeeded in accomplishing his desire; and Chiya never carried out his father’s wish.<sup class="footnote-marker">54)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה ט״ז פּיסקא ה׳.</span></i>
Before Rav arrived in Babylonia, according to legend, Samuel and Kama, who were judges in Nehardea, were once standing beside the “King’s River”, that is the canal which king Hammurabi (Amraphel, king of Shinear) had constructed for a connection between the Tigris and the Euphrates. The water of the “King’s River” was dark and stormy. The two scholars knew by this sign that a man was coming to Babylonia who would stir up the whole Jewry.
No sooner had Rav arrived than there was falling-out between him and the other two scholars which ended in Rav’s curse which we have already mentioned. Later Rav always tried to be friendly to Samuel of Nehardea and treated him with great respect, even though Samuel always seemed to try to say directly the opposite of Rav. The story goes that they were both guests at a circumcision once and Rav did not wish to precede Samuel into the house, and Samuel wished to yield to still another scholar who accompanied them. Rav then took Samuel upon his shoulders and went into the house with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">55)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא פּ׳ ב׳.</span></i>
As we have already stated the academy at Nehardea was called “Sidra” at that time, and its head was Rav Shila. When Rav came to Babylonia, Aba bar Aba, the father of Samuel of Nehardea, was still living. And since Rav was unsuited to be the “Reciter” (<span dir="rtl">פּוסק סידרא</span>) or the “Interpreter” (<span dir="rtl">מתורגמן</span>) he tried to make a living in another field. The Exilarch appointed him as supervisor of the municipal market to check the weights and measures, to appraise the value of goods, determine their price, to protect buyers from being deceived. It was his duty also to see that the wine brought to market should not be adulterated.
But Rav did not fit this position either. He felt that it was his duty only to regulate weights and measures, not the price or the quality of the goods, and he felt that if a buyer let himself be deceived concerning the price or the quality of his wares, nobody had a right to interfere, for these were matters which concerned only the individual buyer and not the general welfare. For these views the Exilarch removed him from his post and since he had not obeyed the orders of the Exilarch precisely, he was arrested.<sup class="footnote-marker">56)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי בבא בתרא פרק ח׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>
After Rav Shila’s death Rav left the academy in Nehardea to Samuel and went to Hutzel where R. Achi bar Jashiah had been “head of the academy.” Since R. Achi’s pupils lacked a leader at that time, Rav was appointed as head of their academy. Hutzel was the first landmark of Rav’s independent activity in Babylonia. From then on his words were heard and his name began to be known among the scholars. And when Rav founded his academy in Sura later, the students of Hutzel were the first who came in droves to Sura.
It is hard to tell why Rav chose the valley of Sura and the city Matha Machasia for the site of his work. The academy in Sura had a loftier title than the one at Nehardea, being called not “Sidra” but “Mesivta”, even though the area of Sura was sparsely inhabited and served as a home for a pack of suspicious characters, most of whom were robbers and thieves. Rav’s academy brought culture and the security of life to the place. With the arrival of so many scholars, sources of livelihood opened for the inhabitants, who became civilized under the influence of the academy.
The place had a very hot climate as was natural for a valley of that sort. Palestinians used to say, “The Babylonians are fools who live in a dark country;”<sup class="footnote-marker">57)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים ל״ד ב׳, יומא נ״ז א׳.</span></i> but the hot climate of the place was not stable and the rainy season was not regular. Therefore people said: “Just as the Babylonians are liars so are their rains.”<sup class="footnote-marker">58)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית ט׳ ב׳.</span></i> Yet the whole area was rich in water. Besides the stormy Tigris and the quiet Euphrates, the whole countryside was covered with a network of lakes and ponds whose shores were covered with reeds from which they wove mats and many workers were employed at cutting these reeds.
Various strange creatures were found among those reeds: worms and mosquitoes which spread all sorts of contagious diseases throughout the region. Many epidemics broke out near Sura, but it is related that none of them prevailed in Rav’s vicinity.<sup class="footnote-marker">59)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית כ״א ב׳.</span></i> The reason probably is that the Jews knew methods of warding off the disease. They usually planted groves of date-palms which cleansed the atmosphere with their scent. Once the forests were planted they had other uses also. Various vessels were made of their wood. A beer was made of the dates, and the twigs and branches were used for weaving baskets.
Beer drinking was very prevalent in Babylonia. It was usually made of dates. Other beers were brewed from hops in which the country carried on a widespread commerce.<sup class="footnote-marker">60)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא צ״ב ב׳.</span></i> A malt beer is also mentioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">61)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים ק״ז א׳.</span></i> Many of the Babylonian scholars made beer and grew rich. In general beer was considered a sort of wine substitute, and a problem arose whether <span dir="rtl">״קידוש״</span> (the sanctification of the Sabbath) might be pronounced with beer. Rav said that “Kiddush” might not be pronounced with beer, but <span dir="rtl">״הבדלה״</span> (the separation of the Sabbath) might.<sup class="footnote-marker">62)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים ק״ז ב׳.</span></i>
Babylon had very little olive oil, and when R. Tarphon said that Friday night candles could be made only out of olive oil, R. Jochanan ben Nuri rose and asked: “What are the Babylonians to do, who have only sesame oil?”<sup class="footnote-marker">63)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת כ״ו א׳.</span></i>
The various oils which the scholars allowed to be used for Sabbath candles were all to be found in Babylonia. There were various sorts of aromatic plants also as we may infer from the blessing which Rav composed for good scents.<sup class="footnote-marker">64)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות מ״ג א׳, ירושלמי ברכות פרק ו׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i>
There was also a great deal of wheat in the vicinity of Sura. Other parts of Babylonia would import wheat from there when they lacked it. The country also had a great deal of fruit and, as we have said, enough water to enable them to transport fruit easily from one place to another. Thus the Talmud says: “Who brought it about that the storehouses of Babylon are full of grain?” and answers: “The country has vast water resources.” And Rav added, “Babylonia is rich and fruitful even without rain.”<sup class="footnote-marker">65)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית י׳ א׳.</span></i>
Rav and his students as well used to work in the fields and plant gardens with their own hands. For this work they would borrow money in the month of Tishri and pay their debts in grain in the month of Tebet at the price of Tishri.<sup class="footnote-marker">66)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא ע״ב ב׳.</span></i>
It may be assumed that Rav tried to make his students self-supporting so that they would not have to depend on the charity of kind-hearted people, who made gifts to scholars in order to share in the reward of their learning. Therefore Rav set aside only two months of the year for study — the months of Adar and Elul — and made the people work for their living the rest of the year. He probably chose those two months because in Babylonia one could not work or study during the summer because of the great heat: only in Elul, when the air had begun to cool off a bit could one begin to think of studying. The second month, Adar, always came after harvest which took place during the months of Tebeth and Shvat. There was an additional advantage in studying during those two months in that they could review the laws of the approaching holidays.
Babylonia was a country of broad pastures and there was range for the breeding of large numbers of cattle. Rav’s students did a great deal of cattle herding and Rav himself was greatly interested, in his research, in lightening the religious prescriptions about the observance of Sabbath which made it difficult to allow the men to graze cattle during the Sabbath. Thus he spoke about the problem of saving an animal which had fallen into a pond on the Sabbath<sup class="footnote-marker">67)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קכ״ה ב׳.</span></i> and about tying an animal to a stake on the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">68)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ג א׳.</span></i>
As we have said, Rav could not or did not wish to remain in Nehardea and he chose Sura for the center of his future work. Since then Sura was called “Rav’s place” and just as Babylonia itself was divided geographically into the upper hilly region and a lower region of valleys, the leadership of the Jews was divided between Sura and Nehardea.
The center in Sura quickly became the more important and most of the communities in the country accepted Rav’s theories and regulated their lives according to them. The Nehardean scholars often tried to put their ideas over but without success.
Rav did not remain content with merely the work in his academy. He travelled from city to city throughout Babylonia trying to establish his policies. His students after him did the same, settling in over twenty cities, and in spite of opposition they succeeded in propagating Rav’s religious views. By the revolutionary struggle and the wanderings of these people over the broad prairies and sandy wastes of Babylonia the region of Sura became thickly populated with Jews. Over night Jewish settlements sprang up there.
Together with the Jews a cosmopolitan mass of different peoples also came, and drove the earlier inhabitants, the “Parthians” out and settled in their place. In many parts of Babylonia Jewish tribes declared themselves politically independent and set up rulers out of their midst. Elsewhere the Heathen persecuted the Jews and the Jews bent their backs under the yoke of oppression. Frequently the Jews sowed the fields and cultivated them, only to see other peoples come and take over the fields with the aid of a new government. A new law based on the right of power developed and whoever seized a field was its lawful owner until someone stronger came and seized it for himself.
When Rav came to Babylonia, king Artaban, a friend of his, ruled there. After the death of this king, Babylonia was captured by a foreign tribe named the “Sassanides” who set up their own king, Ardjir Babegan, upon the throne. Under his rule the condition of the Jews quickly deteriorated. Power was in the hands of the old Aramites, who regarded themselves as descended from the ancient Babylonians who destroyed the first Temple and drove the Jews out of Palestine.
There was a strong hatred between the Jews and the Aramites, and most of the “Anti-Gentile” passages in the Talmud were directed against them.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">It should be noted that most of the censors who supervised the printing of the Talmud did a great deal of destruction in erasing the word “Arami” (Aramite), and substituting <span dir="rtl">עכו״ם</span> (idolator) as one may see in the texts printed by R. N. Rabinowitz in his book “Dikdukei Sofrim” for which he used a Talmud manuscript of the year 1502.</i> Jews ordinarily regarded them as murderers and highway-robbers. Jews did not even trust their doctors, as Rav said: “Whoever wishes to become blind, may have his eyes treated by an Aramite doctor.”<sup class="footnote-marker">69)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדה ל״ה ב׳, ירושלמי עבודה זרה פרק ב׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>
At the same time there was a tendency among those peoples to be converted to Judaism, in order to enjoy the rights of a <span dir="rtl">״גר״</span> (proselyte) among Jews. Rav, as well as the other scholars of that time, protested sharply against the acceptance of proselytes for fear of mixture of races.
In addition to his fear of racial mixture Rav was also afraid of the confusion of cultures. He continually issued warnings against those who followed the ways of the “Magics” (<span dir="rtl">אמגושיים</span>) who occupied themselves with star-gazing and grave-robbing for magical purposes. They believed, also, that the dead continue to live in another world, get married and eat just as though they were alive. In addition to the Magics, Rav cautioned the people against imitating the <span dir="rtl">״חברים״</span> that is the Persians who later overran the whole of Babylonia.
Because of the change in the political situation in Babylonia, from which the Jews suffered severely, Rav was often afflicted with a feeling of desperation. He used to say: “A time will come yet when the Torah will be completely forgotten by the Jews.”<sup class="footnote-marker">70)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קל״ח ב׳.</span></i>
At first the customs of the “Magics” and the “Chaborim” struck the Jews as being very queer. A proverb concerning the Magics said that “They jabber they know not what.”<sup class="footnote-marker">71)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה כ״ב א׳.</span></i> Nevertheless Rav was afraid that the Jews might learn their ways and he waged a lively war against this. He said that when the Almighty promised a son to the Patriarch Abraham, Abraham took his horoscope and saw that he could not have any children, and the Almighty told him: “Do not stargaze, for a Jew should not believe in destiny.”<sup class="footnote-marker">72)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קנ״ו א׳, נדרים ל״ב א׳.</span></i>
On another occasion Rav said: “In the next world there is no eating and drinking, no trade or commerce, no jealousy, hatred or intrigue; the good sit with crowns on their heads and partake of the glow of the Holy Spirit.”<sup class="footnote-marker">73)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות י״ז א׳.</span></i>
When Rav saw that the people refused to heed his words, and insisted on believing in a new sort of life after death, with food and drink, as the “Magics” persuaded them to believe, he said; “My son, be happy in what you have now, for there is no pleasure in the pit, and when death comes, one cannot tell him to wait. Men are like the grass of the field, some sprout and others wilt.”<sup class="footnote-marker">74)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין נ״ד א׳.</span></i>
It should be remarked also that when Rav arrived in Babylonia, the moral condition of the people in Nehardea and its vicinity was very low. Living mainly in the cities where luxury was rife, the people were much given to sin. A legend relates that one of the “Amoraim” once met the Prophet Elijah and asked why he delayed his coming. The Prophet Elijah answered him: “How can Messiah come when there is so much sin among you even on Yom Kippur?”<sup class="footnote-marker">75)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא י״ט ב׳.</span></i>
In many places in the vicinity of Nehardea, men’s clothing was made after women’s styles because of their loose morals, so that mingling of the sexes should be unnoticeable. Promiscuity was so widespread and so uncontrollable that a rule was actually adopted that a witness could not be disqualified because of moral turpitude.<sup class="footnote-marker">76)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין כ״ו ב׳.</span></i>
Before Rav’s arrival in Sura the people there were rather wild, and are described as having been bold, immodest, and obscene in their speech. It was only because they were mostly shepherds and farmers that they were not as dissolute as the Nehardeans. Rav expended much effort in teaching morals, especially regarding sexual relations. When speaking on this subject Rav always clothed his remarks in real-life allegories; he threatened the sinners with God’s severest punishment saying that it was precisely because of crimes of this sort that Jerusalem was destroyed.
Religion as well as morality stood at a low level in Sura. Rav instituted a number of regulations designed to strengthen religious feeling. He was very strict in demanding that the commandments be obeyed and religious duties performed. His strict regulations are known as “Rav’s prohibitions”.<sup class="footnote-marker">77)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי שקלים פרק ז׳ הלכה ב׳, עבודה זרה פרק ב׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>
He would curse anybody who permitted any act which ought to be prohibited.<sup class="footnote-marker">78)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה ה׳ ב׳.</span></i> He was convinced that if a person was suspected of a crime he was probably guilty, even if not entirely then in part, and if he had not even partially committed the crime, then he had contemplated doing so.<sup class="footnote-marker">79)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן י״ח ב׳.</span></i>
After Rav came to Sura the city was rebuilt in a beautiful style. Rav made a regulation that the synagogue should be the highest structure in the city. R. Chama bar Guria says of this, quoting Rav, that “a city which builds the roofs of its houses higher than the roof of its synagogue, is doomed to destruction.”<sup class="footnote-marker">80)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת י״א א׳.</span></i> It is known that Rav loved beauty in general, and it is said he always wore handsome silk robes.<sup class="footnote-marker">81)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ד׳ א׳.</span></i> His clothes were embroidered with jewelry<sup class="footnote-marker">82)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ד׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> and his seal signature had the form of a fish.<sup class="footnote-marker">83)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא קס״א ב׳.</span></i>
His school had a garden planted around it, just as his city and even the cemeteries were encircled by gardens. He built an anteroom all around his school which was walled up to a balcony. He had over two thousand students, all of whom ate at his table,<sup class="footnote-marker">84)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ק״ו א׳.</span></i> and he built the wall because he didn’t want chance passers-by to look at them and put a curse upon them. In addition he had the place where his students ate supplied with mats for them to sleep upon.<sup class="footnote-marker">85)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות כ״ה א׳.</span></i>
It seems probable also that Rav’s school was situated in a high place for the expression “they went up to Rav’s house” is often used.<sup class="footnote-marker">86)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ו׳ הלכה ו׳, מועד קטן פרק ג׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i> He also ordered the synagogue to be built in the center of the town, so that all the houses should be near the synagogue.<sup class="footnote-marker">87)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא ק״ז ב׳.</span></i>
By studying Rav’s teachings one soon learns that he had an individual system. A great difficulty in reconstructing this system is the fact that most of Rav’s utterances are not handed down directly from himself but only in the form in which his students have quoted them. The only conclusion which can safely be drawn from all the material we possess concerning Rav, is the conclusion that when Rav issued judgment upon any legal problem, he tried first of all to understand the spirit of the legal rule which could be applied to that problem. This method is particularly clear in cases where he tried to discover the author of a certain anonymous “Mishnah”. He would ask “From what Tanna does this Mishnah derive?” and in his further analysis of the problem, Rav showed himself to be the greatest of all the previous scholars.
He knew that there were certain definite rules in the system of the Mishnah which defined the stand which any Tanna would take on a given problem. Knowing the rule defining a Tanna’s bias from the Mishnah’s in which his name was mentioned, Rav could easily discover the author of any anonymous “Mishnah” which bore the unmistakable stamp of the same tendency. In the discussion of the law concerning the “vermin and reptiles” which were forbidden food for a Jew, it is stated that if a Jew caught or wounded one on the Sabbath, providing this catching or wounding was not necessary for his own use, he was innocent of a sin. Rav then asked: “On the basis of whose legal opinions has this law been constructed? — for this was an anonymous Misnah. And he answered that the Mishnah agreed with the opinion of R. Shimeon (ben Yochai) who stated, “Some work which is not necessarily for one’s personal needs, is not considered a sin when it is done on the Sabbath.”<sup class="footnote-marker">88)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ק״ז ב׳.</span></i>
This method of seeking out the author of all anonymous Mishnahs remained the system of the academy in Sura until it went out of existence. In Nehardea, on the other hand, there was never any interest in the authorship of any Mishnah. For them it was the law itself which was important without regard to its origin and authorship.
Rav also had a fine style both in Hebrew and in Aramaic. Everything he said seemed to be carved out of a single piece. Even today it is an aesthetic delight to study any of Rav’s utterances, whether the contents are of interest or not.
Concerning the scope of the term “sacrilege” Rav declared that a man like himself would be guilty of that transgression “if he bought some meat from a butcher and did not pay immediately,” because the butcher might think that Rav had simply robbed him of the meat, and that might lead him to think lightly of the crime of robbery himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">89)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא פּ״ג א׳.</span></i>
In speaking of the precise meaning of the term “idler” Rav said that “an idler means a man like R. Samuel bar Shilet<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">It is somewhat strange, to be sure, that Rav should have chosen a person like R. Samuel bar Shilet to illustrate the meaning of the word “idler,” because it is believed that this R. Samuel bar Shilet was neither a rich man nor an idler, but a teacher of children who lived on what his pupils paid him. Rav probably meant that a man like R. Samuel bar Shilet had all his needs provided for him in his house and did not need to work in the fields to get his food, as the other scholars in Babylonia had to do, and therefore he could sleep quietly in his bed as though it were a palace and the tax collector knew him not.</i> who eats of his own and drinks of his own and sleeps like a prince in a palace and the tax collector never comes to his door.”<sup class="footnote-marker">90)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ס״ב א׳.</span></i>
When asked to what extent a man is obliged to preach to his fellow men, Rav answered, “Until the hearer begins to beat the preacher.” When they mentioned the rule that a person who travels a good deal ought to put up always at the same house and the question was raised, “How long should he continue to do so?” Rav answered, “Until they beat him there.”<sup class="footnote-marker">91)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערכין ט״ז ב׳.</span></i>
In Rav’s opinion a man ought to perform his religious duties consistently and not be deterred by any hindrances which might bar his way. He was consequently very severe and would have anybody flogged who disobeyed him. He paid special attention to the morals and protection of women. It is said that he flogged anyone who married a woman simply through intercourse, or when a man met a woman in the street and married her without a prior agreement about the wedding contract. He did the same when a man revoked his divorce or declared that the divorce which he had given to his wife was invald. He also had a man flogged who lived with his wife in his father-in-law’s house.<sup class="footnote-marker">92)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות נ״ב א׳, קדושין י״ב ב׳.</span></i>
Although Rav tried to make his words and his meaning clear, he ordinarily spoke so briefly that his students understood very little of what he said. Yet they were afraid to ask him to go back. The only ones who summoned up enough courage to ask him to explain his statements were Rav Cahana and Rav Asi. When he explained his meaning to them, they asked why he hadn’t used those words previously. He said it was because he had not supposed that they needed an explanation.”<sup class="footnote-marker">93)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה כ״ז א׳, נזיר י״ט א׳, סוטה י״ב ב׳, סנהדרין י׳ ב׳.</span></i>
In citing the text of the Mishnah Rav would hardly ever say what, in his opinion, the Mishnah meant, or why he supported one interpretation rather than another. He would do this only when his students asked him. He never explained anything of his own accord because he assumed that the matter was as clear to his audience as it was to himself. Occasionally in study it was discovered that a certain law would have been reversed if the action to which it had referred had taken place in a different region. Rav left such apparent contradictions unexplained, and even when questioned about them he was silent.<sup class="footnote-marker">94)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ביצה ו׳ א׳.</span></i>
It seems that the habit of reading things into the Mishnah which were not there often displeased him. He said therefore that the words “all the days of the poor are evil” refer to those who deal with the “Gemara” while “the good of heart live a continual feast” refers to those who get their knowledge from the Mishnah.<sup class="footnote-marker">95)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא קמ״ה ב׳.</span></i>
In Sura every word Rav spoke was heard in pious awe and hardly ever questioned. It was different in Nehardea. His sayings often seemed queer to the scholars there. Because of this he said, “I sometimes have to declare the reason for what I say so that the future generations may not criticize me.”<sup class="footnote-marker">96)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ע״ה ב׳.</span></i>
As we remarked, Rav encouraged his students to teach others and sit in judgment without interference. This, too, he did in opposition to other scholars who tried to limit the rights of their students and insisted that during their lifetime no student of theirs was to pass any judgment without consulting them first. Rav would say to his students: “You may advise on any legal matter that comes to your attention, because a judge can know only that which his eyes see.”<sup class="footnote-marker">97)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי נדה פרק ב׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i>
Before he opened class he always said the prayer of “Sh’ma” and when he would refer to God, he experienced his greatest exaltation of spirit. He said that a blessing without mention of God was no blessing.<sup class="footnote-marker">98)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות מ׳ ב׳,</span></i> He said also that God’s name contained the ten attributes of God, with which, as it were, He created the Universe: wisdom, understanding, knowledge, power, fury, strength, justice, law, grace, and mercy.<sup class="footnote-marker">99)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה י״ב א׳.</span></i> He felt that an oath taken in court was useless without mention of God’s name, for he felt that the mention of God’s name in an oath frightened a witness.<sup class="footnote-marker">100)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">100) שבועות ל״ח ב׳.</span></i>
It is said that when he stood praying, his whole body would quiver and his soul would fill with a peculiar joy. He always said at such a time “where there is rejoicing there must be trembling.”<sup class="footnote-marker">101)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">101) ברכות כ׳ ב׳, יומא ד׳ ב׳.</span></i> Before he rose to pray, he would always try to cleanse his thoughts and he set up a rule that “if one knows that his thoughts are troubled, he should not pray.”<sup class="footnote-marker">102)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">102) ערובין ס״ח ב׳.</span></i> Once he proclaimed a fast for rain and it did him no good. When another person rose to pray in the synagogue and his prayer was granted, Rav immediately tried to find out what were the good deeds of the petitioner whose prayer the Almighty had heard and granted rain.<sup class="footnote-marker">103)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">103) תענית כ״ד א׳.</span></i>
We can not be certain how much of his later life Rav lived in Babylonia. According to the “Epistle of R. Shrira Gaon” Rav headed his academy in Sura for 24 years. Other historians estimate the amount of time which Rav spent in Babylonia after his second term from Palestine at 28 years. We may assume that both opinions are correct, for it is possible that he did head the academy for not more than 24 years. There were four years between Rav’s return to Babylonia and the time he founded the academy in Sura, during which he was an “Interpreter” for Rav Shila on Nehardea and a supervisor of the municipal market.
In any case it is certain that Rav reached a ripe old age and he had the good fortune to see many of his ambitions realized during his life. His academy developed in a brilliant fashion and his opinions were accepted everywhere. Large groups of students, old and young, many of whom later became prominent scholars, always surrounded him when he walked in the street or came into the school. Everybody paid him the greatest respect. His academy was called a “minor holy place” and he himself “Our Great Rabbi.”
His opponents made peace with him and wherever he himself did not abandon his opinion, as he often did, his authority was recognized in various religious decisions. Even Samuel of Nehardea, who always defended exactly the opposite point-of-view from Rav, later began to submit to Rav’s opinion in the interpretation of many laws.<sup class="footnote-marker">104)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">104) בבא מציעא ק״ז א׳.</span></i>
It is characteristic that Samuel treated Rav’s opinions with scorn when he heard them from one of his students. At such times he would not call him by the name of Rav but Abba. Once R. Chiya bar Joseph told him some opinion of Rav’s and Samuel replied: “If Abba said that it proves he knows nothing about the laws of the Sabbath.”<sup class="footnote-marker">105)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">105) שבת נ״ג א׳.</span></i> In the same manner Samuel said to the same student about a case in impure foods: “If Abba said that it proves that he knows nothing about the laws of impure foods.”<sup class="footnote-marker">106)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">106) חולין מ״ה ב׳.</span></i>
It is related that a man once came to Rav and asked what his status was among Jews since his mother had conceived him by an “Aramite”. “You are a proper Jew,” said Rav, because he believed that “When a Heathen or a slave has sexual relations with a Jewish woman, the child of such a union is a good Jew.” No sooner had Rav declared his opinion that R. Chama bar Gurya, a pupil of Rav, said to the man: “Get away from here as fast as you can before Samuel arrives, because as soon as Samuel comes and hears what Rav has said, he will decide against you.”<sup class="footnote-marker">107)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">107) ירושלמי קדושין פרק ג׳ הלכה י״ב.</span></i>
Rav studied day and night. People said the same of him as was said of king David, that he slept no longer than sixty breaths.<sup class="footnote-marker">108)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">108) סוכה כ׳׳ז א׳.</span></i> Since he was always wanted on business, he would say; “Scholars never have any rest, neither in this world nor in the next.”<sup class="footnote-marker">109)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">109) ברכות ס״ד א׳.</span></i>
As we said, Rav had great influence with king Artaban who was his personal friend. It was through the support of this friend that Rav founded the academy in Sura. When king Artaban died, Rav said: “The bond is loose,” referring to their tie of friendship, just as R. Jehudah N’siah said when Emperor Antonius died.<sup class="footnote-marker">110)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">110) עבודה זרה י׳ ב׳, י״א א׳.</span></i> It is certain that the later rulers of the country respected the academy in Sura, and in spite of the changes which took place in politics as well as in rulers, the academy was not suppressed. It is certain too however, that the Jews were greatly afflicted outside the academy, and Rav groaned in pain at the evil lot of the people. He said, for example: “If all the seas were ink and all the reeds in the swamps were pens, they would not suffice to describe all the evil torments which a ruler can invent for his subjects.”<sup class="footnote-marker">111)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">111) שבת י״א א׳.</span></i>
As we said Rav believed in a comfortable and quiet life and he used to say of certain people that “their life was not worth living” as, for instance, of “tent-dwellers and those who wander in the desert.”<sup class="footnote-marker">112)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">112) ערובין נ״ה ב׳.</span></i> or “people who are merciful, emotional and sensitive.”<sup class="footnote-marker">113)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">113) פּסחים קי״ג ב׳.</span></i> Food and clothing were matters of the highest importance for Rav. Therefore he always prayed that “the Almighty give him a life of peace, a secure living, so that he could straighten his bones, a life of wealth and honor, of which he need not be ashamed.”<sup class="footnote-marker">114)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">114) ירושלמי פרק ט׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i>
What he said of food and clothing is also typical: “A man should sell even the balconies of his house so that he may wear shoes on his feet. If he has had himself bled and has nothing to eat to revive himself, let him sell his shoes and buy food.”<sup class="footnote-marker">115)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">115) שבת קכ״ט א׳.</span></i> We have it recorded, also, that Rav ate meat like bread, salted and dried meat.<sup class="footnote-marker">116)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">116) שבת ק״מ ב׳.</span></i> He used to fill out his repast with a few young doves stuffed with meal.<sup class="footnote-marker">117)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">117) פּסחים קי״ט ב׳.</span></i> In addition he liked to eat fish. He followed strictly the instructions given him by an old fisherman as to the best time for catching fish and when they are good to eat.<sup class="footnote-marker">118)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">118) מועד קטן י״א א׳.</span></i>
Just as important as food and fine clothing for Rav was a life without humiliation. He used to say “Shame shortens men’s lives.”
Like all other Babylonians Rav seems to have had stomach trouble. It was said that “more people die of a full pot than an empty belly.”<sup class="footnote-marker">119)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">119) שבת ל״ג א׳.</span></i> and Rav was certainly among those who suffered as we may see from his remark, “A man can stand any sickness except kidney trouble; any pain can be borne except the pain of the heart, any ache but a headache.”<sup class="footnote-marker">120)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">120) שבת י״א א׳.</span></i>
In his later years Rav’s eyes were weak. He lived at the time with his grandson, Shimi bar Chiya. He was unable to see the people who spoke to him and had to recognize them by their voices. His eyes were never cured even though they were treated with a special salve.<sup class="footnote-marker">121)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">121) חולין קי״א ב׳.</span></i> His memory was poor at the same time and people said, “He has forgotten his knowledge.” To a certain question he himself replied: “We had a citation for that and we have forgotten it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">122)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">122) זבחים נ״ט א׳.</span></i> Seeing that he sometimes forgot what he himself had said made him realize that a person might sometimes forget a commandment and could be reminded of it if something should happen to which that commandment might apply.<sup class="footnote-marker">123)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">123) פּסחים ס״ו א׳, סנהדרין פּ״ב א׳.</span></i>
Nevertheless his reason was unclouded until his last day. He used to defend his earlier views with an especial stubbornness and he would say: “Anybody who feels competent to answer me, may come and do so.”<sup class="footnote-marker">124)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">124) ירושלמי כתובות פרק ט׳ הלכה ט׳.</span></i> Once he had a debate with one of his pupils concerning a law and was defeated. He said: “Even though he has defeated me, I feel that the law should be as I say.”<sup class="footnote-marker">125)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">125) ירושלמי סנהדרין פרק ז׳ הלכה י״א.</span></i>
When his health was completely undermined, Rav became desperate. He would say that an old man who walks with a bent back and his eyes fixed on the ground “tries to find what he has not lost.”<sup class="footnote-marker">126)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">126) שבת קנ״ב א׳.</span></i> and also that “when a man’s end approaches anybody can be his ruler.”<sup class="footnote-marker">127)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">127) נדרים מ״א א׳.</span></i>
Later on Rav died. The whole of Jewry was shocked and when the news was told to Samuel of Nehardea he tore thirteen suits of clothing and said: “The man whom I feared is dead.”<sup class="footnote-marker">128)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">128) מועד קטן כ״ד א׳.</span></i> Thousands of scholars from all over Babylonia came to Rav’s funeral. All of them tore their clothes and bewailed the great misfortune which had befallen the Jews. All the Jewish communities resolved to mourn Rav’s death twelve months, and in sign of mourning they did not carry <i>palms</i> and <i>myrths</i> to their children’s weddings as they had been accustomed to do.<sup class="footnote-marker">129)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">129) שבת ק״י א׳.</span></i>
After Rav’s death his students continued to associate with each other. Each one would repeat what he had heard from Rav, and any one who could repeat something clever of Rav’s felt proud and was honored by the other students. A long time thereafter Sura remained without a leader, even though it did not cease to exist and continued to be called “Rav’s house”. Still the academy in Nehardea became authoritative in all religious decisions in the life of the Jews of Babylonia, and questions which were too difficult for Sura were referred to Samuel in Nehardea.
The acting head of Sura was Rab Hamnuna; as the Talmud says, wherever one sees it written, “Rav’s house says,” the person meant is Rab Hamnuna,<sup class="footnote-marker">130)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">130) סנהדרין י״ז א׳.</span></i> and Rab Hamnuna himself was known as “the old man of Rav’s house.”<sup class="footnote-marker">131)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">131) בבא קמא ע״ה א׳.</span></i>
Rav’s influence on later generations of the Jewish people was particularly strong because of his splendid prayers which he used to compose extemporaneously while praying in the synagogue as representative of the congregation, or before opening his class. His faith in the power of prayer was enormous. Nevertheless he seldom prayed for any personal benefit, but always for the general welfare or in behalf of other people.<sup class="footnote-marker">132)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">132) ירושלמי נדרים פרק ט׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i> He would say, “Whoever can pray for his fellow man and does not do so, must be called a sinner.”<sup class="footnote-marker">133)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">133) ברכות י״ב ב׳.</span></i> He said, also, that there are three transgressions from which a man cannot be saved and one of these is the delusion “that if one has prayed earnestly the Almighty will surely be compelled to grant his prayer.”<sup class="footnote-marker">134)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">134) בבא בתרא קס״ד ב׳.</span></i>
Rav’s prayers usually contained thanks for the grace which the Almighty shows unto his people Israel, from the days of Abraham till the time when Messiah will come; and the greatest kindness of all these was the fact that He chose the Jews so that they may stand before Him, thank His Blessed Name, and confess Him as their only God. In his prayers Rav would ask further that the Almighty might at length open the eyes of the Heathens and make them realize they worshipped idols that were of no use. Then the whole world would realize the greatness of Israel’s God, who did the Jews the great kindness to choose them from among all the nations, and who from the beginning of time had set aside for them so precious a heritage as the Torah, which was the very purpose for which the Universe was created.<sup class="footnote-marker">135)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">135) סנהדרין צ״א ב׳.</span></i>
On other occasions Rav would pray that just as He had cast His fear on all the nations when the Jews were delivered from Egypt and when He led them for forty years in the wilderness, so may he again cast His fear upon all His creatures, so that all men together might make one bond to serve the Almighty; for if the Heathens feared the Jews, they would also fear God.
Four sorts of people, said Rav, were especially obliged to thank God for his Grace: one who completed a voyage on the ocean, or across the desert, one who is released from a prison, or arises from a sick-bed.<sup class="footnote-marker">136)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">136) ברכות נ״ד ב׳.</span></i>
Rav was a great stylist and his prayers often rival the prophets in their simplicity. It is characteristic of Rav that he mentioned the end of the Jewish dispersion in most of his prayers. Thus he ordained that every day one should say: “Break off the yoke of the Heathens from our necks and lead us in pride into our own land.” He added to the Sabbath prayer these words: “Let the Almighty bring us in joy into our land and plant us in our own boundaries.” Similarly for the prayer on holidays: “Gather up our scattered remnants from among the Heathens and our dispersed ones from all lands of the earth.”
It is typical of Rav’s prayers that rather than asking for future favors, he expresses his gratitude for what the Almighty has already done. Merely the privilege of being allowed to praise God he felt, was itself a cause for thanks. He ordained, therefore, that we say, “We thank Thee our God for having led us out of Egypt, delivered us out of bondage, and Thou hast even permitted us to render thanks unto Thy great name.<sup class="footnote-marker">137)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">137) ירושלמי ברכות פרק א׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i>
If a person undertakes a fast, said Rav, he must declare in his prayers what is the purpose for which he undertook to fast. It is not sufficient that he knows the Almighty is aware of the purpose of his prayer, but he must declare it expressly.<sup class="footnote-marker">138)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">138) ירשלמי ברכות פרק ב׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i> Rav had the same thing in mind when he ordained that whenever there is an additional prayer (<span dir="rtl">מוסף</span>) the purpose of the “Musaf” must be declared in praying.<sup class="footnote-marker">139)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">139) ירושלמי ברכות פרק ד׳ הלכה ו׳, פרק ט׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>
In the controversy whether the Creation of the Universe took place in the month of Nisan, which is called the first month in the Bible, or in the month of Tishri, when the Babylonians celebrated their New Year, Rav argued for “Tishri”. It is an accepted tradition also that Rav arranged the verses of the <span dir="rtl">מלכיות, זכרונות, שופרות</span> which we recite during “Musaf” on New Year, and in the Talmud they are called <span dir="rtl">״תקיעתא דרב״</span>. <span dir="ltr"><sup class="footnote-marker">140)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">140) ראש השנה כ״ז א׳, ירושלמי ר״ה פּ״א ה״ג, עבודה זרה פּ״א ה״ב, ויקרא רבה כ״ט א׳.</span></i></span>
In the introduction to the so called <span dir="rtl">סדר מלכיות</span> he says: “Rule Thou o God, over the Universe with Thy glory, rise up in Thy splendor over the earth, and shine forth in Thy sublime strength over all those who inhabit Thy earth, so that every creature may know that Thou hast created it, and every thing that has the breath of life in its nostrils may say that the God of Israel is the only King of the Universe and His Majesty rules over all.”
As an introduction to the so called <span dir="rtl">״סדר זכרונות״</span> he ordained that the following be said: “O God, Thou rememberest all the happenings on earth and the creatures of all time. To Thee are revealed all dark and hidden things, the secrets of Creation, for in the seat of Thy Glory there is no forgetting and nothing is hidden from Thine eyes. Thou recallest everything that has happened to every creature, everything is apparent and known to Thee, for Thou lookest and seest all unto the end of all the generations. Thou hast also set aside a time of reminding for all Thy creatures, wherein various events and infinite multitudes of creatures shall be called to mind, which Thou hast long known and already revealed. This day is the beginning of Thy work; a memorial of the first day of Creation for the Jews, wherein the God of Jacob sits in judgment over man. This day the judgment of the kingdoms is set forth, which to the sword and which shall have peace, which shall have hunger and which shall have fullness. Who is not mentioned on this day? The memory of every living thing comes before Thee today, and Thou recallest every human deed, every thought of a man, every human deception. Happy is that man who forgets Thee not and holds fast to Thee, for they who pray to Thee are never deceived and they who trust in Thee are not shamed forever.”
Besides all these prayers Rav also arranged the “Haftaroth” to be recited from the Prophets after the reading of the Pentateuch every Sabbath and Holiday.<sup class="footnote-marker">141)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">141) מגלה ל״א ב׳.</span></i>
It was the general opinion of scholars concerning Rav, which nobody presumed to contradict, that “he was worthy to have had the Holy Spirit rest upon him”. This was not possible however because “he lived in Babylonia.”<sup class="footnote-marker">142)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">142) מועד קטן כ״ה א׳.</span></i>
It is related too that Rav did a great deal of travelling. He was continually touring various cities in the interest of the Torah and its propagation, both in Palestine and later on when he was in Babylonia. He therefore spoke frequently about proper behavior on a trip or when a man puts up at an inn. Wherever he travelled Rav acquainted himself with conditions and appreciated the hospitality which he encountered everywhere. He frequently warned people against the dangers of journeying and he would say, “No person should go out alone at night.”<sup class="footnote-marker">143)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">143) ברכות מ״ג ב׳.</span></i> Another time he said that “if one accompanies his friend who is setting out on a journey even so short a distance as four ells within a city, the traveller will meet with no harm.”<sup class="footnote-marker">144)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">144) סוטה מ״ו ב׳.</span></i>
In everything that Rav ever said about human conduct his intention to protect the weak against the strong is apparent, he tried in the first instance to make women independent and equal in their rights with men so that they should not be dependent on man’s caprice. At that time a man had the right to divorce his wife on the slightest pretext. The concept of “scandalous thing” (Deuteronomy, 24:1) was so interpreted that the slightest cause could serve as grounds for a divorce. It was enough for a man to see a more beautiful woman than his wife for him to divorce her.<sup class="footnote-marker">145)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">145) גטין צ׳ א׳.</span></i> But the woman could never get rid of the husband whom her father or older brother had chosen for her.
The scholars introduced many changes in these laws, to enable a woman to demand a divorce under certain conditions and gave the courts the right to force her husband to grant it to her: for instance if her husband was disabled or lost an eye or a hand, or broke his leg; or if his trade gave him an unpleasant odor. There was even one opinion which said that even if a woman knew of her husband’s disabilities or unpleasant occupation and still agreed to the match, she could declare that she did not understand at the time how much she would have to suffer and that later she perceived her error.<sup class="footnote-marker">146)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">146) כתובות ע״ז א׳.</span></i>
All these aids for the woman in getting a divorce were not enough for Rav. He was dreadfully hurt when he saw a woman who was bound to a bad husband without any chance of release because he did not have any of the faults mentioned above. He added, therefore, a number of causes for divorce, saying that “when a man takes a vow that he will no longer seek any pleasure in his wife, he must divorce her immediately and pay her the sum of her contract.” In such a case one need not wait to see whether the man cannot get a release from his vow, but he must divorce her immediately.<sup class="footnote-marker">147)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">147) כתובות ס״א ב׳.</span></i>
A man’s duty to feed his wife and provide her with everything she needed was regarded by Rav as the most important part of the marriage contract, and he declared that if a man said to his wife: “I will no longer feed you!” one should not wait until he carried out his threat, but the court must order him to give his wife a divorce and pay her the sum of her contract.<sup class="footnote-marker">148)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">148) כתובות ס״ג א׳, ע״ז א׳.</span></i>
In order to prevent such mishaps between man and wife as much as possible Rav said that “a man must not marry off his daughter when she is young and cannot tell whom she would like to marry.”<sup class="footnote-marker">149)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">149) קדושין מ״א א׳.</span></i> In addition he forbade the marriage of one’s daughter to an old man or the marriage of a son who had not reached authority.<sup class="footnote-marker">150)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">150) סנהדרין ע״ז ב׳.</span></i> Married life was the most sacred thing he knew and he was always thinking of ways to preserve its sanctity. He considered it woman’s duty to be devoted to her husband and to see to the bringing up of her children. He said in this connection that a woman is elevated by the lofty character of her husband, but she must not allow herself to descend to his level if he degenerates.<sup class="footnote-marker">151)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">151) כתובות ס״א ב׳.</span></i> He used to say also that “one should be careful not to hurt his wife, for, being quick to weep, a woman feels herself agrieved at the smallest trifle.”<sup class="footnote-marker">152)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">152) בבא מציעא נ״ט א׳.</span></i>
It was Rav’s greatest care to keep people removed from all temptations and even to prevent them from putting themselves in a position where they might be tempted to sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">153)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">153) סנהדרין ק״ז א׳.</span></i> He used to keep himself from thinking about temptation. When walking with his pupil R. Judah once, they saw a woman walking before them, and Rav said to R. Judah: “Let us hurry and pass this woman so that we need not continue to walk behind Gehenna.”<sup class="footnote-marker">154)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">154) קדושין פּ״א א׳.</span></i> For the same reason he would never attend debates with those of a different faith, and he would say: “Happy is he who repents while still in his full manly vigor.”<sup class="footnote-marker">155)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">155) עבודה זרה י״ט א׳.</span></i>
Rav kept himself clean not only from any sin with regard to women, but he was also very scrupulous in all his other actions. He used to say: “A man should never have a lighter and a heavier measure, so that he has never a chance to use them.”<sup class="footnote-marker">156)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">156) בבא בתרא פּ״ט ב׳.</span></i> In the same way he would say: “if one has a coin whose metal has been lightened, he should not keep it with him, because he may have a chance to use it in a transaction and thereby swindle people.”<sup class="footnote-marker">157)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">157) בבא מציעא נ״ב א׳.</span></i> Concerning a similar matter Rav said; “Whoever lends anything to another person without a witness, tempts the borrower to deny the loan, and this is equivalent to placing stumbling blocks before the blind.”<sup class="footnote-marker">158)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">158) בבא מציעא ע״ה ב׳.</span></i> More than anything else, however Rav fought against corrupt manners and loose morals. He ordained the severest laws and when he saw that their effect was slight, he tried to influence people by little stories which we would weave into his lectures from time to time.
One of these stories is as follows: There was once an apprentice who coveted his master’s wife. The master needed a loan of a certain amount of money to continue his work. The apprentice said to him; “Send me your wife and I will lend you the money you need.”
The master sent his wife off to the apprentice to fetch him the money. The apprentice kept her days. Then the master came to the apprentice and said: “Where is my wife whom I sent to you?” The apprentice answered: “I was through with her immediately and sent her home. But I have heard that a band of young men seized her on the road and misused her.”
“Then what shall I do now?” said the master.
“If you will hear my advice,” answered the apprentice, “you should divorce her.”
“Unfortunately I cannot divorce her,” said the master, “because her marriage contract calls for a large sum of money, and I haven’t got so much.”
“Then I will lend you the money to pay her contract,” answered the apprentice.
The apprentice did as he had promised and lent his master the money to pay his wife’s contract. Thus the master divorced his wife and the apprentice married her immediately afterwards.
When the time came for the master to pay his debt to the apprentice, he had no money to pay and the apprentice forced him to serve him as a slave until he had worked off his debt. Then when the apprentice and his wife sat at the table and entertained each other with food and drink, the master had to stand behind them and watch them kiss each other while he served them — and when he would bring them wine his tears would fall into their cup.
The Almighty could not allow such a crime to go unnoticed and at that moment the doom of Jerusalem was sealed, and the place where such a thing could occur was condemned to be destroyed.<sup class="footnote-marker">159)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">159) גטין נ״ה א׳.</span></i>
Rav related such another tale in a lecture of his: There was once a man who fell sick of desire for a certain woman. Doctors were consulted. They said the man could not be cured until he possessed that woman…. The scholars said: “Let him die, but he shall not have the woman!”
The doctors said: “If you show him the woman undressed there is a chance he may get better.” The scholars replied: “Let him die, but he shall not see the woman undressed.”
At last the doctors said: “Just let him speak with the woman over a screen.” The scholars answered: “If his desire is so strong, he must be allowed to die, but he cannot be permitted to converse with that woman over a screen.”<sup class="footnote-marker">160)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">160) סנהדרין ע״ה ב׳.</span></i>
Besides the question of women, Rav paid a great deal of attention to education. He once set the age for beginning school in his remark to R. Samuel bar Shilet, who was a school teacher in Sura: “Until a child turns six, do not begin to teach him, and if you should ever want to strike a child, use only the sole of a shoe.<sup class="footnote-marker">161)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">161) בבא בתרא כ״א א׳.</span></i> Study too was considered highly important by Rav. He would say: “A man should not willingly stay even one hour away from school.”<sup class="footnote-marker">162)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">162) שבת פּ״ג ב׳.</span></i>
Rav was a “rationalist” in questions of religion, and he used to say: “The Almighty gave us the commandments in order to refine the Jews, as the goldsmith takes gold in his crucible and refines it of the dross.”<sup class="footnote-marker">163)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">163) מדרש שמואל פּרשה ד׳.</span></i>
Rav fought shameless conduct with all his strength. He inveighed in the strongest terms against those who went in false ways and he frequently could not restrain himself from cursing them. He considered backsliding from religious faith to be a form of lax morals. But above all Rav fought for social justice, to protect the weak against the strong. He stood in principle for the workers’ right to freedom of movement when they were hired by the day and he said: “A worker may change his mind about a job he has undertaken even in the middle of the day.”<sup class="footnote-marker">164)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">164) בבא קמא קט״ז ב׳, בבא מציעא י׳ א׳.</span></i>
He attacked employers sharply when they oppressed their workers and he said: “For four things the property of householders comes to ruin: when they withhold the wages of their hired workers, or when they deceive their employees, or when they shift the burden of public service to others, and when they are proud.”<sup class="footnote-marker">165)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">165) סוכה כ״ט ב׳.</span></i> Rav’s fight against those who refused to shoulder their share of public burdens was particularly bitter. This was a consequence of his own nature, for he himself was always prepared to assume responsibility for any community interest. He wanted to see the same sort of devotion on the part of officials to their posts as to the persons whom they loved. The leaders of the people should not feel themselves superior to ordinary folk. Rav said: “Any representative of the people who creates an atmosphere of fear around him, and not for the sake of Heaven, will never have the fortune of seeing his son become a scholar.”<sup class="footnote-marker">166)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">166) ראש השנה י״ז א׳.</span></i>
Rav was particularly angry about proud people and he said: “Whoever is proud and considers himself too good for other people, loses his learning, if he is a scholar,<sup class="footnote-marker">167)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">167) פּסחים ט״ו ב׳.</span></i> and if someone was proud, even though he was not a scholar, Rav said: “Whoever struts about in the garb of a scholar, and is not a scholar, will never be admitted into the company of the Almighty.”<sup class="footnote-marker">168)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">168) בבא בתרא צ״ה א׳.</span></i>
As badly as he hated boastfulness and vanity, Rav dis-liked people who caused excessive fear in their own household. He said: “Whoever causes excessive fear in his own house, drives people to laxity of morals, shedding of blood, and desecration of the Sabbath.”<sup class="footnote-marker">169)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">169) גטין ו׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Speaking about the inhabitants of neighboring cities whom he considered dangerous thieves, he said: “If a citizen of Geresh ever kisses you, count your teeth to see if you have them all. If anybody from K’far P’kud falls into step with you, it is surely because he is pleased by your cloak and wants to take it away from you. If a man from Pumbaditha accompanies you, change your inn, so that he will not know where you are staying.”<sup class="footnote-marker">170)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">170) חולין קכ״ז א׳.</span></i> When he was told of a man who came to Babylon and could not get either food or work, he said: “The rich men of Babylon are destined for hell; they are descended from the mixed multitude of Egyptians who went out with the Jews from Egypt, for only merciful people are descended from father Abraham.”<sup class="footnote-marker">171)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">171) ביצה ל״ב ב׳.</span></i>
As we have said Rav traveled a great deal in Palestine as well as in Babylonia, and even though he considered his voyages burdensome and would say that “A man’s traveling is more difficult than a woman’s traveling,”<sup class="footnote-marker">172)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">172) כתובות כ״ה א׳, סנהדרין כ״ו א׳.</span></i> he loved the work of spreading the Torah with which he occupied himself on his travels. It seemed to him that “the Almighty has made everyone’s trade delightful in his own eyes.”<sup class="footnote-marker">173)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">173) ברכות מ״ג ב׳.</span></i> Still it seems that he grew tired of the traveling and consequently he said: “Any town where the roads go up and down hills makes man and beast old too soon.”<sup class="footnote-marker">174)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">174) ערובין נ״ו א׳.</span></i> Rav learned the value of hospitality on the road, he would often speak about the Patriarchs and their behavior towards strangers and wanderers. He praised Barzilai the Gileadite who brought king David various utensils and foodstuffs when he was in flight before his son Absalom (Samuel II, 17:28). Since the verse mentions the word <span dir="rtl">״קלי״</span> twice, Rav concluded that Barzilai brought two kinds of cooked food and stewed fruits.<sup class="footnote-marker">175)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">175) עבודה זרה ל״ה ב׳.</span></i>
He interpreted the fact that David sent ten of his men to Nabal the Carmelite (Samuel I, 25) saying that because Nabal gave the ten to eat, although the Bible does not mention the fact, God granted him ten more days to live in return for the meal.<sup class="footnote-marker">176)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">176) ראש השנה י״ח א׳.</span></i> Rav said also that if Jonathan, son of Saul, had given David two loaves of bread when he told him to flee from his father’s wrath, David would not have had to take any bread from Ahimelech and the priests of Nob would not have been slain.<sup class="footnote-marker">177)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">177) סנהדרין ק״ד א׳.</span></i>
As we have said Rav was friendly with hunters and shepherds, from whom he learned a great deal about wild and domestic animals.<sup class="footnote-marker">178)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">178) מועד קטן י״א א׳, סנהדרין ה׳ ב׳.</span></i> Rav allowed his own son Chiya to shoot with a bow.<sup class="footnote-marker">179)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">179) נדרים ע״ו ב׳.</span></i> In general hunting was not uncommon among the Jews of Babylonia. The story goes that a certain “Tabi Rishba” would set out nets and snares to trap birds and animals,<sup class="footnote-marker">180)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">180) שבת י״ז ב׳.</span></i> and another named “Joseph Rishba” engaged in the same trade.<sup class="footnote-marker">181)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">181) שבת ק״ל א׳.</span></i>
Rav’s aphorisms are very instructive:
“The curse of a scholar,” he said, “even if spoken conditionally will always be realized.”<sup class="footnote-marker">182)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">182) מכות י״א א׳.</span></i> When a person gives a present to his friend, he should tell him about it.<sup class="footnote-marker">183)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">183) שבת י׳ ב׳.</span></i> Even the casual conversation of a scholar demands careful analysis.<sup class="footnote-marker">184)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">184) סוכה כ״א ב׳, עבודה זרה י״ט א׳.</span></i> The camel wanted to have horns so the ears he had previously were cut off.<sup class="footnote-marker">185)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">185) סנהדרין ק״ו א׳.</span></i> A prisoner cannot break jail by himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">186)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">186) ברכות ה׳ א׳, סנהדרין צ״ה א׳.</span></i> You need not be surprised that your offspring can sometimes teach you wisdom.<sup class="footnote-marker">187)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">187) יבמות ס״ג א׳.</span></i> One should not speak insultingly of a Gentile in a Proselyte’s presence.<sup class="footnote-marker">188)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">188) סנהדרין צ״ד א׳.</span></i> “If a hound barks at you, you may enter the house, but if a bitch barks at you, do not enter the house.”<sup class="footnote-marker">189)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">189) ערובין פּ״ז א׳.</span></i> This quotation is ordinarily explained as meaning that a person may enter his son-in-law’s house even if he growls like a dog, but should not enter his son’s house if his wife howls like a bitch.
A Jew, even though he has sinned, is still a Jew.<sup class="footnote-marker">190)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">190) סנהדרין מ״ד ב׳.</span></i> On another occasion Rav advised one of his students to take to skinning carcasses in the streets rather than be dependent on charity.<sup class="footnote-marker">191)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">191) בבא קמא ק״י א׳.</span></i> Whose hope lies on another person’s table lives in a world of gloom.<sup class="footnote-marker">192)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">192) ביצה ל״ב ב׳.</span></i> Pious people regard their money more highly than their lives, for they come by their money with difficulty since they do not practice robbery.<sup class="footnote-marker">193)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">193) סוטה י״ב א׳.</span></i>
Rav’s aphorisms which speak of things which are found in threes, are particularly interesting:
Three sorts of people should be guarded: sick men, brides and grooms.<sup class="footnote-marker">194)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">194) ברכות נ״ד ב׳.</span></i> There are three sins from which one cannot guard oneself: thinking of sin, inattention during prayer, hearing or repeating gossip.<sup class="footnote-marker">195)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">195) בבא בתרא קס״ד ב׳.</span></i> Three on whom God should have mercy, so that they may be not spoiled: a good king, a good year and a good dream.<sup class="footnote-marker">196)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">196) ברכות נ״ה ב׳.</span></i> Three things shorten men’s lives when a person is offered the privilege of reading from the Bible in the Synagogue and refuses, when he is offered the privilege of blessing the wine and he refuses, and when he lives in grand style.<sup class="footnote-marker">197)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">197) ברכות נ״ה ב׳.</span></i> Three things which lengthen men’s lives if much time is spent on them: prayer, eating at the table, and cleaning the body.<sup class="footnote-marker">198)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">198) ברכות נ״ד ב׳.</span></i> Three sorts of persons whom God loves: one who never gets angry, one who never gets drunk, and one who is not stubborn.<sup class="footnote-marker">199)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">199) פּסחים קי״ג א׳.</span></i>
Rav dealt with hundreds of religious problems, as well as with problems of ordinary human conduct; in addition he had to settle hundreds of disputes concerning property, or the sale or purchase of various objects. He even had to judge a case once in which a thief sold his loot to the original owner.<sup class="footnote-marker">200)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">200) בבא מציעא ט״ז ב׳.</span></i>
We can see that Rav had a sharp eye for people and events. He was incomparably sympathetic and interested in all phases of life. He always kept the limits of propriety in mind. His dearest wish was to see the Jewish people secure in their national existence. He overestimated people in his kindness and yet he was very concerned for the truth. He took a deep interest in the differences in human character and tried to learn the true worth of all human occupations. When teaching his students he was very watchful of their behavior and immediately detected any inattention. He was very strict in demanding religious regularity and did not recognize any obstacles in the way of observance.
It is related that when Rav came to Babylonia, he saw how lightly the Jews treated certain commandments, for instance, how they would mix meat and dairy dishes as though there were no law on the subject which forbade one to leave meat without special care. Consequently he was “severe” on all these questions even though in other cases he tried to make the legal prescriptions easier when he saw that times required it. In these matters he was very meticulous in discovering exactly the proper change required by the times or the case. For instance, when a case arose concerning oaths, he ruled differently concerning the oath a person took to guard anything that was given or lent to him, and which he later loaned to another or refused to return, and concerning the oath a person took to do or not to do something.<sup class="footnote-marker">201)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">201) ירושלמי שבועות פרק ח׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i> Rav also ruled differently concerning “sacred property” when it was something which a person had voluntarily decided to give to God, that is to the priests, and when it was the gifts which a person was obliged to give to the priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">202)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">202) ירושלמי דמאי פרק ז׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i> Rav made the same distinction in dealing with the difference between selling and giving away an object.<sup class="footnote-marker">203)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">203) בבא בתרא נ״ג א׳.</span></i> He said also that if a man transfers his property to his wife he may no longer have its profits. But if he sells his field to his wife and she pays him with her own money, he may have the use of its fruits.<sup class="footnote-marker">204)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">204) ירושלמי כתובות פרק ט׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
Rav’s ruling was also quite different in the case of an “original marriage contract,” which he considered as the price which a man had to pay for his wife, and an “addition to the contract,” which he considered a gift. In questions concerning the transfer of property he considered it to be of the highest importance by whom and under what circumstances the property was being transferred.<sup class="footnote-marker">205)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">205) כתובות פ״ו א׳.</span></i>
These laws seemed particularly important in Rav’s eyes because of the difference in the rights of a priest and an ordinary Jew, as well as between a Jew and a Gentile, or when an ordinary Jew owned something which he had inherited from his mother, which his mother had from her father, who was a priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">206)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">206) ערכין ל״ג א׳.</span></i>
Rav held likewise that a man might change his mind in the middle of a transaction. He therefore established a rule that “if a man begins something conditionally and then stops it unconditionally, we may assume that he has changed his mind.”<sup class="footnote-marker">207)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">207) כתובות ע״ב ב׳.</span></i>
Since Rav felt the responsibility of a leader of his people he worried about the regulations governing all the Jewish cities and all the academies, the field work and the draining of swamps. At the same time he enacted laws concerning Jewish life and settled disputes.
The rules which tradition has handed down as those which guided Rav in his decisions are very interesting. Rav said that no man would lie about an event that had occurred in public.<sup class="footnote-marker">208)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">208) בכורות ל״ו א׳.</span></i> A man does not leave an oath as an inheritance to his children, since children cannot perform an act for their father which their father had sworn to do.<sup class="footnote-marker">209)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">209) שבועות מ״ח א׳, ירושלמי שבועות פרק ז׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i>
He felt also that a dying man would not lie.<sup class="footnote-marker">210)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">210) ירושלמי בבא קמא פרק ט׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i>
If a person changes the conditions of a thing or sets it down in a place which is unsuited for it and it is later damaged by a second person, the latter is not required to pay the damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">211)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">211) בבא קמא כ׳ א׳.</span></i>
Although a Jew is forbidden to receive interest on money loaned, he may lend his own children money at interest so that they may know the feelings of one who has to pay it.<sup class="footnote-marker">212)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">212) בבא מציעא ע״ה א׳.</span></i>

Shmuel Yarchinaa of Nehardea

H<small>E WAS CALLED</small> S<small>HMUEL</small> Y<small>ARCHINAA</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פ״ה ב׳.</span></i> although his real name was Shmuel ben Aba Hakohen. Together with Rav he was one of the first founders of the Babylonian Talmud. Shmuel lived in Nehardea where he conducted an academy and after the death of Rav Sheila he received the title <span dir="rtl">״ריש סידרא״</span> (the Head of the Academy).
Concerning the relations of Shmuel and Rav it is impossible to arrive at definite conclusions. At times it appears that Shmuel was an intimate friend of Rav and even dependent on him.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה כ״ב א׳.</span></i> At other times Shmuel directed his questions to Rav as to his master.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות כ״ב א׳, ירושלמי שבת פרק ג׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> But sometimes he opposed the opinions of Rav and maintained contrary ideas.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת נ״ג א׳, חולין מ״ח ב׳.</span></i>
Nevertheless it is related that when Rav died Shmuel rent thirteen garments and said: “The man of whom I had so much use, has departed.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ד א׳.</span></i>
Regarding Shmuel’s scholarship it was said that he was primarily an astronomer versed in the ways of the stars, the moon and the planets and that he could calculate the seasons and the months. It is also known that Shmuel once declared: “The paths of heaven are known to me like the streets of Nehardea.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות נ״ח א׳.</span></i> Another time he said: “I could calculate the leap years for all the Jews.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה כ׳ ב׳.</span></i>
In addition Shmuel was also known to be a learned doctor and acquainted with the laws of nature.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדה כ״ה ב׳.</span></i> When Rabbi Jochanan wrote to him, he addressed him as “our outstanding comrade in Babylonia”.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין צ״ה ב׳.</span></i> Other scholars referred to him as the “lion” and allegorically called him “the lion, the king of the laws.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ל״ט א׳, מנחות ל״ח ב׳.</span></i>
Due to the great honor which was accorded to Shmuel, even his father was referred to as “the Father of Shmuel”, although he was a prominent man in his own right and was highly respected by the Nasi. He probably also occupied an important post among Babylonian Jewry for we find him addressing questions to Rabbi Jehudah ha-Nasi of a general religious nature such as the one concerning the order of “Havdalah” when a holiday begins on a Saturday evening.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים ק״ג א׳.</span></i> On another occasion Shmuel’s father visited Palestine in order to ask Rabbi Jehudah ha-Nasi concerning a problem of money matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי בבא מציעא פרק ד׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
It was said of Shmuel’s father that he was a silk merchant and Rabbi Jehudah ben Bathyra once sent him a message that he wanted to buy some silk. When Shmuel’s father arrived with the merchandise he was told that Rabbi Jehudah had no intention of buying any. But Shmuel’s father said: “I have more faith in your words than in your money.” To this Rabbi Jehudah replied: “Because you have believed my words, you shall have a son who shall equal the prophet Samuel.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מדרש שמואל פּרשה י׳.</span></i>
In his youth Shmuel studied with his father and later he went to Palestine. There he became the physician of Rabbi Jehudah ha-Nasi and cured the latter of an eye disease. It was said at that time that the Nasi regretted that he could not ordain Shmuel. No cause for the inability of the Nasi to ordain Shmuel is mentioned and it may therefore be assumed that since Rabbi Jehudah was sick he could not convoke the other scholars to grant ordination. Shmuel consoled him by saying that most likely it was foretold even before Adam that he was destined to be a wise man but not an ordained Rabbi.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פּ״ה ב׳.</span></i>
Although Shmuel devoted much study to medicine he declared that three ailments he could not cure: the effect of eating bitter fruit on an empty stomach; the effect of wearing a moist flax belt and the effect of eating a meal and then not walking at least a distance of four ells.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא קי״ג ב׳.</span></i>
Since many of the people in the neighborhood of Shmuel suffered from eye ailments, he found a salve which became famous. But although he was the discoverer of the salve he nevertheless declared that a drop of cold water in the morning and washing one’s hands and feet with warm water in the evening are better than any salve in the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ק״ח ב׳.</span></i> Another time he said that he who does not wipe his face well after washing it, his skin will become rough.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קל״ג ב׳.</span></i> For one who suffers from a cold it is permissible to make a fire during the Sabbath, even if the weather is as warm as in the middle of the summer.<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קכ״ט א׳.</span></i>
In accordance with his medical theories he listed the foods that should be given to a person who faints from hunger.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא פּ״ג ב׳.</span></i> He also used the order of the Hebrew alphabet to explain his medical ideas. Thus he said that the letters <span dir="rtl">נ׳ ס׳ ע׳</span> are the initials of <span dir="rtl">״נונא סמא לעיניא״</span> which means that eating fish is good for the eyes”.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדרים נ״ד ב׳</span></i>
Among Shmuel’s friends there was a Gentile astrologer Ablat with whom he discussed the heavenly bodies. Shmuel proved to him that astrology did not influence the life of the Jews for by means of prayers they could change any decree that the stars might foretell for them.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קנ׳׳ז ב׳.</span></i>
After the death of king Artaban and his successor Ardeshir, the throne of Persia and Babylonia was ascended by king Sapor I who was a friend of Shmuel. (In the Talmud this king is known as “Shavour Malka.”) This king declared a war against Capadocia and conquered its capital where he slew 12,000 Jews. But Shmuel did not mourn this event for he was of the opinion that they had deserved their fate for fighting against Shavour Malka.<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ו א׳.</span></i>
Shmuel was courageous in his convictions and he did not fear to attend the debates at “Be Avidan” and he also argued matters of faith with king Sapor.<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין צ״ח א׳.</span></i>
It may be assumed that upon his return from Palestine Shmuel brought the Mishna of Rabbi Jehudah ha-Nasi which he taught to his pupils. He was also the first one who allowed himself to add matters that were not included in the Mishna. He usually prefaced his additions by the words: “Something is missing and it should be studied as follows.”<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ל״ד ב׳, ביצה ל״א ב׳, קדושין ל׳ט א׳.</span></i>
The regulations which emanated from Shmuel’s academy are usually referred to as the “teachings of the house of Shmuel.” It is related that in the academy of Shmuel there was a blind scholar who knew the entire Mishna by heart and who arranged the “Boraithoth” of Shmuel.<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ביצה ט״ז ב׳.</span></i>
From Shmuel’s teachings it is evident that he always sought to find more lenient interpretations of the laws even against the opinions of other scholars. Thus he ruled that in regulations to mourning the law is always according to the less strict interpretation.<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין מ״ו ב׳.</span></i> On another occasion when the regulations of fast days were discussed he said that the law was as Rabbi Meir said, because he believed Rabbi Meir to be the most lenient in these matters. But when he discovered that Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel was even more lenient in his interpretations, he ruled that the law was according to Rabban Simeon.<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית י״ח א׳.</span></i>
It appears that Shmuel attempted to introduce some radical innovation in the matter of fasts when he said: “There is no other public fast in Babylonia aside from the ninth day of Ab.”<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים נ״ד ב׳.</span></i> But the exact nature of the innovation is not entirely clear. It appears that he was not a believer in the merit of fasts for he said that “one who spends too much time in fasts may be called a sinner.”<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית י״א א׳.</span></i>
Among other innovations of Shmuel mention should be made of his modifications of the Sabbatical regulations.<sup class="footnote-marker">30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת י״ט ב׳, כ״ב א׳, נ״א א׳.</span></i> Among these he permitted lighting a fire for a woman in childbirth<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קכ״ט א׳.</span></i> and cooling red hot metal which may happen to lie in a public thoroughfare and thus to constitute a danger to passersby.<sup class="footnote-marker">32)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת מ״ב א׳, זבחים צ״א ב׳.</span></i>
He also ruled in regard to Passover dishes, that the law did not require the destruction of dishes used for leavened food before Passover, but such dishes could be put away during Passover and be used after the holidays. He also permitted that dishes used for cold leavened foods could be used as Passover dishes.<sup class="footnote-marker">33)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים ל׳ א׳ וב׳.</span></i>
Shmuel’s contemporaries did not think highly of his abilities as an expounder. He was in the habit of introducing fantastic interpretations into the Biblical verses. Although these interpretations were very interesting they bore no relation to the text which they were supposed to explain. Thus he said that the only difference between his days and the time of Messiah was the subjection to government. This was a very novel statement but it was hardly related to the verse: “The poor shall not cease from the earth”, upon which he based it.<sup class="footnote-marker">34)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ל״ד ב׳, שבת ס״ג א׳.</span></i>
In money matters or problems pertaining to personal rights the scholars always preferred the opinions of Shmuel to those of Rav.<sup class="footnote-marker">35)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בכורות מ״ט ב׳.</span></i> Thus it was also said that “he who does not agree with the opinions of Shmuel does not know the laws pertaining to damages”.<sup class="footnote-marker">36)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי קדושין פרק א׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i>
Shmuel strived to adapt Jewish laws in money matters to those of the country. This is evident from the rule which he established that “the law of the land is the law.”<sup class="footnote-marker">37)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין י׳ ב׳.</span></i> He likewise introduced the principle that the burden of the proof lay with the plaintiff.<sup class="footnote-marker">38)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא מ״ו א׳.</span></i> A similar rule established by him declared that in the case of doubt concerning a debt, the doubter had to offer proof that it had not been paid.<sup class="footnote-marker">39)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ע״ו ב׳.</span></i>
Despite that fact that Shmuel Yarchinaa did not receive ordination from the Nasi in Palestine he is referred to in the Babylonian Talmud on numerous occasions as “Mar Shmuel” and in the Jerusalem Talmud we find him referred to as “Rabbi” on three occasions.<sup class="footnote-marker">40)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּאה פרק ד׳ הלכה ה׳, שקלים פרק ד׳ הלכה ד׳, נדרים פרק ב׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>
When the scholars discussed the margin of profit allowed before the price of an article could be considered exorbitant and the transaction invalid, Shmuel set the margin of profit at one sixth of the price of the article.<sup class="footnote-marker">41)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא מ׳ ב׳, בבא בתרא צ׳ ב׳.</span></i>
From statements uttered by Shmuel we may conclude that he was dissatisfied with the leaders of Jewish communal life of his time and whose honesty he doubted. He therefore said that “as soon as one becomes a representative of the community he immediately acquires riches”. According to the concepts of that time, every “leader” had to come from a family bearing some taint. Shmuel explained this popular belief by saying: “Why was the rule of Saul so brief? Because his family was untainted.”<sup class="footnote-marker">42)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא כ״ב ב׳.</span></i>
In accordance with his medical convictions, Shmuel believed in frequent washing and he said: “The dust which gathers on one’s head will blind one if he does not wash frequently. The dust on garments which are not washed frequently leads to moodiness. The dust on one’s body leads to filth.”<sup class="footnote-marker">43)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדרים פ״א א׳.</span></i>
Of the friendship of king Sapor (Shavour Malka) it is interesting to relate that whenever Shmuel visited the king, he would perform acrobatic feats; thus it was told that he would raise eight beakers full of wine without spilling a drop of their contents.<sup class="footnote-marker">44)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוכה נ״ג א׳.</span></i>
Of Shmuel’s children it is known that one of his sons died during his father’s lifetime.<sup class="footnote-marker">45)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן י״ח א׳.</span></i> Regarding the clash between Rav and Shmuel it is said that during their first meeting Shmuel invited Rav to his house and offered him indigestible food. Rav thereupon cursed him that his children should die and this curse came true with the death of Shmuel’s son.<sup class="footnote-marker">46)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ק״ח א׳.</span></i> Of his other children there remained three beautiful daughters. Two of these were imprisoned during the wars of Rome against Babylonia and were taken to Palestine where they remained.<sup class="footnote-marker">47)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות כ״ג א׳.</span></i> Shmuel’s third daughter was captured during an attack on the city of Nehardea and was married by a non-Jew. She later sought to convert her husband. The son which she bore him is mentioned in the Talmud as Rav Mari bar Giora and also as Rav Mari the son of Rachel, the daughter of Shmuel.<sup class="footnote-marker">48)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות מ״ה ב׳.</span></i>
Shmuel always wanted to adapt Jewish laws to the laws of the land insofar as the former were not deeply grounded in religion. He was not always successful, however, for the other scholars failed to share his point of view. Thus the Persians held that one acquired the right of possession only after ownership over a period of forty years. Jewish law called for ownership over a period of three years only. Shmuel likewise wanted to introduce the Persian law according to which a wealthy man could appropriate the land of the poor in exchange for the taxes on the land which he paid to the government.
He questioned the principle of the need of a majority when rendering a verdict in money matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">49)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא צ׳׳ב ב׳.</span></i> He often preferred the opinions of individuals, which were not shared by the majority, when these individuals gave a strict interpretation of the law that was not in conflict with the Mishna.<sup class="footnote-marker">50)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה י״ח ב׳, יבמות פ״ג א׳.</span></i> He was also of the opinion that customs accepted in a Jewish community carried more weight and could modify a law.<sup class="footnote-marker">51)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא קי״ב ב׳, שבועות מ״ה א׳.</span></i>
Shmuel also invalidated forced divorces in cases where there was no compulsion at the time of the marriage and where he had not done anything to justify the court in forcing him to grant a divorce to his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">52)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין פ״ח ב׳.</span></i>
Wishing to aid the oppressed and the weak Shmuel established humanitarian laws for widows and orphans. He thus ruled that movable property which was inherited by orphans who depended on their inheritance for their sustenance, should be sold at once.<sup class="footnote-marker">53)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ק׳ ב׳.</span></i> He also allowed lending money that was left to orphans on interest.<sup class="footnote-marker">54)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא ע׳ א׳.</span></i>
He who registers his property in the name of his wife — Shmuel said — may afterward only manage that property. It is not to be considered that such a man deprives his children of their inheritance but rather that he wishes them to respect their mother more highly as a result of being dependent on her.<sup class="footnote-marker">55)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא קמ״ד א׳.</span></i>
A widow — Shmuel ruled — who finds some object becomes its sole owner.<sup class="footnote-marker">56)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות צ״ו א׳.</span></i> Also when her “dowry” (<span dir="rtl">״כתובה״</span>) is about to be paid, the value of the garments she wears should not be deducted from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">57)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות נ״ד א׳.</span></i>
At that time there was practiced in Babylonia the custom of declaring a moratorium on all debts during the Sabbatical year. The only exception to this custom were cases when instituted by Hillel the Old, allowing a creditor to transfer the lender wrote a so called <span dir="rtl">״פרוזבול״</span> a “declaration” the debt to a court before the Sabbatical year, so that he could collect after that time. Shmuel did not approve this custom but we have no knowledge of his plans for any reform. At first he objected to the idea that any three persons could declare themselves as a court and could write “Prosbols”. Later he objected to the principle of the “Prosbol” and said that if he could he would do away with it entirely.<sup class="footnote-marker">58)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ל״ו ב׳.</span></i>
It is improbable, however, that Shmuel wished the Sabbatical year moratorium to be enforced in all its implications. More probably he wished that all debts contracted without any definite condition concerning the Sabbatical year should be payable after that year. But being unable to put this view into practice, he merely warned that not all courts can write a “Prosbol”. Later he more specifically declared that only the courts of Sura and Nehardea could write “Prosbols”. All of these confusing statements make it impossible to ascertain just what Shmuel sought to achieve. Thus we find two contradictory statements in this matter, both quoted by his pupil Rav Jehudah in his name. The first statement states that “if one loans money to his friend for ten years, the Sabbatical invalidates the debt”.<sup class="footnote-marker">59)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכות ג׳ א׳.</span></i> Immediately after that we find the statement that “if one loans money to his friend for ten years, the debt remains valid”.<sup class="footnote-marker">60)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכות ג׳ ב׳.</span></i>
One thing remains certain, that although he did not succeed in doing away with the “Prosbol” altogether, nor did he reestablish the old Biblical law concerning the moratorium of the Sabbatical year, he at least exerted an influence that henceforth the significance of the “Prosbol” was diminished. He further ruled that orphans do not need a “Prosbol” and that the Sabbatical year could not void debts owed to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">61)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא ל״ז א׳.</span></i>
Like Rav he also insisted on the observance of all the moral regulations both so far as men and women were concerned. When the people of the city of Nehardea showed a certain amount of levity toward marriage ceremonies and divorces, Shmuel declared that “one who is not thoroughly acquainted with marriage ceremonies and divorce procedures must maintain no attitude toward them”.<sup class="footnote-marker">62)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ו׳ א׳.</span></i>
Shmuel considered marriage to be the most important moral principle of society. When he saw that people took the matter lightly because they could wed a woman with a ring worth less than a penny, he ruled that if one weds a woman even with a date, which in Babylonia is of very little value, the marriage is sanctified because a date is more valuable in other lands.<sup class="footnote-marker">63)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין י״ב א׳.</span></i>
It is characteristic of Shmuel that he put but little trust in the chastity of women. He therefore was strict not to believe the testimony of women who had been held captive among pagans and who later declared that they had not been defiled.<sup class="footnote-marker">64)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות כ״ג א׳.</span></i> If a bride became pregnant while still living in her father’s house even though it may have been known that the bridegroom was the father of the child, Shmuel nevertheless ruled that such a child was of doubtful parentage and that no Jew may later marry it, for a bride who could allow herself to conceive before the marriage ceremony could not be trusted as being of unquestionable conduct against other men.<sup class="footnote-marker">65)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ס״ט ב׳.</span></i>
In the attempt to keep men and women apart he declared that may not employ a woman servant either young or old, nor should one greet a woman in the street that she may not have to answer the greeting.<sup class="footnote-marker">66)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ע׳ א׳.</span></i> Even the voice of a woman he held to be sufficient to inspire evil thoughts in men.<sup class="footnote-marker">67)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות כ״ד א׳.</span></i> He therefore ruled that a man may not remain alone with any of the 19 degrees of relatives which one is forbidden to marry according to the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">68)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין פ״א ב׳.</span></i>
When Rav arranged the prayers, he was sometimes aided by Shmuel. Shmuel likewise arranged a short prayer for travellers who have not the time to recite the entire “Shmone Esre”.<sup class="footnote-marker">69)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות כ״ט א׳.</span></i>
Shmuel was known for his great modesty. He believed that it was the modesty of Hillel that was responsible for the fact that all of his opinions were accepted by the people. He also said that the quality of modesty was also transferred to Hillel’s disciples.<sup class="footnote-marker">70)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין י״ג ב׳.</span></i>
A like measure of modesty Shmuel exhibited toward his disciples. If one of them called his attention to a contradiction in his statements he never sought to justify the contradiction or to claim that he had been misunderstood, as some scholars were in the habit of doing; instead he admitted the correctness of the remark or he remained silent.<sup class="footnote-marker">71)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין ע״ד א׳.</span></i> Often he opposed the opinions of Rav nevertheless he would also concede whenever Rav was correct. When a pupil once asked him whether a certain regulation pertaining to <span dir="rtl">״ערובין״</span> was to be practiced according to the opinion of Rav or of Shmuel, he admitted that Rav’s opinion was the right one.<sup class="footnote-marker">72)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין צ׳ ב׳.</span></i>
At times he even tried to adapt his system to that of Rav.<sup class="footnote-marker">73)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא ק״ז א׳.</span></i> When Rav visited Shmuel and spent a Sabbath with him, Shmuel commanded the members of his household to follow all the observances of Rav.<sup class="footnote-marker">74)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין צ״ד א׳.</span></i>
As was related above, both Rav and Shmuel had difficulties with the Nasi in Palestine regarding ordination. Rav’s objections were not so great because he did receive partial ordination. But Rav was angry that when he asked Rabban Gamliel III to grant him a full ordination, the latter said that he could grant him no more than his father did.
Shmuel, on the other hand, did not receive even a limited ordination. He also never tried to change this state of affairs. When Rabbi Jehudah N’siah I (the grandson of Rabbi Jehudah Hanasi) permitted the use of oil bought from pagans and the news of this regulation was received in Babylonia, Rav refused to abide by it. Shmuel at that time ordered him to obey it and threatened to expose him as a “dissenting elder.” <span dir="ltr">(זקן ממרא)</span><sup class="footnote-marker">75)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי עבודה זרה פרק ב׳ הלכה ט׳.</span></i>
It is probable that Shmuel was most incensed at the fact that the Jews of Babylonia had to depend upon messengers from Palestine to inform them of leap years as well as of the date of the holidays. The Jews of Babylonia had to celebrate an additional day each holiday because of this custom despite the fact that Shmuel had calculated astronomically the order of the leap years and the exact time of the holidays.
He even wrote a so called “Boraitha of the Secrets of the Leap Year”, from which anybody could reckon the time of a leap year. But this “Boraitha” was not adopted by the scholars and it was said that Aba, the father of Rabbi Simlai, once asked Shmuel a question concerning the leap year which the latter could not answer. Aba then said to him: “If you cannot answer my question, there must be many other matters concerning which you are ignorant.”<sup class="footnote-marker">76)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה כ׳ ב׳.</span></i>

Mar Ukba the Exilarch

T<small>HE</small> J<small>EWS OF</small> B<small>ABYLONIA</small> were isolated from the non-Jewish environment. This isolation was enhanced by the fact that they possessed an autonomous administration which regulated their religious and national life. To the central government they merely had to pay taxes in exchange for which they were promised protection, insofar as governments could protect their citizens at that time.
The taxes that were levied on the community were generally not paid to the government directly. Instead there were agents who were empowered to collect the taxes. There thus came into being a class of middlemen who acted as go betweens of the Jews and the government. Every time that one of these go betweens had to hand over the taxes gathered to the king or to his representative, he had an opportunity to request more efficient protection or to exert his influence against those regulations which the Jews considered to be harmful. Since the Jews knew that these men were close to government circles, they accorded them authority also in internal Jewish matters and in time these men assumed the right of expressing opinions in all internal Jewish matters.
The “Exilarch” was such a representative of the Jews and his authority extended over the entire region about the Persian gulf and between the Tigris river on the West to the Indian border on the East. The influence of the “Exilarch” was still further enhanced by the coincidence that like the Nasi in Palestine he was also a descendant of the royal house of David.
We may assume that not all those who bore the title of Exilarch were generous in their relations with the people. The Talmud refers to Exilarchs who “rule over Israel with the rod and the cane” as against the “Nasi” of Palestine, the descendant of Hillel who devoted himself to cultivating the knowledge of the Torah among the children.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ה׳ א׳, הוריות י״א ב׳.</span></i>
Unfortunately there exists no chronological record of the Exilarchs. The Talmud only mentions four or five of them by name and it is difficult to determine who preceded whom. A more exhaustive list is offered in the “Chronicle” of R. Jose but many of the names mentioned in that work have been proved by historians to be incorrect.
According to “The Chronicle of Rav Sherira Gaon,” Mar Ukba succeeded Rav Huna to the office of Exilarch. Rav Huna lived at the time of Rabbi Jehudah Hanasi. But there exists a statement in the Jerusalem Talmud to the effect that Mar Ukba once sent a letter to the Exilarch chiding him for his custom of going to sleep and waking in the morning to the sounds of musical instruments.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי מגלה פרק ג׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i> This statement is interpreted by some to indicate that Mar Ukba was not an Exilarch. However, it is possible that at the time he wrote the letter he was not the Exilarch but that he later assumed that office.
It is known that when Rav came to Babylonia he was appointed by the then Exilarch to be in charge of weights and measurements in the market place of Nehardea. While holding this office, Rav did not fulfill his duties to the satisfaction of the Exilarch who had him arrested.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי בבא בתרא פרק ה׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i> We may assume that the Exilarch referred to in the above story was not Mar Ukba for he was a kindly and pious man and he would never allow a man like Rav to be arrested.
Another proof that Mar Ukba was an Exilarch is the fact that he was kept informed concerning the order of the leap years.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה י״ט ב׳.</span></i> He also found two letters from the high court in Palestine that were sent to a previous Exilarch in which the high court announced its decision to declare a leap year.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי מגלה פרק א׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>
One thing is certain, that at some time during his career Mar Ukba was only head of the court. In this capacity he conducted an academy and exerted an influence on the development of Jewish life in Babylonia.
It is possible that Mar Ukba was a son of the Exilarch Rav Huna and succeeded him to the office. The Exilarch of the time of Rav may have been a different person. But of Mar Ukba’s father we know only that he was an important man in the Jewish community. When the question arose as to how long one must wait after eating meat before he may eat cheese, Mar Ukba said: “In this respect I am as vinegar is to wine when compared to my father. Whenever he ate meat he would not eat cheese until the following day.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין ק״ה א׳.</span></i>
Mar Ukba held court in the city of Kafri in Babylonia.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין מ״ד ב׳.</span></i> Shmuel Yarchinaa was one of the associate judges of Mar Ukba. Although was like a pupil of Shmuel and often quoted his statements, he nevertheless presided over the court. Thus it was related that whenever the two were engaged in study, Mar Ukba would sit four ells in front of Shmuel as one does in front of his master; but when they were sitting in judgement the order was reversed and Shmuel occupied a particularly low seat.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן ט״ז ב׳.</span></i> Shmuel knew how to honor Mar Ukba and he told his pupil that he should consider Mar Ukba as the master of his master.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת נ״ה א׳.</span></i>
Mar Ukba often quoted laws in the name of Shmuel.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין פ״א א׳, בבא קמא קי״ב ב׳.</span></i> It is also probable that Shmuel imparted to him some of his medical knowledge for we find an instance of Rabbi Yanai of Palestine who sent to Mar Ukba for some eye salve of Shmuel.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ק״ח ב׳.</span></i> Similar instances relate that when Rav Acha bar Joseph felt a pain near his heart, he came to Mar Ukba for treatment.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ק״מ א׳.</span></i> Mar Ukba followed a custom, which he probably adopted from Shmuel, of not sitting in judgement on hot days.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין ס״ח א׳.</span></i>
Aside from being a pupil of Shmuel, Mar Ukba apparently also studied with Shmuel’s father and with Levi ben Sisi.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ק״ח ב׳, מועד קטן כ״ו ב׳.</span></i>
The stories that were told of Mar Ukba’s generosity are of great interest. As he was blessed with great wealth, and his wife was also of a kind nature, he could distribute as much as he chose. Thus it was told that a poor man lived in the neighborhood of Mar Ukba and he wanted to aid him secretly lest the man refuse to take charity. He therefore placed four silver coins on the doorstep of the poor man so that he could easily notice them as he enters his house. When Mar Ukba saw that the man bought food with the money he repeated the same procedure for many days. But the beneficiary of these gifts once decided to find out who his benefactor was and he waited in his house all day until he heard a commotion at the door. As the door opened Mar Ukba fled and as he was being pursued he jumped into a lime pit and he burned his ankles.
Another story concerns a poor neighbor of Mar Ukba to whom he sent four hundred silver coins every year on the eve of the Day of Atonement. One time he sent the money with his son who returned, bringing the money back, and declared that those people did not need it since he saw them using valuable wines. Mar Ukba was angered with his son and said: “If that poor man is used to a luxurious life, the money should be given to him.”
Mar Ukba’s piety and kindness is also evident from his will. As he approached death, he asked that an account be given to him of the money that he had spent for charity. Finding the sum not to be more than seven thousand dinars, he was saddened and said: “Are these all the provisions that I have prepared for such a long trip?” He then commanded that half of his wealth should be distributed to the poor after his death.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ס״ז ב׳.</span></i>
Mar Ukba’s fame spread as far as Palestine and when the scholars of that country wrote to him they addressed him as “the one whose nobility is equal to the nobility of Moses who was like a son to Bathya the daughter of Pharaoh.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ל״א ב׳</span></i>
It is also related that when a son of his brother-in-law died, Mar Ukba wished to observe thirty days of mourning out of respect for the feelings of his wife, and Rav Huna, the pupil of Rav, then came to console him.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן ב׳ ב׳.</span></i>
At about the same time it occurred that a student named Gneiva had a dispute with Mar Ukba which greatly saddened the latter. The same Gneiva also disputed the opinions of Rav<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי עבודה זרה פרק ב׳ הלכה ח׳.</span></i> although on other occasions he quoted the decisions of Rav.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות כ״ה א׳, עבודה זרה ל״ו ב׳.</span></i> Because of this tendency to dispute, Gneiva was called the “half educated” by Rav Hisda and Rav Huna. Rashi interprets this nickname to signify “one who disputes”.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ל״א ב׳.</span></i>
Mar Ukba then turned to Rabbi Elazar ben Pedath, in Palestine, with the following question: “There are people who rise against me and I can report them to the government. What shall I do? Rabbi Elazar replied to him with a verse from Psalms: — I have thought that I will guard my path from sinning with my tongue; I will make a lock for my mouth as long as the wicked one is confrontong me. Mar Ukba replied with another verse from Psalms: — Wait for God’s help and hope on Him. Rabbi Elazar answered him by interpreting the verse to mean: — Hope to God that He will overthrow your enemies.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ז׳ א׳.</span></i>
The story ends that Gneiva finally fell into the hands of the government and was condemned to death.<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי גטין פרק ו׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i>

Raba bar Avuha

T<small>HROUGHOUT THE LIFETIME</small> of Shmuel Yarchinaa, no one dared to attempt to instal another man as head of the academy of Sura instead of Rav. The academy of Nehardea therefore remained the only center of Jewish spiritual life in Babylonia. All decisions pertaining to religious conduct emanated from there and the political representation of the Jews of the Persian empire was concentrated in that city.
After the death of Shmuel Yarchinaa, the academy of Nehardea remained orphaned for although a scholar of the calibre of Mar Ukba was Exilarch and the people were compelled to obey him, he never commanded the same respect as Shmuel did. Nor was Mar Ukba the only one who participated in the leadership of Babylonian Jewry. Raba bar Avuha, another representative of Jewry also lived and was active at that time.<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">The name Raba is an abbreviation of Rab Aba.</i>
In his “Chronicle”, Rav Sherira Gaon lays claim to being a descendant of the Exilarch Raba bar Avuha. Some historians doubt this statement for if we assume that Mar Ukba was Exilarch, it would have been impossible for Raba bar Avuha to hold this office at the same time. Nevertheless such a situation is not altogether precluded. The office of Exilarch was of a political nature and its holder had to collect the taxes and to settle internal disputes. The government of Babylonia could easily have assigned to Mar Ukba and to Raba bar Avuha at different times.
Raba bar Avuha was a pupil of Rav (Aba Arecha) in whose name he quoted numerous statements. We may also assume that after the death of Rav many of his pupils went to Nehardea to continue their studies in the academy of Shmuel. But their devotion to the teachings of Rav was so great that even though they paid the highest respect to Shmuel, they did not quote any of his statements.
This was also true of Raba bar Avuha who later occupied a prominent position among the Jews of Babylonia and who probably conducted an academy of his own, even if we assume that he did not occupy the office of Exilarch. Aside from Rav Nachman bar Jacob, who quoted Raba about one hundred times, none of the other “Amoraim” ever mentioned his name. This situation may be explained by the fact that Rav Nachman was a son-in-law of Raba bar Avuha. But Raba bar Avuha was a friend of Rav Huna and Rav Jehudah with whom he studied at the academy of Rav.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קל״ד ב׳.</span></i> When Rav Nachman and Rav Huna visited Raba bar Avuha during his sickness they utilized the opportunity to ask him concerning certain decisions of Rav.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ע״ב א׳, בבא בתרא קל״ו א׳.</span></i>
Rav Nachman’s father was one of the judges in the court of Shmuel Yarchinaa. He frequently brought him to attend the trials and he later sent him to the school of Raba bar Avuha, who liked him so much that he gave him his daughter in marriage. The young man was beardless and some doubts were entertained as to his manhood. Raba bar Avuha then asked some scholars of Nehardea to investigate the matter.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות פ׳ ב׳.</span></i> The scholars reported favorably and soon after that Raba bar Avuha gave his gifted daughter Yalta in marriage to Rav Nachman. The Talmud contains many stories about Yalta from which it appears that she wished to be treated as an equal and rebelled against the treatment then accorded to women. Thus it is told that Ula, a pupil of Rabbi Jochanan, once visited Rav Nachman and was invited to dinner. After the meal was eaten and grace pronounced, Ula handed the “beaker of blessing” to Rav Nachman, but the latter said: “Let us send it to my wife Yalta.” Ula refused to do so and quoted a statement of Rabbi Jochanan who held women in contempt. Yalta heard this remark and in her anger she wrecked four hundred barrels of wine. (!) “Let us send her another beaker”, Rav Nachman then said to Ula, but Ula replied: “Any wine that is contained in a barrel is like the wine of the beaker of blessing. If she wishes she may drink of it.” To this Yalta retorted: “From such wanderers one can hear only empty words and torn rags only harbor filth.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות נ״א ב׳.</span></i>
Another story is related concerning Rav Amram the pious who suffered much from the servants of the Exilarch. The latter were annoyed by his extreme piety. Weary of their tormenting, he left the palace of the Exilarch and spent the night on the snow. On the following day the servants asked him what he would like to eat and he asked for lean meat and wine mixed with water. The servants then brought him fat meat and undiluted wine. Rav Amram became sick as a result of eating this food and his body was covered by a rash. When Yalta heard of this she took the man under her care and he allowed her to cure him.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ס״ז ב׳.</span></i>
On another occasion, when Rav Jehudah — a pupil of Rav and Shmuel — quoted Shmuel to the effect that one may not send greetings to a woman even through her husband, Yalta said to her husband: “Send away this person that you may not be confused with other Ame Aratzim.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ע׳ ב׳.</span></i>
In addition it was said that she questioned her husband concerning the accepted rule that everything which the Torah forbade had a counterpart that was permissible.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין ק״ט ב׳.</span></i>
It is said that Raba bar Avuha met the prophet Elijah twice. The description of one of these meetings has a purely allegoriacl significance. Elijah took him to paradise and told him to remove his mantle. Raba did so and squeezing the garment he sold the extracted odor for twelve thousand ducats; half of this sum he gave to his sons-in-law.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא קי״ד ב׳.</span></i>
Shortly after Shmuel’s death there broke out a great war in the vicinity of Nehardea. A leader of a Roman robber band named Papa ben Netzer — referred to as Odenatus by Roman historians — attacked the city of Nehardea and destroyed it. The academy was then closed for some time and Raba bar Avuha together with his son in law were forced to leave the city. They wandered from city to city until they finally settled in Mechoza on the banks of the Tigris. In that city Raba bar Avuha organized a court and continued to guide the life of the Jews of Babylonia.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת נ״ט ב׳, ערובין כ״ו א׳, יבמות קט״ו ב׳.</span></i>
Two of Shmuel’s daughters were taken captive during the war on Nehardea and were led to Palestine. Despite Shmuel’s rule that a woman who had been held captive should not be trusted when she declares that she had not been defiled, the scholars of Palestine did believe his daughters when they declared that they were pure.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות כ״ג ב׳.</span></i>
A third daughtr of Shmuel was also taken captive and married by a non-Jew. She tried to convert her husband and the son which she bore him is mentioned in the Talmud as Rav Mari bar Isur Giora or Rav Mari bar Rachel bath Shmuel.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות מ״ח ב׳.</span></i> Later there occurred the question of the inheritance of this Giora for he was conceived before his father was converted.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא קמ״ט א׳.</span></i>
The above mentioned Odenatus succeeded in vanquishing the Persians in the district of Nehardea and he also interfered with their development. He thus rose from the status of a robber chieftain, which was punishable by death, and he became an important support of Roman rule in Asia Minor. The Roman government later recognized him as an independent ruler of Palmyra, a city that was built one thousand years earlier by king Solomon. With his power augmented, Odenatus declared a war against the Persian empire under the rule of king Sapor and he forced its king to abandon his capital Ktensiphon.
For six years Odenatus maintained himself in power and emperor Galianus had to recognize him as an equal in the rule of Rome. (264 C. E.) Then he was assassinated by one of his retainers and many believed that his wife Zenovia had a hand in the plot.
Christian historians relate concerning queen Zenovia that she was favorably inclined toward the Jewish faith. It was also said that in opposition to her husband’s policy of aiding Rome she sought to liberate the Asiatic possessions of Rome. But the Jews of Palestine did not support queen Zenovia and when emperor Aurelianus waged war against her, he was supported by the Jews.

Rav Nachman bar Jacob

T<small>HIS</small> R<small>AV</small> N<small>ACHMAN</small> is often mentioned without the name of his father and he was one of the younger “Amoraim” of Babylonia. He was close to ninety years old when he died, and his period of influence extended between the year 235 and 325 C. E. His life occurred during an age of freedom. The Jews of Babylonia, living under conditions of comparative political security, were characterized by a certain self-confidence and gaiety.
As we have said, the city of Nehardea was attacked during the time of Raba bar Avuha and the academy there was forced into exile. This seems to have lasted only a few years, however, and it had no influence upon the situation of the Jews in general. Raba bar Avuha remained in Mechoza and may have died there. But his son-in-law, Rav Nachman, returned to Nehardea and guided his own academy which continued the work of Shmuel Yarchinaa and Raba bar Avuha.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא קנ״ג א׳.</span></i>
As son-in-law of the “Exilarch” Rav Nachman had very lordly manners, and the reproach which Mar Ukba once directed against another “Exilarch” that he did wrong because he went to sleep and awoke to the sound of music<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי מגלה פרק ג׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i> could have been applied to Rav Nachman in a much more severe form, although he was only a son-in-law of the “Exilarch” and yet he lived in a style which was unparalleled among Jews at that time. Servants armed with staffs and whips always encircled him when he appeared in the street, or when he sat in court, ready to beat anybody who did not pay him the proper respect or refused to accept his decisions.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ל״ג א׳.</span></i> His father-in-law had appointed him to the position of “Chief Justice” in Nehardea, and he felt himself superior to all his colleagues because of his position and he used to tell them that they had no right to criticize his decisions because he was the judge and not they.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות צ״ד ב׳.</span></i>
He never allowed for circumstances in making his decisions. A typical story tells of an old woman who came to him to complain about the servants of the “Exilarch” because they robbed her of a few planks in order to build a religious Tabernacle (<span dir="rtl">סוכה</span>) for the “Exilarch”. She screamed that the “Exilarch” and all his guests were feasting in a stolen “tabernacle”.
During the woman’s testimony Rav Nachman paid no attention to her and he did not even heed her cries. This made the woman angry and she said, “Why don’t you listen to my outcry? Are you proud of your army of servants? Who do you think I am? I am a daughter of Father Abraham and in my father’s house there were three hundred and eighteen servants, though nobody pays any attention to my cries here!” Rav Nachman answered, “She is a noisy woman and all she gets is the money for her wood.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוכה ל״א א׳.</span></i>
In his pride of office, Rav Nachman once asked Rav Huna, “Is the law as you say or as I think?” Rav Huna answered, “The law is certainly as you think, for you are close to the house of the Exilarch where the judges sit.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא ס״ה א׳.</span></i>
Until Rav Nachman’s time it was an accepted rule that civil suits were heard by three judges. Only occasionally were such cases allowed to be heard by a single judge; Rav Nachman did this constantly, thus breaking with a longstanding rule.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">[סנהדרין ה׳ א׳].</span></i> On another occasion when the case of a note of indebtedness was being judged, Rav Judah bar Ezekiel having torn up the note because he held it to be invalid, Rav Nachman said that only a “child” would have torn up that note, and added that “they were all children compared to me.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא ס״ו א׳.</span></i>
Rav Nachman was also ruthless in his treatment of his slaves. Whenever Shmuel Yarchinaa examined a female slave for medical purposes, it was his custom to pay the slave four gold coins to compensate for any shame which he was forced to cause her. When someone asked him why he did this, he answered, “The Bible says, to be sure, that a slave must work forever, which we must understand as meaning that a slave is our property for work but not to humiliate.” Rav Nachman, on the other hand, had no regard for the shame of his female slaves. Shmuel Yarchinaa, too, used to marry his female slaves to his male slaves, according to their own choice. Rav Nachman would mix them up at will, and when he chose he would take a woman from one of his slaves and give her to another, without regard to their moral sensibilities.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדה מ״ז א׳.</span></i>
Rav Nachman also made an innovation in trial procedure. It had been the custom until then that when one party claimed a debt and wished to be repaid by a second party who entirely denied the debt, the second party did not have to pay and did not even have to take an oath, for they believed that when a person owed someone money, he would never have the nerve to deny it outright. In Rav Nachman’s time, however, there was an increase in the number of daring swindlers who denied their debts and could not be forced to back up their denials with an oath. Rav Nachman ordained a so called <span dir="rtl">״שבועת היסת״</span> which was an oath administered in cases where the claimant had no witnesses to substantiate his claim of debt and the accused denied the debt completely. Rav Nachman thought that a debtor would ordinarily deny his debt if he knew that he would not be forced to swear but nobody would claim a debt where it did not exist.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא ה׳ א׳, שבועות מ׳ ב׳.</span></i>
There is a great deal of comment concerning Rav Nachman’s wealth. His wife, Yalta, once flew into a rage because a certain scholar did not wish to send her the “cup of blessing”, and she broke 400 barrels of wine. It is related, also, that Rav Nachman would drive out in a golden wagon, covered with a robe of purple dyed wool and led by slaves.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ל״א ב׳.</span></i>
It is related that once one of the Palestinian scholars named R. Isaac came to visit Rav Nachman. Rav Nachman welcomed him very cordially and after the guest had eaten and drunk his fill, Rav Nachman asked for his blessing. In answer R. Isaac told him the following story:
Once a traveller had lost his way in a desert and was wandering about tired, starved and thirsty. He came upon a tree unexpectedly, with sweet fruit, pleasant shade and watered by a stream which flowed under it. The wanderer ate the tree’s fruit, sat in its shade and drank from the spring.
When he was ready to go on the wanderer turned to the tree and said, “With what shall I bless thee, o thou excellent tree? Shall I say may your fruit be sweet? It is sweet already. Shall I say may your shade be pleasant? It is pleasant already. Shall I ask for a stream to flow beneath you? There is such a stream already. Then I will merely wish that all the plants that are cut from you may grow up to be like you.”
“It is the same with you,” R. Isaac added, “How shall I bless you? Shall I bless you with learning? You have learning enough already. Shall I bless you with riches? You have riches already. Shall I bless you with children? You have children already. Then I will merely wish that all of your descendants may be like you.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית ה׳ ב׳, ו׳ א׳.</span></i>
Rav Nachman’s scholarly activity dealt mainly with the regulation of practical life and money matters. His decisions in these fields were considered binding by later Babylonian judges. As they said, “In any money matter, the law is as Rav Nachman said.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות י״ג א׳, קדושין נ״ט ב׳, בבא מציעא י׳ א׳.</span></i> In his decisions Rav Nachman was not bothered by the fact that very often the literal law of the Mishnah was opposed to his stand. Following the precedent of Shmuel Yarchinaa who held that the law of the Gentiles was valid, he adopted certain Persian regulations as part of Jewish law. It should be remarked also that in spite of his strict principles he often tried to moderate the severity of religious custom: for instance, he said that bricks or other building materials which had been left after a building was completed might be removed on the Sabbath because they were in the same category as vessels and utensils, no longer being considered as building materials.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ביצה ל״א ב׳.</span></i>
Concerning “Claims through possession” Rav Nachman said that the household of the “Exilarch” could lay no claim to the property of others on the basis of possession and <i>vice versa</i>: if a member of the Exilarch’s household occupied the fields of another person, this did not constitute a claim of possession, just as it was not a valid claim of possession if anyone held some of the Exilarch’s property, because the Exilarch’s household could not be denied anything and they were allowed to do anything they chose. Similarly there could be not talk of claims of possession against the Exilarch’s property, because his servants used to let strangers live in their houses and cultivate their fields and said nothing, because they did not care if other people took care of the Exilarch’s houses or fertilized his fields, since they knew that they could take everything back by force whenever they wanted to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא ל״ו א׳.</span></i>
Once there was talk of the Messiah in Rav Nachman’s presence, and various opinions were expressed as to who the Messiah was. Rav Nachman said that “if the Messiah was alive it might be that it was he himself.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין צ״ח א׳.</span></i> On another occasion one of the scholars studying with Rav Nachman quoted the “Boraitha” which said that since the death of R. Judah Hanasi humility and piety had vanished. Said Rav Nachman in answer: “As long as I am alive you need not say that piety has disappeared.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה מ״ט ב׳.</span></i>
Once Rav Nachman dared to order Rav Judah bar Ezekiel, the head of the academy in Pumbeditha, to appear on trial before him in Nehardea. The story was as follows: a certain Nehardean came to Pumbeditha to buy meat at a butcher’s. He came at the same time as one of Rav Judah bar Ezekiel’s servants. The butcher said to the fellow, “Wait a while until I give Rav Judah bar Ezekiel’s servant his meat.” The man made a grimace of distaste and said, “Who is this Rav Judah bar Shveskal, that I should wait for him.” The story was related to Rav Judah who was considerably annoyed, and having heard similar tales about the same fellow, he had him excommunicated. The man complained about Rav Judah to Rav Nachman. Without hesitation Rav Nachman sent a “summons” to Rav Judah to appear and explain his action. Rav Judah would not have paid any attention to Rav Nachman’s summons, if he had not gone to Rav Huna first and asked him what to do. Rav Huna told him that by right he should not go because his learning was greater than that of Rav Nachman. However, since he was the son-in-law of the Exilarch, Rav Nachman should be paid the respect of having Rav Judah appear before him.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ע׳ א׳.</span></i>
The scholars of Babylon were generally angry at Rav Nachman because he presumed too much upon the authority of his father-in-law, the Exilarch, and even expressed himself about earlier scholars in a manner which was considered sinful. For example he once swore in a discussion of a law of R. Jochanan’s that he would not accept it if he heard it from R. Jochanan himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין קכ״ד א׳.</span></i>
As we said above, Rav Nachman’s wife was a woman of peculiar character and she also wore the pants in the house, so to speak. This may have been the reason why when Rav Nachman came to the city of Shchenziv he ordered his servants to find him a woman who would be willing to be his wife during his stay in the city and agree to a divorce thereafter.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא י״ח ב׳, יבמות ל״ז ב׳.</span></i>
There is also a frightful story about Rav Nachman’s daughters who were captured by pagans. At first they used to stir the boiling pots on the oven with their bare hands so that whoever saw it would think that because of their great virtue they did not feel their hands burning. Later, however, Rav Ilish was captive together with them and wanted to ransom them because they were Rav Nachman’s daughters. But he once heard them in conversation and they said: “What do we lack here? In Nehardea we had man and here we have them, too. Let us have them take us far away from here so that our husbands cannot come and ransom us from captivity.”<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין מ״ה א׳.</span></i>
It is interesting that when Raba sat by Rav Nachman’s bed as he was dying, Rav Nachman promised him that he would appear to him from the next world. When Rav Nachman did appear to Raba, he asked him if he had felt any pain at death. Rav Nachman said that the departure of his soul was like drawing a hair out of milk. If the Almighty wanted to send him back now to whence he had come, he would not accept because he would be afraid to suffer once more the pains of life and the fear of the Angel of Death.

Rav Huna, Head of the Academy in Sura

A<small>T THE TIME WITH WHICH</small> we are concerned the Jews of Palestine were suffering terribly from material need and political oppression. Large sections of the country lay waste and uninhabited. As a result any Jew who could possibly leave the country did so, and anyone who was able to go to Babylonia was considered lucky. The whole neighborhood of Jerusalem was inhabited by Gentiles and in Babylonia, on the other hand, a new sort of Jewish life began to flourish. Since the community was based from the beginning upon the functions of prayer and study, the Torah was held in high honor and the scholars were the real leaders.
One of these scholars was Rav Huna of Diakora, called “Diokra” and “Diokereth” in the Talmud, who must not be confused with Rav Hunah Rabah, the “Exilarch” of Babylonia, who lived at the time of Rabbi Judah Hanasi. This should be carefully noted, since the existence of several Rav Hunas has led some comentators to interchange the two men. Our Rav Huna of Diakora was born about 216 C. E. He spent most of his life in the academy at Sura where he arrived in his early youth as a student of Rav (Abba Arecha) and remained until the end of his days.
Like Rav Chisda, Rav Huna was called the pious Babylonian”<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית כ״ג ב׳.</span></i> and it was said that he was worthy to have had the Holy Spirit rest upon him. But this did not happen because he lived in Babylonia.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ה א׳.</span></i> Most of Rav’s enactments have reached us through Rav Huna’s hands. In addition many of the sayings of Rav Huna are obviously quoted from Rav although this is not declared expressly. One should know also that Rav often spoke to Rav Huna in a contemptuous tone.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין ט״ז א׳, חולין צ״ה א׳.</span></i>
Right after Rav’s death Rav Huna became the head of the academy in Sura. During the life of Shmuel Yarchinaa, however, Babylonian Jews considered the academy in Nehardea as the more important. For a certain time Rav Hamnuna was considered the spiritual heir of Rav. In addition many of the scholars of Sura left in order to continue their studies elsewhere, in the new academies which were beginning to develop. Only after the death of Shmuel Yarchinaa and when the academy in Nehardea began to lose its former significance, and especially after the destruction of Nehardea, did Rav Huna receive the title of “Head of the Academy” in Sura.
Rav Huna’s parents are not known. Since we know however from the “Chronicle” of Rav Shrira Gaon that he was descended from the family of the Exilarch, many historians state that he was a grandson of Rav Huna Rabah, who was Exilarch in the time of Rabbi Judah Hanasi. He himself does not mention his ancestors anywhere.
It is interesting to note the mention of Rav Huna’s wealth. At first stories are told of his poverty and suddenly he seems to have become a wealthy man. When he was still poor, it is related, he used to labor in his own field, and when people came to him for judgment he would say: “Get someone to do my work for me while I listen to your arguments and I will undertake the judgment.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ק״ה א׳.</span></i> On another occasion it is said, Rav Huna was letting his cattle graze in the pasture, when someone approached him and asked him to give testimony for him in a certain matter, about which he seems to have been well informed. Rav Huna said to him: “If you will pay me what I will lose by leaving my work, I will bear witness for you.” Similarly when two persons came before him for trial while he was up in a date palm picking the fruit, he replied; “If you will come up here and take my place, I will take on your case.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי סנהדרין פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>
It was from this time also that he derived his knowledge of trees of which he used to avail himself later in deciding cases.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ג״ד ב׳.</span></i> Other stories relate that when he once needed money for wine for the Sabbath, he pawned his girdle and belted himself with a rope. When Rav saw him enter school in this fashion he asked him what this meant. Rav Huna told him the whole story and Rav blessed him that another time he might be girded in silk.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה כ״ז א׳.</span></i>
Then suddenly we hear that Rav Huna owned many fields and vineyards which he no longer cultivated himself, but hired out to tenants, and his flocks of sheep were pastured in the broad plains of southern Babylonia.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ה׳ א׳, בבא קמא פ׳ ב׳.</span></i> At this time his family, too, had grown great in sons, daughters, in-laws and grandchilden, and when Rav Huna married off his son Rabah, he sat on a divan in a side room and, being short of stature, he remained unnoticed. Then his daughters and daughters-in-law cast their silken robes upon him and covered him up completely. When he was later uncovered, people were reminded of the time of his poverty when he belted himself with a rope and came so into the school, and Rav blessed him that he might some day be wrapped in silk.
A story is told of the accomplishments of Rav Huna and of his wealth, that whenever there was a storm, of the sort which often uprooted trees and overturned houses in Sura, Rav Huna would take a walk through the streets of Sura after it was quiet, and when he saw a shattered wall which had been damaged by the storm and was about to cave in, he would order his slaves to tear down the wall so that it might not injure passers-by, and then had a new one constructed at his own expense if he knew that the owner could not afford to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה כ״ז א׳ וב׳.</span></i>
When Rav Huna sat down to eat, he opened the doors of his house wide and invited anyone who was hungry to eat with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית כ׳ ב׳.</span></i> It is related that in the months of Adar and Elul when the students of the academy would gather, he would feed eight hundred students at his own expense.
In those two months Rav Huna was surrounded by thirteen scholars who acted as interpreters and whatever they heard him say was repeated to the students in a simplified form. In this connection we are given an idea of the number of students who sat at the feet of Rav Huna in his academy. “When they stood up and shook the dust from their clothes, they would becloud the sun in Palestine.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ק״ו א׳.</span></i>
He said, “whoever devotes himself entirely to study, and does not act generously towards his fellows, is like a man without a God.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה י״ז ב׳.</span></i> Nevertheless the scholars were never timid about it when Rav Huna needed upbraiding. Thus one time he had four hundred barrels of wine turn sour and suffered a great loss in money. The scholars came to console him and said; “Now is the time when you should consider your past actions, for it is inconceivable that the Almighty should punish somebody unless he deserved it. You have probably treated your tenant unjustly and have not given him his proper share of the grapes.” Rav Huna listened to their words and began to better his ways.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ה׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Rav Huna is supposed to have been “Head of the Academy” in Sura for forty years. Under his guidance the Jews in Babylonia slowly began to liberate themselves from their dependence in religious matters upon the Palestinian scholars. Rav Huna was the first to cut off relations with Palestine in many cases. He said: “We have made ourselves like unto Palestine.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ו׳ א׳, בבא קמא פ׳ א׳.</span></i> In fact the learning of Babylon surpassed that of Palestine at that time and it was only devotion to the old home of the Jewish faith that made the Jews continue to send their inquiries to Palestine for decisioin of such cases as the Babylonian scholars did not wish to decide on their own responsibility. It was an accepted rule among Babylonian scholars that “one of them (Palestinian scholars) is as good as two of us, and one of ours who goes there is as good as two of theirs.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ע״ה א׳.</span></i> So long as Rabbi Jochanan (the compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud) was alive in Palestine, Rav Huna’s prestige was great only in Babylonia, but when Rabbi Jochanan died, Rav Huna’s importance was recognized even in Palestine, where he was called “the head of all the chiefs.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי חגיגה פרק א׳ הלכה ח׳.</span></i> Even though he was not of priestly family he used to read the first chapter in the synagogue on Sabbath and holidays, and the Palestinian “Amoraim”, Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi, who were both high-born priests permitted him to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה כ״ב א׳, גטין נ״ט ב׳.</span></i>
In examining Rav Huna’s sayings one finds traces of the spirit of Rav, and a similarity of concise style which said everything in one word. Only in a few places does Rav Huna show a tendency to oppose Rav. Nevertheless he himself proclaimed the rule that “the law in all religious matters is as Rav said, and in civil suits as Samuel said.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות מ״ט ב׳.</span></i> In other places we find Rav Huna yielding to a tendency to hair-splitting which led him to go away from the point at issue.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא מ״ז ב׳, חולין מ״ט ב׳, ערכין י״ד א׳.</span></i> It is characteristic of Rav Huna also that even when he disagreed with his friend and contemporary Rav Nachman bar Jacob in a matter of law concerning money he conceded that “the law is probably on Rav Nachman’s side because he is more familiar with these matters than I am.”<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא ס״ה א׳.</span></i>
Rav Huna’s statement is revealing as to the spirit of the times when he spoke concerning the problem of the books which were rescued from fire on the Sabbath. The Mishnah says that translations of Holy Scriptures which are not even read in the synagogue may be rescued on Sabbath and in any case should be hidden away and not left without care. Rav Huna, on the contrary, felt that “Holy Scriptures in Aramaic translation or in other languages should not be rescued from fire on the Sabbath.”<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קט״ו א׳.</span></i>
Certain moral teachings of Rav Huna’s should be mentioned, as for instance, what Rav Helbo said in his name: “Whoever sets aside a definite place for his prayer, is helped by the God of Father Abraham, for Abraham too had a definite place for his prayers.” And further, said Rav Helbo, when such a person dies, he is mourned in the following manner: “Alas, what a modest and pious man he was, one of the disciples of Father Abraham.” Again Rav Helbo said in the name of Rav Huna that in leaving the synagogue one should not walk with long paces. And if a person makes a custom of praying behind the synagogue such a man should be called an evil-doer. One should be very careful to say the vesper prayers for the prophet Elijah was aided by God in his battle against the prophets of Baal during the time of vespers. One should know also that the words of the God-fearing are heard in Heaven. On another occasion Rav Helbo said in the name of Rav Huna that “one who knows that his friend is accustomed to greet him should greet him first. If one person greets another and the latter does not respond to the greeting he is worthy of being called a bandit.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ו׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Like many other scholars of the time, Rav Huna regretted that the Jews were no longer able to offer sacrifices and whenever he would come to the passage “and Abraham called the name of the place God will see as is said today on the hill of God shall be seen” (Genesis, 22:14) in the course of his reading in the Bible, he would shed many tears and say “Oh how sad that a slave whose master wishes to see him should be forced to remain apart from his master!” It was the same way when he would reach the verse “and thou shalt offer up peace-offerings and thou shalt eat there” (Deuteronomy, 27:7) he would weep and say: “O that a slave whose master wishes to eat at his table should be forced to remain apart from his master!”<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה ד׳ ב׳.</span></i>
It is probable that Rav Huna lived over eighty years and he was never sick until the day of his death. His significance was so very great that his successors used to pray that the Almighty might give them the wisdom of Rav Huna.<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ח א׳.</span></i>

Rav Chisda the Priest

W<small>HEN</small> R<small>AV</small> H<small>UNA</small> was named “Head of the Academy” in Sura, Rav Chisda, who is called “Rav Chisdai” in the Jerusalem Talmud, was among the prominent pupils of Rav who lived there. It is said that he was a priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות מ״ד א׳, חולין מ״ד ב׳.</span></i> When he was still a child, astrologers predicted that he would be a scholar.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות כ״א ב׳.</span></i> For a long time this Rav Chisda conducted his own academy in Kafri, and after Rav Huna and Rav Judah bar Ezekiel died he took Rav’s place in the academy of Sura.
If we judge by the number of years that Rav (Aba Arecha) lived in Babylon, it seems likely that Rav Chisda was about 30 years old when Rav died. From this we may infer that he probably studied under Rav, although there is no mention of any personal encounter between Rav Chisda and Rav or Shmuel; for during Rav’s life Rav Chisda apparently sat modestly in a corner of his school and listened to his words with pious attention. Several times, however, he repeats certain laws in the name of Rav.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות מ״ג א׳, פּסחים ק״ז א׳</span>.</i> On one occasion in repeating a law of Rav’s he termed him “Rabbenu” (our Rabbi).<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ל״ח ב׳</span>.</i> Since he considered himself the greatest expert in the laws of Rav, he once said that he would give away two portions of his “perquisites of priesthood” to anyone who could tell him of some new saying of Rav’s.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת י׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Only after the death of Shmuel Yarchinaa, when Rav Huna became the “Head of the Academy” did Rav Chisda attain recognition as a student of Rav Huna’s. He was a man of forty at the time. In the meantime he had studied under a number of other pupils of Rav’s, and people were beginning to pay attention to his opinions. Still it is characteristic that in all the time that Rav Chisda sat under Rav Huna as a student he was very careful never to say anything that might appear to be a statement of a law.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין ס״ב ב׳.</span></i> And when someone once came to consult him on a question of law he immediately referred him to Rav Huna.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא ז׳ א׳.</span></i> Only one exception is recorded: when the “Exilarch” asked Rav Huna what was the basis of the law which forbade bride and groom to wear crowns on their heads at a wedding. Rav Huna answered: “This was an enactment of the Rabbis who relate that in the time of the war against Emperor Vespasian it was forbidden to wear bridegroom’s crowns and to celebrate engagement parties.” After this statement Rav Huna left the school. Then Rav Chisda said: “It is not only an enactment of the Rabbis, but there is also a Bible text for it: ‘Remove the mitre and take off the crown.’ (Ezekiel, 21, 31). It is natural to ask what is the relation between the mitre and the crown? The following exegesis solves this problem: the verse means that so long as the mitre remains on the head of the High Priest, others may wear the crown, but when the mitre was removed from the head of the High Priest, the crown upon the heads of others had to fall also!”
In the meantime Rav Huna had returned and hearing Rav Chisda’s interpretation he was not angry because Rav Chisda had allowed himself to express an opinion in opposition to his teacher, but he said: “I swear to God that the prohibition of which we spoke is an enactment of the Rabbis. But concerning the words of Chisda we can only say that just as his name is Chisda so are his words full of <span dir="rtl">״חסד״</span> (grace).<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ז׳ א׳.</span></i><sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">* This story is related in a different form in the Jerusalem Talmud. (<span dir="rtl">סוטה פרק ט׳ הלכה ט״ז</span>). There it seems that the Exilarch sent to Rav Chisda to inquire the meaning of the verse “Remove the mitre and take off the crown.” Rav Chisda interpreted the verse as above, and Rabbi Jochanan heard it and said; “His name is <i>Chisda</i> and his words are full of <i>chesed.”</i></i>
Rav Chisda and Rav Huna were usually called “the elders of Sura” by their contemporaries.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין י״ז ב׳.</span></i>
The work of both served to raise the prestige of the academy in Sura, besides which Rav Huna attained great fame in Palestine.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין נ״ט ב׳.</span></i> Both lived very long. Rav Chisda reached the age of 92 years, and it seems that he lived more than ten years after Rav Huna’s death.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״א א׳.</span></i>
Like Rav Huna who was a poor man and later became rich Rav Chisda, according to his own story, became rich after an earlier period of poverty. Once when the importance of eating vegetables was being discussed, Rav Chisda said: “I never ate any vegetables. When I was poor I did not eat them because they awaken appetite, and I had nothing with which to satisfy my appetite. When I became rich I didn’t eat them because I preferred to eat meat and fish.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבה ק״מ ב׳.</span></i> A story telling of Rav Chisda’s riches says that it came to him in a natural manner. His own statement was that having occupied himself with the manufacture of beer he found the secret of how to become rich.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים קי״ג ב׳.</span></i> In proof of the immensity of his wealth it is related that his deer ate nothing but the finest meal.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ח ב׳.</span></i> His students, however, seem to have been treated differently because he used to train them in frugality and he would say: “Anyone who can eat rye bread and eats a wheaten loaf, is guilty of a transgression against the commandment ‘Thou shalt not destroy.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ק״מ ב׳.</span></i> In spite of his wealth which permitted him to maintain a large following of servants, he personally supervised all the work on his fields and kept an eye on every bit of expense.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא צ״א ב׳.</span></i> It is interesting, too, that he would entrust the whole conduct of his household to his servants, but he always kept the key to the woodshed himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין נ״ז א׳.</span></i>
It is related that Rav Chisda was the pupil of the Babylonian Amora Avimi for a long time. This man had no title and we know of him only through Rav Chisda’s quotations of his enactments, as well as by Rav Chisda’s statement that he had often been beaten by Avimi and he had borne the blows patiently.<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מנחות ז׳ א׳.</span></i>
When Rav Chisda grew rich he felt a rebellion of his pride against Rav Huna, although he continued to be as modest as before in his ordinary life, and whenever he met anyone in the street, even a pagan, he met them with a friendly “Good morning.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ס״ב א׳.</span></i> But since he seems to have felt injured in some way by Rav Huna he was on the lookout for a chance to pay him out for the injury. He found his opportunity when the two of them had an argument about the respect which one is obliged to pay one’s teacher. Rav Chisda asked how the case stood with a student whose teacher needed him in order to sharpen his mind by answering his acute questions. Rav Huna understood that Rav Chisda meant himself by the reference and intended to cast a reflection upon Rav Huna. He replied; “Chisda, Chisda, know that I need you not at all, but you do need me.” Afterwards they parted from each other for forty long years. Rav Chisda left Sura and settled in Kafri where he established an academy of his own and taught students according to his own methods.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין ס״ב ב׳.</span></i> Later Rav Chisda fasted forty times in repentance for having caused his teacher pain, and Rav Huna also fasted 40 times for having wrongly suspected Rav Chisda of wishing to insult him.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא ל״ג א׳.</span></i>
Rav Chisda was very keen in the interpretation of law and he was also very clever in reading new meanings into things by skillful analogies. We shall cite two examples of his way of thinking: In explaining the reason why a man is allowed to go two thousand ells away from his place on the Sabbath even though the Bible says, “Let no man leave his place on the seventh day” (Exodus, 17, 29) Rav Chisda said that in as much as the expression “place” was also used in the verse “and I shall set up a place for you” (Exodus, 21, 13) in the case of an accidental homicide the two passages were parallel and the word “place” (<span dir="rtl">מקום</span>) should be understood to mean a city. Later the word “he will flee” is used concerning an accidental homicide, so that we must understand the word “place” used concerning the Sabbath to refer also to flight. The problem arises how far one may flee. There is another verse “the boundary of his city of refuge that he flees” (Numbers, 38, 26) so that we must interpret the verse “let no man leave his place” as if it used the word “boundary”. The meaning of the word boundary must be inferred from its meaning in its use in the verse which uses the expression outside “and their measures are two thousand ells outside the city” (Numbers, 35, 5). We find therefore that the measure of a “Sabbath pale” from which a man is allowed to flee is the boundary of “two thousand ells”.<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין נ״א א׳.</span></i>
Rav Chisda performed a similar feat of interpretation in connection with the law of “searching out leaven”. How do we know that leavened bread must be searched out before Passover with a candle? In dealing with the matter the Bible says “rye shall not be found for seven days” (Exodus, 12, 19) and since in the story of Joseph’s cup the Bible says “and he searched and he found” (Genesis, 44, 12) it is clear that in order to find one must search, and there is a Biblical verse concerning searching which states “I will search Jerusalem with candles” (Zephaniah, 1, 12) so that we know that in order to search to find, one must use candles. And if we wish to know how many candles to use there is a verse which states “The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord searching all the inward parts of the belly” (Proverbs, 20, 27). From this we may infer that if one searches in order to find, one should search with one candle.<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים ז׳ ב׳.</span></i>
After Rav Chisda left Rav Huna’s academy they had frequent differences of opinion over matters of law in which each one directly contradicted the other, as for instance in the question of how pure a place must be in order that <span dir="rtl">״קריאת שמע״</span> may be said there,<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות כ״ח א׳.</span></i> or whether one may make a hole in a barrel on the Sabbath in order to put in a tap,<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קמ״ז א׳.</span></i> or concerning the problem that all foods have to be salted and whether a dish kept overnight had to have spices.<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ביצה י״ד א׳.</span></i> On another occasion they differed concerning an important problem of life: a man had given his agent a divorce for his wife and the agent had faithfully carried out his mission and delivered the divorce. Later the man regretted his action and claimd that he had simply given the divorce papers to his messenger for safe-keeping. The messenger, on the other hand, claimed that he had received the papers for delivery to the wife. Rav Huna said the man was to be believed and the divorce did not stand. Rav Chsida, on the other hand, said that the agent was to be believed and the divorce was valid.<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ס״ד א׳.</span></i>
But even though Rav Huna was annoyed by Rav Chisda he told his son Rabah to go to Rav Chisda’s academy. At first Rabah did not want to do so, but his father told him to go because Rav Chisda was very keen in his legal arguments and he could learn a great deal from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת פ״ב א׳.</span></i> Later Rabah bar Rav Huna became a devoted friend of Rav Chisda’s. Since they used to study together they would often concur in their opinons, as the Talmud says, “Rav Chisda and Rabah bar Rav Huna who both say.”<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת פ״ט א׳, פּסחים י׳ ב׳, כתובות צ״ט ב׳.</span></i> Later they would often sit in judgment together.<sup class="footnote-marker">30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת י׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Rav Chisda was very much inclined to interpret various Biblical verses in order to derive new laws or to justify accepted laws. Thus, for instance, he said that anyone who prays for another person should not mention the name of the person for whom he is praying, just as Moses prayed for his sister Miriam and said no more than “please Lord heal her please” because the Almighty knows without being told for whom the prayer is meant.<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ל״ד א׳.</span></i>
Since the Sabbath was the most important element in the Jewish religion at that time and everybody considered it a merit to aid in the preparation of the Sabbath, Rav Chisda said that a person should rise very early on Friday morning in order to be able to have everything ready for Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">32)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ז ב׳.</span></i>
It is certain that Rav Chisda spent some time in Palestine. It is not known however when this occurred. Some say that Rav Chisda went to Palestine for Rav Huna’s burial. But this is hard to believe since Rav Chisda was a man of eighty at the time of Rav Huna’s death and the trip from Babylon to Palestine would have been to difficult for a man of that age.
Rav Chisda’s friends were Rav Nachman bar Jacob, Rav Sheshet, and, as we said above, Rabah bar Rav Huna. It is said that when Rav Chisda once met Rav Sheshet his lips trembled with fear lest Rav Sheshet ask him some difficult questions. At the same time Rav Sheshet was trembling throughout his whole body for fear lest Rav Chisda start on one of his involved disputations.
Rav Chisda was accustomed to stay up all night and study. It is said that once one of his daughters suggested that he get a little sleep. Rav Chisda answered that soon enough the long days of the grave would come and then he would have plenty of time for a long sleep.<sup class="footnote-marker">33)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין ס״ה א׳.</span></i>
Rav Chisda had six learned and prominent sons. Nevertheless he once said that daughters were preferable to sons.<sup class="footnote-marker">34)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא קי״א א׳.</span></i> In his anxiety for the welfare of his daughters he once urged them to be restrained in their intimate relations with their husbands.<sup class="footnote-marker">35)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ק״מ ב׳.</span></i> Since he lived such a long time Rav Chisda had the good fortune to attend sixty weddings of his children and his grandchildren.<sup class="footnote-marker">36)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ח א׳.</span></i>
The Talmud relates that when the time of his death drew near the Angel of Death could not approach him because he did not interrupt his study for an instant. Therefore the Angel of Death seated himself upon a cedar in the garden of the Temple, and when the tree broke, Rav Chisda was silenced for a moment and died instantly.

Rav Judah bar Ezekiel

P<small>ARTICULARLY PROMINENT</small> both in his views and in personal traits was Rav Judah bar Ezekiel who is usually mentioned in the Talmud without his patronymic as Rav Judah. It appears from his sayings which have survived that he was very sharp-tongued in his dealings with people and when somebody dared to say something that did not please him, he practically murdered that person with his speech.
While Rav (Aba Arecha) was alive, Rav Judah bar Ezekiel was one of his outstanding students with whose opinions Rav was forced to reckon. Whenever Rav had to make a trip in the interests of the community he took Rav Judah along with him in order to have someone to talk to on the road.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין פ״א א׳, עבודה זרה ע״א א׳.</span></i> And when Rav sent away his son Chiya to study, he chose Rav Judah as his teacher.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין ב׳ ב׳, י״א א׳.</span></i>
Rav Judah bar Ezekiel was born in 219 C. E. on the very same day when Rabbi Judah Hanasi died in Palestine<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ע״ב ב׳.</span></i> and died around 299 C. E. His father Rav Ezekiel was also a scholar. It is said that Samuel Yarchinai used to treat him respectfully and would rise when he met him.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ל״ג ב׳.</span></i> Rav Judah received his first instruction from his father.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ט׳ הלכה ב׳, תענית פרק א׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i> Later he made such progress through his own diligence that when his father was teaching his brother Rami, he permitted himself to tell his father that he was teaching him incorrectly.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ל״ב א׳.</span></i>
When Samuel Yarchinai died the great academy of Nehardea was transferred to Sura under Rav Huna. At that time Rav Judah was about sixty years of age and he founded the academy in Pumbeditha. Even though Rav Judah was the head of that great academy, he was under the influence of Rav Huna in Sura for a long time. As we said Rav Judah was a student of Rav’s and when Rav died he studied a short time with Rav Asi in Huzel. Later he studied with Samuel Yarchinai in Nehardea. It occurred frequently, however, that when Rav Judah would quote some statement of Samuel’s, other scholars would deny that Samuel ever said it. Even Rav Judah’s own brother, Rami bar Ezekiel, once said, “Pay no attention to what my brother says in the name of Samuel.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות כ״א א׳, חולין מ״ד א׳.</span></i> On other occassions when Rav Judah said something in his own name, other scholars said: “What Rav Judah is now saying in his own name is a quotation from Samuel!”<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין ז׳ א׳, יבמות י״ח א׳, כתובות י״ב א׳.</span></i>
Being extremely sharp-witted and more brainy than emotional, Rav Judah felt that study was the essential thing and prayer merely of incidental significance; and since he never wished to stop studying it is said of him that he prayed only once in thirty days.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה ל״ח א׳.</span></i> Nevertheless he once said on the same subject that he considered it one of his merits that he observed the commandment of contemplating the prayer.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ח ב׳.</span></i> This saying of his was later interpreted in the sense that when he said his prayers once in thirty days, he would cleanse his soul first and only then would he pray.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ל׳ א׳.</span></i>
His mind was of a logical bent and therefore he devoted himself mainly to problems of fiscal law, where he had a broad field for the exercise of his reasoning powers. It was related also that when he came across the laws of ritual purity in the course of his study, or other matters which had no legal significance in his own time, he would say: “Such matters were of interest to Rav and Samuel.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות כ׳ א׳, תענית כ״ד א׳, סנהדרין ק״ו ב׳.</span></i>
Because of his keenness Samuel called him <span dir="rtl">״שיננא״</span> which means sharp-witted.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ל״ו א׳, ראש השנה כ״ד ב׳.</span></i><sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">The expression <span dir="rtl">״שיננא״</span> is found always on occasions where Rav Judah differed from his teacher, Samuel Yarchinai. From the context of the speeches it would seem that the words were used in a complimentary sense. It may be however that this title was used ironically.</i> At another time Samuel said of him that he was not born of woman because he was simply an angel.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדה י״ג א׳.</span></i>
Being descended from very aristocratic stock which traced its descent straight to the prophets, he was very scrupulous in matters of racial purity, and this often involved him in very bitter disputes. He felt that the whole significance of the return of the Exiles in the time of Ezra the Scribe consisted in the fact that Ezra removed all the mixed families to Palestine and left all the pure families in Babylon.
As we have already noted the scholars of Babylon exerted themselves to free the life of the Babylonian Jews from the wardenship of Palestine. However there were always many scholars in the Babylonian academies who felt impelled to go to Palestine. This displeased Rav Judah and he said that “anyone who lives in Babylon is as though he lived in Palestine.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות קי״א א׳.</span></i> And if a Babylonian still wanted to go to Palestine it was no less than a sin as the Almighty warned us through the prophet Jeremiah, “To Babylon they shall come and there they shall be.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות כ״ב ב׳, שבת מ״א א׳.</span></i> For many scholars however their love for Palestine was a stronger force than their teacher’s opposition and they said nothing to him about leaving the country because they knew he would not permit them to leave. One of these students was Rav Aba, a native of Babylon, who studied with Rav Judah and left his teacher without asking his permission.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות כ״ד ב׳.</span></i> Rabbi Zeira did the same. Even Rav Judah’s own brother, Rami, did not regard his brother’s opinion and left Babylon to settle in Palestine.<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות קי״א ב׳.</span></i>
As we said the purity of the family was the most important element in the whole national existence of the Jewish people, according to Rav Judah. And since he was always examining into the purity of various families he found it difficult to get a suitable wife for his son Isaac, who had long been of marriageable age, until Ula, on one of his numberless trips between Babylon and Palestine, arrived in Pumbeditha and heard of Rav Judah’s habit of inquiring into the history of various families. Said he: “How do we know what our own origin is? Perhaps we too are descendants of those pagans which slipped into the fold during the time when the Temple was destroyed?” Because of Rav Judah’s agitation about the problem of purity of families, a number of betrothals were broken off in Jewish homes and there were even a number of divorces. The people grew angry at Rav Judah and a mob once got together in order to stone him. He was not the least bit frightened by the mob and he said: “If they annoyed him, he would reveal that they all came from impure families.” The crowd was frightened and they all threw away their stones and did not trouble Rav Judah any longer.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ע׳ א׳ וב׳.</span></i>
Through his desire to reveal the impure families, Rav Judah once came into conflict with a certain political boss, Bati bar Tobia. This person was a freedman who had managed to win the esteem of king Sapor. In consequence the whole world toadied to him and tried to find favor in his eyes. Only Rav Judah had the courage to say that since the freedman in his pride had not asked his former owner for a certificate of liberation, he was still legally a slave and no free man could marry his children.
As we have already related, a certain person from Nehardea once came to Pumbeditha and went to a butcher to buy meat, just at the time when one of Rav Judah bar Ezekiel’s servants came there. The butcher said to him: “You will have to wait awhile until I give meat to Rav Judah bar Ezekiel’s servant.” The man made a grimace and asked: “Who is this Rav Judah bar Sheveskal, that I must wait for him?” The story was repeated to Rav Judah and he was highly annoyed. And since he was told in addition that the man boasted of an ancestry which reached back to the Hasmoneans and was accustomed to call everyone “slave”, Rav Judah excommunicated him according to Samuel Yarchinai’s long-established rule that “anyone who boasts of his descent from the Hasmoneans is certainly a slave,” because king Herod killed off all the Hasmoneans without exception. The condemned man complained to Rav Nachman bar Jacob about Rav Judah. Rav Nachman did not hesitate a moment but sent Rav Judah a summons to appear before him and explain his actions. Rav Judah would not have heeded Rav Nachman’s summons and would not have appeared for trial. But he went to Rav Huna first to ask his advice. Rav Huna said that by right he should not have to go, because his learning was greater than that of Rav Nachman. But seeing that the latter was the son-in-law of the Exilarch, he should do him the honor of obeying his summons.
When Rav Judah arrived at Rav Nachman bar Jacob’s house he found him making a balcony for his roof, and Rav Judah said: “How comes it that you are doing work unsuited to your social status, which ought to be done by someone else?” And no matter what Rav Nachman had to answer him in the argument which followed, Rav Judah would correct the grammar of each sentence or prove to him that he was wrong as to the law. Yalta, Rav Nachman’s wife, heard the argument and said to her husband: “Send the man away or you will get a reputation as an ignoramus.”<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ע׳ א׳.</span></i>
After the destruction of Nehardea, the city of Pumbeditha became a center of the spiritual life of the Jews in Babylonia and when people spoke of the Jews in the Diaspora of that time, they meant Pumbeditha.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה כ״ג ב׳.</span></i> Later the city of Pumbeditha became a holy city for the Babylonian Jews. People would say that whoever leaves Pumbeditha in order to go somewhere else is as if he left Palestine to live in the Diaspora.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות קי״א א׳.</span></i>
Old documents tell us that Pumbeditha was a very clean city with many sanitary devices and the houses were like palaces. For a long time also there was a sort of competition between the academy in Sura, which was called <span dir="rtl">״מתא מחסיא״</span> and the academy in Pumbeditha. One of the scholars enjoined his children that they should rather live “in the dirt of Mata Mechasia than in the palaces of Pumbeditha.”<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">הוריות י״ב א׳.</span></i>
Whenever the academy of Pumbeditha was mentioned, interesting stories were told of the manner of study there and people would say that true wit flourished where Rav Judah had his seat. A story was told of one of Rav Judah’s students, Rami bar Dikola, who once arrived in Pumbeditha from Sura on the eve of Yom Kippur and saw them discarding the udders of their cows: for in Sura they did not eat the flesh of the udders, fearing that a lick of milk might still have remained there, while in Pumbeditha they did eat it after having slit it in two directions. This Rami bar Dikola gathered the discarded udders and ate them. He was brought before Rav Chisda to explain his actions. Rav Chisda asked him what had brought him to eat the udders of cows, knowing as he did that this was not in accordance with the custom of Sura. “I come from the city where Rav Judah is the head of the academy and there it is our custom to eat the udders of cows.” “You know the rule,” said Rav Chisda, “that a stranger who comes to a city in which there is a different religious custom from that of his own town should always follow the stricter practice of the two, and therefore you should not have eaten the udders.” To this Rami answered: “I ate the udders outside the city limits.” “And how did you roast them?” asked Rav Chisda. “With grape twigs,” replied Rami. “So, and what if they were the twigs of impure vines?” said Rav Chisda. Rami replied, “The twigs were more than twelve months old and all dry so that the law of impure vines does not apply to them.”
Later on they noticed that the man did not put on his phylacteries. When asked what was the reason for this, he replied: “I have stomach trouble and Rav Judah has ruled that anyone with stomach trouble is exempt from the duty of putting on phylacteries.” Later on they noticed that that man did not wear the ritual fringes on his garments. When he was asked the reason for this, he answered: “My garment is borrowed and Rav Judah has ruled that a borrowed garment need not be worn with ritual fringes.”
During this conversation Rami noticed that they were bringing in a man to be flogged for disrespect to his parents. When they had bound the man to a post, he said: “Let him go. Wherever the Bible promises a reward for observing a certain commandment, as in the case of the commandment to respect one’s father and mother, where the Bible promises long life for the observance of the law, the punishment for non-observance should be left to God and the courts of man should not deal with such cases.”<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין ק״י א׳ וב׳.</span></i>
Rav Judah bar Ezekiel developed a whole group who were famous as the keen minds of Pumbeditha,<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין י״ז ב׳.</span></i> and were said to be able “to drive an elephant through the eye of a needle” by their sharp logic.<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא ל״ח ב׳.</span></i> This sort of study was very popular with the younger students. There were others who did not care for Rav Judah’s form of learning, however, and they left his academy. Many of them even used the excuse that they were suddenly seized by a desire to go to Palestine. In truth however we may assume that the sophistry of Pumbeditha was a very important factor in their decision to leave. It may be assumed also that Rav Judah’s method of study was well known in Palestine also, and nobody granted it recognition. And when one of Rav Judah’s students, Rav Aba, decided to go to Palestine he was afraid of being ridiculed for his ways of argument. When he came to Palestine and said something the scholars did in fact laugh at him.<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ביצה ל״ח ב׳.</span></i>
Two years before the death of Rav Judah, Rav Huna died. Almost automatically Rav Judah became the head of all the Jews in Babylon. Since nobody was elected to take Rav Huna’s place, all his students came to study under Rav Judah in Pumbeditha.
Many of Rav Judah’s sayings prove that he was well-versed in natural history. This is not to be wondered at since he studied under Samuel Yarchinai who was always considered to be a great authority in such matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ע״ז ב׳.</span></i> He knew also the value of trees for human health and he said therefore that if one were out walking in the month of Nisan and saw the trees being covered with leaves, he must utter a special benediction.<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות מ״ג ב׳, ראש השנה י״א א׳.</span></i>
There is an interesting story about the conduct of Rav Judah when he was a student in Samuel’s school. Once a woman came, making an outcry about various injuries which had been done to her. Samuel paid no attention to her and to her outcries. Then Rav Judah said: “Don’t you respect the Biblical warning that anyone who stuffs his ears so as not to hear the outcries of the poor will some day have to cry out himself and no one will hear him?”<sup class="footnote-marker">30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת נ״ה א׳.</span></i>
It is related also that one of Rav Judah’s neighbors died without leaving any kin to mourn him; Rav Judah gathered together ten people to sit and mourn for him seven days. After the seventh day that man came to Rav Judah in a vision and thanked him for the kindness he had done him.<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קנ״ב ב׳.</span></i>
In teaching Rav Judah placed most stress upon the matter of damages and said that “Anyone who wants to pass as pious, must devote his attention to damages.”<sup class="footnote-marker">32)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא ל׳ א׳.</span></i> In his academy, too, most of the time was devoted to the study of the laws of damages.<sup class="footnote-marker">33)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית כ״ד ב׳.</span></i>
In spite of his greatness, Rav Judah did not make his learning a source of income, for it seems that he made his living from trading in wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">34)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא מ׳ א׳, חולין צ״ד א׳.</span></i>
Rav Judah was one of the tallest men of his time, but he only reached up to the shoulders of Rav.<sup class="footnote-marker">35)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדה כ״ב ב׳.</span></i> He also had large eyes<sup class="footnote-marker">36)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בכורות מ״ד א׳.</span></i> and when he grew old his eyesight was spoiled.<sup class="footnote-marker">37)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין י״ט ב׳.</span></i> He was also a sickly person and would faint from an empty stomach.<sup class="footnote-marker">38)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ל״ז ב׳.</span></i>
Of his regulations we need only mention that he made a rule for the writing of a <span dir="rtl">״שטר חליצה״</span> <span dir="ltr"><sup class="footnote-marker">39)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ל״ט ב׳.</span></i></span> and determined the form of the document for freeing a slave.<sup class="footnote-marker">40)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין פ״ו א׳.</span></i>

Rabah bar Nachmani

A<small>FTER</small> R<small>AV</small> J<small>UDAH BAR</small> E<small>ZEKIEL</small> died, the inhabitants of Pumbeditha decided unanimously that the head of their academy should be Rabah bar Nachmani. But he was very poor and in addition a very modest man and did not wish to accept. Since the “Heads of the Academy” in Sura were mostly wealthy men, Rabah thought that Pumbeditha should have the same distinction. So 400 scholars, apparently at the suggestion of Rabah himself went to Rav Huna bar Chiya<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">Not to be confused with Rav Huna the head of the academy in Sura or Rav Huna Raba the contemporary of Rabbi Judah Hanasi.</i>. and crowned him head of the academy in Pumbeditha.
However, it became known immediately that Rav Huna bar Chiya made his fortune as a tax-collector over the Babylonian Jews for the Persian king. This occupation was considered highly dishonorable at the time and it was a widely accepted opinion that a Jewish tax-collector who served a pagan king lost his share in Heaven. The scholars therefore sent a special delegation to Rav Huna bar Chiya saying: “Choose one of the two posts, either be head of the academy or tax-collector, for you cannot hold both these posts simultaneously.” Rav Huna bar Chiya immediately resigned his post as tax-collector. But many scholars did not content themselves with the fact that Rav Huna bar Chiya had given up his position as tax-collector, for they felt that once a man had held that position he no longer deserved the respect of the Jews.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בכורות ל״א א׳.</span></i>
And in fact the prestige and the honor of the academy in Pumbeditha suffered at that time and when Rav Huna died they had to pick a man for his position who could restore the good name of the Pumbeditha academy by his great learning and his personal virtues. There were only two suitable candidates for this post, Rabah bar Nachmani and Rav Joseph bar Chiya.
Both were famous scholars, the greatest in their time. During the period when Rav Huna bar Chiya was head of the academy in Pumbeditha, Rabah bar Nachmani continued to grow in importance and he was called the “uprooter of mountains,” meaning that he could pull up mountains and grind them to powder by the sheer force of his argumentation. Since they believed that Rabah bar Nachmani would not accept the position, they had to have a second candidate. This was Rav Joseph bar Chiya who was called “Sinai”, because all the laws of the Torah were so systematically arranged in his head that it seemed as though he had really heard them directly from the mouth of God on Mount Sinai. The Babylonian scholars did not know what to do. They sent to Palestine for advice. The Palestinians replied that since “Sinai” is more important than an “uprooter of hills”, they should choose the “Sinai”. But Rav Joseph bar Chiya did not wish to accept the position because an astrologer once told him that if he became the head of an academy he would not live to officiate any longer than two years.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ס״ד א׳, הוריות י״ד א׳.</span></i> Immediately on receiving this news the scholars forced Rabah bar Nachmani to accept the position. He had immediate success in raising the prestige of the academy in Pumbeditha, where twelve thousand people and sometimes more would gather in the school-months of Adar and Elul.
The dates of Rabah bar Nachmani’s birth and death are obscure. The accepted opinion is that he lived no more than forty years.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ח א׳.</span></i> In another place it is said that Rabah’s brothers told him to study with Rabbi Jochanan in Palestine<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות קי״א א׳.</span></i> and later it is said that he was head of the academy in Pumbeditha for twenty-two years<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ס״ד א׳.</span></i> and according to the “Chronicle of Rav Shrira Gaon” he died in the year 330 C. E. so that we must conclude that he lived much more than 40 years. Otherwise our Rabah would have had to be less than ten years old when he was a student of Rabbi Jochanan.
According to the Talmud, Rabah bar Nachmani came from a town called Mimla (Mimalis) in Babylonia, the majority of whose inhabitants were priests and, as they then believed, all of them were descendents of the family of the High Priest Eli, upon whom there rested a curse that all the males of his family would die early. Thus every traveller who visited Mimla would wonder at the absence of elderly people.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בראשית רבה פּרשה נ״ט פּיסקא א׳.</span></i> It is related also that Rabah bar Nachmani had three brothers whose names were Chailil, Rav Chanina and Rav Oshaya, all three of whom were extremely poor. Rav Chanina and Rav Oshaya went to Palestine where they made a living making shoes. And since they avoided sin very carefully they were known as “the holy Rabbis of the land of Israel.” Their virtue expressed itself in the fact that although they sat in the market of the prostitutes and sewed their shoes and the prostitutes cast lecherous eyes upon them, they did not pay heed to these glances.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים ק״י ב׳.</span></i>
From early youth Rabah bar Nachmani excelled in acumen. Like many other Babylonian scholars he went to Palestine as a young man to study, and when he returned to Babylon to study with Rav Nachman bar Jacob and with Rav Huna and Rav Chisda, his brothers would continually pound it into his head to go back to Palestine and study there. He obeyed them and returned to Palestine for a short time. However his keen mind found no satisfaction in the simplicity characteristic of learning in Palestine and he returned again to Babylon.
As we have noted Rabah was very poor and in addition he was an ailing person. People used to remark the injustice of fate, saying that Rabah was as great a saint as Rav Chisda had been, and yet Rav Chisda lived to the age of ninety-two and Rabah lived only to the age of forty. Rav Chisda lived to see sixty marriages among his children and grandchildren and Rabah’s household suffered from sixty kinds of ailment. Rav Chisda’s deer disdained to eat the finest wheat and the people of Rabah’s house sought a bit of oaten meal and could not find it.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ח א׳.</span></i>
As head of the academy it was Rabah’s effort to try to popularize what he had heard from his teachers. In addition he specialized in the laws of ritual purity and tried to make them intelligible to his students; though he found few auditors for this subject, because people were interested in studying the laws which were still in force and not the laws of the Messianic era. As our Rabah complained: “I am alone in studying the laws of blight and the laws of the impurity of a tent.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פ״ו א׳.</span></i> In his lectures Rabah bar Nachmani would give all the relevant aspects of a matter with great understanding, and would often weave a bit of legend into his legal disquisitions, to mend the ardure of the law with a portion of poetry. When he was teaching his students he had a custom of starting with a <i>"bon mot"</i> to capture the attention of the students.
For all these reasons the scholars held Rabah bar Nachmani in high honor, both because of his clear grasp of the Torah and his own virtues. Still, since he was a man of truth and very strict in the observance of the laws, and respected no sinner but punished them severely for their transgressions, the mob in Pumbeditha hated him.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קנ״ג א׳.</span></i> Once when there was no rain, Rabah ordered a fast and prescribed the prayers to be said. None of this was of any avail. People said to him: “It seems that God held Rav Judah bar Ezekiel more dear because no prayer of his went unanswered.” To this Rabah bar Nachmani answered: “It is not by our fault that God is keeping back the rain, because in our knowledge of the Torah we are greater than Rav Judah’s generation. But what can we do if the people today are not as good as the people of that generation?”<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית כ״ד ב׳.</span></i>
For the greater part of his life Rabah was very poor. As a result he had to depend on the aid of the Exilarch. The heads of the academy in Sura were rich, and usually maintained their students at their own expense. The heads of the academy in Pumbeditha, on the other hand, were poor folk and boxes had to be set up into which anyone who was able to do so threw his contribution to support the head of the academy of Pumbeditha and his students.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ס׳ ב׳.</span></i>
At that time there also began a series of religious persecutions against the Jews of Babylon, and even though they were mere child’s play compared to the persecutions which broke out in Palestine at the same time, nevertheless they did upset the political security which the Jews had enjoyed up to that time. The historical accounts of these events are very meager, yet they were serious enough so that Rabah bar Nachmani lost his life through their effects. They came during the reign of king Sapor the Second. He ruled longer than any other Persian king before him or after him, sitting on the throne more than a full human life. (309-380 C. E.) He was crowned king before he was born for the priests placed the crown on the pregnant body of his mother, Ifra Hurmiz in sign that the unborn child was the king of Persia.
Between King Sapor I, who was a friend of Samuel Yarchinai, and King Sapor II there was an interval of about seventy years (240-309 C. E.) In this interval six different kings ruled the Persians, and all maintained the tradition of friendship towards the Jews which had been established by king Sapor I. King Sapor II broke this tradition. Then all over the Persian kingdom persecution of the Jews broke out and because of the Jews the Christians too were persecuted.
Yet the condition of the Jews at that time was better than that of the Christians because Queen Ifra Hurmiz protected the Jews to the extent of her ability. It is said that Queen Ifra Hurmiz had a strong leaning toward the Jewish religion and respected the Jewish scholars. When she saw how severely her son was oppressing the Jews, crushing the marrow out of their bones for taxes, she took a pot of gold to the academy at Pumbeditha and gave it to the scholars to be used as they saw fit. It was decided to use this money to help those Jews who could not pay their taxes and were in danger of being sent to jail by the king.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא ח׳ א׳.</span></i>
Concerning those persecutions the Talmud relates that when the royal army came to Pumbeditha, Rabah bar Nachmani and Rav Joseph bar Chiya ran away.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין מ״ו א׳.</span></i> Then the king was told that there was a certain Jew around whom twelve thousand others would gather two months during the year, once during the winter and once during the summer, thus interfering with the work of the people and causing the king’s treasury damage. The king sent out messengers to catch Rabah. Rabah heard of this and fled and hid among the swamps around Pumbeditha. He lost his way there and came to a forest and sat down under a tree. Suddenly he heard the footsteps of a man, and thinking that he was caught, he died of fright.
This flight and hiding of Rabah bar Nachmani has been adorned with many miracles. It is related that once in the course of his flight he met the king’s messenger at an inn and was miraculously delivered from his hands. Then it is related how Rabah died in a miraculous manner. In the “academy of Heaven” a difference of opinion developed concerning a certain problem in the laws of ritual purity, and God Himself decided “pure”, and the rest of the academy decided “impure”. It was decided to call on Rabah bar Nachmani for his opinion because this was his special field. But this was impossible so long as he was alive and they sent out the Angel of Death to fetch Rabah. But the Angel of Death could not approach him because he did not cease studying a moment. Then the Angel of Death determined upon the above-mentioned trick, making Rabah think that he was caught, and he interrupted his study for a moment. The Angel of Death used this moment to seize his soul and bring it to the “academy of Heaven”. The scholars in Pumbeditha did not know what had happened to Rabah. A note fell from Heaven saying, “Rabah bar Nachmani has been summoned to the ‘academy of Heaven’.”
Then Abayei and Rava along with other scholars went to seek Rabah’s corpse in order to bury it. They did not know the place where his body lay. They went to the swamps where Rabah had been hiding. They saw a flock of birds and the scholars said: “Apparently our dead is lying there.” They mourned for Rabah three days and three nights. Then another note fell from Heaven, upon which was written: “Whoever abandons the dead man now is excommunicated.” The scholars mourned for Rabah seven days longer. Then another note fell from Heaven, saying, “Go home in peace.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פ״ו א׳.</span></i>
Wherever the Talmud mentions Rabah without a patronymic, it means Rabah bar Nachmani. Concerning the years of his life we must add that apparently he studied with Rabbi Jochanan in his early years, for it is related that Rav Chisda once said to him what he used to say to others of Rabbi Jochanan’s students: “Who pays any attention to you and your teacher, Rabbi Jochanan?”<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדרים נ״ט א׳.</span></i> We must remember that Rabah’s brothers insisted on his going to Palestine to study and they wrote him: “Although you are a very learned person, there is no comparison between studying by oneself and studying with a teacher; and if you should say that there is no teacher in Palestine we tell you there is. And who is he? Rabbi Jochanan.”<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות קי״א א׳.</span></i>
Before Rabah bar Nachmani went to Palestine, he studied with Rav Huna, the head of the academy in Sura<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין כ״ז א׳, בבא מציעא י״ח ב׳.</span></i> and after Rav Huna died Rabah went to Rav Chisda to study. His manner of study with Rav Chisda was not like that of a student and a teacher but like that of two colleagues.<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין ל״ח ב׳, ביצה כ״ח א׳.</span></i> Not long afterwards Rabah left Sura and went to Pumbeditha to study with Rav Judah bar Ezekiel.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין מ׳ ב׳.</span></i>

Rav Joseph bar Chiya

A<small>FTER</small> R<small>ABAH BAR</small> N<small>ACHMANI’S</small> death Rav Joseph bar Chiya had to accept the position of head of the academy in Pumbeditha. For a long time they had been considered the two greatest scholars, and, as we have said, Rabah was called the “uprooter of mountains” meaning that he could tear up hills and grind them into dust by the power of his reasoning and Rav Joseph bar Chiya was called “Sinai” because all the laws of the Torah were as systematically arranged in his head as if he had heard them directly from the mouth of God on Mount Sinai. When the scholars wanted to appoint him head of the academy in Pumbeditha before they chose Rabah bar Nachmani, he went to consult an astrologer.
This Rav Joseph bar Chiya, who is always called simply Rav Joseph without a patronymic, was born about 270 C. E. and died 333 C. E. He was a sick man, always ailing, and very irritable. He would say, “There are three kinds of people whose life is not worth living; merciful people, angry people and sensitive people, and I have inherited all these qualities.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים קי״ג ב׳.</span></i> It is related that later he grew even sicker and even became blind. He was not pained by the fact that he had to live in the darkness, but because he was exempt from all those commandments which require vision.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא פּ״ז א׳.</span></i> Then Rav Joseph again suffered from a very severe illness, through which he lost his memory and all his learning. It then happened several times that some of Rav Joseph’s own laws came up in study and he said that he had never heard of them, and had to be reminded that they were his own.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין י׳ א׳, נדרים מ״א א׳.</span></i> Then he would say that just as the whole and the broken tablets of the Mosaic law lay side by side in the Holy Ark, so we must infer that when a scholar has forgotten his learning he must not be humiliated.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מנחות צ״ט א׳.</span></i> Concerning his blindness it is not known whether this occurred before his last sickness and whether he remained blind until the end.
Unlike Rabah bar Nachmani, Rav Joseph bar Chiya was a wealthy man, who owned gold and silver, fields and vineyards of such excellent quality that his wine could be diluted with twice as much water as could be mixed with ordinary wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מנחות פ״ז א׳.</span></i> It sounds somewhat strange therefore when he says that “poverty suits a Jew like a red accoutrement suits a white horse.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה ט׳ ב׳.</span></i>
On his sixtieth birthday, when he invited other scholars to a feast he said, in a similar whimsical vein: “No matter how I misbehave I can no longer die young.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ח א׳.</span></i>
Rav Joseph was different from his colleague Rabah in all his ways, in his private conduct as well as in his manner of studying. Though he was modest, he said “a teacher who has no regard for his dignity, has no dignity.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ל״ב ב׳.</span></i> The difference between the scholarship of Rabah and that of Rav Joseph was many-sided. Rabah would usually depend upon his own reason and never hesitated if his opinion was that in the minority, and when he brought proof of his contentions they ordinarily were of a very complex sort and at first sight subject to objections of various sorts.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת כ״ג ב׳, ערובין י״ט ב׳, בבא בתרא ל״א א׳, עבודה זרה מ״א א׳.</span></i> Rav Joseph’s sayings were based, on the other hand, upon simple declarations and did not require complex reasoning, because he always kept the Mishnah and the Boraitha in mind, and avoided refinements and interpretations.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת י״ח א׳, ערובין כ״ט ב׳, כתובות פ״א ב׳, מנחות ע״ה ב׳.</span></i>
Since it was known that Rav Joseph was acquainted with metaphysics and cosmology, he was often asked to teach these subjects to his students. He would never agree to do so, however, and when they pressed him hard he evaded them with a quotation, interpreting the verse “honey and milk under your tongue” to mean that when some subject is as good as honey and milk it should be kept under the tongue and not expressed.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חגיגה י״ג א׳.</span></i>
Rav Joseph bar Chiya also paid much attention to the Aramaic translation of the Bible and especially to the “Haftaroth”. Since the masses understood very little Hebrew, the biblical portions that had to be read on Sabbath and holidays were to be read in the Babylonian tongue. Rav Joseph tried to prepare a correct translation of these synagogual readings in the Chaldean language, following the Greek translation of Aquilas (or Onkelos the convert) and this became the basis of our “Targum Onkelos.”
He was very fond of using folk-proverbs in his scholarly statements, as for instance: “A master who makes a spoon may still burn his tongue with it when it is full of broth,”<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים כ״ח א׳.</span></i> or “even if you utter curses upon a dog’s tail, he will continue to do the same thing.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן י״ז א׳.</span></i>
Since Rav Joseph was very rich he fed his students at his own table, stating their number as about four hundred.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ק״ו א׳.</span></i> It is said that he was very modest and was aware of it himself and when people said that since the death of Rabbi Judah Hanasi modesty had died out among the Jews, he said: “Do not say that, for I am here.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוטה מ״ט ב׳.</span></i>
Along with Rabah bar Abahu, Rav Joseph held that just as Jews should not leave Palestine to come to Babylon, so Babylonians should not leave their homes to go to another country, even not so far as from Pumbeditha to Be-Kobi, which was the nearest city. When someone left Pumbeditha for Be-Kobi, Rav Joseph excommunicated him. Another person left Pumbeditha for Asthonia, which is located in southern Mesopotamia, and he died at once.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות קי״א א׳.</span></i>
When he was nearing his end, Rav Joseph wanted assurance that the Torah would remain in his family and he fasted forty days until he saw in a dream the verse “my words which I have placed in thy mouth will not pass from out of thy mouth” (Isaiah 59, 21). Not being satisfied with this he fasted forty more days until he was shown the verse “they shall not pass from thy mouth and from the mouth of thy seed.” When he fasted another hundred days he was shown the verse “they shall not pass from thy mouth and from the mouth of thy seed and from the mouth of the seed of thy seed.” With this he was satisfied, for knowing that his grandchildren would be scholars also, he believed that the Torah would remain in his family.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פ״ה א׳.</span></i>

Rabah bar Rav Huna

Rav Huna, the head of the academy in Sura, left a son named Rabah, who studied a great deal with his father and also inherited all his good qualities. When this Rabah bar Rav Huna died, the academy at Sura was orphaned, for it lacked a great central personality. Then the greater part of its students left it, and went to Pumbeditha to study. It seems that Rabah bar Rav Huna was fortunate enough to have studied under Rav and Samuel. He quoted many Talmudical sayings in their name. Later he went to Palestine and studied a short time under Rabbi Jochanan.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים צ׳ א׳, בבא בתרא קל״ה ב׳.</span></i> Later he headed his own academy, even while Rav Chisda, who succeeded Rav Huna to the position of the head of the academy in Sura, was still alive.
It is certain that Rav Huna urged his son to be friendly with Rav Chisda because once when Rabah omitted his visits to Rav Chisda, Rav Huna punished him and Rabah had to defend himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת פ״ב א׳.</span></i> In addition Rabah was a judge in Rav Chisda’s court<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת י׳ א׳.</span></i> and Rav Chisda regarded him so highly that in spite of the difference in age Rav Chisda would often honor him by attending his lectures.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין מ״ו א׳.</span></i>
Yet the achievements of Rabah bar Rav Huna in the development of the Talmud are practically unknown. It is known only that he was modest and would treat inferiors respectfully when dealing with them. In addition he was also quite rich, with fields and forests of his own from which he made his living.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא ק״ח א׳.</span></i> Even in later times Rabah’s modesty was still a matter of comment and many of the later “Amoraim” expressed the wish that they might attain to Rabah bar Rav Huna’s modesty.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ח א׳.</span></i>
Rabah bar Rav Huna’s relations with the Exilarch are highly interesting. It is not clear how close these were. In spite of the fact that he would make the “holiday visits” to the Exilarch with Rav Chisda<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סוכה י׳ ב׳.</span></i> and when the Amora Ula once came to the Exilarch on the Sabbath he found Rabah there,<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קנ״ז ב׳.</span></i> this is not to be taken as an unequivocal sign of loyalty and devotion, because it may be that these occurrences were limited to the time of Rav Chisda’s life. Later when Rabah bar Rav Huna became an independent leader of an academy in Sura, he once had a quarrel with the men of the Exilarch and he said: “I did not get my right to teach from you, but from Rav (Aba Arecha) and Rav got it from Rav Chiya and Rav Chiya got it from Rabbi Jehuda Hanasi.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ה׳ א׳.</span></i>
Rabah bar Rav Huna died at the same time as Rav Hamnuna and they were both brought for burial to Palestine. The two coffins were carried abreast all the way until they came to a narrow bridge where they had to go in single file one behind the other. The camels which bore the coffins stopped still before the bridge. A travelling merchant approached and asked why they had suddenly stopped. They told him that they were bringing two scholars to burial and each one desired his colleague to precede him. After the travelling merchant was told who the two scholars were, he said that Rabah bar Rav Huna should go first. They sent Rabah’s camel ahead. But this, it seems, did not please the dead scholar, because his camel kicked up his heels and knocked out the merchant’s teeth.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ה ב׳.</span></i>

Abayei bar Chyailil

W<small>HEN</small> R<small>ABAH BAR</small> R<small>AV</small> H<small>UNA</small> was at the head of the academy in Sura the Pumbedithans could not unite on a candidate for the position of head of the academy to take the place of Rav Joseph bar Chiya. There were four men who were considered for the position: Abayei bar Chyailil, Rava (Rav Aba bar Chama, the priest) Rav Zeira the second and Raba bar Matana. These four agreed to resolve some difficulty about a law and the one whose answer would be the best, clearest and unanswerable, would be crowned as the head of the academy of Pumbeditha. Abayei won this contest, because his remarks were not subject to criticism. Thus he was chosen as the head of the academy.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">הוריות י״ד א׳.</span></i>
Abayei was born in the year 280 C. E. and died about 338 C. E. He is often called Nachmani after his grandfather Nachmani, the father of Rabah, at whose home he was brought up. His father died before he was born and his mother died in giving birth, and his uncle Rabah took the orphaned child to bring him up. He acquired his great legal learning from this uncle of his. He also inherited his depth and keenness from him. Besides this he was characterized by nobility of character and a pure-mindedness which was best expressed in the following saying: “A man should always be open-hearted in his dealings with God, friendly and careful, never to anger anyone. Particularly must he be at peace with his relations as well as with every other person, even a pagan in the street, so that he may be loved by all who are superior to him and welcome to all who are inferior.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות י״ז א׳.</span></i>
With a childlike respect Abayei mentions his nurse who took the place of his mother and gave him various bits of counsel in life, and concerning human nature and the nature of the world. He quotes a score of her remarks with the greatest esteem as though they had been the sayings of some prominent Rabbi. He would usually preface these sayings with the words “my foster-mother said to me,” and all these quotations show that this nurse of Abayei must have been an extraordinary woman with a great deal of experience and broad understanding.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קל״ד א׳, ערובין כ״ט ב׳, יומא ע״ח ב׳, מועד קטן י״ב א׳, כתובות י׳ ב׳.</span></i> It is probable also that this woman deserved the honor which Abayei paid her, for she cared for him like the apple of her eye, and saw that he lacked nothing, and was not disturbed in his studies. He said in one place that if his foster-mother had asked him to do the smallest thing, he would be disturbed in his studies.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין ס״ה א׳.</span></i>
Abayei owned gardens and vineyards which he ordinarily rented out to tenants for cultivation. Yet it is uncertain whether he was wealthy, because he led a modest life, as we see by the fact that when Abayei’s widow asked the court to grant her food and wine, they answered that as far as they knew there was never any wine on Abayei’s table.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ס״ה א׳.</span></i>
We may see how widespread was Abayei’s fame from the fact that even the Samaritans, who normally lived on bad terms with the Jews, were admirers of Abayei. Once they found a lost ass of his and they returned it on his saying that it was his, without asking for any signs of identification.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין מ״ה א׳.</span></i> It is therefore a puzzle why the number of students in Pumbeditha decreased to two hundred from the previous mass of thousands during the time that Abayei was head of the academy in Pumbeditha. We may assume that this decline in the number of students in Pumbeditha was not because the desire for learning grew suddenly weaker among the Jews of Babylon, but because all the students at that time tried to go to Mechoza, drawn by the personality of the head of the academy there, Rava, who, although he had the same system of study as Abayei, was nevertheless always found to be in conflicts with him, in which the students tended more to Rava’s side.
Almost all the scholars at that time had ceased to feel the need to make new interpretations of the commandments of the Torah. As everybody thought then, the laws of the Jewish religion had already been interpreted in every possible way. It was at this time that Abayei and Rava began to turn up new problems which had not yet been covered by others. These were problems which developed out of the daily life of the people and had not previously been noticed. Their attempts to solve these problems as best they could are known in the Talmud as <span dir="rtl">״הוויות דאביי ורבא״</span> (discussions of hypothetical cases which may sometimes arise.)
In order to explain the nature of these <span dir="rtl">״הוויות״</span> more clearly we will mention two of them. One question was as follows: When witnesses appeared and testified to a certain matter, and later others came and proved that those witnesses had lied, their credibility as witnesses was lost forever and they were no longer trusted. Now the problem is how far back did this losing of their credibility reach? Did it begin with their false testimony or only after the proof of the lie was established? For if these witnesses had signed documents or given true testimony in other matters during the interval between their false testimony and its proof of a lie, the question arises whether their signatures or their later testimony should be credited or not.
The second question was whether a money-lender, getting collateral from the borrower has the rights of the owner to the property from the very first day of the loan and could dispose of it according to his own wishes or has he only the right to do so if it is clear that the borrower cannot or will not pay his debt?
There are a number of different opinions about the length of time that Abayei was the head of the academy in Pumbeditha. Some say that is was only five years and others say that it was twelve or thirteen. Towards the end of Abayei’s life bad news began to be heard from Palestine. The Jews were being terribly oppressed by Emperor Constantius. Many refugees from Palestine arrived in Pumbeditha, bringing with them the learning of Rabbi Jochanan, and they aided in the further development of the law in Babylon.
These people told Abayei, citing Rabbi Jochanan as their authority, that a woman whose two first husbands had died was allowed to wed a third time, for Rabbi Jochanan held that it could not be declared that such a woman was one whose husbands died because of her sins. Abayei accepted Rabbi Jochanan’s opinion and immediately married the beautiful woman Huma, a grandchild of Rav Judah bar Ezekiel, who had already been twice a widow. And after she married Abayei, he soon died at the age of fifty-eight.
His name was Abayei bar Chyailil the priest, and as the “Chronicle of Rav Sherira Gaon” relates, this Chyailil was the brother of Rabah bar Nachmani. Neither the meaning of the name “Chyailil” nor that of “Abayei” is known. Some say about this that the name Abayei is an anagram of the verse <span dir="rtl">״אשר בך ירוחם יתום״</span>. Others say that the name “Abayei” is a Syrian name, meaning solace, which is almost equivalent to Nachmani as others called him.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ל״ג א׳, נדרים נ״ד ב׳.</span></i> At the time when Abayei was born his uncle Rabah bar Nachmani was still a young man, not more than 17 years old. He was a student under Rav Judah bar Ezekiel in Pumbeditha. When Abayei had grown up somewhat his uncle immediately sent him to study in the academy of his own teacher. And even though the work there was beyond Abayei’s comprehension at the time, his uncle wished him to hear it anyway. When Abayei was mature enough to grasp what he was being taught, his teachers were Rabah bar Nachmani and Rav Joseph bar Chiya, who had become the leaders of the academy in Pumbeditha. Abayei acted towards his uncle like a pupil towards his teacher, with deep respect mixed with a certain childlike love. Rabah bar Nachmani also was always trying to fill up his young nephew with every variety of wisdom, and to sharpen his mind in every possible way.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ל״ג א׳.</span></i> For Rav Joseph bar Chiya, Abayei felt nothing but respect. It is related that when Abayei saw the ears of Rav Joseph’s ass, as a sign that his teacher was approaching, he would stand up in respect.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ל״ג א׳.</span></i>
Even when Abayei was still young he was famous for the depth of his learning. He had his own academy even when his teacher Rav Joseph bar Chiya was still alive.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא כ״ב א׳.</span></i> As we have said Rav Joseph once forgot his learning in his illness. Abayei would often remind him of his own laws. But even before this, Rav Joseph would discuss various problems with Abayei, treating him like a colleague and not like a student.
Abayei grew up from childhood with his colleague Rava.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות מ״ב א׳.</span></i> Later things developed in such a way that while Abayei was studying with Rabah bar Nachmani, Rava studied with Rav Nachman bar Jacob in Mechoza and Nehardea. This was the reason for the continuous differences of opinion between them which were always prosecuted in a friendly spirit. The phrase which the Talmud uses “Abayei and Rava who both say” refers to the time when they were studying together. In addition we find many times, “Abayei questioned Rava” or “Abayei explained to Rava.”
Abayei was very scrupulous about the cleanliness of people who go out into the street. Since people were very careful to wash their hands and mouth before eating, Abayei said, “It is even more important to wash the hands and mouth after eating.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין י״ז ב׳.</span></i> Concerning the problem of leavened bread on Passover or after Passover, which must not be used, Abayei said that if a person uses it against his will he has not committed a sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים כ״ה ב׳.</span></i> Concerning a divorce he said that talk of giving a woman a divorce does not impose the obligation to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ל״ד א׳.</span></i> If a man says to a woman that he weds her with a gift of a previous loan, the marriage is not valid, but, if he says that he weds her with the gift of the interest on that loan, then the marriage is legal.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ז׳ ב׳.</span></i>
If a witness came to court and testified that he saw a certain thing and later another witness proved that the first had lied, making his testimony inadmissible forever, Abayei said that this inadmissibility begins with the moment of the false testimony.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא ע״ג א׳.</span></i> Concerning the mortgaged property of a debtor, Abayei said that the property belongs to the moneylender from the moment of the loan and he can dispose of it as if it were his own.<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ל״ד א׳.</span></i>
Another important problem was when someone lost something and gave it up for lost. This gave the finder the right to keep it. But if the loser was unaware of his loss this was called “unconscious renunciation” and Abayei held that this was not true renunciation, and any finder had no right to keep his find.<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא כ״א ב׳.</span></i>
Abayei often used folk proverbs in his lectures, as for instance when he said: “Let no man open his mouth to evil, lest he give the Satan a chance to do harm.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות י״ט א׳.</span></i> On another occasion he said: “A servant who angers her mistress very often gets paid for it all at once”,<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ל״ב א׳.</span></i> or “When a peasant becomes a king, one can always detect the place of his origin”.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מגלה ז׳ ב׳.</span></i>
When Abayei studied with his uncle Rabah bar Nachmani, he did not cease day or night, and when he was asked why he did not make an “Eruv”<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">The law forbidding the carrying of objects from one place to another on the Sabbath was overcome by an “Eruv”. This created an artificial boundary, by wiring the outskirt of the city or town, and thus they were allowed to transport objects from one place to another.</i> at the entrance of his house he said: “How can I keep such things in mind, when I am always busy studying?”<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין ס״ח ב׳.</span></i>
Abayei was afflicted with illness a long time. He suffered from so-called “watery stomach” which did not permit regular digestion of food so that he was simply starved.<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ל״ג א׳.</span></i> He was unable to perform the priest’s duties in the synagogue because of his ailment.<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">חולין קל״ג א׳.</span></i> He suffered a great deal also from bad teeth.<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא פ״ד א׳.</span></i> His mouth was full of dangerous sores around his teeth, for which he used various remedies which did him no good, until a travelling merchant came to Pumbeditha, and gave him the right remedy.<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה כ״ח א׳.</span></i>
To be able to put on phylacteries, which required a clean body, was apparently considered a cause for rejoicing by our scholars at the time. It is related that Abayei was once sitting with his uncle Rabah bar Nachmani and saw that he was very pleased about something. Abayei asked how it was that his uncle alowed himself to be over-happy when the Bible warned to “rejoice with trembling.” His uncle answered: “I have just worn my phylacteries.”<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ל׳ ב׳.</span></i>
As we said above Abayei owned gardens and vineyards which he rented out to tenants, but he worked in the fields himself nevertheless. It seems that he had an agreement with his tenants concerning this, for it is related that he sat and studied all day and at night he irrigated his fields. And when a student came to him once and asked him to study with him, Abayei replied that he could not do it because all his time was taken up, what with his own study during the day and irrigating his fields during the night.<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ס׳ ב׳.</span></i>
After the death of Rav Joseph bar Chiya they had to choose a head of the academy in Pumbeditha, and when Abayei emerged as the victor over three other candidates his name grew even more famous than before. This attracted large numbers of students to him and he said: “The reward for hearing the Rabbi’s lecture is the crush trying to get in to hear.”<sup class="footnote-marker">29)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ו׳ ב׳.</span></i> He had great love for his students and he said: “May it be remembered that whenever I saw that a student had finished a tractate of the Talmud, I made a celebration for the scholars.”<sup class="footnote-marker">30)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ח ב׳.</span></i>
It is related that every Friday evening Abayei would receive a greeting from Heaven. He then heard that the pious Aba Umna got such a greeting every day. This irked him, not because the other had such great merit, but because he had not such merit; so he sent a few students to investigate the merit of that Aba Umna. They discovered that Aba Umna was really great in his good deeds and deserved the distinction.<sup class="footnote-marker">31)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית כ״א ב׳.</span></i>
Abayei was tolerant and would think the best of everybody, since he understood that it was impossible for a man to sit and study all the time.<sup class="footnote-marker">32)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ל״ג א׳.</span></i> Similarly he would say that the whole world could not be like Father Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">33)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ע״ו א׳.</span></i> And if a scholar did not know something that was no proof that he was not a great man.<sup class="footnote-marker">34)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ו׳ ב׳.</span></i>
When Abayei once had to scold the people for a carelessness in regard to Sabbath observance, he said, that this was the very cause of the destruction of Jerusalem.<sup class="footnote-marker">35)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ט א׳.</span></i> When Abayei saw that there were Jews who helped the government in its merciless squeezing of money out of the Jews, he told a story of a Jewish royal officer who was bitten by a snake and could not be aided by any remedies. All this was a result of the fact that he had no regard for the honor of the scholars, whose bite is as the bite of the snake.
Because of Abayei’s descent from Eli the High Priest, he should have lived forty years like his uncle Rabah bar Nachmani. But he spent much time in study and charitable works and therefore an exception was made for him out of his whole family and he lived sixty years.<sup class="footnote-marker">36)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה י״ח א׳.</span></i>

Rava bar Joseph bar Chama

T<small>HE NEAREST FRIEND</small> of Abayei bar Chyailil was Rava, the son of Rav Joseph bar Chama, who is always called simply “Rava.” Even though the two were always sharply divided in opinion and lived far apart also, they are nevertheless always mentioned together. They were brought together from the days of their youth, though the details of this are not known. In spite of their conflicts of opinion there are rare instances in which they said the same thing.
It is interesting that when their differences are mentioned, Abayei is usually mentioned first and then Rava. We cannot deduce from this, however, that Abayei was the greater of the two. It is simply because Abayei became famous first by winning a contest for the position of the head of the academy of Pumbeditha. In addition it should be mentioned that even though Rava headed his own academy in Mechoza, he would often go to Pumbeditha to hear Abayei’s opinion in matters which he found somewhat difficult to decide by himself.
Rava learned most of what he knew from Rav Nachman bar Jacob, who laid the foundation of all his learning. Every one of Rav Nachman’s words was carved deep in his memory and anyone who found some difficulty in Rav Nachman’s words would come to Rava for an explanation. Before he studied with Rav Nachman bar Jacob, Rava was a student of Rabah bar Avuha. Later he studied a great deal under Rav Huna and Rav Chisda, whose daughter he married after she was widowed of her husband, Rami bar Chama.
Concerning this marriage it is related that when Rav Chisda’s daughter was a child and sat upon her father’s knee while he was teaching, the two students who sat in the first row were Rami bar Chama and Rava, trying to hear exactly what their teacher said. Rav Chisda asked the child which of the two students she wished to have for her husband, and the child answered, “I want both.” To this Rava answered: “First Rami will be her husband and then I.” And so it happened in fact. First Rav Chisda’s daughter married Rami bar Chama and after she was widowed she married Rava.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא י״ב ב׳.</span></i>
For a while after Rav Nachman’s death, Rava studied under Rav Joseph bar Chiya and also under Rav Sheshet.
It is said that Rava was blessed with riches. He had fields and vineyards which he hired out to tenants. He also engaged in trade and owned ships.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא קנ״ג א׳.</span></i> Because of his riches he was able to keep the whole population of Mechoza under his control. And being blessed with wisdom also he was accorded the greatest respect by everybody. Therefore he would say concerning himself that “I requested the Almighty to give me the wisdom of Rav Huna and the riches of Rav Chisda and He gave them to me. There is only one good thing which I have not been granted. I prayed the Lord to grant me the modesty of Rabah bar Rav Huna and I did not receive it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ח א׳.</span></i> But it may be said with certainty that what Rava says about his modesty is not true. Some of his sayings prove that he could compare with the greatest of the prominent modest men. Only through modesty could a person in Rava’s place have the insight that “When a man does not insist upon the dignity of his rank, God pardons his sins.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא כ״ג א׳.</span></i> And in speaking of learning Rava said that “the Torah was not given to angels.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות כ״ה ב׳.</span></i> Once too he mentioned the verse “it is not in Heaven” referring to the Torah, and he said that Torah cannot be grasped by those who are as proud in their opinions as the height of Heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין נ״ה א׳.</span></i> At the end of his prayer every day, Rava would say: “Before I was born I did not deserve to be born, and now that I am born I am as though I had never been born. Dust am I in my life and how much more so after my death.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות י״ז א׳, יומא פ״ז ב׳.</span></i>
It was characteristic of Rava also that he loved truth and hated flattery fearfully.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ק״ה ב׳.</span></i> Therefore he said; “A scholar who is otherwise when alone than he appears in company cannot be considered a scholar.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יומא ע״ב ב׳.</span></i> Rava did much to increase the honor of the Torah and scholars flocked around him in thousands. He asked, however, that they should not come to him in the months of Nisan and Tishri, for in Nisan the harvest was gathered in from the fields, and in Tishri the grapes were trodden in the winepress, because in these two months people prepared their livelihood for the rest of the year.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ל״ה ב׳.</span></i><sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">These are not the same as the “Lecture months,” Elul and Adar, when the scholars did gather to study the laws of the oncoming holidays.</i>
Rava had his school in Mechoza. It seems that he was born there and his father, Rav Joseph bar Chama, had his own school there in the days of Rabah bar Avuha, after Papa bar Netzer destroyed Nehardea and the scholars had to flee. Mechoza was a large city in which the Jews were a majority of the population. Most of the people were merchants.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ו׳ א׳.</span></i> Some were very wealthy.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא קי״ט א׳.</span></i> The happy situation of the Jews in Mechoza caused many pagans to be converted.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ע״ג א׳.</span></i>
Nevertheless there were poor people in Mechoza, as we may see by the fact that when Rafram bar Papa spoke in praise of Rav Huna saying that when he broke fast he would have his gates and doors opened to every needy person to come and eat with him, Rava replied: “All this could be imitated here except the part of breaking fast with bread for we have here too many poor people who would be glad to come if they were invited.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית כ׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Rava founded a center of Jewish learning in this town which competed successfully with the academy in Pumbeditha. In a city of such a mixed population it is easily understood that the head of the academy needed a large degree of tolerance towards the various elements. It is remarkable therefore that Rava instructed his children not to marry converts.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ה׳ ב׳.</span></i> This might make us think that Rava was very careful never to come in contact with pagans. Yet he once sent a certain pagan named Bar-Shishach a present, or perhaps even a “sacrifice” in honor of a pagan holiday, for he said that this Bar-Shishach was not an idolater.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה ס״ה א׳.</span></i>
We may see how Rava venerated the Torah from the fact that when he saw Rav Hamnuna spending a long time at his prayers, he said: “People abandon eternal life and devote themselves to their temporal interests,”<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת י׳ א׳.</span></i> from which we may infer that Rava did not consider prayer to be particularly important, and the scholars who observed the commandments of the Torah were far more important in his eyes, as he would say, “How foolish are those people who stand up before a Bible scroll and do not stand up before a great man.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מכות כ״ב ב׳.</span></i>
Rava’s attitude to poor people is particularly interesting. It is said that when a poor man came to Rava once and asked for food, Rava asked him: “What sort of food do you ordinarily eat?” The pauper replied: “I am accustomed to eat stuffed birds and to wash them down with old wine.” To this Rava said: “Aren’t you concerned about the bad times which afflict the general public?” The man answered: “Does my food belong to them then? I eat only what the Almighty has destined for me.” While they were speaking a sister of Rava arrived, whom he had not seen for thirteen years, and she brought with her a stuffed bird and old wine. Rava turned to the poor man and said: “I have been given this because of you; come then and eat with me.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ס״ז ב׳.</span></i>
It is related that thieves dug their way into Rava’s stable and stole some sheep. The loot was later recovered and Rava refused to accept them because, since the thieves had accomplished their theft at the risk of their lives, the property belonged to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ע״ב א׳.</span></i> There are dozens of legends about Rava. For instance it is said that Rava would be greeted from Heaven every year on the eve of Yom Kippur. He was therefore a little disappointed that Abayei would get such greetings every Friday. When Rava inquired the reason, he was told to be satisfied to be able to protect a whole city with his merit.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית כ״ב א׳.</span></i>
The old queen Ifra Hurmiz, the mother of king Sapor the Second, felt particular affection for Rava. As we said, king Sapor II was bad to the Jews. His mother, Ifra Hurmiz, would often stop him from proclaiming some evil against the Jews because of her affection for Rava. Rava once had a Jew flogged for marrying an Aramitess. The victim died of his wounds. On hearing this the king wanted to punish Rava severely. The old queen said to him, “I pray you do not get into a fight with the Jews because whatever these people want, their God does for them.” “What, for instance, can their God do for them?” the king asked his mother with a skeptical smile upon his lips. “For instance, he gives them rain whenever they ask for it.” “Then let this Rava bring it about that now, suddenly in the month of Tammuz, there be rainfall, and I will remit his punishment,” said the king. So Rava stood up to pray for rain and after a short pleading with the Lord there was a violent rainfall which extended from Mechoza to the Tigris.<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית כ״ב ב׳.</span></i> On another occasion it is related that the queen Ifra Hurmiz sent four hundred golden armlets to Rav Ami who did not wish to accept her gift. Rava did accept this donation and divided it among the poor Gentiles.<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא י׳ ב׳.</span></i> It is related that the queen once sent Rava a sacrifice to be offered up in the name of the Jewish God.<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">זבחים קט״ז ב׳.</span></i>
The question of how long and when Rava lived is very complicated. According to Rashi, Rava lived only forty years.<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה י״ט ב׳.</span></i> There is a place in the Talmud which says that Rava was born on the day when Rav Judah bar Ezekiel died. But the “Chronicle of Rav Shrira Gaon” says that Rava was born in the year 352 C. E. which contradicts the place cited from the Talmud, for if it is true, then Rava would have been born not on the day of Rav Judah bar Ezekiel’s death but thirteen years later. Another theory is that of Maimonides who amends the Talmudical source to read that Rava was born <i>before</i> the death of Rav Judah. The Talmud also mentions once that Rava said something to Rav Judah.<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא צ״ז א׳.</span></i> On another occasion he quoted something in Rav Judah’s name.<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קכ״ט א׳.</span></i> Since Rava was head of the academy in Mechoza for fourteen years, there are some who estimate his life at 74 years.
We should note that during the time of Rava’s life the greatest worry of the Babylonian scholars was to determine the beginning of a new month and the holidays since they always had to wait for the decision of the High Court in Palestine. Then Hillel the Second, the Nasi of Palestine, wished to introduce a radical change in the manner of determining the Jewish calendar. Times were such as made it a risk of life to send out messengers with the news of the observation of the new moon and the ratification of the new month by the High Court, even within Palestine itself. We can imagine what dangers were involved in sending messengers to Babylon. At that time Rav Huna bar Abin gave Rava the system of the leap years. The scholars also possessed the system of leap years composed by Samuel Yarchinai. Later Hillel II set up the Jewish calendar in such a way that anyone could figure out the beginnings of the months and the dates of the holidays by himself. It was provided however that even though the Babylonians would be able to determine the months by themselves they should nevertheless continue to observe the second day of the holidays as they did previously before they had correct calendars. Rava was very strict in this matter with himself, more even than with others and he used to observe “Yom Kippur” two days, for he thought that perhaps the High Court in Palestine had set the day of Yom Kippur one day later than he had done himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">28)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה כ״א א׳.</span></i>

Rav Nachman bar Isaac

T<small>OWARDS THE END</small> of the third century of the Christian era the persecution of the Jews in Palestine assumed a terrible form and the academies disappeared entirely. Learning continued to flourish in Babylon, however, although it lost its former intensity. After Rava died nobody could be found who was learned enough to fill his place. The academy in Mechoza, which he had headed, disintegrated and the fame of Pumbeditha grew again. But even Pumbeditha was not as brilliant as previously. At the same time a new center of Jewish life and learning was established in the city of Narash (Nares). Then Rav Nachman bar Isaac was chosen as head of the academy in Pumbeditha.<sup class="footnote-marker">*)</sup><i class="footnote">We must note here that occasionally sayings have been quoted in the Talmud in the name of Rav Nachman bar Isaac and these have been confused with those of Rav Nachman bar Jacob.</i>
Rav Nachman bar Isaac was born about 280 C. E. and died 356 C. E. This was the time when the Babylonian “Amoraim” began to write down their Talmudic teachings. The “Mishnahs” of Rabbi Judah Hanasi as well as the “Boraithas” of Rabbi Chiya and Rabbi Oshaya had long been written down. Similarly the Jerusalem Talmud circulated among the scholars in written form even if not complete. Since they were afraid that the teachings of the Babylonian “Amoraim” might be lost, every scholar wrote down for his own use what he remembered of what his predecessors had taught. Rav Nachman bar Isaac had a great part in the written composition of these teachings. Therefore he used to say of himself: “I am not learned nor skilled in interpretation, so that I might express my own opinion. I never say anything on the authority of one man either, because whatever I say I heard in studying in the academy and I always arranged what I heard to meet the approval of my teachers”.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים ק״ה ב׳.</span></i>
Rav Nachman was held in high esteem by his contemporaries for his far-renowned piety and because he was a man of courage and did not fear even the Exilarch. It is related that when he was sitting with Rava, a member of the Exilarch’s family was carried by in a golden sedan-chair, sitting wrapped in a green mantle. Rava hastened to greet the person and Rav Nachman bar Isaac did not stir from his place saying: “Rava may need him, but I do not need him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ל״א ב׳.</span></i>
As a youth Rav Nachman bar Isaac studied with Rav Nachman bar Jacob. When Rava sat in the same school, Rav Nachman bar Isaac sat one row behind Rava.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין מ״ג ב׳.</span></i> Later Rav Nachman bar Isaac studied under Rav Chisda.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה ס״ג א׳.</span></i> And while Rav Joseph bar Chiya was still alive and Rava conducted his own school in Mechoza, Rav Nachman bar Isaac was his <span dir="rtl">״ראש כלה״</span> (the chief of the lecturers.)<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא כ״ב א׳.</span></i> Even at that time he was famous for his piety. Abayei said he was very scrupulous in his religious conduct.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ל״ז ב׳.</span></i>
Even though Rav Nachman bar Isaac was Rava’s <span dir="rtl">ראש כלה</span> Rava did not treat him with much respect when he asked a question which did not please Rava. On such an ocassion Rava said: “We will have to wait for the prophet Elijah to settle that question for us.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ל״ה ב׳.</span></i> On another occasion Rav Nachman tried to reply to some ruling of Rava by changing the interpretation of a Boraitha, and Rava grew very angry with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא פ״ז א׳.</span></i>
Rav Nachman used to call himself “a whole man, son of a half.” Rashi explains that this was because his father was not an ordained scholar. Other commentators say that this was because Rav Nachman was a wealthy man and his father was not.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית כ״א ב׳.</span></i> It is said that Rav Nachman’s mother always tried to lead her son in the paths of the righteous and when astrologers once told her that her son was destined to become a thief, she never allowed him to go into the street with a bare head, saying, “Cover your head so that you may fear God. You should also pray for his mercy so that evil impulses may not overcome you.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קנ״ז ב׳.</span></i>

Rav Papa

R<small>AV</small> P<small>APA WAS</small> about twenty years younger than Rav Nachman bar Isaac, but a more prominent figure. He was a student of Abayei in Pumbeditha and he remained there studying with Rava until the latter died.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין נ״א א׳, פּסחים קי״א ב׳.</span></i> Rav Papa was born about 300 C. E. and died 375 C. E. In his youth it appears that Rav Papa was a poor man. Later he began to make beer out of dates and became very rich.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות מ״ד ב׳, מנחות ע״א א׳.</span></i> He also dealt in poppy-seeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ע״ג א׳.</span></i>
Rav Papa carried on his business affairs in partnership with Rav Huna the son of Rav Joshua, and the friendship of these two scholars was so great that they never parted from each other all their life, neither at home nor on journeys.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות נ״ח א׳, שבת קל״ו א׳, יבמות פ״ח א׳.</span></i> And when Rav Papa later became head of the academy, Rav Huna the son of Rav Joshua was his <span dir="rtl">״ראש כלה״</span> <span dir="ltr"><sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות נ״ו א׳.</span></i></span>
After Rava died, Rav Nachman bar Isaac became the head of the academy in Pumbeditha and Rav Papa conducted his own school in Nares. Almost all the scholars in Mechoza went there and when they would get up after studying, their number would reach over two hundred.<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ק״ו א׳.</span></i>
It is said that Rav Papa was more scrupulous than the law required in his everyday conduct. Once he bought a field from a man who needed the money to buy an ox. Later this seller no longer needed the money and he regretted the bargain. Rav Papa returned his field without any difficulty even though legally he did not have to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות צ״ז א׳.</span></i> For such acts Rav Papa’s good name was known to all the people and even Samaritans who did not ordinarily have any confidence in Jewish scholars also came visiting to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא ס״ט א׳.</span></i> Very different was Rav Papa’s attitude to the pagans, whom he did not trust. It is said that he once went to collect a debt from an Aramitess. She invited him to sit down upon the bed. He would not sit down until he had examined the bed to see whether there were not something about it that would enable her to fix up a false charge against him and as the story goes he did indeed find a dead child in the bed.<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ח׳ ב׳.</span></i>
We should add that Rav Papa was a warden of charity in his city and as such, in the conditions of that time, it was impossible to act to everybody’s satisfaction.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא ט׳ א׳.</span></i> It is, in fact, related that Rav Papa once slipped on his step and almost fell. He said: “If I had fallen I should have suffered the punishment prescribed for a profaner of the Sabbath without having deserved it.” Said Chiya bar Rav Medafti to this: “It may be that you deserved it because a poor man came to you and you did not provide for him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא י׳ א׳.</span></i>
Rav Papa was also known as a great eater, who consumed at least four times as much as an ordinary man.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים פ״ט ב׳.</span></i> Although Rav Papa was the head of an academy and a very prominent scholar, he had a pupil named Rav Shimi bar Ashi who used to catch Rav Papa with such questions that they humiliated Rav Papa because he was unable to answer them. He therefore prayed to God to be delivered from Shimi’s questions.<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תענית ט׳ ב׳.</span></i> Rav Papa and his above-mentioned friend, Rav Huna the son of Rav Joshua, once had a trial with several merchants who complained against the two of them to Rava.

The laws and proverbs of Rav Papa number hundreds.

Rav Huna the Son of Rav Joshua

A<small>S WE HAVE WRITTEN ABOVE</small>, Rav Huna, son of Rav Joshua, was a friend of Rav Papa. They were in business together and they were so friendly that they were never apart whether at home or on a journey. When they were young they both studied under Abayei and Rava, and when Rava was still alive they both conducted a school in Nares, where they were both judges. Even though Rav Huna is always mentioned with his father’s name and his father is given the title of Rav, we do not know who and what Rav Huna’s father was.
It is related that when Rav Papa and Rav Huna, the son of Rav Joshua, once went somewhere with Abayei, Rav Papa walked on his right side and Rav Huna walked on his left side. Suddenly there sprang up a violent wind from the left side and Abayei commanded Rav Papa to walk on his left side and Rav Huna on the right.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים קי״א ב׳.</span></i>
As we have said, Rav Nachman bar Isaac was the head of the academy in Nares and his friend, Rav Huna, the son of Rav Joshua, became the <span dir="rtl">״ראש כלה״</span> (chief of the lectures); but even though Rav Papa was the head of the academy and Rav Huna only held the title “Rosh Kalah”, they were both equal in their dignity. They also made all decisions on religious and social affairs conjointly, because what one of them said the other always agreed to. It seems that Rav Huna did not have any students of his own. All the students in the academy of Nares were considered the students of Rav Papa. Whenever they quoted a saying, it was quoted in Rav Papa’s name and yet nowhere is there any evidence that Rav Huna, the son of Rav Joshua, was jealous about this. Only one student named Rav Jacob from N’har P’kud once quoted a law in the name of Rav Huna, the son of Rav Joshua.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ס״ט א׳.</span></i>
As dependent as they were on each other, their friendship nevertheless was without sentimentality. It is related that once when Rav Huna was sick, Rav Papa came to see him and thought that he was near to death. Without a sign of grief he ordered them to prepare shrouds. And then later when Rav Huna got better, confounding their expectations, Rav Papa did not show the least sign of pleasure that his friend had remained alive, but he simply wanted to know what Rav Huna had heard and seen when he lay so near death.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ראש השנה י״ז א׳.</span></i>
It is clear from Rav Huna’s Talmudical sayings that he was an expert in medicine.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה י״ב ב׳.</span></i> Of his remarks only this has remained: “May I be aided by the fact that I never went four paces with a bare head.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ח ב׳.</span></i>

Rav Chama of Nehardea

T<small>HIS</small> R<small>AV</small> C<small>HAMA OF</small> N<small>EHARDEA</small>, who is usually called just Rav Chama, was fortunate enough to have been the student of Rav Chisda.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נזיר כ׳ א׳.</span></i> It is possible that after Rav Chisda’s death he studied under Rava.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות פ״ו א׳.</span></i> It is not known, however, exactly where he had his academy, in Pumbeditha or in Nehardea. He was called “Rav Chama of Nehardea.” But it may be that he was named so simply because he was born there, although his academy was in Pumbeditha. We are certain only that he was the head of the academy for 21 years, from 356 to 377 C. E.
It is said that in the time when Rav Papa was the head of the academy in Nares and there was no academy in the whole of Palestine, king Sapor II of Persia once asked Rav Chama whether the burial of the dead was simply a folk-custom among the Jews or if it was a commandment of the Bible. The reason for this question was that the Persians, who worshipped fire, used to cremate their dead. King Sapor was not pleased with the Jewish custom of burial and he wished to order the Jews to burn their dead as the Persians did. Rav Chama of Nehardea was silent and did not answer the king’s question. At the moment, it seems, he did not know what to answer. Rav Acha bar Jacob heard of this and said: “The world has been handed over into the hands of fools who do not know that burial of the dead is a commandment of the Bible and when they are asked they forget the verse which says expressly, ‘for thou shalt bury him on that day.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין מ״ו ב׳.</span></i>
In Rav Chama’s times a great change in the government of the Roman Empire took place, which had a great influence upon the history of the Jews in Babylonia. Emperor Flavius Claudius Julianus, or as history calls him Julian the Apostate, because he denied the Christian religion, was educated in the ideas of the Greek philosophers and his teachers inculcated a love for the Greek idols. He abjured the Christian faith, which was the state religion of the Roman Empire already and attempted to reestablish the ancient Greek idolatry in its place.
For a long time the Emperor Constantius had suspected that he had his eye upon the position of Roman Emperor. At first he drove him into exile, and later he made him his assistant in ruling, and after a successful attack upon the Germans who had fallen upon the northern districts of the Roman Empire, Julian had himself proclaimed Emperor by his soldiers. Hearing this the Emperor Constantius went out to attack the usurper with a great army. But Constantius died on the way. With this there was no longer any obstacle to Julian’s climb to the throne. Immediately he recognized the old Greek religion and had himself chosen as <i>“Pontifex maximus”.</i>
He did not persecute the Christians, he simply took away from them those privileges which earlier Emperors had given them. In addition it is said that he lived simply, without luxury and superfluity. His philosophy taught him that the only task of a ruler was to extend his protection to all his subjects without regard to religion and he wished to apply his maxims to the rule of his land. Julian always manifested a particular interest in the condition of the Jews in the Roman Empire. Since Emperor Alexander Severus, the friend of Rabbi Judah N’siah II, there was no emperor of the Romans who took as much interest in the Jews as Julian. In his youth he read the writings of the Bible, and learned to respect the wisdom of the Jews; and after he became the Emperor of the Romans, he declared publicly that he regretted all the evil that his predecessors had done to the Jews. And since he undertook to revive the ancient Greek idolatry, he thought a great deal about sacrifices. He therefore was much taken with the idea of rebuilding the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, where God would be served with sacrifices.
Many believe that Julian’s kindness had no more than political motives. They think that since he intended to destroy the Persian control over Babylonia and he began warfare against king Sapor, he wished to win over the Jews, for he knew that the Jews of Babylonia had great influence in politics, and therefore he made the announcement that he wished to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem.
Julian did not content himself with a simple promise to build a Temple in Jerusalem, for in spite of having his hands full preparing the war against the Persians he set about the work of rebuilding the Temple in full earnest and appointed a special official, Alifius of Antioch, who had previously been the Roman governor of Britain. He instructed him also not to spare any money in building the Temple but to finish it quickly. At the same time he sent an imperial command to the governors of Syria and Palestine to support Alifius in his work and supply him with all necessaries.
All the materials were ready in Jerusalem. Great camps of workers were clearing away the ruins which had accumulated on the site of the Temple in the three centuries since its destruction. When they had cleared away the wreckage, the gases suddenly exploded and many workers were killed. This was regarded as a sign from Heaven that God did not wish the Jewish Temple to be rebuilt. Thus the history of Emperor Hadrian’s times repeated itself, for Emperor Hadrian too wanted to have the Temple rebuilt and the work was interrupted by an explosion of gases while the debris was being removed. It was said then that the Almighty did not wish to allow His Temple to be rebuilt by the same people who had destroyed it.
It is noteworthy that the Jews were not enthusiastic about the project. In the Jewish books of the time it is not even mentioned. Only Christian chronicles relate that the Jews sent gold and silver from all corners of the earth for the construction of their Temple. It is possible that previous experience of failure in revolutions against the Romans discouraged the Jews from any adventure with them, lest it fail and they have to pay dearly for its failure. In any case, before the Jews had a chance to study the matter it was too late, because Emperor Julian ruled no more than twenty months, and after twenty months of his rule he died in the war against the Persians in 363 C. E. at the age of thirty-two.
In his war against the Persians Julian wished to break king Sapor’s might in Babylonia. His dream was that the Roman eagle should spread his wings over the Tigris. King Sapor wanted not merely to maintain his rule over the land of Babylonia but to drive the Romans out of Asia entirely. Between these two giants the small people of Israel stood as between two fires. The end of this conflict of the Titans was not good for the Jews, both as to the attitude of king Sapor and as to the attitude of Julian’s successors.

Rav Sheshet

W<small>HEN</small> P<small>APA BAR</small> N<small>ETZER</small> destroyed Nehardea such famous scholars as Rav Nachman bar Jacob, Raban bar Avahu and Rav Joseph bar Chama had to flee. Among those who fled was also Rav Sheshet who did not become the head of the academy in his new residence and not even the judge; even though he conducted his own school and many of the most prominent “Amoraim” of that time were his students. All those scholars who fled from Nehardea dwelt in Mechoza, in Pumbeditha or in some other city near the Tigris, where new centers of Jewish life sprang up at the time. Rav Sheshet settled in Shilhi (Fhoum al Selhi).
In his youth Rav Sheshet was among the pupils of Rav Huna, when he occupied the seat of Rav (Aba Arecha) in Sura.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ס״ט א׳.</span></i> Later Rav Sheshet sat in Rav Chisda’s school and often disagreed with him about various problems of law. His diligence in study was so great that even in the midst of prayer he did not cease studying.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות ה׳ א׳.</span></i> He was blind and his memory was so strong that he knew not only the whole Mishnah by heart, but all the “Boraitoth” and “Toseftoth”. Many of the scholars said about him therefore that he was a man as hard as iron.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מנחות צ״ה ב׳.</span></i>
Rav Sheshet was also a pupil of Rav Jeremiah bar Aba, who was a student and a friend of Rav.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין י״ב א׳, מנחות ל״ט א׳.</span></i> But he did not always show the proper respect for Rav’s opinions and when he did not like them, he dared to say: “Rav could have said such a thing only when he was sleepy or snoring.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות כ״ד ב׳.</span></i> On another occasion he said, “Rav’s words on this matter are like those of a Kuthite (meaning an “Ignoramus”).<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדה ס״ט א׳.</span></i>
If there was any difficulty in anything studied, all one had to do was to ask Rav Sheshet. When Rav Chisda once met Rav Sheshet he was afraid to speak to him of matters of scholarship, lest he be overshadowed.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין ס״ז א׳.</span></i> In addition he was very keen-witted. Rav Chama of Nehardea said that the verse “Wisdom is good with inheritance” referred to Rav Sheshet and meant that it is good to have wisdom and acuteness together with the inheritance of the Mishnah.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בכורות נ״ב ב׳.</span></i>
Nevertheless it sometimes happened that in spite of his great keenness and prodigious memory Rav Sheshet forgot something. When this happened once he asked his students: “When you ever catch me forgetting something, do not tell anyone about it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין י״א ב׳, ל״ט ב׳.</span></i>
It is evident that Rav Sheshet did not care for logic-chopping in contriving new laws or in deriving them out of old ones in a hair-splitting fashion. Once when there was a debate about the question of whether a prisoner should be considered as dead and his children permitted to receive their inheritance even though it is not certain that he had died, an attempt was made to derive this law from the verse “and I shall kill you and your children will be orphans and your wives widows.” It was remarked that if God wanted to kill anyone there was no need to add that his children would be orphans and his wives widows, since this was self-evident. Then what was the purpose of these words in the verse? We must infer therefore that the verse intimates that the widow of the dead man would desire to remarry and would not be allowed to do so and his children would desire to inherit his property and they would not be allowed to do so. This interpretation was told to Rav Sheshet by one of his students as an answer to the problem, and Rav Sheshet said to him: “I see that you are one of those people from Pumbeditha who can drive an elephant through the eye of a needle.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא ל״ה ב׳.</span></i>
Rav Sheshet himself always supported his views by a quotation from the Mishnah.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ל״ה א׳, זבחים צ״ו ב׳.</span></i> When he studied he was interested in finding the origin of every law, whether it came from the Mishnah or from the Boraitha.<sup class="footnote-marker">12)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">כתובות ס״ח א׳.</span></i> He also had a man with him who was engaged in composing the “Boraithoth.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין פ״ו א׳, הוריות ט׳ א׳.</span></i>
Here we may mention that just as Rav Nachman bar Jacob’s decisions in matters of money were considered authoritative, so were Rav Sheshet’s decisions in matters of permitted and prohibited actions.
It is not known who and what Rav Sheshet’s father was. And since he once said himself: “I am no scholar and I am not the son of a scholar,” many historians believe that Rav Sheshet’s father was not a scholar. But this cannot be proved by this statement, for he says that he too was not a scholar.<sup class="footnote-marker">14)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">עבודה זרה ב׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Rav Sheshet was blind and a story is related about this. Once the people of his town went to welcome the king and Rav Sheshet went along. A certain wag wanted to fool him. Whenever a party of the king’s company went by that wag said to him: “Here comes the king!” But Rav Sheshet was not fooled. When at last it grew quiet and the wag said nothing, Rav Sheshet understood that the king had really come. And when the wag later asked him how he knew when the king was coming even though he was blind, Rav Sheshet explained that it was in the same way that the prophet Elijah recognized the presence of God’s Majesty when He came to him in the cave where he was hiding from the wrath of Ahab and Jezebel.<sup class="footnote-marker">15)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות נ״ח א׳.</span></i>
We may assume that Rav Sheshet was not born blind. How he went blind is explained in the interpretations of the elderly Talmudists who apparently had it from earlier generations. It seems that since Rav (Aba Arecha) never lifted his eyes from the ground so that he would not see any impure thing. Rav Sheshet and Rav Joseph bar Chama wanted to imitate him and they strained their eyesight by not lifting their glances from the earth until they grew blind.
There are many who seek to prove that Rav Sheshet was not born blind by the fact that he is said once to have seen a snake in a dream and killed it.<sup class="footnote-marker">16)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות נ״ז ב׳.</span></i> For if he had been blind from birth, he would not have had any conception of the appearance of a snake and he would not have been able to dream about it. On another occasion it is related that his mother came into his school once to pray for a student of his named Ahadboy bar Ami who had been stricken dumb because he had taken a notion to mock at Rav Sheshet. When Rav Sheshet refused to listen to his mother’s pleas, she cried out: “See the breast which you suckled.” And if he had been born blind she would not have used the word “see.”<sup class="footnote-marker">17)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא ט׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Rav Sheshet did not make his living from scholarship but from trade. It is related that he dealt in clothes which he used to sell on credit.<sup class="footnote-marker">18)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין י״ד ב׳.</span></i> He also used to carry burdens on his shoulders for pay and he would say: “Work is a great thing because it warms people up.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ס״ז ב׳.</span></i>
Rav Sheshet was a delicate soul who ate meagrely and had a weak stomach. If he ate something in the morning, he could not eat at night. Therefore he fasted on the Eve of Passover so that he could eat the matzoth with appetite at night.<sup class="footnote-marker">20)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים ק״ח א׳.</span></i> Nevertheless his spirit was as hard as steel.<sup class="footnote-marker">21)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מנחות צ״ה ב׳.</span></i> It is related that Rav Sheshet had continual conflicts with the Exilarch and his household. It seems that the people of the Exilarch’s house would treat the scholars with contempt and they were careless in the observance of the commandments also. When Rav Sheshet once sent one of his people, Rav Gada, to set up the “Eruv” at the Exilarch’s house he was arrested there.<sup class="footnote-marker">22)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין י״א ב׳.</span></i>
The Exilarch often invited Rav Sheshet to eat with him, but Rav Sheshet always excused himself with one alibi or another. Once he claimed that the servants of the Exilarch served meat that was torn from the living flesh.<sup class="footnote-marker">23)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ס״ח א׳.</span></i> Another time Rav Nachman bar Jacob and Rav Chisda were at the Exilarch’s table on the second day of the holiday and they were served a stag which was caught on the first day of the holiday and slaughtered on the second. Rav Nachman and Rav Chisda ate the deer’s meat but Rav Sheshet refused.<sup class="footnote-marker">24)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין ל״ט ב׳.</span></i>
The cause of Rav Sheshet’s conflict with the Exilarch is not known. It may be that Rav Sheshet felt insulted because the Exilarch once told him: “Although you are all very famous and venerable Rabbis, the Persians have better manners at the table.”<sup class="footnote-marker">25)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות מ״ו ב׳.</span></i>
Rav Sheshet was not fortunate enough to have any sons to whom to hand on his learning. When he became a widower he was asked why he didn’t marry a second time and have a son, he answered that his daughter’s children were as dear to him as though they were his own.<sup class="footnote-marker">26)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יבמות ס״ב בי.</span></i>
When Rav Sheshet was about to die it is said that the Angel of Death met him on the street and tried to take away his soul. So he said to him: “You want to kill me on the street like a steer? If you want to take my soul come into my house.”<sup class="footnote-marker">27)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ח א׳.</span></i>

Rav Ashi, the Compiler of the Babylonian Talmud

A<small>FTER THE DEATH</small> of king Sapor the Second, the condition of the Jews in Babylonia was greatly improved. The successors of this king were just to all the peoples of their realm and they treated the Jews with particular kindness. They held Jewish learning in great esteem and if only the Jews paid their royal taxes in time, they were allowed to maintain their academies and they were not disturbed in their religion.
Then there arose a man who collected all the lore of the Mishnah and the interpretations made by the scholars of Babylonia and Palestine up to that time. The name of this man was Rav Ashi and the people of his time gave him the title “Rabbana”, our Rabbi, meaning that he was not only a teacher like other teachers with pupils, but he was really the teacher of the whole generation. Others would say that he was a “Sinai and uprooter of hills” filled with Torah like the mountain of Sinai and at the same time a subtle thinker who tore up the hills with his dialectic.
Rav Ashi was born about 352 and died in the year 427 C. E. The year of his birth is not certain for it is possible that he was born earlier and lived longer than is generally supposed. When he was still very young — some say that he was hardly 14 years of age — he had already distinguished himself by his keen mind, deep insight and personal virtues. He was then chosen head of the academy at Matha Mechasia near Sura<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">* Rav Sherira Gaon, who lived in Babylonia all his life and who wrote the history of its academies, says that Sura is the same as Matha Mechasia, although other historians cite proof that they were two separate places. They remark however that the two cities were close together. Today of course it is hard to decide this question. Neither of the cities exists any longer and their sites are not even known. It is notable however that wherever the name of Rav Ashi is mentioned in the Talmud, it is always in connection with the name of Matha Mechasia instead of Sura.</i> which had been waste and deserted for a long time.
The magnetic personality of Rav Ashi raised the prestige of his academy. All the scholars of his time were respectful when they heard his words, in a way that had not been paralleled since the death of Rava. People would say that “since the time of Rabbi Judah Hanasi and Rav Ashi there was no one who united wealth with Torah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין נ״ט א׳, סנהדרין ל״ו א׳.</span></i> Raised in wealth, Rav Ashi continued wealthy all his life and owned many fields and forests. He would allow his wool to be sold for the uses of idol-worship without regard for the prohibition which forbade this.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">נדרים ס״ב ב׳.</span></i> But this cannot be considered as evidence of his tolerance of the customs of the pagans, for his expressed opinions were that the pagans in his neighborhood were a worthless crew. Thus he could never understand the fact that the pagans in Matha Mechasia did not recognize the worth of the Torah and become converts to Judaism even though they had the opportunity of seeing the splendor with which it endows its scholars twice a year.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות י״ז ב׳.</span></i>
No details of Rav Ashi’s youth are known, nor is the name of his father known. It seems that he studied under the most prominent students of Abayei and Rava. It is likely also that he was born in Matha Mechasia and tried to aid his city in everything he could. In earlier times there was a synagogue there which lay in ruins in his day because of its age. Rav Ashi had it rebuilt and stood there each day himself to see that the workmen did not loaf in their work. He had a bed set up for him there until the building was finished.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא בתרא ג׳ ב׳.</span></i> Then he built a splendid school so that there would be room for his students as well as for the auditors who came to hear his lectures in the “lecture months” of Adar and Elul of every year. He never allowed the people of Matha Mechasia to build their roofs higher than the roof of the synagogue or the academy, because he believed in an old saying of Rav (Aba Arecha) that a city whose dwelling houses are taller than its synagogues or its academies was doomed to destruction. He said therefore that this rule of his saved Matha Mechasia from destruction.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת י״א א׳.</span></i>
According to many historians Rav Ashi occupied the post of head of the academy in Matha Mechasia all of sixty years. At the same time the academy at Nehardea regained some of its former splendor, under its head Amemar. The same thing took place at Pumbeditha. There were eight heads there during Rav Ashi’s days. But not a single one of the “Amoraim” reached the heights of Rav Ashi who was listened to by everyone and supported in his efforts to regulate religious life. Even the two Exilarchs of that time (Rav Cahana and Mar Zutra) who were recognized scholars and also rulers of the country always looked up to Rav Ashi and followed his words.
There was a custom in those days that the Exilarch used to come for a visit once a year to those cities where the best academies of Babylonia were in order to receive the greetings of the Jewish communities. Even though there were several academies of importance in Rav Ashi’s time, the Exilarch came only to Sura which was near Matha Mechasia. Usually this would take place on the Saturday during which the chapter <i>“Lech-l’cha”</i> was read, in the beginning of the month Marcheshvan. This was the festival Sabbath in honor of the Exilarch who would then make a feast in honor of the head of the academy. In Sura or in Matha Mechasia also the “assemblies” would convene at which the Exilarch made his reports concerning the political situation. Although the Exilarch lived in a different city, he used to call these assemblies to Sura during Rav Ashi’s time. The city Matha Mechasia, therefore, became the capital of Jewish life in Babylonia to which almost all the Jews of the land would assemble during the “lecture months” (Elul and Adar) when the head of the academy would lecture about the laws of the holidays; as well as upon a holiday sabbath when the people came to greet the Exilarch, or when they gathered for a general assembly.
Since Rav Ashi united all the virtues, surpassing all the men of his times, he also had the ability to undertake the great task of compiling and arranging all the legal decisions and religious interpretations of the Mishnahs, as well as the Boraithoth and Tosefthoth, in one great work out of which the Babylonian Talmud later developed. One reason for the collection of this work was probably the desire to facilitate the preservation of all this religious and legal material which kept on growing from generation to generation in order to perpetuate its memory among men and to maintain it alive in their hearts. After many of those interpretations and decisions had been forgotten, as Rav Ashi complained, and the memory of people seemed to be growing weaker, he said that “if the hearts of former generations were as wide as the gates of a palace, our hearts are as narrow and insignificant as the eye of a needle.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין נ״ט א׳.</span></i> Since the time of Rav (Aba Arecha) the material of scholarship had increased so much that it surpassed the capacity of human memory. Rav Ashi collected all this material and had it written down so that it would not be forgotten.
It seems that Rav Ashi occupied the seat of the head of the academy in Matha Mechasia for sixty years, and he spent all this time in collecting all the interpretations of the Talmud which had accumulated in the various academies. He was very careful and wrote things into his collection only after long scrutiny. In the “lecture months” of each year when all of Rav Ashi’s students would assemble from all corners of Babylonia, he would assign a given topic for study or a section of that topic to be discussed by the scholars and the students. In this way the whole of the Mishnah and the Talmud were divided into sixty parts (<span dir="rtl">מסכתות</span>). Thus Rav Ashi completed the division of the Mishnah, the great work of Rabbi Judah Hanasi 200 years back. This was a very difficult task, not to be compared with the editing of the Mishnah, which contained short, simple statements of the laws of the Torah, as they were interpreted at that time. Incidental matters and details were collected separately in the “Boraithoth”. The “Gemara”, however, contains everything and excludes nothing which has the slightest connection with the topic under discussion.
The Babylonian Talmud became the cornerstone of the further development of the Jewish people. Rav Ashi did not finish this immense work. He was the one who felt that the time had at last come to assemble all the material. Each academy had had its own system of interpreting the Mishnah, which was taught at that academy. The urge to find new interpretations of the commandments was still alive. Rav Ashi could not restrain himself merely to collecting and arranging the matter, because he was called upon to decide all sorts of differences of opinion at the same time and to resolve doubts and supply explanations where they were needed.
For almost the whole of the time that Rav Ashi was head of the academy in Matha Mechasia the Persian king Yezdigerd the Second ruled the land. His religious conduct was displeasing to the Persian priests and they called him “the sinner.” He was criticized particularly for his behavior towards the Jews, whom he protected from harm so long as he ruled. The Babylonian academies, three in number, flourished under his protection. Jews were invited to all the court celebrations, and the heads of the three academies, Rav Ashi of Matha Mechasia and Sura, Mar Zutra of Pumbeditha, and Amemar of Nehardea, had to represent the Jews among the prominent leaders of the realm who were present at all the feasts in the king’s house.
King Yezidgerd lavished special honors upon the Exilarch of the time, Rav Huna bar Nathan. It is related that the Exilarch once appeared before the king wearing a girdle under his sleeves after the fashion of ordinary people. The king lowered his girdle to his loins and said: “You Jews are the priests of God Almighty and should wear your girdles after the fashion of our priests.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">זבחים י״ט א׳.</span></i>
In those days finally arrived the historic day of reckoning for the Roman Empire. On all sides Rome was pounded by different enemies. Internal conflict and outer war united for the same purpose, and any clear-eyed person could see that the days of the Roman Empire were numbered. There were many Jews who saw these political complications as signs of the advent of the Messiah. At the same time the “Book of the Jubilees” from the Apocrypha became known among the people in which all the historic occurrences of the world were reckoned according to the count of the jubilee years. It was found that this book stated that the world had only eighty-five jubilee-years for the count of its existence. They calculated that this meant that the year 439 C. E. would mark the end of the world, and since this year was rapidly approaching, they expected the near arrival of Messiah.
All these fantasies inflamed the imaginations of the people and they fell easy prey to all sorts of cranks. Such a movement was started in Crete in Rav Ashi’s days and the Jews there were deluded into following a crank. He was a semi-lunatic who called himself Moses. He promised his following to perform miracles like those Moses performed in leading the Jews out of Egypt. He would lead them through the Mediterranean Sea to Palestine and the sea would dry up under their feet. The Jews of Crete believed in him and abandoned their work and their property and followed their Messiah who would split open the sea for them like Moses of old. At last the day came when the new Moses had promised the great miracle to occur. Moses went ahead and all the Jews of Crete with their wives and children followed him to the shore of the sea. There the new Messiah stood at the crest of a cliff and ordered his followers to jump into the sea and it would split immediately. Following the precedent of Moses, for whom Nachshon ben Aminadav sprang into the sea and it opened up when he was standing neck-deep, all the followers of the new Moses sprang into the sea. All but a small remnant were drowned. Sailors who were out on the sea in small boats saved those who survived.
Meanwhile the Roman Empire came nearer to its doom with every passing day. The Romans were fanatical Christians at the time, full of hatred for the Jews. One after another the academies in Palestine were shut down, and the love of learning was almost extinct there. At the same time the power of the Jewish “Nasi”, whose position had been the most brialliant light in the darkness of the Exile previously, was destroyed. After the “Nasi” Rabbi Hillel the Second, who introduced the regular calendar, there were three N’siim: Rabban Gamaliel V, Rabbi Jehudah N’siah III, and Rabban Gamaliel VI. But the position of Nasi was without practical importance. The government no longer supported the Nasi. It merely demanded that he squeeze the last penny out of the Jews for taxes, and in order to cover the expenses of his establishment, the Nasi had to send agents to all the communities of the Jewish Diaspora to collect charity.
Theodosius the Great was Emperor then and he always protected the Jews, even though the Christian priests always agitated against them and threatened that Theodosius’ soul would burn in Hell because he did not assist in the persecution of the Jews. Theodosius paid no attention but he issued a decree which permitted the Nasi to continue to excommunicate anyone whom he considered harmful to the Jewish community. He forbade anyone to interfere with the inner government of the Jews and in their internal quarrels. The justice of Emperor Theodosius for the Jews was best proven, when the Nasi Rabban Gamliel V complained that the Roman Consul Hesichius had robbed him of many valuable documents. Calling the Consul for a hearing, the Emperor found him guilty and sentenced him to death. Theodosius was hard put to it to soothe the fanatical hatred of the priests for the Jews. They were continually trying to disturb the Jews at their worship. Whenever the Jews would erect a synagogue, they were subjected to all sort of trouble, their synagogues were pilfered, sacred objects were stolen and fire would be set to the building.
The outstanding figures in this destructive mania were John Chrysostom of Antioch and Ambrosius of Milan in Italy. Chrysostom was enraged when he saw that many of the Christians were sympathetic to the Jews. Every Saturday and holiday certain Christians would come to the Jewish synagogue for religous inspiration. Especially aristocratic ladies were known to visit the synagogue regularly, fast on Yom Kippur and sit in a Succah. When Christians fell out between themselves they would often choose to go before a Jewish court because they knew that they would get justice there. This was something Chrysostom could not bear and he fought against with all his strength.
Meanwhile other occurrences enraged Chrysostom still further. In Rome the Christians burned a Jewish synagogue. The Emperor ordered the Senate to rebuild the synagogue at the expense of the Roman Christians. On another occasion the bishop of Kalinikat in northern Mesopotamia ordered his priests to tear down the Jewish synagogue. Theodosius not only ordered him to rebuild the synagogue at his own expense, but made him punish all those who took part in the destruction. On hearing this Chrysostom was fearfully angry and threatened the Emperor with the fiercest pains of Hell until he was forced to rescind the bishop’s punishment.
In order to put a stop to all these attacks upon the Jews, Theodosius issued a proclamation which declared that the Jewish religion had always been allowed in Rome and the Jews were always recognized as citizens. Then the Emperor ordered all his consuls to punish anyone who disturbed the peace of the Jewish religion or who destroyed their synagogues.
Wishing to secure the safety of his successors’ empire, Emperor Theodosius divided it into two parts: the western part of the Empire with the city of Rome as the capital divided from the eastern part with its capital in Byzantium. This arrangement did not secure the peace of the Empire, however, and the Jews had to suffer in both parts of the Empire. They knew, however, how to soften the wrath of their rulers by the use of coin. In this way it came about that the Emperor issued a proclamation that protected the Jews from attack, just as the Jewish Nasi was protected from insult. The Emperor’s proclamation ordered the rulers not to allow the mobs to attack Jewish synagogues. He also renewed the rule that the Jewish N’siim were exempt from taxes in each country just like Christian priests. In addition he ordered that disputes between Jews be settled in the Jewish court, and the Roman officials were to support the Jewish courts in the execution of their decisions.
In the time of Emperor Theodosius II (in Byzantium) Jewish gifts could accomplish very little. The Emperor prohibited the building of new synagogues and he denied the Jewish courts the right to judge disputes between Jews and Christians. In this Emperor’s time the office of Nasi was abolished. The last Nasi of the Jews was Rabban Gamaliel VI, the son of Rabbi Judah N’siah III. He was more honored in the royal court than all his predecessors. In all this esteem however, there was not the least hint of power. It is related that he received some titles for his great learning in medicine, especially for having found a remedy for a sick spleen.
He was in error, however, if he thought that he could accomplish anything for the good of his people. Thinking that he was not required to obey the letter of all the imperial commands, he built new synagogues and judged disputes between Jews and Christians. The result was that Theodosius revoked all his titles and took away all his importance as Nasi. This happened in 415 C. E. The Emperor left him only the title of Nasi without any power. Without leaving any children the line of N’siim in Palestine was broken after five centuries and fifteen generations, when he died in 426 C. E.
And these are the names of all the “N’siim”: Rabban Gamaliel the Old, Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel, Rabban Gamaliel of Javneh, Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel II, Rabbi Judah Hanasi, Rabban Simeon ben Rabbi Judah Hanasi. Rabbi Judah N’siah, Rabbi Gamaliel ben Rabbi Judah N’siah, Rabbi Judah N’siah II, Rabbi Gamaliel V, Rabbi Judah N’siah III, Rabbi Hillel (II), Rabbi Gamaliel ben Rabbi Hillel, Rabbi Judah N’siah IV, and Rabbi Gamaliel VI.

Tavyomi Mar Bar Rav Ashi

F<small>OR HUNDREDS OF YEARS</small> the Jews of Babylonia lived in peace and quiet and knew nothing of persecution. They made their living from agriculture and trade. And since they lacked for nothing and the government protected their lives, they were able to devote themselvs to learning and observe the commandments of the Torah. The Jews were especially well off under the rule of the Parthians who defeated the Chaldeans and conquered their land. But even later under the Persians only the early years were bad, when the Persians were still religious fanatics and had not learned to be tolerant to people of other faiths. Later the situation changed and the Jews entrenched themselves in complete security as a “nation within a nation.” The cities where the great academies were to be found, were purely Jewish cities and governed themselves. The Jews lived in Babylonia as though in their own state, which had only to pay taxes to the central government and had the right to protection from outside enemies in return.
Those good times suddenly changed, and the former difficulties with king Sapor the Second were made to seem like mere sport by the troubles which the Jews suffered later. Since the scholars decided that the government had resolved to destroy the Jewish people and its religion, they felt that the time had come finally to colect all the documents of Jewish tradition, and save them from oblivion and all mischances. The Babylonian Talmud was created which contained all the creations of the Jewish spirit and everything the Jews had thought from the last prophets to Rav Ashi and Ravina.
It is a revealing fact that about thirty years after the death of Rav Ashi the leaders of the academy in Matha Mechasia near Sura were merely nominal leaders, for their work made no impression upon the life of the Jews, and in Pumbeditha conditions were still worse. One of the most prominent among those heads of the academy was Rav Nachman bar Huna, a student of Rav Ashi’s. After his death they were about to choose for his successor a son of Rav Ashi by the name Tavyomi, who had long deserved to occupy that position. This son is known in the Talmud as “Mar bar Rav Ashi.” Various elements interfered with the choice of Tavyomi with their intrigues. Then another Amora, named Rav Acha Midifto, who was related to the Exilarch, was chosen as head of the academy in Matha Mechasia. While this was happening Mar bar Rav Ashi was away on a trip to Mechoza. The news hurt him very much for he had set his heart on filling his father’s post.
When it became known that Mar bar Rav Ashi had returned from his trip, the scholars in Matha Mechasia realized that they should have asked his opinion about the man whom they had chosen to fill the post that should rightly have been his. They sent two scholars to meet him and tell him whom they had chosen as head of the academy. Tavyomi kept the two scholars and would not let them depart. They sent two other scholars. Tavyomi kept them also. The same thing was repeated until Tavyomi had ten scholars with him. Then he answered their report of the election of a new head of the academy with a lecture which so enthralled them that they ended by begging him to become the head of their academy, and he accepted the post.
This happened in the year 456 C. E. In the same year the terrible persecutions of the Jews broke out, unparalleled in the previous history of Babylonia. The persecutions were carried out by a concerted campaign of slaughter and murder which aimed at the total extinction of the Jews.
Mar bar Rav Ashi was the greatest of the later “Amoraim” and his contemporaries were fully aware of his importance so that his opinions were law. Nevertheless he was unable to restore the academy in Sura to its former importance. He continued the work of his father in the compilation of the Talmud. He also gathered all the legal rulings of his father and cleared up some obscure points in his father’s teachings. Beyond this very little is known of him. Because of the troubles of that time there is no record of the accomplishments of a whole series of important scholars who lived then.
The Jews suffered particularly at that time from the hand of king Yezdigerd (Harmizdas) the Third who was a very evil person and bore a special hatred to the Jews. His first step was to prohibit the observance of the Sabbath. At the same time he shut down the academies.
There are various legends which purport to explain the reasons which caused this sudden wrath of the Persian kings against the Jews who had always been loyal and true to them. The true reason is simply religious fanaticism. Since the Persian priests had a strong desire to convert the Jews to their faith, they sought every opportunity for religious debates; in these contests the Jews did not spare the religious beliefs of the Persians and insulted them together with their idols. The priests were terribly enraged and began to persecute the Jews as enemies of their faith.
In one such debate between a Persian priest and the head of the academy of Nehardea, Amemar, the priest was determined to prove that the universe was ruled by two divinities, Ormuzd, who was the god of light and life, and Ahriman who was the god of darkness and destruction. Seeing that Amemar would not be convinced, he tried to argue on the analogy of the human body, the upper half of which belonged to Ormuzd because it is the seat of the understanding and all good sensations, and the lower half belonged to Ahriman, because the beastly part lies there. Amemar answered that the analogy with the human body would not hold, because a god like Ahriman should not have allowed the whole of human filth to be borne through the canals of his kingdom. Amemar said further that in the universe too there was no boundary between good and evil for they were both derived from the same God.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">סנהדרין ל״ט א׳.</span></i>

Ravina, the Final Compiler of the Babylonian Talmud

A<small>FTER THE DEATH OF KING</small> P<small>IRUZ</small> (495 C.E.) the persecutions against the Jews ceased for a while, and normal times such as Babylonia had enjoyed previously returned. The academies were reopened in Sura and Pumbeditha. The heads of these two rebuilt academies were appointed. The head of Sura was Ravina (Rav Avina) and a certain Rav Joseph, of whom very little is known, was chosen head of Pumbeditha.
We must note that a generation later there was another Ravina who was a brother’s son to this Ravina, who was active as an “Amora”, and according to the “Chronicle of Rav Shrira Gaon” his name was Rav Avina the son of Rav Huna. This Ravina was a student of his uncle and in order to make a distinction between them the scholars called him “Ravina the younger”.
It seems that Ravina was head of the academy in Sura not more than one year, from 499 to 500 C. E. In those days the Babylonian “Amoriam” saw only one purpose for their work and this was to finish the great work begun by Rav Ashi in compiling the Talmud. The contemporary persecutions were the cause for the decrease in the numbers of the students and the decline of the influence of the Torah upon the life of the Jews. In Palestine there had long ceased to be any academies and in Babylonia evil monarchs sought to bring about the same condition in their own land. The “Amoraim” understood that in order to save the spiritual treasures of the Jewish people, created by its scholars in the course of so many centuries they would have to hasten the completion of the Talmud which Rav Ashi had begun.
Rav Ashi and Ravina were the last to leave their stamp upon the development of the Jewish law.<sup class="footnote-marker">1)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא מציעא פ״ו א׳.</span></i> With these two the work of the “Amoraim” in Babylonia was finished. There were, to be sure, still two generations of Amoraim but these were simply people who had no original contribution to make to the development of the law and simply echoed the teachings of their predecessors.
When Ravina is mentioned he is usually coupled as a second after Rav Ashi, even though it seems that Ravina was the older of the two. He outlived Rav Ashi by a long time. Like all the scholars of his time he was considered a student under Rav Ashi, and he would listen to Rav Ashi’s words without ever contradicting him.<sup class="footnote-marker">2)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ברכות כ״ד ב׳.</span></i> It should therefore be mentioned that Rav Ashi treated Ravina not like a student but like a colleague and friend.<sup class="footnote-marker">3)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ערובין ס״ג א׳.</span></i>
He was born in Matha Mechasia near Sura and was an owner of fields and forests, and even though the time was one in which a person could easily grow rich from speculation, it was said of Ravina that he renounced any sort of profit that was not in harmony with his religious and moral principles. As an outstanding student of Rav, Ravina would often go from Matha Mechasia to Mechoza where Rava had his academy to listen to Rava’s interpretation of the Torah, or to ask some question concerning a matter of law. Ravina grew in learning before the eyes of Rava. And when the people of Mechoza once addressed an inquiry to Ravina, Rava permitted him to instruct them and to answer their questions according to his understanding. He did not wish to do this in Mechoza, however, for Rava was active there. Not being the head of any academy at the time he would travel through the large cities of Babylonia and wherever he would stop, he would set up the tent of the Torah and he would teach there even while Rava was still alive. There are therefore laws which are quoted in the names of both Rava and Ravina.<sup class="footnote-marker">4)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">קדושין ט׳ ב׳.</span></i>
Ravina would study day and night. The verses of the Bible served him as foundations of the law. Sacred and not to be tampered with was the text of the Mishnah for him. It was only with a Boraitha or a saying of some “Amora” that he would permit himself to make an emendation, even if it changed the meaning of the quotation.<sup class="footnote-marker">5)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת קי״ד א׳, קי״ט ב׳.</span></i> On another occasion he said: “since the beginning of that Boraitha contradicts the end, it is clear that there is a mistake somewhere and it has not been quoted in the form which it had the first time the teacher said it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">גטין ע״ג א׳.</span></i>
Ravina always tried to make the commandments easier to observe, whenever possible. He believed that the dignity of man was more important than the dignity of the commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">7)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מנחות ל״ז ב׳.</span></i> And the law almost always followed Ravina’s decision.<sup class="footnote-marker">8)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">פּסחים ע״ד ב׳, חולין צ״ג ב׳.</span></i>
Justice is the main thread in all of Ravina’s work, and the people called him “the Just.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מועד קטן כ״ה ב׳.</span></i> Like a righteous man he was active in charitable works and begged money from the rich to care for the needs of the poor. Rich ladies used to take off their jewelry and give it to him for the poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">10)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">בבא קמא קי״ט א׳.</span></i>
During the time that Rav Ashi was head of the academy at Matha Mechasia near Sura, prominent Babylonian Jews approached him with the idea that the time was ripe for the Babylonian Jews to set up a “Babylonian Talmud” just as the Palestinian Jews in a similar time had set up the “Jerusalem Talmud.” The government, they argued, was no longer as favorable to the Jews as formerly, study was suppressed and almost entirely prohibited. The behavior of the last two kings towards the Jews had proved how little the favors of monarchs could be depended upon, and how uncertain was Jewish existence. There was a danger therefore that if everything was not written down that had been created by the scholars after Rabbi Judah Hanasi, the learning of the Jews might be forgotten. They desired to collate everything that had been said since the edition of the Mishnah, to select and arrange it critically. All the scholars proposed to Rav Ashi the inclusion of their own words or of what they had had from their teachers and whatever met the approval of Rav Ashi was included in the canon of the “Gemara”.
Of the scholars who assisted Rav Ashi in his work, there is first of all Ravina, and besides him the following scholars: Rav Acha bar Rava, Rav Mordecai, Rav Hillel, Rav Acha bar Ivia, Rava Mibarnish, Rav Yemar, Rav G’vihah from Bei K’sil, Rabah Zuti, Rav Asi and Rav Aba from Palestine who told Rav Ashi all the customs of Palestine in the observance of the law.<sup class="footnote-marker">11)</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">שבת ק״ג ב׳, גטין ל״ד ב׳.</span></i>
It should be noted that the Palestinian scholars who came to Babylonia at the time were of great assistance in the collation of the “Babylonian Talmud”, contributing the finest and the best that was in the “Jerusalem Talmud”. Just as the “Amoraim” of Palestine had formerly included the sayings of the Babylonian scholars in their Talmud, so the Babylonians now included the wisdom of Palestine.
There was no system of arranging the sayings in the Talmud of Jerusalem. The Babylonian Jews, living in relatively secure circumstances, had a better chance to assemble, to debate and agree on the order of the work. Because of the unceasing persecutions, the Palestinian scholars never had the chance to arrange their Talmud patiently as it should have been arranged. Therefore the “Jerusalem Talmud” remained a fragmentary thing unsuited to be a “national work,” for much of it certainly was lost and the lost portion may have been the finest and the best. Only a small part of the Jerusalem Talmud was saved from oblivion by those Palestinian scholars who succeeded in escaping to Babylonia. It is therefore a great merit of those scholars who edited the Babylonian Talmud that they gave us all the conjectures in law that were in the Jerusalem Talmud. Further we must make note that a great part of the Babylonian Talmud, even a majority of the sayings included, came from Palestinian scholars.
It may be assumed also that the Jerusalem Talmud was well known in Babylonia and everything in it which fell in with the Babylonian laws was included in the Babylonian Talmud. Thus the Jew and the Talmud are a twin birth, and even if certain periods of Jewish history spent less time in the study of the Talmud, its ruling spirit was inherited by every period of Jewish history and strongly influenced their character. Various historical causes brought it about that the Babylonian Talmud and not the Jerusalem Talmud became the unchallenged ruler of Jewish life, and formed its every detail so that anyone who wanted to renounce it, renounced God’s covenant with His people.
