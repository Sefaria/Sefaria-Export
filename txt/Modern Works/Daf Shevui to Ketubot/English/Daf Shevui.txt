Daf Shevui to Ketubot

Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

Introduction<br>Ketubot, Daf Bet, Part 1 Introduction Ketuboth opens by discussing on which days of the week a virgin marries, and on which days of the week a widow (or divorcee) marries. Note that these customs have not been observed for a very long time, probably already from the time of the Talmud, and may not have even been observed in the times of the Mishnah itself.
Explanation<br> According to the mishnah a virgin is married on Wednesday so that if the husband wants to make a claim against her that she was not a virgin, he can come directly to the court which sits on Mondays and Thursdays and make a claim against her. If his virginity claim against her is accepted by the court, he may divorce her without paying her the ketubah. The chapter will continue to discuss the issue of virginity claims and how the judge is to adjudicate them. Note that virginity claims are already mentioned in Deuteronomy 22:13-22. The virginity of the bride was of high value in the ancient world and a man who thought that he was marrying a virgin but found that she was not had the right to claim that he had mistakenly married her. The mishnah does not state why widows are married on Thursday. This will be found later in the Talmud.
Shmuel asks why the Mishnah says that a virgin is married on the fourth day. Now we should note that his very question is puzzling—the Mishnah already stated why a virgin is married on Wednesday! The Talmud will ask this question soon. For now the answer is that we need a certain day to determine when a virgin is to be married so that we can know when the husband is obligated to feed her. A mishnah in the fifth chapter teaches that if the time for marriage comes and they are not married, she eats his food and if he is a Kohen, she may eat terumah. Let’s say they set the first of Adar as the wedding date. But the first of Adar falls on a Tuesday. In such a case the husband’s obligation to sustain his wife does not begin until Wednesday, for she would only be married on Wednesday. Furthermore, if she is married to a Kohen, it is from this date and onwards that she can begin to eat terumah, the food that only a priest may eat.
R. Joseph now raises a difficulty on the very statement that he himself transmitted in the name of Shmuel. [This is a strange phenomenon]. The difficulty seems to be that Shmuel used a source that was not taught [in the Mishnah] to explain another source that was taught [in the Mishnah]. However, even this difficulty is wrong. What Shmuel had really done is take one mishnah from the fifth chapter of Ketubot and used it to explain our mishnah from the first chapter of Ketubot. Therefore the Talmud rephrases his difficulty. Shmuel has used a mishnah that already has an explanation (our mishnah in the first chapter) and explained it with another mishnah that doesn’t have an explanation. This too is not such an easy difficulty—after all, the other mishnah is self-explanatory. Nevertheless, in tomorrow’s section we will see a rewritten version of Shmuel’s statement. If you’re wondering why this sugya seems to say so many things that do not make sense, it may be that it has been redacted or reedited so many times that the original meaning of Shmuel was lost in the shuffle. This is typical of sugyot at the beginning of tractates.
Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section the chapter opened explaining why virgins are married on Wednesday. Our section continues to discuss the subject.
This reworded statement of Shmuel is basically the mishnah: A virgin is married on Wednesday so that if her husband wishes to make a virginity claim, he can go to the court the next day. However, this version adds a difficulty. If virgins are wedded on Wednesday so that their husbands could come to court on Thursday with a virginity claim, then why not let them be married on Sunday and come to court on Monday. After all the court sits twice a week—Mondays and Thursdays.
Virgins are not married on Mondays because that would not leave enough time after Shabbat to prepare a proper wedding feast.
This now connects up with the earlier statement made by R. Joseph, but expands on it. If the time to get married arrives on the first day of the week, he does not feed her until the fourth day of the week. Furthermore, we learn a precedent from that case. If for some reason they cannot get married (illness or menstruation) then he need not give her food. Note that this is true even if he is sick and therefore the delay in marrying her is his fault. With regard to menstruation, women who were menstruating used to postpone their marriages because they could not have sex. Nowadays, weddings are no longer delayed for this reason.
Introduction<br>At the end of yesterday’s section we learned that if the husband or the wife delayed the wedding because of illness or menstruation, he must begin to provide her with food as soon as the date set for the wedding has passed. Today, the Talmud says that this is a question.
The Mishnah (in chapter five) clearly stated that if he has to wait a few days to marry her until Wednesday, he is not obligated to feed her until Wednesday. Note that this is at most a week’s delay. The question posed here is whether this is a precedent for other types of delays. If he can’t marry her because he is sick is he exempt from feeding her because in here too he was prevented against his will from marrying her. Or are the two cases different?
The Talmud now advances the question. If we say that if he became sick he has to provide her with food, because the delay in marriage was his fault, what if she became sick? Perhaps he could say to her that he is ready to get married, and that the delay is her fault. Therefore, he would not be obligated to provide for her. Or perhaps she could say to him in essence, tough luck. “Your field was flooded”—nothing you could do about it, but you lost out.
The Talmud now advances the question one final step. If illness might be considered his tough luck and therefore he would have to provide her with food, what about a case where she begins to menstruate and therefore has to delay the marriage? If she menstruates at her regular time, there is no doubt she cannot say to him, “Your field has been flooded” because she could have known that she was going to begin to menstruate. This was expected and therefore cannot simply be considered his bad luck. But what if she menstruates at an irregular time—can she say to him, “Your bad luck” or might this be considered the same situation as menstruating at a regular time since not all women menstruate with regularity?

Daf 2b

The mishnah uses the passive voice “they were not married” and not the active, “They did not marry them.” This means that even if the delay comes from the women, they still receive food from their husbands. However, the question is what sort of delay? If the women intentionally delayed the marriage, why should they eat of his food? That would not be fair at all. Therefore, it must refer to a situation where they were forced to delay the marriage. Nevertheless, even though the delay was due to the women, the husbands must provide them with food.
R. Ashi rejects R. Aha’s precise reading of the mishnah. He holds that only if the husband delays the marriage must he provide her with food. If the woman delays the marriage, the husband is not liable to provide for her until she is ready. The reason the mishnah used the passive, thereby referring to the woman, is to preserve the subject of the beginning of the mishnah which reads, “They give a virgin 12 months to get ready for the wedding.” Since the passive was only used to preserve the parallel with the first clause, we cannot read anything into its use.
Introduction<br>In the previous sugya we learned that if the husband was prevented by force (such as illness) from marrying his wife, he need not provide her with food. Thus we take situations of “force” (a person was prevented from doing something not of his choice) into account. The question in our sugya is whether or not force is taken into account in matters of divorce. The sugya will explain what this means.
According to Rava when it comes to divorce we don’t take issues of “force” into account. The Talmud will now give us some situations where this issue arises.
The Talmud now tries to find an earlier source for Rava. The first source is a mishnah that teaches that if a husband gives his wife a get and says to her that it will be valid only if he doesn’t return within twelve months, and then he dies within twelve months, the get is not valid because he did not return. The Talmud tries to derive from this mishnah what the rule would be if he didn’t come back because he got sick (“force”). The mishnah said it’s not a get if he dies—but if he doesn’t come back because he was sick, then the get would be valid. From here we could learn that “force” is not taken into account in matters of divorce. However, this derivation is not certain. It could be that the mishnah uses the example of death to teach us that death cannot occur after divorce. If this is what the mishnah teaches us then we could not deduce from it that if he is sick, the get is still valid.
The Mishnah already taught that there can be no divorce after death in an earlier mishnah. This would free up the mishnah of “if I do not return within twelve months” to teach that only death would prevent the get from being valid. If he doesn’t return due to illness “force” then the get would be valid.
The Talmud now posits that the mishnah about “If I don’t return within twelve months” was meant to teach against the ruling of “our rabbis” who said that the effectiveness of a document is set by its date. For instance if a man writes “thirteenth of Nisan” in his document but then says it won’t be operative until later, the document goes into effect on the thirteenth of Nisan. The mishnah rules against this position—if he says “after twelve months” then he meant to divorce her only after twelve months. Since that mishnah was needed to rule against this position of “our rabbis” it is not possible to use it prove that if he was prevented by “force” the get is valid. This leaves us with no proof of Rava’s overall position that “force” is not taken into account. The argument continues in tomorrow’s section.
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues searching for a source for Rava’s rule that we don’t take “force” into account when determining the validity of a get. As we saw what this means is that if a husband says his get will be valid if he doesn’t return within a certain period and then something happens that prevents him from returning the get is valid. The fact that it wasn’t his choice not to return (he was “forced” not to return) is not taken into account.
The mishnah says that if the husband makes such a statement and then dies before he can make it back to his wife within the twelve months the get is valid. At first the Talmud assumes that the same would be true if he grew ill. This would prove Rava’s point—we don’t take cases of “force” into consideration when determining the validity of the get.
Again the Talmud rejects the above deduction. Perhaps she is divorced only when he dies, for we could assume in that case he did not want her to be subject to the laws of levirate marriage (marriage to her dead husband’s brother in a case where the husband had no offspring). As an aside, this is why men sometimes would have written conditional gets. If they divorce their wives before they die, then the wife would not be liable for levirate marriage. Being subject to marrying his brother may not have been so desirable.<br>In any case, if the husband got sick and was prevented from returning within twelve months, he would have wanted to stay married to her. So therefore in this case it would not be a valid get. Again, we have failed to find a source for Rava’s ruling.
Here the Talmud finds a story as proof that we don’t take “force” into account.  Even if it is obvious that he wanted to return, if he’s not back, it doesn’t count. Shmuel states this explicitly. This would serve as a perfect source for Rava’s general rule that we don’t take “force” into account.
The Talmud now distinguishes between a regular case of “force” that could have been anticipated, and an unusual case. The case of the ferry not being able to cross over is a regular case. The husband should have stipulated before that if the ferry caused his delay, it would count as if he had returned. But the case of being sick is not regular. Therefore, we might take that into account. And if he is sick and cannot return for that reason, the get would be valid.<br>Thus we still have no support for Rava’s general principle. Stay tuned for tomorrow’s exciting conclusion.
Introduction<br>Today’s section concludes the search for a source for Rava’s rule if a husband cannot return due to duress the get is considered valid, even though he wanted to return and thereby annul the get.
Having failed to find an earlier source for Rava’s rule, the Talmud now resolves to saying that he stated his own reasoning. Basically he ruled that “force” is not taken into account due to the problems that would occur if it were taken into account.<br>The first problem would be for overly modest women. Let’s say that we were to take “force” into account, meaning if the husband was delayed by circumstances out of his control, the get would be invalid. In such a case, after twelve months the husband doesn’t return. For all we know he decided not to return of his own volition, as could happen. Maybe he found a different wife or a different job somewhere else. But the wife is afraid that maybe he didn’t return due to duress. She would wait for him like an “agunah”—a chained wife—and not remarry. This would obviously be a terrible situation. Therefore Rava rules that we don’t take into account why the husband did not return.

Daf 3a

The problem would also occur with what the Talmud terms “loose” women. Let’s say the husband doesn’t return and it was actually due to duress. If the halakhah was that we do take duress into account, then she is not divorced. She might disregard this possibility and go get married. When he comes back and proves that he could not return due to duress, the second marriage would be annulled and any children she had from her second husband would be mamzerim. This is obviously also a terrible result.<br>Thus, to summarize, it is best for everyone if duress is not taken into account. If the husband does not return in time, the get is valid. Why he did not return is not taken into consequence.
Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section we learned that Rava does not accept claims of “force” in matters of divorce because “modest women” might wait too long to get remarried and “loose women” might not wait long enough. What this seems to mean is that if the husband does not return because of “force/duress” legally she should not be divorced but the rabbis do consider her divorced in order to avoid certain problems. The issue here is that if she is not divorced how can the rabbis just consider her divorced? Isn’t that in essence allowing a married woman to marry another man! This is the topic addressed here.
If according to the laws of the Torah she should be married because the divorce should not have been effective (the fact that he didn’t return under duress should be taken into account), then how can the rabbis treat her as divorced?
The answer is affirmative. Basically, when people get married, they do so according to rabbinic law. They are buying into the system, if you will. Therefore, the rabbis always retain the power to annul their betrothal. This would mean that effectively, they were never married in the first place.<br>I should note that this statement appears six times in the Talmud. It almost certainly was not originally stated here, for here the topic is divorce, not betrothal. The rabbis are not annulling his betrothal, they are annulling his attempt to nullify his divorce. The statement was brought here to show the power of the rabbis to determine who and who is not married.
Ravina now asks a question of R. Ashi. It makes sense to say that the rabbis annul the betrothal if he betrothed her with money. Since they seem to have created this system of betrothal, they have the power to annul it. However, do they have such power if he betrothed her through intercourse, which is one of the three ways in which a man can betroth a woman (money, document or intercourse). It seems that this sugya considers intercourse to be a more de’orayta, or perhaps more valid, form of betrothal, than money. We should note that most sugyot consider all three forms of betrothal to be equally valid.<br>The answer is that the rabbis have the power to change the nature of his intercourse with her, or at least the legal ramifications of it. While he (and she) might have thought that they were engaging in intercourse for the sake of betrothal, the rabbis have the power to say that it is in essence an act of fornication. This would mean that her betrothal would be effectively annulled.
Introduction<br>This entire section is a mirror image of the previous sections. The sugya about divorce began with Rava saying, “And for matters of divorce, this is not so. Therefore Rava holds: There is no ‘force’ in matters of divorce.” The sugya proceeded searching for sources for Rava’s statement (and ultimately failed). In this section Rava says the exact opposite, and every source that was used to support him above, is here used as a difficulty on him here. But just as these sources failed to support him, they also fail to refute him. In the end both statements are left neither supported nor refuted.<br>This phenomenon of mirror-image sugyot occurs occasionally in rabbinic literature. It may be the result of the oral transmission of the literature—i.e. people did not know what earlier rabbis had said. Alternatively, it may be the result of later generations intentionally emending what earlier rabbis had said.<br>Since we have already basically learned this material, my commentary is brief below.
From this Mishnah the rabbis try to deduce that if he was prevented from returning by any other cause besides death, the divorce would be valid. This would prove that force is not taken into account (it is not a valid excuse for not returning on time).
The Mishnah may use the example of death not to teach that dying is different from not returning for any other reason. It may be to teach that he can’t divorce his wife once he is dead. If so, then even if he doesn’t return for another reason, she is still not divorced.
The fact that an earlier Mishnah also seems to teach that there is no divorce after death may be just to reject the opinion of the other rabbis who hold that we follow the date written on the document, not the date on which he says it will take effect. Thus we have two mishnayot: One teaches that there is no divorce after death, and the other stresses that this is true even if the date on the document is earlier than the date of death.
This Mishnah seems to teach that no matter why he doesn’t come back, death or illness, within twelve months, she is divorced. This would imply that there is no excuse of “force” in matters of divorce. This would be a difficulty on the second version of Rava’s statement.<br>But this reading is again rejected—it may be that the husband wanted to stipulate that if he dies within the twelve months, the divorce is valid so that his wife could avoid being subject to levirate marriage. But if he is prevented from returning for another reason, he would not want her to be divorced.
Again, this story seems like clear evidence that we don’t take “force” into account. Even if we know for sure that he wants to come back, and he was prevented by the lack of a ferry from crossing the river, he is still not considered as having returned on time to annul the get. “Force” is not taken into account. This is a difficulty for the second version of Rava’s statement.<br>The Talmud resolves the difficulty on Rava by proposing that this may be a different case, for the lack of a ferry is a foreseeable reason for not returning on time (like traffic today). In such a case, the husband should have stipulated at the outset that if the ferry prevents him from crossing the river, he will still be considered as having returned to annul the get. However, if the case was not foreseeable, then “force” might still be a proper excuse.<br>The sugya thus ends without a difficulty on Rava’s statement. Post-talmudic authorities were therefore left with two contradictory statements by Rava (there is/there is not “force” in matters of divorce).
Introduction<br>Today’s section returns to the Mishnah, which had stated that virgins were married on Wednesdays so that if the husband has a virginity claim, he could get to the court the next day.
Shmuel b. Yitzchak notes that the mishnah’s rule—that a virgin is wedded on Wednesday, depends on Ezra’s enactment that the courts should sit on Mondays and Thursdays. Before Ezra, who lived when the Jews returned from Babylonia in the fifth century C.E., the courts, at least according to this source, would sit every day of the week. During those times, it would not have mattered when a virgin was married for he could always go to the court the next day.<br>I should note that this source should not be taken at historical face value. It is unclear how historical any of the attributions of these enactments to Ezra are, and even if they were accurate, it is doubtful that Ezra would have limited the days on which the court convened. Rather, what is more likely is that at some point the days in which a court convened became standardized, coordinated with the market days which took place on Monday and Thursday. However, even this is not historically certain.
The Talmud notes that the way in which R. Shmuel’s statement is phrased lacks any halakhic significance. Why should we care what happened in the days before Ezra’s enactment? What does this teach us about the current situation?<br>The answer is that there are ramifications for today. If there are courts that sit today on other days of the week, not just Mondays and Thursdays, then a woman could be married any day of the week.<br>This answer in my opinion cuts to the original intent of R. Shmuel b. Yitzchak. By his time the system of fixed dates for courts was probably long in disuse (this can be noted in many other places in rabbinic literature, especially Tractate Megillah). What he is saying is that now that courts do not have fixed date, the rules of the Mishnah are also outdated.
There is another problem with her being married on any day of the week. If he marries her too early in the week, how can he prepare for the wedding? Above we learned that the sages did not allow him to marry her on Sunday for this would not give him time to prepare a proper wedding feast.<br>The Talmud almost ignores this question. As long as he did prepare diligently for the wedding, he can marry her whenever he wants. Again we can see that the system of fixed days of the week for marriage seems to have fallen apart. By this period in history, people seem to have been ignoring the tannaitic sources and getting married whenever they so desired.

Daf 3b

Introduction<br>Today’s section contains a baraita which goes into greater detail concerning what days of the week a virgin is married. The baraita will be explained in the coming sections as well.
This source was explained above at the beginning of the tractate. Although the court sits on Monday, theoretically allowing him to get to the court with a virginity claim should he marry her on Sunday, the rabbis did not allow this for this would not give him time to prepare a proper wedding feast. Marrying her on Wednesday allows for three days of preparation before the wedding. 
The baraita now notes that in reality people are no longer observing these customs. After the time of “danger” they took on the custom to marry on Tuesday. “Danger” usually refers to Roman persecution of the first and second centuries C.E.. The topic will be addressed in tomorrow’s passage.<br>And if there is duress, they get married on Mondays. Again, this will be explained (to a certain extent) tomorrow.
According to this source, sex with a virgin is prohibited on Shabbat for it makes a wound, and making a wound (intentionally) is considered prohibited. There will be a long passage that deals with this issue later in the Talmud. For now we should note what is odd here—if he marries her on Wednesday, why are they having sex for the first time on Friday night? It is possible that this baraita already relates to the later practice of getting married on Friday. This was common in the middle ages, but it is not clear whether it is reflected here or not.
Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section we saw a baraita which taught that in times of “danger” people began to have the custom of getting married on Tuesdays. Our sugya attempts to define this danger.
If the danger is of death, meaning that the Romans persecute the Jews in order to force them to abolish their custom of marrying virgins on Wednesday, then why does it use such temperate language—they had a custom to marry on Tuesday? They should abolish the custom altogether.<br>Rather, the danger is that the Romans decree that a virgin should first have relations with the governor. To avoid this, the Jews moved weddings to Tuesday.<br>We should note how historically problematic this source is. First of all, most scholars do not believe there ever was a “decree of the right of the first night.” This is a folk myth/fear that appears in many cultures, including several places in rabbinic literature. But scholars do not believe that it is historically accurate.<br>Second, how would moving the wedding to Tuesday have helped? The Romans would have figured things out pretty quickly, and begun raping virgins getting married on Tuesday. This question is asked below by the Talmud itself.<br>For these and other reasons as well, it seems unlikely that this explanation is historical. Rather, in my opinion what the baraita really seems to say is that when people saw that Romans were persecuting Jews at their weddings, they abandoned their consistent wedding practices. While this might be expressed by “they had the custom to marry on Tuesday,” it may mean that they just stopped marrying on Wednesday. I should note though that there is no historical evidence that Romans persecuted Jews specifically at their weddings.
Why call this danger when it is really a case of “duress.” Meaning that being raped is not a matter of life and death, and therefore why call it “danger” which usually means death.<br>The answer is that there are some women who would rather be killed than be raped by the governor. Therefore this is indeed a matter of life and death. It truly is “danger.”
A woman who is raped is not prohibited from returning to her husband, unlike an adulteress who is. Therefore, there is no reason for chaste women to prefer to die than be raped. These women should be taught that they should not choose martyrdom over rape. And then if it’s not a matter of life and death, why change the custom. [I fully realize that this is a very difficult thing to read. And I stipulate that the rabbis were often not particularly sensitive to women, including in this remark. Perhaps I could suggest one positive side to this comment. What they are saying is that when a woman has been raped, as horrible as that may be, she need not allow her life to be ruined. Or better yet, society must not look at such a woman as “ruined,” a tendency that certainly existed in the ancient world and still exists in some circles today. She can legally return to her husband and go on with her life. And her husband must take her back. I know this still makes people uncomfortable. Rape is a very difficult subject to discuss, especially for a man, which I am.]<br>The problem is that there are women who may intentionally have relations with the Roman governor. Such women are considered adulteresses and are legally not allowed to return to their husbands.<br>Furthermore, there is the issue of women married to kohanim (called here priestesses, or kohanot). A woman married to a priest who has been raped is not allowed to return to her husband, even though she clearly did nothing wrong. So simply allowing the Roman governor to rape these women before their marriage would prevent them from marrying their intended husbands.
If the Roman governor is decreeing that all virgins must first have relations with him, then the enactment to marry on Wednesday should be completely abolished. Why does the baraita just say that “people had the custom?”<br>The answer is that we don’t simply uproot a rabbinic enactment due to a persecution decreed by our oppressors. This is, I believe, a deep message. The persecutions we Jews undergo are temporary. Our traditions are what more permanent and we do not easily abandon them.
This is the question I asked above—if they move the custom of marrying virgins on a specific day, the governor will just come and have intercourse with the bride on that day.<br>The answer is that once the custom has been disrupted, the governor will not bother himself to seek out Jewish weddings. This might hint at what I had stated above. The baraita may testify to a general abandonment of fixed days for weddings, and not to their having been moved to another specific day. If the governor knows that virgins are married on Wednesdays, he will bring his men out to the Jewish wedding. But if he is not sure of this custom, he will not bother.
Introduction<br>Today’s section explains the last part of the baraita we have been studying, according to which if there is “duress” he can marry the virgin bride even on the second day of the week. The issue our section asks is what does the baraita mean by duress?
The problem is that the previous clause in the baraita said that due to danger people began to get married on Tuesdays. We obviously cannot explain the current clause in the same way we explained the earlier clause. So what does “duress” mean?
Rava suggests that the “duress” is a general coming to town, who assumedly may kill the Jews for publicly celebrating their wedding. The assumption is that they know he is coming on Wednesday. So then, the Talmud asks, why not get married on Tuesday? The answer is that if the general comes on Wednesday, his vanguard will show up on Tuesday. Under such a circumstance it is permitted to get married on Monday.<br>We should note that what this section is really trying to state, albeit in a circuitous manner, is that if there is any danger whatsoever, the wedding may be moved.<br>I should also note that Rava said both interpretations of the baraita—that the governor is coming to rape the virgin bride and that the general is coming to town. In my opinion, it is possible that originally he stated both of these statements on the same section of the baraita, but that the Talmud’s editors wished to use them as interpretations for both sections. This may explain some of the difficulties over the last two days.

Daf 4a

Introduction<br>In last week’s daf we learned that if there is some sort of duress the man can marry the virgin wife on a different day of the week (not Wednesday). Today’s section opens with an alternate explanation of “duress.” I should note that what the following sugya really wishes to do is explore the connection between mourning and marriage. This is not so much an explanation of the earlier baraita as it is an explanation of what is done in a case where a close relative dies right before a planned wedding. The idea of discussing marriage and mourning laws in juxtaposition will be a constant theme over the next couple of pages.
The reason one may need to get married on a day that differs from the prescribed fourth day of the week is if his or her mother or father died right before the wedding. Before I explain the baraita itself, I should note that this is a difficult explanation of “duress.” After all, if the wedding was supposed to be on Wednesday, and “duress” supposedly allows them to get married on Monday, then why was the bread baked etc. already on Monday. These are preps done at the last minute to make sure the food is fresh. It seems almost impossible that such a circumstance would ever arise. This is why I said that this section is not so much of an explanation of “duress” as it is an explanation of what to do if someone dies right before a wedding.<br>If all of the preparations have been made and at the last minute the father of groom or mother of the bride dies, then they put the dead body into a separate room, the couple have their first sexual relations and then they separate.
This is the continuation of the baraita from above. After the first intercourse, they now celebrate the regular seven days of wedding feast. The mourning is postponed till later.<br>However, this celebration is not complete. Even though they are celebrating, they still do not have sexual relations. Not only that, they have to sleep in separate rooms, being guarded seemingly by other men and women so that they do not transgress and have sex. [Below we will see that this is not normally the halakhah during mourning].<br>Finally, the baraita adds one last piece of information. Even though they are mourning and they are not sleeping together, she still adorns herself. The rabbis were quite adamant that the two of them should not do anything so that she would not look as beautiful to her new husband during their first month of marriage.
The Talmud reads the “father of the bridegroom and mother of the bride” as specific. These, according to the Talmud, are the main parties who prepare the wedding feast. If the mother of the bridegroom or father of the bride dies, they first mourn, postponing the wedding till later.<br>I should note that this is probably not the simple reading of the baraita. The simple reading is that the possessive nouns are distributive. Instead of saying, “father of the bridegroom or mother of the bridegroom or father of the bride or mother of the bride” the syntax abbreviates it. This phenomenon is found elsewhere in rabbinic language.<br>In addition, I don’t believe there is any reason to assume that it was specifically the father of the groom and mother of the bride who prepared the feast. It could have been any of the four parents.<br>What this does show us is why the rush to get married in the first place. The parents prepared the wedding feast. If one dies but the feast is already prepared, the only thing one can really do is just participate in the feast, despite the emotional hardship this would entail.
Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section we learned that if all of the wedding preparations had been made and then suddenly one of the parents of the bride or groom died, they have the wedding and first intercourse and then they observe the seven days of the wedding feast. They do not begin mourning until later. Today’s section continues to discuss that halakhah.
If water had already been put on the meat, then the meat must be eaten immediately or it will be lost. As a consequence, the wedding feast must continue despite the death of one of the parents. However, if water had not yet been put on the meat, it can still be sold. In such a case they would begin mourning and postpone the wedding. Today we might say this is like the catering already getting to the hall. If the wedding cannot carry on, there will be a substantial loss.
Both Rava and R. Papa limit R. Hisda’s rule from above. According to Rava, in a city, where it would be relatively easy to sell the meat, even if water was put on it, it still must be sold. This means they would never have the wedding before the funeral.<br>Papa says that in a village it would be hard to sell the meat even if water was put on it. Therefore even if water was not put on it, it is still not sold. They would always have the wedding before the funeral.<br>But the problem is that this basically negates any validity to R. Hisda’s statement. In cities they would always sell the meat no matter whether water was put on it or not. And in villages they would never sell meat. So what was R. Hisda referring to?<br>Ashi answers that R. Hisda could be referring to a small city such as Mata Mehasya. Mata Mehasya is large enough such that the meat could be sold if water had not been put on it. But it is too small to sell the meat if water had not been put on it.
This is the same baraita we saw earlier. The only difference is that a few words have been added so that it accords with R. Hisda. If he put water on the meat the meat is not sold. It is probably cited here at length so that the baraita can continue with another section.  And all these days he sleeps among the men and she sleeps among the women.
There are two new clauses here. The only clause that is not new is the middle clause, which we learned in yesterday’s section.<br>The first clause states that if his wife becomes a menstruant during the first week of their marriage, they must sleep in separate rooms. We should note that this is different from the normal situation when a woman becomes a menstruant. In normal cases, while they cannot have relations, they do not have to sleep in separate rooms.<br>The other new clause is that he may not have first time relations with her on Friday night or Saturday night. The Talmud will clarify this below. We have already seen another baraita that stated that first time relations on Friday night were prohibited because he causes a wound. Later on the Talmud will explain why this should be prohibited on Saturday night as well.
Introduction<br>Yesterday’s section included a baraita that taught that if the bride or groom are mourning right after their wedding, they must sleep in separate rooms. Today’s section deals with this clause.
The baraita taught that the couple had to sleep in separate rooms during the seven days of the wedding feast (when one of the parents died right before the wedding). These seven days are like a personal festival for the couple—both a festival and the wedding celebration last seven days. So they are in a sense keeping a festival and mourning at the same time. The fact that they don’t sleep together is support for R. Yohanan who said that even though mourning may not be observed during any festival, one still observes private forms of mourning. For instance, if one’s relative died during the festival he cannot begin mourning till after the festival. Nevertheless, he does observe some mourning practices, such as the prohibition on having sex.
Rava says that the baraita’s rule that they sleep in separate rooms is only if they did not yet have intercourse. In such a case we cannot trust them not to have sex, because this will be there first time and we can assume they are excited. If they sleep in the same room, they might have sex. But if they’ve already had sex at least one time, their passion should have been calmed a bit, and they can sleep in the same room. Note, the prohibition of sex remains.
The Talmud asks the obvious difficulty on Rava. How can he limit sleeping in separate rooms to a case where they have not yet had intercourse? The baraita stated that they first have intercourse and then they still have to sleep in separate rooms despite the fact that it is the first week of marriage.<br>The Talmud now adjusts what Rava was referring to. He was not referring to a case of mourning during the first week of marriage. Rather, he was referring to a case where the woman became a menstruant. If they have already had sex, then they may sleep in the same room (not the same bed). But if she became a menstruant after they were married but before they had sex for the first time, then they must sleep apart.

Daf 4b

The problem with the above resolution is that it sounds like the same exact rule applies to mourning as to a case where she is a menstruant—if they had sex once, they may sleep in the same room. But this is not true, for in the case of mourning even though they had sex once, they must still sleep in separate rooms in the case where they are mourners during the first week of their marriage. This was stated explicitly by the baraita.<br>The Talmud resolves this by adding the words “and he had not yet had intercourse with her” to the baraita. When mourning during the first week of marriage, they must sleep in separate rooms, but if she is a menstruant during the first week of marriage, they sleep in separate rooms only if they have not yet had sex.
Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section we learned that if he had slept with his new wife after their marriage, he could now sleep in the same room as her even if she becomes a menstruant. This means we assume they won’t have sex in such a situation. However, if he is a mourner during the first week of marriage, even if they have already had sex, they still have to sleep in separate rooms. This implies that it is easier for him (and her) to transgress the laws of mourning than it would be to transgress the laws of prohibited sex during menstruation. Today the Talmud questions that assumption.
These two sources both deal with the relations between a husband and wife when they are not allowed to have sex: mourning and menstruation. When she is a “niddah” (a menstruant) she can continue to perform the normal household work, but she cannot perform any forms of work that are considered to be acts of affection: mixing for him a cup of water and wine, making his bed or washing his face, hands and feet. This means that we are concerned lest by performing these acts, they will be led to have sex.<br>On the other hand, when mourning she may perform these actions. This implies that we are less concerned that they have sex when mourning.<br>Taken together, this contradicts the relationship between the two times in which sex is prohibited that we saw in the earlier sugya about the first week of marriage.
The Talmud resolves the difficult by positing that there is a difference between a case where he is in mourning and a case where she is in mourning. The earlier sources about sleeping in separate rooms were a case where he was mourning. When he is in mourning, they must sleep in separate rooms. Evidently he will still desire sex (perhaps as a comfort) and since she is not herself mourning, she will not stop him. But when she is mourning, she may perform actions of affection for him. Even if this causes him to desire her, she will rebuff him because she is in mourning.<br>The problem with this resolution is that the earlier baraita had referred to either of them being in mourning. So how could we limit that to a case where only he is in mourning?<br>The resolution is that the line “the father of the bridegroom or mother of the bride” refers to the other rules in the baraita concerning having the wedding before the funeral. These rules are true no matter who is in mourning. But as far as sleeping in separate rooms, this is true only if his family member died.<br>If some of this seems counterintuitive (for instance that he would be tempted to have sex while a mourner) we will continue the discussion tomorrow. Also there are other versions of this text that reverse the version found in the printed edition (the words for his/her are only a “yod” apart in Aramaic.) There are major problems with these other versions as well, so I have stuck with explaining the version preserved here.
Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section we learned that if the husband is in mourning during the first week of his marriage he and his wife must sleep in separate rooms. His mourning is not so serious in his own eyes, therefore we fear that he will transgress and sleep with his wife. But if she is mourning, she may perform work that shows her affections for him and we are not afraid they will have sex. This difference between her mourning and his mourning is questioned by today’s section.
The first baraita states that there are no differences between her mourning and his mourning. In both cases they basically observe mourning together. She does not put on makeup, and they both overturn the beds, a prominent sign of mourning in the Talmudic period. So how can we say above that there is a difference between the two?
To resolve the problem the Talmud basically adds in a line. When he is mourning, they sleep in separate rooms. But when she is in mourning they need not do so.
The problem with distinguishing between his mourning and hers is that the baraita explicitly stated “and so too,” implying that both situations are treated the same.<br>The resolution is that they are both the same vis a vis putting on paint and rouge. No matter who is mourning, she does not put on makeup. But if he is mourning, they must sleep in separate rooms, whereas if she is in mourning, they may sleep in the same room.
The second problem is that the baraita explicitly stated that she is with him, seeming to imply that although he is mourning, they may sleep in the same bed.<br>This too is resolved. “With him” means only that they sleep in the same house. This is confirmed by a halakhah stated by Rav to his son Hiyya upon the death of Hiyya’s wife’s parent. Rav told Hiyya that he must observe customs of mourning with her when in the same house. But when in a separate house, he need not mourn, for it was not his relative that died. What the word “he/she observes mourning with him” means is that they must keep mourning when in front of each other, but not when apart. It does not mean that they can necessarily sleep in the same bed.<br>I should note that this last halakhah is no longer really observed. We only mourn for our close relatives, and when a relative of our relative dies (in-laws) we may act out of great sympathy, but people no longer observe laws of mourning, even when in the presence of their partner. This is part of a long process of reducing the circle of people over whom we mourn.
Ashi says that the mourning practices during the first week of marriage are different from normal cases of mourning. Since the rabbis were more lenient in that case, the husband might come to sleep with his wife. But in other cases, since the laws are stricter, we have no such concern and they may sleep in the same room. 
Introduction<br>At the beginning of this amud (half-page) of Talmud there was a complex difficulty comparing the laws of the first week of marriage (if mourning, they sleep apart, if menstruating they may sleep in same room) with other times of one’s life (if mourning she may perform acts of affection, if menstruating she may not). These seem to be opposite, for in the first case we fear that he will sleep with her despite the fact that he is mourning, whereas in the second case we have no such fear. In today’s section, R. Ashi says that this comparison is not justified.
What is the leniency to which R. Ashi refers? It cannot be that he is allowed to have relations with her before the burial. That is not a leniency since he is not yet considered by law to be a mourner. The tannaim dispute when mourning begins. R. Eliezer holds that it is when the body has been taken out of the house to be brought to the cemetery. R. Joshua holds that it is when the tomb has been sealed with the stone rolled in front of the grave. But as long as the body is still in the house, all agree that mourning has not yet begun.<br>The leniency is therefore that they can celebrate the seven days of the wedding feast before they begin sitting “shiva,” the seven days of mourning. This really is a leniency that might lead to them having sex. They are partying and celebrating all day long, and at night we can imagine that despite the fact that they are also in mourning, they might come to have sex. But under more normal circumstances, the fact that a person is in mourning will deter them from having sex. They can therefore sleep in the same room.
We already learned earlier why the husband is not allowed to have sex with his virginal wife on Shabbat. The wound that first time sex on Shabbat is considered (by some) to be prohibited. But why should they not have sex for the first time after Shabbat.

Daf 5a

Introduction<br>Today’s section deals with the part of the baraita from above according to which a couple should not have first time sex on the evening before or after Shabbat. As I stated above, I think that what the baraita really means is that one should not get married on erev Shabbat (Friday) or motzei Shabbat (Sunday). Indeed, the version of this baraita in the Talmud Yerushalmi says exactly that.
Zera says that the reason that first time sex is prohibited on Saturday night is “reckoning accounts.” Rashi explains that if they get married on Saturday night the husband will have to make a big feast that night and on Shabbat he will calculate in his head how much the meal will cost. This is why getting married/first time sex is prohibited on Saturday night.<br>The problem with this explanation is that there are a series of sources cited by Abaye that say that one may reckon accounts on Shabbat as long as they are for the sake of a mitzvah. These sources are a general collection of what is permitted on Shabbat as long as they are done for the public good or for a mitzvah. One should not calculate on Shabbat calculations that are not for a mitzvah. I shouldn’t be talking with people about how much the house costs or car costs or things like that. But if we need to make some calculations in discussing a public good or mitzvah, it is permitted. So this cannot be the reason that it is prohibited to have sex with a virgin on Saturday night.<br>Stay tuned for tomorrow’s section for the exciting conclusion of this sugya!
Introduction<br>Yesterday’s section dealt with a baraita according to which sexual relations with a virgin is prohibited on Saturday night. But the amoraim failed to explain why this is so. Today’s section is a new interpretation of this prohibition.
Zera said that if they do the wedding on Saturday night, they might come to slaughter a bird on Shabbat for the wedding feast. I should note that this is in line with the reason it is very rare to have a Jewish wedding today on Saturday night. It is simply too likely that there will be some desecration of Shabbat involved in preparing for the meal.<br>Abaye notes that if we were concerned with slaughtering an animal for food on Shabbat, we should not allow Yom Kippur to fall on Monday (Sunday night), lest he slaughter a bird on Shabbat.<br>Rashi says that if Yom Kippur starts on Sunday night, he will need to eat a big meal during the day on Sunday and he might start preparing on Shabbat itself. 
There are two main differences between preparing for the wedding feast on Saturday night and preparing for Yom Kippur on Sunday night. First of all, for Yom Kippur one needs to prepare only for one’s family/oneself. It is not such a big meal that one would need to start preparing on Shabbat. Therefore it is not a problem.<br>Second, and I think this is really the key difference, there is a lot more time to prepare for Yom Kippur on Sunday night than there is for a Saturday night wedding. This seems to me to be such an obvious difference that Abaye’s difficulty makes little sense. In my opinion Abaye understood the prohibition as getting married on Sunday, such that the feast would fall Sunday night, the same time that the meal before Yom Kippur would fall if Yom Kippur was on Sunday night. So if one can have Yom Kippur on Sunday night, Abaye notes, why can’t one have the wedding feast. In contrast, the Talmud understood the prohibition as first time sex on Saturday night, which made the difficulty more difficult to understand. 
The Talmud concludes this section by noting that the same problem of preparing a meal on Shabbat could occur if they have first time sex on Friday night. They will need to prepare a big feast for that night, and they might come to slaughter the fowl right before it is cooked, after Shabbat has already begun.<br>I should note that by the medieval period, it had become the norm to get married on Fridays. People were simply poor and could not take off of work during the week. So they got married on Friday, and combined the wedding feast with the one big meal of the week, Friday night. As tends to happen in these situations, they found various ways to get around the Talmud’s prohibition.
Introduction<br>The Mishnah stated that a virgin is married on Wednesday so that if her husband has a virginity claim, he can get to the court on Thursday. However, as I noted in my explanation to the Mishnah, the rabbis provide other reasons why she is married on Wednesday (and a non-virgin on Thursday). One of those reasons is found in today’s section, but here it is woven into a sub-question concerning the Mishnah—while we already know she is married on Wednesday so that her husband can get to the court on Thursday, is the sex to occur on Wednesday night or can it occur during the day on Wednesday.
The issue the Talmud addresses is whether we are worried that he will “cool down.” What this means is that he will find his wife not to be a virgin and get upset immediately. But by the time the court sits the next day he will have already forgiven her, not make his virginity claim and stay married to her. We might very well ask why this would be so problematic? After all, wouldn’t we want him to stay with her anyways, especially if he wants to? The answer is found in the Yerushami which notes that if he finds her not to be a virgin, she might even be an adulteress. If she had sex with another man after betrothal, then she is an adulteress and according to halakhah she may not stay married her to her husband. Therefore, what we are afraid of is that he will forgive his wife for potentially having cheated on him.<br>If we are afraid that he will forgive her, then they should have sex only on Wednesday night, as close as possible to when the court convenes on Thursday morning. But if we are not concerned with him cooling down, then they can have sex Wednesday during the day.
As an answer to the question, the Talmud cites a baraita attributed to Bar Kapara. According to Bar Kapara, the reason for these specific days is that the “blessing” in the Torah was written on those days, on Thursday and Friday. The “blessing” is “be fruitful and multiply” which was said to the fishes on Thursday and to humans and other mammals on Friday.<br>From here the Talmud concludes that we are not concerned that he should “cool down.” The sex is to occur at night between Wednesday and Thursday, but not for that reason. Rather, the sex occurs at night because of “blessing.”
If a virgin has first sex on Wednesday night (beginning of Thursday) because of blessing, then the widow should also have sex on that day. So why is her day Thursday night/Friday? The answer seems obvious—the day on which people were blessed is preferable to the day when fish were blessed.<br>We should note that the reason of “blessing” is considered only partial—it doesn’t explain why a virgin is married on Wednesday. After all, if the reason was “blessing” then she should have been married on Thursday, because the blessing for people was said on Friday. “Blessing” only explains why the sex is on Wednesday night.
The Talmud now brings in another baraita that explains why a widow has first sex on Thursday night, not Thursday during the day. Again, I should note that originally this baraita explained why she is married on Thursday in the first place, not why the sex occurs on Thursday night. She is married on Thursday so that her husband will celebrate with her three days, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Since second marriages are less celebratory, if he married her a different day of the week, he would go right back to work.<br>But the Talmud again takes the baraita and uses it to explain a side question—when do they have first sex: Thursday during the day or Thursday night. We should note that it is somewhat unlikely that his going to work on Friday will be determined by whether they had sex during the day on Thursday or at night.
 Both reasons “they watched over” and “blessing” lead to the conclusion that a widow is wed on Thursday and the first intercourse takes place on Thursday night. So, the Talmud asks, as it often does, is there any practical ramification between the two? There are indeed two cases where there is a practical ramification. First of all, if the man does not work. In such a case, the reason of “blessing” dictates that he still have first intercourse with his wife on Thursday night, because the blessing to people was said on Friday. But if we use the reason of “they watched over” then we don’t have to worry about him going to work on Friday, because he never goes to work.<br>The second difference is if there is a festival on Friday. In such a case we need not worry about him going to work. But the reason of “blessing” would still hold true.<br>In short, the reason of “they watched over” is not absolute. It changes based on circumstance. But the reason of “blessing” is always present.

Daf 5b

Introduction<br>Today’s section is here because it begins with another derashah (loosely translated as sermonic comment) attributed to Bar Kappara, the same sage whose derashah was found in yesterday’s section. The topic has nothing to do with the issue being discussed in Ketubot.
Bar Kappara rhetorically wishes to prove that the works of the righteous are greater, i.e. harder to create, than the creation of heaven and earth. In creating the heavens and earth, God is described as using only one hand. In contrast, in creating the Temple, God is described as using two hands (the Hebrew is in the plural). Rashi explains that the Temple is the “work of the righteous” for in reality it is people that actually build the Temple.
Hiyya, a sage of Babylonian origin who moved to Israel, raises some difficulties on the notion that God used only one hand in creating the world. Psalms 95 says that God used His “hands” in forming the dry land—two hands. This difficulty is answered by taking note of the defective spelling of the word, “ידו” and not “ידיו.” [Note that the Masoretic text does not use the defective spelling. It is not all that uncommon for the Talmud to refer to a biblical text slightly different from the text in use today.] The defective spelling means that the verse really says only one hand.<br>The second difficulty is from the verb form—the plural of “formed.” This again implies that God used two hands in forming the dry land.<br>Nahman b. Yitzchak solves the plural form by stating that it refers to fingers, not hands. God created the world using one hand, but at least he used more than just one finger.
Again, a verse is cited to show that God used two hands to create the world.<br>As a resolution, the Talmud reinterprets the verse. “The work of his hands” does not refer to God’s creation of the world—it refers to the acts of the righteous, the righteous deeds that they perform. And who testifies as to the deeds of the righteous? The “firmament” (Rakia in Hebrew, the name of my youngest daughter!) responds to the righteous deeds of human beings by bringing rain. This reflects the Jewish notion that God blesses the world with rain in response to the good deeds done by the righteous. 
Introduction<br>Today’s section contains another derashah by Bar Kappara, the same sage whose words were the focus of the previous two sections.
The Torah mandates that people own a peg to bury their waste when they go to the bathroom in the fields. The word for “among your gear” is “azen” which sounds like “ozen” the Hebrew word for ear. Bar Kapara therefore understands this to mean that you should have a “peg” for your ear. If you are about to hear something unworthy, you should put your finger in your ear so that you do not hear it. There may also be something close to the simple meaning of the verse in this derashah. The Torah mandates that we keep our living quarters clean, free from human waste. Bar Kapara adds that if this is true with physical waste, how much more is it true with unworthy words, mental/social waste products.
This same message is derived from R. Elazar’s question concerning why people’s fingers are shaped like pegs. First the Talmud notes that each finger has a certain halakhic purpose. The little finger is called the “zeret” and it is used to measure a part of the high priest’s breast plate. The ring finger is called “kemitzah” for the priest uses it when taking a fist of the meal (minhah) offering. The middle finger is called “amah” which means cubit, and this finger is used in constituting a cubit. The pointer is called “etzba” and it is used to apply blood to the altar. The thumb is called “gudal” (agudal in modern Hebrew) and it is the finger on which the Torah commands blood to be put for certain sacrifices.<br>Rather, the question is—why are fingers shaped in such a way? The answer is the same as above—so that we can put them in our ears to prevent ourselves from hearing bad things.<br>It is interesting to note that the ear is a sensory organ that is very hard to close. We can close our eyes and we can even pinch our noses shut. But even when we close our ears with our hands, sounds can make it through. This means that we must be especially cautious not to be near unworthy things when they are stated.
The sugya concludes with two additional exhortations not to listen to unworthy things.<br>I must share a story with you. My grandmother, of blessed memory, was in an accident when she was young, and lost hearing in one of her ears. In my house we did a short, abbreviated birkat hamazon on Shabbat. She was more Orthodox and wished to do the full birkat hamazon. So to prevent getting confused, she would fold up the bottom of her one hearing ear, and insert it in her ear, exactly like it says here.<br>The ear is the softest of the external organs. It is “burned first” which can be taken literally, in that if a person is burned, the ears are most easily destroyed. It also can be taken figuratively. Our ears are always open, making them particularly vulnerable to the harm done by “idle things.”.
Introduction<br>Today’s section begins a long passage concerning whether it is permissible to have first time sex with a virgin on Shabbat. There were several baraitot (tannaitic sources) cited earlier that prohibited this. Nevertheless, the Talmud, for whatever reason, ignores those sources.<br>The proper place for this sugya is really Tractate Shabbat for it mostly deals with issues of what constitutes forbidden labor on Shabbat. In the Yerushalmi it is found in Tractate Berakhot, for the passage cites a Mishnah from Berakhot concerning reciting the Shema during the first week of marriage. The Bavli brings the entire passage here to Ketubot for it is related to the first week of marriage, a topic discussed in this chapter.<br>Today’s section is an elaborate question, typical of the Bavli, where every possible reason to permit and prohibit are examined. The point of this question seems to be to examine every theoretical possibility in understanding the nature and purpose of first-time sex on Shabbat and whether it should be prohibited. It is an elaborate question, and since it is so highly theoretical, some of the possibilities mentioned might seem strange.<br>As usual, I adopt a neutral, clinical tone in discussing these matters. I realize and understand that some people are troubled by men discussing women’s bodies.
This is in essence an anatomical question. If the blood is simply stored up in the woman’s womb and waiting to come out, then the husband is not wounding her by having sex for the first time. He is just letting out already-gathered blood, which is not a Sabbath transgression. But if he is opening a fresh wound, then it is prohibited.
If the blood is stored up in the womb, it is allowed, but only if he just needs to let out the blood (perhaps as a sign that she was a virgin). But if he needs to create an opening to allow future intercourse, then it is forbidden, since it is forbidden to make a new opening on Shabbat.
We had said above that if he didn’t need the opening, then it is permitted. This implies that if one performs a forbidden act on Shabbat, but did not intend to do that act, the act is permitted. In other words, he intended to let out the blood. It was not his intention to create an opening, but an opening was created. Is this permitted? There is a dispute about this issue among tannaim. R. Shimon holds that in cases such as these, the act is permitted. But R. Judah holds that it is prohibited.
There is yet another aspect to this question: Is he considered as having damaged or improved? R. Judah holds that if one performs a forbidden labor on Shabbat, but that act was destructive, he is not liable. So if the halakhah follows R. Judah in that unintentional acts are prohibited, do we also follow R. Judah in that destructive acts are not prohibited?
The Talmud now elaborates on the second possibility from above—first-time sex creates a wound and therefore should be prohibited. However, this is only true if his intent is actually to create a wound. But if his intent is simply to have pleasure, then the wound is a by-product. It is not his intent and therefore the act is permitted.
If he intends just to have pleasure, then the act is permitted, but only if the halakhah follows R. Shimon. R. Shimon says that if one did not intend to perform the forbidden act, it is permitted. But if the halakhah follows R. Judah, it is prohibited.
If the halakhah follows R. Judah and therefore it should be prohibited, we still have to ask whether it is a destructive act or constructive one. If it is considered destructive it is permitted.
Even if we determine that first-time sex is destructive, it is only R. Judah who would permit it. R. Shimon forbids destructive acts.<br>This concludes the complex question that opens the sugya. As we shall see, the amoraim barely relate to this question. It seems to have been a late addition to the passage, inserted by the editors of the Talmud, as a sort of introduction to all of the legal ramifications and principles related to the particular topic of first-time sex on Shabbat.

Daf 6a

Introduction<br>Today’s section begins to cite traditions that will answer the question asked at the end of last week’s daf—is it permitted to have sex with a virgin on Shabbat?
The amoraim Rav and Shmuel debate whether it is permitted. Curiously (or perhaps not so curiously) every school wants to say that their rabbi, be it Rav or Shmuel, is the lenient one. This is noted explicitly by R. Nahman b. Yitzchak, who says that if you can’t remember which bet midrash teaches the debate which way, you can remember that everyone is lenient on themselves. Seems that no one really wanted to deny sex with a virgin on Shabbat.
The Talmud initially raises a difficulty on the version of the dispute which reads that Rav is the stringent amora, forbidding sex with a virgin on Shabbat. There is another tradition where Rav states that it is forbidden to squeeze back in a stopper into a brewing vat on Yom Tov, the festival. This is because by doing so he will inevitably squeeze some beer out of the cloth stopper, and squeezing liquids out of something is prohibited on Shabbat/Yom Tov. Now this is true even though his intention was not to squeeze out the liquid. His intention was to put the stopper back into the brewing vat. This implies that Rav rules like R. Judah—even though someone’s intention was to perform a permitted act, if in doing so he performs a forbidden act, it is prohibited. So if Rav rules like R. Judah how can he allow sex with a virgin on Shabbat, since this will cause a wound?<br>The resolution is that in the case of putting the stopper into the brewing vat, even R. Shimon, the lenient sage, would prohibit because it is a case where the prohibited work, squeezing, will certainly be performed. This is called by the Talmud a case of “if he cuts off its head, will it not die.” According to Rashi this refers to a case where someone wants to give his son the head of a bird to play with as a toy (they did not have ipads back then). He does not want to kill the bird, just give its head to his son to play with as a toy. But obviously, he cannot give the head to the child without killing the bird, which is prohibited on Shabbat. So he cannot claim that cutting the head off is permitted because it was not his intention that the bird die. This rule teaches that while R. Shimon generally permits someone to perform an action if his intent was not to perform the prohibited labor, if the prohibited labor is certain to occur, even R. Shimon prohibits.<br>In sum, Rav can logically prohibit putting back the beer vat plug on Shabbat, but still allow one to have first time sex on Shabbat. Evidently, the wound is not certain.
In these traditions a few amoraim relate that in general Rav holds like R. Judah—even when it is not one’s intention to perform the forbidden labor, the act is still prohibited. So how can the earlier amoraim hold that Rav was lenient in the case of sex on Shabbat with a virgin? The same is true with Shmuel—he usually rules like R. Shimon, that if one’s intent is not to perform the forbidden labor, the act is permitted. So how can he rule that sex on Shabbat with a virgin is prohibited?
Even if Rav holds like R. Judah, he still can allow sex with a virgin on Shabbat because no matter how we explain, the labor is one of damaging. It is not a constructive act, and therefore R. Judah permits it. The explanation refers to the question found in yesterday’s section. If we say that the blood is stored in the womb and he is making an opening, then this opening may still be considered damaging and not constructive. And if he holds that the blood is the result of a wound, the act can still be deemed destructive. In either case it is a wound.
Introduction<br>We continue to discuss sex with a virgin on Shabbat. I want to reiterate that I realize that these discussions are uncomfortable for some people, but that I adopt a clinical approach to their analysis. I neither condemn practices mentioned in them (I think they were often the norms of the time) nor do I suggest that they should be norms for our times.
This source is Mishnah Niddah 10:1. The Mishnah is concerned with differentiating between menstrual blood and virginal blood. If the wife menstruates, she and her husband may no longer have sex. But virginal blood does not cause sex to be prohibited. The determination hinges on whether she is old enough to menstruate. If she is, then a longer period is given during which we assume the blood is virginal. For instance, if she is too young to menstruate, Bet Hillel says that we assume that any blood is virginal until she heals from the original would caused during sex. But Bet Shammai says we can assume that the blood is virginal for only four nights.<br>The key to the difficulty raised by R. Hisda is the second clause. If she has reached the age of menstruation he is allowed to assume the blood is virginal for the first four nights. To R. Hisda this means that even if he had not yet had sex with her, he still may do so for all of the first four nights after they were wed on Wednesday, including Shabbat. This is proof that sex with a virgin is permitted on Shabbat.

Daf 6b

Rava tries to resolve the prohibition of having sex with a virgin on Shabbat by claiming that the Mishnah permits every night except for Shabbat.<br>Against this Abaye argues that the Mishnah explicitly says “four nights.” This must include Shabbat.
Rava now resolves the difficulty in an entirely different manner. The Mishnah rules that it is permitted to have sex on Friday night with his new wife, but only if they already had intercourse on Wednesday or Thursday night. This accords better with the Mishnah, which assumes they are married on Wednesday and therefore the sex that occurs on Friday night would not be when she is a virgin.<br>If we were to ask why the Mishnah bothers teaching that he can have sex with her on Friday night after they have already had sex on the previous nights, the Talmud notes that we might have thought that sex (or sex with a woman who had only begun to have sex very recently) was prohibited on Shabbat, even though it is not first time sex. This is similar to a different case taught by Shmuel. Shmuel allows one to enter a narrow opening (probably some hole in a wall) even though he will cause pebbles to break loose. This is permitted because the opening already exists and it is certainly not his intention to cause the pebbles to fall. So too, we might have thought it would be prohibited to have second or third time sex on Shabbat, just as it is prohibited to have first time sex. It is not. 
Introduction<br>The discussion of sex on Shabbat with a virgin continues. Again, an amora raises a difficulty on the position that it is prohibited.
According to the Mishnah in Berakhot, a bridegroom is exempt from reciting the Shema because he is too concerned with the task at hand (first time sex) and will not be able to focus on the Shema. The Mishnah states without any ambiguity that if he has not yet had sex with his new wife, he is exempt till Saturday night. This seems to imply that he could be having sex for the first time with his virgin wife on Friday night.
Abaye denies that the Mishnah allows a husband to have sex for the first time on Friday night. He is exempt on Friday night from the Shema not because he could possibly have sex with his virgin wife that night. He is exempt because he is anxious that he did not have sex the first two nights of marriage. We should note that this is an entirely different type of anxiety. In the case where he was going to have sex that night, he is anxious about the act itself. He won’t be able to focus on the Shema because he has something to do (and he’s understandably nervous about it). According to Abaye, he’s just distressed and nevertheless, he is still exempt from Shema. Rava is about to pounce on this notion.
Rava responds to Abaye that simple “anxiety” over something that already happened is not sufficient to exempt one from reciting the Shema (or observing other commandments). If this were so, then even one who was upset that his ship had already sunk would be exempt. As proof Rava cites Rav’s statement that a mourner is obligated in all commandments except tefillin. He is exempt from tefillin because they are considered an “ornament.” This is based on a midrashic reading of Ezekiel 24:17. Ezekiel is mourning the loss of his wife, but God tells him that he is not allowed to mourn. He is instructed to wear his “ornament” which the rabbis interpret as tefillin. Since Ezekiel the mourner is told to wear tefillin, it seems that other, regular mourners, may not.
Introduction<br>Rava now says that there is a tannaitic dispute as to whether one can have sex with a virgin on Shabbat.
According to the first baraita, he is exempt from Shema on the third night if he has not yet had sex. If the wedding took place on Wednesday, then the third night is Friday night. This means that sex with a virgin is permitted on Friday night, and therefore he is exempt from the Shema.<br>The second baraita says that in all cases the groom must recite the Shema on Friday night. This baraita would hold that sex with a virgin is prohibited, and hence there is no reason for him to be exempt.
Abaye holds that all tannaim rule that sex with a virgin on Shabbat is prohibited. It is not a tannaitic dispute as Rava claimed. So how come one tanna holds that a groom is obligated to recite the Shema on Friday night? That tanna holds that his anxiety over not yet having had sex is what exempts him from the Shema and not the fact that he is going to have (or at least attempt) sex that night.
The Talmud now brings another baraita which shows a tannaitic dispute about sex with a virgin on Shabbat. Rabbah says that the “sages” who allow this are R. Shimon, for R.Shimon holds in general that if one does not intend to perform the forbidden labor, the act is permitted. Here his intention is to have sex, and not to cause a wound. Therefore, the sex is permitted even if he does end up causing a wound.
Introduction<br>At the end of yesterday’s section, Rava said that R. Shimon, who in general allows one to perform an act on Shabbat as long as his intention was not to perform a forbidden labor, would allow a man to have sex with a virgin on Shabbat. Since his intention is not to make a wound, the act is permitted.<br>In today’s section Abaye calls this into question because while making a wound was not the husband’s intention, it seems to be a certainty that it will occur.
Abaye argues that sex with a virgin is like the case of the bird having its head cut off so the kid could use it as a toy (I explained this in 6-1). Since the forbidden labor will certainly occur, R. Shimon agrees that the act is prohibited.<br>Rava responds that there are those who can have sex with a virgin without causing a wound. They somehow “move to the side.” This is a skill referred to here and in several other places in the Talmud. It is unclear what exactly it is, but it sounds like some kind of gentle way of having intercourse such that the woman’s hymen would not be broken. Since the forbidden labor will not certainly occur, R. Shimon would permit.
If the person is skilled enough to know how to have intercourse by moving aside, why should he be so anxious such that he need not read the Shema that night? In other words Abaye is saying that if you claim that the person has skill, then the entire baraita about Shema makes no sense.<br>Rava responds that the baraita refers to one who is not skilled. He is anxious so he is exempt from Shema.<br>But, Abaye responds yet again, if this is true, then we should have said that one who is skilled is allowed to have sex with a virgin on Shabbat, but one who is not skilled may not do so.<br>Rava responds that since most people have such skill, it is permitted for all men to have sex with a virgin on Shabbat
Rava (a different amora with this name) raises a different difficulty. Elsewhere in the tractate we shall see that people were concerned about the evidence that she was a virgin. To ascertain this evidence a sheet was used (this is mentioned in the Torah as well). Furthermore, groomsmen were placed in or at least near the room to make sure that he or she did not fake or lose the evidence. The sheet and the system of groomsmen make sense only if it is expected that she will bleed from the wound that he creates. If most men know how to have sex without rupturing the hymen, then why bother with the sheet or groomsmen?<br>Abaye answers that the groomsmen are there lest the husband tamper with the evidence. They would make sure that the husband does not hide the evidence of her virginity and then claim that she was not a virgin. We should note that this type of scheming husband is already described in Deuteronomy.
Introduction<br>Today’s short section cites another difficulty on the halakhah that it is forbidden to have sex with a virgin on Shabbat.
A Mishnah from Tractate Shabbat rules that lancing an abscess is permitted on Shabbat, as long as his intention is not to make an opening, just to release the pus. With regard to sex with a virgin, R. Ammi assumes that his intention is to release the blood. Perhaps this assumption is based on the fact that the husband wishes to see the blood as a sign of her virginity. In any case, this Mishnah is used by R. Ammi to prove that sex with a virgin should be permitted on Shabbat.<br>The Talmud responds that anatomically these are different cases. In the case of the abscess, the pus is stored up and is ready to be released. It is not in the walls of the organs. Thus this is permitted because he is not making a wound. But in the case of virginity blood, while the blood is stored up, it is not ready to be released, and therefore this could be considered a wound. Therefore, it may be forbidden, for by releasing the blood through a wound he is performing the forbidden labor he intended to perform.

Daf 7a

Introduction<br>Today’s section concludes the discussion of sex with a virgin on Shabbat. I know it’s been a long discussion. It does seem that this was a hot topic in rabbinic circles, perhaps for two reasons. First of all, it refers to sex, a topic that the rabbis do seem to spend a considerable amount of energy discussing. Second, it has significant relevance to some general principles concerning Shabbat, another topic that rabbis spend considerable time discussing.
The Talmud now begins to relate some actual rulings that seem to have been issued by rabbis. In other words, these are not theoretical halakhot or discussions, such as those that appeared above. They are concrete rulings. R. Ammi allows sex with a virgin on Shabbat.<br>The other rabbis raise a difficulty we have not yet seen elsewhere—what about the ketubah? Generally, it is prohibited for a man to have a wife without having given her first her ketubah. The rabbis’ difficulty on R. Ammi reflects the idea that they would wait to give the ketubah until after the marriage had been consummated. Perhaps this was done so that he could ensure that she was actually a virgin. We should note that this is not normative practice. In any case, if he has first sex on Shabbat, how could he write for her a ketubah that night, when writing is forbidden on Shabbat?<br>The answer is that he could just give her some movable goods, at least as temporary substitute for her ketubah.
This time we have two versions—either R. Zevid permitted others to have first intercourse on Shabbat, or he himself had first intercourse. In either case it is permitted.
Rav Judah allowed one to have sex with a virgin on a festival. But what we do not know is if he would have extended the same permission to Shabbat. As we shall see, the laws of the festival and the laws of Shabbat are not always the same.<br>Papi argues that Rav Judah would have permitted also on Shabbat. The only reason he permitted specifically on the festival is that he was asked about such a case.
Papa disagrees with R. Papi, and holds that while it permitted to have sex with a virgin on the festival, it is not permitted on Shabbat.<br>Papi then asks what grounds there might be for such a difference. The main difference between Shabbat and the festival is that one is allowed to prepare food on the festival. This includes slaughtering an animal, lighting a fire and cooking. R. Papi assumes that R. Papa makes the following argument. The reason to prohibit sex with a virgin on Shabbat is that it makes a wound. Making a wound on the festival (slaughtering an animal) in order to eat (for a necessity) is permitted. Therefore, making a wound on the festival when it is not for the sake of eating (first time sex) should also be permitted.<br>The problem, R. Papi says, is that we don’t consistently apply such thinking. Lighting a fire on the festival is permitted for the sake of cooking. But it is not permitted for the sake of burning incense. From here we can see that just because something is permitted when done for a necessity is it permitted when performed not for a necessity.<br>Papa responds based on a midrash on the last two words of the verse, “by every person.” The act is permitted only if all people benefit from it, meaning all classes of society engage in it. Incense was something used by the rich, and therefore it cannot be burned on the festival. But sex is something everyone does, and therefore it is permitted on the festival, even if it causes a wound.
Aha raises a difficulty on the above conclusion that only if everyone is customary to use a certain item can the work involved be performed on the festival (if the same work is permitted when done to prepare food). Deer meat was evidently not eaten by everyone, only by the rich. So using this logic if one came across a deer (not by hunting), he could not kill it to eat it on the festival! This is obviously not true. So, the question is: how come it is permitted to slaughter a deer on the festival?<br>To answer, R. Ashi revises the midrash—if it is something “needed” by every person, it is permitted. Deer meat might be eaten only by the rich, but it is still food, and everybody needs food. Therefore, even though it is rich person’s food, one can slaughter it on the festival. In contrast, incense is not something everybody needs. Therefore, it cannot be burned on the festival.
This section begins with another halakhic ruling—this time prohibiting sex with a virgin on Shabbat.<br>The Talmud seems to think that the word “instruction” implies that something should be permitted—so how is it that R. Yohanan “instructed” something that it is forbidden.<br>In the end they find two cases where the word “instruction” is used and it does create a prohibition. The first is a Mishnah from Nazir 3:6 where Bet Hillel instructions Helena the Queen that she should be a Nazirite for another seven years after moving to Israel. See there in my comments in Mishnah Yomit for my information.<br>The second has to do with what makes an animal a “trefa”—unfit to be eaten. If its spinal cord was severed it is a trefa. Rabbi instructs strictly that even if it was only perforated, it is a trefa.
The sugya ends by ruling that despite some rabbinic opposition, in the end it is permitted to have sex with a virgin on Shabbat. Tomorrow we move on to a different topic.
Introduction<br>Today’s section begins a long discussion about the marital blessings. The first blessing discussed is the “bridegroom’s blessings” called today the “sheva berakhot.” While that term is lacking in the Talmud, the blessings are referred to and we will learn them later on.
According to Rav, the bridegroom’s blessing is recited at the marriage of both a virgin and a widow. As we shall see, there are some traditions that deny the recitation of this blessing at woman’s second wedding.
The Talmud raises a difficulty from another statement where R. Huna says that there is no blessing whatsoever for marrying a widow (synonymous with any woman being married for a second time).<br>The solution is that it depends on whether it is the man’s first wedding. If a young man, marrying for the first time, marries a widow, the blessing is recited. But not, if both are marrying for the second time, then there is no blessing.
The Talmud now cites the source for the halakhah that requires the presence of ten for the bridegroom’s blessing. The source is the episode where Boaz marries Ruth (at least this is how the rabbis understand the episode). Boaz gathers ten men to recite the blessing, despite the fact that both he and Ruth were previously married.<br>To resolve the difficulty the Talmud revises R. Huna’s statement. If the widower is marrying a virgin, the blessing is recited for all seven days. But if he is marrying a widow, the blessing is still recited, but only for one day. Boaz and Ruth indeed had the blessing recited, but only for one day.
The Talmud now cites a baraita that appeared earlier in this chapter. The baraita asked why a widow is married on Thursday. The answer was that this gives the husband three days to celebrate with her until he goes back to work on Sunday. The problem is that this doesn’t match either of the situations mentioned above. If he is a widower marrying a widow, then the blessing is only one day. And if he is a young man, getting married for the first time, then the blessing should be seven days, even if he is marrying a widow.<br>The Talmud resolves this by separating the requirement for reciting a blessing from the requirement to celebrate. This baraita could therefore refer to either a widower or a young man. If it refers to a widower, then he recites the blessing for one day, but celebrates for three. If it refers to a young man, then he recites the blessing for seven days, but only celebrates for three.

Daf 7b

Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section we learned that if a man is marrying for the first time the bridegroom’s blessing is recited for seven days, even if his wife is marrying for the second time. Today’s section calls this into question.
A baraita states that the blessing is said for only one day when it is a widow that is being married. This seems to be true no matter who is marrying her, a widower or a young man.<br>The Talmud resolves the difficulty by limiting the baraita to a widower marrying a widow.
The Talmud now basically says that if there was a distinction between a young man marrying a widow and a widower marrying a widow, the baraita should have said so. The fact that it didn’t implies that there is no such distinction. In all cases, the widow should get only one day.<br>The resolution is that the baraita does not teach all details. If the woman is a virgin she always has seven days of a blessing. If she is a widow, then she gets at least one day. But, if she is marrying a young man, then she gets seven days of blessing.
The Talmud now returns to the derivation of the law requiring the presence of a minyan to recite the bridegroom’s blessing. The first tradition was cited above in section two. The second derivation is that of R. Abahu who locates it in a verse from Psalms. He seems to read “from the fountain” as referring to the fountain from which human life is formed, i.e. the woman’s womb. A blessing over the “fountain” requires an “assembly” which in Jewish tradition is at least ten.
Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section we saw two different reasons for why the presence of a minyan is required for the recitation of the bridegroom’s blessing. Today, the Talmud asks the typical question—what does each sage do with the verse used by the other sage.
Nahman uses R. Abahu’s verse to make the same derashah made in a baraita by R. Meir. To R. Meir (and R. Nahman) the word “ממקור” which I have translated as “from the fountain” means from the womb. According to the verse, someone blessed God from the womb. To R. Meir, this refers to the fetuses in their mother’s wombs when Israel crossed the sea. The Israelites rejoicing at going free extended even to the unborn babies.
Why doesn’t R. Abahu agree with R. Nahman/R. Meir’s derashah on the verse from Psalms?<br>Abahu responds that if the verse meant to refer to the unborn babies it should have specifically said “from the womb.” Since it uses a different word, “from the fountain,” it must refer to something else, and that is the “matters of the fountain” which seems to refer to something broader than the fetus, perhaps sexuality in a broader sense.
Introduction<br>Having explained how R. Nahman uses the verse R. Abahu used to prove that the bridegroom’s blessing requires a minyan, the Talmud now asks the opposite question—what does R. Abahu do with R. Nahman’s blessing?
Nahman uses R. Abahu’s verse to make the same derashah made in a baraita by R. Meir. To R. Meir (and R. Nahman) the word “ממקור” which I have translated as “from the fountain” means from the womb. According to the verse, someone blessed God from the womb. To R. Meir, this refers to the fetuses in their mother’s wombs when Israel crossed the sea. The Israelites rejoicing at going free extended even to the unborn babies.
Why doesn’t R. Abahu agree with R. Nahman/R. Meir’s derashah on the verse from Psalms?<br>Abahu responds that if the verse meant to refer to the unborn babies it should have specifically said “from the womb.” Since it uses a different word, “from the fountain,” it must refer to something else, and that is the “matters of the fountain” which seems to refer to something broader than the fetus, perhaps sexuality in a broader sense.
Introduction<br>Having explained how R. Nahman uses the verse R. Abahu used to prove that the bridegroom’s blessing requires a minyan, the Talmud now asks the opposite question—what does R. Abahu do with R. Nahman’s blessing?
According to R. Nahman, Boaz assembled ten men for an entirely different purpose and not so that he could recite the blessing. Rather, Boaz wanted to teach the elders that the Torah prohibits only male Ammonites and Moabites from marrying into Israel (Deuteronomy 23:4), not a female Ammonite or Moabite. This is important because Ruth, the progenitor of King David, is a Moabitess. Boaz needed a midrash to allow him to marry her in the first place.<br>To prove this point, R. Nahman points out that if all Boaz needed was a minyan, the people he assembled did not have to be elders. The fact that Boaz assembled elders means that they were there for more than just the blessing.
Abahu responds to R. Nahman’s understanding of why Boaz needed ten. If the whole point was to teach the elders the midrash that the Torah prohibits male Ammonites and Moabites from marrying into Israel but not females, then why did he need a minyan. According to R. Abahu the fact that he specifically searched for ten is proof that he did so because without ten the blessing could not be recited. Ten would not have been necessary just to teach a midrash.<br>Nahman responds that the ten were needed to publicize the halakhah that Boaz had expounded. Without ten word would not have gotten out that only male Ammonites and Moabites are prohibited. This corresponds with a statement that Shmuel makes to R. Hanna of Baghdad concerning an entirely different topic altogether. The topic is whether one can transfer ownership over something to an unborn fetus. According to Shmuel this is possible, but in the end the halakhah is that it is not. One cannot transfer ownership over a piece of property (be it an item or a field) to something that has been determined to not yet “be in the world.” We might put this another way—fetuses do not have property rights.
Introduction<br>The Talmud now turns its attention more fully to the bridegroom’s blessing, as well as the blessing recited at betrothal. We should keep in mind that while we now recite both of these sets of blessings at the huppah, meaning at the time of marriage, in the Talmudic period, there was a large gap in time between betrothal and marriage, just as there is typically a gap in time today between (secular) betrothal and marriage. Today Jews might get engaged a long time before they are married, but this engagement is not “Jewish”—it has no legal consequences. The “Jewish” betrothal takes place at the ring ceremony, minutes before marriage.
According to the first opinion, the bridegrooms’ blessing is recited only in the bridegroom’s home, when the wife moves in. This is basically the definition of marriage—the couple begins to live together.<br>Judah says that the blessing is also recited earlier, at the point of betrothal. This seems to be a bit strange—after all, they are not living together so how can they recite these blessings?<br>Abaye answers this question by saying that R. Judah’s statement refers only to the region of Judah, where as we shall see later in the chapter, there was a custom for the husband and wife to be secluded before marriage. Since this seclusion might lead to sexual relations, they should already recite the blessing when she is still in her father’s home.  But in other regions, the bridegrooms’ blessing is recited only in the bridegroom’s house.
This baraita introduces a new blessing—the blessing over betrothal. Now we can see that there are two separate blessings for two separate occasions, the betrothal and marriage. The first blessing is recited in the house in which betrothal occurs, usually her father’s house. The second blessing is recited at the bridegroom’s house, when the woman moves in.
The Talmud now relates what we say for the betrothal blessing. God prohibited us (meaning men) from having relations with women we have already betrothed. This is a main feature of Jewish marital law. During the period of betrothal, the woman is prohibited from having relations with her husband, but if she has relations with another man, it is considered adultery.<br>Women become permitted to their husbands at the point of marriage.<br>The blessing uses the curious phrase “huppah and kiddushin.” This struck some commentators as strange because the kiddushin, the act of betrothal, precedes the act of marriage, the huppah. So why are they in reverse order?<br>My doctoral advisor, Professor Shamma Friedman answered this question in an article—shorter word tends to come first in Hebrew pairs. Just sounds better!
In Jewish liturgy, some blessings are “complex” and some are “simple.” A complex blessing has an opening, “Blessed are You…” and then a closing one as well. An example of this is the first blessing after Barkhu, or the first blessing of Birkat Hamazon, or the first blessing of the Amidah. Kiddush is also an example. Simple blessings have no conclusion. All blessings over things from which one benefits, such as food and smell, are simple blessings. Blessings over mitzvoth are also simple (tallit, tefillin, shofar and many others).<br>So the one who holds that a simple blessing is used for betrothal, holds that it is like blessings over mitzvoth or over things from which we derive benefit. After all, marriage is a mitzvah and people derive benefit from it.<br>In contrast, the one who holds that it is a complex blessing says that it is like Kiddush. After all, it too uses the word “sanctification” so it really is like Kiddush.<br>Today the halakhah is that it is “complex,” like Kiddush, beginning and opening with “Blessed are You…” 
Introduction<br>Today’s section provides the text for what today is called “the sheva berakhot.” There are actually only six blessings. The blessing over the wine was added in a later period. These blessings are called in the Talmud “the bridegrooms’ blessing.” I have not commented on the meanings of the blessings. Commentary and other translations can be found in siddurim.
According to the baraita, the bridegrooms’ blessing is recited in front of ten people all week of the celebration. However, Rav Judah notes that this is true only if new guests come. If there are no new guests at a subsequent night, then the blessing is not recited.

Daf 8a

Introduction<br>Today’s section deals with some laws concerning the sheva berachot, specifically how many blessings are recited, and for how long is the special invitation to birkat hamazon at a wedding feast recited.
Here we have a dispute over how many blessings the “bridegrooms’ blessings” consist of. According to Rashi, whose commentary is based on the continuation of the sugya, the dispute is whether the second blessing, “Who forms man” is included. We should note that if it is included, then there seems to be a repetition in the second and third blessings. Both seem to say the same thing—acknowledging God for creating humanity.
Levi who blesses five, would hold that God created (formed) only one human being, a two-sided figure, and then split that being in half, male and female. This is a well-known version of creation that appears not only in rabbinical literature, but in Plato as well. Since there was only one formation, only one blessing is recited.
The Talmud now says that both R. Assi and Levi believed that human beings were created only once. So how do we understand the discrepancy in the verses, one implying that God created one human being, and then another, and the other verse implying that God created two from the outset. The answer is that God originally intended to create a separate male and female. But in the end, it turned out that God created one human being, and then later separated them.<br>There are clearly deep theological and anthropological implications to this passage. Why wasn’t God’s original intent fulfilled? Why did God want to create the sexes separately? What does this teach us about human beings that they were created at the same time?
Rav Ashi now outlines a procedure for signifying through blessings how long into the wedding celebration we are. We should note that the periodization here is similar to that in mourning. The most intense period is the first week, after that the next thirty days, and then as well shall see the next period is twelve months.<br>The blessing “In whose dwelling there is joy” is today recited as part of the zimmun, the invitation to birkat hamazon. After the wedding, the sheva berachot are recited as part of birkat hamazon and not independently.<br>The customs reflected in this passage are no longer observed. Today, we recite all the sheva berakhot for the first seven days, but only if there are new guests. After the seventh day, no one recites any of these special blessings anymore. The special zimmun for birkat hamazon is recited for seven days, but not longer.
Ashi did not give an upper limit with regard to how long the special blessing, “In whose dwelling there is joy” can possibly recited. R. Papi limits its recitation to a year. This is also the maximum time of mourning.
The question here is when do they begin saying this special blessing, “In whose dwelling there is joy” begin. At first Rav Papa answers that we begin saying the blessing when “they put barley in the mortar.” Rashi offers two explanations. The first is that this refers to making some sort of beer from the barley. This would be the first preparation for the wedding. I should note that Rav Papa was known to be a brewer. The second explanation is that they would plant barley in a pot as a symbol of “be fruitful and multiply.” Nice custom, although I might prefer the beer!<br>The problem is that Rav Papa, when preparing for his own son’s wedding, would say the blessing earlier, from the time of betrothal.<br>The answer is that Rav Papa was sure that all the preparations for the wedding were already made. Therefore, he could say the blessing earlier. In other cases, the blessing should not be recited till the preparations are made. Today, since betrothal and the wedding both take place under the huppah, no special blessing is made until then.
Here we can see the problem with reciting the blessing too early. Ravina said the blessing at the time of betrothal, claiming that he was certain that they would not retract. In the end, they did retract and annul the betrothal. It seems that he was testing luck.
Rav Tahlifa said six blessings, but made them all long. The difference between this practice, and that described above comes in the first two blessings. In the above version these were short blessings, opening with “Blessed are You,” but without any “Blessed are You” conclusion. In contrast, Rav Tahlifa lengthened them both, opening and ending them with “Blessed are You.” The halakhah does not follow Rav Tahlifa. The first two blessings are short blessings.<br>We can see here that the precise text of the “bridegrooms’ blessing” was still fluid during the Talmudic period. From other evidence (the Tosefta, and some post-talmudic works), we also know that in Eretz Yisrael they recited three blessings. In general blessings and other parts of the liturgy were not yet all standardized in the Talmudic period.
 Rav Habiba recited this blessing even at the house of a circumcision. But the anonymous Talmud rejects this, saying that a circumcision is not unadulterated joy. The child experiences pain, and therefore we do not say, “In whose dwelling there is joy.” 
Introduction<br>Today’s section discusses whether the bridegroom or mourner counts towards the minyan (quorum of ten) necessary to recite the bridegrooms’ blessing or the mourner’s blessing. Note that the Talmud is now transitioning to a discussion of both wedding customs and mourning customs. There are indeed many, many parallels between the two. I have a whole book at home on the topic. Clearly the rabbis shaped the two intentionally to have so many similarities. In this way, the two most critical moments in a person’s existence, marriage and death, are parallel.
According to the early amoraic sage, Rav, while bridegrooms count towards the minyan required to recite the special blessings, the mourners do not.<br>However, a baraita says that in both cases, they count towards the minyan.<br>The Talmud resolves this difficulty by noting that Rav is different from all other amoraim. For the most part, the Talmud holds that amoraim may not disagree with tannaim. If they do, they must find some way to resolve the difficulty (this is what usually happens). No resolution and the amora loses (rare, but it does occur). However, Rav lived right at the beginning of what is considered the amoraic period. He is therefore considered a tanna and may disagree with other tannaim.
This is the same statement and difficulty from above. Again, the amora says that mourners do not count in the minyan, whereas the baraita cited as a difficulty says that they do.<br>This time, the difficulty must be resolved. The mourners count when it comes to the minyan required to recite the special birkat hamazon for mourners (we will read more about this later). But when it comes to the line after the funeral in which mourners are comforted, they do not count. This seems to make intuitive sense. In the line, the mourners are separate from the comforters. Therefore, they do not count. But at the meal, the mourners eat just as those giving comfort eat. Therefore, the mourners count.

Daf 8b

Above we said that R. Yohanan does not require a minyan of mourners only at the line of comforters. The problem is that here he refers to the blessing for the mourners, and this blessing is not recited in the line of comforters.<br>Therefore, the Talmud adjusts the above resolution. R. Yohanan refers to the blessing recited in the plaza. According to Rashi, this refers to the first meal fed to the mourner after the funeral. They would do this in the town square. At this occasion, mourners do not count in the minyan.
Finally, we have yet another statement by R. Yohanan. Here he refers to the blessing said over the mourners all seven days. Above, we said that this blessing does not require a minyan when in the plaza. The problem is that this blessing done only during the first day.<br>The Talmud answers that there could be a blessing in the plaza for seven days if new guests come.<br>I should note that this is clearly a resolution of the Talmud. The meal/blessings in the plaza were done only during the first day, upon returning from the funeral. This is an excellent example of the Talmud’s propensity to “make things up” even when they don’t match reality.
Introduction<br>The story in this section is mainly a eulogy offered for the child of R. Hiyya bar Abba. I warn you, the eulogy does not contain the kind words you might expect on such an occasion. This story begins a series of “derashot” offered by a person who seems to be a professional eulogizer. It seems that these eulogies are not tailored to each individual who dies, but are more like stock poetic remarks to offer at a funeral depending. At most they are slightly tailored to the circumstance. Eulogies were important in the Talmudic period, but they were conducted very differently from how they are done today, at least in the traditions I’m familiar with from the western world.
Resh Lakish, the father of the student of R. Hiyya bar Abba does not go to comfort R. Hiyya on the first day of his mourning. It is not clear why not. The next day, Resh Lakish shows up with his “meturgaman.” Sometimes this means “translator” but here it clearly refers to a professional eulogizer. Resh Lakish tells the unnamed eulogizer to say something about the child who has just died.
The meturgaman opens with a verse and then offers a midrash on this verse to explain why R. Hiyya bar Abba’s son died. God was angry over the sins of the generation.<br>Obviously, the theology expressed here is troublesome to our modern minds (and to the Talmud, as we shall see below). But I’d like to focus more on the form of the eulogy. First of all, it is extremely short. It is basically just a verse, and a short interpretation. Second, clearly the meturgaman does not know the child, and maybe not even the family. This seems to be more of a formal lament, than what we would today term a eulogy. I understand that we today would not want our or our loved one’s eulogies conducted in this manner. What is interesting to me is to look at the record of how they did this in the past.
This is a second version of the “eulogy” which seems to fit the case better if the son of R. Hiyya that died was a “young man” and not a child. The verse from Isaiah specifically mentions “young men” and blames the person himself for his own sins, and not the fathers, as was the previous “eulogy.” Again, it seems to me that this is a stock eulogy. Scholars say that in the past people tended to have less of an individual identity. People were simply part of a group. I do not know if this is always true, but these eulogies do seem to express that world view. The eulogy is not personal, it matches the person’s age and to a certain extent the circumstances of their death. But that’s it. The eulogizer says nothing about the person’s life. Today in the age of individuality, we would of course expect the eulogy to address the unique aspects of the person who passed away.
Before discussing the eulogy itself, the Talmud interprets the phrase “His hand is still stretched out.” This implies that God’s judgment is still hanging. Even if a person’s fate has already been sealed in the books of heaven, things could still go wrong.<br>What is it that a person could do to overturn his good judgement? According to this sugya, it is something as trivial as saying explicitly why the bride is going into the bridal chamber. Everybody knows what is to happen there, but this is a private matter. [If you don’t know what happens in the bridal chamber, I am not saying. I don’t want my decree overturned!]. The wedding in essence is a public celebration of something that should be a private matter between a husband and wife. The rabbis were concerned that the private aspects remain as such.
The Talmud questions the content of the meturgaman’s eulogy—how could he be so crass as to say to R. Hiyya bar Abba that your son died because of your sins?<br>The answer is that only the righteous (and their families) are punished for the sins of their generations. I’m not sure how comforting this may be to R. Hiyya bar Abba, but at least he is not saying that his own son died because of his father’s sins.
Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section, Resh Lakish’s professional meturgaman delivered a eulogy for the child who had died. The meturgaman, who seems to be a professional liturgist/poet, is now asked to recite other formal blessings customarily recited at the home of a mourner.<br>I should note that there is a rich history to these blessings, either as part of a special birkat hamazon said at the home of a mourner, or as independent blessings. These blessings are no longer recited. They seem to have been lost at some point during the period of the geonim (post-Talmudic period, roughly 700-1100 C.E.).
The first blessing after the eulogy is about God’s greatness. We should note that this is parallel to the first blessing of birkat hamazon, where we bless God for providing food. God is great for sustaining the people of this world, and for the resuscitation of the dead.
This blessing is about the mourners, offering them comfort for their bereavement. This blessing has some affinities with the third blessing of birkat hamazon, in which we mourn the loss of Jerusalem. Indeed, there are other texts that combine these two ideas—comforting the people over their personal loss, as well as their national loss for Jerusalem.
Abaye says that one should not “open one’s mouth to Satan” by acknowledging that death will continue to occur. Abaye wants to mourn the loss of the individual but to a certain extent deny death, by hoping that death will cease occurring.
The final blessing in these series is for those who comfort the mourners. Again, we can see some similarities between this blessing and the fourth blessing of birkat hamazon. The fourth blessing focuses on reward, “He rewarded us, He rewards us and He will reward us.” It is not hard to imagine how these two blessings could be combined together.<br>The blessing mentions Abraham who is considered in Jewish lore the father of acts of loving kindness. 
Introduction<br>Today concludes the last of the blessings recited at the mourner’s home.
In this last blessing we ask God to save us from all sorts of catastrophes. The liturgy is similar to the words used in other blessings, including the “birkat haderekh” the travelers’ blessing.
Ulla cites a baraita according to which they drank ten (!) cups of wine at the home of a mourner. Six cups were functional—to ease digestion. Four more were drunk after the meal, one corresponding to each of the blessings of the birkat hamazon.
As if ten cups of wine were not sufficient, according to the baraita, they added four more! The additional cups were in honor of various functionaries in the city, as well as Rabban Gamaliel. Alas, fourteen cups was determined to be too much, so they went back to only ten cups of wine. (Reminds me of the old joke about the rabbi who instructed the man to bring the animals into his house. Ten cups doesn’t look like so much in comparison with fourteen).
The Talmud explains the reference to Rabban Gamaliel—what is his connection with Jewish funerals? The answer is that Rabban Gamaliel is the sage who began the wise practice to limit the costs of a funeral. Before his time, burial had become an opportunity for people to show off their wealth. The costs of the funeral became so burdensome that people began abandon their dead. Rabban Gamaliel did not just tell the people to cease this practice. He directed that his own funeral should be simple, and that he should be buried in simple shrouds. Jewish funerals were never the same.<br>Interestingly, just last week a group that deals with Jewish burial and mourning practices all over the world came to visit the Yeshiva. The name of the group? Gamaliel.

Daf 9a

Introduction<br>After a long digression about the blessings recited at weddings and funerals or homes of mourners, the Talmud now returns to the main subject of the chapter: virginity and virginity claims.<br>I wish to remind the reader that I adopt a clinical tone when discussing these passages. I try to offer an accurate description of what I believe the rabbis are talking about. The immediate topic of these passages, virginity claims, is not practical halakhah anymore, nor was it observed very much throughout Jewish history. But the abstract principles discussed over the next few pages were of great interest to Talmudic thinkers for many generations, and made this one of the most learned pieces of Talmud in the entire Bavli.
Rabbi Elazar refers to a completely subjective type of virginity claim, according to which the husband simply says that his wife did not feel to him like she was a virgin. This is different from the virginity claim referred to in the Torah and in earlier rabbinic literature, which was a claim based on the lack of blood.<br>We should note that Rabbi Elazar also refers to a consequence of a virginity claim that we have never heard of before—the wife is prohibited to the husband. The Mishnah spoke about her losing her ketubah payment (200 for a first marriage). In other words, the tannaim referred to a claim that was in the realm of financial matters, whereas the amoraim discuss the issue in terms of personal/religious consequences.<br>What Rabbi Elazar seems to be saying is that if a husband does not have the evidence to successfully prove that his wife was not a virgin, i.e. he does not have any evidence to prove that she did not bleed, but he still believes that she is not a virgin due to his subjective feeling, he may not continue to live with her, for we fear that she was an adulteress. This too is a shift from the halakhah in the Mishnah and in the Torah. In the earlier texts the problem with her not being a virgin was simply that the husband thought he was marrying a virgin. To put it crudely, he imagined he was buying a virgin, and he got a non-virgin, and therefore he wants his money back. Rabbi Elazar introduces a new fear—that she had sex with a man besides her husband after she was already betrothed.
The Talmud points out that there are two possible reasons considered by her husband not to have been a virgin at the time of marriage is still permitted to him.<br>The first is that she may have had sex with another man before she was betrothed. This would mean that she is still permitted to her husband because she is not an adulteress. Only an adulteress is prohibited to her husband, not a woman who had premarital sex.<br>Second, even if she had sex once betrothed, she may have been raped and is therefore not an adulteress. A woman raped is not prohibited to her husband, as long as he is an Israelite.<br>Since there is a “double doubt” the halakhah should rule leniently and allow this man to stay with his wife, even though he believes her not to be a virgin.
There are two possible cases where there is not a double doubt with regard to her being prohibited to him, and therefore, Rabbi Elazar’s rule would apply.<br>The first case is if she is married to a priest (Kohen). A kohen may not stay married to his wife if she has been raped. Therefore, we are left with only one doubt—was it after or before betrothal?<br>The second case is where she was betrothed before she was three years old. In this case, even if she had been raped before three, the rabbis believed that her physical signs of virginity would return. Therefore, if her husband senses that she is not a virgin, we can be sure that she lost her virginity after betrothal. We are now left with only one doubt—was it rape or was it willing adultery?<br>As I stated in the introduction above, the actual halakhah here is not what interested Talmudic commentators. What interested them far more was the principle—what do we do in cases of doubt? One principle we learn here is that if there are two doubts, the law can be lenient.<br>I should also note that throughout these passages, the woman does not explain or otherwise respond to her husband’s claim that she was not a virgin. There are some stories coming up later where she does respond. But in the abstract halakhic discussions, we do not know her response.
Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section Rabbi Elazar stated that a man who believes that his wife was not a virgin when they first had sex, is believed to cause her to be prohibited to him.<br>In a somewhat strange twist, after criticizing Rabbi Elazar for being wrong, the Talmud now criticizes him for being “too right.”
The Talmud believes that the same principle taught by Rabbi Elazar can be derived from this Mishnah. In this Mishnah, a man says to a woman “I betrothed you” but she denies that the betrothal occurred. The consequence of this statement is certainly not that she is betrothed—after all, she denied that it was true. Rather, the consequences are for him alone. He may not marry any of her close relatives, for according to him, he betrothed this woman. This is the same principle as that which underlies Rabbi Elazar’s statement—a man can say something and cause a woman to be prohibited to him based on his word alone.<br>She on the other hand is not prohibited from marrying his relatives because she says they were never betrothed.
If Rabbi Elazar had not stated his rule, that a man is believed to say “I found an open opening,” we might have said that he is believed only when he says “I betrothed you” because we can assume that about such a matter he is certain. After all, he knows what he said. But whether she was a virgin or not is subjective; he knows what he felt, but he cannot possibly know if his assessment was correct. Therefore, we might have said he is not believed in that case. Therefore, Rabbi Elazar says that he is believed.
Introduction<br>The Talmud now questions whether Rabbi Elazar actually said that if a husband says “I found an open opening,” i.e. he believes his wife was not a virgin at marriage, she becomes prohibited to him.
The Talmud cites another statement by Rabbi Elazar that seems to contradict the “open opening” statement. Rabbi Elazar refers to the laws of the sotah, the suspected adulteress. According to the rabbis, for a woman to become a sotah, and for her to be brought to the Temple to drink the bitter waters, the husband must perform two preliminary actions. First of all, he must warn her not to be secluded with a particular man. Second, she must be secluded with that man. This, according to Rabbi Elazar, is like “the occurrence that happened,” which is assumed later on in this section to be a reference to the episode of David and Bathsheba. This episode is so scandalous, that the rabbis don’t even want to refer to it by name.
This is not a difficulty, for thus he means to say: A wife does not become forbidden to her husband except in the case of warning and seclusion, [and this we learn] from the occurrence that happened, where there was no warning and seclusion and therefore she was not prohibited.<br>Before going on with the larger difficulty, the Talmud asks about this statement itself. The problem is that the story of David and Bathsheba did not have anything to do with warning and seclusion, and moreover, Batsheba did not become prohibited to David after. The sentence as it stands makes no sense.<br>To resolve this difficulty, the Talmud emends the statement. The reason that Bathsheba did not become prohibited to David was that it was not a case of “warning and seclusion.” [This is entirely absurd—David was not married to Bathsheba, and therefore could not possibly have warned her. What would he have said? Don’t be secluded with me?].
The Talmud now turns to the original difficulty. Here Rabbi Elazar seems to say that the only way a woman can become prohibited to her husband is through a process of warning and seclusion. We could deduce from here that if a husband says, “I found an open, opening” he would not be believed to prohibit her to him.<br>But this exclusionary interpretation of this statement is absurd. If witnesses come and testify that a woman has committed adultery, it is obvious that she is prohibited to him. So how could we possibly think to say that she becomes prohibited only through warning and seclusion?<br>The Talmud therefore revises the statement (yet) again. One witness as to a woman’s adultery is not sufficient for her to become prohibited to her husband. However, if he warns her and she is secluded, she is prohibited to him even if the seclusion was seen by only one witness. Finally, if he himself claims to have found “an open opening” she is prohibited as if two witnesses saw her commit adultery.
Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section we learned about the “occurrence that happened” which according to commentators is the incident of David and Bathsheba. Generally speaking an adulteress is prohibited from marrying the man with whom she committed adultery. The question, and it’s not an easy one, is why was Bathsheba not prohibited to David. After all, she was an adulteress and she should not, according to rabbinic law, be allowed to become married to David.<br>I should put this question into perspective. In the Bible while David certainly committed two grave sins (murder and adultery) he was not punished, probably because he is God’s chosen king. The rabbis, though, have to justify David with rabbinic halakhah. This is no easy feat, as we shall see.
The first answer to this question is not an easy one to read. An adulteress is prohibited from remaining married to her husband. But a woman who is raped is not an adulteress and is not prohibited from her husband. She did nothing wrong. Here, and only here, we read of a corollary—just as a raped woman is permitted to stay married to her husband, she is permitted to marry her rapist (I understand that she would not want to, but technically this would be permitted). So if David raped Bathsheba, he could still marry her.<br>Obviously, this is morally repulsive and also difficult to accord with the simple reading of the Bible. There is little evidence that David raped Bathsheba, beyond the general consideration that the king is powerful and it is not possible for women to refuse him. Indeed, to my knowledge there are no other places in rabbinic literature where the incident is portrayed as rape. Nevertheless, this allows the rabbis to solve the halakhic conundrum of how David was allowed to marry Bathsheba.

Daf 9b

This second interpretation is more normative. David was allowed to marry Bathsheba because Uriah had divorced her before going into battle. This midrash is reflective of the rabbinic halakhah that soldiers should divorce their wives before going to battle. This would prevent her from becoming an “agunah” should he die and his whereabouts not be known. Thus Bathsheba was not married when David had relations with her. Elsewhere the rabbis find ways to justify his murder of Uriah.
Introduction<br>In this section Abaye tries to bring tannaitic support for R. Elazar’s rule that one who says, “I found an open opening” is believed.
Abaye quotes the Mishnah with its Talmudic explanation. A virgin is married on Wednesday so that a husband can get to the court before his anger at her for not being a virgin has cooled off.
Who cares if he cools off, asks the Talmud? What negative result might happen by his anger subsiding and his not making a virginity claim against her?<br>If the issue is financial, meaning we fear that he will not go to the court to protest paying her the ketubah, why should we care about this? Let him give her the ketubah, even if she is really undeserving of it because she was not a virgin. A person can always give his money to whomever he so wishes.<br>Rather, the issue must be to cause her to be prohibited to him. We fear that he will cool down and stay with her even though she might be prohibited to him, because she committed adultery after marriage.
The final element that Abaye needs to prove is that this Mishnah refers to a husband who claims “I found an open opening.” There is simply no evidence that the Mishnah refers to such a situation. Rather, it could easily refer to the more normative claim a husband might make, that he did not find blood. Therefore, in the end the Mishnah is not proof that R. Elazar’s rule is correct.
Introduction<br>In this sugya we read the Babylonian version of R. Elazar’s law. A man who says that he found “an open opening” is believed to cause his wife to lose her ketubah. We should note what a dangerous and problematic law this would be. A husband could make a purely subjective claim, based on no evidence, and use it to cause his wife to lose her ketubah, the money he guaranteed her at the wedding. This law was greatly hedged in later halakhic literature, especially in a series of stories we shall see in the next daf.
Rav Judah and Shmuel are Babylonian amoraim. They take R. Elazar’s rule a step further. Not only is the husband believed to cause his wife to be prohibited to him, he is even believed to cause her to lose her ketubah.
Rav Joseph cites a Mishnah that he believes states the same rule as Rav Judah, making it superfluous. The Mishnah rules that if a husband eats at his father in law’s house before the marriage, he loses the right to make a virginity claim because he was secluded with her. We will learn this Mishnah in a couple of pages. For now, he uses it to prove that while one cannot make a virginity claim in Judea, he can make it in the Galilee, which here is a code word for all other places.
As we did in yesterday’s section, the Talmud now asks what the effectivity of this claim is. If it is just to prohibit her to him, then why can’t he make such a claim in Judea? After, all, a husband should always be able to claim that his wife is prohibited to him and then separate from her. Indeed, if he thinks she is prohibited to him, he can just separate from her and that’s it.<br>Therefore, it must be that this Mishnah refers to a husband making a virginity claim to cause her to lose her ketubah. Such a claim is effective in the Galilee, or anywhere else besides Judea.
For this Mishnah to teach the same rule as Rav Judah, the husband must be making a claim of “I found an open opening.” But again, there is no evidence that this is the husband’s claim in the Mishnah. Rather, it is far more likely that he is making the claim we hear about in the Mishnah all of the time, the claim of no blood. There is no evidence that Rav Judah’s rule is found in the Mishnah.

Daf 10a

Introduction<br>Today’s section tries to find support for why a husband should be believed when he states that he found “an open opening.”
Rav Nahman points out that it was the rabbis who determined that a woman should receive a ketubah, 200 for a virgin, 100 for a second time marriage. Since they enacted that she should get the money in the first place, they can shape the law such that if a husband claims that he found his wife not to be a virgin, he is believed. In other words, the rabbis giveth and the rabbis taketh away.<br>I should note that this is in essence like saying, “that’s just the way it is” to an irrational law. A husband should not simply be believed to say that his wife is not a virgin. Since he is causing her a loss of money, he should have to bring evidence, as is always the case in civil suits. After all, there is ample reason for why he would lie.
This section offers a better explanation of why the husband is believed. It begins by questioning why the rabbis enacted the ketubah just to allow it to be taken away.<br>In Talmudic times the husband would have paid for the wedding feast. A husband would not have spent this huge amount of money just to go and falsely libel his wife by claiming that she was not a virgin. Therefore, when he makes this claim, he is believed.<br>We should of course note that this is an assumption. Some husbands might indeed lie about their wives, despite the fact that this will cause them to lose their expenditures on the wedding feast. Nevertheless, it does at least point to a factor in the equation. The husband has spent a large amount of resources in making this wedding happen. The assumption that he would not just throw it away does have some legal weight.
Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section the claim was made that the rabbis enacted the ketubah, the marriage document that guarantees a woman money at the time of her divorce or her husband’s death. Today’s section questions the source of the ketubah—is it from the Torah or is it a rabbinic enactment.
A baraita states that since a ketubah is a fine, a sort of penalty on the husband, if he pays out this money, he may give her from the worst land on his property. This is the general rule with rabbinic fines/enactments—they may be paid out from the worst type of land. In contrast, debts would have to be paid out of higher quality land and damages would need to be paid out of the best land.<br>The Talmud emends “fine” to “enactment.” A ketubah is not a fine, it is an enactment of the rabbis, or at least so it was claimed in yesterday’s section.<br>In contrast, Rabban Shimon b. Gamaliel holds that it is from the Torah. The Talmud will now explore this opinion.
The verse from Exodus refers to case where a man has seduced a virgin—he slept with her without first marrying her with her father’s permission. The Torah rules that the husband must pay her the “bride-price” of the virgins, which in Deuteronomy corresponds to 50 shekels. Since the Torah’s shekel is believed to be worth four dinars in rabbinic/Roman money, this is considered the source of the amount of the ketubah, 200 dinars. The rabbis from here say that this is also support for the notion that the ketubah, the marriage document, is of “deoraita”—toraitic—status.<br>Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says that the status of the ketubah is “from the scribes” elsewhere known as “derabanan.”<br>I should note that the issue of the source of the ketubah is complex. People were getting married with marriage documents for thousands of years before the rabbinic period. The Torah certainly did not invent the notion of the ketubah. And clearly the amount of the rabbinic ketubah is derived from the Torah’s fifty shekels. The argument here seems to be an issue of legal status, not an issue of origins.<br>In any case, this baraita contradicts the earlier baraita, in which Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said that the ketubah was from the Torah.
To solve the difficulty the Talmud reverses the opinions in the second baraita, such that Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel holds that the ketubah is from the Torah in both baraitot.<br>However, the Talmud asks why reverse the opinions in the second baraita—why not reverse the opinions in the first baraita such that they accord?
The answer is that there is yet another source that implies that Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel holds that the ketubah is from the Torah. In a Mishnah found at the end of this tractate R. Shimon ben Gamaliel says that if a man marries a woman in Cappadocia (in modern Turkey) but then divorces her in Israel, he must pay Cappadocian coins, which the Talmud believes to be worth more than coins from Israel. This is because R. Shimon ben Gamaliel holds that the ketubah is from the Torah, and therefore he must pay the debt he incurred in the place where he incurred it, as is the case with all debts. If the ketubah was of derabanan status, he would have been able to pay her with the lesser currency.
This is an alternative resolution. Instead of switching the baraita’s opinion, the Talmud emends the whole thing, such that it is all the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel. Instead of him saying that the ketubah is derabanan, he adds that the ketubah for a widow (or any second marriage) is only from the scribes—it is of derabanan status.
Introduction<br>We now begin a most fascinating series of stories of men coming in front of rabbis with virginity claims against their wives. Most interesting is that in none of these cases does the man “win” the case. He always loses, although in various ways. In my opinion this is often the function of aggadah—to balance out the halakhah. The halakhah increasingly believed men who made virginity claims. This may have functioned to deter women from losing their virginity before marriage, at least in the eyes of the rabbis. On the other hand, actually believing husbands is a dangerous thing, for a husband could lie just to get his wife to lose her ketubah. Therefore, these stories serve as precedents that a judge could use to have some flexibility with which to rule against the husband.
As a response to the man’s claim that he found an “open opening” R. Nahman directs the man be beaten with palm branches. The only way the husband could have acquired such knowledge of sexual matters was to learn from prostitutes. Such a man deserves to be beaten.<br>Note what a deterrent to making a virginity claim this would have been. Sure, come make your virginity claim, but run the risk of being beaten.
The problem is that R. Nahman himself had said that a husband who makes a virginity claim is believed.<br>There are two answers to this. The first is that he is believed, but that they also lash him. This would seem to mean that there is still a significant deterrent to making the claim.<br>The second answer is based on R. Nahman’s assumption that he gained his sexual experience with prostitutes. This would be true only for a young man, assumedly a virgin. If he was married, then he could have gained his experience legally, in which case he is believed and he is not lashed.
This time a man comes in front of Rabban Gamaliel, again claiming that he found an “open opening.” Using a parable Rabban Gamaliel accuses him of “moving aside.” This is an activity that was alluded to earlier in the chapter, whereby a man can have sex without causing his wife to lose her virginity. Here, Rabban Gamaliel seems to be saying maybe the man did this accidentally. In my opinion, what he is really asking the husband is, how do you know what you did? You have no clue what a “closed” or “open” door really feels like. You are a man walking in the darkness. Clearly, Rabban Gamaliel is rejecting his claim.

In this story the husband makes a different sort of virginity claim—he did not find blood. The wife responds by denying his claim. Rabban Gamaliel washes the sheet that seems to have no blood on it, and discovers, lo and behold, that there is indeed blood on the sheet. Again, the husband’s claim is denied, but this time he can go home assured that his wife was indeed a virgin.
In an interesting tag to the story, Huna Mar, a Babylonian rabbi, wants to enact this test in Babylonia. R. Ashi rejects this possibility, basically claiming that the laundry process in Babylonia will either not reveal the blood at all or totally remove it.<br>We should note that R. Ashi’s response now implies that virginity claims such as these could not be made at all in Babylonia. The problem is that if the wife claims that she was a virgin, there might be blood on the sheet that cannot be revealed. Thus R. Ashi has successfully denied the possibility of virginity claims in Babylonia.

Daf 10b

Introduction<br>Today’s section continues with stories in which a husband makes a virginity claim against his wife in front of a rabbi. Again, in all three cases, his claim is rejected.
This may be one of the stranger stories in the Talmud. Rabban Gamaliel enacts here a virginity test, assuming that there is a channel directly from the bottom of the body to the top. If the woman was a virgin, the opening would be sealed and the smell of wine would not waft through her.<br>Importantly, in my opinion, despite the strange nature of the test, the man again loses his virginity claim. His wife is found to be a virgin and the couple are sent on their way.<br>The Talmud then asks why Rabban Gamaliel had to go through the test with the handmaidens. If this is a “scientific” method, why not just check her right away. The answer is telling—this is not such a scientific method. Rabban Gamaliel needed to prove its effectiveness before testing it out for real.<br>I’ve often wondered whether this whole “test” was an elaborate set-up to prove to the gullible husband that his wife is a virgin. Rabban Gamaliel would make sure that he has ready two handmaids, one whose breath smells of wine, and one whose breath does not. The husband would believe this to be science, and he would go home with his wife. In this way, Rabban Gamaliel would bring peace between a husband and his wife.
In this case, the woman claims that she is from a family, known as “Dorkati” whose women do not bleed—neither menstrual blood nor virginal blood. Rabban Gamaliel checks with her family and finds that this is true, the women of her family do not bleed. He now sends the husband on his way, telling him how lucky he is to have married into a family with this genetic quality.
The rabbis play here on the word “Dorkati” which sounds like “dor katua”—a cut-off generation. This implies that a woman who does not have menstrual blood will not be fertile. [Of course, this calls into question how such a quality could be genetic in the first place].
Two amoraim here dispute what Rabban Gamaliel said to the husband. Was marrying a woman from the “Dorkati” family a “merit” or a “liability”?<br>We can understand why it would be called a liability—R. Hanina said that such a woman is infertile.<br>But why might Rabban Gamaliel have said, “Be happy”? What is there to be happy about? The answer is that he won’t ever have to worry that he is having relations with his wife while she is menstruating. This was a serious transgression in the eyes of the rabbis, and while I think most would choose fertility, at least it is some consolation. You might say that Rabban Gamaliel was trying to find the silver lining in the situation.
In this case Rabbi [Judah Hanasi] sees that these people are just too starving to really be having sexual intercourse successfully. The wife knows that they have not successfully had sex and that she is still a virgin. Rabbi kindly orders them to be fed and bathed. They are then allowed to be intimate again, and the husband finds that his wife indeed was a virgin. I think this is a really important message for rabbis. Their job is to solve problems, to make peace. All of these rabbis could have ruled strictly. But each in their own way found a way out of the problem and a solution such that the couple could continue to live together in marriage. They would have made good marriage counsellors.
Introduction<br>Today’s section begins a new Mishnah. [Congrats, you’ve made it to the second Mishnah!]<br>The sugya on this Mishnah is really not about the Mishnah, but about a few words in the Mishnah. My commentary on the Mishnah is taken from Mishnah Yomit.
Section one:  This section provides the basic halakhah that will be discussed throughout the remainder of the chapter. Assumedly there are two reasons why a widow (which in this context includes a divorcee) receives a smaller ketubah.  First of all, she already received a ketubah from her first marriage, and therefore has some money already saved up.  Second, and probably more importantly, there was a need to encourage men to marry widows and divorcees.  Most men probably preferred first-time marriages.  Second marriages were made cheaper, therefore, to prevent older women from remaining husband-less.  Needless to say, that people should be married was an important value to the rabbis.<br>Section two:  The Mishnah now begins to discuss exceptional cases, ones which slightly deviate from the typical first marriage or the typical widow or divorcee.  If a woman has been betrothed, but then was divorced before marriage or her husband died before the marriage was completed is in one sense a virgin and in one sense not.  She is a virgin in that she has never had sexual relations, but she is a widow or divorcee as well. [Note that in Hebrew the word for virgin “betulah” can mean either a woman whose physical signs of virginity are intact or it can mean a young woman who has never been married.  The same ambiguity occurs in the Greek word, “parthenon”.]  According to our mishnah, such a woman receives a full ketubah, should she remarry.<br>A “halutzah” is a woman who has been released from levirate marriage, the obligation to marry one’s dead husband’s brother.
Hana of Baghdad makes a pun on the word “almanah” which means “widow.” It refers to the “maneh,” the one hundred zuz, that she receives for her marriage contract.<br>The rabbis now ask some nitpicky questions on what was just a play on words.<br>The problem is that sometimes a widow could receive a ketubah of more than a “maneh.” As we saw in the above Mishnah, if she is widowed before betrothal, she gets two hundred zuz, under the assumption that she is still a virgin.<br>This question is easily answered—since most widows receive a “maneh,” all widows are called “almanah.”<br>But the next problem is a little more interesting. The Torah uses the word “almanah” and yet it was the rabbis, who lived much later, who determined that a widow should receive a ketubah of a maneh. There is an anachronism here—how can the Torah use a word based on a halakhah that does not yet exist?<br>The answer is that the Torah called her “almanah” based on the fact that the rabbis will in the future give her such a ketubah.
The Talmud asks whether something can be named in the Torah based on future events. And the answer is affirmative. The Torah refers to Ashur, which R. Joseph explains as referring to the area known as Seleucia, today identified with modern Syria/Lebanon. Just as “Seleucia” is alluded to in the Torah, so is the widow’s maneh.<br>[If you think the analogy is not so great, I agree. R. Joseph is not making a pun based on future rabbinic law, as did R. Hana of Baghdad. He is simply identifying an area of the world mentioned in the Torah based on its future name, just as I identified “Seleucia” with modern Syria.]
R. Hana of Baghdad seems to have been a professional punster. Here he makes a pun on the word “matar,” one of the words for rain in the Bible. He uses five words that begin with “mem” to describe rain. We might note that it’s not hard to find “mem” words considering that one of Hebrew’s verb constructs begins with “mem.”<br>Evidently we need proof for the idea that rain helps the ground. Rava locates this in the verse from Psalms.
Introduction<br>More puns!
The word for altar, “mizbeah,” begins, conveniently, with a “mem.” R. Elazar, in the spirit of R. Hana of Baghdad, finds a bunch of mem words to describe what the altar does.<br>The Talmud again asks a somewhat nitpicky question, and answers it.
Dates are the subject of this statement—they have all of these wonderful qualities (although hopefully you don’t need them that often) all of which begin with “mem.” And the Hebrew word for dates has “mem” as its second letter.
Dates used to be used to make alcoholic beverages. Therefore, one should not eat them and then render a legal decision. Nevertheless, they have many healthy qualities as well.
The second resolution is that dates are good for one, but only after a meal, when they strengthen the body like a bar strengthens a door. Before the meal they are harsh and can cause sickness.<br>The woman Abaye refers to is usually understood to be his wetnurse. She teaches him a lot of health remedies and other such information, things that they would have probably considered “scientific” but we would consider to be “folk.”
Here a few Babylonian rabbis offer up some puns on common Aramaic words. The pun helps illuminate the meaning of the word.<br>The final pun is not really a pun; It is an Aramaic translation. The Mishnah calls a woman who is clearly a woman but never reaches puberty an “aylonit” (the word will be in a Mishnah later in the chapter). In Aramaic this word is “duchranit”—which is related to the Hebrew word “zachar” for male. An “aylonit” has male qualities and therefore is infertile.

Daf 11a

Introduction<br>Today’s section begins with a new Mishnah. The commentary on the Mishnah is from Mishnah Yomit.
In order to understand this mishnah we must understand a few things.  First of all, all of the women mentioned in this mishnah are assumed to have already had sex.  It was assumed that female captives were raped by their captors and therefore a woman who had been taken captive was assumed to no longer be a virgin.  It was also assumed that non-Jews were extremely licentious, and that they would have sex with young girls (I realize that this is extremely bigoted, but there probably was some degree of truth to it in the world in which the rabbis lived).  Therefore a woman who converted was assumed to have already had sex.  Thirdly, it was assumed that slaves were licentious or perhaps were commonly raped by their masters.  In any case, they too were categorically not considered virgins.  Seemingly all three of these types of women should have ketuboth of one maneh [=100 zuz] and their husbands should not be able to claim that they weren’t virgins, because they were married under the assumption that they were not virgins.  However, the other assumption that the mishnah makes is that if a girl is raped before the age of three, her signs of virginity will eventually heal and return [this medical assumption was not unique to the rabbis].  Therefore if these women made the transition from slave to free Jew or proselyte to Jew or from captive to being freed before the age of three, it was assumed that their virginity would return and they could be assumed to be virgins.<br>A note about the Mishnah’s references to sexual intercourse with young girls:<br>The Mishnah will occasionally reference sexual relations with young girls, even under the age of three.  I expect that this will cause discomfort to people reading the mishnah, and when I think of my own six year old daughter, this makes me queasy as well.  We would do well to realize that the Mishnah’s discussion of all legal possibilities does not imply its tacit approval of them.  The Mishnah discusses many crimes without expressing horror over them, because the Mishnah is often interested in legal consequences. The rabbis certainly did not condone sexual relations with girls this young.
The sugya opens without any connection to the Mishnah. The topic is the conversion of minors. There is a problem with the conversion of minors—how do we know that they want to convert? For an adult this is of course not a problem, but Jewish conversion is consensual. So how can it be done for a child? R. Huna innovates that it can be done by the court taking on the child’s consent.<br>If anyone is interested I wrote a scholarly paper on this subject. It can be found on academia.edu. The point of the paper was to prove that in earlier times conversion was not a process that required a court.
What you might have said? A non-Jew prefers a life without restraint because it is established for us that a slave certainly prefers a life without restraint, therefore, he teaches us that this is said only in the case of an adult who has already tasted sin, but [in the case of] a minor, it is an advantage to him.<br>The Talmud now analyzes what we would have thought had R. Huna not issued his statement. Conversion is an advantage for a person, for he joins the Jewish people. Therefore, it should be obvious that a minor can be converted in his “absence,” i.e. before he is old enough to consent. So what does R. Huna really teach us?<br>The answer is that without R. Huna’s statement we might have thought that it is not such a pure advantage to convert. After all, many things that were permitted before are now prohibited. R. Huna lets us know that this is only true for an adult who has “tasted the forbidden fruit.” For a child who does not yet know how sweet this fruit is, conversion remains an advantage.
The Talmud now mentions our Mishnah. The Mishnah referred to a minor convert. But again, we must ask, how can a minor convert? The answer could be through R. Huna’s law—on the consent of the court. This would mean that there is tannaitic support for R. Huna.<br>But this support is rejected. The Mishnah may refer to a case where the child converts with his/her parents. In such a case we don’t really need the consent of the court, for we can assume that the child would want to convert with the parents.<br>In the end, the Talmud understands R. Huna as referring to a child who converts without his parents, perhaps a foundling. In truth, it is not easy to understand how such a situation could actually arise.
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues discussing the minor convert.
Joseph adds in a giant caveat to R. Huna’s ruling about minor conversion. Minors can convert based on the consent of the court. But since they did not themselves consent to their conversion, they can reject and undo their conversion when they reach majority age (assumedly 12 or 13, although this is not stated here). This is completely sui generis in the laws of conversion. In all other cases, once one converts it cannot be undone. Once a Jew, always a Jew.
As we have seen, the Mishnah assumes that minors can convert, The Mishnah describes the ketubah received by such a minor (although there is no reason to assume that she was married as a minor). The problem is that if she receives her ketubah, and then protests against her conversion, she will in essence get the ketubah and consume its profits as a Gentile woman. Basically, what I think Abaye is really trying to say is that tannaitic sources assume that conversion is permanent. If they thought that conversion could be undone, they would not have given such a woman a ketubah.
The resolution to Abaye’s difficulty leads to an important limitation of R. Joseph’s rule. At first the Talmud says that she would receive her ketubah only on reaching majority age. But this does not solve the problem—she could still theoretically protest, revert to being a non-Jew and consume her ketubah while not Jewish.<br>As a result, the Talmud limits R. Joseph’s rule. Once she is of majority age, she can no longer protest. In essence, by not protesting, she is at that point consenting to being Jewish. There is a very limited window of opportunity in which the convert could protest.
Rava’s difficulty on R. Joseph is basically the same difficulty raised by Abaye, he just uses a different Mishnah. The Mishnah refers to the fine paid by a rapist or seducer. The fine is paid only if the girl is a virgin, but as long as she is Jewish, she receives it. The end of the list in this Mishnah (from chapter three, where it will be explained more fully) is the same as the list in our Mishnah. Again, it shows that a girl can convert while a minor. She would receive a fine because she is considered a virgin, and then she could protest on reaching majority age. Then she could consume this fine while a Gentile.
The resolution is the exact same as above.
Since both objections are basically the same, the Talmud now must ask why each amora chose to raise the difficulty from that particular Mishnah and not from the Mishnah used by the other amora.<br>Abaye could argue that the case of the fine is different, because we want the rapist/seducer to pay the fine even if she rejects her conversion. We don’t want him to be rewarded by not having to pay the fine and so we might make him pay even if she could undo her conversion later in life. So this Mishnah is a special case and we cannot use it to prove that she is limited in her ability to protest her conversion.<br>Rava would argue that the case of the ketubah is also a special case. One of the functions of the ketubah is to deter divorce. As long as she has not protested, she remains a Jew and we do not want her husband to easily divorce her. So we might say that in she receives the ketubah even though she could “undo” her Jewishness later in life. This Mishnah is not proof that her ability to protest her conversion should be limited.
Introduction<br>Today’s section really contains two mishnayot. The first discusses three types of women who don’t fit into the normal categories of virgin/non-virgin.  This is either because they have had sexual intercourse but didn’t lose their physical signs of virginity, or because they are not physically virgins, even though they never had intercourse.
There are three women mentioned in this mishnah.  The first is a young girl who had intercourse with an adult man.  As we mentioned in yesterday’s mishnah, the Sages believed that if a girl has sexual intercourse before three, her hymen will regenerate when she gets older.  Therefore, when this girl gets older she will have her physical signs of virginity, even though she has had sexual intercourse.<br>The second woman is an adult woman who had sexual intercourse with a young boy.  According to the Sages a boy less than nine years old cannot have real intercourse, such that he causes a woman to lose her virginity.  Again, this woman has her physical signs of virginity, but she has had sexual intercourse.<br>The third woman is called a “mukath etz”, literally translated as “hit by a stick”.  This refers to a woman who lost her hymen by something other than intercourse.  In our day we might say she went horseback riding.  This woman no longer has physical signs of virginity, but she has never had sexual intercourse.<br>According to Rabbi Meir, all three of these women receive a full ketubah.  According to Rabbi Meir in order to be considered a non-virgin a woman must have lost her physical signs of virginity through sexual intercourse.<br>The Sages rule that the “mukath etz” does not receive a full ketubah.  The Sages seem to define “virginity” by physicality alone:  one who does not have her physical signs of virginity is not a “halakhic” virgin and does not receive a ketubah of 200 zuz.
This next mishnah teaches the opposite cases of those taught in mishnah two.<br>Introduction<br>Section one:  The women in this mishnah have been previously married, and not merely betrothed as were the women in mishnah two.  Nevertheless, they are still virgins for their husbands divorced them or died after entering the huppah (the wedding room) before having had sexual intercourse.  Note that this could certainly occur if the woman was menstruating at the time of marriage.  The mishnah rules that although these women are physically virgins, they are halakhically considered to be non-virgins and are treated as such. Their ketubah payment in a subsequent marriage will therefore be only a maneh and not the full 200 zuz.  If their husband in a subsequent marriage marries them and finds them not to be a virgin, he cannot make a virginity claim against them.  One reason that they are considered to be non-virgins is that by definition a woman who was once married can no longer be a virgin, for the word for virgin in Hebrew implies unmarried.  A second reason is that although the woman claims to be a virgin, since she was married, we cannot assume that she is telling the truth.<br>Section two:  The women in this mishnah converted, were freed from slavery or were freed from captivity after the age of three years and one day.  Since it is assumed that in their previous state they had sexual intercourse they cannot claim to be virgins when they grow up and get married.  This is because if a girl has sexual intercourse past the age of three years her physical signs of virginity will not return.

Daf 11b

Introduction<br>This sugya deals with the status of an adult woman who had sex with a young man, one not fully capable of having intercourse. In what way is she still considered a virgin?
According to Rav, an adult woman who had sex with a young boy has the status of a “mukat etz”—literally a woman injured by a stick. This usually refers to a woman who lost her  physical virginity through some way other than sex. If an adult woman who had sex with a young boy is put in this category, then R. Meir would hold that she is still a virgin and her ketubah would be 200 zuz. The other sages would say that she is not a virgin and her ketubah would be 100 zuz.<br>Shmuel holds that the category of “mukat etz” cannot include anyone who had sex. Therefore, since sex with a young boy is not considered intercourse, then she is not even considered a mukat etz. Her ketubah would be 200 zuz, the same as any virgin.
Oshaia raises an objection against Rav from the Mishnah. Since the sages and R. Meir dispute the status of the girl injured by a piece of wood, but not the status of an adult woman who had intercourse with a small boy, the two categories must be different. Indeed, the fact that they are listed separately means that they are different. The implication is there is no such thing as a “woman injured by a stick” who actually had sexual intercourse. This accords with Shmuel.
Rava resolves the difficulty on Rava by rewording the Mishnah. All sages agree that if the girl is young (under three years old) she remains a virgin for her physical signs of virginity grow back (at least the rabbis believe that they do). But when a young boy has had intercourse with an adult woman there is a dispute whether he causes her to lose her virginity. She has the same status as a woman injured by a stick—R. Meir would hold that she is still a virgin and the other sages would say that she is not.
Introduction<br>Today’s section relates to the Mishnah where the sages and R. Meir dispute the ketubah of a woman who lost her physical signs of virginity through some means other than sexual relations—the mukat etz. R. Meir holds that she gets a full ketubah of 200, whereas the other sages say she gets only 100.
The dispute in the Mishnah is only in a case where the man knew that the woman he was marrying had lost her physical virginity. R. Meir says she is a like a “mature girl”—a girl over the age of 12 ½. For whatever reason (I’m really not sure) the rabbis considered any girl over this age to not be a virgin. Nevertheless, there is no doubt whatsoever that she receives a full ketubah. So too, argues R. Meir, does the mukat etz.<br>The Sages say that she is like a woman who had intercourse because she has no physical virginity. Therefore, she receives a ketubah of 100.<br>But, all agree that if the husband did not know beforehand that she was a mukat etz, she does not receive any ketubah at all. Rami bar Hama seems to believe that this is deception, and therefore she loses her entire ketubah.
The Talmud now explains each of the positions in the Mishnah. R. Meir says that she is like a mature girl because she has never had intercourse. To R. Meir virginity is defined by intercourse with a man.<br>The other sages compare her to a woman who had intercourse with a man because in both cases “something happened.” The rabbis define a virgin as someone who lost her physical virginity through an action of any sort. A mature girl lost her physical virginity without anything whatsoever happening to her. That is why she retains the ketubah of a virgin. But something happened to a mukat etz—therefore she is no longer considered a virgin.
Nahman objects to Rami bar Hama’s statement from a Mishnah that appears later in the chapter. The Mishnah describes a situation where the husband clearly did not know that she was a mukat etz. If all sages agreed that in such a situation she receives nothing, then what is the point in her saying “I was injured by a piece of wood.” She wouldn’t get anything anyway! The wife’s claim in this Mishnah clearly expresses the notion that she is claiming at least 100 zuz.
Rava therefore modifies our understanding of the dispute. R. Meir holds that she always gets a ketubah of 200, even if the husband did not know that she was a mukat etz. The other sages say that if the husband knew, she gets 100. If he didn’t know, she loses her ketubah entirely. Note that this means that the Mishnah in which Rabban Gamaliel, Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua debate follows R. Meir. The woman is claiming a full ketubah and the husband is claiming that she had had intercourse with a man and therefore should receive a ketubah of 100.
Introduction<br>The last section of this daf continues the discussion of a man who did not know that his wife was a “mukat etz”—a woman who had lost her virginity in some way other than sexual intercourse. In yesterday’s section Rava stated that according to the sages she loses her entire ketubah. In today’s section the Talmud concludes that he retracted that opinion.
In order to prove that Rava changed his mind the Talmud cites a sugya that begins with a baraita. The baraita discusses the case of the “motzi shem ra”—the husband who comes to the court claiming that his wife was not a virgin upon marriage. After correcting the baraita it states two possibilities. First of all, if there are witnesses that she committed adultery after betrothal, then she is an adulteress, and she is to be stoned. This is always the punishment of an adulteress (as well as the man who committed adultery with her). Second, if there are witnesses that she fornicated before she was betrothed to him, she is not an adulteress. She of course does not receive the ketubah of a virgin, but she still receives a ketubah of a maneh (100 zuz).
Sheshet deduces from this baraita that if a man marries a woman thinking she is a virgin, assuming she told him that she was, and then it turns out that she had sexual relations before betrothal, she still receives a ketubah of a maneh. In other words, despite the fact that she deceived him by telling him she was a virgin and that she had never had sex before, she still receives the ketubah she would have received anyway.
Nahman uses a Mishnah from later in the chapter to refute R. Sheshet. In the Mishnah the husband claims that she had relations with another man before marriage and therefore his acquisition was a mistake. [The woman’s admits that she had sex before the marriage, she just says it was a case of rape and it occurred after the betrothal. Thus she is claiming that she was a virgin at the time of betrothal, and that she lost her virginity against her will]. The simple meaning of this Mishnah is that she receives no ketubah whatsoever. Again, this is a case where he did not know that she was a virgin, but rather than receive a ketubah of a maneh, she receives nothing.
Sheshet already answered that difficulty in front of R. Amram and the other great sages of his generation. When that Mishnah says that his acquisition was a mistake, it does not mean that she receives no ketubah whatsoever. She receives a ketubah of a maneh. This refutes R. Nahman who claimed that the Mishnah meant she receives nothing.
Rava now turns the tables yet again and says that the words “mistaken acquisition” imply that she doesn’t receive any ketubah whatsoever. R. Nahman’s difficulty on R. Sheshet was a good difficulty. [Indeed, this does seem to be the simple meaning of the word]. But still, we now have a clash between the Mishnah and the original baraita with which the sugya opened. That baraita had stated that she receives a ketubah of 100.<br>To resolve this difficulty Rava reworks the baraita. He seems to have been justified in doing so because the original baraita was faulty to begin with. So now, instead of two lines, the baraita contains three. First of all, if she had intercourse with another man after betrothal, she is an adulteress who is stoned. This stays the same as above. If it turns out she had sex with another man before betrothal, then she loses her ketubah completely [so now the baraita agrees with the Mishnah]. She should have told him that she had had sexual relations with a man before this marriage.<br>But if it turns out that she was not a physical virgin because she lost her physical signs of virginity in some other way, then she still receives a ketubah of a maneh.
Now we see why the Talmud concluded that Rava retracted his earlier opinion, where he had stated that if the husband did not know that his wife was a mukat etz, she loses her ketubah entirely, at least according to the rabbis. Here, Rava states that she still receives a ketubah of a maneh. The Talmud believes that this is the later opinion, and that Rava had retracted the earlier statement.
Introduction<br>Today’s section is related to the section of the Mishnah that determined whether a woman who had been divorced or widowed from her first marriage but had not yet had sexual relations could still be considered a virgin for a subsequent marriage.
In this situation, it is quite clear that she did not have relations with her first husband before he died or divorced her. There are witnesses who say they did not. In reality she is still a virgin and she should be considered a virgin for her second marriage. Nevertheless, she is not considered a virgin for her second marriage because she was indeed married the first time. Once her husband brings her into his house for the sake of marriage, she is no longer considered a virgin. Since she is legally not considered a virgin, he can no longer make a virginity claim against her. This is true even if he thought that she was a virgin.

Daf 12a

Rabbah deduces from the baraita that if a man marries a woman thinking that she is a virgin, and then it turns out that she is not, she still receives a ketubah of a maneh. In this baraita the second husband heard from witnesses that she did not have relations with her first husband. He thinks that she is a virgin. And then when he finds out that she is not a virgin, she still receives a ketubah of a maneh. Rabbah thinks that this is true in all scenarios.<br>Ashi says that the baraita describes a special case, one which does not serve as a precedent for all cases. Since this woman had already been married, the second husband cannot expect that she is a virgin. Therefore, this is not a normal case of a woman who is married with the expectation that she is a virgin. In a normal case, she would not receive any ketubah.
Again the woman in this baraita is married the second time with clear proof that she did not have sexual relations with her first husband. When she turns out not to be a virgin, her ketubah remains a maneh. She doesn’t lose her ketubah. The problem, the Talmud raises, is that she may have had relations with another man after betrothal to the second husband. If she had sex with another man after betrothal, then she should be prohibited to her second husband, as are all adulteresses.<br>The Talmud resolves this problem by saying that the second husband betrothed her and then had relations with her, i.e. married her immediately. In essence this is how we conduct Jewish marriages today—the betrothal and marriage occur one right after the other. And the reason is basically the same. The betrothal period is problematic in Jewish law, for if she has relations with someone else during this period, it is considered adultery.
This is the exact same sugya as above, but taught in reference to the Mishnah, according to which a “virgin from marriage” receives a ketubah of a maneh.
The Talmud now asks what difference it makes whether the dispute between Rabbah and R. Ashi is taught in reference to the baraita or the Mishnah.<br>The difference is that in the baraita there are witnesses who explicitly state that the woman did not have relations with her first husband. Thus someone could teach the amoraic dispute in reference to the Mishnah, where it really is not known for certain whether she had relations with her first husband. It is really only her word. We could say that despite the fact that the husband seems to have believed her, he really should not have. She receives a ketubah of a maneh and he cannot make a virginity claim. R. Ashi could say that this is not a precedent for other cases. But in the case of the baraita, where there are witnesses, the husband really should have been able to cause her to lose the ketubah entirely. R. Ashi could not have stated that this case is different in reference to the baraita.<br>But the one who teaches it in reference to the baraita, where there are witnesses, would all the more so teach it in reference to the Mishnah. R. Ashi would always say that the case is different, despite the presence of witnesses.
Introduction<br>Today’s section opens with a new Mishnah. [There are a lot of complicated historical issues related to this Mishnah and the accompanying baraita. If you’re interested, I wrote a paper addressing them. The paper can be found on academia.edu.]
The usual custom in Mishnaic times was to wait for up to a year between the betrothal and the wedding.  During this time the couple were not supposed to have sexual relations.  Generally speaking, the young woman remained in her parental home during this period and the husband-to-be was elsewhere.  However, our mishnah refers to a practice in Judea, whereby the groom would “eat” at his father-in-law’s house.  This may refer to an extended stay.  If he should do so without witnesses that he was apart from his fiancee, he cannot later claim that she was not a virgin at the time of the wedding.  Once he has been alone with her, we are suspicious that he has had relations with her, and therefore he loses the right to make a virginity claim against her.
The Talmud notes that not all places in Judea have the custom for the husband to “eat” at his father-in-law’s home before the wedding. Abaye concurs. This implies that in some places in Judea a husband could still make a virginity claim. This will now be confirmed in a baraita that also implies that there are different places with different customs in Judea.
There are three sections to this baraita, each describing a custom that they had in Judea but not in the Galilee. According to the first custom, the couple would be secluded for a short amount of time before their wedding in order for him to get to know her. “To become intimate” may mean that they could have had sex, but it is not something of which we could be sure. The point of the custom was for him to get to know her a bit before the wedding.<br>The second custom was for two groomsmen to guard the couple when they enter the bridal chamber (the huppah). The point of this “guarding” is so that they do not deceive each other over matters of virginity. She should not deceive him by bringing in some bird’s blood to fake her virginity. And he should not deceive her by hiding the bloody sheet that would serve as proof of her virginity.<br>We can immediately see that the first custom differs from the second and third customs. The first custom would damage a husband’s ability to make a virginity claim, because he may have jumped the gun. The second two customs were meant to protect his ability to make a successful virginity claim and to defend her against a false claim. This supports Abaye’s claim that there are different customs in Judea.
The last clause of the baraita stated that a husband who does not observe these customs cannot make a virginity claim. But which of these customs? If it had referred to the first clause, then it should have said, “He who acted” in this way cannot make a virginity claim.<br>And if it refers to the last clause (really the last two) then it is not really the husband who acts this way. The groomsmen are those acting. The clause would be better had it read “he who was not examined” by groomsmen to make sure that he did not falsify the evidence.
Abaye and R. Ashi emend the Mishnah to read according to one of the two ways suggested above. Only Rava offers a different reading. Basically Rava holds that if a husband keeps the customs of the place where he lives, he can make a virginity claim. The second two customs would serve as guards against the first custom. But only in Judea. A husband who observes the customs of Judea in Galilee would lose his right to make a virginity claim.
Introduction<br>Today’s section begins a new Mishnah.
A widow receives a ketubah of one maneh (100 zuz) whether she was from an Israelite family or from a priestly family.  However, the court of priests demanded that virgins from priestly families receive double the normal ketubah payment.  We should remember that in this time period priestly families still formed a quasi-elite.  Furthermore, occasionally the mishnah refers to “court of priests”.  The priests may have had their own legal system, one which derived from the autonomy they had during Temple times.  Priests tended to live in the same area and intermarriage between priestly families was common.  While the Sages did not protest against the custom of the double ketubah, one can sense that the fact that the mishnah mentions that they didn’t protest, signifies some discomfort with the practice.
The Talmud opens with a baraita according to which the widow of a priest (who may herself be the daughter of a priest) receives a larger ketubah than an Israelite widow. This baraita directly contradicts the Mishnah.
Ashi solves the difficulty between the Mishnah and baraita by positing development in the history of the size of the widow of a priest’s ketubah. At first a virgin received 400 and a widow only a maneh. This caused the ratio to be off of the usual 2-1 and men treated the worth of a widow lightly. As a response, the priestly court raised the ketubah of a widow to 200. The problem now was that this amount is the same as that of a virgin Israelite. Men preferred the virgin Israelite and priestly widows were having trouble getting married. Therefore, the court restored the earlier system, even though it too was not perfect.


Daf 12b

Introduction<br>Today’s section relates to the Mishnah according to which a higher ketubah was given to a daughter of priests.
In the Mishnah we learned that the court of the priests would give a 400 zuz ketubah for a daughter of the priests who was a virgin. Shmuel understands the priests as simply being an example of any family with good lineage. He then extends the custom of giving a higher ketubah to anyone who comes from such a family.
The Talmud cites a baraita as an objection. The baraita states that the higher ketubah may be given even if a priest marries an Israelite or an Israelite marries the daughter of a priest. But from here we could infer that if neither side is of priestly stock, the higher ketubah may not be given.
The Talmud resolves the difficulty by claiming that the baraita was in the form of a “not only” baraita. What this means is that the baraita did not even need to state that in a marriage where neither side is a priest, a higher ketubah may be given. This is because neither side can claim to the other, “I am raising you up” because I am marrying lower than my “class.” Therefore, a higher ketubah can certainly be given. But I might have thought that if one side is raising up the other, that they cannot also demand a higher ketubah. Therefore, the baraita teaches us that it is allowed.<br>I want to add a short explanatory note here. In the Second Temple period being a priest would have usually entailed a high social status. It seems that the priests wanted to express their social status by increasing the minimum level of the ketubah. After the Temple was destroyed, the status of the priests gradually but not entirely, diminished. We can sense this in this sugya—Shmuel is taking some of the customs of the priests and applying them to other families of good lineage.
Introduction<br>Today’s section is a Mishnah that begins a series of debates between Rabban Gamaliel, Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua over the credibility of certain legal claims that a woman might make.  The first debates deals with virginity claims, the main topic of the chapter.
In the scenario in this mishnah, a man comes to court after the first night with his wife and claims that she was not a virgin.  She responds by admitting that she was not a virgin, but counter-claims that she had lost her virginity by being raped and that the rape had occurred after her betrothal.  Both of these claims are essential to her defense.  The fact that the intercourse took place after betrothal means that she did not deceive him by allowing him to betroth her under the false precept that she was a virgin.  The fact that she had sexual intercourse unwillingly is essential if she wishes not to be considered an adulteress.  If she had intercourse with someone other than her husband after the betrothal she would be an adulteress and as such she would not receive her ketubah.  If the court believes both of her claims, then she would receive her ketubah.  Note that the mishnah uses a metaphor for the woman:  she is a field whose top, fertile layer has been swept away, causing a loss to the man.  The comparison of women to fields or houses, as bothersome as it might be to our modern ears, is not uncommon in rabbinic literature.<br>The husband counterclaims that she had relations before betrothal, and that he acquired her under the mistaken assumption that she was a virgin.  It is unclear whether or not he wishes to pay her a ketubah of 100 or he wishes to be totally exempt from paying her a ketubah.  What is clear is that the dispute in this mishnah is financial:  she wishes to receive her full ketubah and he wishes to lessen his payment.<br>Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer rule that the woman is believed and that she receives a ketubah of 200 zuz.<br>Rabbi Joshua says she is not believed until she can bring proof to back up her words.  In order to extract her ketubah money from him she must prove that she was a virgin at the time of betrothal.<br>The Talmud will explain the underlying legal reasoning behind both of these opinions.
Introduction<br>Today’s section begins with an amoraic dispute not connected to the Mishnah.
The Talmud begins with a dispute over a case where one person (Reuven) approaches another (Shimon) claiming that the latter owes him a maneh (100 zuz). Shimon responds that he doesn’t know if he owes Reuven the money.<br>Huna and R. Judah say that since Reuven is certain that he is owed the money and Shimon is uncertain, Shimon is legally obligated to pay him the money.<br>Nahman and R. Yohanan invoke a different principle—until the case can be determined with 100 per cent certainty, no money changes hands. Since Shimon currently possesses the money, he need not pay Reuven back.
Abaye now tries to correlate R. Huna and R. Judah’s opinion with that of Shmuel stated in a different context. To understand Shmuel’s statement and how it correlates with R. Huna’s we need to first understand this Mishnah, which will appear later in this chapter. The Mishnah is the last in the series of disputes between R. Gamaliel and R. Joshua (the section with R. Joshua is not quoted here). A woman is found to be pregnant, but claims that the child was the offspring of a priest, a person of valid lineage. Rabban Gamaliel and R. Eliezer say that she is believed whereas R. Joshua says that she is not. R. Judah ruled that the halakhah follows Rabban Gamaliel.
Another amora further says to Rav Judah that Shmuel had stated that the halakhah follows Rabban Gamaliel not only in the last Mishnah of his disputes with R. Joshua, it follows him “even in the first.”<br>The Talmud now correlates the Mishnah with the amoraic dispute above. In the Mishnah, the husband said his wife had sex with another man before betrothal, and the woman says that she was raped after betrothal. The woman’s claim is “certain” for only she can possibly know what happened to her. Her husband’s claim is “perhaps”—for he doesn’t really know what happened. To Rabban Gamaliel her “certain” wins out, despite the fact that money will have to change hands—the husband will have to give her the ketubah.<br>Thus saying that the halakhah follows Rabban Gamaliel in the Mishnah is equivalent to saying that Shimon is liable to pay Reuven in the case from above.
Above, Abaye implied that R. Judah and R. Huna follow Rabban Gamaliel. The Talmud raises the corollary—R. Nahman and R. Yohanan follow R. Joshua.<br>Nahman now claims that he can draw a distinction between the Mishnah and the issue of the disputed maneh. In the Mishnah Rabban Gamaliel believes the woman because she has a “migo”—which is the Aramaic word for “since.” Here (and in many places throughout the Talmud) it has a technical sense—“Since” the woman could have a made a claim more beneficial to herself, assumedly that she is a mukat etz, she is believed when she makes the worse claim of having been raped after betrothal (such a claim means she can no longer marry a priest). When a person could have made a better claim for herself, she is believed when she makes a worse claim. However, in the case of the disputed maneh there is no possible “migo”. Reuven already made as good of a claim as he could have made.
There is an alternative reason why Rabban Gamaliel might say that the woman is believed but not the man who claims the maneh. The last certain status of the woman is that she was a virgin. All women are at some point virgins. Therefore, in a case where we do not know when her status changes, she is considered to be in her “presumptive state.” But in the case of the maneh, there is no earlier presumptive status.
The Talmud now concludes by stating that it was necessary for R. Nahman to agree with Rabban Gamaliel. Otherwise we would have a halakhic conflict, for the halakhah always follows R. Nahman in civil matters (the case of the disputed maneh is a civil matter) and in this Mishnah, as we have seen, the halakhah follows Rabban Gamaliel. In order for these two halakhot not to conflict, R. Nahman must agree with Rabban Gamaliel.

Daf 13a

Introduction<br>This week’s daf opens with a new Mishnah, continuing the disputes between the three tannaim over whether a woman is believed when she makes certain claims.
In this case, when the husband comes to court claiming that his wife was not a virgin, the woman responds that she did not lose her physical signs of virginity through sexual intercourse but rather by “being struck by a piece of wood”, meaning she lost her hymen in some other way.  According to Rabbi Meir (whose opinion we learned in an earlier mishnah) if the court believes her, she would receive a full ketubah of 200. According to the Sages she receives a ketubah of 100.  In any case, she is claiming that she does receive some ketubah.<br>The man responds that she lost her virginity by having engaged in sexual intercourse.  The phrase “trampled by a man” is an illustrative means of saying that she had sex with a man and not that she lost her virginity from a “stick”.  Assumedly his goal is to not pay her any ketubah.<br>Again Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer rule in her favor.  The same reason which applied in the previous Mishnah applies here:  since she is certain and he is uncertain, she is believed.<br>Similarly, Rabbi Joshua holds that she is not believed, and that the money remains with the husband.  Again, the same reason as in the previous Mishnah applies:  in order for her to extract money she must provide proof.
The question is what is each side in the Mishnah claiming? We have already seen some disputes as to what ketubah a mukat etz receives, so we need to interpret this Mishnah in light of those disputes. Clearly this Mishnah is a case where the husband did not know beforehand that she was a mukat etz. Nevertheless, she is claiming some type of ketubah.<br>Yohanan says that she is asking for a ketubah of two hundred zuz, whereas the husband wants to pay her 100. This follows R. Meir’s opinion that a mukat etz is considered a virgin and receives a ketubah of 200, whether he knew she was a mukat etz or not.<br>Elazar says she is asking for a ketubah of 100, whereas her husband does not want to pay her any ketubah whatsoever. This follows the rabbis who hold that she receives a ketubah of 100, whether he knew she was a mukat etz or not.
Elazar can answer this in the following way. The first Mishnah is to exclude R. Hiyya b. Abin who held that even if the husband presumed she was a virgin and it turns out she is not, she still receives a ketubah of a maneh. That Mishnah taught explicitly that she receives no ketubah, because the husband says, “my acquisition was a mistake.” The second Mishnah excludes the opinion of Rami b. Hama who held that if the husband did not know she was a mukat etz, she receives no ketubah whatsoever. The fact that she claims she was a mukat etz in this Mishnah obviously means that she is claiming at least 100.<br>That works for R. Elazar. But R. Yohanan agrees with R. Hiyya b. Abin. So why does he need two mishnayot?
Yohanan would explain the need for two mishnayot based on the legal principle of “migo” which, as we have seen, means that when one makes a lesser claim despite the possibility of making a better claim, the lesser claim is believed. In the first Mishnah, the woman had a “migo”—she could have said “I am a mukat etz” instead of saying that, she says she was raped after betrothal. This is a worse claim because it disqualifies her from a marrying a priest. Nevertheless, R. Joshua does not believe her. This Mishnah shows us the strength of R. Joshua’s position; he does not believe her claim even in the presence of a “migo.”<br>Rabban Gamaliel believes her in the second Mishnah, where she claims “I was a mukat etz” even though in this case she has no “migo.” She has made the best claim she could possibly make.
Introduction<br>Today’s section opens with another Mishnah, with two sections. In both sections, Rabban Gamaliel and R. Eliezer dispute whether the woman is believed. I should emphasize that these mishnayot have nothing to do with virginity claims.
In the Talmud below there is debate over what the woman was seen doing.  According to some, she was seen having intercourse with an unknown man, and that “talking” is a euphemism for sex.  Others say that she was merely talking with him, but there was suspicion that they had had sex.  It is important to remember that the situation is that she is a single woman and there is no issue of adultery.  However, if she had had relations with a man who was forbidden from marrying an Israelite, such as a mamzer or a natin, she would subsequently be prohibited from marrying a priest.  When asked who this man was she provides his name and says that he is a priest.  Note that it is not essential that he is a priest; it is sufficient that he is a man who is not prohibited from marrying an Israelite.<br>Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer again rule that the woman is believed and may subsequently marry a priest.  Since she has a presumption of being fit to marry a priest, it requires solid evidence to remove her from this presumption.<br>Rabbi Joshua holds that since she was secluded with him, she loses her presumption of being fit to marry a priest.  She must bring proof that this person was not prohibited from marrying an Israelite and until then she may not marry a priest.
This section of the mishnah is nearly identical to the section above, the only difference being that this woman is pregnant.  The reason why the mishnah reiterates the positions outlined in the previous mishnah is to teach that Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer believe the woman even if she is pregnant.  In the previous dispute, it was unclear whether or not she had even had sex with the man in question.  When asked who he was, she could have said that she never had relations with him.  Therefore, when she admitted that she did but said that she was a priest (i.e. one who is allowed to marry an Israelite), she is believed.  However, in this section it is certain that she had relations with someone and she could not make a better claim than to say that the man was fit to marry an Israelite. Nevertheless, Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer hold that she is believed.<br>A further innovation is that not only is the woman believed, and she is subsequently allowed to marry a priest, but her child is assumed to be fit to marry an Israelite.  In other words, even though we don’t know for sure that the child is not a mamzer or a natin, the law treats him/her as if he was not.<br>Rabbi Joshua again states that the woman is not believed. Furthermore, her child is assumed to be the child of a natin or a mamzer and may not marry an Israelite until s/he proves otherwise.
Ze’iri understands the “talking” in the Mishnah to refer to her being secluded with an unknown man. But according to R. Assi she was seen actually having intercourse. So then why does the Mishnah say that she was seen talking? The answer is that “talking” can be a euphemism for sex. The Talmud cites another euphemism, this time from the book of Proverbs. This verse refers to an adulterous woman.
The Talmud now asks why we need two mishnayot that are so similar to each other. For Ze’iri this is not a problem, because he interprets the first Mishnah to refer to a case where she was only secluded. R. Joshua says she is disqualified from marrying a priest even in this case. And Rabban Gamaliel would declare her fit even if she is known to have had sex with another man. So both mishnayot are necessary.<br>Assi cannot use this reason, because he interprets “talking” to refer to sex. Therefore in both mishnayot it is clear that she had sex with an unknown man. So R. Assi offers another reason for the necessity of two mishnayot. The first declares her to be fit to marry a priest (according to Rabban Gamaliel), and the second, in which she is pregnant, teaches that her child is also fit to marry a priest.
Below we will see a dispute whether the one who declares the woman herself to be fit, also declares her offspring to be fit. R. Assi, who says that one Mishnah teaches, that she is fit and the other teaches that her offspring is fit, would have to agree with the one who holds that if she is fit, her daughter is fit as well.
Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section Ze’iri interpreted “talking” in the Mishnah to mean “being secluded.” The woman in the Mishnah is being accused of being secluded with a strange man. R. Assi interpreted it to mean that she was seen actually having sex. Today’s section continues that discussion.
Ze’iri’s interpretation of the Mishnah implies that R. Joshua would not allow a woman who had been secluded with an unknown man to subsequent marry a Kohen. This clashes with a statement made by the amora, Rav. Rav said that if a wife is secluded with a man who is not her husband she does receive the punishment of lashes (I know this bothers people, but it probably is just the way the rabbis say that she has transgressed. It does not mean they actually did this). Nevertheless, she is not prohibited from staying with her husband. This means that Rav does not think she actually had sex with the other man. So does Rav contradict R. Joshua, who does not believe her?<br>The resolution is that there is a difference between marrying into the priesthood, the topic of the Mishnah, and remaining married to one’s husband, the topic of Rav’s statement. When it comes to marrying into the priesthood, the rabbis were strict. Even seclusion with a strange man would disqualify her.  But when it comes to remaining with her husband, there needs to be more evidence that she was an adulteress for her to be prohibited.
This baraita is basically the same as the Mishnah except here instead of her being seen “talking” with someone, she is seen entering into a hidden place or into a ruin. The Talmud will now explain that this baraita is a difficulty on R. Assi who interpreted “talking” in the Mishnah to mean that she was seen having intercourse.

Daf 13b

Introduction<br>Today’s section brings a baraita to refute R. Assi who had interpreted “talking” in the Mishnah as the woman being seen having sexual intercourse.
This is a long baraita which relates to the situation in the Mishnah—a woman is pregnant, but we do not know who the father was. The first opinion, which follows Rabban Gamaliel, says that a woman is believed when she says that the father was a fit person, meaning he had proper lineage. R. Joshua says she is not believed. He argues from the case of a woman who was captured, a topic we will return to later. The assumption is that she was raped by her captors and therefore she is forbidden from subsequently marrying a priest. R. Joshua says that the case of the woman who is pregnant is the same—she is not believed. The rabbis say that the case of the captive woman is different, for there we have witnesses that she was taken captive. R. Joshua responds that her pregnancy is clear testimony that she had sex.<br>The other rabbis now try to draw another distinction between the two cases. The captive woman was taken captive by non-Jews, who we assume are unrestrained in sexual matters. But the woman who is pregnant was not necessarily among a group of non-Jews, and therefore it is more likely that she had relations with someone permitted to her.<br>Finally, the baraita adds an important caveat. She is only believed with regard to herself. But with regard to her offspring, she is not believed. Therefore the offspring must be considered a “shetuki” a child whose father is not known.
The Talmud now explains some of the dialogue in the baraita. The main thing is that the Talmud adds a shift in topic into the middle of the baraita. At first the rabbis admit to R. Joshua that he successfully responded with regard to the pregnant woman. Such a woman is indeed like a captive woman in that we can be sure she had intercourse. But what about a woman seen “talking” meaning secluded.<br>Joshua responds that there is no “guardian in sexual matters,” which means that after they have been secluded, we can assume they had sex.
Assi had interpreted “talking” as her being seen having intercourse. In his opinion, if she is only seen secluded with an unknown man, R. Joshua would not prohibit her from marrying a priest. But this baraita clearly teaches two different cases, one where she is seen talking and one where she is pregnant. Therefore, R. Assi’s opinion is refuted. 
Introduction<br>This section continues the discussion from in yesterday’s baraita, comparing a woman taken captive with the woman found pregnant by an unknown man.
The rabbis did not respond to R. Joshua that when she was taken captive most of the captors would have been men who would disqualify her if they had sex with her (non-Jews).  But when it comes to the pregnant woman, most men would not disqualify her.<br>The fact that the baraita does not mention this difference (at least not explicitly) supports R. Joshua ben Levi who says that it really does not matter whether the majority of men were fit or unfit. R. Joshua says that she is not believed and Rabban Gamaliel says that she is.
 Introduction<br>The Mishnah contained a dispute between Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer whether a woman who was pregnant from a man whose identity is unknown is still fit to marry a priest. Rabban Gamaliel says she is believed to say that the man was a priest (and therefore she is fit) and Rabbi Joshua says she is not believed. Our sugya deals with the status of the offspring.
Yohanan says that the opinions in the Mishnah concerning the woman herself also apply to her offspring. Rabban Gamaliel would say that just as she is fit, so is her offspring. And of course, Rabbi Joshua disqualifies her offspring, just as he disqualifies her (from marrying a priest).<br>Elazar though makes a distinction, one explained by Rabbah. The mother was born fit to marry a priest. This gives her a presumption, a hazakah, of fitness. In order to remove someone from their hazakah, we need solid proof, which in this case is lacking. However, the child has no such hazakah; from its birth it was not known what its status was. Therefore, even Rabban Gamaliel would admit that the child may not marry a priest (if it is a girl).
Elazar uses the end of the baraita found in yesterday’s section as a difficulty on R. Yohanan. The baraita seemed to explicitly state that only the woman herself was fit. The offspring is definitely unfit, a shetuki, which means one whose father is unknown.<br>Yohanan resolves this by saying that while the child is a “shetuki,” she is still fit to marry a priest. This is an innovative reading of the word, which the Talmud will now need to explain.
The Talmud reinterprets the meaning of “shetuki.” A child whose father is not known is not considered a priest, even if we can be sure that his father was a priest. To be a priest one would need to know exactly who one’s father is. But if this child is a girl, she is still fit to marry into the priesthood. In other words, the mother is believed to say that the father was fit. The child too is fit. But there is no way we can consider the child a priest.
Introduction<br>As often happens the abstract discussion of the halakhah is followed by some actual case law. In today’s case a betrothed woman comes in front of a rabbi with her fiancée.
The woman who comes in front of R. Joseph with her fiancée is not yet married. Nevertheless, she’s pregnant (it happens now and it happened then). The issue is can we be certain that the child is his. R. Joseph says that since the fiancée says it is his, and since the halakhah follows Rabban Gamaliel who said she is believed, we can certainly believe this particular pregnant woman.

Daf 14a

Abaye critiques R. Joseph based on a statement by Shmuel who said that while the halakhah is according Rabban Gamaliel, we should not declare her (or her offspring) fit unless most men were fit for her. This means that most men, who if they had sex with her, would not disqualify her. A betrothed woman is forbidden from having sex with anyone, and the only one who would not disqualify her is her fiancée. So, Abaye says, in this case, we should not believe her. 
The Talmud resolves Abaye’s difficulty by analyzing closely Shmuel’s statement. Shmuel said the halakhah follows Rabban Gamaliel—she should always be believed. But then Shmuel said that that this halakhah should not be acted on unless the majority are fit for her. The resolution is that ab initio, meaning at the outset, a rabbi should not rule like Rabban Gamaliel unless most men are fit for her. But if the deed already happened, meaning she is already pregnant, ex post facto we can act like Rabban Gamaliel and trust her.
Introduction<br>In the Mishnah R. Joshua said that a woman is not believed to say that the man she either had relations with or got her pregnant is fit. In today’s section, the Talmud raises a source that seems to contradict this.
In a Mishnah from Tractate Eduyot R. Joshua says that a widow who had been married to a priest whose lineage was not certain can still subsequently marry a priest. Rashi explains that this priest’s mother may have been a divorcee or may not. If his mother was a divorcee then he is a disqualified priest (a halal). The woman he married would then not be allowed to marry a priest. But since his status is only doubtful, she is allowed to be remarried to a priest.
Rava now explains the difference between the two situations. In the case of the widow of the man of uncertain lineage, we can assume she would have examined his lineage before marrying him. Lineage was very important in making a marriage decision and a woman would not marry without first ascertaining that the priest she thought she was marrying was really a priest. But in our Mishnah in Ketubot the woman was not marrying, she was having sex with a man not her husband. In such situations, we cannot expect that the woman would check her lineage before having licentious relations with someone. Therefore, R. Joshua would not believe her.
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues to discuss the seeming contradiction between the Mishnah in Ketubot and the Mishnah in Eduyot. Whereas yesterday we focused on Rabbi Joshua, today we focus on Rabban Gamaliel.<br>As a reminder, our Mishnah deals with a woman who says that the man with whom she was secluded or had sex was fit to marry her—Rabban Gamaliel believes her, R. Joshua does not.<br>In the Mishnah in Eduyot R. Joshua said that a widow of a priest whose mother is a doubtful divorcee can subsequently marry another priest.
Rava points out that there is not only a seeming contradiction between R. Joshua’s statements, Rabban Gamaliel also seems to contradict himself. In Ketubot, he believes the woman. In the other Mishnah he says that while in theory he accepts R. Joshua’s testimony, that such a widow may remarry a priest, he also adds in that the halakhah cannot be this way because the priests do not listen to the rabbis to “bring near,” meaning to allow one of doubtful lineage to marry into the priesthood. They only listen to the rabbis in order to distance, to forbid someone from marrying a priest.<br>Rava now offers a new resolution for both Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Joshua. Rabban Gamaliel believes the woman in the case in Ketubot for she is certain that the man she slept with was fit to marry her. But in Eduyot her husband’s lineage is unknown. Therefore, he says we act stringently.<br>Rabbi Joshua did not believe the woman in Ketubot for there is only one doubt—was the man she slept with fit to marry her or not? But in the case in Eduyot there are two doubts. It is not entirely clear what this “double doubt” exactly is. Rashi suggests that since the status of his mother was in doubt—was she a divorcee when she married the priest or not—the son’s status is considered a “double doubt.” Other commentators say the double doubt refers to a complicated situation where the mother may have been a divorcee and we’re not sure whether the child belonged to the first husband (in which case the child is a valid priest) or to the second husband. In any case, the principle is that when there is a double doubt, Rabbi Joshua rules leniently.
Introduction<br>Today’s section defines exactly what a “widow of one from mixed family” is. I should note that the Hebrew word for this is “the widow of dough.” “Dough” is something that is mixed up such that its original ingredients are no longer recognizable. This is a reference to the lineage of this priest—we don’t know what family he is from.&lt;
The entire baraita defines the “widow of one of a mixed family.” Rabbi Joshua had said that such a widow may marry a priest, and Rabban Gamaliel had basically agreed, but added that the priests don’t listen to the rabbis with regard to these types of matters.<br>According to Rabbi Meir, as long as we know that the husband was not a mamzer, natin or descendant of slaves, then his wife is a “widow of one of a mixed family” and she may marry a priest. By implication, if there is the possibility that the husband comes from mamzerim or natinim (similar to mamzerim in that they are both defective lineage) then the widow may not marry a priest.<br>R. Shimon b. Elazar explains what we are concerned about with the “widow of one of a mixed family.” We are concerned that her husband was a “halal,” the offspring of the union of a priest and a woman whom he is forbidden to marry. Such a “halal” would disqualify his widow from subsequently marrying a priest. People don’t always know who is a “halal” and who is not, so we have to be concerned that such a woman was married to a “halal.” Indeed, part of why people do not recognize the “halal” is that it is not forbidden for her to marry a halal. But people don’t have to be concerned that she was married to a “mamzer” or someone with a similar lineage, because people know who the mamzerim are. This is probably because an Israelite woman is not allowed to marry a mamzer.<br>The following sections will explore what exactly the differences are between the opinions of these various tannaim.
The Talmud clarifies here that to Rabban Gamaliel all that matters is whether her claim is certain. If it is, she is believed even if there is one doubt. And if it is not certain, she is not believed, even if there are two doubts.<br>Rabbi Joshua holds the exact opposite. If there are two doubts, she is believed, even if she is uncertain. And if there is only one doubt, she is not believed, even if she is certain.<br>We might summarize by saying that Rabban Gamaliel examines her claim—how certain can she be of what she is saying—whereas Rabbi Joshua examines the situation—how likely is something to be true.
Introduction<br>Today’s section defines exactly what a “widow of one from mixed family” is. I should note that the Hebrew word for this is “the widow of dough.” “Dough” is something that is mixed up such that its original ingredients are no longer recognizable. This is a reference to the lineage of this priest—we don’t know what family he is from.
The entire baraita defines the “widow of one of a mixed family.” Rabbi Joshua had said that such a widow may marry a priest, and Rabban Gamaliel had basically agreed, but added that the priests don’t listen to the rabbis with regard to these types of matters.<br>According to Rabbi Meir, as long as we know that the husband was not a mamzer, natin or descendant of slaves, then his wife is a “widow of one of a mixed family” and she may marry a priest.

Introduction<br>Today’s section defines exactly what a “widow of one from mixed family” is. I should note that the Hebrew word for this is “the widow of dough.” “Dough” is something that is mixed up such that its original ingredients are no longer recognizable.

Such a “halal” would disqualify his widow from subsequently marrying a priest.

But people don’t have to be concerned that she was married to a “mamzer” or someone with a similar lineage, because people know who the mamzerim are. This is probably because an Israelite woman is not allowed to marry a mamzer.<br>The following sections will explore what exactly the differences are between the opinions of these various tannaim.
Introduction<br>Today’s section analyzes the baraita that was in yesterday’s section. It does so by asking a series of questions about the baraita.
The Talmud begins by asking why it seems that if her husband may have come from a mamzer, she would not be fit to marry a priest, whereas if we’re concerned that her husband was a halal (a disqualified priest), then she can still marry a priest. After all, both are biblical prohibitions. I should note that they are prohibitions in the sense that if they have relations with a woman, they disqualify her from subsequently marrying a priest.
The second question asks what the differences are between R. Meir’s opinion and the previous anonymous one? Indeed they seem to be exactly the same.
Here the Talmud detects a self-contradiction within the baraita. R. Shimon (two of them, actually) says that Israelites do not know who the halalim are. This would imply that if a priest may have been a halal, his widow should not be allowed to marry another priest. But the beginning of the baraita had said the exact opposite—that if there may have been a halal, she may not marry into the priesthood.
Yohanan says that the dispute between the first opinion in the baraita and R. Meir, as well as between R. Shimon and the first opinion is over a person who protests when called a mamzer but is silent when called a halal. The dispute is over how to interpret these responses.<br>According to the first opinion, silence implies agreement with the insult. So if someone is called a halal and does not respond, we can assume that he indeed is a halal.
Meir says that if someone is silent when called a mamzer or a natin, we can assume that he acquiesces to their silence. No one would be silent in the face of an accusation that would disqualify him from marrying any Israelite. But if someone is called a halal and is silent, he may just not have bothered responding. After all, being a halal is not so bad. He can still marry any Israelite woman. The only consequence would be that his kids would not be able to be priests.
Shimon b. Elazar then responds to the earlier report of what R. Meir had said. According to this report, R. Meir made fit a person who when called a halal was silent. According to R. Shimon b. Elazar, this is not what R. Meir said. R. Meir actually said the opposite—a person is fit when silent after being called a mamzer, figuring that people will know he is a mamzer. That’s why he does not bother responding.<br>But if he is called a mamzer and protests, then that is a sign that he actually is a mamzer. And if he is called a halal and he is silent, then we have to be concerned that he actually is a halal. He is silent because he thinks that if he protests they will exclude him from the congregation, assuming that he is a mamzer.<br>Thus the real debate is over whether someone who does not protest when called a halal is considered a halal.<br>I should note that R. Yohanan’s resolution is much more than an actual resolution of the baraita. The Talmud conjures up some difficulties that really not are such difficulties in order to facilitate taking a new point into consideration—what does this person say when confronted with the possibility that his lineage is problematic. The baraita itself addressed only the issue of the status of a widow who had been married to a man of doubtful lineage. R. Yohanan brings in an important additional element to the discussion.
Introduction<br>Today’s section contains two baraitot dealing with the lineage of a person who when called a halal or a mamzer is silent.
According to the first baraita, which correlates with the R. Shimon b. Elazar’s report of R. Meir’s opinion in yesterday’s section, if someone is called a mamzer and is silent, he is valid. He is silent because he figures the truth will come out. But if he is silent when called a halal, he is unfit. He is only silent because he figures if he opens his mouth, he could make matters worse.<br>But the other baraita holds the opposite, in accordance with the words stated directly by R. Meir in the earlier sections. If he is silent on being called a halal, he is still fit. He is silent because the consequences are not so bad, so he figures why bother responding. But if he is called a mamzer and is silent, he is acquiescing and we can assume that he really is a mamzer.
Introduction<br>Today’s section is the last Mishnah of the chapter. It relates to the topic discussed in the previous two mishnayot—if a woman had sexual relations with a man and it is unclear whether that man was permitted to her, can she subsequently marry a priest.<br>As I have stated many times, the Mishnah has a very limited focus. It discusses this subject and not any other aspect of the crime of rape. I realize that this is a sensitive topic in the modern world, but we should keep in mind the scope of the text we are reading.
The question in this mishnah is can this girl marry into the priesthood.  If the man who raped her was forbidden to marry an Israelite, then she is forbidden to marry a priest. This is true even though she did not willingly engage in intercourse with the man.  Although this sounds like the woman is being punished for having been raped, we would do well to keep in mind that priests were extremely cautious about the “purity” of their lineage.  The laws of who can and cannot marry a priest have nothing to do with morality, at least not as we understand it.  Rather they have to do with the prohibition of defiling the priestly line.<br>Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri rules that if most of the inhabitants of the town are men who are allowed to marry into the priesthood, meaning that their wives and daughters are allowed to marry priests, then this girl is allowed to marry a priest.
Introduction<br>Today’s section relates to the Mishnah from above. It deals with defining the majority necessary such that the girl who was raped by an unknown man remains fit to marry into the priesthood. I should note that the rabbinic determination of when we follow the majority is quite complex and does not really follow what moderns would define as normal statistical probabilities.<br>There are two main issues that the rabbis believe relevant: 1) Were there two groups of people from whom the rapist may have come, such that there would be “two majorities”? 2) Was the group stationary or moving? I think in our minds the issue would be simpler—what was the statistical likelihood that the rapist was fit? But the rabbis look at the issue slightly differently.
 Rava wants to analyze this last Mishnah in light of the dispute between R. Joshua and Rabban Gamaliel, neither of whom discussed the issue of the status of the majority of people. R. Joshua declared her unfit, even if the majority of men in the area were fit. And Rabban Gamaliel declared her fit, even if the majority of men in the area were fit.<br>I should note that we could easily solve this difficulty by noting the difference between the situation argued about by Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Joshua and in this Mishnah. They argued about whether the woman should be believed—i.e. she knew the identity of the man she had sex with. R. Yohanan ben Nuri addressed a case of rape—the woman did not know who raped her. In such a situation, she cannot be asked, so we need to use a different criteria to determine whether she is fit.
A series of amoraim say that the incident referred to in the Mishnah occurred at the time when the wagons would arrive at the marketplaces of Tzippori. As we shall see, this has to do with the issue of the definition of the majority. In this case there are two majorities here—the people of Tzippori and the visiting people.

Daf 15a

The Talmud now relates to the opposite case, where we know that the person came from Tzippori and not from a passing group. In such a case the offspring must be considered a “shetuki” a child whose father is unknown and who will not be allowed to marry any Israelite. This follows R. Hanina who said that we follow the majority of the city and not a majority of the people passing through.
The Talmud believes that we should not follow a stationary majority but we could follow the majority if it is moving. Therefore, the previous statement didn’t really make sense. We should not follow the majority of the city and we should follow the majority of a passing company.<br>The Talmud fixes this problem by emending R. Hanina’s statement. We follow the majority of the town only when the majority of the passing company is also fit to marry into the priesthood. But we do not follow a single majority in any case—either the inhabitants of the town or the members of a passing company.<br>Theoretically, we could follow the simple majority of the passing company because when the group is moving, one majority should be necessary. But we do not follow this majority lest we come to follow the majority of the inhabitants of the town. This would be problematic because they are stationary and a stationary majority is not followed.
Finally, the Talmud adds in that if the rapist had left the city, we would follow the majority of the city. This follows a general rule that anyone who separates from a group is considered to have come from the majority.<br>The only time we therefore need two majorities is where she went to the city. R. Zera said that if the group is stationary, we do not follow a single majority. Rather, we look at it as if half the city was fit and half unfit, in which case we would have to rule strictly. But if there was also another majority of men who were fit, she would be considered fit.<br>Let me try to summarize some of these rules:<br>If the group of potential rapists is moving—we follow a majority.<br>If the group is stationary, but the potential rapist left the group, we follow the majority.<br>If the group is stationary, and she went to the group, we do not follow the majority.<br>If there are two potential groups both of whom have a majority of fit men, then she is allowed to marry into the priesthood.
Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section we said that in order for the girl who was raped by an unknown man to be fit to marry a priest, there must be two majorities of fit men—the men of the town and the men of a passing company. Today’s section questions whether we really need two majorities.
The Mishnah compares the case of the rape in Tzippori with a case where it is not certain whether a piece of meat was kosher. If 90 per cent of the stores in town sell kosher meat (ritually slaughtered) and one store sells non-kosher meat, and a person does not remember which store he bought from, we do not follow the majority and the meat is prohibited. This is the case of a stationary majority where the person went to the majority. All of the meat was stationary and therefore we look at it as if there was no majority. But if a piece of meat was found elsewhere and we do not know what store it came from, then we do follow the majority, even though there is only one majority.
We cannot solve the difficulty by saying there were also groups of people passing through the city such that we would have two majorities. R. Zera said that we follow a majority even when the gates of the city are closed such that there could only be one majority.
The resolution distinguishes between the case of the girl in Tzippori and the case of the meat. The rabbis were extra stringent in matters of lineage, requiring two majorities. But with the case of the meat, one majority was sufficient.
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues discussing determining the status of something based on the probability of it being similar to the majority of the group.
Zera said that whenever we have something that is stationary, we must look at it as if it was evenly balanced between the two different groups. For instance, if I have a bag of marbles, 90 red and 10 black and I pick out one marble, according to R. Zera’s logic, we must consider it equally likely that the marble is black or red. This is true in all situations, whether this results in a leniency or a stringency.
The Talmud now searches for a tannaitic source for R. Zera’s rule. The first source is the rule concerning meat that we saw in yesterday’s section. This source does indeed teach that if the meat is stationary, meaning it has not left the store, we must look at it as if the likelihood of it being kosher is 50/50. But this is not a source for both sides of R. Zera’s statement—this is a stringency. We must continue to search for a case where it leads to a leniency.
Frogs are clean and the sheretz is unclean. If he touches one of these (when they’re dead) and does not know which one, he is unclean. This again is a source for the idea that stationary groups are treated as half and half. But again, it is a stringency.
This source gives the opposite situation—nine impure sheratzim and one pure frog. If this occurs in the private domain, he is unclean. But if in the public domain he is clean. When it comes to doubtful impurity, in the private domain the doubt is treated as unclean and in the public domain it is treated as clean. So here we have our leniency.
Introduction<br>Zera said that if the population was static, we treat it as if it were 50/50. In yesterday’s section we found a source in rabbinic halakhah for this idea. Today’s section searches (hard) for a source in the Torah for this idea. It begins on what seems to be a tangent, but will get to the topic eventually.
The discussion begins with a reference to a debate in Sanhedrin concerning a man who intends to kill one man and accidentally kills another. Rabbi Shimon says that he is not guilty of murder. He derives this from the words “for him” and “against him” (Deuteronomy 19:11). A person is not guilty unless he murders the person he intended to murder.
The other rabbis say that one who intended to kill one person and killed another is guilty of murder. The verse exempts a person who throws a rock into a group of people, some of whom are Jews and some of whom are not. In such a case the person is not guilty of murder because it is uncertain if he intended to kill a Jew.
The Talmud now considers what exactly the case was, in order to prove R. Zera’s principle that any time there is a stationary group it is considered to be 50/50.<br>Possibility one—the majority was non-Jews. In such a case the stone-thrower is not considered a murdered because most were non-Jews and one is not liable for murdering a non-Jew (I know, this is troublesome). This would not be because of the verse.<br>Possibility two—the group was half Jews, half non-Jews. In this case we could not convict the murderer because in capital cases, we rule leniently. When everything is even, we’d have to say that his intention may have been to kill a non-Jew.<br>Possibility three—the majority were Jews, but there was one non-Jew. In this case, we should convict him as a murdered because in all likelihood, he intended to murder a Jew. But because of the principle that any stationary group is considered to be 50/50, he cannot be considered a murderer. This is the source for R. Zera’s law.
According to R. Hiyya b. Ashi, R. Yose’s decision to rely on a single majority to determine the lineage of the child is halakhah for all generations. In contrast, R. Hanan b. Rava says that it was a temporary ruling. In general, two majorities are required.
Yirmiyah raises a difficulty on R. Hiyya b. Ashi who seems to have said that according to Rav we do not require two majorities for matters of lineage. Rav said in another tradition that if a child is found and the majority of the town was Jewish the court is commanded to sustain the child. But if there is only one majority the child is not considered to have proper lineage and cannot marry an Israelite.<br>Shmuel said that we save such a child’s life, but again he too would agree that the child is not considered to have proper Jewish lineage.

Daf 15b

The resolution is that R. Yirmiyah forgot that Rav had already said that the incident occurred in Tzippori, at a time when a caravan was passing such that there were two majorities. Thus Rav did not say that one could validate the child’s lineage without two majorities. 
Hanan b. Rava said that the decision in the Mishnah was a temporary decision. But if there were two majorities, then why was it only temporary.<br>The answer is that the one who taught one tradition, that there were two majorities, did not teach that it was only a temporary decision. This means that the conclusion of both parties is the same—if there were two majorities, then the child’s lineage is validated. If there was only one majority, then the Mishnah’s ruling was only temporary.
Introduction<br>The Talmud now goes back to analyzing the case discussed above about determining the lineage of a foundling child.<br>As I have stated a few times, the Talmud here posits that one does not need to break Shabbat to save the life of a non-Jew. This is a problematic, discriminatory halakhah that reflects the ethos of the time, but does not, and should not in my opinion, reflect the ethos of our time. In my commentary, I simply explain these halakhot, but I think it is important to state this at the outset. Another discriminatory halakhah appears at the end of the section.
This statement was found above in yesterday’s section. Here we will analyze Shmuel’s statement in particular. Shmuel said that the relevance is with regard to removing stones from on top of the child on Shabbat. Lifting up these stones on Shabbat would be prohibited, unless we were at least fifty per cent sure that the child was a Jew. The Talmud will now critique the fact that Shmuel said this.
Shmuel said that when it comes to saving a life we do not follow the majority. What this means is that if there is any chance that this child is Jewish we do save its life. This contrasts with his statement above, where he seemed to say that we rescue this child only if there is at least a fifty per cent chance that the child is Jewish.
The Talmud now changes the applicability of the statement and changes the wording as well. If the majority of the people of the town are non-Jews, then the child is considered a non-Jew. On this, Shmuel adds that when it comes to saving the child’s life on Shabbat, we do not follow this probability. We save the child even though in all likelihood the child is a non-Jew.
The Talmud now analyzes the practical ramifications of the various sections of the statement from above.<br>If the majority of the town is non-Jews, we can consider the child a non-Jew such that we can feed them non-kosher meat.<br>If the majority of the town is Jewish, then we are obligated to return to him a lost object. Note that by implication, if the majority of the town is not Jewish, then we do not have to return to him a lost object.
The ramifications of half of the residents being Jewish, and half non-Jewish, are with regard to damages. Before we analyze this, I should note a few relevant halakhot with regard to damages.<br>If a Jew damages the property of a non-Jew, the Jew is not liable [I know, this is discriminatory]. If a non-Jew damages the property of a Jew, he is always liable for full damages, even if had a Jew done the damage, the Jew would have been liable for only half-damages.<br>To return to our particular case: If an ox that belonged to a Jew gored an ox belonging to this foundling from a city that is half Jewish, the Jew could say to him, “Prove that you’re a Jew and then I’ll pay you.” Since the owner of the damaged party cannot prove that he is a Jew, the damager need not pay. So in this case, we cannot say he is being considered a Jew.<br>So it must be the opposite case—an ox owned by this child gored an ox owned by a Jew. The person from the town half of whose inhabitants are Jewish and half not, must pay the Jew half the damages, as if he was a Jew. But he can say that he won’t pay the other half until the Jew proves that he is non-Jewish. Since the Jew cannot prove this, we must assume that the child (now grown-up) is Jewish and he needs to pay only half of the damages. 
Congratulations—You finished the first chapter of Ketubot. You should know, that despite the fact that some of these topics seem obscure, this is one of the most well-learned chapters in the entire Talmud. Indeed, the chapter itself is sometimes called “Shas Katan”—the little Talmud—because it contains so many principles that are necessary and useful in understanding the rest of the Talmud.
Introduction<br>The chapter opens with a Mishnah which discusses a dispute between a husband and wife over whether the woman was a virgin or a widow when he married her.  Evidently, the written ketubah from their marriage is not available as evidence (perhaps it was never written).  Therefore this is again a question of whether or not the woman is believed.<br>We can further learn from this mishnah that the woman may collect her ketubah payment even if she does not have the document.  This is because the ketubah payment is a court-imposed obligation upon every husband.  The loss of the ketubah document does not mean that the woman will not be able to collect her ketubah payment.
In this mishnah the husband and wife come before the court at the time of their divorce.  The woman claims that she was a virgin when her husband married her, while he claims that she was a widow.  The mishnah rules that we check the evidence, and if there is evidence that her wedding was a virgin’s wedding, then she receives her full ketubah. In the absence of hard evidence, she can only receive a ketubah of 100 zuz.<br>There are three pieces of evidence described in our mishnah.  The first is the “hinuma”.  It is uncertain what this word exactly means, and several explanations have been offered.  Albeck explains the word as being a “hymn” sung at virgin’s weddings.  Based on the Talmud’s explanation, Kehati explains a “hinuma” to be a special veil worn only by virgins.<br>The second piece of evidence is that her hair hung down to her shoulders.  This is the manner in which women wore their hair during the procession that led them away from their father’s house.<br>The third sign, mentioned by Rabbi Yohanan ben Beroka is parched corn, which were distributed at virgin’s weddings.<br>We should explain why in this mishnah the woman is not believed and therefore needs to bring evidence that she was a virgin, whereas in the mishnayoth at the end of the last chapter, Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer believed the woman without any corroborating evidence.  The answer is that in this case both the man and woman can claim to be certain of the facts.  He is just as certain that he married a widow as she is certain that she was a virgin.  Therefore neither is believed more than the other.  Since the woman wishes to extract money from the man, the burden of proof is upon her, as is the rule in all monetary claims.
At the end of the last chapter there was a series of debates in which Rabbi Joshua consistently did not believe the woman and Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer did.  Our mishnah contains a case where Rabbi Joshua does believe the claim made (this time by a man).  The reason why he believes the man in this case is that he invokes a principle called, “the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permitted”.  This halakhic principle means that if a person says something which makes something forbidden to him he is also believed when he says something to make that very same thing permitted to him.  This Mishnah, and the few that will follow it (later in the Talmud) will illustrate this principle and limit its applicability.<br>Section one: In this case Reuven approaches Shimon and tells him that the field that is currently in Reuven’s possession was purchased from Shimon’s father.  Shimon did not approach Reuven first claiming the field, nor is there any other evidence that the field once belonged to Shimon’s father.  Indeed, without Reuven having told Shimon that the field once belonged to Shimon’s father, we would have thought that the field was always Reuven’s.  In this case Reuven is the “mouth that forbade” when he said that the field once belonged to Shimon’s father.  He made a statement that was detrimental to himself.  Since he is the “mouth that forbade”, he is believed to be the “mouth that permits” and state that he purchased the field from Shimon’s father.  Reuven is believed even if he produces no evidence that he bought the field.  Had Reuven kept his mouth shut, Shimon would never have known that the field once belonged to his father.  Therefore, Reuven is believed when he says that it used to belong to Shimon’s father but he bought it from him.<br>Section two:  In contrast, if witnesses come and state that the field was once Shimon’s father’s field, then Reuven is not “the mouth that forbade”.  He is only the “mouth that permits”, and he is therefore not believed.  After all, had he kept his mouth shut, the field would have been taken over by Shimon.  In order to retain possession of the field he will need to bring proof that he bought it.

Daf 16a

Introduction<br>Today’s section begins to discuss the Mishnah.
The Mishnah says that if there are witnesses that she was married with the customs of a virgin, then she is believed and she receives a ketubah of 200. The implication is that in the absence of witnesses, the husband is believed and her ketubah would be that of a widow. This would mean that this anonymous mishnah accords with Rabbi Joshua and not Rabban Gamaliel.
This mishnah could accord even with Rabban Gamaliel (who always believed the woman in last week’s cases), for in this case both she and her husband are certain in their claims. He is certain that she did not wear the veil worn by virgins and she is certain that she did. Therefore, in this case, the woman does not win. In contrast, in the other mishnayot, she was certain, either that she was a mukat etz, or that she was raped after betrothal. In contrast, the husband is not certain that she lost her virginity through premarital intercourse. He can only be certain that he believes that she is not a virgin. That is why she is believed.
The Talmud now asks why we ever questioned the relationship between this mishnah and that in the previous chapters. Obviously the case in this chapter is where both parties are certain. The answer is that we might have thought that since most women are virgins at their wedding (meaning most marriages are first marriages) she is certain and he is not certain. Therefore, this mishnah teaches that she is not believed, even according to Rabban Gamaliel.
The Talmud now proves that Rabban Gamaliel agrees that in the case in this chapter’s Mishnah the woman is not believed. The Mishnah says “and Rabbi Joshua agrees” implying that just as Rabbi Joshua agrees in the second clause of this Mishnah (concerning the person who says, “This field was your fathers, but I bought it from him,” Rabban Gamaliel agrees with Rabbi Joshua in the first clause.<br>However, this too is rejected. Rabbi Joshua may be agreeing with a principle that Rabban Gamaliel said in the previous chapter. This principle is called “miggo.” I have explained it above, but I will do so again here. It means that if someone makes a claim that is not the best claim they could have made, they are believed. The Talmud will delve into this in depth below. So stay tuned!
Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section we learned that Rabbi Joshua’s statement in the second half of the first Mishnah of this chapter refers to a disagreement he had over a “miggo” in the first chapter. Again, a miggo is a case where a person made a certain legal claim but could have made a better claim. Generally in such cases, the person is believed. The logic is that if they wanted to lie, they would have made up a better lie. Therefore, they are assumed to be telling the truth. The Talmud now tries to find out what this refers to. Where is there a “miggo” that Rabbi Joshua disagrees with?
In the case in this Mishnah, the woman made the best possible claim she could have made—the child is the offspring of a priest. Therefore, there is no “miggo.” So this cannot be the “miggo” with which Rabbi Joshua disagrees.
According to Zeiri’s interpretation of this Mishnah, there would be a “miggo.” The woman is accused of being “secluded” with a man and she responds by admitting that she did have intercourse with him, but that he was a “kosher” guy—meaning sex with him would not disqualify her from subsequently marrying a priest. Had she wanted to make up a better claim, she could have said that she didn’t have sex at all. Therefore, when she admits she had sex, she is believed.<br>But R. Assi interprets the phrase in the Mishnah, “she was talking” to mean that she is accused of having sex. So she could not have made any better claim. Therefore there is no “miggo.”
In this Mishnah the wife says that she was a “mukat etz,” meaning she lost her virginity through some way other than sex, and her husband says that she lost her virginity through sex.<br>According to R. Eliezer she is claiming a ketubah of 100 and her husband wants to give her nothing. She could have made a better claim—she could have said that she was a virgin at betrothal and then became “injured by a stick” after betrothal. If this were true, she would get a ketubah of 200. Therefore, she has a miggo and is believed when she says that she was injured by a stick before betrothal.<br>But according to R. Yohanan, she is claiming a ketubah of 200, the highest level of ketubah she could possibly get. So what possible miggo could there be? 
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues the search for the “miggo” which R. Joshua disagrees with. To put this another way, in what case mentioned in the mishnayot of the first chapter does the woman make a claim that was not the strongest claim she could have made.
Finally the Talmud locates a case where the woman could indeed have made a better claim. The woman in this Mishnah responds to her husband’s claim that she was not a virgin by claiming that she was raped after betrothal. She will indeed receive the whole ketubah (if believed) but by claiming that she was raped after betrothal, she disqualifies herself from subsequently marrying a priest. [A woman who had sex with a man prohibited to her is forbidden from marrying a priest, even if that sex was not of her own choice.] She could have made a better claim here—she could have said that she was injured by a piece of wood after betrothal. With such a claim she would receive the full ketubah, and be allowed to marry a priest. Since she makes a worse claim, Rabban Gamaliel believes the worse claim that she actually makes.
Joshua now says to Rabban Gamaliel that he believes the man who says, “This field belonged to your father but I bought it from him,” because he has a miggo (to be explained below). But in the case in the previous chapter, despite the existence of a miggo, R. Joshua does not believe the woman. 
The Talmud now asks the obvious question—since R. Joshua accepts the principle of miggo, why does he believe the man who says, “This field was your fathers, but I bought it from you” but not the woman who says, “I was raped after betrothal”?<br>The answer is that there is some evidence that she was not a virgin in the case regarding the woman. This is the “slaughtered ox”—i.e. evidence. But in the case in this chapter’s Mishnah, there is no evidence whatsoever as to whom the field belonged. The only evidence is the man’s words. He could have said, “This field was always mine” and we would never have known any different. Therefore, R. Joshua believes him when he says he bought it from the other person’s father.
The Mishnah had stated that only if witnesses come to testify that she was married as a virgin does she receive a full ketubah. However, we also said earlier that the fact that most women are virgins at marriage might have turned the husband’s claim into “uncertain.” The Talmud picks up on that point and says that if most women are married as virgins, shouldn’t we just assume that she was a virgin as well. Why not believe her?<br>The answer is that had she been a virgin, people would have known about it. A first time wedding is a big deal—it has a “voice”—people will talk about it. Since there does not seem to be clear communal knowledge that this woman was a virgin at her marriage, she loses the assumption that she is part of the majority.

Daf 16b

The Talmud now goes in the other direction. If people generally know when a woman is getting married for the first time, and no one is saying that this woman was married for the first time, then we should assume that she was not being married for the first time. The witnesses who come and say that this was her first marriage must be lying.<br>Ravina therefore emends his statement from above. It is not always known that a woman being married is being married for the first time. It is just a case of “most.” Most of the time people will know that a woman is being married for the first time. But some of the time they will not. And since witnesses come and testify that this was her first marriage, we can assume that she was not part of the majority. She must have been the rare case of a woman who was married as a virgin but people did not know about it.
Introduction<br>The Mishnah had stated that if there were witnesses that she had worn the virgin’s veil at her wedding or witnesses to any other sign of this having been her first marriage, she receives a ketubah of 200 zuz. In other words, she basically collects her ketubah payment without producing the written document. The Talmud asks how we can be sure that she cannot collect her ketubah twice, once on the basis of witnesses and then a second time using the document itself.
The Talmud offers two solutions to the problem I mentioned above. First of all, they could write a receipt for the husband when he pays out his ketubah. This way he will not have to pay twice. Second, the Mishnah could refer to a place where they do not write out ketubot, probably due to a lack of scribes. In such a place, there is no fear that she will be able to collect with a written document, for there is no such document.
The Talmud now teaches the same traditions of R. Abbahu and Rav Papa but in reference to a different baraita. First the baraita mentions the possibility that there was a ketubah, but for some reason it has been misplaced. Next the baraita provides additional signs that the wedding was that of a virgin. If there are witnesses either to the ketubah or to the performance of one of these actions, then she is considered to have been wedded as a virgin.
The problem now is how can Rav Papa say that this baraita refers to a place where they do not write the ketubah! First of all, the baraita says that “she lost her ketubah.” This, the Talmud explains, might mean that although they don’t normally write ketubot in this place, in this particular case the husband happened to have written her a ketubah.<br>The problem then goes back to the same issue we had in the first place—if he wrote her a ketubah, what’s stopping her from collecting twice, once with witnesses and once with the document?
As an answer, the Talmud interprets “she lost it” to mean “she lost it in the fire.”<br>But this too is problematic. First of all, now the baraita is repetitive. Second, we would still have the problem if she hid it—she could take it out and collect twice. Third, if the baraita meant to teach that she lost it in the fire, why say that she lost it [this difficulty seems to really just be a repetition of the first one].
To answer all of these difficulties the Talmud rephrases the baraita. If she lost her ketubah she must prove that it was burned. Until she does so, she does not collect any ketubah, for fear that she will collect twice.
The sugya concludes, as these types of sugyot often do, by noting that the one who taught the amoraic statements of R. Abbahu and Rav Papa in reference to the baraita, would also teach these statements in reference to the Mishnah, where it is easier to apply them (mostly Rav Papa’s statement). But those who teach them in reference to the Mishnah would not teach them in reference to the baraita due to the difficulty of Rav Papa saying that the baraita refers to a place where they do not write ketubot, when the baraita explicitly mentions the writing of a ketubah.
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues to interpret the mishnah from the beginning of the chapter.
Just as in yesterday’s section we had a fear that she would collect based on witnesses and then try to collect again based on the same evidence using other witnesses. So how do we prevent this?<br>The answer is that if there is no other way of preventing this, then they have to write out a receipt.
The Talmud now explains the symbolic meaning of the cup of wine passed before her at the wedding. The first explanation is that it is a cup of terumah wine. Terumah can only be consumed by a priest. So by passing terumah wine in front of her, we are symbolically saying that she was fit to be married by a priest.<br>The problem is that while a divorcee will not be able to eat terumah if she is marrying a priest, a widow could. So how can this cup be a sign of her being a virgin, when a widow can have terumah?<br>Rav Papa therefore applies a different symbolic meaning to the cup. Terumah is called “first” and it is this woman’s first marriage. So the terumah is symbolic of her.
In a baraita, R. Judah mentions a slightly different practice performed at the weddings of virgins—they would pass a barrel of wine in front of them. Rav Adda son of Ahava clarifies this practice. They would pass a closed barrel in front of virgins and an open one in front of women who had already had intercourse.<br>This practice is obviously insulting to the non-virgin. Why not just pass the barrel in front of the virgin and do nothing in front of the non-virgin.<br>The answer is that sometimes positive testimony that she was married not as a virgin is required. If she seizes 200 zuz, the ketubah amount for a virgin, then if the practice was not to pass a barrel at all in front of a non-virgin, she could claim that they just did not have access to a barrel of wine. Therefore, they instituted the practice to pass an open barrel in front of a non-virgin so that everyone would know she is not a virgin. [I think it is significant that the Talmud notes that it is insulting to pass an open barrel in front of the non-virgin].
This is a famous debate between Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel—should one be honest with a bride about her appearance or should every bride be praised? Bet Hillel holds that despite the untruth, one should always strive to make others feel good, praising them and the things that they have bought. There is no reason whatsoever to tell a bride that she is not beautiful.

Daf 17a

Introduction<br>This section continues to cite traditions about songs and dances at weddings.
What is most fascinating to me about this source is the equation it draws between a bride on her wedding day and the rabbi receiving ordination. Both are described as graceful or beautiful gazelles, despite the fact that they do not wear any makeup or beautify themselves. The image of the physical and feminine beauty of the Torah scholar is common in rabbinic literature and probably represents a rejection of the normal masculine image.
The meaning of some of the words I have translated is not particularly clear, but the general sense of the tradition is. When these two rabbis were ordained, this is the song that they sang to them.
The Talmud is basically collecting stories of sayings stated in front of Rabbis concerning their beauty or related attributes. This one is simply when R. Abbahu would come to the Emperor’s court.
These are more traditions concerning dancing in front of a bride before her wedding. To this day, in traditional circles it is customary for the rabbi to dance in front of the bride.
This last story explores what might be the problem with some of this behavior—does it border on sexual impropriety. Rav Aha would actually put the bride on his shoulders and dance around with her. He warns his students that if they want to do this too, they must make sure that she is “like a beam,” meaning there are no sexual aspects to the act, then it is okay. But if they cannot help having sexual thoughts with the beautiful bride on their back, then they should refrain.
Again, this source alludes to the overt sexuality at a wedding. Men at the wedding may look at a bride, for by their being sexually attracted to her, her husband’s desire for her will grow. However, the halakhah does not follow this tradition. According to this opinion, while there may be some positive benefits to engendering desire for the bride, the act is simply too fraught with danger.
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues to discuss various aspects of the bridal procession.
These kind of halakhot are how the rabbis express their value system. The value of a wedding is greater than the value of a funeral procession. While I doubt that such a conflict would in reality occur all that frequently, the rabbis say that the needs of the wedding take precedence.<br>Finally, royalty and the honor and fear due to royalty take precedence over both. However, the story of Aggripa, who was king over Israel during the Second Temple period, seems to contradict this point—Aggripa forgoes his honor and allows the bridal procession to pass by in front of him. For his willingness to forgo his honor, the sages praise him.
The Talmud now detects a problem with Aggripa’s behavior—kings are not supposed to forgo their own honor. We might think of this as respecting the office even if the person holding that office does not feel the need to be respected. So Aggripa should not have allowed the bridal procession to go in front of him.<br>The resolution is that they were at a crossroads, such that it would not have looked to everyone as if he was letting the procession go in front of him. But had they not been at the crossroads, it would have been forbidden for Aggripa to allow the bridal procession to pass him.
In this baraita we again see a hierarchy of values, but a complicated one. In the rabbinic mindset, few things rank higher than the study of Torah. But there are a few exceptions. To a certain extent, the needs of a bride and the burial of the dead take precedent over Torah study. But this is only true in a collective sense—the Torah studying community must ensure that the needs of the dead are taken care of. But, if there are already enough people at the funeral procession, the Torah scholar should continue to study Torah.
Above, we said that if there are enough people for the funeral procession, then one does not interrupt Torah study. But what is enough? The simple sense sounds to me like a normal amount of people for a funeral, whatever that might have been. But the answers given are extremely large. It sounds to me like what these rabbis are basically saying is that there is no such thing as “enough” people at a funeral procession.<br>At the conclusion of this passage, the soul is compared with the giving of the Torah—just as the Torah was given in front of 600,000 people, so too the soul, the inner Torah, should be taken away in the presence of 600,000 people. This is a beautiful image—our neshamot, our inner spirits and life force, are our own personal Torah.

Daf 17b

Introduction<br>Today’s short section defines the unusual word “hinuma” which I translated as a veil. This “hinuma” was the sign of her being a virgin.
There are two definitions of the hinuma. The first is that it refers to the way the huppah itself was made. The second is that it refers to the veil. Since she sometimes falls asleep behind the veil. It is called “the veil under which the bride naps.”
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues to explain the Mishnah.
In the Mishnah R. Yohanan ben Beroka said that the passing out of parched grain is the sign of the wedding of a virgin. But that is the sign of proof only in Judea. This is not a universal custom (what is?).<br>In Babylonia, evidently they would pour oil on heads of the rabbis at the wedding of a virgin.
The dialogue here illustrates that not everyone knew of this custom. Evidently, R. Papa was puzzled by it. Abaye rebukes him, even making a not particularly nice reference to his mother!<br>The Talmud then illustrates this with an actual story of this as it occurred at the wedding of a rabbi’s son.
One might have thought that there might be a positive sign at the wedding of a widow, something to let everyone know that a widow was being married. But according to R. Joseph there is not. The sign that a widow is being married is simply the absence of the sign of a virgin being married—the distribution of roasted ears of grain.
Introduction<br>Today’s section begins to deal with the case in which R. Joshua agrees—if a person says to his fellow, this field belonged to your father and I bought it from him, he is believed.
Joshua in the Mishnah illustrates the “migo” [a claim made when a better claim could have been made] with the case of a person who says “I bought this field from your father.” But why use this example when he could have stated a simpler case, “I bought this field from you.”<br>The answer has to do with the second clause. If the first clause is a case of “I bought this field from you” and he is believed, then the second clause would have had to have been “I bought this field from you” and there are witnesses that it belonged to the other person. In such a case, since there are witnesses, the claimant has no “migo”—he could not have made a better claim. Therefore, he is not believed. Below we shall see the problem with this, had this been the case illustrated in the Mishnah.
To understand this section I must explain the concept of hazakah. Hazakah means presumption or assumption. If a person uses a field, meaning eats its produce or shows that he owns it in some other way, for three years, he is assumed to own the field, even if the other person holds the deed. The idea is if the person holding the deed wanted to protest that another was using his field, he should have done so during those three years. The fact that he did not, means that he must have sold it to the person using it.<br>So the problem in our Mishnah is why should his claim matter—all that should matter is whether he demonstrated ownership by eating the produce of the field.
The problem is that even if the case involves the father—“I bought it from your father”—whether he is believed or not should hinge on whether he used it for three years and established “hazakah,” a presumption of ownership. Why does the Mishnah say that the claimant’s believability depends on the presence of witnesses who say that it once belonged to the other person’s father?<br>The case in the Mishnah could work vis a vis the father, if the claimant used the field for two years while the father was alive and then one year after his death. These three years of use do not establish “hazakah” a presumption of ownership, because, as Rav Huna teaches, there needs to be three years of acting as owner in front of one person. Think of it this way—if the person used the field for two years while the father was still alive, the father may have intended to protest during the third year, as is his right. When the father died, the son should have three full years to protest as well. Thus hazakah is not a factor in this case.<br>If this is the case, then the Mishnah works. If the only way we know that the field belonged to the other party’s father is through the claimant’s words, then he (the claimant) is believed. This is a case of “the mouth that prohibits is the same mouth that permits.” But if there is external evidence that the field belonged to the father, then the claimant must produce evidence to be believed.
The Talmud now raises the problem that R. Huna seems to be teaching us what is already in the Mishnah. Why should he teach us something that we could have already derived from there? There are two answers to this [somewhat insignificant] difficulty. 1) He makes explicit what was only implicit in the Mishnah. 2) He adds the case where the son had already become of age. We might have thought that in this case, it would be sufficient for the person to use the field for two years in front of the father and one year in front of the son. Therefore, R. Huna teaches that it is not.
Introduction<br>This section continues yesterday’s discussion. There we learned that in order to establish hazakah, presumption of ownership, the possessor must use the land for three years in front of one person. If the person used the field for two years while the father was alive and one year while his son was alive, this is not sufficient.
The Talmud still tries to find a case that does not involve the father and yet there is no hazakah. Such a case could be one where the possessor used the field for two years in front of the previous owner and then the owner ran away. Since he was not present to protest for three consecutive years, there is no hazakah. However, now the Talmud will examine what the specific case was.
If the person fled due to danger to his life, he [the claimant] is obviously not believed. The original owner could not have protested because he was running away to save his life.
The Talmud now proves that if the original owner fled for financial reasons, he should have protested, even if he was not in close proximity. This is learned from a Mishnah. The Mishnah divides Palestine into three regions for matters of hazakah. For the possessor to establish hazakah, the original owner must be in the same region. The Talmud will now use this to prove that one can protest even if he is not in the presence of the possessor.
The Talmud refers to a discussion that occurred elsewhere concerning this Mishnah—can the original owner protest in the absence of the possessor? If he can, then why should he not be able to do so when they are in different regions? And then when he doesn’t protest, the hazakah should be valid. In other words, the fact that he can protest makes hazakah possible. And if he cannot protest when not in front of the possessor, then why should he be able to do so when they are in the same region, but not together?
Abba bar Mamel says that according to the Mishnah one may protest in the absence of the possessor. The Mishnah says there is no hazakah when they are in different regions because they are so far apart that the possessor might not hear the original owner’s protest. If he doesn’t hear it, then he may not bother holding on to the document that he used to purchase the land from him. Since the protest cannot work, there can be no establishment of hazakah through possession. In other words, establishing hazakah works only when the original owner could protest and does not. If he could not protest effectively, then there is no such thing as hazakah.<br>It always dangerous to travel from Judea to the Galilee. Therefore, these two lands were mentioned, but the same would be true for any two lands between which it is dangerous to travel.

Daf 18a

Introduction<br>This section returns to asking the same question that was asked early on the previous page. Why does R. Joshua illustrate his law by citing the case of one who says, “This field belonged to your father and I bought it from him.” Why not use a different case?
This case would seem to be a proper illustration of a migo—the person could have kept his mouth shut and no one would have known that he had borrowed a maneh from his friend. He is the mouth that prohibited (i.e. admitted that he owed money) and he is the mouth that permitted (said that he paid him back). So why not use this case?
The problem with the above way of teaching the Mishnah would be that the last clause would have to read that if there are witnesses that he borrowed a maneh, then he is not believed to say he paid it back. This is not true—a person is believed to say he paid back a debt, at least from Torah law.
Introduction<br>Today’s section contains another suggestion as to what the Mishnah could have taught instead of the case of “This field was your father’s and I bought it from him.”
In this case, the person admitting that he had borrowed money claims to have paid back half. This would seem to be another cogent case of a migo—had he wanted he could have said he paid the whole thing back and no one would have known the difference.
The problem with using the example of returning half of a debt is that it brings us into the case of the one who admits to owing a partial debt. In this case, R. Eliezer b. Yaakov says that he must take an oath that he doesn’t owe the rest of the money. Our Mishnah in Ketubot does not mention an oath, and therefore this case could not have been used according to this view. The other rabbis hold that a person who admits to owing half a debt is like one who returns a lost object. He is believed not because of any migo (he could have made a greater claim) but because we do not force people who are returning lost objects to take oaths that they are returning the entire amount. Even if the claimant asked for his father’s debt to be returned, the person would be believed to say that he already returned half because he is like someone returning a lost object.
Introduction<br>At the end of yesterday’s section there was an implication that according to R. Eliezer b. Yaakov, when one returns a lost object, he may have to take an oath that he has returned the entire amount. The specific case had been a person who says, “I owed your father a maneh and now I am returning half.” The Talmud now questions whether R. Eliezer b. Yaakov indeed holds such a position.
Rav answers the difficulty by saying that the person must take an oath that he already paid back half of the debt when a minor (we’ll call him Shimon) claimed that the person (Reuven) owed his father the debt. This is not really a case of “returning a lost object” because there was a claim of debt before Reuven announced that he had paid back half to Shimon’s father. In other cases, if someone is simply returning a lost object without someone making a claim against him, he would not have to take an oath that he was returning the whole amount.
The problem with the above interpretation is that in general one does not have to take an oath in response to a claim put against him by a deaf-mute, person lacking sound senses or a minor, because we cannot have a high level of certainty concerning the veracity of these persons’ claims. So when the son claims that another person owed his deceased father money, the person being claimed against should not have to take an oath.<br>For this reason, the Talmud reinterprets “minor” to mean “son of….” He is not really a minor, he is just regarded as a minor vis a vis the affairs of his father.
We’re still not out of the woods yet. The baraita in yesterday’s section said that “sometimes a person must take an oath on his own statement.” The way we are now explaining this baraita is not that the Reuven initiated the statement by saying, “I owed your father money but I paid half.” Rather, Shimon, the son of the deceased father, initiated the claim.<br>This problem is not solved, forcing the Talmud to now offer another explanation for this baraita.
The concept explained here is called “the one who admits to owing part of a debt.” The idea is that if Shimon claims that Reuven owes him money, and Reuven admits to owing part of the debt, the Torah imposes an oath on him to verify his admission. The psychology of this halakhah is interesting. Reuven would not be so brazen as to deny an entire debt. Telling such a big lie directly to a person from whom one has borrowed money is just too much. But if Reuven does not have the money to pay back the full debt, he may allow himself a smaller lie—I only owe you half the money. To prevent people from denying half the debt, the Torah imposes an oath on Reuven in such a case.

Daf 18b

The Talmud now plugs the debate about the applicability of Rabbah’s statement back into the baraita on yesterday’s page. According to R. Eliezer b. Yaakov, a person would not be so brazen as to fully deny a debt no matter who is claiming the debt—the father or his son when the father is deceased. Even if the son is a minor, the debtor would not be so brazen. Therefore, this case of “I owed a maneh to your father and I paid him back half” is like any other admission to a partial debt—the debtor must take an oath. We cannot trust him because psychologically, this is the biggest lie he is capable of.<br>But according to the other rabbis, psychologically people might tell a bald lie to the son of the original debt holder, and deny the whole debt. It is easier to lie to a person when the debt was not directly to him. Since he does not deny the whole debt, we believe him when he says that he has paid back half of the debt. To put this another way, the person was capable of denying any debt whatsoever. When he admits that he owes some of the money, he need not take an oath because he is acting graciously. We should trust him.
Introduction<br>We now move on to the next Mishnah. It contains another case illustrating the principle of “the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permits,” the operative principle from the first Mishnah of the chapter.
<b>Section one:</b> In this scenario, a person comes to court with a document signed by witnesses.  When his opponent claims that the document is a forgery, the witnesses are summoned to the court to testify to their signatures.  The witnesses state that the signatures are indeed their signatures, but that nevertheless the document should not be upheld.  This is for one of three reasons:  they were forced to sign, they were minors when they signed, or they were disqualified witnesses (see Mishnah Sanhedrin 3:4).  In this case they are believed, and the document is invalid. This is because of the principle of “the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permits”.  Without the witnesses’ admission that they signed the document, the document would have been invalid.  When they admit that they signed, they are in fact “the mouth that forbade.”  When they say they were forced, or that they were minors or otherwise disqualified, they are the mouth that permits, and they are believed.  To state this another way, if they had wanted to lie they could have said that this was not their handwriting.<br><b>Section two:</b>  If their signature can be validated in another way, for instance by other witnesses testifying that they recognize the signatures, or by another document that contains their signatures, then the witnesses are not believed when they say that they were forced, or they were minors or otherwise disqualified.  This is not a situation where “the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permitted”.  Since they are not believed to say that they were invalid, their signatures are validated and the document is upheld.
Introduction<br>Today’s section discusses the clause in the Mishnah where witnesses say that they did sign the document, but that they did so under duress.
At this stage of the sugya, Rami b. Hama is understood as relating to the second clause in the Mishnah—the witnesses are not believed to say they signed under duress because there were other witnesses attesting to their signatures. Rami b. Hama says that this is true only if they were essentially bribed to sign on the document. If they claim they were forced by threat to life to sign on the document, then they are believed. The logic seems to be that the witnesses did not have any choice but to sign the document.
Rava says that a witness cannot simply recant his testimony, even if he claims that he signed under threat to his life. If witnesses could do so, their testimony would essentially be meaningless. This is true whether their testimony was oral or by signing a document—once a person has testified, he cannot recant.
Due to Rava’s difficulty, the Talmud shifts the section of the Mishnah on which Rami b. Hama was commenting (this is a common move). He was referring to the first clause, where the witnesses are believed to recant their testimony. They are believed only if they claim that they signed under physical duress. If they claim that they signed under the influence of a monetary threat (or bribe) they are not believed, because saying that one accepted a bribe is making oneself out to be wicked. This is a form of self-incrimination, which is generally unacceptable in Jewish law. Therefore, the person is not believed to recant his testimony. His signature on the document will stand.
Introduction<br>In this last section of this daf, R. Meir argues against the Mishnah, according to which witnesses are allowed to recant their testimony.
According to the Mishnah, witnesses who signed on a document are believed to say that they signed under duress, were minors or were otherwise disqualified to testify. This would invalidate the document. Here in a baraita we see that this opinion was that of the majority of rabbis, who hold that as long as we have a case of “the mouth that prohibited [signed] is the same mouth that permits [retracts testimony]” then they are believed.<br>Rabbi Meir, however, disagrees. In essence he is saying we don’t believe the witnesses when they try to retract their testimony. The Talmud asks what his reasoning is.
Rabbi Meir does not believe witnesses who claim that they were “disqualified from testifying” because we can assume that the creditor assure that the witnesses were valid witnesses before having them sign the document.
If the witnesses claim they were minors, and therefore invalid to testify, R. Meir discounts their retraction because there is an overriding presumption that all of the parties to the document, the lender, the borrower and the witnesses, were of majority age.

Daf 19a

Hisda explains that if the witnesses claim that they were forced to sign the document they are not believed because had they actually been faced with the choice of signing a false document or being killed, they should have chosen the latter. Therefore, even if they say that they were forced by threat to life, they are incriminating themselves and they are not believed.
Rava raises a significant problem with R. Hisda’s explanation. We have a tradition that the saving of a life takes precedence over everything except for three prohibitions—idolatry, illicit sexual acts and murder. So he was justified in signing the document under duress, and should be believed later to recant.
Rav here provides an entirely different reasoning for R. Meir. Once a debtor admits that he wrote up a debt document (or agreed to have one written on his behalf) the creditor need not ascertain the validity of the witnesses. Therefore, this document was already valid. We did not need witnesses to validate it. If so, then we do not have a case of “the mouth that prohibits is the mouth that permits” because it was the debtor that really “prohibited” by admitting that he had the document written up.
Introduction<br>This week’s daf continues to discuss the tradition that was found at the end of last week’s daf.
Rav had said that if a borrower admits that he had a debt document written up and signed by witnesses, the lender does not need to confirm it by bringing the witnesses to the court. In this case, the borrower will not be believed to say that he repaid the debt, so long as the document is in the hands of the creditor. Above, this opinion was identified with R. Meir who had said that if the witnesses say they signed the document, they are not believed to say that they did so under duress. R. Nahman therefore criticizes him—why make a statement as if it is anonymous, when really what you’re saying is that the halakhah follows R. Meir?
Nahman actually disagrees with Rav. When creditors come to his court with signed documents, but without being able to confirm the witnesses, he tells them to go and get the witnesses confirmed. Only then will he allow them to collect the debts.
Introduction<br>This sugya discusses a “loan document of trust.” This is a document which states that Reuven loaned money to Shimon. However, the loan did not really occur. The document was drawn up so that Reuven could give the money to Shimon any time he wants, without having to find a scribe to write up the document.
One of the parties to this document holds the document and says that although it says that Reuven loaned to Shimon, Reuven has not yet given the money and therefore Shimon owes him nothing. Rav says the one who makes this statement is believed. The question is—who said that it was only a loan of trust. If it was the debtor, then why should we believe him? By saying that it is only a loan of trust, he is in denying his debt. If the creditor said it, why shouldn’t we believe him. Even if he did really loan the money, he always has a right to forgive the loan.
So now the Talmud examines the possibility that the witnesses made the statement. But this too is problematic. If we can verify the witnesses’ signatures through another document, then obviously they are not believed. We would have a case here that is not “the mouth that forbids is the same mouth that permits” for we do not need the witnesses’ testimony at all. And if their signature cannot be verified from elsewhere, then why should they not be believed. This is indeed a case of “the mouth that prohibits is the mouth that permits,” for without their affirmation, the document would not be valid at all.
Before the explanations begin, the Talmud records a mnemonic to help remember the order of the rabbis.<br>According to Rava (B), it was the debtor who said that it was a deed of trust and he is indeed not believed. Once he has admitted that he had the document written up, he cannot go back and claim that it was only a deed of trust.
Abaye (A) says that the creditor says it, and yet he is not believed, despite the fact that in most such cases he is only doing injury to himself. This specific case refers to an instance where the creditor also owes money to another party. By denying that this document is a real deed of debt, he is ultimately denying income to the person to whom he owes money. Therefore, he is not believed.
1. Ashi (SH) says that the witnesses say that it was only a deed of trust, and that this is a case where there was no other confirmation of their signatures. The question asked above is why this is not a case of “the mouth that prohibits is the mouth that permits” and we should believe these witnesses. The answer is that the law prohibits holding on to a deed of trust. Such a deed could lead to unrighteousness, for a person could claim that he is owed money even if he never lent it out. Therefore, we must assume that this is not just a loan of trust and that the creditor actually loaned out the money.

Daf 19b

This is further support for why we don’t believe witnesses who say that the deed was only a loan of trust. Since, as we saw above, loans of trust are forbidden and lead to unrighteousness, we make the assumption that the loan document was real, meaning the loan actually occurred.
Introduction<br>This section continues to deal with unrighteousness and debt documents.
The verse used here is the same used at the end of yesterday’s section. A creditor should not hold on to a paid debt document, because such a document might be used to collect a second time. Even if he does not intend to use the document in such a way, a person should do all he can to distance himself from such a possibility.
The “West” here refers to the land of Israel for it is west of Babylonia. Rav interprets the entire verse from Job as referring to the retention of various types of deeds. The only example we have not yet seen is the “deed of sale for accommodation.” Elsewhere, Rashi explains that this is a deed through which a person fictitiously gets rid of their property so as to prevent another person from having a claim on them. For instance, a woman might want to give her property to someone else when she gets married so that her husband would have no rights to them. The idea is that she is not really giving him the property—she’s just trying to avoid the property from coming under her husband’s control.
There were two different opinions as to the application of the verse “And let not unrighteousness dwell in your tents.” In today’s section it refers to a paid bill of debt, but in yesterday’s section it referred to a loan deed of trust (the loan never happened). As the Talmud often does, it compares these two applications of the verse. The one who says that holding on to a paid bill of debt is morally wrong would also oppose holding on to a loan deed of trust. However, the opposite is not true. The one who opposes holding on to a loan deed of trust may allow one, under certain circumstances, to hold on to a paid bill of debt, for at times the debt is held by the scribe in order for him to collect his fees.
Introduction<br>The previous section discussed certain documents that one should not keep in one’s house. Today’s section begins with a reference to scrolls (books) of Holy Scripture that one should not have in one’s possession.
The problem with keeping an uncorrected scroll (of the Bible) in one’s home is that it might be used and the error in the book would then be perpetuated. We must remember that in this period all books had to be copied by hand from another scroll. The fear that an uncorrected version would begin to spread is quite understandable.
We have already explained what a deed of trust was—a deed drawn up only in case someone needs to borrow money later on. If the witnesses testify that while they did sign the document, the loan was not executed, they are not believed. By signing the document they are testifying that the loan did happen, and once they testify, they cannot retract. Furthermore, as we have learned, it is forbidden to write up such a document in the first place.<br>The same is true if they testify that along with a sale or loan there was a declaration of duress. For instance, Reuven sold his property to Shimon, but along with the sale he told the witnesses that he was doing so only under duress. Again, witnesses are not believed to say this, because a person should not sign such a document in the first place.
Mar bar Rav Ashi disagrees with Rava concerning the latter case. It is forbidden to write up a deed of trust, as we learned in the past two sections. But it is permitted to write up a document that is accompanied by a declaration in order to protect the seller who was being forced by the buyer to sell. Indeed, one could argue that under certain circumstances one would have to write such a document. Since the document can be written, the witnesses are believed to say that the deed was written up under duress.
Introduction<br>This section continues yesterday’s discussion concerning witnesses who attest to their signatures on a document but at the same time somehow undermine the document’s validity.
Rava asks if witnesses are believed if they add that the sale was made on condition and that as far as they know, the condition has not been fulfilled. Are they believed? On the one hand, just as was true in the case of witnesses who testify that the deed was of trust or was accompanied by a declaration, their words would invalidate the document and therefore they should not be believed. On the other hand, maybe they are believed because they are testifying that the document was valid. Their testimony that there was a condition placed on the sale is separate testimony, and perhaps there is no reason to reject it.
Nahman answered him that indeed the witnesses are believed. When such a document would come in front of him in court, he would tell the parties to go fulfill the conditions attested to by the witnesses, and then they should come back to the court.
Nahman above determined that witnesses can testify to there being a condition on the document. Here the situation becomes more complex—both witnesses testify to the general validity of the document, but one says that it was accompanied by a condition, and one denies the existence of a condition.<br>Papa says that since we have two witnesses on the document, the document itself is valid. But the condition does not have two witnesses and therefore it not valid.
Huna son of R. Joshua brings up a problem. Even if they both say that there was a condition we should not believe them because once they have testified to the validity of the document, they cannot testify again as to its invalidity.<br>Rather, in general we consider witnesses who say that there was a condition on the document and that it has not been fulfilled as uprooting their testimony, not adding to it. Therefore, even if one uproots his testimony, the document is left without two valid witnesses and it is invalid.
Introduction<br>This section discusses a baraita similar to the Mishnah above that illustrated the principle of “the mouth that prohibited is the same mouth that permits.”
But if there are other witnesses that this is their handwriting or their handwriting comes out from another place, from a document which was challenged and then confirmed in a court of law, they are not believed.<br>This baraita echoes the Mishnah, except the original witnesses died. Their testimony can be confirmed either by other witnesses who recognize the signature of the original witnesses or by their signatures being compared to another document that had been confirmed in a court.<br>If witnesses testify that this is indeed the signature of the original witnesses, but that their testimony should be invalid for one of three reasons (the same as those found in the Mishnah), then they are believed. This is a case of “the mouth that prohibits (testifying to the validity of the document) is the same mouth that permits (testifying to the invalidity of the testimony).”<br>However, if the dead witnesses’ signatures can be confirmed from elsewhere we don’t have a case of “the mouth that permits is the mouth that prohibits.” Therefore, is considered valid, despite the second set of witnesses who have testified to its invalidity.
The Talmud questions why we should consider this a valid document. After all, we have two witnesses who say that the document is valid and two who say it is not. Why should one set be given priority over the other?<br>Sheshet answers that the original witnesses need to be contradicted in their presence. This is a rule adopted from the rules of rebuttal—cases where the second set of witnesses say that the first set of witnesses were not even there to witness the event, but were with them elsewhere. Just as “rebuttal” must be in front of the original witnesses, so too must “contradiction.”

Daf 20a

Introduction<br>At the end of last week’s section R. Sheshet stated that witnesses can be contradicted only in their presence. Here, R. Nahman challenges that assumption.
Let’s remind ourselves of the case under discussion. Two witnesses are signed on a document and then die. Their signature is attested to by two other witnesses or confirmed by another document. Then come along two witnesses who say that the original signature was signed under duress or was otherwise not valid. The baraita had ruled that these latter witnesses are not believed and that the document can be used. R. Sheshet had said that this was because the original two witnesses who signed the document were not here such that they could be contradicted. Therefore, their testimony stands. But R. Nahman notes that this is absurd—maybe if they had been here they would have agreed that their testimony was invalid. Why then should the original witnesses’ testimony still stand?
Nahman said that what happens here is that the sets of witnesses offset each other—one set says the document is valid and one set says it is not. In such a case we are left with no testimony. So what does the court do? The money remains in the hands of the one who possesses it, which is in this case the borrower, who need not pay back the debt. When the baraita said that the latter witnesses were not believed to validate the document, it meant that the document was not torn up. If it were to be confirmed later on, it could be used to collect the debt. Also, if the opposite party (the creditor) were to seize the debt, he would now be the possessor and it would be impossible to take it back from him without proof.
The above resolution is similar to the ruling of R. Ashi concerning a lunatic who sold property. If he sold it during a time of lucidity, the sale is valid. But if he sold it at a moment of madness, the sale is not valid. There are two sets of witnesses who dispute when he sold the property. R. Ashi says that each set cancels the other out and we are left with no testimony. Since the last known owner is the lunatic, the property remains in his hands.
The Talmud limits R. Ashi’s rule to a case where the field was part of the lunatic’s heritage. In this case, he is the presumptive owner because it was his family’s field. However, if he himself bought the field, then is not the presumptive owner because it is possible that he acquired it in a moment of lunacy. Therefore, we do not assume that the field is his. It would belong to the person who acquired it from him.
Introduction<br>To understand the first part of this section I should better explain what “rebuttal” (הזמה) of witnesses is and how it differs from contradiction.<br>“Rebuttal” is when a second set of witnesses come to the court and say that the first set could not possibly have known that which they testified about, because they were in another place on that day. In other words, they rebut the very possibility that the first set of witnesses could actually be witnesses. Contradiction is simpler—the second set provides different details as to the event (i.e. first group says Joe was the killer and the second group says it was Jon). Another difference is that if witnesses are “rebutted” they receive the punishment they tried to dish out on the accused. But if they are only contradicted, no such consequences are suffered.<br>The topic of rebuttal is discussed in the first chapter of Makkot.
According to R. Abbahu, the laws of rebuttal are more stringent than the laws of contradiction. This is probably due to the seriousness of the punishment of rebutted witnesses. Since they are punished for their false testimony, the accusations against them must be in their presence.
The Talmud now returns to discussing a baraita from Daf Yod Tet. That baraita had said that if there was a document confirming the witnesses’ signature, then the second set of witnesses are not believed to state that the first set signed under duress, were minors or disqualified in some other way. But for the document to be used to prove the signatures, it must have been contested and then upheld in the court. Otherwise, the second document’s validity is not assured either. A contested and upheld document is known to be valid, similar to the way we require notarization today.
The Nehardeans, a group of rabbis from the Babylonian city of Nehardea, say that in order to uphold the signatures on a document there need to be either two ketubot to confirm their signatures or sales documents of two fields. The sale of those two fields needs to itself have gone unprotested, meaning the purchasers used the fields for three years without a protest. If the sale of the field went unprotested, we can be sure that the signatures are valid.
Shimi bar Ashi says that these other two documents used to confirm the signatures in a third document must come from a second party, and not belong to the person who wants to uphold the signatures in the third document. If the party wishing to uphold the documents owns the other two documents, we fear he may have forged the signatures. This would not have been difficult because he owned them both. If the other two documents belong to someone else, then forgery will be more difficult because he would have to look at them, memorize the signatures and then go home and forge them. This is obviously too difficult, almost an impossible task, and therefore we are not concerned with such a possibility.
Introduction<br>Today’s section discusses writing a document to remember something that one has seen.
The baraita teaches that if a person witnesses something, he may write down a written record, an affidavit, of what he saw. Then he may use this document to recall the events he saw and testify about them, even after several years.
Huna seems to question the legality of remembering the testimony by aid of a document. Therefore, in order for the person to testify, he must remember at least some of the events himself.<br>Yohanan, on the other hand, has no such doubts. Even if he remembers nothing, as long as he wrote something down, he can rely on his written record. Rashi adds that after he looks at the document, he must recall the events himself. In other words, even according to R. Yohanan, he must remember a little. He uses the document to remind himself, but he testifies from what he remembers, not just what is written down.<br>Rabbah takes this a step further. If two people witness an event together and later one forgets what happened, one person can remind another person. This, to Rabbah, is similar to remembering through a written document.
Introduction<br>This section continues the discussion in yesterday’s section where we learned that if two people witness an event, and one forgets some details, one witness can remind the other of what occurred.
There is a debate here whether the litigant himself may remind the witness of what he saw. The ruling is that he may not. We fear that since the litigant has a stake in the issue, he may cause the witness to falsely remember the events. The other witness is not a party to the issue, and therefore we trust that he will not unfairly bias the second witness.

Daf 20b

If the witness is a Torah scholar, then he may be reminded of his testimony even by the litigant himself. This is illustrated by a story involving Rav Kahana and Rav Ashi. Rav Ashi is reminded of the events by Rav Kahana, but on being reminded, he remembers what happened himself. His testimony is accepted. This seems to be an explanation for the entire sugya—the witness is reminded of his testimony, but we (at times) trust that what he is remembering is his own testimony, and not the words of others being placed in his mouth. 
Introduction<br>Today’s section relates only tangentially to the previous sugya—both are concerned with memory. The immediate issue here is the purity or impurity of mounds. The fear is that a body (or part thereof) was buried underneath the mound.<br>The end of the sugya connects this issue to the larger issue of testimony that we have been discussing in Ketubot.
If the mound is near the town or road, we can assume it is unclean, for when want to bury a body, they don’t want to wander too far away from the town or off the road. If they are not so near, then it depends on whether they are new or old. It is more likely that one would remember if the mound was used for burial if it is newer.<br>Meir defines near and old in absolute terms—near is fifty cubits and old is sixty years. In contrast, R. Judah offers relative terms. Near means it is the closest mound to the road or town and old is so sold that no one remembers it.
The Talmud now brings up a problem with the baraita. There is a principle that we don’t assume that ground is impure. So how can we just make a blanket assumption that any mound outside of the city or road is impure?<br>Zera therefore limits the applicability of the rule in the baraita. Only the mounds near a town near a burial place are impure. And only the mounds near a road near a burial place are impure. In other cases, we don’t assume that any old mound was used as a burial place.
The problem with R. Zera’s solution is that if the town and road are near the burial place, then why would people bury in mounds—why not just bury in the cemetery?<br>With a road this makes some sense, because sometimes it might happen that it gets dark on the way to the cemetery and people fear going there at night. Therefore, they bury in a mound on the side of the road. But if we are talking about a town near a cemetery, why would people bury in mounds and not just go to the cemetery itself?<br>Hanina answers that there are some special categories of people who might bury in one of these mounds, namely people who are not burying bodies, but rather either abortions (or miscarriages) or limbs. The Talmud assumes that the women bury their own miscarriages alone and therefore might fear going too far. If the burial place is close, within fifty cubits, she will go there alone. But if it is further away, she would take a man with her and go to the cemetery. If she cannot find a man, we fear that she might bury the miscarriage in a mound on the side of the road.<br>[R. Hanina’s statement seems to actually explain why people would bury in mounds in the first place. It seems less of an answer as to why we assume that near ones are impure and distant ones are impure.]
But this general principle is rejected by the Talmud. R. Meir refers to a specific instance—the mounds found outside a city or off a road. It’s not his responsibility to remember what was placed in these mounds, therefore he will not remember it. But if a person is appointed to witness something, he may remember it even after sixty years. A person is more likely to remember something if he is told to remember it. He won’t remember as well things that he just happens to have seen.
Introduction<br>The section is a mishnah which continues the discussion concerning witnesses who testify about their signatures.
<b>Section one:</b>  Generally, two witnesses are required to create valid testimony in Jewish law.  In order to validate a signature, two witnesses are needed to validage each signature on the document.  If each witness affirms his own signature and the other person’s signature, then both signatures on the document have been affirmed by two people, and the document has been validated.<br><b>Section two:</b> However, if each person cannot affirm the other signature on the document, they must find another person to affirm the signature.  Note that one person can affirm both signatures, so long as he recognizes them both.  All of this is Rabbi Judah Hanasi’s opinion.  He holds that the witnesses are actually testifying about their signatures and therefore we need two witnesses on each signature.<br>The Sages hold that a person is believed when he affirms his signature.  Therefore, neither needs to bring someone else to join his affirmation.  The Sages reason that the witnesses are actually testifying as to the contents of the document.  Hence the two are in and of themselves sufficient.

Daf 21a

Introduction<br>This section begins to discuss the mishnah from the end of last week’s daf.
In the Mishnah, Rabbi Judah Hanasi said that each witness testifies to his own signature and then a third witness must testify as to the validity of both signatures. This implies that the witnesses are testifying as to the handwriting in the document. That’s why they need a third party—each signature requires two witnesses to uphold it.<br>But the sages say that when they affirm their signatures, they give evidence as to the contents of the document itself. Therefore they don’t need a third party to join with them, for there are two witnesses as to the validity of the document.
The Talmud says that the above interpretation is obvious—why bother stating it. To answer this, they explain that it is certain to Rebbe that they are testifying as to their signatures and not the contents of the document. This is true whether it results in a leniency or a stringency (in the Mishnah, Rebbe was strict). For if Rebbe was uncertain, we might have said that in some cases, he would hold that they were testifying to the contents. This would have ramifications in the case where one of the witnesses died. We might have thought that Rebbe would not allow the living witness to testify to the signature of the dead witness for then ¾ of the testimony would be based on one witness (his own half and half of the other witness’s testimony). Therefore, the Mishnah teaches us that Rebbe holds that they are testifying as to their own signature, whether this results in a leniency (as in this case) or a stringency (in the case of the Mishnah). Since they are not testifying as to the contents of the document, if one died, we would not consider this as if one witness accounted for ¾ of the testimony.
This is the case where Rebbe would be lenient and the other sages would be strict. Rebbe would say that since they are testifying to the validity of their own signatures, this is not a case of ¾ of the testimony being based on one witness. But the sages would say that since they are testifying as to the contents of the document, we would need two outsiders to uphold the dead witness’s signature. Rav holds like the sages.
Abaye provides a remedy for a case where we cannot find two witnesses to testify to the signature of the dead witness. The living witness would sign a piece of clay and that signature would be used to uphold his own signature. This would free him to testify about the other party’s signature, without encountering the problem that ¾ of the testimony is based on one person’s signature.
He should write his name on a piece of clay but not on a piece of scroll. It would be dangerous to write one’s name on a piece of a scroll for someone could write on the top of the scroll an IOU document. Such a document has some validity—it can be used to collect from unmortgaged property. Writing it on a small piece of clay would prevent such a forgery.
Introduction<br>Today’s section opens with Shmuel’s halakhic ruling in accordance with the sages of the Mishnah who said that a person is believed to testify about his own signature. Each witness could come to the court and simply say—that is my signature.
Shmuel rules that the halakhah is in accordance with the sages. But this is obvious—the halakhah is always according to the majority (at least almost always). So why does Shmuel need to state the obvious! The answer is that we might have thought that since the halakhah follows Rebbe when he disputes a singular sage, the halakhah follows Rebbe even when he disputes the majority. Therefore Shmuel had to teach us that the halakhah follows the sages.
The mnemonic at the beginning of this section is meant to help remember who spoke to Rav Judah. What is significant is the document that came out of Shmuel’s court. On it was stated that both witnesses whose signature was on a document testified as to the validity of their own signature and that of the other witness. This seems to follow Rebbe’s opinion in the Mishnah—the witnesses testify about the signatures and therefore two witnesses are required to testify on each signature. This contradicts Shmuel’s own ruling, where he says that the halakhah follows the sages, and that each person can testify alone as to his signature.
The answer is that Shmuel ruled strictly in this case for the deed was related to the property of orphans. Shmuel was worried that if he ruled leniently according to the sages, a subsequent court might rule like Rebbe and thereby disqualify the document. To offer extra security that the orphans’ documentation would not be damaged, Shmuel had two people testify to the validity of each signature.
Introduction<br>Today’s section starts to go deeper into some of the rules of testimony. This is a topic the Talmud will address now for a while.
If a document has been upheld by a court it will have on it the signatures of two witnesses and three judges. According to Shmuel, if later one someone comes to protest the validity of the document, one witness can testify together with one judge to validate the document.
While Rami b. Hama thought that the above statement by Rav Judah was excellent, Rava disagreed. The problem is that the judge testifies that the document was upheld in the court, and the witness testifies that he saw the transaction. How can different testimonies join together to become one?<br>Rami b. Ezekiel even says that we should not listen to the rules that Rav Judah, his brother said in the name of Shmuel. According to Rami, his brother does not accurately transmit Shmuel’s statements.

Daf 21b

This section echoes the one above. Amemar praises the tradition that Shmuel allowed a witness and judge to be joined into one testimony. But R. Ashi disagrees, this time accusing him of familial preference. Rami bar Hama was Amemar’s maternal grandfather, so R. Ashi thinks that Amemar praised the tradition because it was from his own grandfather. But Rava already refuted it above.
Three judges are sitting in court to uphold the validity of a document. Two judges recognize the witnesses’ signatures but one does not. Before the judges have signed their attestation to the document, they can act as witnesses, testify in front of the third judge, and then go back to acting as judges and sign the attestation to the document. But once they have signed the document, they are judges and cannot act as witnesses.
There is still a small problem—the attestation of the document says, “We were three sitting in judgment and we were informed…” But according to the above, this was written before all three could have been judges—only two knew of the signatures. Only the signing of the attestation occurred after the testimony. Therefore, what really needs to be done is for the attestation to be written after the two have testified before the third.
Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section we learned that if two judges recognize the signatures on a document, they may first testify in front of the third as to the validity of the signature and then the three may jointly attest to the document’s validity. Today’s section draws (or at least tries to draw) some lessons from that case.
The Talmud now learns from this three lessons. We will now examine the latter two of these lessons.
Ashi accepts that a witness can become a judge as a proper inference from the above case. But how do we know that in general if the judges recognize the signatures there is no need to testify in front of them. It is true that in this case only one of the judges heard the testimony (the judge who did not recognize the signature) and two judges did not (the two who recognized the signature). But this case may be different because there was some testimony in front of at least one of the judges. It may be true that if all three judges recognized the signatures, there would still be a formal need for someone to testify in front of them.
The third lesson was that there needs to be individual testimony in front of each judge who does not recognize the signature. But this case might be exceptional too, for the testimony of the two was the only testimony given. If two judges had not recognized the signatures, it might have been sufficient to have two witnesses testify in front of them together.
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues to deal with the halakhah that a witness can become a judge.
Safra used a mishnah from Rosh Hashanah concerning the sanctification of the new moon as a difficulty on the notion that a witness can become a judge. The mishnah teaches that if two of the judges see the new moon, they cannot simply testify to the third judge, and then be part of the court and sanctify the new month themselves. Rather, they find replacement judges, and then the two that saw the new moon testify in front of the other judges. If the witnesses could become judges, this would not be necessary.
A series of amoraim also find this question difficult and eventually the question is answered by Rav. The sanctification of the new moon was considered to be a biblical commandment, and therefore a witness cannot become a judge. But the upholding of a document, meaning the confirmation of its validity, is not a biblical commandment. Therefore the rules can be slightly relaxed.
Introduction<br>The Talmud continues to discuss the laws of upholding the validity of a document
Three judges sit in court in order to uphold a document, but a protest is raised against one of them (below the Talmud will explore what this protest was). The other judges can act as witnesses on his behalf, but only if they do so before they sign on the attestation. If they have already signed, in other words, if they have already acted as judges, they cannot go back and act as witnesses on the third judge’s behalf. Rashi explains that the reason is that they are self-interested parties. It does not look good for them to have signed with a disqualified judge.
What was stated about the judge that could disqualify him? The first possibility is the accusation that he is a robber. The problem with this is that he should not be validated by the second set of witnesses, because we have two versus two—two witnesses say he is a thief and two say he is not. This would not be sufficient to validate him as a judge. But if it is a matter of a family blemish (he is a slave-slaves were not allowed to testify) then they could just check into the matter and find out the truth. Why would we even need witnesses?<br>The resolution is that the first two testified that he is a robber, but the second two do not deny this. Rather they testify that he has repented. This shows the power of repentance. Denial that he was a thief does not validate him to serve as a judge, once proper testimony has been served against him. But he can be restored to being a judge if evidence of repentance is offered.

Daf 22a

Three judges are sitting to confirm the validity of a document, and before all three can sign, one dies. To avoid having to go through the process all over again, two can write in the document that they were in a session of three and one died. In essence they are testifying themselves as to the fact that they once were a court of three. But if they don’t write this in the document, then someone who sees two signatures on the attestation will think that the court had only two, and this is not sufficient to form a court.
Nahman b. Yitzchak says that they only need to write that they were a “court of law.” Since a court has to consist of three judges, we can assume this document’s validity. The Talmud adds that to ensure that this was not a court of only two judges, which would be valid in accordance with Shmuel’s rule that two judges can act as a court (although they should not do so, because this is considered acting arrogantly), they must write in it, “The court of our Master Ashi (the great rabbi Rav Ashi) and our Master Ashi told us.” Rav Ashi evidently ruled that a court of two was not sufficient.
Introduction<br>This mishnah in today’s section to discusses cases that illustrate the principle “the mouth that forbade was the mouth that permitted.”
<b>Explanation</b><br><b>Section one:</b>If the woman herself provides the information that she was married, but then says she is now single because she was divorced, she is believed, because the same mouth that permitted, forbade.  However, if other witnesses testify that she was married, she is not believed when she says she is divorced.  In order to remarry, she will need to bring proof, either with a document or witnesses.<br><b>Section two</b>:  If a woman is taken captive by a non-Jew, she is assumed to have been raped and is subsequently forbidden to marry a priest.  This is because she has had forbidden sexual relations, and priests cannot marry anyone who has had relations with some forbidden to them, even if the relations were against her will.  If the woman says that she was taken captive, and that information is not otherwise known, she is now “the mouth that forbade”.  Hence, when she says that she remained clean, i.e. she was not raped, she is believed and she can marry a priest.  However, if other witnesses testify that she was taken captive, she is no longer the “mouth that forbade”.  Therefore, she is not believed to permit herself to a priest.<br>If before the witnesses come and state that she was taken captive, she marries a priest, he is not obligated to divorce her.  This is because it is not certain that she was raped.  The Talmud says that even if she received permission to remarry before the witnesses came, she may marry a priest.  According to the Talmud, what is essential is that at the point when she was “the mouth that permitted” there was not an earlier “mouth that forbade”.  Therefore, as long as she makes her statement before the witnesses come, she will be allowed to marry a priest.
Introduction<br>Today’s section discusses the mishnaic principle, “The mouth that forbade is the same mouth that permits.”
Assi searches for biblical support text for the mishnaic principle of “the mouth that forbade is the same mouth that permits.” He locates this principle in the verse where a father says that he gave his daughter “to this man.” The phrase “to a man” is understood as if the father said, “I gave to a man but I’m not sure which one.” This would make her prohibited to all of the world because she could be married to any one of them. When he says “to this” he makes her permitted to this man.
The Talmud rejects the use of the verse for this purpose—the idea that a person who prohibited something can then make it permitted is simple logic. No special reading of a verse is necessary.<br>Rather, the verse from Deuteronomy teaches us the simpler principle—a father has a right to make a statement that would cause his daughter to be prohibited to the rest of the world by marrying her off to one man. [This right is limited; he may not do so after she reaches a certain age].
If the word “this” is not needed for the principle of “the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permits” then what do we need it for. R. Jonah uses it in reference to its original context, concerning the man who says that his wife was not a virgin. R. Jonah says that it refers to a case where the husband himself makes the claim, and not the brother-in-law. The brother-in-law would be in position to make this claim if his brother died after betrothing but before wedding his wife. The brother-in-law cannot make a virginity claim.
Introduction<br>Today’s section discusses a woman who at first says she is married and then changes her statement and says she is unmarried. Is she allowed to marry someone else, under the assumption that her second statement was true.
This baraita seems to illustrate the principle of “the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permits.” She says that she was married—thereby prohibiting her to any other man. She now says that she is unmarried, she is believed.
The problem with this baraita is that she is not explaining that she once was married and now is not. She is actually contradicting her first statement. And the problem with this is that once she says she is married, she has prohibited herself to anyone else (except her husband). She is now in the status of “forbidden.” How can she simply undo this statement, make herself permitted, by saying that she is not married?
The answer is that for her to be believed, she has to provide a plausible reason for why she at first said that she was unmarried. If she simply says, “I am married” and then contradicts herself, she is not believed to say that she is unmarried. However, if she offers a plausible explanation, then she is believed. The Talmud will now illustrate what a plausible explanation might be.
The example of a plausible reason is that she rebuffed some other men by saying that she was already betrothed. She only said this because she did not want to marry these other men. When she found someone whom she wanted to marry, she agreed to be betrothed to him.<br>Interestingly, this discussion is one of the few cases where we see women given some license as to choosing a partner. It was not her father, brother or any other family member who is deciding to whom she will be betrothed. It was her choice. And the strategy seems to be one still employed to this day—tell someone offering unwanted attention that you are already involved with someone else. Timeless!
Introduction<br>The Talmud continues the discussion of a woman who at first says that she is prohibited in some way but then goes back and says that she is permitted.
According to Rav if a woman says, “I am unclean,” meaning that she is menstruating and therefore cannot have relations with her husband, but then goes back and says that she is clean, she is to be believed, and her husband could have relations with her. Shmuel learns this from Rav, repeats it forty times so that he can memorize it, but still does not believe it enough to act accordingly. It seems from here that Shmuel acted stringently.

Daf 22b

In this case, we have contradictory testimony as to whether a married woman is now unmarried—either by becoming a widow or a divorcee. All rabbis agree that ab initio, she should not get remarried, for fear that she still is married. However, they disagree in a situation where she was remarried without permission. According to the sages, in such a case she may stay married to the new husband, but R. Menahem ben Yose says that she must leave the second marriage by being divorced.
Menahem b. Yose qualifies his halakhah—she must leave the second marriage only if witnesses first came and said that her husband was not dead or she was not divorced, and then she got married before contradictory testimony was offered. In this case, she ignored the halakhah and therefore should be penalized by being forced to leave her second marriage. However, if she was remarried based on the testimony of the first witnesses (who say that her husband died or divorced her) and only then witnesses came testifying to the opposite, she need not leave the second marriage.
The problem is that the man who marries such a woman does not know for sure that she is not married to someone else. So every time he has relations with her he technically should bring a doubtful guilt offering (asham talui), the sacrifice brought by someone who may or not may not have transgressed a prohibition (adultery, in this case). Clearly, this is not a situation that one should intentionally put oneself in.<br>The answer is that she married one of the second set of witnesses, who claims to know for sure that she was divorced or her husband died. Since he claims certainty, he does not need to bring a doubtful guilt offering.<br>The same problem goes for her—she herself should bring a doubtful guilt offering because she cannot be certain if her husband died or if she was divorced (this latter possibility could happen if she appointed an agent to accept her get). Therefore, she can only stay married to the second husband if she claims certainty—she claims to know that she was divorced or widowed. If she herself is doubtful, then she would not be allowed to have relations with him.
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues the discussion of cases where some witnesses testify that a woman’s husband has died or divorced her, and others say he has not.
In both cases, R. Yohanan rules that ab initio, since there is contradictory testimony concerning the death or divorce, the woman should not remarry. However, there is a difference between testimony as to his death and testimony as to his having divorced her. In the case of death, if she remarried before the second set of witnesses came, she need not leave the second marriage. But in the case of divorce, she must leave the second marriage.
The major question concerning R. Yohanan’s halakhah is why there should be a difference between case one (death) and case two (divorce). Abaye interprets case one as a situation where one witness said he died and one said he did not die. The Torah (i.e. halakhah) believes one witness to testify that a woman’s husband has died. This is a leniency to allow her to remarry. Ulla points out that if one witness is categorically believed, the strength of his testimony is equivalent to two witnesses. Therefore, the witness who testifies that her husband is not dead does not outweigh “two” witnesses (one who counts as two) who say that he has died.
If the first witness counts as two, then why should she not be remarried ab initio? After all, there are “two witnesses” who say that her husband is dead?<br>The answer is that a person should always distance himself from a situation that looks bad. In this situation, even though she is legally allowed to remarry, the evidence is hardly conclusive. There is a chance that her husband really is alive. Therefore, she really should not get remarried when there is such contradictory evidence as to her husband’s death.  R. Assi expresses this notion by quoting a verse from Proverbs.
Abaye now explains the second case—why was R. Yohanan so stringent, ruling that even if she remarried, she must leave the second marriage? Again, one witness says that she was divorced and one says she was not. Two are in essence saying that she was married and only one says that she is divorced. The two outweigh the one and we must consider her married.
Introduction<br>This section is a direct continuation of yesterday’s section. It deals with R. Yohanan’s statement that if two say the husband died and two say he did not, and then she was remarried, she need not leave the second marriage. But if two say she was divorced and two say she was not, she must leave the second marriage. Here Rava offers a different explanation as to the difference between the first situation and the second.
Rava disagrees with Abaye who says that R. Yohanan referred to a case of one witness. R. Yohanan, according to Rava, agreed with R. Menachem b. Yose, who had said that if she was remarried she must leave the second marriage, in the case of death, but not in the case of divorce. In the case of divorce, if her husband comes and says “I did not divorce you” she can say refute him. Therefore, if we were to rely on the first witnesses who say she was divorced, she could remarry even knowing that she was not divorced. Should the husband come and claim that he did not divorce her, she could claim that she was divorced. But in the case of death, if he comes back, she can’t say to him, “Hey, you’re dead.” Therefore, we can assume that she will not remarry unless she feels fairly certain that he is indeed dead. So we can allow her to stay married to the second husband.<br>To put this another way, if the risk she takes when remarrying is high, we can trust her not to take it unless she really believes that she is free to remarry. But if the risk is low, she might lie in order to remarry.
According to R. Hamnuna a woman would not be so bold as to baldly lie directly to her husband that he divorced her. So how can we base a law on the assumption that if her husband comes and denies having divorced her, she might lie and say directly to him that he did. The answer is that when there are witnesses who support her statement, she might lie to his faceand claim that he did divorce her. R. Hamnuna was referring only to a situation where there were no such witnesses.
Assi offers a simpler explanation of the situation in R. Yohanan’s halakah—the witnesses say that the death or divorce just occurred. Death cannot be proven (in a case where the body has disappeared) but divorce requires documentation. If the witnesses testify that she was divorced just now, she should be able to verify the truth of their claim. If she cannot, then even if she was remarried, she would have to leave the second marriage.
Introduction<br>This week’s daf continues to discuss situations in which two witnesses say that a woman is free to marry and two say that she is not.
The second half of this baraita is identical to R. Yohanan’s statement from the previous daf. The new part here is the first half. Two say she has been betrothed and therefore cannot marry someone else, and two say she has not been betrothed and is therefore free to marry someone else. According to the baraita, she may not ab initio marry someone else, but if she does she need not leave this marriage.

Daf 23a

Abaye’s explanation here is nearly the same as that which he provided in last week’s daf. Both halves of the baraita refer to one witness. Therefore, in the case where one says that she was betrothed and one says that she was not, they both agree that she was unmarried, and only one says she was betrothed. Therefore, the two are believed and she may remain married to the other man. But in the second case, both say she was married and only one says she was divorced. Therefore, she is assumed to be married and if married to someone else, she must be divorced.
Rav Ashi reverses the baraita in order to make sense of it, but leaves it at two witnesses. Two say they saw her get betrothed and two say they didn’t see her get betrothed. In such a case, if she marries another man she must leave that marriage, because clearly we should assume that she is betrothed.
The problem with R. Ashi’s reversal of the baraita is that it makes it obvious. Obviously, witnesses who say they did not see a woman betrothed have not provided any evidence that she is not actually betrothed.<br>The Talmud resolves by saying that this is not so obvious. One might have thought that when a man betroths a woman everyone will hear about it. If this were true, there would be significance to people saying, “We did not see her betrothed.” The baraita teaches us that this is not true. Sometimes, people can be betrothed without anyone knowing about it.
Ashi reverses the second half of the baraita as well. Two say they know that she was divorced and two say that they didn’t see her divorced. Again, the second two witnesses are not real testimony and therefore, if she gets married to another man, she may stay married to him.
This is essentially the same difficulty as was raised above—the baraita is obvious. And if you were to answer that it refers to people living in the same courtyard, then we would still learn the same lesson we learned above—that people divorce in private.<br>The answer is that we might have thought that while people do betroth in private, divorce is something that everyone knows about. Therefore, the baraita teaches us that just as there are people who betroth in private, there are also people who divorce in private.<br>In the end, testimony that “we did not see her get betrothed” or “we did not see her get divorced” is not full testimony and cannot override the positive testimony of the other two witnesses.
<b>Introduction</b><br>Today’s section refers back to the last clause of the mishnah on daf Kaf Bet, that if witnesses come after she has already been remarried, she need not leave her second marriage.<br>For ease of reference, I am reproducing here the entire mishnah, separated into what the Talmud calls clause one and clause two.<br><b>Clause one:</b> If a woman says, “I was married and I am divorced”, she is believed, for the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permitted. But if there are witnesses that she was married, and she says, “I am divorced”, she is not believed.<br><b>Clause two:</b> If she says, “I was taken captive but I have remained clean,” she is believed, for the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permitted.<br>But if there are witnesses that she was taken captive and she says, “I have remained clean,” she is not believed.
According to R. Oshaia, the clause of the mishnah that reads, “And if witnesses come after she got married she need not go out [of the marriage]” refers to the first clause of the mishnah which refers to divorce, whereas Rabbah b. Avin says it refers to the second clause, which refers to a woman taken captive and the fear that she was raped..
The Talmud, as it usually does, compares the two understandings of the mishnah. The amora who teaches this sage in reference to the first clause, would agree that it could also refer to the second clause. If the rabbis were lenient with regard to the situation of the divorced woman, they would have been all the more lenient with regard to the situation of the captive woman in the second clause.<br>But the amora who teaches it in reference to the second clause, would say it refers only to the second clause and not the first.<br>To put this another way, R. Oshaia would say that if a woman says “I was married and then I was divorced” and then remarries, and then witnesses come and say that she was married but there is still no evidence that she was divorced, she may stay married to the second husband. Rabbah b. Avin would say that she may not.
The Talmud proposes that these two amoraim disagree with regard to the views of R. Hamnuna who said that we can assume that a woman would not be so brazen as to tell her husband that he divorced her. A woman who makes such a statement can be assumed to be telling the truth. R. Oshaia would agree and therefore would say that even if witnesses come and say she was married, we must believe her when she says that she was divorced....
This understanding of their dispute is rejected. Both amoraim agree that a woman would not boldly state in her husband’s presence that he divorced her. But Rabbah b. Avin would say that since in the case under discussion here, her husband was not present when she said that she was divorced, she might be bold enough to lie. Therefore, she cannot be believed in the absence of witnesses who say that she was not divorced. But R. Oshaia would say that she would not boldly lie even when not in her husband’s presence. Therefore, we can assume she is telling the truth and she need not leave the second marriage.
Introduction<br>This section continues to deal with the end of the mishnah which stated that if witnesses come and testify that she was taken captive but she has already married (a Kohen) she need not leave the second marriage.<br>As a reminder, a woman who has had sexual relations with someone prohibited to her (such as a non-Jewish captor) may not marry a priest.
According to Avuha DeShmuel (Shmuel’s father) if witnesses come and say she was taken captive after she receives permission to marry but has not yet married, she may marry a priest. This rule is more leniently than the mishnah actually seems to be, for the mishnah implies that she was remarried. This follows the general trend to rule as leniently as possible in cases of a woman taken captive.
The baraita rules leniently with regards to the captive woman so long as there are no witnesses that she was actually defiled (i.e. raped by her captors). If there are witnesses that she was raped, she may not stay married to her husband the priest, even if these witnesses didn’t come until she had already had several children.
In this fascinating interchange between Shmuel and his father, Shmuel’s father reminds his son that we are dealing with real people’s lives here. As these types of stories tend to do, they bring the abstract and sometimes cruel halakhah, down to the level of reality. It is true that no one was guarding these captive women while they were with their captors, before they were brought to Nehardea. But they deserve to be treated better.
Shmuel’s own daughters are jinxed by his behavior and they are taken captive. But being the daughters of a preeminent rabbi, they know how to act in such a situation. Before their captors are allowed to enter the bet midrash, they each state that they were taken captive but remain pure (they were not raped). This creates a situation of “the mouth that forbade is the same mouth that permits.” The rabbis in the bet midrash rule accordingly and pronounce these girls allowed to marry a priest.
The story proceeds, with the ruling rabbi, R. Hanina, recognizing that these girls knew what they were doing. We then learn that some rabbis doubted whether these women should be allowed to marry a priest. After all, it is certainly possible that they were raped. But the rule remains fast—we cannot worry about witnesses about whom we know nothing.
The Talmud brings the discussion back to the initial halakhah at the top of this section. In the story, the woman remains permitted because there are no witnesses. However, the impression we get is that if there were witnesses, she would be prohibited, even if they come after she received permission to marry a priest. This contradicts Avuha DeShmuel’s rule that once she receives permission to marry, she doesn’t lose the permission even if witnesses come.<br>Ashi resolves this by saying that the witnesses referred to at the end of the story testify that they know that she was defiled. With such concrete evidence, she cannot marry a priest. Avuha DeShmuel referred to a case where the witnesses say only that they know she was taken captive, but do not know if she was defiled.

Daf 23b

Introduction<br>Today’s section opens with a mishnah that continues to discuss the believability of women who were taken captive and claim that they were not raped.<br>Again, I want to reiterate that I realize that just discussing this issue will cause discomfort. Please do realize that these are legal texts and therefore address the issue in a clinical sense, as do I. It does not mean that I am insensitive to the pain a woman would feel at not being believed that she was raped.
This mishnah discusses a case in which it is certain that the women were taken captive and hence they are not automatically believed according to the principle of “the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permits.”  The mishnah teaches that the woman herself is not believed to state that she was not raped, and therefore in this case she will not be able to marry a kohen.<br>However, if each woman testifies that the other woman was not raped, each is believed.  This is true even though generally one witness is not sufficient and generally women cannot testify. The rabbis relaxed some of the laws of testimony in this case because there is no certainty that the woman was raped, it is only a likelihood. Furthermore, these women are believed even though there is a fear that each might be covering up the other’s having been raped. The rabbis were lenient in the case of captives and accepted certain types of testimony that would not have been accepted in other types of cases.
This baraita goes through all of the possibilities of what one woman might say about whether she was raped and whether her friend was raped. The Talmud will now explain each of these scenarios, focusing on the question of whether there were witnesses who testify that they were taken captive.
The Talmud is now going to first ask whether there were witnesses to the women being taken captive. If there were no witnesses, then this is a case of “the mouth that forbade is the same mouth that permits.” She should be believed to say that she is pure.
If there are witnesses, then the second clause becomes problematic. If there were witnesses that the women were taken captive, why should she not believed to say that her friend is impure (was raped)? So, now we go back and assume that there were no witnesses. She is not believed because her friend contradicts her.
If there are no witnesses, then the last clause becomes problematic. Again, she simply claims that she is pure and we have a situation of “the mouth that forbade is the same mouth that permits.”
Abaye affirms that the different clauses refer to different situations. The first and last clause refer to cases where there are witnesses to the fact that they were taken captive. Therefore, she is not believed to say that she was not raped—there is no “mouth that forbade is the mouth that permits.” But the middle clause refers to a case where there are no witnesses. Therefore, she is not believed to say that her friend was raped (assuming that her friend would contradict her).
Introduction<br>Today’s section offers a different interpretation of the baraita that was the focus of yesterday’s section. I am copying the baraita again for ease of reference:
Papa explains the entire baraita as referring to a case where there are witnesses that the women were taken captive, and there is also one witness who always says the opposite of what the woman says. In clause one, she is believed to say that she is impure, because a person always has the power to declare themselves forbidden (or to say that someone else is forbidden to them). And the second woman is permitted based on her testimony, despite the fact that another witness says that she was impure.
In this case, her own testimony with regard to herself is not sufficient proof that she is pure, as we learned in the Mishnah. She would need at least one witness to attest to her purity. The second person has someone testifying to her purity. Therefore, the one witness is sufficient for her to be considered pure.
The next clause works using the same logic as above. A person is always believed to say she is impure. But her friend is pure because of the presence of the other witness who says she is pure. The Talmud asks why we even need this clause—we learned the same principles above? The answer is that we might have thought that when she says she is impure, she is just acting as a martyr, “Let me die with the Philistines.” Knowing (or at least thinking) that her friend was raped, she might claim that she was raped too, perhaps to provide some comfort to her friend. Therefore, the baraita says that she is believed to say that she is impure.
The final clause also uses familiar principles. She is not believed to claim that she is pure, since there are witnesses that she was taken captive. However, the other woman is considered pure based on her testimony.<br>Again, the Talmud asks why we need to learn this twice. At the very outset of the baraita, we learned that she is believed to testify that her friend is pure.<br>The answer is that we might have thought that when she says that both she and her friend are pure, since she is not believed about herself, she is also not believed concerning her friend. Therefore, the Talmud teaches us that even though we do not believe her about herself, we do believe her about her friend.
Introduction<br>This mishnah illustrates the same principle employed in the previous mishnah, but uses the example of men who claim to be priests. It then goes on to a discussion of how many witnesses are needed to prove that someone is a priest.
<b>Section one:</b> When each man claims to be a priest, neither is believed and neither will receive terumah.  Just as in the previous mishnah a woman could not testify with regard to her own personal status, so too in this mishnah a man cannot testify with regard to his own status.<br><b>Section two:</b>  However, if both men corroborate the other’s testimony they are believed.<br><b>Section three:</b>  Rabbi Judah disagrees with the idea that one person is believed to testify that another person is a priest.<br><b>Section four:</b>  Rabbi Elazar limits Rabbi Judah’s statement to a case in which other people protest that so-and-so is not a kohen.  In that type of situation two witnesses are necessary to raise someone to the priesthood. However, in the absence of others’ protesting, one witness is believed to say that someone else is a kohen.<br><b>Section five:</b>  Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel agrees with the opinion in section two according to which a person is always believed to say that a person is a priest.<br>We should note that determining whether a person was a priest must have been an issue of importance and difficulty after the destruction of the Temple.  When the Temple stood, everyone pretty much knew who the priests were, because they were descendants of those who served regularly in the Temple.  Furthermore, when the Temple was destroyed, the records kept in the Temple were probably lost.  Hence testimony about a person’s being a priest became scarcer and more essential.
Introduction<br>This week’s daf begins by explaining why we need so many clauses in the Mishnah, all of which seem to illustrate the same point—the mouth that forbade is the same mouth that permits.<br>Some of the details and logic in this section may be difficult to follow. However, what you should focus on is the larger picture. The Talmud is asking why the Mishnah needs to give so many concrete examples of what is really a straightforward principle. This just emphasizes the very nature of the Mishnah. It teaches case law and usually not abstract principles.
In the first case in the Mishnah of “the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permits” R. Joshua said that a person who says, “This was your father’s field and I bought it from him” is believed. The first half of the statement could cause him a loss of money. He wouldn’t have said that if he didn’t intend to finish his statement. Therefore he is believed in the second half of the statement, “but I bought it from him.” But witnesses who admit to having signed a document do not cause themselves any loss. Therefore, there is no extra reason to believe them when they say that they were forced (or some other disqualification). This is why the mishnah needed to add the case of witnesses.
The Talmud now asks the same question in the other direction—once we have the case of the witnesses, why do we need the case of the person and the field? The answer is that the witnesses’ statement concerns other people, therefore we would tend to believe them. But the person who says that he bought the field is making a statement about himself, to his own benefit. We might have thought not to believe him. Therefore, the mishnah teaches us that we do.

Daf 24a

If the mishnah had taught only the cases of the field and the witnesses, I might have thought that the principle of “the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permits” is invoked only in the case of monetary matters, but not in the case of sexual prohibitions. That is why the mishnah cites the case of the woman who says, “I was married but now I am divorced.”
The case of a woman who says, “I was taken captive but I am pure” again teaches the same principle, so why do we need it. The answer is that we need it to allow the principle found later that if witnesses come and say that she was taken captive but she has already married a priest, she need not go out of the marriage.
Earlier we saw that some sages read the line “But if witnesses came after she got married, she shall not go out” only in reference to the married woman, but not in reference to the captive woman. So why then do we need the clause about the captive woman in the mishnah? The answer is that we would need it segue into the next clause about two women taken captive.
We need the clause concerning two captive women each who testifies to the other’s purity to teach us that we are not concerned lest they are colluding.
The case of two men each of whom testifies that the other is a priest is another case where we do not worry about collusion, a principle we have already learned. So why do we need it? The answer is that we need it to allow the mishnah to teach the dispute between the rabbis and R. Judah over whether one witness is sufficient to prove that someone is a priest.
Introduction<br>Today’s section begins a discussion on the evidence required to allow a person to be considered a priest.
A person comes and testifies that he and his friend are both priests. Although the baraita does not say this, it seems that his friend says the same thing. Thus both testify that the other is a priest. According to the first opinion, both are allowed to eat terumah, but until there is a third witness who can testify that both are priests, neither is allowed to marry a woman with proper lineage, a woman whom would normally be married only by a priest.<br>1. Judah says that we do not even let them eat terumah until we have two witnesses to testify for both men.
According to the Talmud Rabbi Judah says that we need two witnesses for each priest, even to allow them to eat terumah, because he fears collusion. That is why the one priest is not believed to say that his friend is a priest. This is now contrasted with another baraita in which R. Judah seems to say the opposite.<br>In this baraita, donkey-drivers come to town, each praising the other’s produce, either by saying it is old (which is better) or that the tithes have been removed. R. Judah says that they are believed, implying that he does not fear collusion, the opposite of his opinion in the earlier baraita.<br>There are two solutions to the contradiction. The first is to reverse the attributions in the second baraita. The second is to differentiate between the issues. In the donkey-driver baraita we can be lenient because it is only “demai” which is produce bought from an am haaretz (a person who is not scrupulous in observance). Since most ammei haaretz do tithe R. Judah can be lenient in this case.
We now must resolve the position of the rabbis. Why do they believe the priests and not the donkey-drivers? The answer is from R. Hama b. Ukba, who says that he brings his trade-tools with him, in this case tools used to sell his produce. If each donkey-driver praises the others, but also brings trade-tools to sell his produce, then we should be suspicious that they are colluding with each other. If they were each being honest in disparaging their own produce, they would not have their trade tools with them.

Daf 24b

Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section the editors of the Talmud used a statement by R. Hama bar Ukba to resolve a difficulty. But the original context of his statement was not clear. Today the Talmud turns its attention to that context.
The context in which R. Hama b. Ukba made his statement is the contradiction between a mishnah and a baraita concerning the purity of pots left by the side of the road. A potter who wished to preserve the purity of his pots, left them for a few moments unguarded. When he returns he must regard the outer ones as defiled lest an am haaretz, a Jew who does not preserve his purity, touched them with his cloaks which are considered impure. However, the inner pots are pure, according to the Mishnah.<br>But a baraita states that all of the pots, even the inner ones, are impure.
Hama b. Ukba resolves the difficulty by stating that all of the vessels are impure when the potter has his selling tools in hand. If everyone knows that he is selling the pots, everyone will handle them and thereby defile them.
The Talmud now cites another baraita that says all of the vessels, the inner and the outer ones, are pure. This too contradicts the Mishnah.<br>Hama b. Ukba answers this in the opposite fashion. When the potter does not have his trade-tools in hand, no one will touch the vessels, so they all remain pure.
If all of the vessels are pure when the potter does not have his trade tools, and they are impure when he does have his trade-tools, when does the Mishnah’s law, that the outer ones are impure and the inner ones are pure, apply?<br>The answer is that it applies when these vessels are left near the public road. They are impure because of the “border stones” on the public road. Rashi explains that people would put big stones in the public domain to keep travelers from encroaching onto their property or rubbing against their walls. This potter also left his wares in the same place. People walking on the public domain would be crowded and have to make their way over such obstacles. The clothes of an am haaretz defile, and so when their clothes hang over the vessels, they defile them.
This section refers to the dispute at the beginning of section two, between R. Judah and the rabbis. The rabbis said he is allowed to eat terumah and R. Judah said he is not. The earlier explanation was that they disagreed over whether we should be concerned about collusion. Here we have a new explanation. R. Judah holds that once a person is seen eating terumah he can be assumed to be a kohen and would be allowed to marry a woman usually only married to a kohen. Therefore, we cannot allow him to eat terumah until we are sure he is a kohen. The other rabbis say that eating terumah is not sufficient evidence that he is a kohen. Therefore, we can let him eat terumah even without proper testimony.
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues to deal with the question of what evidence is necessary to determine that a person is a Kohen.
The question asked is whether evidence from a document would be sufficient to prove that someone was a priest in order for him to be allowed to marry a woman who only marries a priest.<br>We now need to delve into the particulars of this case. What evidence can there be in a document. The first possibility is that the document has the person’s signature and he signed as a Kohen. The problem is that this is not evidence that he is a Kohen—no one has testified here that he is a Kohen. Only he did.
The document is a loan document in which a person borrowed money and the document explicitly says that he is a priest. Witnesses have signed on this document. However, it is not clear whether they are testifying only to the loan, or whether they are testifying to the veracity of everything stated in the document, including that the borrower is a priest, information not necessary for the loan to go through.
This section ends with an amoraic dispute on the subject—one amora holds that documentary evidence is sufficient to prove that he is a kohen, and one holds that it is not.
Introduction<br>Here we have another question concerning the evidence necessary to prove that someone is a Kohen
If a person is seen in synagogue blessing the priestly benediction and raising up his hands, as remains the custom for kohanim to do to this day in many places, is this sufficient evidence that he is a Kohen?
The question of whether lifting up of the hands is sufficient evidence that a person is a priest is asked regardless of how one rules on the question of whether eating terumah is sufficient evidence.<br>The one who holds that eating terumah is sufficient evidence could say that since a non-priest who eats terumah has transgressed a prohibition punishable by death (meted out by heaven), no one who is not a priest would dare eat terumah. In other words, the severity of the prohibition would deter anyone who is not sure he is a priest from eating terumah. Therefore, this is evidence that he must be a priest. But one who lifts up his hands and recites the priestly blessing even if he is not a priest has transgressed a more minor commandment. Therefore he might do so even if he is not completely certain he is a priest, and lifting up of the hands would not be sufficient evidence of being a priest.<br>Alternatively, this position could say that both acts, lifting up of the hands and eating terumah, are sufficient evidence of being a priest.
The one who says that eating terumah is not sufficient evidence for being a priest could still be asked whether “lifting up of the hands” is. Eating terumah is a private act, and it is simply easier to transgress in private. It does not require so much chutzpah. But it would require a lot of chutzpah for a non-kohen to get up in front of the community and bless everyone as if he were a Kohen. Therefore, we can assume that anyone who does so is a Kohen.<br>Or there is no difference, and neither act is sufficient evidence that one is a priest.
Again, this section ends with a dispute between two amoraim.
Introduction<br>This section continues to ask the same question we saw yesterday—is the lifting up of the hands sufficient evidence to prove that someone is a priest.
This is a continuation of the discussion among the next generation of amoraim. R. Nahman b. Yitzhak asks his teacher, Rava, what the accepted practice is.
As the answer to the question, Rava cites a baraita that interprets a passage from Ezra. In this passage the priestly lineage of some families returning from Babylonia to Israel is called into question. The governor (Tirshata) says to them that they may not eat the most holy things, namely sacrifices, until a priest comes who can divinely determine their lineage. However, they may continue in their presumed state. In Babylonia they eat “holy things eaten outside of Jerusalem,” namely terumah. So too on their return they may continue to eat terumah. This is evidence of how significant a concept “presumption” is. A person retains their presumed status until proven otherwise.
Rava now explains how he uses this baraita as proof that a person seen “lifting up their hands” cannot be assumed to be a priest. Assumedly, these people who came back from Babylonia and ate terumah would also spread out their hands and offer the priestly blessing. Yet clearly, the governor does not assume that they are full priests, for they still cannot eat sacrifices. Therefore, Rava concludes, in general we cannot assume that one who lifts up his hands is a priest such that he could marry a woman only married by priests.
The Talmud rejects Rava, claiming that this situation is different. In this situation we can allow them to lift up their hands without worrying that this will cause people to think they are full priests because their presumption of being priests was damaged. Everyone will know that these particular people can lift up their hands, but we’re not certain that they are priests. For if we did not say this, then this baraita would have been a difficulty on the position that says that one can be raised from eating terumah to being a full priest. These people clearly ate terumah, and yet we know they were not fully treated as priests. Therefore we must say that this is a special category, from which we cannot derive the halakhah in more normal situations.

Daf 25a

The Talmud now returns to interpreting the baraita. What is so great about presumption if all it means is that they can continue to act in the way they were already acting?<br>The first answer is that in Babylonia they were eating terumah whose status was only rabbinical. Outside the land of Israel the separation of terumah from produce is not of the higher status of from the Torah. But when these families come back to Israel they will be able to eat terumah of the higher status–“from the Torah.” This shows us how strong the legal principle “presumption” is.
The Talmud now brings up another possibility altogether for how to interpret this baraita in light of the question of raising a person who is seen eating terumah to the status of full priest. Perhaps in the case in the baraita they ate only terumah of the lower status, rabbinic terumah, even when they returned to Israel. [According to the Torah one does not separate terumah from vegetables, but the rabbis mandated it.] And while we do raise a person seen eating terumah to the status of priest, this is only when he eats toraitic terumah (wine, grain and oil). Eating rabbinic terumah is not sufficient evidence of being a priest.<br>The greatness of presumption is that they are allowed to eat rabbinic terumah, even though they are not allowed to eat toraitic terumah.
The Talmud now questions whether these doubtful priests did not eat toraitic terumah. The verse seems to say that they did not eat “most holy things,” i.e. sacrifices. But they would have eaten terumah, which is not a sacrifice.
The Talmud clarifies that these priests could not eat anything that could be called “holy thing.” This includes terumah, referred to as “holy” in Leviticus 22:10, as well as parts of regular sacrifices eaten by priests, such as the hind leg and the breast, referred to in verse 12. These were the parts of the animal given to the priests from sacrifices such as the wellbeing offering.<br>In the end, the only terumah these people could eat was that of rabbinic status. Eating such terumah is not evidence that one is a priest. But some hold that eating toraitic terumah is evidence that one is a priest.
Introduction<br>This week’s daf continues with the discussion of whether “lifting up of the hands” is sufficient evidence that one is a Kohen, such that he would be allowed to marry a woman who would only marry a Kohen.
The Talmud cites a baraita that seems to offer proof that a Kohen seen lifting up his hands in the priestly blessing is assumed to be a Kohen. This is true even in Babylonia, where the status of terumah and hallah (dough given to the priest) is from rabbinic law, and therefore it is not sufficient evidence to accord him the status of full priest.<br>In Syria (lands bordering Israel to the north) hallah and terumah are of toraitic status (at least according to this baraita, as it is currently understood). Therefore, if a person is seen eating them, he can be assumed to be a Kohen.<br>Finally, if he is seen in a large city eating the priestly gifts, the breast or foreleg of a sacrificial animal, he can also be assumed to be a Kohen. While these parts of the animal can be eaten by a non-priest, Rashi explains that in places where a person would easily be seen by others, we can assume that only a priest would eat these things.<br>The Talmud subsequently rejects this understanding of the baraita. A person seen lifting up his hands is not assumed to be a priest for all matters, including marriage. He is only assumed to be a priest such that he could eat terumah.
The Talmud now again tries to prove that the baraita implies that one seen lifting up his hands is accorded the full status of priest. Just as one who is seen eating hallah can be assumed to be a priest for all matters (and not just for eating terumah, since eating hallah is equivalent to eating terumah), so too lifting up the hands is sufficient evidence.
The Talmud again goes back to saying that lifting up the hands is sufficient only to prove that he can eat terumah. According to this reading of the baraita, one seen eating hallah is also not accorded full status of priest—he too is only allowed to eat terumah. But this is a rise in status, for he goes from eating hallah which has the status of rabbinic authority (derabanan) to being able to eat terumah, which has the status of being of biblical origins. Thus both lifting up of the hands and eating hallah allow us to assume that he is a priest, but only in a limited way—to allow him to eat terumah. Neither is sufficient to allow him to marry a woman who would only marry a Kohen.<br>The Talmud refers to a statement by R. Huna son of R. Joshua. This will appear later on this page.
Introduction<br>We continue the lengthy discussion concerning what constitutes proof that a person is a Kohen.
This baraita discusses what constitutes proof that a person is a priest depending on the region in which the action is performed. In Israel either the recitation of the priestly blessing or receiving terumah grain on the threshing floor is proof. In Syria, Babylonia and other places close to Israel where messengers would arrive to declare the New Moon, lifting up of the hands is evidence but receiving terumah is not evidence. According to R. Shimon b. Gamaliel Alexandria also has the status of Syria and Babylonia because there was a permanent court there.
The Talmud now concludes the proof from the baraita that lifting up of the hands is proof that one should have the full status of priest and be allowed to marry a woman who marries into the priesthood.<br>As with above, they initially try to reject this. Lifting up the hands is proof that one can receive hallah (dough given to priests). But it might not be sufficient for full proof that one is a priest.
The problem with the above is that lifting up of the hands seems to be equated with receiving terumah at the threshing floor. Terumah and hallah generally have the same status. So if receiving terumah is evidence that one is a full priest and can marry a woman who marries into the priesthood, so too should lifting up of the hands be evidence that one should be fully accorded the status of priest.
The Talmud now reinstates the idea that lifting up of the hands might only be proof that someone may receive hallah. The baraita could hold that terumah in our days (post-Temple) is only of rabbinic status, but hallah is of biblical status. So if one is seen lifting up the hands or receiving terumah he is elevated to the status of being able to eat biblical hallah. But he is not elevated to being able to marry a woman who marries only a priest.
The above discussion leads to the citation of a relevant discussion in which some rabbis and R. Huna son of R. Joshua debate the status of terumah and hallah in the post-Temple period. According to the rabbis found by R. Huna in the Bet Rav (the study hall), hallah is of biblical status. This is because during the fourteen years it took to conquer and settle Israel after their entrance into Canaan, they were obligated in hallah but not terumah. This, according to the rabbis, implies that hallah has higher status.
Huna son of R. Joshua uses a baraita to prove that the status of hallah is rabbinical unless all of Israel comes to the land. Just as in the original conquest of the land the Israelites were not obligated in hallah until everyone had entered the land, so too in post first Temple times, the Jews are no longer obligated by the Torah to give hallah, since not all of the Jews returned with Ezra to build the Second Temple.<br>In any case, the baraita at the beginning of the page could be understood in light of the opinion that hallah is of biblical status. A priest seen eating terumah (or lifting up his hands) can eat hallah which is of biblical status. But he cannot necessarily marry a woman who marries only into the priesthood.

Daf 25b

Introduction<br>Yes. You guessed it. The discussion over what constitutes evidence that one is a priest continues.
After this baraita was corrected, it seems to offer conclusive proof that if a priest is seen lifting up his hands in the priestly blessing, he can be assumed to be a priest and he can be allowed to marry a woman who marries into the priesthood. “Lifting up the hands” has the power of actual testimony.
The Talmud again rejects the idea that “lifting up the hands” is sufficient evidence to elevate someone to the full status of priest. It is not “like testimony.” Rather, what the baraita means to say is that testimony that someone performed an action creates a presumption that is treated like presumption itself. This accords with a story in which a man testifies before R. Ammi that he saw a person get the first Aliyah and that a Levite read after him. Since a Levite can take the second Aliyah only if the first one was given to a priest, we can assume the first Aliyah went to a priest. R. Ammi raised him to the status of priesthood, but only insofar as he could eat terumah. He was still not allowed to marry a woman of high lineage.
Introduction<br>Today’s section contains a story very similar to that in yesterday’s section. The only difference is that the person is being raised to the status of Levite and not priest. The story is straightforward, so there is no commentary below.
This story begins like the stories in the previous two sections. However, here Resh Lakish seems to imply that seeing someone read the first Aliyah is not sufficient evidence that someone is a priest. He wants to know if he was seen receiving terumah on the threshing floor, which would constitute a higher level of evidence.<br>Elazar attacks Resh Lakish, noting that if we demand receiving terumah on the threshing floor, what will people do who do not live in a place where people do not have a threshing floor for whatever reason.
The same story now occurs again but this time Resh Lakish and R. Elazar are sitting in front of R. Yohanan, their master. This time R. Yohanan says the same line that R. Elazar said above. This angers Resh Lakish for R. Elazar was basically plagiarizing. Had R. Elazar admitted that he was saying something in the name of R. Yohanan, Resh Lakish might have accepted it from him. Note that Resh Lakish refers to R. Yohanan as a smith’s son, an appellation he receives elsewhere.
Both of these are breaches of the normal rules of testimony—a brother cannot testify concerning his brother nor can a father for his son. But for the issue of verifying whether a person is a Kohen or Levite, the rules were relaxed.
A baraita is cited to prove that Rabbi was the one who held that a father’s testimony is sufficient to prove that the son is a priest. Rabbi explains that if a father testifies that his son is a priest we can allow the son to eat terumah, because the father is a priest himself and would have terumah to give to his son. However, the father cannot unilaterally let him marry a woman, so we don’t accept the father’s testimony that he is a priest.<br>This proves that Rabbi is the sage who holds that we accept a father’s testimony that his son is a priest.
Hiyya must have been the sage who raised a son to the status of Levite, but now we are left with a problem. In the above baraita, R. Hiyya did not allow a son to be raised to the priesthood based on the testimony of his father. So why the inconsistency? After all, both are relatives who cannot testify?<br>The resolution is that the brother was not actually testifying that his brother was a Levite. He was innocently talking and said something through which we could determine that his brother was a priest.

Daf 26a

This is an example of a person who was talking innocently. The speaker remembers when he was a kid and they treated him as a priest, immersing him so that he could eat terumah and hallah. His friends were even making fun of him, calling him a “hallah-eater” (not sure what’s so bad about this, but I guess kids are always making fun of those different).<br>In any case, this is proof that R. Hiyya would allow a person to be raised to the priesthood based on the innocent talk of a relative. Had the relative actually testified, he would not have been believed. The idea seems to be that since the person is not intending to testify, we do not have to fear that he is lying for the benefit of his relative.
Introduction<br>This week’s daf continues the discussion of what constitutes evidence for being a Kohen or Levi.
Shimon ben Elazar puzzlingly states that one who is seen receiving first tithe at the threshing floor, can be assumed to be a priest. The Talmud will immediately clarify some puzzling aspects of this baraita.
The Talmud identifies the position in the earlier baraita with R. Elazar ben Azariah who holds that the first tithe belongs to the priest.
The problem is that R. Elazar ben Azariah seems to have said that the first tithe could go to the Levite or the priest. If so, eating or receiving first tithe is not proof that one is a priest—one could be a Levite or a priest.<br>The Talmud answers that after Ezra punished the Levites for not returning to Zion, he dictated that the first tithe would go exclusively to the priest. This is a notion explained elsewhere in the Talmud. The important thing would be that by the time of the Mishnah, only priests received the tithe (note—R. Akiva would disagree).
The problem is that even though the first tithe was, according to R. Elazar ben Azaryah, given to priests, most rabbis held that it could be eaten by non-priests and it certainly may be eaten by Levites. So how could we know that this person who received first tithe is a priest?<br>Hisda answers that the baraita refers to a person whose father was known to be a priest. The doubt concerning him is that his mother may have been a divorcee or halutzah (woman released from Levirate marriage). A priest may not marry such a woman. The offspring of such a union is not considered a priest.<br>In any case, we know that he is not a Levite—his father was known to be a priest.
But what if his mother was a divorcee or halutzah? Here, we can point the question at both sides of a debate over whether non-priests can eat first tithe. According to the opinion that holds that they may not, clearly they would not have given first tithe to this person on the threshing floor. After all, there is a rumor that he is not a priest.<br>But even according to the opinion that holds that first tithe is permitted to non-priests, this is only to eat it. No one holds that non-priests would be given first tithe at the threshing floor. Therefore, the fact that this person did receive first tithe at the threshing floor is proof that they consider him a priest. [Remember, we know that he is not a Levite].
The Talmud now explains the second half of the baraita, which seems to be equally puzzling. How can taking a share of terumah at the court not create the presumption that one is a priest. R. Sheshet answers that the baraita refers to a person dividing up his father’s property in court. Note that it is possible for one son to be a priest and his paternal brother not to be a priest, if for instance one of the mother’s was a divorcee. Such a son could receive some of his father’s terumah, but he could not eat it. He would have to sell it.
The final question is that the baraita seems obvious–just because someone gets terumah at a court does not mean that he is a priest. However, in the end, the Talmud resolves that the baraita’s teaching is not so obvious. We might have thought that just as some sons are going to be able to eat the terumah they receive, so too all of the sons will be able to eat the terumah they receive. Therefore the baraita teaches that this is not so. We must be concerned that the son about whom there is a rumor that his mother was a divorcee or a halutzah, is not actually a priest.
Introduction<br>While the Talmud does begin her to explain another clause in the Mishnah, it is still dealing with the same topic—the evidence necessary to prove that a person is a priest. This is the last section dedicated to this subject.<br>I should note that the Talmud quotes a section of the Mishnah that it does not deal with. This is a phenomenon that occurs sometimes. These quotes of the Mishnah were placed there to help the reader understand the context of the discussion. But on occasion, the quote is wrong.
Shimon ben Gamaliel in the Mishnah had stated that one witness is sufficient in order to prove that someone is a priest. This, to the Talmud seems to be the same as R. Eliezer (the Mishnah itself reads R. Elazar) who said the following:<br>Rabbi Elazar says: When is this true?  When there are people who object; but when there are no people who object, one raises [a person] to the priesthood through the testimony of one witness.<br>Both of these sages seem to agree that if there are no objections, one witness is sufficient. And as far as what constitutes a successful objection, both agree that two people are needed to object. If one only objects, then the person still may be raised to the priesthood.
The Talmud now cooks up an extremely complicated scenario in order to determine whether or not this person was a priest. He starts off under the assumption that he is a priest, then he is demoted based on a rumor that his mother was not allowed to marry a priest. They then raised him to the priesthood (on the basis of one witness), then demoted again (on the basis of two witnesses) and then another witness comes and testified that he is a priest.

Daf 26b

The Talmud now explains that the real debate is over whether we are concerned that a court that first demotes a person from the priesthood and then promotes him again will be disgraced. According to the first opinion (R. Eliezer/Elazar), it will and therefore, once demoted he may not be promoted again. And according to R. Shimon ben Gamaliel we are not concerned, and therefore although once demoted, he may be promoted again.
 Ashi points out that if this is the debate, why did the scenario have to involve two witnesses testifying separately? The scenario could have been much simpler—two come to testify that he is not a priest and then two other witnesses testify that he is.
Instead R. Ashi says that Rabbi Eliezer and Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel are disputing whether the testimonies of two witnesses who testify on separate occasions can be joined together. According to R. Eliezer they cannot (like the anonymous opinion in the baraita) and according to Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel they can (with R. Natan in the baraita).
Introduction<br>As I have mentioned before, if a married woman was raped she may return to her husband but only if he is an Israelite.  If he is a priest, she is forbidden from returning to her husband.  If she willingly had sexual relations with another man, the she is forbidden to her husband, even if he is only an Israelite. Today’s mishnah refers to a woman imprisoned by non-Jews, asking whether she is permitted to return to her husband.
There is fear that that a woman imprisoned by non-Jewish authorities had sexual relations with one of them. According to the mishnah, if she was taken in order to collect money, the captors assumedly did not have relations with her, because they would fear that if they rape her they will not get the money they want.  In this case, she is not prohibited to her husband, even if he is a priest.<br>However, if they took her and intended to execute her, and then she somehow escapes or is let free, she is prohibited to her husband, even if he is an Israelite.  The concern is that in order to endear herself to her captors, she willingly had sexual relations with them.<br>Others explain this clause to refer only to the wife of a priest. If she was taken for monetary gain, they did not rape her and she may return to her priestly husband.  However, if she was seized for execution, the captors would not hesitate to rape her and she is forbidden to her husband the priest. According to this explanation, there is no concern that she willingly had relations with her captor(s) and therefore, if her husband was an Israelite she is in all cases permitted to him.<br>Rashi explains in the first manner, and I will generally adhere to that explanation below.
Rav limits the context of the Mishnah to a case where Israel is sovereign. In such a case, the non-Jews will fear raping the woman they have imprisoned for fear of a reprisal. Thus the only concern would be if she was sentenced to death.<br>But if the non-Jews are ruling, then even if she was taken in order to pay back a debt and there is no fear of execution, she would still be prohibited to her husband. If the non-Jews rule, then the possibility of rape would be even greater.
Introduction<br>Today’s section is a direct continuation of yesterday’s section.
Rava uses a mishnah from Tractate Eduyot as a difficulty against Rav who said that if the non-Jews ruled over Israel, the woman would be forbidden even if she was imprisoned for monetary matters.<br>My explanation of this mishnah in Mishnah Yomit was as follows:<br>In the sad case under discussion in this mishnah a girl is taken by gentile debt collectors as security on a debt that a Jewish family owes them. The family, assuming that the girl has been raped by the gentiles, distances themselves from her. This “distancing” means that they refused to marry her (those in the family that would have been eligible to marry her, such as uncles and cousins), even though there was no law that prevented them from doing so. This family distanced her even though she had witnesses who testified that she had not been so much as secluded with a gentile, let alone raped.  The Sages respond by telling the family that their position vis-a-vis the girl is illogical. If they believed the witnesses that she had been taken as collateral, then they must believe the same witnesses who testify that she had not been raped.  If they don’t believe the witnesses that she had not been raped, then they shouldn’t believe them that she had been taken in the first place. The Sages do not tolerate the family’s overly stringent and extremely cruel position. While the Sages did believe that under certain circumstances, a girl who had been raped could no longer marry certain men (priests), they did not seek to compound this difficult situation by assuming that this had happened when witnesses testify explicitly that it had not. The family’s distancing the girl is a case of a stringency run amok, and one against which the Sages rightly put down their halakhic feet.
Rava now explains the difficulty. This woman would have been prohibited to return to her husband in the absence of witnesses, because she was taken as collateral. Since the time to repay the loan had passed, we can assume that she had been raped. But if she was merely imprisoned in order to gain a ransom, the case in the Mishnah, then she should be permitted to return to her husband, even though Ashkelon was a city where the non-Jews ruled.


Daf 27a

The resolution is that it does not matter—whether taken as collateral or imprisoned, she is forbidden to return to her husband without witnesses that she was not defiled. Since Ashkelon was ruled by non-Jews, we have to assume that she was defiled by them. This mishnah can now accord with Rav’s opinion from yesterday’s section.
Introduction<br>Today’s section is basically identical to that in yesterday’s section, just reversed. The Mishnah is brought by Rava as support for Rav (in section 3) and then the support is rejected.<br>I have offered no explanation of the mishnah itself, since it was explained at length in yesterday’s section.
Here, Rava explains how the mishnah could support Rav’s statement. Ashkelon was a city in which non-Jews ruled. Hence, even though she was taken for money, she would have been forbidden to return to her husband, were it not for the fact that there were witnesses who testified that she had not been defiled. And it would not matter whether she was taken as a pledge, or imprisoned.
The Talmud rejects the use of the mishnah as support for Rav. If she was taken as a pledge, she would not be permitted to return to her husband without witnesses. In such a case, we could assume that she was raped. But if she was imprisoned, she would be permitted in any case, even though the non-Jews ruled in Ashkelon.
Introduction<br>This section contains a third version of the same passage we have seen above. In this version, instead of Rava using a mishnah to support or object to Rav, the two tannaitic sources are contrasted and then resolved.
The two tannaitic sources seem to contradict each other. The mishnah from Ketubot says that if she is taken for money, she is permitted to return to her husband. But the mishnah in Eduyot (R. Yose testified…–the source is abbreviated since we’ve already seen it twice) is a case where the woman was taken for money and had it not been for the witnesses, she would not have been permitted to return to her husband.<br>Shmuel bar Yitzhak (the same sage who transmitted Rav’s statement in section three) resolves the difficulty. When the non-Jews rule, she is not permitted without testimony that she was not defiled. This is what happened in Ashkelon. And when the Jews rule, she is permitted, as long as she was taken only for money. This is the case in Ketubot.
The end of this passage relates to the last clause of the Mishnah. Rav and Levi both give examples of cases where a woman would be imprisoned only to execute her. According to Rav, wives of thieves are executed. According to Levi, only wives are murderers are executed. Ben Dunai was a famous Jewish murderer referred to elsewhere in the Talmud. But according to Levi, wives of thieves would not executed.
According to Hezekiah, the women are prohibited only if they have already been sentenced to death. In such a case, they will be raped by the imprisoners. R. Yohanan says that they may be raped even before sentencing. He may fear that the women will intentionally sleep with their imprisoners in order to avoid the death sentence.
If a city has been captured by foreign soldiers, there is concern that the women of the city were raped.  Therefore, all of the women married to priests are forbidden to their husbands.  However, if a woman has a witness who can testify that she was not raped, even if that witness is a slave or a female slave, the witness is believed and the woman is not prohibited to her husband.
The Talmud cites a baraita that contradicts our Mishnah. The issue in this baraita is the concern that wine might have been offered as a libation by a non-Jew. So if a Gentile troop comes into town, only the open casks are forbidden. Closed casks are permitted because it is possible to tell that they have not been opened. But in a time of war, we are more lenient. Even open casks are permitted, because the troops would not have had time to offer libations. But this contradicts the mishnah which is concerned lest the troops raped the women of the town, even, or perhaps especially, in a time of war.
Mari basically confirms that there are different halakhot for each concern. The marauding troops will make sure they have enough time to rape the women of the city. But they won’t make enough time to offer libations. In other words, these are pillaging troops—they will give priority to what interests them most.
This is a different resolution. If the troop comes from the same kingdom as the Jewish city, then they will not rape or offer libations, since they are in essence part of the same political entity. But if they are from another kingdom, we would need to be concerned both for rape and that the wine was offered as a libation.
The basic question asked here is that even if the besieging troop is from the same kingdom, how do we know that all of the soldiers obeyed the policy and didn’t rape or offer libations with the wine. There are two parts to the answer. First of all, the soldiers must be guarding one another. In other words, there must be some evidence that the troop is law abiding. Second, they must set up some sort of alarm system around their own troops to make sure that if one soldier tries to run off and rape and pillage, he will be heard and stopped. Without such assurances that the troops are law abiding, we would have to be concerned about rape and about the wine.
This is a slightly different version of the above questions and resolutions. One of these two sages is not concerned that a lone soldier would leave his troops and go rape and offer libations. Therefore, as long as the besieging troop is from the same kingdom, we need not have any concerns. The other says we must be concerned for the lone soldier. Without a system of guards, the women and wine would be prohibited.
Introduction<br>This section continues to relate to the Mishnah according to which the women in a city conquered by marauding troops are forbidden to return to their husbands (if they are priests) out of fear that they were raped.
This halakhah offers a significant leniency—if there is one place in which these women could have hidden from the besieging troops, we can act as if all of the women were there. They would all be permitted to return to their priestly husbands under the assumption that they were hiding when the city was conquered.
Yirmiyah asks what the halakhah is if we know that the hiding place could fit only one woman. Do we pretend that any given woman might have been the one to hide there, even if we know that not all of the women could have hidden there? Or do we not?
The Talmud compares the situation of a hiding place in which only one woman could have hidden with a case of two paths, one clean and the other unclean (due to the burial of a dead body). If one person walks down one path and another person down the other, we know for certain that at least one of them was defiled. The tannaim disagree over whether we must assume that all of the clean food they prepared is considered defiled.
Rava limited the dispute in the mishnah to a case where one person came to ask whether the food he had prepared was pure and at the same time he asked about the other person’s food. R. Judah would say that this is similar to a case where they ask separately, and therefore we are allowed to presume that they are both clean, even though this is not possible. And R. Yose would say that since one person is asking about both men at the same time, this must be treated like a case where both come to ask if they are pure at the same time, and they must both be treated as defiled.
The analogy between the two cases is drawn. In the case of the besieged city, all of the women were permitted at the same time. This is like the case of two men coming to ask if they are pure at the same time. Since we assume the men are impure (even though one is not) we should also assume that the women are impure, even though we know for sure that one is not.
The Talmud now rejects the comparison. In the case of the two paths, we know for sure that one of them has been defiled. Therefore, if they come to ask at the same time, we have no choice but to treat both as if they were defiled. But in the case of the women, we do not know that anyone was raped, we are only concerned. Therefore, since we are only dealing with suspicions, we can be lenient. If there is a hiding place for one, all women may be considered pure and allowed to return to their priestly husband.
This woman admits that she did not hide in the hiding place which would have protected her from being raped. However, at the same time she says that she was not defiled, i.e. she was not raped. Do we say that she should be believed, for after all, why would she say such a lie, when she could have just said that she did hide? Or do we not believe her.

Daf 27b

The Talmud compares the above situation of the woman with a case that came before Rava. Rava believed the man who said that he went by way of Pekod, but that there was no water there, and the donkey did not die from his own negligence. If the man had wanted to lie, he could have said that they went by way of Naresh.<br>Abaye disagrees. If there are witnesses, we do not say “why should he lie.” According to Rashi, there are witnesses in the sense that we know that there is usually water in Nehar Pekod. The man is not believed to say that which contradicts what we know to be true.
The Talmud now points out the difference between the two situations. In the case of Nehar Pekod, we know that there is usually water there. Therefore, his statement should not be believed. But in the case of the woman, we do not know that she was raped. There is only a concern that she might have been. Therefore, we can believe her.
Introduction<br>This section refers to the section of the mishnah which stated that if there are any witnesses at all, even a slave who is not normally allowed to testify, who can state that she was not raped, they are believed.
Even if the only person who can testify that she was not raped is her own handmaid, the handmaid is believed. This is true even though there is some concern that the handmaid would lie on behalf of her own mistress.
A baraita is cited that contradicts the idea that even a woman’s own handmaid should be believed. This baraita refers to a particular situation in which a woman should not be secluded with a particular man. She can be secluded with him, as long as there is any other person present, with one exception—her handmaid. The concern is that if only her handmaid is present, she might sleep with the man in the handmaid’s presence and the handmaid would not tell anyone of it. Thus we see that handmaid’s may not be trusted to testify against their mistresses.
There are two solutions. According to R. Papi, the rabbis were especially lenient in the case of the captive woman. In that case, even her own handmaid is believed. But in the case of seclusion, she should not be secluded with him in front of her own handmaid.<br>Papa distinguishes between her handmaid, who is not believed, and her husband’s handmaid, who is believed. Her husband’s handmaid will not cover up for the woman, because she is not her mistress.
The Talmud raises a difficulty on the notion that a woman’s own handmaid is not believed. A person cannot testify on his own behalf. But a handmaid should be allowed to testify on behalf of her mistress.<br>The answer is that a woman’s handmaid is like the woman herself. Therefore, she cannot testify on behalf of her mistress.
Ashi says that both cases (captive woman and seclusion) refer to a woman’s own handmaid. The handmaid will tend to see things happen and keep quiet. Therefore, in the case of the captive woman if she sees something happen and does say something, she is believed. But in the case of seclusion, a woman should not be secluded in the presence of her own handmaid because the handmaid will keep silent.
Introduction<br>This sugya continues off from yesterday. There we said that a woman’s slave is believed to testify that a woman was not raped in a city that had been taken over by a marauding army. Our sugya asks why she is believed. After all, she could be lying.
We do not assume that a maidservant would witness her mistress being raped and not only not testify as to what she saw, but actively lie about it. She might keep quiet and not testify. But she wouldn’t compound the matter by also falsely testifying.
To prove that we don’t assume a person would doubly lie, the Talmud cites an unrelated story. In this story a brother appears out of nowhere and wants to share an inheritance. The other brother clearly does not want to share the estate with someone he doesn’t even know. R. Hisda answers that it is certainly possible that a person does not recognize his own brothers. This is known from the Joseph story.
This is the continuation of the story between R. Hisda, the inheritor and his alleged brother. At first, R. Hisda tells the person who just showed up that he must prove that he is a brother. This seems to make sense. But then the story takes a twist. The brother who just showed up says that the inheriting brother is a powerful man, and people are afraid to say something that will anger him. In turn, R. Hisda powerfully rules against this strong man. Generally, the person who wishes to extract money, i.e. the plaintiff, bears the burden of proof. But R. Hisda says that he is going to rule against all such powerful men and make them bear the burden of proof, even if they are the defendants!
The story concludes with the same remark we had above. Even if this powerful man brings witnesses, we should still fear that they will lie. The answer is that we don’t fear a double lie. They won’t both hide the truth (that he is a brother) and lie and actively say that he is not a brother.<br>In close, the assumption of this passage seems to be that we generally trust people when they testify in court. This is true to this day. Even though people are not automatically trusted, they are not automatically distrusted either.
Introduction<br>This sugya continues the discussion of whether a woman’s own handmaid is believed to testify about her. R. Papi implied that in the case of the captive woman, even her own handmaid is believed. R. Papa said that only her husband’s handmaid is believed, not her own.
There are two baraitot cited here, both about who can testify in the case of a captive woman. The first baraita explicitly states that a woman’s own handmaid may not testify. The second baraita says that the only people who may not testify are the woman herself and her husband. These are the two parties that are immediately interested in the outcome. Anyone else should be allowed to testify.
1. Papi and R. Ashi both said that her handmaid is believed. They certainly cannot agree with both tannaim, for one baraita explicitly said that she is not believed. But R. Papa who said that her handmaid is not believed might be able to find a way to get the second baraita to agree with him.
Papa could answer that the baraita that implied that a woman’s handmaid is believed referred to a handmaid that “talked in her simplicity,” meaning she didn’t actively testify. Since she did not intend to testify, we do not assume that she was lying.
The Talmud cites a case where such an event really happens. Interest, the story is told by a rabbi coming from Carthage, clearly a Roman stronghold. A son comes in front of Rabbi [Judah Hanasi] and just simply tells the story of what happened. He didn’t mean to testify that his mother was not raped. He just says that he was looking after her during her captivity. Rabbi, in his wisdom, allowed her to marry a priest, based on the son’s testimony. R. Papa could say that the same is true for a handmaid. If she testifies, she is not believed. But if she speaks in her simplicity, she is believed.
Introduction<br>This week’s daf begins with a new section of the earlier mishnah.
This story illustrates the principle in the above mishnah. A person cannot testify about something that they have a personal interest in. Rabbi Zechariah ben Ha-katzav has a personal interest in his wife not being assumed to have been raped. He is a priest, and if such an assumption is made, she is prohibited to him. Sadly, he is not believed. While I admit this story causes us to have great sympathy for both the rabbi and his wife, the principle does seem to be of great legal value.
Despite the fact that they could not stay married, Rabbi Zechariah wanted her to continue to act as the head of the family. She received her own little house in his courtyard, and she seems to have continued to mother the children.
Abaye now asks if one can treat one’s own divorcee the same way that R. Zechariah treated his wife who was forbidden to him because she was taken captive. Was that a special leniency because of the problem of captivity? Or is that always the law—can anyone live in such close proximity to one’s divorcee?<br>The answer is brought from a baraita that rules much more strictly. No man may live in the same neighborhood as his ex-wife who has remarried. The fear is that they will engage in an illicit affair; after all, they do have some familiarity with each other. With a Kohen the rule is even stricter—she may not live in the same alley as him, even if she was not remarried. This is because a Kohen may not have relations with his divorcee, even if she has not remarried.  Therefore, they have to live even further apart.

Daf 28a

The obvious follow up is—who has to move? While the answer sounds sexist, it really is not. Whoever owns the property gets to stay.
A thornier question is what to do if they jointly own the courtyard. The baraita did not address this situation directly, so they have to try to figure it out from the case where it says that she moves out. If this is a case where she owns the property, the baraita is wrong—if she owns the property, he moves out. And if he owns the property, it is overly obvious—we already know that. Therefore, it must be a case where they jointly own the property. In such a case, the prejudice rules and she must move out.<br>The Talmud rejects this. It could refer to a case where they are renting. In such a case it would seem that they both have to move out.
Ultimately the answer is that it is more difficult for a man to move than a woman. While it is true that this is a sexist answer, it’s not exactly saying that the man is “better” or more important than the woman. Rather, it is saying that the husband is in essence weaker than the wife. Moving would be more harmful to him. I’m not saying this isn’t sexist. I’m saying it’s just a bit different than we might have at first expected.
Introduction<br>Today’s section discusses the possibility that a husband would come with his ex-wife to court, so that she could collect money from him.
According to the baraita, if she needs to collect money that her former husband borrowed from her father’s estate, she may not come to court to collect from him. According to Rashi, this refers to a priest who divorced his wife. The rabbis feared that in court they might decide to reunite, and it is prohibited for a priest to be remarried with his divorcee.<br>The amoraim offer various stringencies which the court enacts if they do come into court at the same time.
The baraita that R. Nahman cites here is from a minor tractate called Evel Rabbati, which means “the bigger [tractate] dealing with the laws of mourning.” Today that tractate is called “Semachot”—celebrations—which is, of course, a euphemism.<br>The baraita limits the above halakhah to a case where the couple was already married. In such a case, since they have already been familiar with each other, we fear that seeing each other in court might encourage them to get back together. But if they were only betrothed, she can collect the payments herself, because they were never familiar with each other.
There are two versions of this story. In the first, Rava does place a go-between to separate the betrothed from his former fiancée, and the R. Adda b. Matanah says that he did not need to, and in the end, Rava justifies the need to separate the two. In the second version the actions are flipped.<br>In any case, the interesting issue is that we see that there may have been some “familiarity” between an engaged couple, even though this “familiarity” is supposed to wait until marriage.
Introduction<br>The last Mishnah of this chapter discusses in which situations a person is believed to testify about things he saw when he was a minor. That is to say, although minors are not allowed to testify, there are certain things that a minor can see about which he may testify upon reaching adulthood.
<b>Section one:</b>  A person is believed to say that the signature on a document is similar to the handwriting of a person with whom they were close in childhood.  The assumption is that a person would remember this well.  Furthermore, this is not really “testifying” but just verifying someone else’s testimony, and therefore there is more room to be lenient in accepting such testimony.<br><b>Section two:</b>  A person is believed to say that he was at a wedding and the bride wore the signs of a virgin (see mishnah one of this chapter).  The Talmud explains that he is believed because most marriages are first marriages.<br><b>Section three:</b>  A priest must immerse before he eats terumah.  The time of immersion is right before evening.  A person is believed to say that he saw one of his classmates leave school early to immerse in the mikveh, and that hence he is a priest.<br><b>Section four:</b>  The priests collect their terumah at the threshing floor.  By this person testifying that so-and-so collected terumah, he is saying that he is a priest.  Note that again the mishnah is concerned with verifying the status of priests.<br><b>Section five:</b>  A bet ha-peras is a field adjacent to a field that used to serve as a cemetery but has been plowed over.   The adjacent field may have small pieces of bones there, and therefore a priest may not enter.  A person is believed to identify such a field, even if he only saw it in his childhood.<br><b>Section six:</b>  On Shabbat a person may leave his town only 2000 amot.  This is called the “tehum shabbat” or shabbat limit.  A person is believed when he reaches majority age to say that when they were children they would go this far out of the city.  The reason he is believed is that this is a matter that can be verified.<br><b>Section seven:</b>  The mishnah lists two things a person cannot testify that he saw as a minor.  First of all he may not testify that a certain person owned a path through someone else’s field.  Second of all, he may not testify that a person owned a place where they used to stand and give eulogies.  Such places were owned on the paths that lead from the cemeteries to the cities.  It would have been like a small, private funeral home. In both of these cases, the testimony involves the ownership of land.  For a person to prove that he owns a piece of land, he will need to bring firmer testimony than this.
The first clause in the mishnah teaches that a boy can identify the handwriting of his father, teacher or brother. R. Huna b. Joshua adds that another adult must testify with him.
The Talmud answers the question of why the mishnah needs to teach all three examples. If it had taught just “father” I might have thought that the son can identify the testimony of his father because he is with him so frequently. So I would not have been able to derive “teacher” from “father.” And if it had just taught “teacher” I might have thought that he was believed about his teacher, because he fears his teacher. But he doesn't fear his father so much, so if the Mishnah had not taught that he is believed about his father’s signature, I would not have derived it from there.
The brother is neither with the father all of the time (?) nor does a brother fear his brother (this strikes me as true). Therefore, brother needs to be taught explicitly—he is believed to testify to the signature of his brother.<br>In the end the Talmud says that since the very need to uphold a document is only of rabbinic origin, the rabbis can suspend the usual laws of testimony and let people testify who normally are not allowed to do so.
Introduction<br>The Talmud now begins to go through the cases mentioned in the mishnah we learned yesterday.
He is believed to say that a particular woman was married with signs that she was a virgin because most marriages are first marriages. So his testimony is only, in a sense, aiding in proving that which we already can assume.
The mishnah said that he could testify that he remembers that a certain boy would leave school early to eat terumah, i.e. he is a Kohen. But maybe this boy is not a Kohen, but was only the slave of a Kohen. The fact that we are not concerned with the possibility that his classmate is a Kohen supports R. Joshua b. Levi’s statement that it is prohibited to teach a slave Torah. [I do seem to remember echoes of this in the history of American slavery. Owners feared what would happen if there slaves became educated].
A baraita is cited as a difficulty on R. Joshua b. Levi. The baraita teaches that a slave who performs an act that seems to imply that he is free, is still not free. One of these acts is to read three verses from the Torah in the synagogue. It seems that a slave is allowed to learn Torah!

Daf 28b

The resolution is that the baraita refers to a case where a slave happened to learn how to read and read in the synagogue. But R. Joshua b. Levi referred to systematically teaching one’s slave to read, as if he was one’s own son. 
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues to interpret the various sections of the Mishnah.
The Mishnah ruled that a person can testify that when he was young he would see his friend taken out of school to eat terumah and that this would be sufficient to allow that person to eat terumah. But the Talmud limits this to rabbinical terumah, whose status is lower than that of terumah mandated by the Torah. The rules for “toraitic terumah” would be more significant.
The Mishnah said that the person is believed to say that someone he knew when younger used to take a share of terumah at the threshing floor. The problem is that the receiver may have been a slave of a priest. A slave may eat terumah, but if he is freed, he will not be allowed to eat terumah. The resolution is that this Mishnah follows the sage who says that one does not give terumah to the slave of a priest on the threshing floor. The reason is that if the slave is seen receiving terumah, people might think he is a priest and raise him to the full status of a priest, and allow him to marry a woman who one marries a priest. This is the opinion of R. Judah. R. Yose holds that the slave may receive terumah at the threshing floor, but does have to acknowledge there that he may be a slave. R. Yose correspondingly holds that the fact that the slave received terumah at the threshing floor is not sufficient evidence that he is a priest.
This baraita demonstrates the danger of giving testimony, even when one believes that one is telling the truth. R. Elazar testified only once in his entire life and it almost led to a serious error. As the end of the story explains, he was in the place of R. Yose where they give terumah to slaves at the threshing floor. But R. Elazar then went to R. Judah’s place where they don’t give terumah to slaves. He testified that he had seen this person receiving terumah and the court assumed that the fact that he received terumah meant that he was not a slave.<br>This story may also be a tacit argument against halakhic diversity. Such diversity can lead to confusion.<br>The story is interrupted by the editor ruling out the very possibility that the slave was elevated to the priesthood. In a famous story about R. Pinchas ben Yair, we learn God does not allow even the animals of the pious to stumble, all the more so God would not allow the pious themselves to stumble. Therefore, what really happened was that they wanted to elevate the slave to the priesthood. They did not actually do so.
The mishnah rules a person may testify that a certain field is a “bet haperas.” If one plows over a grave, he makes the surrounding area into a “bet haperas,” for bones may have been strewn there. One is allowed to testify about it because its status is only “derabanan,” of rabbinic origin. We can see this in the statement of Rav. Rav rules that if a priest wants to walk in such a field, all he has to do is blow away the dust. If the status of the field was toraitic, he would not have been so easily able to remedy it.
Rav Judah rules that if a bet haperas was trodden by many, many people or animals walking there, all the bones there were probably trampled on and are now smaller than the size of a barleycorn. Such a small piece of bone no longer transmits impurity.
On Shabbat a person may go only 2000 amot out of one’s town. This is called the “tehum shabbat” or shabbat limit.  A person is believed when he reaches majority age to say that when they were children they would go this far out of the city.<br>The Talmud comments that the author of this Mishnah holds that the entire prohibition is only “derabanan” and therefore the rules can be made lenient when it comes to determining where this limit actually lies.
Introduction<br>This is the last section of this chapter.
A person is not believed to testify that a certain piece of land belonged to another person, either that he had a path there or that he had a place to give eulogies there. The reason is that such testimony is not sufficient to take money from one person and give it to another. In order for property to be transferred, the testimony would have to originate with one who saw the events as an adult.
The baraita adds more cases where a person is believed as an adult to testify concerning things he knew as a boy.<br>He is believed to testify that a certain family was “fit” or “unfit.” This refers to being fit to marry an Israelite—i.e. the family does not consist of mamzerim. The original term that the Talmud uses is “pure or impure” but the Talmud prefers the terms “fit or unfit.”<br>The Talmud will explain below what a  “ketzatzah.”<br>He is believed only if he himself saw these things as a child. He is not believed if he only knows of them through hearsay.<br>Finally, he must have been a Jew when he found these things out. If he was a non-Jew or a slave and then was freed, he is not believed.<br>These last two rules accord with normal Talmudic rules of testimony. A person is not believed based on hearsay, nor are non-Jews or slaves generally allowed to testify.
Yohanan ben Beroka seems to dispute one of the previous clause in Mishnah. The Talmud will now examine his opinion carefully.
Yohanan ben Beroka cannot disagree with the clause that refers to the path or the eulogy place. To cause a transfer of land would always require full testimony. Rather, he must disagree with the earlier clause, according to which if a person witnessed one of these things as a non-Jewish or slave child, he may not testify about them as an adult. R. Yohanan b. Beroka says that he may testify in such a situation.
The first opinion in the Mishnah holds that since he was not a Jew when he saw the events occurred, he would not have paid careful attention. He would have known that as a non-Jew, these issues were not relevant. R. Yohanan b. Beroka assumes that he was going to convert shortly, and so he would have paid attention.
The “ketzatzah” ceremony was basically a way of letting everyone know that a certain person had married a woman not fit for him, and that therefore people should stay away from his offspring. As we have seen, lineage was a very, very important criterion in choosing a marriage partner for Jews living in this period. Indeed, until the modern period, lineage was probably one of the two most important determining factors in marital choice (the other would have been wealth). The ceremony was clearly meant to discourage men from marrying women unfit for them. I should note that the notion that marriage is meant for personal fulfillment and that choice of partner should be based first and foremost on love is a notion that is accepted by most people today, but that would have been strange in the ancient world. It is a modern notion that arose within the last several hundred years.
Congratulations! You have finished the second chapter of Ketubot. There were many important legal principles in this chapter, including “the mouth that prohibits is the mouth that permits,” “Why would she have lied,” “migo,” and “the fear of collusion.” These principles have far-reaching implications, well beyond the topics discussed here.

Daf 29a

Introduction<br>Deuteronomy 22:28-29 states, “If a man comes upon a young girl, a virgin who is not engaged and he seizes her and lies with her, and they are discovered, the man who lay with her shall pay the girl’s father fifty shekels of silver and she shall be his wife.  Because he has violated her, he can never have the right to divorce her.” There are similar verses in Exodus 22:15-16.<br>The rabbis learn from these verses that if a man rapes a virgin he must pay her father a fine of 50 shekels, which is the equivalent of 200 dinars.  Furthermore, he must marry her. Through a careful reading of the wording of these laws the rabbis concluded that this rule applies only to a virgin (betulah) who is also young (na’arah), which means any girl who has reached the age of 12 and has shown signs of pubery.  A girl remains in this status for only six months.  After that she is considered to have reached adulthood and one who rapes her does not pay the fine.<br>Before we proceed, we should remember that the fine was only one payment made by the rapist to his victim.  He also had to pay all of the damages that one pays for injuring another person.  We should also remember that society’s attitude towards rape has changed drastically in the last century. Rape is a horrible crime and while we are discussing the technical aspects of who receives a fine and who doesn’t, we shouldn’t forget what we are talking about.<br>The mishnah teaches that a man must pay the fine to a woman even if he is not allowed to marry her.<br>Another note about the beginning of this chapter. This mishnah relates to a principle that appears elsewhere in the Mishnah—if a person commits a crime for which he is obligated two penalties, he only gets the worse of the two penalties. In today’s mishnah the man violates a woman who is forbidden to him but the penalty for sex with her is karet (a penalty not carried out by the courty), or is a simple prohibition with no penalty. In this case, as we shall learn, he incurs both the financial penalty and karet. Had the sexual crime been one punishable by death, he would not be liable for the financial penalty, because in that case he receives only one penalty.
<b>Section one:</b>  The women in this section are forbidden in marriage to an Israelite.  Our mishnah teaches that although they are forbidden in marriage, he still must pay them the fine.  A mamzeret was defined in Yevamot 4:9.  A netinah is a descendent of Temple slaves.  The Samaritans were considered a splinter group by the rabbis and Jews were forbidden from marrying them.<br><b>Section two:</b>  It is assumed that a non-Jewish woman is not a virgin.  Captives are assumed to have been raped and slave-women are also assumed to be non-virgins.  Furthermore, as we have learned before, the rabbis thought that if a woman lost her virginity before the age of three years and one day, her physical signs would later return.  Therefore if these women made the passage into being full, free Jews or were redeemed from captivity before the age of three, they are assumed to have returned to being virgins.  Therefore, they receive the fine.<br><b>Section three:</b>  The women listed in this section are forbidden to a man, and having relationship with them is punishable by karet (a punishment inflicted by God and not by the court).  Since the court does not execute the man for having had intercourse with these women, he is liable to pay the fine.<br>Note that in order for him to be liable to pay the fine, these women cannot be married nor have been married.  The only situation that he will be liable to pay the fine for having intercourse with one of these women is if they were betrothed to one of these men and then divorced or widowed before proper marriage.  Had they been married when he raped them, he would be liable for the death penalty for having committed adultery.  Had they been fully married and then divorced or widowed, they would not be considered virgins, and hence he would not be liable to pay the fine.
The Talmud merely clarifies the intent of the Mishnah is to list the women who receive a fine despite the fact that they were prohibited to the man. It did not mean to say that if a man rapes or seduces a woman permitted to him, he does not pay a fine.
Introduction<br>Today’s section deals with the question of the age of a girl that receives the fine for being raped or seduced.<br>As an introduction, I want to make a few comments. These sections are highly, highly theoretical. The rabbis in this chapter are basically trying to interpret the Torah’s laws in a coherent manner, but they are not referring to practical halakhah observed in their day, or perhaps halakhah that was ever observed. These halakhot try to make exegetical sense of the Torah, but I do not believe they are trying to ask the question of “what is fair.” For instance, the rabbis place severe limits on the age of the girl whose rapist/seducer is liable for the fine. This does not mean that they thought it was okay to rape girls of another age. They certainly did not. They just work out the exegesis of the Torah such as to say that only a “na’arah” receives a fine. The rabbis did not live in a world in which Jewish men were allowed to sell their daughters into slavery. This is clear from other sections of the Talmud. Nevertheless, the laws of slavery are part of the Torah, and therefore are worthy of discussion. I really can’t emphasize this enough. These are theoretical laws and the arguments are theoretical.<br>We would do well to remember the general ages of the girl:<br>Ketanah (small girl)—from birth to puberty.<br>Na’arah (young girl)—from the onset of puberty till maturity.<br>Bogeret (mature girl)—having reached sexual maturity.<br>Elsewhere, years are used instead of physical signs.
The Mishnah says that if the girl was a “young girl” she receives a fine. “Young girl” in rabbinic literature refers to a girl from the age of 12-12 ½. The implication is that a minor girl does not receive a fine. The Talmud will now explore who holds this opinion....
There are two laws referred to here. The first is the issue of receiving a fine for being raped or seduced. The second is the legal ability of a father to sell his daughter into slavery. According to Rabbi Meir, a father can sell only his minor daughter into slavery. Once she hits puberty, he may no longer do so. And at that point, she receives the fine. These laws do not coincide at all.<br>According to the rabbis, a girl can receive a fine from the age of three until she becomes mature (bogeret). The disagreement is over whether a ketanah (a small girl) receives a fine. According to R. Meir she does not, but according to the other rabbis, she does.
The rabbis agree that a small girl can be sold. They do not mean to say that she only receives the fine. All they mean to say is that the two halakhot can coincide.

Daf 29b

Introduction<br>The Mishnah listed women who receive a fine even though they were legally forbidden to him. The Talmud is perplexed by this.
The Torah says that if a man rapes a woman, he must marry her as a wife (providing she agrees). But if she is prohibited to him as a wife, then how can he marry her. And if she is prohibited, then this whole passage is not applicable to her. So how can the Mishnah say that he still pays a fine the fine.
The word “na’arah” is written twice in the passage about rape (Deuteronomy 22:28-29), and on one of those occasions it has a “heh”—the word “the”—preceding it. This allows Resh Lakish to read it three times. The first time he reads it as necessary to teach the law itself—the fine relates to the na’arah, the young girl. The second time it comes to include women prohibited to him by a negative commandment. This would include the mamzeret, netinah and a few other categories of women. The third time would include women prohibited to him by “karet,” which would include certain incestual relationships, such as sister, brother’s wife, and wife’s sister. The fine applies to these women as well.
Papa offers a very similar set-up to Resh Lakish’s midrash, but uses a different prooftext, Exodus 22:15-16.
The Talmud now asks the typical question—why do the rabbis use different verses? The answer will be that each rabbi uses the other’s verse for another midrash.<br>Papa uses the verse that was the base of Resh Lakish’s derashah for a derashah that is ascribed to Abaye. Abaye reads the verse as saying that if the girl dies before the seducer/rapist pays the fine, the seducer/rapist does not pay the fine. Again, I should note that this is not a midrash meant to make life easier for an actual seducer/rapist. It is tied to legal/midrashic concepts. For instance, if someone dies before the case comes to trial (in this case the girl), the trial cannot really happen. But again, to reiterate, it is highly theoretical in their world.
Resh Lakish used the verse used by R. Papa for the midrash that teaches that the fine levied on the rapist/seducer should be the same as the general bride-price for virgins. Deuteronomy determines that this mohar is 50 shekels. The rabbis read the biblical shekel as equivalent to four Roman dinars. This is the source of the 200 dinar (or Aramaic zuz) ketubah for a woman’s first marriage.
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues to discuss the dispute between Resh Lakish and R. Papa that appeared in yesterday’s section.
The problem with yesterday’s section is that it creates the picture that Resh Lakish would disagree with Abaye or that R. Papa would disagree with the gezerah shavah, which equated the fine with the general bride price for virgins. But this is not true—all agree with both of those other derashot. In fact, there really have not been any actual disputes as of now.
The Talmud creates harmony by saying that ultimately there are enough words to go around for everyone. It in essence combines Resh Lakish’s and Rav Papa’s derashot into one system. This allows two of the words to teach the law itself, two to each Abaye and the gezerah shavah, and it still leaves two more words, one to teach that fines apply to women who are prohibited to the rapist/seducer by a negative commandment and to those punishable by karet.
In the baraita cited here, two tannaim (with similar names) limit the applicability of the law in Deuteronomy 22:28-29 to a woman who is legally allowed to marry the man. This opposes the mishnah here in Ketubot according to which even if the marriage is not possible, he still pays the fine.
The two R. Shimons seem to say almost the same thing, so the Talmud strives to find a difference between them. The difference is with regard to a woman prohibited by a negative commandment to a man, but who nevertheless can be married. An Israelite man can betroth a mamzeret or netinah (similar laws to the mamzeret) but they may not stay married. He would be obligated to divorce her. In contrast, a man could not betroth someone prohibited by incest, such as his sister, daughter or mother. Even if they perform a betrothal, they are not betrothed.<br>So according to R. Shimon the Yemenite, since the man can betroth the mamzeret, i.e. she can become his wife, the fine applies in that case. But according to R. Shimon ben Menasya, since she cannot stay his wife, the laws do not apply. Note they would both agree that if the marriage was incestual, the fine would not apply. This opposes our mishnah.
Akiva holds (unlike most sages) that there can be no betrothal even if the prohibition of the union is only a negative commandment. Therefore, a man who rapes or seduces a mamzeret would not pay the fine (according to the two tannaim from above), if they agree with R. Akiba. If so, what is the difference between them?
According to R. Simai, and with him R. Akiba, the only negative commandment where the offspring is not a mamzer is the offspring of a widow and a high priest. In all other cases, R. Akiba would say two things: 1) The offspring is a mamzer; 2) There can be no betrothal between the man and woman. So to connect this to our issue—R. Shimon the Yemenite and R. Shimon ben Menasya would disagree only if the rapist is the high priest and the woman is a widow. In all other cases, since there could be no betrothal, there is no fine, or any of the other laws in Deuteronomy 29:28-29. This would disagree even more radically with our mishnah.
Introduction<br>This section continues the discussion from yesterday.
According to R. Yeshebav R. Akiba goes even further in claiming that children of forbidden marriages are mamzerim—in all cases of a negative commandment, even a widow to a high priest, the marriage is forbidden and the child is a mamzer. We are left to determine the difference between R. Shimon the Yemenite and R. Shimon ben Menasya from the baraita we learned yesterday.<br>I should also note that we can see in this statement the strong resistance some rabbis must have had to R. Akiba’s stringency. The creation of mamzerim is a tremendous halakhic problem, dooming children to restrictions when they have done nothing wrong. Why legislate halakhah such that even more are created?

Daf 30a

The two R. Shimons would disagree if the prohibition is one that stems from a positive commandment. There is a positively phrased commandment not to allow an Egyptian or Edomite woman to marry into Israel. So if the woman was one of these two women, the marriage would be possible, even to R. Akiba. R. Shimon the Yemenite would say the fine applies. But he would have to divorce her, so according to R. Shimon ben Menasya, the fine would not apply. 
The Talmud now pushes the argument further. R. Yeshebav might have been responding to R. Simai who said that R. Akiba rules that the offspring is a mamzer even in the case of a widow to a high priest but not in the case of a positive commandment. But maybe R. Yeshebav was saying his own opinion, in which case he might have meant to say that R. Akiba says the child is a mamzer even if the marriage is only a transgression of a positive commandment, such as in the case of an Egyptian or Edomite woman. If this is so, then what could possibly be a case where a woman could be married to a man (the betrothal is valid) but she could not stay married to him, such that the two R. Shimons would argue?
A high priest must marry a virgin. This is a positive commandment. But this rule does not apply to all, only to a high priest. Therefore, R. Akiba would agree that the offspring is not a mamzer.
Introduction<br>This section opens a long discussion about an issue referred to in the Mishnah that opened this chapter. If a man commits a crime which would obligate him for two penalties, he would only get the worse of the two. Thus in the Mishnah, if he rapes or seduces a woman and thereby incurs a fine, and at the same time he is obligated for the death penalty, he gets the death penalty and does not pay the fine. The Talmud will now explore the parameters of this concept and its source.
According to R. Hisda, all tannaim found on the previous page agree that if a man rapes or seduces a woman who is a menstruant he pays the fine even though she was prohibited to him. This is because she is permitted to him as a wife and she can remain his wife. In other words, this is different than prohibitions that remain in place, such as incest, a widow to the high priest or the positive commandment prohibitions of not marrying an Edomite or Egyptian.
The Mishnah had distinguished between sexual prohibitions punishable by death and those punishable by karet (extirpation, a punishment not meted out by the court). If the woman was prohibited by death, the rapist/seducer dies and does not pay the fine. But if she was prohibited by karet, the rapist/seducer is punished by karet and pays the fine. This is the case with many incest prohibitions such as sister or sister-in-law. In other words, the rule that he gets the worse of the two punishments only applies when one of those punishments is death. If one is karet, then one still pays the fine.<br>Rabbi Nehuniah ben Hakaneh disagrees. He holds that if one incurs the penalty of karet and a fine at the same time, he gets karet and not the fine. This is illustrated by Yom Kippur, whose transgression is punishable by karet and not death, as is Shabbat. Rabbi Nehuniah ben Hakaneh says that Shabbat and Yom Kippur work the same—if one transgresses Yom Kippur by doing something for which he is also obligated to pay a fine, he is exempt from the fine because he is punished with karet.<br>Note that this would also disagree with R. Hisda above. The penalty for sex with a menstruant is karet. So according to R. Nehuniah ben Hakaneh if a man rapes/seduces a menstruant, he does not pay the fine because he gets karet.
Introduction<br>The Talmud now inquires as to the reasoning of R. Nehuniah ben Hakaneh who said that one who performs a single action for which he is simultaneously liable for karet and a financial penalty does not pay the fine. To understand this passage we need to understand the source of the idea that if one gets the death penalty and a fine, he only gets the death penalty. This comes from Exodus 21:22. If a man strikes a pregnant woman and she does not die (no “harm” or “ason” occurs) then he pays for the fact that he caused her to miscarry. But if she does die, the implication is that he does not pay. This is the source of the idea that a person receives the worse of the two punishments.
As I said in the introduction, the basis of the whole idea that one does not incur two penalties for one crime comes from Exodus 21:22. This verse refers to death (harm) inflicted by a human. The same word “ason” is used in Genesis 42:38, where Jacob expresses concern that if Benjamin goes down to Egypt with his brothers, “harm” will occur to him. Abaye reads this “harm” as referring to death by the hand of heaven. This leads Abaye to conclude that R. Nehuniah ben Hakaneh equated death by a man (execution) with death by the hand of heaven (karet). Just as one cannot be liable for execution and a fine for one crime, so too one cannot be liable for karet and a fine for one crime.
Abaye assumed that Jacob used the word “harm (ason)” to refer to harm by the hands of heaven. But how do we know this was what he was warning them about. Perhaps he was warning them about other forms of harm that could be the responsibility of man—such as lions or thieves. If so, then we have no proof that “harm” could refer to harm at the hands of heaven.<br>The answer is that Jacob was warning his sons about any type of harm, both that from heaven and that from man.<br>Below the Talmud will ask if “lions and thieves” really are “from the hands of man.”
Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section we learned that God controls heat and cold and that lions and thieves are in the hands of man. Today’s section questions both of these assumptions.
The verse in Proverbs seems to prove that a person has control over cold and heat for one who acts well will not be punished with them. I should note that this is Rashi’s understanding of the words I have translated at “cold and heat.” Biblical translations render them as “thorns and snares.”
The Talmud also questions the proposition that “lions and thieves” are “by the hands of man.” A tradition concerning the cessation of the four forms of capital punishment is cited to point out that God sends lions to kill someone who should have been stoned, or thieves to kill someone who should have been decapitated. This proves that lions and thieves are “by the hands of God.”

Daf 30b

The Talmud solves the problem by simply reversing the tradition, which is by the hands of man and which is by the hands of heaven.<br>I should note that the way that the Gemara so easily reverses this tradition might a hint that we just don’t know what is “by the hand of heaven” and what is “by the hand of man.” Sometimes what we perceive to be the apparent truth, the immediate cause, is not really the ultimate cause. And in essence, here the Talmud is saying that ultimately there is no difference. What is “by the hand of man” really means that man causes the bad thing to happen, either directly, or by deserving it through his deeds. And what is by the hand of heaven may often be directly caused by a human being.
Introduction<br>Today’s section returns to a discussion of R. Nehuniah ben Hakaneh who held that if one transgresses Yom Kippur and incurs a monetary penalty with one act, he receives karet for breaking Yom Kippur but is exempt from the financial penalty.
Rava learns this principle from Leviticus 20:5. In this verse God says that if Israel does not execute those who worship Molech, God will “cut him off.” The verb for “cut off” has the same root as “karet.” This teaches us that there is some essential similarity between the two. Just as one who deserves the death penalty does not pay a fine, so too one who deserves karet is exempt from paying a fine. This is the source of R. Nehunia ben Hakaneh’s principle.
Introduction<br>Rava and Abaye both gave midrashic reasons for R. Nehunia ben Hakaneh. The Talmud now asks what the practical difference between their reasoning is.
A non-priest who eats terumah is liable for “death at the hands of heaven.” This is not exactly the punishment of karet, but it is similar. To Rava in such a case he is obligated to pay even though he gets “death by the hands of heaven” because Rava derives the reasoning of R. Nehuniah from a verse that deals with karet. One is exempt only if the punishment is karet and a fine, but not death at the hands of heaven and a fine. In contrast, Abaye derives the reasoning of R. Nehuniah from a verse referring to death at the hands of heaven. Therefore, one who incurs death at the hands of heaven and a fine at the same time is exempt from the fine. This would include, so it seems, a non-priest who eats terumah.
The Talmud raises a difficulty on Abaye, by citing a teaching of R. Hisda. R. Hisda notes that if the act can be separated into two sins, the person is liable for both. This would be true of someone who steals forbidden fat and then eats it. He is liable for stealing the moment he lifts the fat up, but he is not liable for karet until he eats it.<br>This should then be true of terumah as well. As soon as he lifts it up, he is liable for illegal appropriation of terumah, which is punishable by a monetary fine. But he only becomes liable for the death penalty once he eats it.
The Talmud now locates a case where both sins do come simultaneously—someone else picked it up and shoved it in his mouth. In this case his misappropriation of it and his eating of it are simultaneous. Abaye would say that he is liable for karet but not for the fine.<br>This is an excellent example of the propensity of the Talmud to offer resolutions for anything, even if the situation is extremely unlikely.
Introduction<br>This section continues the discussion began yesterday. The idea there was that if an action for which there are two transgressions can be divided into two distinct actions, each of which incurs a different punishment, he gets both punishments. We would not say in that case that he only gets the worse of the two. Yesterday the section ended with the resolution that if someone put the terumah into his mouth, then both sins would have come simultaneously—stealing and a non-priest eating terumah. Today’s section questions this.
The Talmud pushes the idea of separating one act into two even further. Here they suggest that when he chews the terumah, he acquires it. This is the act of stealing, for which he would be liable for a financial penalty. Once he swallows it, he is liable for eating the terumah and would get “death by the hands of heaven.” So we still do not have a case in which someone is exempt for a fine when eating terumah.<br>The answer is that someone else shoved the terumah straight into his esophagus. Yes, this barely seems possible. But it seems to momentarily satisfy the Talmud’s need to resolve everything.
The question now is why should he be obligated at all if someone else shoved terumah down his throat. If he can give it back, he should just give it back, but if he can’t, he wouldn’t be obligated at all.<br>The answer is that he could give it back, but with great difficulty. In such a case he is liable for benefiting from it, but not for stealing it.
These two amoraim offer new resolutions. Rav Papa suggests that it was liquid terumah. With no chewing, he is liable only when he swallows. So stealing and benefiting from terumah are simultaneous.<br>Ashi offers a resolution that is in a completely new direction. The person does two discreet acts at the same time, for one he is liable for death (at the hands of heaven) and for the other he is liable for a financial penalty. R. Ashi seems to be unique in saying that in such a situation he only gets the worse of the two punishments, even though the two acts have nothing whatsoever to do with each other. Above, the Talmud seemed to hold that in such a case he would be liable for both acts.

Daf 31a

Introduction<br>This week’s daf continues discussing R. Nehuniah ben Hakaneh’s principle that if one performs one action for which he is liable for karet and a fine (such as raping/seducing a virgin woman who is prohibited to him because she is related to him or a menstruant), he is punished only b karet, the worse of the two punishments. The question continues to be—what constitutes a single act such that one would only receive one punishment. And what constitutes two acts?
This is the tradition we saw in last week’s daf. Since he is first liable for stealing and then for eating forbidden fat, he is not exempt from the fine.
Abin refers to a case where someone transgresses Shabbat and is liable for a monetary payment at the same time. He shoots an arrow four cubits in the public domain, an infraction of the Shabbat laws. At the same time, he destroys property. But according to R. Abin, he is exempt from the payment because in order to put the arrow down, the final act that makes him liable, he had to pick it up. So too would be the case in the case where he stole the fat and then ate it. He had to pick up the food in order to eat it. Nevertheless, R. Hisda says that he is liable for the stealing. This might imply that R. Hisda and R. Abin disagree.
The Talmud now draws some distinctions between the two situations. With the arrow, it is impossible for it to travel four cubits in the public domain without being first uprooted. Therefore it is considered one act. But one could eat the forbidden fat without first picking it up. Therefore, the picking up is not essential to the transgression and can be treated as a separate act for which he is liable.
The other difference is that once the arrow has been shot, it cannot be taken back. This means uprooting and landing are part of the same action. But even after the fat has been picked up, it need not be eaten. Therefore they are two distinct actions.
The Talmud now points out the practical difference between the two answers above. The case is one who carries a knife in the public domain on Shabbat and tears silk on the way. The knife could not have been put down after traveling four cubits if it had not been picked up at the beginning of four cubits. Therefore, it could be considered one act. But it is not an action that cannot be taken back. One could walk two cubits, tear the silk and then not walk the next two cubits. Therefore it could be considered from a different perspective two acts.
Introduction<br>Today’s section goes back to discussing the case of the arrow shot through the public domain on Shabbat that also tears silk on its way.
This is the statement we saw above—since he couldn’t have transgressed Shabbat without uprooting the arrow (i.e. shooting it), we consider the shooting from beginning to end to be all one action, from the throwing until the landing. And since the silk was torn during this action, he can only be made liable for one punishment, in this case death. He is exempt from the fine.
Bibi b. Abaye raises a difficulty on R. Abin from a baraita. According to the baraita, if he picks up a purse and carries it from one domain to the other, he is liable to pay the penalty for stealing because first he became liable for stealing and then he carried it. These are two separate actions and he is liable therefore for both of them.<br>But if he dragged the purse out into the public domain he is not liable for the fine because the Shabbat transgression and stealing happened simultaneously, as soon as he took the purse out of the private domain.<br>But if we invoke the principle from before, then he should be exempt in the first case as well. The lifting is necessary for the carrying out. So why should he be liable. This is the difficulty on R. Abin.
The Talmud limits the case in which he is liable for the fine. When he lifted it up he was intending to hide it in the private domain and not take it out. At that point he became obligated for stealing. Then he changed his mind and took it out of the house. At that point he is liable for carrying (this will be modified below, but for now, this is what the Talmud says). But if he had picked it up with the intent of carrying it out in the first place, he would have been exempt from the fine because we would consider this one act.
Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section the Talmud limited the case where one is liable for the fine and for the greater punishment to a case where he picked the purse up in order to hide it and then took it out into the public domain. In such a case he is first liable for the fine, and then he becomes liable for the Shabbat transgression of carrying. Our section asks if he is really liable for the Shabbat transgression if he picked it up without intending to carry it out.
As an objection the Talmud cites a statement by R. Yohanan that if one intends to perform an action that would not make him liable for Shabbat and begins to do that action, and then changes his mind and performs an action that would make him liable for Shabbat, he is exempt. The person here intended to carry within the private domain, which is permitted, and then took something out to the public domain, forbidden. To be liable the entire action must be performed with the intent of transgressing Shabbat. Therefore, if he picked the purse up with the intent of not taking it out of the private domain and then he did take it out he has not even transgressed Shabbat.
The Talmud now offers a different case where the stealing precedes the Shabbat transgression. The man picks up the purse in the private domain with the intent of stealing it and taking it out to the public domain. He is now liable for stealing. Then he starts to carry it out but stops before he puts it down in the public domain. This detaches the initial lifting up from the putting down. Therefore, these are considered two acts and he is liable for stealing and for transgressing Shabbat.
The Talmud now explains why he stood. If he stood for a second to adjust the weight on his shoulders, then since this is the usual way of carrying, it would still be considered one action and the liability for Shabbat would come at the same time as the liability for stealing. Therefore he must have stood in order to rest.

Daf 31b

<br>Introduction<br>The Talmud continues the discussion of when someone is liable for both stealing and transgressing Shabbat by carrying into the public domain. Yesterday we learned that if he picks up the object and walks out into the public domain we can consider it two actions because walking is like standing.
The Talmud accepts that the previous solution and now offers a new one. Why does the baraita say that he is liable for the fine and the Shabbat transgression? Because it holds like Ben Azzai who says that one who walks is like one who stands. Each step he takes is considered like a new step. Therefore, from the moment he lifts up the object he has acquired it and become liable for stealing. He is not liable for the Shabbat transgression until he steps over the boundary and goes into the public domain. This allows us to consider the action to be two actions and not one.
The answer is that the baraita needed to teach the case of dragging the purse out to let us know that this is considered carrying something out into the public domain on Shabbat and is a transgression. We might have thought that to be liable for carrying the person would have to actually pick the object up.
The next question is what size of a purse was he dragging out? If it was too big to be carried, then dragging it out is the normal way of carrying such a purse and it is obvious that he is liable. And if it is small, then he really shouldn’t be liable because dragging out a small purse is an abnormal action, and one is never liable for Shabbat transgressions when the action is done in an abnormal way. Rather, it must have been a medium sized purse, one that could be carried with some difficulty but would also be dragged. Picture something like a pretty heavy suitcase.
The question now becomes where was he dragging it to? If he dragged it into the public domain, the Talmud believes that he is exempt from stealing because he has not yet even acquired the object. But if he drags it into a private domain, he has not transgressed Shabbat, at least not toraitically, because according to the rabbis the Torah prohibits only carrying from the private domain into a public domain.<br>The answer is that he drags it into the sides of the public domain. By doing so he has acquired the object, because this area is divided off from the public domain. But it still counts as the public domain such that he is obligated for carrying/dragging something there from the private domain.
Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section the Talmud limited the baraita to a case where he dragged the purse out to the sides of the public domain. In this way he has transgressed Shabbat and he has also acquired the purse such that he would be liable to pay the fine. In other words, the sides of the public domain count as the public domain for the Shabbat laws but not with regard to the laws of stealing. Today’s section explores whose opinion this is.
There is a dispute between R. Eliezer and the rabbis about the status of the sides of the public road (or domain). R. Eliezer says they count as the public road and the other rabbis say that they do not. But our baraita, as we understood it above, matches neither of those opinions, because as I stated above, the baraita considers the sides to be like the public domain for matters of Shabbat but not for stealing. So whose opinion does this baraita match?
The baraita does indeed accord with R. Eliezer. R. Eliezer holds that with regard to the Shabbat laws, the sides of the public domain have the status of the public domain. The reason is that sometimes the public thoroughfare becomes crowded and people use the sides. Since it does at times serve the public, it counts as the public domain. But since the public is not often there, it counts as a private domain in that one can acquire something there. Therefore, the robber of the purse who drags the purse to the sides of the public domain has transgressed Shabbat and acquired the object.
Ashi offers a different solution as to how one could be simultaneously liable for stealing and transgress Shabbat. The baraita did not refer to someone who dragged the object to the sides of the public road. Rather it refers to a case where the person lowered his hand and put the object into it in the public domain. This is true even though his hand is close to the ground and he has not therefore picked it up (if he picks it up, then he is acquiring it in a separate act). When he puts the object into his hand, he acquires it since his hand is considered a separate domain. Now the Shabbat transgression and the stealing occur simultaneously, such that he is liable only for the worse of the two punishments.
<br>Introduction<br>The last section of this daf continues to discuss the baraita about one who stole a purse by dragging it out into the public domain on Shabbat.
Aha is a late amoraic sage. He taught the baraita as did R. Ashi, that it refers to a person who dragged the object into his hand that was less than three handbreadths from the ground.<br>Ravina returns to a simpler reading of the baraita. He dragged it out into the public domain. Unlike, R. Aha, Ravina holds that one can acquire things in the public domain, and therefore, he need not limit the case to one where he put the object directly into his hand when it was only three handbreadths from the ground.
The Talmud now seeks the source for the debate between R. Aha and Ravina over whether one can acquire the object in the public domain (without picking it up). The debate is over a deduction made from a mishnah in Bava Kamma. The mishnah describes a thief stealing from a person’s private domain. If the thief is pulling it out but the animal dies before he takes it out, the thief is exempt because he has not yet acquired the animal. But if he lifts it up in the owner’s domain or if he takes it out of the domain and then it dies, he is liable in both cases because he acquired the animal before it died.
According to Ravina the reason he is exempt is that he did not take the animal out of the owner’s domain. Had he taken it out of the owner’s domain he would have been liable, even if he took it into the public domain. Hence, one can acquire in the public domain.
Aha derives from the second clause that in order to acquire the object and be liable for stealing he must take it into his own domain. Just as when he lifts it up it goes into his domain, so too when he takes it out, he must bring it into his domain and not the public domain. He would have to pick the animal (or object) up in order to acquire it.
The Talmud now turns things around and raises a difficulty for both amoraim from the clause of the mishnah that supported the opposite position.<br>Aha holds that one does not acquire in the public domain. He would say that it is still considered to be in the owner’s property until the thief brings it into his property. If he brings it into the public domain, he is still liable.<br>Ravina would simply say that bringing out is not the same as lifting up. He is liable when he brings the object out of the owner’s domain, even if he does not yet bring it into his own domain (by lifting it up). In other words, he is liable when he brings it into the public domain.
Introduction<br>This week’s daf continues with the next section of the Mishnah, but the topic of discussion is similar to the previous topic. A man who has sex through force or seduction with his virgin sister (or father’s sister etc.) is liable to pay the fine for raping or seducing a virgin. Elsewhere we will learn that a man who commits this crime is lashed (this is the human punishment for people liable for karet, the punishment for sex with sister, father’s sister etc.). The problem is that we have a principle that one gets the worse of two punishments.
The mishnah here in Ketubot says that he pays the fine for sleeping with his sister, etc. But the mishnah in Makkot says that he is lashed. And yet we have another principle according to which one does not get lashed and pay a fine for the same crime. Thus these two mishnayot seem to contradict each other.

Daf 32a

Ulla offers a fairly straight forward resolution. A man is liable for the fine only if she is a na’arah, a young girl. He is not liable if she is a mature girl (roughly speaking, over the age of 12.5). So the Mishnah that says he pays the fine refers to the young girl—he pays the fine but is not lashed. And the Mishnah in Makkot that says that he is lashed refers to a mature girl, for whom there is no fine.
The payment for rape or seduction is not limited to a fine. There are also other damage payments, mostly similar to those relevant to cases of personal injury. So even if she is a mature girl, he still has to pay shame and damage. Again, how can he pay and get lashes?<br>The answer is that the Mishnah refers only to a woman who is not of sound senses. According to the Talmud, she is not capable of embarrassment, nor does she really suffer “damage” when seduced or raped. [Damage is assessed by how much a person would get on the slave market. According to the Talmud, someone not of sound senses would not have had any value as a slave in any case. Therefore, there are no damages and she is not aware enough to suffer shame].
There is still another payment, relevant to the mature girl—pain. So how can he be lashed if he still has to pay for the pain?<br>The answer is that the Mishnah refers only to a girl seduced. Since she was not raped, there is no payment for pain. The payment for pain is only in the case of rape.
Now that we limit the Mishnah in Makkot (he gets lashed) to a case where she was seduced, we can say that it refers to a broader set of cases, namely a seduced young girl without a father. Since she was willing, there is no embarrassment, shame or pain. And since she was an orphan, there is no fine, because the fine would go only to the father. So there is no payment and therefore he gets lashes.
Introduction<br>Today’s section discusses Ulla’s resolution of the mishnah in Ketubot (fine) with the mishnah in Makkot (lashes), questioning what seems to be its implication—when one commits a transgression for which he is liable for both lashes and a fine, he pays the fine and is not liable for lashes.
Ulla derives his general principle from the case of personal injury. When someone injures another person, he must pay five different penalties (these are listed in Bava Kamma, chapter eight). Theoretically, he should also be lashed for the criminal act of harming another person. But he only pays the fine. This serves as a precedent for all who incur both a fine and lashes for the same crime. In all such cases, he pays the fine and is not lashed.
The problem with using personal injury as a precedent is that the laws of personal injury are more stringent than other fines, because he has to pay for five things. This might be why in this case, he pays and does not get lashed. But in other cases, where the financial penalty is less, he might get lashes and not have to pay the fine.
And if you try to say paying is a more lenient punishment than lashes, even if one pays five payments, and therefore we could learn that just as with personal injury one pays and is not lashed, so too with all cases one pays and is not lashed, we could still raise a difficulty. There is a way that personal injury is more lenient than other cases—the court is allowed to injure a person as a punishment. This would mean that we cannot use personal injury as a source for Ulla because it is an exceptional law.
Introduction<br>The Talmud continues to search for a source for Ulla’s ruling that whenever someone does one action (such as rape/seduce his virgin sister) for which he is liable for a fine and lashes, he pays the fine and does not receive the lashes.<br>These sections are difficult, but I do hope that the reader appreciates the artistry of the rhetorical arguments being made. These arguments are based on elaborate structures of logic that try to prove an unknown from other known assumptions. In my opinion, they are better perceived as formal examples of logical/critical thinking than actually dealing with any concrete problem. Perhaps in many ways similar to mathematics.
“Plotting witnesses,” who falsely testify to an event that they didn’t even see, are punished by receiving the punishment they tried to dish out on the defendant. If they claimed the defendant owed money, then they themselves owe that money. Theoretically, they should also be liable for lashes for having transgressed the prohibition of testifying falsely. Nevertheless, they pay money and are not lashed. This could serve as a precedent for all cases—one pays and is not lashed.
This is the first counterargument—the case of plotting witnesses is more stringent because they do not need to be warned in order to be punished. Thus we might say that the Torah was stringent with plotting witnesses that they should pay money, which could be a more stringent penalty than lashes. But that would not mean that in other cases the Torah would be so stringent, and the person would receive lashes and not the fine.
And if you say that money is a more lenient form of punishment, then we could say that the reason the Torah is lenient with the plotting witnesses is that they didn’t perform any physical. They just spoke lying words. But, in other cases, where a person acts, we might say he receives lashes, the more serious penalty, and not the fine.
The Talmud now does something it often does in these types of arguments. After failing to derive a law from two independent precedents, it tries to combine the two and use them together to derive the law. So just as both plotting witnesses and those who cause personal injury pay a fine and do not receive lashes, so too in all cases, a person pays a fine and is not lashed.
This is basically the same two counterarguments we saw above. First of all, both plotting witnesses and personal injurers have a side that is more stringent. So maybe paying the fine is the more stringent penalty, but in other cases that are not as stringent, a person would be lashed and not fined.<br>Alternatively, we could say that both have lenient sides and therefore are punished with the more lenient punishment—money. But in other cases a person would receive the more stringent punishment—lashes. Again, we don’t really know which is the more serious punishment, and both personal injury and plotting witnesses have aspects that are stringent as well as lenient. This prevents us from using them as precedents for other cases.

Daf 32b

The Talmud now offers an entirely different source for Ulla’s rule—a gezerah shavah. This is a type of linguistic comparison based on the same word being used in two different contexts. It allows the transfer of laws from one context to the other. The word “tahat” is used in the context of rape in Deuteronomy 22:29. This is the case where we are trying to prove that he pays the fine and does not receive lashes for having relations with his sister (or father’s sister). The same word is used in the context of personal injury, where we already know that he pays and does not receive the fine. Therefore, just as in the case of personal injury, one pays and does not get lashes, so too in all cases (or at least in the case of one who rapes a virgin woman prohibited by karet).
Introduction<br>Yohanan here offers a different resolution to the contradiction between the mishnah in Ketubot (a man who rapes/seduces his sister pays a fine) and the mishnah in Makkot (he is lashed). Ulla had said that the mishnah in Makkot referred to a girl who was of majority age, and therefore does not receive a fine, whereas Ketubot referred to a girl who was a na’arah (12-12.5) and therefore does receive a fine. R. Yohanan rejects this resolution and offers a different one in its place.
Yohanan says that both mishnayot refer to cases where the girl was a na’arah, and therefore he should, at least in principle, pay the fine. However, Makkot (he is lashed) refers to a case where he was warned before he transgressed and Ketubot refers to a case where he was not warned. Since he was not warned, he cannot be lashed, and therefore pays a fine.<br>As a note, according to the rabbis no physical punishment (lashes or execution) can ever be carried out unless the perpetrator is first warned by witnesses that if he commits the crime, he will be punished. This is one example of the rabbis’ severe hesitancy to even theoretically punish criminals.
The Talmud now notes the implication of R. Yohanan’s alternative solution to the contradiction between the two mishnayot. Unlike Ulla, R. Yohanan holds that when a person is to be lashed (i.e. he was warned) and to pay a fine, he is lashed and does not pay the fine.<br>The question now is the same as it was with regard to Ulla—what is his source?
The source for R. Yohanan is a verse in Deuteronomy which refers to lashing one who has committed a transgression. The word for “guilt” is singular, so the midrash interprets it to mean that a person receives one punishment (one “guilt”) and not two. Since the punishment is lashes, we can conclude that if he deserves two punishments, lashes and a fine, he is lashed and not fined.
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues to discuss R. Yohanan’s ruling that one who deserves lashes and a fine is lashed and not fined. Basically, since R. Yohanan’s rule is the opposite of Ulla, the sources of support for Ulla become difficulties for R. Yohanan.
As we already know, when one injures another person he pays the fine and does not receive lashes. This seems to contradict R. Yohanan.
Yohanan had said earlier that he is lashed only if he was warned by witnesses before he committed the crime. The Talmud here refutes a potential resolution to the above difficulty. We might have thought that one who injures another person is fined only if he is not warned. But R. Yohanan himself implied the opposite. If a person strikes another person with a blow where the damages are worth less than a perutah (a very small coin), then no fine can be levied against him. Therefore, in that case, he is lashed. But the implication is clear—if the fine is worth more than a perutah, then he pays the fine and is not lashed, even if he is warned!
The resolution is that the Torah explicitly says that plotting witnesses have to pay money and are not lashed (the Talmud will explain where below). So too when it comes to personal injury, the Talmud explicitly states that he must pay money and is not lashed.<br>In other words, this is an exception. In other cases (such as one who rapes/seduces his virgin sister, and she is a na’arah) if he was warned, he would suffer lashes and not pay the fine.
Introduction<br>Ulla had said that the Torah explicitly states that plotting witnesses pay money. The Talmud now locates the context and source of his words.
The original context of R. Ila’s statement is a debate between the sages and R. Meir concerning plotting (lying) witnesses who falsely testify that someone owes money. According to R. Meir since there are two different verses, one that says that they receive the punishment that they tried to mete out and the other that warns people not to falsely testify, they receive both lashes and the fine. The other sages say that anyone who pays does not receive lashes.
Ila now explains how we know that plotting witnesses have to pay (and therefore, due to the principle that one gets only one punishment for each crime, are not lashed). The Torah explicitly says that plotting witnesses are punished with the punishment they tried to mete out. It then says “hand for a hand.” We know that the rabbis interpret this to mean that he pays the value of a hand, not that his hand is cut off. Therefore, we know that plotting witnesses have to pay.
The same logic is now applied to one who injures another. We know from rabbinic exegesis that he must pay. Since he must pay, he does not receive lashes<br>But remember, these are two exceptions, according to R. Yohanan. In other cases, one is lashed and does not pay.

Daf 33a

Introduction<br>Today’s section inquires as to why R. Yohanan, who said that one is lashed and doesn’t pay, does not agree with Ulla who said that he pays the fine and is not lashed. I should note that there is a lot of what I would call “rhetoric” in this sugya. Meaning there many answers to the question are obviously not correct. The sugya takes time before it gets to the correct answer.
If the person who rapes/seduces his virgin sister pays the fine and is not lashed, then there is no case where the verse that prohibits one from having sex with his sister would apply. This verse implies (according to rabbinic understanding) that one is punished for transgressing the commandment with lashed.<br>The problem is that we could say the same thing about personal injury and plotting witnesses, two cases where even R. Yohanan agrees that the perpetrators are fined and not lashed. In both cases we could say that if the person is fined, the verse that would seem to indicate lashes for that particular transgression would not be fulfilled.
The Talmud now finds a way that the verses that require lashes could be fulfilled and yet still in most cases the person would pay.<br>When it comes to plotting witnesses, it is possible that they could be lashed when they testify about something for which they cannot receive the punishment they tried to mete out. For instance, if they testify that a person is the son of a divorced woman or the son of a halutzah (a woman rejected from Levirate marriage) who had been married to a priest, the son does not have the status of his father. In other words, they are testifying that someone is not a priest. It does not make sense to say as a punishment the witnesses are not priests, especially if they were not priests to begin with. Therefore, they are lashed.<br>If witnesses falsely testify that someone injured someone but that the damages were less than a perutah, the witnesses are punished with lashes because they cannot be fined. Less than a perutah is nothing.<br>Thus in both of these cases we could say that in principle the person would pay, but under certain circumstances, the verse requiring lashes could be fulfilled.<br>The problem is that the same could be said about rape/seduction. We could say that if he rapes/seduces his virgin sister who is a na’arah (young girl) he pays the fine and is not lashed (against R. Yohanan). But if she was a mature girl, he would be lashed because the fine is not applicable.
Yohanan now gives an entirely different answer as to why he did not agree with Ulla. The verse Ulla used was “Since (tahat) he had relations with her.” The word “tahat” was compared with the same word used in the case of personal injury to prove that the rapist/seducer pays the fine and is not lashed. But R. Yohanan uses the verse for a different purpose—besides the fine, the rapist pays for shame and physical damages. Since he uses the verse for one “midrash,” it is not available for another.
And Ulla?   He derives it from a teaching of Rava, for Rava said: The verse says: “Then the man that lay with her must give to the father of the girl fifty shekel of silver” (Deuteronomy 22:29); for the enjoyment of lying [with her he pays] fifty [shekel of silver], [and from here we infer], by implication, that there is also payment for shame and damages.<br>Ulla could derive Abaye’s halakhah from a different verse that teaches the same thing. This frees the word “tahat” up so that Ulla could use it for his own midrash—the rapist pays and is not lashed.
Introduction<br>Today’s section discusses why plotting witnesses pay a fine (if they testified that another person was obligated to pay a fine) and are not lashed.
Elazar explains that plotting witnesses cannot be lashed because they cannot be warned, as Rava will explain below. As we have learned elsewhere, the rabbis believe that a person can never be punished unless that person has already been warned.
Rava thinks that it is impossible to warn plotting witnesses. If we warned them before they offer their testimony, they could just say that they forgot the warning. If we were to warn them while they are testifying, they would not testify at all, even if they had true things to say. And we cannot warn them at the end, because once their testimony has been given, it is too late to warn them.
These two amoraim point out that it would seem to be possible to warn plotting witnesses. First of all, we could warn them immediately after they testify. This would allow them to recant immediately.<br>Aha says we could warn them before they testify and then hint to them while they’re testifying that they were warned not to lie. We could hint gently enough to avoid discouraging them from testifying.
Abaye now changes his mind and agrees with Rava and R. Elazar that plotting witnesses do not require a warning to be lashed. Plotting witnesses, after all, attempt to kill the accused without warning him, therefore they deserve to be killed without being warned.<br>To return to the argument from the beginning of the page, since they cannot be warned, they are not lashed when they testify about monetary matters. However, if they falsely testify about something that would make the accused liable for a physical punishment, then they are punished with that physical punishment, in accordance with the verses, “then you shall do to him as he plotted to do to his brother.”
Samma raises another difficulty. We know that if someone falsely testifies that another person is the son of a divorcee or a halutzah, in essence saying that he is not a priest, the verse “you shall do to him as he thought to do to his fellow” does not apply. We don’t say that the witness is not a priest. Rather, he is lashed for his false testimony. But if this is the verse that exempts him from a warning, then we should require a warning for such a false witness before he could be lashed. So why do we not?<br>The answer comes from a verse that equates the law for everyone. Since some plotting witnesses do not require warning (for instance they falsely testified that someone was a murderer), no plotting witnesses require a warning.
Introduction<br>Today’s section deals with injurers, and the fact that they are fined and do not receive lashes.
Shisha offers a multi-staged proof that the injurer pays a fine and is not lashed. The proof comes from the verses about men fighting and striking a woman, who then miscarries. R. Elazar explains that the men are fighting with the intent to kill each other. If one does kill the man with whom he is fighting or the woman, then he is a murderer and he is executed. According to rabbinic law, he must have been warned before, because if he was not warned, he cannot be executed. Now, the warning that he receives about murder, counts as a warning for the lighter punishment of lashes which he would get for striking another person if death does not occur. Nevertheless, if death does not occur, the perpetrator is fined and not lashed. Thus we learn that even if he was warned and therefore he could theoretically be punished with lashes, he is fined and not lashed.

Daf 33b

Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section we learned that if a person is warned not to commit a more serious crime (punished by death) and then he commits a less serious crime (punished by lashes) then he can receive the less serious punishment. The warning for the more serious punishment was sufficient.
Ashi raises two difficulties. First of all, where do we even know the rule that if one is warned regarding a severe matter, the warning stands for the less severe matter? Second, how do we know that death is more severe than lashes. Rav seemed to hint that had they threatened Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah with lashes instead of throwing them into the furnace, they would have bowed down to the idol.
Rav’s statement concerning Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah does not prove that lashing is more stringent than death. The lashing that the Babylonian king would have meted out to them would have been without any limit, and therefore would have been more stringent than the lashes dished out by a court, for which there is a limit of 39.
There is a dispute in Sanhedrin concerning a person who means to kill one person and accidentally kills another. Is he a murderer? This is relevant to the case of the fighting men in Exodus 21. One man was intending to kill the other man and accidentally killed the woman. According to the rabbis, he is a murderer. Therefore, we have a case of a person warned for a severe matter who is considered warned for a light matter.<br>But Rabbi holds that such a person is not considered a murderer, and therefore the word “life for a life” does not mean “life” but money. The man would pay the value of the woman he accidentally killed to her inheritors. This would allow us to say that the entire case is one where he is not warned. If he was not warned about murder, he would pay the value of the woman he killed and if she was not killed, he would pay the value of the fetuses. But if he was warned, and he caused a miscarriage I could still say that he is lashed and does not pay the fine. So we have not proved yet that he pays the fine.
Jacob from Nehar Pekod derives the idea that personal injurers pay and are not lashed from a different set of verses. The Torah talks about a person who strikes another and the victim lives for a few days. The perpetrator is set aside to see if the one he injured will die. If he dies, he is executed, but if he does not die, he pays the cost of healing and loss of work (there are other payments too, but the rabbis derive them from other verses). Now, if there is the possibility that the criminal would be executed, it must mean that he was warned. This warning not to murder is sufficient for the more lenient matter of lashes. So theoretically, if the victim lives, the perpetrator could be lashed because he has been warned. But the Torah clearly says that he pays the loss of work and he pays for his healing; he is not lashed (one cannot receive two punishments). Thus we again have proof that one who injures another pays the fine and is not lashed, even if he was warned.
Introduction<br>The first part of this page is the exact same difficulty we saw above in section four. The end of the section is different.
Ashi raises two difficulties. First of all, where do we even know the rule that if one is warned regarding a severe matter, the warning stands for the less severe matter? Second, how do we know that death is more severe than lashes. Rav seemed to hint that had they threatened Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah with lashes instead of throwing them into the furnace, they would have bowed down to the idol.
Rav’s statement concerning Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah does not prove that lashing is more stringent than death. The lashing that the Babylonian king would have meted out to them would have been without any limit, and therefore would have been more stringent than the lashes dished out by a court, for which there is a limit of 39.
Jacob of Nehar Pekod’s proof was based on the assumption that the person struck the other intentionally, and therefore must have been warned about murder before. Perhaps it was unintentional, in which case there was no warning whatsoever. If so, then warning is just not relevant to these verses. If the victim dies, the one who struck him goes into exile. If he doesn’t die, the injurer pays the fine. But there could never be any lashes, because lashes are only if he does so intentionally.
Introduction<br>Today’s section goes all the way back to the contradiction between our mishnah in Ketubot (he pays the fine) and the mishnah in Makkot (he is lashed).
Up until now we have assumed that a person who is supposed to receive lashes and a fine is only fined or only lashed. But Resh Lakish resolves the two sources in a completely different way—he is both fined and lashed.
According to R. Meir a man who rapes/seduces his virgin sister is lashed and pays the fine, But the Mishnah that says that one who rapes/seduces his virgin daughter is not fined because he is executed and we know that this position is the opposite of R. Meir. R. Meir holds that not only can one be lashed and fined, he can even be executed and fined. This was taught with regard to various crimes of stealing and slaughtering an animal. When the thief slaughters the animal he is liable to pay the four or five fold payment. If he slaughtered it on Shabbat or for idolatrous purposes, he is liable for the death penalty. So this is a case where with one crime he is liable for two penalties—death and a fine. R. Meir says he gets both.<br>So, to return to our question, how can we identify the mishnah in Ketubot with R. Meir?<br>[Below we will clarify the issue of the ox that is to be stoned]
The Talmud now rejects the idea that R. Meir holds that one can receive the death penalty and be fined. R. Meir said that he pays the fine only if another person slaughtered the animal. If the thief himself slaughtered the animal, even R. Meir would agree that he is executed and does not pay the fine.
The Talmud asks—how can the thief be liable for the four or five fold payment if he was not the one who slaughtered the stolen animal? Rava answers by comparing selling with slaughtering. Just as selling inevitably involves another person, so too slaughtering can involve another person. This seems to make common sense. The thief is liable for having the animal slaughtered, not for necessarily slaughtering it himself.
Introduction<br>At the end of last week’s daf, we learned that if a person steals a sheep/ox or other animal and then someone else slaughter it on his behalf, the thief is liable for the four or five fold payment, even though he did not slaughter it himself. This week’s daf opens with a discussion of this issue.
These two “schools” find words in Exodus 21:37 that they read as including the agent—even if the thief does not slaughter the animal himself, he is still liable for the extra payment.
Mar Zutra raises a paradox on the above halakhah. If the thief himself stole the animal and then slaughtered it on Shabbat, he would be exempt from the extra payment (he receives the worse punishment, death). But if the thief had someone else slaughter the animal, he would be liable for the payment. So it turns out that the thief is more liable when someone else does the deed. This seems strange.
The reason that he does not pay is not because he is not liable. He is indeed, at least in principle, liable. He just cannot pay the penalty because he incurs the worse punishment, death.
In the baraita at the end of last week’s daf the rabbis ruled that the thief who steals an animal and then slaughters it on Shabbat is exempt from the four or five fold payment. The Talmud had claimed that the baraita referred to a case where someone else had slaughtered the animal. This helps explain why R. Meir says that the thief is liable for the financial—the thief did not transgress Shabbat. The problem is that we now do not understand why the sages believe him to be exempt! After all, he did not transgress Shabbat, so why should he be exempt from the fine too!<br>The answer is that this baraita follows R. Shimon according to whom a slaughtering that does not render the animal fit to be eaten does not count as slaughtering. Since this slaughtering took place on Shabbat, the assumption (for now) is that such an animal may not be eaten. Since we disregard the slaughtering, we exempt him from the death penalty and make him liable for the monetary penalty.

Daf 34a

The problem is that what we just said seems to be incorrect—slaughtering on Shabbat does render the animal “kosher.” This leaves us without an explanation for the rabbis who hold that if someone besides the thief slaughtered the animal on Shabbat, the thief is exempt from the four or five fold payment.
The Talmud now finds a tanna, R. Yohanan the Sandler, who holds that if someone intentionally slaughters an animal on Shabbat, it may never be eaten by anyone, neither the slaughterer nor someone else. This is learned out from a baraita about cooking on Shabbat. According to R. Yohanan food cooked intentionally on Shabbat may never be eaten. Thus if the agent slaughters on Shabbat, the thief is not liable because the slaughtering does not count as slaughtering because the animal cannot be eaten. Note that this is completely different than the original baraita in which the argument seemed to be over whether he can incur the death penalty and a financial penalty for the same crime.
Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section R. Yohanan the Sandler said that an animal slaughtered intentionally on Shabbat may never be eaten. Today’s section explains the source of his opinion.
Hiyya derives R. Yohanan’s halakhah from the verse in Exodus—just as one may not eat holy food (unless he is a priest), so too one may not eat food prepared (cooked or slaughtered) on the holy Shabbat.
Hiyya goes on to say that food prepared on Shabbat is not exactly like holy food. One may not derive any benefit whatsoever from holy food. But one may derive benefit from food prepared on Shabbat. It is only prohibited to eat such food, not derive benefit from it.
Yohanan the Sandler said that the food was prohibited only if he cooked it intentionally on Shabbat. If he cooked the food on Shabbat by mistake (he didn’t know that it was Shabbat, or he didn’t know that it was prohibited to cook on Shabbat) the food may be eaten, by others, after Shabbat. This is derived from the mention of the death penalty in the continuation of the verse. The death penalty is only for those who willfully violate Shabbat. So too the absolute prohibition of the food is only for those who intentionally desecrate Shabbat.
Introduction<br>Above we learned that according to R. Yohanan the Sandler food prepared intentionally on Shabbat is prohibited even after Shabbat. Today’s section continues with discussion of this issue.
These two amoraim dispute whether food prepared on Shabbat is prohibited by the Torah or only by the rabbis. Above, in yesterday’s section, we saw the midrash of those who hold that food prepared on Shabbat is “holy” and just as “holy” food may not be eaten, so too food prepared on Shabbat may not be eaten. The other opinion, that holds that food prepared on Shabbat is prohibited only by the rabbis, reads the words “it is holy” to mean that only Shabbat (“it”) is holy, not the food prepared on Shabbat.
We now return to the baraita about a thief who slaughters the stolen animal on Shabbat. The rabbis had said that he was exempt from paying. But if the prohibition of eating food prepared on Shabbat is only rabbinic, then why should he be exempt from paying the fine, when someone else slaughtered it. [I realize this is a complicated set of assumptions about the case in that baraita]. In other words the agent slaughtered the animal, in which case the original thief should be liable to pay the fine, because the thief did not transgress Shabbat. This is true since the slaughtering is valid, at least by Torah law.<br>The resolution is that the rabbis exempted him in the other cases—either one who slaughtered an ox for idolatry or one who slaughtered an ox that was to be stoned. In these cases since he is liable for the death penalty he is not fined. But if the agent slaughtered the ox on Shabbat, the thief must pay the fine, even according to the rabbis.
The Talmud now discusses the other cases in that baraita. The first is one who slaughters an animal for idol worship. Remember, this is an animal that was stolen. According to Rabbi Meir he pays the four or five fold payment, even if he slaughters it for idolatry. The problem is that as soon as he begins to slaughter it for idolatrous purposes, the animal immediately becomes prohibited, and it is not considered to belong to the owner. And then when he completes the slaughtering, it is not the original owner’s ox that he is slaughtering, so why should he be liable to pay back the four or five fold payment!<br>Rava answers that the person says that he is worshiping only at the very completion of the slaughtering. This way the slaughtering is completed at the exact same moment in which he also transgresses the laws of idol worship.
The Talmud now turns its attention to the other case—a person slaughters an ox condemned to die because it had killed a person. How then can he be liable to pay the owner when this is no longer technically his ox since it had been condemned to death?<br>Rabbah explains the scenario—the original owner gave it to a guardian, and then the ox killed a person and was sentenced to death while still in possession of the guardian. The thief stole it from the guardian’s house. The Talmud will now explain why this is relevant.
Meir holds that if the guardian returned it after it had been condemned to death, it counts as returned, even though the owner will not be able to do anything with the animal. In addition he holds that an action that causes loss or gain of money counts as money. Together what this means is that when the thief stole it from the guardian’s home he caused a loss of money to the guardian even though it was prohibited for anyone to derive benefit from the ox. Had the ox been alive, the guardian could have returned it to the original owner. Now that it is dead, the guardian will have to pay for the loss of the ox. When the thief stole it he was therefore causing the guardian a loss. Therefore, he owes the guardian money, according to R. Meir.

Daf 34b

Introduction<br>In our section, Rabbah goes back a few steps and explains why R. Meir would say that the thief is obligated to pay for the ox even though he is also obligated for the death penalty. Instead of saying that an agent slaughtered it, as was said at the end of daf 33, Rabbah now says that the thief slaughtered it himself.
The answer is that generally speaking R. Meir holds that one can receive lashes and be fined (for instance, in the case of raping or seducing one’s virgin sister) but generally does not receive the death penalty and a financial penalty for the same crime. However, these three cases (the thief who slaughters the stolen ox on Shabbat, or for idol worship, or an ox condemned to be stoned) are different because they are a “kenas”—or a fine. The laws of fines are considered “innovative” because they go beyond compensation. Therefore, according to Rabbah, one can get both the death penalty and a fine.
Rabbah here is following his own reasoning, that one can pay a kenas and still be liable for the death penalty. If he steals a kid before Shabbat and then slaughters it on Shabbat, he is liable for the four fold penalty because he became liable for the theft before Shabbat, and then he became liable for the kenas (the four fold payment) on Shabbat. Rabbah holds that one can pay a kenas and be liable for the death penalty at the same time. However, if he steals the animal on Shabbat and slaughters it on Shabbat, he does not pay anything, because his liability for stealing (evidently carrying the animal), which is penalized by a compensatory payment (paying the principle of what he stole) comes at the same time as he transgresses Shabbat. This is not a kenas a fine—it is simply paying back that which he stole. Since he does not have to pay the first payment because he is liable for the death penalty, he does not pay the extra fines either because without stealing he could not be obligated for slaughtering or selling it.
Rabbah now refers to a different situation, but one that has a similar formula as the above. When a thief is tunneling into a house, the rabbis consider him as if he is liable for the death penalty because if the owner of the house finds him, he may kill him. So if the thief steals a kid and then breaks into a house and slaughters the kid while he is in the act of breaking into the house, he must pay the fine. This is because he is first liable for stealing and only then liable for the death penalty.<br>But if he steals and slaughters the animal all while breaking into the house, he is exempt from the fine, because one cannot be liable to pay back the principle (the original value of the kid) and be liable for the death penalty at the exact same moment.
Rabbah has now stated two very similar laws—one concerning the thief who slaughtered on Shabbat and the other concerning a thief who slaughtered while in the act of breaking into a house. The Talmud, as it often does, discusses why we need both laws.<br>If Rabbah had only taught the first law, I might have said that in the case of breaking in, he does pay the fine, because his liability for the death penalty is only temporary. It only exists while he is in the act of breaking in. However, in the case of Shabbat, he is liable for the death penalty forever. Therefore, Rabbah needed to teach the case of the one who slaughters while breaking in.
In the case of breaking in, the thief may be executed even without a warning from witnesses, a general prerequisite before any criminal is executed. Therefore, I might have said that he is exempt from payment in that case, because he is executed without warning. But in the case of Shabbat, a person may not be executed without first being warned. Since we can assume he was not warned, we might have thought that he would have to pay. After all, in the end they are not going to execute him. Rabbah therefore teaches us that even though he will not be executed, since he is theoretically liable for execution, he is exempt from payment.
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues to deal with cases where one slaughtered an animal on Shabbat. When is he liable to pay the fine, and when is he not?
The first half of R. Papa’s law is similar to Rava’s rulings in the previous section. Since he is first liable for being a thief and then liable for transgressing Shabbat, he is not exempt from payment.<br>However, if he borrowed a cow and slaughtered it on Shabbat, he is exempt from the fine. This is because the liability for slaughtering a cow that did not belong to him came at the same moment as the liability for transgressing Shabbat.
Aha is perplexed—why does R. Papa need to state this rule with regard to a cow? Don’t we already know both halves of this rule?<br>Ashi answers him, that if it were not for R. Papa we might have thought that as soon as he takes possession of the cow he becomes completely responsible for it, as if it were his own. This would imply that when he later slaughters the ox, he is slaughtering an ox that already belonged to him and that the liability for the money would be at the time of possession, earlier than the liability for Shabbat. Therefore, R. Papa teaches us that the ox is not totally his from the time he borrows it. He is only liable for the accident at the moment it happens. Therefore, the liability to pay back the value of the ox comes at the same time that the liability for slaughtering the ox comes. He is liable for death and not the financial penalty.
If orphans take possession of their father’s borrowed cow, they may use the cow and if it dies, they are not responsible because they were not the borrowers.<br>If they thought that they owned it through their inheritance and they slaughtered it, they are only responsible for paying back the value of the meat at the lowest price. This is the minimum amount that they benefited. In other words, they really are not responsible to pay back the cow, they merely don’t get to benefit from it. Therefore they have to pay the amount that they may have paid for food in any case. Rashi adds that they also the hide back to the owners.
Rava’s statement goes on to teach that if the father left land to repay the borrowed cow, the inheritors must pay back the full value of the cow. The question is which part of Rava’s statement does this refer to?<br>Some say it refers to the first case, where the animal died on its own. If they have to pay back even if the animal dies, then all the more so they have to pay back if they slaughter it themselves. This means that the father assumed responsibility over anything that happens from the time he borrowed the animal. This disagrees with R. Papa who said that this liability happened only when the animal died, and in this case since they didn’t borrow it, they wouldn’t be liable.<br>But the one who teaches it in reference to the last clause, where they slaughtered it, would hold that it does not refer to the case where the animal died on its own. This position would agree with R. Papa that they do not become liable for anything that might happen to the ox from the time they borrow it.
Introduction<br>This section refers to the two different ways to solve the contradiction between the Mishnah in Ketubot and the Mishnah in Makkot. According to R. Yohanan, Ketubot exempts the one who rapes/seduces his virgin sister from lashes because the witnesses did not warn him before he committed his crime; Makkot obligates him for lashes (and exempts him from the fine) because they did warn him. Resh Lakish said that the Mishnah in Ketubot follows R. Meir who holds that one can receive lashes and pay the fine.<br>As is typical in the Talmud, the question is why each amora does not hold by the other amora’s solution.
Yohanan does not agree with Resh Lakish because R. Yohanan’s explanation allows the mishnah to follow the majority opinion of the rabbis, and not the minority opinion of R. Meir. But why doesn’t Resh Lakish accept R. Yohanan’s resolution that our mishnah refers to a case where they did not warn him, and therefore he cannot be lashed?
According to Resh Lakish, since the person would be exempt from paying the fine if he had been warned (he would be lashed), he is also exempt if he was not warned. In other words, according to Resh Lakish the ability to actually lash the perpetrator is immaterial. All that matters is the nature of the crime. If one commits a crime for which he could be penalized with lashes and a financial penalty, he is lashed and does not pay the fine, even if in the end he cannot really be lashed. That is why he has to assign the mishnah to R. Meir who holds that one can be fined and lashed for the same crime.
This section states basically the same as above, but in a more principled manner. According to R. Yohanan if one commits a crime inadvertently that would carry with it the death penalty (or lashes or something else) had it been done intentionally, he is liable for the fine. Since they didn’t warn him, and therefore we have to assume that it was an unwitting sin, he is liable for the fine.<br>Resh Lakish says that since the crime carries with it the death penalty (or lashes or something else) he can never pay the fine, even if they did not warn him.
Resh Lakish raises a difficulty against R. Yohanan. The verse in the Torah that is the source of the notion that one cannot get two penalties for the same crime is from Exodus 21. The Torah says that if no harm, meaning death, comes to the woman, the husband must pay for the miscarried fetuses. To Resh Lakish this implies that if the woman does die, the husband does not pay for the fetuses, even if the husband cannot be executed because he was not warned.<br>Yohanan rejects this and reads the verse to imply that if the law concerning “harm” meaning death to the woman is not relevant, then the husband pays the fine. The husband is liable even if he cannot be executed because he was not warned.

Daf 35a

This section is just a reverse of the previous section.
Introduction<br>Earlier we saw an opinion that if one committed two crimes simultaneously, for one he is liable for death/lashes and for the other a fine, then he is exempt from the fine because he would receive the more serious penalty. But there was a debate if he is liable for the fine if he cannot receives lashes/death because he committed that transgression unintentionally. For instance, if he burned down a house on Shabbat but did not know that this was forbidden on Shabbat, or he did not know that it was Shabbat, some hold that he pays the fine because he cannot be punished for transgressing Shabbat, and some hold that he is not liable for the fine.
As we will see, Rava holds that everyone agrees that if one commits a sin for which he would be liable for death if done intentionally and is also liable to pay a fine, he does not pay the fine. Paradoxically, the person who damages property and commits a religious crime at the same time pays nothing, whereas the person who just damages property would pay.
The house of Hezekiah (his study house) bases this midrash on Exodus 24:21—“One who kills an animal must pay, and one who kills a person must die.” Hezekiah reads these as absolute. In the case of killing an animal, the one who does so must always pay, no matter if he does this intentionally or not, and no matter how he does it. The same is true if one kills. It does not matter whether he does so intentionally or not, he never pays compensation.<br>I should note that on a simple sense, there is nothing absurd about this. It teaches that property is always an issue of financial compensation. One never executes a person for destroying property. And the opposite is also true, one never pays for the taking of a life. Life and property cannot be equated. As a value statement, this makes perfect sense. The problem is when we understand it not as a value statement, but a legal one. If one accidentally murders, say in a car accident, then it would seem to make common sense that he should pay the damages. Otherwise you arrive at the absurdity that if one accidentally runs over another car and kills another person, he is not punished at all, whereas if no one died, he would pay the fine. As I’ve said before, this is an absurdity, one example of why the Jewish penal code could not actually be used in practice.
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues to deal with the issue of whether one is liable to pay a fine when one has unintentionally committed a crime for which he would be liable for death or lashes.
Ravin says that all indeed do agree that if one commits a crime inadvertently for which he would have been liable for death had he committed it willfully, he does not pay the fine. They argue if the two punishments would have been lashes and a fine—according to R. Yohanan he pays the fine, since in the end he is not lashed. The verse cited by the house of Hezekiah referred only to death and a fine—when the punishment is death, he is never fined. But there was no such comparison for lashes. Therefore, if he cannot be lashed because the sin was unintentional, he is fined.
Resh Lakish holds that the same is true with one who commits a crime punishable by lashes—even if inadvertent and therefore he cannot be lashed, he does not pay the fine. This is because the Torah explicitly equates the two—those who are liable for lashes and those who are liable for death.
The amoraim now search for where the Torah compares one who commits a sin punishable by death with one who commits a sin punishable by lashes. According to Abaye, the comparison is made when the Torah calls both wicked—Numbers refers to one liable for death and Deuteronomy refers to one liable for lashes. Thus the same rules apply to both.<br>Rava derives it from “one who strikes.” Tomorrow’s section discusses which word this refers to. In other words, where does the Torah use this word in reference in reference to lashes. We know where it uses it in connection with the death penalty—Leviticus 24:21. Stay tuned!
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues yesterday’s. Here we look for where the Torah might have used the word “strikes” in connection with lashes such that we could say that death and lashes have the same rule—if one inadvertently commits a crime for which he would be liable for lashes had he done it intentionally, he does not pay the fine.
Papa is looking for a verse in which the word “strike” means to hit someone without killing them such that the perpetrator would be liable for lashes and not the death penalty. But Leviticus 24:21 refers to one who kills and therefore this is not the correct “strike.”
The next suggestion is that the use of the word striking to mean hitting but not killing comes from Leviticus 24:18-19. Here the word “striking” is used in reference to the animal but the problem is that this word is not used in reference to striking a person. Nevertheless, the Talmud finds this sufficient because the words mean the same thing. Thus, we are led to think that just as one who inadvertently commits a crime for which he would be liable for death had he done it intentionally is exempt from paying a fine, so too is one who inadvertently commits a crime for which he is liable for lashes.
The problem is that the verse from Leviticus refers to one who injures another person, and in reality such a person is not lashed, as we have learned. He pays the person he has injured, and is not lashed.
There is a case in which a person would be lashed for striking another person—if the damages he causes are not worth a perutah. Less than a perutah is not considered to have any value. Therefore, since he does not owe money to the person he struck, he is lashed. So now we have a case where the word “striking” results in lashes.

Daf 35b

The problem is that we can still think about the person who struck another person as liable for payment. We could still say that in general a person who inadvertently commits a sin for which he is liable for lashes and money does pay money since he cannot be lashed. In other words, he is exempt from paying because he didn’t really damage the person, not because he could theoretically be lashed.<br>The answer is that the verse could refer to a case where a person struck another person and damaged his property at the same time. If he was not warned then he cannot be lashed for striking another person. And since he is theoretically liable for lashes, he  also does not pay the fine.<br>So to summarize—if one strikes another and causes no property damage, he pays compensation for bodily damage. If one strikes another and causes property damage but no bodily damage, he will pay nothing. If he was warned beforehand he will be lashed, and if he was not warned beforehand, nothing will happen to him. Again, we see the impracticality of Jewish law.
Introduction<br>Today’s section deals with the statement of the House of Hezekiah from earlier on this page (section one). To aid I am quoting the English in its entirety:<br>“He that kills a man . . . he that kills a beast:” Just as in [the case of] the killing of a beast you have made no distinction between [it being done] inadvertently and willfully, intentionally and unintentionally, by way of going down or by way of going up, so as to free exempt him [from the payment], but [to in any case] make him liable to pay, so also in [the case of] the killing of a person you shall make no distinction between [it being done] inadvertently and willfully, intentionally and unintentionally, by way of going down or by way of going up, so as to make him liable to pay money, but to free him from paying money?
The House of Hezekiah stated that when it comes to killing the animal, the Torah made no distinction—one who does so pays, whether he has been warned or not. But R. Hiyya points out that this is not necessarily true. If one kills an animal on Shabbat he does not pay the fine because he has transgressed Shabbat. If so, we could not state categorically that one who kills an animal pays a fine, and then we could not state categorically that one who kills a person does not pay a fine.
Rava (or the Talmud) now explains why the verse must refer to a week day and not Shabbat. The verse says that if he killed a man, he must be put to death. This means that he was warned, for if he was not warned he could not be put to death. So if he was also warned not to kill an animal on Shabbat because if he did he would be liable for death, then he would be executed and not pay the fine. Therefore, the verse which says that he does pay the fine, must refer to the week day. On the week day, he will always pay a fine for killing an animal and never pay a fine for killing a man.
Introduction<br>Today’s section refers back to a statement made by Rabbah on page 34b. The following is the quote:<br>Rabbah said: Indeed [it speaks of a case] when he slaughtered it himself and R. Meir holds the view that [though generally] one may receive the lashes and pay, one cannot receive the death penalty and pay but these [cases]  are different, because the Torah has enacted something novel with regard to a fine, and [therefore]  he has to pay, although he has to suffer the death penalty.<br>According to Rabbah since the case of fine is a “novelty” one can, under certain circumstances, pay and suffer the death penalty. The specific case referred to here was a thief who stole an animal and slaughtered it on Shabbat. He is liable for the death penalty slaughtering on Shabbat, and he pays the four or five fold fine. Our sugya discusses this claim.
According to the Mishnah if one rapes his virgin daughter, he is executed and does not pay the fine, because daughter incest is punishable by death. This does not accord with R. Meir, who holds that one can suffer the death penalty and pay a fine. According to the Mishnah, if he rapes his virgin sister, he can be lashed and pay a fine. This does not accord with R. Nehuniah ben Hakaneh who holds that one cannot be lashed and pay a fine for the same crime. Finally, our mishnah says that he is liable for karet for raping his sister. According to the mishnah in Makkot, the court lashes one who is liable for karet. But R. Isaac disagrees with this principle—one liable for karet is not lashed. According to R. Isaac one who rapes his sister is not lashed at all, therefore he pays the fine. But all agree that one who rapes a mamzeret is lashed. So our mishnah that holds that he pays a fine would not accord with R. Isaac.
Rabbah could solve the problem by following R. Yohanan who says that our mishnah according to which he pays a fine even though he is liable for karet, refers to a case where he was not warned and therefore cannot be lashed. This would allow the Mishnah to work with R. Nehuniah ben Hakaneh. But Resh Lakish did not hold like R. Yohanan. So if Rabbah holds like Resh Lakish, then how could Rabbah then understand the mishnah.<br>The answer is quite simple—Rabbah holds like R. Yohanan.
According to Resh Lakish one who deserves lashes does not pay the fine, even if he cannot actually be lashed. So then who is the tanna of our Mishnah in Ketubot that does hold that he is lashed and pays the fine? The answer is that it is either R. Meir or R. Isaac. R. Meir would simply hold that he indeed is lashed and pays a fine. R. Isaac would say that according to our Mishnah he receives karet, but he is not fined. Therefore he is lashed.
Introduction<br>Today’s sugya opens with a new baraita (yes, this section for the first time in a very, very long time, is not directly connected with the previous one).<br>The baraita refers to two topics that really the same. The first is the fine paid for rape and the second is the payment for seduction, both of a virgin. These are the payments outlined in Deuteronomy 22:28-29 (rape) and Exodus 22:15-16 (seduction). The rabbis generally equate these two laws such as that they apply equally.<br>Furthermore, I should again emphasize that by the rabbinic period these issues were no longer practiced. As is often the case, the rabbinic discussion is more connected to theory of law than practical law.<br>The baraita lists women who may not claim these payments.
Below the Talmud will explain what “forbidden relations” are. Relations forbidden in the second degree are secondary incest prohibitions. This will also be explained below.<br>An aylonit is someone who is clearly female, but never develops signs of reaching sexual maturity. By definition she cannot give birth.<br>A “woman who has gone out on account of an evil name” seems to refer to a woman whose husband accused her of not being a virgin at the time of her marriage. This too will be discussed below.
If “forbidden relations” refers to biblical incest prohibitions, then “relations forbidden in the second degree” would assumedly refer to those relationships prohibited by the rabbis. This would include grandmother and other such distant relations. The problem is that if the relationship is only prohibited by rabbinic law, then why shouldn’t she receive the fine, which is mandated by biblical law. This is understandable when it comes to the biblical prohibitions, but not with regard to the secondary category.

Daf 36a

The Talmud now interprets both phrases in the baraita as referring to relations prohibited by the Torah. The first category refers to those punishable by death (such as daughter or mother), the second to those punishable by karet (such as sister). In these cases, the perpetrator does not pay the fine because he receives the worse punishment.<br>But if the woman was simply prohibited by a negative commandment (such as a mamzeret), she is eligible for the fine. According to Shimon the Yemenite (statement found at the beginning of this chapter) as long as the marriage is possible, he is liable for the fines. Since marriage with a woman prohibited by the punishments of death or karet is not possible, there is no fine. But marriage with a woman prohibited by a negative commandment is possible, therefore he does pay the fine.
According to this understanding of the Mishnah, even for women prohibited only by a negative commandment (no karet, no death penalty) there is no fine. This accords with R. Shimon ben Menassia who said earlier in the chapter that if the marriage is even prohibited, there is no fine. Even if the marriage is viable. Thus a mamzeret would not get the fine.
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues to explain the baraita that was at the end of last week’s daf, concerning certain categories of women who do not receive the fine for being raped or seduced.<br>There is one term that is helpful to know for this section—na’arah. A na’arah is a girl between the age of being a minor and being an adult. Sometimes this is defined by absolute age—from 12 to 12 ½, and sometimes it is defined by physical development, a na’arah being a girl who has begun to reach puberty but has not completed it.
A woman who refuses her husband refers to the situation where a young girl was married off by her mother or brother. Such a marriage has a lesser legal status than if she were married off by her father. Therefore, when she is older she has a right to refuse the marriage. Such a woman does not receive the fine because she has, to a certain extent, already been married, even if that marriage was annulled. As a reminder, these fines are only for virgins, women who have never been married.<br>The implication is that an ordinary minor does receive the fine. This accords with the opinion of the rabbis, as we shall see below.
According to the second clause of last week’s baraita, the aylonit, a woman who never shows signs of puberty, also does not receive a fine. This seems to accord with R. Meir, who holds that since she goes straight from being a minor to being an adult (at the age of 20) she has no period of being a na’arah, a young girl, the category referred to in the Torah.<br>The problem is that the first clause (the woman who refused marriage) accords with the sages, who hold that an ordinary minor does receive a fine, and the second seems to accord with R. Meir, who holds that an aylonit does not receive a fine.
The first attempt at solving the baraita would involve positing that R. Meir would agree with R. Judah that even a na’arah, a girl from the age of puberty through the next six months, could refuse marriage. This would mean that a na’arah who refuses marriage does not receive the fine, but a regular na’arah does receive a fine, and now the Mishnah could accord with R. Meir who agrees on this point. We would not need to deduce, as we did  above, that a regular minor receives a fine.<br>The problem is that R. Meir explicitly disagrees with R. Judah. R. Meir holds that a girl has the right to refuse marriage until she hits puberty, that is to say as long as she is a minor. R. Judah holds that she can refuse until she is well into puberty, that is to say, even while she is a na’arah.
The next possibility would be to identify the mishnah as being that of R. Judah. He would say that a girl who refuses marriage as a na’arah does not receive the fine, but a regular na’arah does. A minor would not receive a fine. He would agree with R. Meir that an aylonit does not receive a fine because she is not a na’arah.
Much later in this chapter, Rav will identify this mishnah with R. Meir. By saying the mishnah is Rabbi Meir he is tacitly admitting that the mishnah agrees only with R. Meir and not with R. Judah. So we cannot say that R. Judah agrees with R. Judah. Rather, R. Judah holds that a minor does receive a fine.
The final answer is that the mishnah agrees with R. Meir that a minor does not receive a fine, only a na’arah does. This explains why the aylonit does not receive a fine—she is never a na’arah. But the mishnah disagrees with R. Meir and holds that a girl can refuse marriage even when she is a na’arah. This means that when the mishnah says that a girl who refused marriage does not receive a fine, it refers to a na’arah. We can then deduce that a regular na’arah does receive a fine, but a minor does not.
Rafram offers a different solution. The mishnah does not refer to a girl who actually refused marriage. It actually refers to a girl who is of the age at which she could refuse marriage, that is to say a minor. The whole mishnah would now accord with R. Meir—a minor does not receive a fine.<br>The problem is that if the mishnah wanted to teach this, it should have just said, “a minor does not receive a fine.” Why refer to the minor in such a strange way.<br>The Talmud does not solve this problem.
Introduction<br>Today’s mishnah discusses the clause in the baraita about the aylonit, the female who never reaches sexual maturity.
According to our mishnah, an aylonit (a woman who never shows signs of sexual maturity) still receives the fine for rape or seduction. But there is a baraita that says the opposite.<br>The baraita also talks about virginity claims, a topic you may remember from chapter one. According to this baraita, a woman who is an aylonit can make a claim to the fine for rape.
The simple solution is that these two baraitot follow different rabbis, as we learned yesterday. R. Meir holds that only a “na’arah” has a claim to the fine, and since an aylonit is never a na’arah (she goes directly from being a minor to being of majority age), she never receives the fine. The rabbis hold that even a minor has a claim on the fine, and therefore an aylonit can also claim the fine.
The Talmud now transitions to a better difficulty on the earlier baraita. According to that baraita a husband can make a virginity claim again a deaf-mute wife or one lacking sound senses. But according to this baraita, a virginity claim cannot be made against these women.
R. Sheshet solves these two problems by ascribing each position to a different tanna, of the two tannaim who argued in chapter one, mishnah six. According to Rabban Gamaliel if a man claims that his wife was not a virgin she can defend herself by saying that she was raped after betrothal. (For more information see Ketubot 1:6).<br>This would mean that a husband basically cannot make a virginity claim against his wife because she will always have such a defense readily available. This equates, according to R. Sheshet, with the baraita that does not allow a husband of a deaf-mute or a woman not of sound senses to make a virginity claim. R. Joshua says that she cannot make such a defense, so he is the author of the baraita that allows such a husband to make a virginity claim against his wife.
The problem is that Rabban Gamaliel said that a woman was believed to make this specific claim. He did not seem to say that if a woman cannot make such a claim, we offer the claim on her behalf.<br>But in the end, that is what the Talmud says. If the woman cannot make a claim on her own behalf because she is a deaf-mute or lacking sound senses, her husband cannot make a virginity claim against her. She is given this defense, the Rabban Gamaliel defense, automatically. 
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues to go over line by line the baraita that appeared in yesterday’s section.
The baraita said that a husband cannot make a virginity claim against a woman who reaches the age of maturity. What this really means is that the rabbis did not believe that a girl who reached maturity age was a virgin anymore. While I do not know why they believed this, I would venture the guess that they may have believed that since she started to menstruate, her virginity blood is gone, perhaps washed away. The other interesting thing to note is that if most girls were not married until they were of age (this we know to be true) then virginity claims would not have been applicable to most women.<br>The difficulty is that Rav made another statement that seems to contradict this. Rav is dealing with the first night after a wedding, and with the problem of distinguishing between menstrual blood and virginal blood. It is forbidden for the couple to have sex if she is menstruating, but if the blood is virginal, they are permitted. Rav says that if the girl had reached the age of maturity, they can have sex the whole night without concern that the blood is menstrual. Clearly he believes that mature girls have virginal blood, so why, then, does the baraita say that there is no virginity claim against them.

Daf 36b

The answer is that a husband can claim that his wife was not a virgin because she did not bleed. As we saw from Rav, we can anticipate that mature women do have virginal blood. But he cannot make the claim that she is “an open door” a type of virginity claim referred to on pages 9-10 of this tractate.<br>I should note that this resolution is very difficult and contradicts other passages in the Talmud where we can see that the rabbis believed that mature girls did not have virginal blood. Furthermore, there are different versions of the line in manuscripts and medieval commentaries.
Summachus says that blind women cannot have virginity claims brought against them. The Talmud explains that blind women may have lost their virginal blood by some strenuous act (today this could be something like horse-back riding). If this occurs to a seeing girl, she will show her mother and the girl will know what happened. The problem, according to Summachus, is that the blind girl cannot see what happened to her, so she would not know that she is not a virgin.
The baraita that we learned in last week’s daf said that a woman who goes out because of an evil name, i.e. an adulteress, receives no fine or payment for being seduced. The problem is that a woman who commits adultery is liable to be stoned for adultery. Of course she doesn’t receive the fine.<br>Sheshet resolves the problem by claiming that the baraita refers to a woman who had an evil name go out about before she was married, while she was still young. Such a woman does not receive the fine for rape or seduction, because she is assumed not to be a virgin. Since the fine applies only to a virgin, she does not receive it.<br>[To reiterate, the fact that only a virgin receives the fine does not mean that rabbis sanctioned rape as long as the woman was not a virgin. The “fine” is a descendant of the biblical bride price paid to the father, which was only applicable to the virgin].
Papa derives from this that an unsound debt document cannot be used to collect a debt. The Talmud will explore the connection between this law and the law above about a girl who had a bad name go out about her.<br>The comparison would be that in both cases a rumor goes out that something is not as it claims to be. The document claims to be valid, but there is rumor that it was forged. The woman claims to be a virgin but there is a rumor that she is not.<br>The problem is that Rava said such rumors are ignored.
Since rumors aren’t trusted, the Talmud reinterprets the “evil name” about the document or the woman. In both cases two people come and claim that the woman or the person asked them to do something that caused suspicions to be raised. This would seem to be sufficient evidence to call into question either her virginity or the document’s accuracy.
The problem is that the two situations are not really comparable. With regard to the woman, we can assume that some men would have fornicated with her (this seems like a sound assumption to me). But with regard to forging a document, how can we be so sure that he eventually found someone to forge the document. Most people will not forge documents.<br>The answer is that even if he couldn’t find someone else to do it, since we know that he was trying to forge the document, we can assume that in the end, even if he couldn’t find anyone else to do it, he would have forged it himself. This makes perfect sense—would you trust a document that you know someone was trying to have forged?<br>One interesting side note about this section is how R. Papa tries to take an issue that was only of theoretical importance by the amoraic period (virginity claims) and analogize it to an issue that was of practical importance in his time, the forging of documents.
Introduction<br>Today’s section is the second mishnah of the chapter. It teaches those cases opposite of those mentioned in yesterday’s mishnah.<br>I should note that the opposite of many of these cases is found in the first mishnah of the chapter, which we learned way back on the beginning of Daf 29.
<b>Section one:</b>  In these cases the women are assumed to be non-virgins, and hence do not receive the fine.<br>Rabbi Judah rules that any captive who is redeemed is assumed not to have been raped and is therefore a virgin.<br><b>Section two:</b>  Having intercourse with these women is a capital crime.  Since the man is liable for the death penalty, he does not pay the fine, for there is a principle that one cannot be executed and pay a fine.  This is learned exegetically from the words in Exodus 21:22.  The case under discussion is when a man strikes a woman causing her to miscarry.  The Torah states that if there is no other “damage”, then he must pay the fine.  The interpretation is that if the woman herself doesn’t die, then the striker pays a fine for having caused her to miscarry.  Had she died, the striker would have been a murderer and would not have paid the fine.  Note that this is true even if the damages were caused accidentally.  Although one cannot be executed for an accidental murder, the rule of the Mishnah is that anytime a person commits a crime which is punishable by death had it been committed with intention, he is exempt from the fine.<br>A note about the Mishnah and Talmud’s references to sexual intercourse with young girls:<br>The rabbis occasionally reference sexual relations with young girls, even under the age of three.  I expect that this will cause discomfort to people reading the mishnah, and when I think of my own three year old daughter, this makes me queasy as well. We would do well to realize that the Mishnah’s discussion of all legal possibilities does not imply their tacit approval of them.  The Mishnah discusses many crimes without expressing horror over them, because the Mishnah is often interested in legal consequences. The rabbis certainly did not condone sexual relations with girls this young.
Introduction<br>Today’s section begins to deal with the mishnah, particularly R. Judah’s statement that we do not suspect that a captive woman has been raped.
R. Judah in the Mishnah said that if a woman is taken captive, we can assume that she was not raped. R. Yohanan will now try to equate that opinion with that of R. Dosa found elsewhere.
According to R. Dosa, we do not assume that female captives were raped. At worst, they may be touched by their captors. [I apologize for the graphic language. I didn’t write it, but still].
Rava tries to now say that it might be that R. Judah and R. Dosa might not agree. This is a difficulty on R. Yohanan.<br>Judah might have said that a female captive is assumed not to have been raped only so that she could be considered a virgin and her rapist/seducer would have to pay the fine. But vis a vis other issues (such as staying married to her priestly husband) he might agree that we need to be concerned that she was raped.
It is also possible that R. Dosa said that we can assume she was not raped only with regard to eating terumah, which after the destruction of the Temple is only of rabbinic status. But when it comes to the rapist or seducer paying the fine, which is of Toraitic status, we would not make him liable to pay the fine unless we could be 100 per cent sure that she was a virgin. Again, R. Dosa may not have made a blanket statement with regard to the captive woman.
Abaye critiques Rava’s proposal that R. Judah may hold that a female captive is assumed to remain a virgin only to force subsequent rapist to pay the fine (“that the sinner should gain no advantage”). The problem is that R. Judah assumes that she is a virgin with regard to the size of the ketubah she would receive when she gets married later in life. According to R. Judah, she receives a ketubah of 200 zuz, the ketubah of a virgin. The one who marries her is certainly not sinning, so why should he have to give her 200 zuz, as if we could be certain that she was a virgin? The answer seems to be that R. Judah really believes that she was not raped.
The Talmud now rejects Abaye’s difficulty on Rava, and posits a totally separate reason why R. Judah would say that when it comes to getting married, she is presumed a virgin. If she received a ketubah of 100, we would have to fear that men would refrain from marrying her, the idea being that men back then (and I’m still sure it’s true in places now) prefer to marry virgins.<br>To summarize: R. Judah might not make a blanket assumption that captive women were not raped. He could say that it depends on what the ramifications of such an assumption would be. When it comes to the fine, he would say that a man who rapes a woman who had been taken captive must pay the fine, so that he should not be rewarded. A woman who had been taken would still receive a ketubah of 200, to encourage men to marry her. But a woman who had been taken captive would not be allowed to stay married to her husband the priest.
Introduction<br>In the mishnah R. Judah holds that a woman who was taken captive should not be assumed to have been raped. This section questions whether that is what R. Judah really holds.
In this baraita, the issue is whether one who is involved in redeeming a captive woman may marry her (assuming he is a priest, who may not marry her if she was raped). The Talmud will explain the baraita as we proceed, but for now it is sufficient to note that according to R. Judah, in either case he may not marry her. Clearly, however we interpret this baraita, R. Judah says that there is an assumption that she was raped.
The Talmud explains what it believes the baraita really means. If a man redeems a woman and testifies that she has not been raped, he himself is allowed to marry her, even if he is a priest. We can assume that he redeemed her in order to marry her [I know this might be distasteful]. But if he merely testifies on her behalf, he can’t marry her, because we are concerned that he is lying in order to allow her to marry him. Generally, people who give testimony cannot benefit from that testimony.
Papa resolves the contradiction between R. Judah in the baraita and R. Judah in the Mishnah by emending the baraita. R. Judah says that in either case he is allowed to marry her, in line with his opinion in the Mishnah that a female captive is not assumed to have been raped.
Huna’s resolution is slightly different from R. Papa’s. He maintains the reading of the baraita, but says that R. Judah was not stating his own opinion.<br>Rather, R. Judah was arguing against the opinion of the rabbis. He says that if you’re going to fear that someone would testify on behalf of the woman just so he could marry her, the same fear would exist even if he redeems her.
The rabbis explain the difference between a man who redeems and testifies on behalf of the woman and one who merely testifies on her behalf. Since the former spent money to redeem her, we can assume that he really believes that she was not raped. He wouldn’t have spent money just to redeem a woman prohibited to him. But if he merely testifies that he believes she was not raped, we must fear that he is lying.<br>[This is not a straightforward assumption. After all, we suspect a man might falsely testify, but we don’t suspect he would spend money to get a wife prohibited to him. This seems strange to me. Therefore, I would read our concerns over false testimony not that he intentionally lies. Rather, we fear he says that he knows something even if he is not absolutely certain of it.]

Daf 37a

Introduction<br>This week’s daf continues to deal with R. Judah’s statement from the mishnah, that we do not assume that a woman taken captive was raped. Is this really his position? Is it consistent with his position elsewhere? 
We now learn another source which according to R. Papa b. Shmuel proves that R. Judah does not hold that a captive woman is assumed to be a virgin. The baraita refers to two issues concerning a convert. The first is a case where she begins to menstruate immediately after conversion. The question is whether she is treated like all Jewish women who retroactively defile things they touched before they noticed they were menstruating. According to R. Judah she does not. She only defiles that which she touches from that point onward. According to R. Yose she is like all other women. She retroactively defiles anything she touched either in the last twenty-four hours, or from the last time she examined herself.<br>According to R. Judah, she also must wait three months before marrying, in order to distinguish a child conceived before she became Jewish and one from after she converted. R. Yose says she need not wait.<br>The fact that R. Yose says she need not wait implies that she we do not assume she had sex before converting (assuming she has not yet been married). Therefore, R. Judah would say that we must be concerned that she was raped. And at this point, it seems that R. Judah equates all non-Jews with captors. To R. Judah, a woman who converts is assumed to have had sex within the past three months. 
R. Joseph replies that the comparison is invalid. A convert, meaning a woman before she converts, does not know that she is eventually going to convert. Therefore, she does not protect herself from having sex (outside of marriage). Thus, R. Judah would hold that she must wait to get married, lest she became pregnant while still a non-Jew. In contrast, a captive will protect herself, knowing that she will be redeemed. Therefore, R. Judah assumes that she remains a virgin.<br>A word about rabbinic attitudes towards non-Jews: Rabbis at times assume the worst about non-Jews, that they are murderers, fornicators, robbers, etc. Part of this might be the experience of a people occupied by foreign rulers (Romans or Babylonians), but part of this might also be a general human tendency to demonize the other. The rabbis may cast the gentiles in the worst light as a way of imagining what the worst possibilities are for human beings.<br>By the medieval period, and certainly in the modern period, these attitudes towards non-Jews had changed, at least among modern Jews. So while I can understand the Talmudic attitude, I think we should be thankful that nowadays, things are different. 
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues to question the notion that R. Judah holds that a woman taken captive is not assumed to have been raped. It sharpens the difficulty by noting a baraita in which R. Judah explicitly states that a woman taken captive must wait three months to get married (or continue sleeping with her Israelite husband) lest she have become pregnant while taken captive.
According to this baraita, R. Judah holds that anyone who goes from a state of not being Jewish, not being free, or of being a captive, must wait three months before marrying, so that we can determine if the child was conceived by the captor, or before the woman converted or was freed. [The words older than three years and one day seem to be a mistake here, perhaps from the context of virginity claims. Obviously a three year old cannot be pregnant].<br>Yose again has no such concern. This proves that R. Judah holds that we must assume that a captive woman was raped.
Joseph does not know how to respond to this difficulty. So he asks R. Papa b. Shmuel to solve the contradiction. The latter does so by citing a teaching of R. Sheshet who says that R. Judah refers to a case where people saw her have intercourse with her captor (or in the other cases that she had intercourse with someone). Of course in such a case we must be concerned that she is pregnant. But in any other case, we need not be concerned.
The problem is that if someone says they saw her have intercourse before conversion, redemption or manumission, then why would R. Yose assume that she was not pregnant. In other words, the resolution to the difficulty on R. Judah, causes a difficulty on R. Yose.<br>Rabbah resolves this by stating that to R. Yose, a woman who fornicates (basically this means non-marital sex) is assumed to use contraception. Therefore we can assume that she is not pregnant.
The Talmud analyzes whether it makes sense to assume that these women used contraception before they became free or Jewish. In most cases, the Talmud agrees that it makes sense. The woman might not want to become pregnant at that point. A convert might want to wait until conversion to have a child, so that the child would be Jewish. A captive would not want to become pregnant, for she might be redeemed. A slave might have overheard that she is about to be set free, and therefore want to wait until that point to become pregnant.
The problem is the case of a slave woman who is freed because her master put out her tooth or eye (all slaves go free when this occurs). How can R. Yose assume that she used a contraceptive device? She could not have known beforehand that this would happen. This is similar to a (Jewish) woman who was raped or seduced—she too did not know beforehand that this would occur, and yet R. Yose says that we assume she is not pregnant, and therefore she can be betrothed and married immediately.
Rabbah now offers a new interpretation for R. Yose—a woman does not use a contraceptive device. Rather, she simply turns over so that she won’t get pregnant. This is something that all women do when they have non-marital sex, even a woman who didn’t know that she was about to have sex. [This is how Rashi explains the sugya. Otherwise we would have to ask the same questions as above—why would these women act in order to prevent conception. How would they have known that it is in their best interest not to become pregnant?].<br>Judah (rightly) questions the effectiveness of such a contraceptive action. Turning over is very unlikely to prevent pregnancy. Therefore we must be concerned.
Introduction<br>Today’s section goes on to deal with the next line of the mishnah. According to the Mishnah the notion that one cannot get two punishments for the same crime is derived from Exodus  21:22, the passage where a man accidentally strikes a woman and causes her to miscarry. If the woman dies, he does not pay for the fetuses. This, according to the rabbis, is because he gets the death penalty for killing the mother.
The Talmud suggests that the principle that one is obligated for only one penalty is derived from Deuteronomy 25:2, which uses the singular in reference to punishing a person for a transgression. He is punished for one wickedness (transgression) but not for two transgressions. So why does our mishnah use a different verse?
The Talmud, as it often does, argues that both verses are needed, for they address different situations, and one could not be derived from the other.<br>If only the first text from Exodus was used, I might have thought that one cannot be executed and fined because execution is such a stringent penalty. But perhaps we would have thought that someone could be lashed and still pay a fine, because lashing does not involve a loss of life. That is why we need to learn that one cannot receive lashes and a financial penalty.
If we had learned only that one cannot be lashed and receive a financial penalty, I might have thought that this is because the transgression for which one is lashed is not so grave. That is why he receives only one penalty. But since the transgression punishable by death is graver, I might have thought that one gets the death penalty and is fined. Therefore, we need another verse to teach us that one who gets the death penalty is not also fined.
Meir holds that one may be lashed and still pay a penalty. So this leaves him without an answer as to why we need two verses both teaching that one cannot receive two penalties for one crime.<br>Meir could answer that we need the two verses to teach that one cannot receive the death penalty and pay the fine, nor can he be executed and lashed (this is not something we spoke about before, assumedly because it’s strange—why would you lash someone and then execute them?).

Daf 37b

Again, the Talmud argues that both texts are needed. I need one text to teach that we do not punish someone’s body (death) and his property (fine) for one crime. But I might have thought that lashing a person and then killing him is like one long death penalty, and therefore it could be done. That is why we need a verse to teach us that a person does not receive lashes and the death penalty for one crime.
If we had only learned that one cannot be executed and receive lashes, we might have said that this is because both are against his body. But we might have thought that a person could be executed and forced to pay a fine for the same crime. Therefore, the Torah had to teach us both. According to R. Meir, one can get lashes and pay a fine, but not death and another punishment.<br>For an in-depth discussion of Daf Shevui, you can sign up to our Facebook page group at: 
Introduction<br>The Talmud now continues to ask why we need biblical verses that seem to teach that one cannot give out two penalties for one transgression.
At first it might seem like Numbers 35:31 teaches the same principle as we have been learning—when a person is executed, he does not also pay the fine. However, this is not what the verse is really teaching. The verse teaches that it is forbidden for a court to take a ransom to allow a murderer to avoid execution. It does not teach that one cannot get the death penalty and also pay a fine.
The very next verse in Numbers teaches that the court cannot take a ransom to exempt an accidental murderer from having to flee to a city of refuge.
The Talmud asks now why we need both texts, one dealing with intentional murder and the other with unintentional killing. The answer is similar to the answer found in yesterday’s section. If we had learned that the court cannot take a ransom to exempt a person from the death penalty, we might have thought that this is because the prohibition of murder is so severe. But accidental killing is not severe (it was an accident, after all) and therefore, one could pay a ransom to get out of having to flee to the exile city. Therefore, the verse teaches us that even for exile one cannot pay a ransom.
If we had only learned that the court cannot receive a ransom to allow an accidental killer to avoid having to flee to the refuge city, we might have thought that this is because this is not such a severe punishment. His life is not taken, therefore, he is not allowed to pay a ransom. But we have thought that a person condemned to execution is allowed to avoid the punishment by paying a ransom, because we wish to avoid execution. Therefore, both texts are necessary. Under no circumstances can one atone for murder or accidental killing by paying a fine.
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues to present interpretations for Numbers 35, the section of the Torah about murder and accidental murder, as well as other related passages.
The verse requires that a murderer’s blood be shed (this is probably the original reason why Jewish execution was done through decapitation, although a different, more midrashic, reason will be expressed below). The Talmud asks why we need to know this—there are other verses that seem to say the same thing. The answer is related to the passage in Deuteronomy about breaking a heifer’s neck if a murderer cannot be found. If the heifer’s neck is broken, and then the murderer is found, the murderer still must be executed. This is read out of the verse from Numbers—atonement cannot be made except by the blood of the one who shed it. Even if the heifer already effected atonement, the murderer must still be executed.
The verse from Deuteronomy concerning the method of breaking the heifer’s neck is used as the source for the halakhah that execution for murder is done by cutting the head off at the neck. This is derived from the fact that the verse is phrased as a generality—all clean blood is expunged by something being cut at the neck, either the heifer, when the murderer is not known, or of the murderer himself.
The heifer’s head is chopped off with an axe at the back of its head. But the murderer is killed with a sword from the front of the neck. If execution is derived from how the heifer is killed, why the discrepancy?<br>The answer is a midrash on “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” This is understood to refer even to a case where you are executing your neighbor—choose for him a good way to die. There are several ways in which this could be understood. The first has to do with honor. Chopping someone’s head off the same way you would chop off the head of an animal is not an honorable way to die. It is not a “good death.” The second could be with the type of wound inflicted. It could be that the ax is a more gruesome method than the sword, or that the back of the neck is more brutal than the front, where the death might be quicker. In any case, I think it’s the principle that is most interesting—even in execution, we are commanded to love our neighbor.
The Talmud now asks the meaning of another verse, which the Talmud reads as if it refers to a person who has been sentenced to death (this is not the simple meaning of the verse). The baraita refers to a person who vows to give to the Temple another person’s value. This is the topic of chapter 27 in Leviticus. But, we learn here that if a person is being led out to execution, he has no worth. However, if he has not yet been sentenced, then he still has a value, so if someone dedicates him to the Temple, they must pay his value. Note that the value of a person is fixed in the Torah—it depends on gender and age.
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues where we left off yesterday. According to a baraita we read there, if a person dedicates to the Temple the value of a person being taken out to be executed, he does not owe that value, because such a person has no value. Today we learn of dissent on this issue.
According to R. Hananiah b. Akabia, such a person can have his value dedicated to the Temple, because his value is determined by age and gender and is not related to his actual real worth value (which in this case is basically zero).<br>So what then does he do with this verse, “None proscribed,” the verse that received a midrash in yesterday’s section.
There is one case in the Torah in which a person may get out of the death penalty by paying a ransom. This is the case of an owner whose ox (or other animal) kills a person. The Torah says that the owner can be put to death, which the rabbis read as “death by the hand of heaven.” However, if the owner pays a ransom, i.e. the value of the person the ox killed, he does not received “death by the hand of heaven.” R. Ishmael says that we might have thought that just as one can pay a ransom to avoid death by the hand of heaven, one can also pay a ransom to avoid death by a court. Therefore, the verse teaches that none proscribed (sentenced to execution) by a man can pay a ransom. This might have been read as referring only to “severe death penalties.” Severe death penalties are cases where a person cannot receive atonement even if he does the sin unwittingly (according to Rashi this refers to kidnapping and wounding one’s parents). The word “none” teaches that the same is true even for sins which can be atoned for if committed unwittingly, such as idol worship, Sabbath laws and fornication. In short, in all cases, one who has been sentenced to death cannot avoid execution by paying a fine.
The Talmud now asks a logical question—why do we need a special midrash to teach that one may not pay a ransom to avoid execution? There is a verse that states this explicitly! Rami b. Hama answers that both the verse and the midrash are needed lest I think that if one kills another person with a downward motion, he may pay a ransom to avoid the death penalty because had he done so accidentally he would have been able to receive atonement by going to the city of exile. The idea is that when someone kills with a downward motion it could be an accident, whereas killing with an upward motion is assumed to be on purpose. Only the former can be atoned, the latter cannot.<br>Thus both verses are needed to emphasize the same point the Talmud has been emphasizing throughout—under no circumstances may one pay a ransom to avoid the death penalty. This is true whether the sin was done in a manner that could have allowed for atonement, had it been done accidentally, or not.

Daf 38a

Introduction<br>At the end of last week’s daf Rami b. Hama stated that the verse, “None proscribed, that may be proscribed of men” teaches that it does not matter whether one killed with an upward or downward motion, a ransom can never be taken in order to exempt the murderer from the death penalty. Today’s section continues from that point, with Rava saying that we could have learned that halakhah from a different source.
The tanna of the House of Hezekiah source was found above on daf 35, part 1. This baraita was directly dealing with the issue of what punishment is meted out to a murderer—execution or a fine? The source teaches that there is no distinction between murdering with an upward motion and murdering with a downward motion—the murderer never pays the fine. And just as there is no case in which a murderer pays a fine, so too there can be no distinction between killing with an upward motion and killing with a downward motion with regard to paying a ransom to exempt himself from the death penalty.<br>Since this halakhah emerges from the House of Hezekiah source, we don’t, Rava argues, need to derive the same halakha from the extra verse, “None proscribed…” This leaves us without a solution as to why we need that verse. Stay tuned for tomorrow, where we will finally answer—what does that verse really teach us?
Introduction<br>Rami b. Hama again answers why we need several verses that all seem to teach that one cannot take a ransom to allow a person to escape execution.
Rami b. Hama says that that the verse “Do not take a ransom” is needed to teach the principle that a person who murders and commits another crime at the same time is executed and does not pay the fine, even though there is another verse that could teach the same law. I might have thought that if someone puts out someone’s eye and thereby kills him, he is executed and does not pay for putting out his eye. But if he blinds him and kills him in a different way, not connected to the eye, he would pay for the eye and be executed. Therefore we need another verse to teach the principle that he receives only the more severe of the two penalties.
Rava again says that the deduction that Rami b. Hama makes from the verse can be derived from elsewhere, causing the deduction to be unnecessary. Another teaching from the House of Hezekiah states one cannot be executed and pay a fine for putting out another person’s eye. Rava seems to take this to mean that one cannot receive two punishments for the same crime. [We should note that this is not the simple meaning of the source. The simple meaning is that when one puts out another person’s eye, he cannot be killed for the crime.]
Ashi answers that we need two verses to teach the principle that a criminal receives only one of the punishments lest we thought that since fines are an “innovation,” one could pay a fine and be executed. The concept of “innovation” is that since there is one thing illogical about the law, namely that one would pay more than the cost of compensation (for instance paying four or five fold for stealing and slaughtering an animal), the entire law might be illogical. This would allow us to think that under certain circumstances, a person could be executed and pay a fine. Therefore, we need two verses to teach us that this is not so.
Rabbah holds that one can be executed and still pay a fine, specifically because fines are an innovation. So what does Rabbah do with the extra verse, “None proscribed”? [Note that it is complex as to why this verse is now extraneous. Basically, if the verse, “And if there is no catastrophe” (if the woman he struck does not die, and he pays the fine for her miscarriages)  teaches that a person does not pay a fine if he is executed, and the verse “Do not take a ransom” teaches that one can never pay a ransom to get out of the death penalty, the verse “None proscribed” becomes extraneous.]<br>Rabbah could explain this verse like the Tanna (the anonymous opinion) that argues with R. Hanania b. Akavia (see page 37, sections 5-6). According to this tanna, this verse refers to a one who dedicates the value of a person who is being taken out to be executed. According to this tanna, since such a person is about to be executed, he has no value, and the one who dedicated his value is exempt from any payment.
Introduction<br>In the chapter that describes rape in Deuteronomy the Torah refers to a “young girl, a virgin who has not been betrothed”.  The rabbis understand that this verse means that the laws of paying the fine are limited to a “young girl” that is a girl between the ages of 12 and 12 ½ and a virgin.  The mishnah which now appears in the Talmud discusses the meaning of the phrase “who has not been betrothed”.
In the case, a girl was betrothed and then either widowed or divorced, and then she was raped or seduced. The question is—does she receive a fine? Note that if she was betrothed but not divorced or widowed and someone raped her, he would be liable for the death penalty for having committed adultery (she would of course not be liable since she did not willingly commit any crime).  In this case, since he is liable for the death penalty, he does not pay a fine.<br>According to Rabbi Yose the Galilean since the Torah states, “who has not been betrothed” the rapist in this case does not pay the fine.<br>Rabbi Akiva reads the phrase “who has not been betrothed” to be a stipulation for when the father receives the fine. If she has never been betrothed, then her father receives a fine.  If she has been betrothed, but she is still a virgin, for instance she was divorced or widowed before full marriage, the rapist is liable to pay a fine and he pays it directly to her.<br>We should note that R. Akiva’s reading is clearly innovative. The Torah does not seem to assume the possibility of an independent woman. She is either in her father’s house or her husband’s. R. Akiva, and other rabbis elsewhere, carve out some space for the independence of a woman. In this case, despite the origins of the fine as compensation to the father for losing the bride price, she receives the fine.
Yose the Galilean’s reasoning in the mishnah is clear. Since she has been betrothed, she loses the right to collect a fine. To connect this to its historical roots—the father was paid the bride price by the first husband. If she is betrothed and then divorced before marriage, a man who subsequently has relations with her is not depriving the father of the bride price. Therefore, there is no fine.
As I explained above, R. Akiva reads the verse differently. If she had never been betrothed, the father receives the fine. If she was betrothed, she receives the fine. We should note that R. Akiva seems to read the fine as a punishment for the rapist. While this may find favor in our eyes (obviously a rapist deserves severe punishment), it does not accord particularly well with the simple meaning and interpretation of the verse. Nevertheless, we might add that the very fact that the rabbis call this a “penalty (קנס)” probably implies that most rabbis view this as a penalty, and not a replacement for the lost bride price.
These lines raise a difficulty on R. Akiva’s line of thinking. R. Akiva reads the words “who was not betrothed” to imply that if she was betrothed, she receives the fine. Extending this logic we would say that the word “a na’arah,” to mean that if the girl is between 12 and 12.5, but if she is older, her father receives the fine. Furthermore, the word “a virgin” would mean that if she was a virgin, her father would receive the fine, but if she was not a virgin, she would receive the fine. We should note that these are not illogical readings of the verse. But this is not how R. Akiva himself reads the verse. He reads the latter exclusions as complete—if she is not a na’arah, there is no fine; if she is not a virgin, there is no fine. So too he should read the other exclusion as complete. If she was betrothed, there is no fine.<br>To put this another way, if R. Akiva reads the payment as a fine for the very act of rape, why doesn’t it apply in all cases of rape? Indeed, this is a very good question.
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues from yesterday’s section where we learned that according to R. Akiva, if the girl has been betrothed and then divorced and then is raped or seduced, there is a fine, but the fine goes to her instead of to her father. The problem with R. Akiva’s statement is how does he interprets the words “who has not been betrothed” which would seem to mean that if she had been betrothed, there is no fine whatsoever.
The baraita cited here is parallel to the Mishnah. As in the Mishnah, R. Yose the Galilean says that if a girl was once betrothed, she never subsequently receives the fine.
Akiva in this baraita holds that if the girl was betrothed and then divorced, she is still subject to the laws of the fine. However, in this baraita, as opposed to the Mishnah, he states that logic dictates that the father receives the fine. If the father has the right to the money received for her betrothal, then he would still receive the fine, even though she had already been betrothed.<br>[Note that later the Talmud will ask how R. Akiva in this baraita can so obviously disagree with R. Akiva from the Mishnah].
Akiva does not interpret the words “Who has not been betrothed” to mean that the girl was never betrothed. After all, to R. Akiva in this baraita, it does not matter whether she was betrothed or not, the father still receives the fine. So then what does he do with those words? He uses them to draw a “gezerah shavah,” a linguistic analogy, between the verse in Deuteronomy, where the exact amount of the fine is stated, and the parallel in Exodus 22:15, where the amount is not stated. Just as in Deuteronomy, the fine for rape is 50 shekels, so too in Exodus, the fine for seduction is 50 shekels.


Daf 38b

Introduction<br>Today’s section continues to explain the baraita that appeared above.
Akiva uses the phrase “who has not been betrothed” to connect the verses in Deuteronomy with those in Exodus. And the word “virgin” he interprets literally—if she is not a virgin, she receives no fine. But this is not necessarily logical. He could have interpreted the phrase “who has not been betrothed” literally—if she was betrothed and then divorced she does not receive the fine. And he could have used the word “virgin” to connect Deuteronomy with Exodus (the word appears in both places).<br>To put this another way, the essential question is, why does he sometimes understand the verse literally and at other times midrashically?
The first attempt to answer this difficulty is to point out that even though she has been betrothed and then divorced, she is still a virgin and a na’arah. Therefore, this verse should apply to her and she should receive the fine.
The last answer was not truly logical. I could say that the word “virgin” is only meant to be used as a reference to Exodus. A non-virgin would still receive the fine, as long as she has not yet been betrothed. Again, we do not have an answer as to why one word is taken literally (“virgin”) and one is not (“who has not been betrothed”)
The Talmud now arrives at what is probably the real reason why R. Akiva reads one word literally and the other as a literary reference to Exodus. A woman who is no longer a virgin has had a physical change in her body. This physical change causes a real change in the law—she no longer receives the fine. But betrothal is only a change in her legal status. Therefore, as long as she is not betrothed when the rape/seduction occurs, then she is still eligible for the fine.
Yose the Galilean now needs to explain where he derives the halakhah that the payment for rape and seduction are the same. He does so from the words “according to the bride-price of virgins.” This verse sets a standard. The bride-price of virgins is the same as the payment for seduction—fifty shekels.
Introduction<br>In the Mishnah, R. Akiva states that a girl who has been betrothed and then divorced before marriage still receives the fine, but that since she was betrothed, she herself receives the fine, not her father. In contrast, in the baraita, he says that the father receives the fine.
The answer to the difficulty is quite simple—these are indeed two different opinions, transmitted by two different people, each a different version of what R. Akiva said.
The Talmud now evaluates each of the versions of R. Akiva. The version in the mishnah, that she receives the fine, is closer to the simple meaning, because it retains a difference between a girl that was never betrothed (fine goes to father) and one that was betrothed and then divorced (fine goes to her). But the version in the baraita is far removed from the simple meaning for in either case the father receives the fine. Did the words “who was not betrothed” really come just to teach a gezerah shavah, a linguistic comparison, with the verse in Exodus?
Nahman b. Yitzchak says that R. Akiva in the baraita is based on a different pronunciation of the word. Instead of “orasah” which means “has not been betrothed” he reads “who is not betrothed.” Thus as long as she is not currently betrothed, the father receives the fine.<br>The problem is that the verse is now too obvious. If a man rapes a girl who is betrothed, he receives the death penalty, not a fine! The answer is that were it not for the verse I might have thought that he would pay the fine and be executed. The verse therefore teaches he pays the fine only if she is not betrothed.
Rabbah holds that one can pay a fine and still be executed. So then he could not explain the verse as if it means “who is not betrothed” for according to Rabbah if one rapes or seduces a betrothed virgin, he would pay the fine and be executed.<br>Therefore, Rabbah must hold like R. Akiva in the Mishnah. The verse is now read in its normal fashion—she has never been betrothed. In such a case the father receives the fine. But if she was betrothed and then divorced, she receives the fine.
A baraita is cited in which two opinions dispute whether she receives the fine, or her father. R. Hisda interprets this baraita as referring to a virgin who was betrothed and then divorced and in line with the difference between R. Akiva of the Mishnah (she receives the fine) and R. Akiva of the baraita (father receives the fine).
Introduction<br>Today’s section deals with a case where the girl who was raped or seduced dies before the fine is paid.<br>As I’ve said many times, I realize that talking about these situations is disturbing. I too am disturbed when I constantly I have to describe situations in which young girls may be raped, although I am cognizant that my being disturbed does not mean that this does not occur in the real world. I do believe the rabbis were talking theoretically, envisioning scenarios and not responding to real life situations. Their discussions are clinical to a large extent, like those of a physician or mathematician. But I realize that seeing the word rape over and over is difficult. We should also note that the rabbis engage in midrash with the entire Torah, whether or not it had practical ramifications or applications in their own lives. The fine for rape or seduction was no longer a real institution that was enforced in rabbinic times.
Abaye reads the words “the girl’s father” as implying that if the girl dies before the father succeeds in collecting the fine, the father loses the right to the fine.
Rava asks about a case where the liability for the fine occurs (rape or seduction), then the girl dies and then before the fine is paid, she reaches the age of maturity (had she been alive). Had she been alive and then reached the age of maturity, the fine would have been hers. But do we consider her posthumously reaching the age of maturity to be the same? If we do, the fine goes to her offspring. If we do not, then the fine stays with her father.

Daf 39a

The Talmud goes on a small digression here about whether a girl can become pregnant while a minor. According to R. Meir she can, and therefore she should use a contraceptive device because of the danger to her health of giving birth while a minor. According to the other sages, a minor will not become pregnant because God will protect her (I wouldn’t advise relying on this advice).<br>There are two other categories of women whom R. Meir allows to use contraception. A pregnant woman is the first. The rabbis seem to have believed that the pregnant woman could again be impregnated and that this could damage the already conceived fetus. A nursing woman could use contraception so that she doesn’t get pregnant again and have to wean her first child too early.<br>The problem is that Rava seems to believe that a young girl can become pregnant and have a child all before reaching majority age. According to the sages in this source, that is not possible.
The girl under discussion must have been raped/seduced as a minor such that she could have a child to inherit her and then die before reaching majority age. She could not have had sex as a na’arah, because there is only six months between na’arut (the period in between a minor and a girl of majority age) and reaching maturity, and we know she died before reaching maturity. So again we must ask, how can a minor become pregnant?
The question is therefore adjusted. Rava asked if the father’s right to the fine is lost if his daughter dies and then hits majority age before he collects. This question, for which Rava does not have an answer, is that which Abaye did know above.
Here is yet another version of the issue, this time formed in a direct question by Mar son of R. Ashi, a late amora.<br>However, there is no answer to the question. It remains undecided.
Introduction<br>Our section continues to ask questions about whether a girl’s father would receive the fine under certain scenarios.
Rava asked Abaye if the girl who was raped/seduced is then betrothed before the fine is collected, does her father still receive the fine. In other words, she was not betrothed at the time of the rape/seduction, but she was betrothed before the money was collected. Does she count as a betrothed girl who does not receive the fine?
Abaye responds that the answer to this question is obvious. The Torah says that the girl was not betrothed at the time of the rape/seduction. It does not say that she can’t be betrothed at the time that the husband gives the money to the father. Of course the father receives the money.
Rava now responds with a baraita that seems to prove the fault in Abaye’s line of reasoning. The baraita states that if the girl is married (not just betrothed) before the fine is given to the father, she gets the fine, not her father. This is true even though the Torah does not explicitly say that the girl must not be married when the fine is given to the father. Rava in other words is saying that we cannot prove anything from the absence of such words in the verse.
Abaye rejects Rava’s comparison. Marriage is like becoming of majority age—she is no longer under her father’s authority. Therefore, just as we have learned that if she reaches majority age before the fine is paid, she receives the fine, so too if she is married before she reaches majority age, she receives the fine. But betrothal does not remove her completely from her father’s authority, for we have learned that he may still invalidate her vows. Therefore, it may be that even if she is betrothed, it is still her father who receives the fine.
Introduction<br>This introduction is from the Mishnah Yomit commentary.<br>The Torah discusses the “seducer” in Exodus 22:15-16:  “If a man seduces a virgin who has not been betrothed and lies with her, he must make her his wife by payment of a bride-price.  If her father refuses to give her to him, he must still weigh out silver in accordance with the bride-price for virgins.”  The rabbis learned that the bride-price referred to in these verses is the same as the 50 shekels referred to in the verses which discuss the rapist in Deuteronomy 22.  Therefore, both a seducer and a rapist must pay a fine of 50 shekels to the father, equivalent to the bride-price which the father would have received had he married her off in a typical fashion.  This mishnah discusses the other types of payments that the rapist and the seducer must pay and other differences between the two.
<b>Section one:</b> The seducer pays three types of payment:  1)  for having shamed her; 2) for having caused her to be “blemished”; 3)  the fine. The first two of these types of payments will be described in greater detail in mishnah seven. The rapist must make an additional payment for the pain he has caused her. Since the women willingly had relations with the seducer, he does not pay for the pain.<br><b>Section two:</b>  The mishnah now relates three differences in the penalties of a seducer and those of a rapist.  The first was already mentioned above. The second is that a rapist must pay immediately, whereas the seducer pays only if he decides not to marry her.  This difference is derived from the fact that with regard to the seducer the verse states, “If her father refuses to give her to him, he must weigh out silver” (Ex. 22:16).  By inference we can conclude that if the father does not refuse, then the seducer does not pay.  In contrast, Deuteronomy 22:28 states, “The man who lay with her must pay the girl’s father fifty shekels of silver.”  In this case the ruling is stated unconditionally.  Hence he must pay whether or not the father allows the couple to remain married.<br>The final difference is that a rapist is not allowed to initiate divorce against the woman.  This is derived from the Deut. 22:28, “Because he has violated her, he can never have the right to divorce her.”  In contrast, the seducer is allowed to divorce his wife.<br>[I realize that the idea that the victim of a rape would somehow be rewarded by the rapist having to marry her and never being allowed to divorce her, sounds cruel to our modern sensibilities.  However, if we understand that we are talking about a society where a woman may have been “ruined” and hence unable to get married after having been raped, we will realize that the intent of the law is to protect the woman.  By forcing him to marry her, the Torah affords her the economic protection of a husband, economic protection that may have been quite necessary in ancient society.]<br><b>Section three:</b>  The rapist must marry the woman whom he has raped, even if she has some physical handicap that makes him not want to marry her.  He lost his right to decide whether or not he wanted to marry her when he raped her.<br><b>Section four:</b>  However, he may not marry a woman who is halakhically forbidden to him.  After all, if this were not so, a man could rape a woman and thereby allow himself to marry a woman who would have otherwise been forbidden to him.  The mishnah lists two types of such women.  The first is a woman who “has committed a licentious act”.  This refers to a woman who committed adultery after he had married her.  As is always the case, a husband may not continue to live with his wife if she had committed adultery.  If in this case, the rapist married the woman and then she committed adultery, he may not remained married to her.<br>The second example is a woman who is not allowed to marry an Israelite, such as a mamzeret or a natinah.  If he raped such a woman, he may not marry her, and if he did marry her, he must divorce her.  Similarly, if he was a kohen and he raped a divorcee, he is not allowed to marry her.  This halakhah is derived from a midrashic reading of the words “And she shall be for him a wife”, which are read by the rabbis to mean that the woman must be halakhically “fit” to be his wife.  If she is not, he is allowed to divorce her.
Introduction<br>According to the mishnah, the rapist pays compensation for the pain. The mishnah asks what the pain is.<br>I want to warn you that this section can be particularly difficult to read. The rabbis do not consistently take into account the psychological pain of rape. For the most part, the pain they recognize is physical. This may be found disturbing because today we recognize the deep emotional pain caused by being forced to have sex.
According to Shmuel’s father, the pain the rapist must compensate his victim for is not the rape itself, but for the pain of being thrown onto the ground.
Zera cites a baraita to raise a difficulty on Shmuel’s father. In this baraita, R. Shimon argues that the rapist does not pay for the pain. He assumes that the pain is the pain of first intercourse. Since the woman will eventually suffer this pain when she is married, the rapist does not owe it. [I know the insensitivity of this statement is overwhelming]. The other sages answer that he must pay for the pain he causes, because one who has sex for the first time against her will is not the same as one who does so willingly. The former suffers far more physical pain, and it may be that this opinion takes into account the psychological suffering as well.<br>In any case, we can see here that the payment is for the rape itself. That is not to say that someone who inflicts other bodily harm while raping does not have to pay for that as well. What R. Zera is saying is that even if there is no other physical pain, for instance he throws her onto soft silk, the rape itself is painful and therefore must be compensated for.

Daf 39b

Nahman now revises what the pain payment is for. It is for the pain of forcing her to spread her legs.
Nahman now explains why the seducer does not pay for having her spread her legs. Since in the case of seduction the woman was willing, the seducer need not pay. It is as if she told him to tear up her silk garments but that she will not hold him liable.
The problem with R. Nahman’s analogy is that the girl who is being seduced does not have a right to forgo this payment, for it would go to her father. This is not because he experiences the pain, but rather because all financial benefit that comes from a young girl (a na’arah) goes to her father. So how can she tell the man to “tear up my silk garments.”<br>Nahman’s final answer is that there simply is no pain for a virgin being seduced. Even though she is losing her virginity, she experiences no pain. Perhaps this is a sign that the pain paid by the rapist is for psychological pain. Since the seduced woman experiences no psychological pain (she wanted to have sex), there is no payment for pain.<br>It is interesting that R. Nahman attributes this statement to women themselves. As a man, how could he know whether women experience pain at first intercourse?
Of course it does seem that in most circumstances sex is painful for a woman during her first time, even if she is having sex willingly. So how come he does not have to compensate her in the case of seduction? Three amoraim now give answers as to how much sex hurts the first time a woman has it. They have learned these answers from various women (obviously, a man could not know how much this hurts). The point seems to be that this does not hurt any more than do other things that might happen quite frequently. Pain requires compensation only if it is abnormal pain.
Introduction<br>According to the mishnah, the rapist pays the fine immediately, whereas the seducer pays the fine only when/if he divorces her. Our sugya discusses this section of the mishnah.
The mishnah assumes that the seducer has already married her. But we seem to have skipped a step—what if he does not marry her? Abaye therefore reads the mishnah differently. The seducer pays the father the fine if he does not marry her. If he marries her, then he really never does pay the fine. It just turns into the ketubah, which he will pay on divorce.
This baraita accords with Abaye in saying that the seducer pays the fine only if he does not marry her. It then goes on to give some other information. Unlike the fine, the shame and blemish payments must be paid immediately. The reason seems to be that these are not transformed by marriage into the ketubah. They are independent, a result of his not having gone through the proper channels of marriage. Therefore, he pays them immediately, regardless of whether he ends up marrying her.<br>Finally, the mishnah notes that in either case, either she or her father can refuse the marriage. As we will see below, this is not quite explicit in the Torah.
The Torah only says that the father of the seduced girl may refuse the marriage. It never says anything about refusing the marriage in the case of rape (Deuteronomy) or whether she may refuse the marriage in the case of seduction. The rabbis use midrash to derive that she may refuse in either case, but they do not derive, at least not in this midrash, that the father may refuse in the case of rape?<br>[We should note that rabbinic law is a major advancement here over Torah law. According to the rabbis a woman could never be forced to marry someone she does not want to, unless her father is marrying her off when a minor.]
Abaye and Rava both provide reasons why the father may reject the marriage in either case. According to Abaye, the father has a right to reject the marriage so that the sinner (the rapist) may not be rewarded by being able to marry the girl he raped.<br>Rava offers a fairly straightforward argument. If the father of the seduced girl is allowed to refuse the marriage even though the seducer acted only against the will of the father, the father of the raped girl should all the more so be allowed to reject the marriage, for the rapist acted against both of their will.
Since both Rava and Abaye give decent reasons as to why the father has a right to refuse, the Talmud now asks why each amora did not give the other’s answer.<br>Rava did not give Abaye’s answer because once the rapist has paid the fine, he really is not in the position of a sinner gaining a pure advantage. He has lost out by having to pay the fine.
Abaye says that we can’t really compare the situations of the rapist and the seducer with regard to the right of the father to refuse. When it comes to the seducer, the seducer himself is not obligated to marry her. Therefore, the father does not have the right to reject the marriage. This would destroy the “kal vehomer” and we could say that in the case of the rapist, since the rapist is forced to marry her (if she agrees), so too the father cannot reject the marriage.
The rapist must pay the fine immediately. It is not transformed into a delayed payment as it is for the seducer. However, the corollary is that when he divorces her, he does not pay the ketubah, because he already paid it. The problem with this law is that the rapist is not allowed to divorce her, unless she requests a divorce. So the Talmud emends it to read that if she requests a divorce, she does not receive a second ketubah.
As I stated before, according to the first opinion, her fine becomes her ketubah. She received her payment up front and not as a delayed payment. If he dies, she does not receive anything more.<br>Yose son of R. Judah says that he must give her an additional ketubah of one maneh, which is 100 zuz. This is the ketubah given for the widow or divorcee in all cases.
The Talmud explains the dispute between the rabbis and R. Yose. The rabbis hold that the reason for a ketubah is to serve as a deterrent for divorce. Since the rapist is not allowed to initiate divorce, there is no reason for such a deterrent. Therefore, if he dies, she still does not receive a ketubah. The other rabbis hold that if there is no deterrent, the rapist who eventually married the woman would torment her to convince her to ask for a divorce. Therefore, he needs a deterrent as well. Since she gets a ketubah if he divorces her, she also receives one if he dies.
The mishnah ruled that a rapist must marry the woman even if he does not want to. [Only she or her father may refuse the marriage]. But the seducer need not marry her. Rava asks why there is a difference, when in general the rabbis learned the laws of one case from the other. R. Ashi answers that there is a special midrash on Exodus, the passage the rabbis interpret as referring to the seducer. But this word “to be his” is not found in Deuteronomy. Therefore the rapist has no right to refuse the marriage. He must “drink from his pot.”

Daf 40a

Introduction<br>This week’s daf begins by discussing the mishnah’s ruling that the rapist does not marry the victim if she is prohibited to him, i.e. she is a mamzeret.
Kahana argues that the positive commandment of “he shall marry her” should outweigh the negative prohibition of not marrying a woman prohibited to him. We should note that it is not uncommon for a positive commandment to outweigh a negative one.
Zevid clarifies that a positive commandment supersedes a negative one only if the positive commandment must be performed, and observance of the negative commandment would make the positive commandment completely impossible. Such would be the case if one the spot where circumcision must be performed there was scale disease. It is prohibited in general to cut off scale disease through surgery, but in this case, if one observed this negative commandment, there would be no way to perform the positive one. So circumcision wins out. But in the case of the rapist, she has the right to refuse the marriage. So this is not a case of a positive commandment being prevented by a negative one. It is only a potential positive commandment.
Introduction<br>The mishnah which opens today’s section teaches that if the girl herself receives the fine, then she only receives it if she is raped.  If she consents to having relations with the man, he does not pay the fine.
In the case in this mishnah the fine surely would go to the girl, for her father is no longer alive.  In fact, as we shall see the Talmud explains that the despite the fact that the mishnah refers to an orphan, this mishnah actually refers to any girl who was betrothed and then divorced or widowed, and that the mishnah is according to the opinion of Rabbi Akiva in the earlier mishnah who stated that a girl who was betrothed and then divorced still receives the fine, but she gets it, not her father. A girl who was betrothed and then divorced is called “an orphan while her father is still alive” because once she is betrothed, she is out of her father’s domain.  In this case, if she was seduced then the man does not pay the fine because she consented.
According to R. Yohanan this mishnah accords with R. Akiva who said that if a girl was betrothed and then divorced, a subsequent fine for rape goes to her, not to her father.
The Talmud now shows how R. Yohanan derives from this mishnah that R. Elazar and R. Akiva agree. This mishnah cannot be referring to a real orphan. Obviously her father would not receive her fine—she has no father. Rather, this mishnah refers to a girl who was betrothed and then divorced before reaching majority age. At times the Talmud even calls her “an orphan in the life of her father” because her father no longer has any authority over her. According to both R. Akiva and R. Elazar she still receives the fine, but it goes to her.
The halakhah follows R. Elazar. It is interesting to note that this is one of the only halakhic rulings in this chapter. If, as I have said on many occasions, these laws were not practical halakhah, why was there a need for a halakhic ruling in this particular case? The answer probably is that there is a paradigm here. Once a girl has been betrothed, she is no longer in her father’s domain. While this may not have had practical implications with regard to the laws of fines, which were not practiced by this period, it does have practical implications in other areas of halakhah.
Introduction<br>Today’s section begins with a mishnah that lists the three types of payment that a seducer must pay.
<b>Section one:</b>  Embarrassment is relative to the social standing of the woman and the man.  The higher the social standing of the woman, the higher this payment will be, and the lower the social standing of the man, the higher the payment will be.  Others explain that a man of higher social standing will pay a greater payment because he embarrasses the woman more.<br><b>Section two:</b>  The blemish of a woman raped is calculated the same way that blemishes caused by other types of injury are calculated.  An estimate is made how much she would have been worth as a slave sold on the market before she had relations (either by seduction or rape) and how much she was worth afterwards.  This is the same way that an estimate would be made for a payment for blemish if, for instance, someone cut off someone else’s hand.  What is somewhat puzzling is why a virgin slave would be worth more than a non-virgin slave.  The Talmud supposes that a master may want to purchase a female virgin slave on behalf of his trustworthy male slave, one whom he might want to “reward”.<br><b>Section three:</b>  Any fine that is given a fixed sum in the Torah, is fixed and can never be raised or lowered.  Such is the case with the bride-price.  Therefore, a seducer will pay a fine of 50 shekels whether he has relations with a poor girl or with the daughter of a king.  Other examples of fixed sums in the Torah are an ox that kills a slave (Exodus 21:32) and a husband who makes a false virginity claim against his wife (Deut. 22:19)....
The Torah sets the fine for rape (and by extension seduction) at 50 selas. But the rabbis read this as only one of the payments a rapist/seducer pays. He must also pay the shame and blemish (and in case of rape, pain). The question is—how do they know this? Maybe the 50 selas should cover all the various aspects of the damage he has done?<br>Zera answers that the payment should reflect the social status of the woman seduced/raped. A fine that is the same for all women would not reflect this. While this sounds harsh to our ears (to mine too), we would do well to remember that this payment is in essence, the bride-price paid in advance. Put in those terms, we can more easily understand that not all bride-prices would have been the same. Today this might be reflected in wedding costs. Wealthy people have more expensive weddings than do the poor.
According to the Torah, someone who accidentally kills a slave pays 30 selas. This payment is fixed. But, Abaye argues, if R. Zera’s logic was right, then the payment for the slave should vary depending on his abilities. If he is a slave able to do high level work with jewelry, the one who accidentally kills him should have to pay higher compensation to the master.

Daf 40b

Zera offers another reason offers another reason why the 50 is only for the fine and not for all the payments. R. Zera refers to a situation where a woman first had “unnatural intercourse” (anal). If she was then seduced and had normal intercourse, the seducer would pay 50 shekels, even though she had already had intercourse. This would be no different from a case where a man seduces a virgin who has never had any type of intercourse. R. Zera believes that the payment of “shame” should reflect that. Put quite frankly, the woman who had never had intercourse would receive a higher “shame” payment for her shame is greater.
Abaye again retorts that the payment for accidentally killing a slave is the same no matter whether the slave is healthy or sick.<br>The essence of Abaye’s argument highlights the difference between the slave payment and the fine for rape or seduction. The rabbis viewed this fine as only one part of the payment the man makes for injuring her. In essence, they viewed rape (and seduction) as personal injury, and therefore added in the payments for personal injury. But the payment for killing a slave they left as the only compensation.
Abaye and Rava both find ways of reading the verses in Deuteronomy 22:29 as if they imply that the fine is only for the “laying” with her. But since he also shamed her and blemished her, he must also pay for those elements as well. These are “midrashim”—they are not the simple understanding of the verse. But when R. Zera fails to logically prove that he must pay for shame and blemish, the other amoraim are left to offer midrashic justification.
The Talmud now asks why the father receives these payments. After all, she was the one shamed and blemished. The initial answer is derived from a verse in Numbers which is read as if it states that all benefits that she gets when a youth (till 12.5 years) go to her father.
But what about that which R. Huna said in the name of Rav: From where do I know that a daughter’s handiwork belongs to her father? As it is said, “And if a man sell his daughter to be a slave”, just as the handiwork of a slave belongs to her master so does the handiwork of a daughter belong to her father.” Why do I need this? Let him derive it from “Being in her youth in her father’s house”? Rather that text was written in connection only with the annulment of vows?<br>Rav derived the halakhah that all handiwork produced by a young girl goes to her father from a verse that teaches that a father may sell his daughter into slavery (this was entirely theoretical by this period). This is another case of a father receiving financial benefit from his daughter. But the question is, why didn’t Rav use the verse from Numbers to prove that a girl’s handiwork goes to her father? The answer is that that verse refers only to a father’s ability to annul his daughter’s vows. This is indeed the context of the verses.
The Talmud now rejects deriving the law that the father receives the shame and blemish payments from two other payments/rights he does receive. We cannot argue that since he has the right to annul her vows he receives the payments, for in general we do not derive monetary laws from ritual matters. Annulling vows is considered a ritual matter. Second, we cannot derive it from the fact that he receives the fines, because we do not learn compensatory payments from fines.
The naked truth of the matter is that the father could shame her by marrying her off to a scoundrel or one with boils. Since he has the right to “shame” her in a sense, he receives the payment.<br>In the end, I think the real reason he receives the money is that he is in a sense shamed by her being raped or seduced. While today we think of all human beings as individuals, there are still cultures in which the “violation” of a female member of the family is considered to be a dishonor to all members of the family. This is why the father receives the payment, at least when she is young and still a member of his household. 
Introduction<br>Today’s section explains the “blemish” payment. I should again reiterate that this payment comes from the laws of personal injury and is similar to the “nezek” or “damages” payment from the eighth chapter of Bava Kamma.
The mishnah teaches that to assess the blemish payment, they would assess the woman’s previous and current slave value. This makes sense with regard to general injury. For instance, if someone cut off my hand, the blemish (i.e. damage) payment is how much I would be worth as a slave with my hand and how much without. This would depend on what my abilities were before and whether I could still perform them). However, when it comes to the woman who was raped or seduced, the payment seems a bit strange and out of place—how much more would a man pay to have a virgin female slave than a non-virgin one?
The Talmud offers that precise objection—why should an owner prefer a virgin slave? [The notion that he wants to have relations with her is not raised, for this is forbidden. In reality, I think it is understandable, albeit immoral, why a male owner might prefer a virgin slave]. The final answer is that he might want to marry her off to his own male slave, one whom he favors and therefore wants to find a virgin wife.
Introduction<br>According to Exodus 21:7 a father has the right to sell his daughter into slavery.  In interpreting this verse, the rabbis limited this right to when she is a minor, meaning before she both achieves puberty and reaches the age of 12 years [that is to say, one who has reached puberty but is not yet 12 or is 12 but has not reached puberty is still considered a minor].  After this age she is considered a “young woman” (na’arah) and her father may no longer sell her.  It is at this age that if she is raped or seduced her father receives a fine.  The period in which a woman is considered a “na’arah” can be no longer than six months.  After this period, she has reached what was considered to be majority age, and there is no fine incurred by one who rapes or seduces her.
When a girl is of an age where her father may sell her, according to our mishnah one who rapes or seduces her does not incur a fine.  This is learned exegetically from the fact that Deuteronomy 22:28 which discusses the fine for rape uses the word “na’arah”.  The mishnah concludes that only one who rapes or seduces a “na’arah” incurs the fine and not one who does so to a minor.<br>Finally, six months after becoming a “na’arah” a girl becomes a “bogeret”, one who has reached majority age.  At this point her father loses most of his rights vis a vis her.  He can no longer marry her off or sell her.  She is legally independent.  One who rapes or seduces her does not incur a fine.
Rav Judah notes that the mishnah above accords with R. Meir only. The other sages hold that there is overlap between the laws of the sale and the applicability of the fine. Basically, until she is of majority age the fine applies. She may only be sold before she is a na’arah. So the overlap is that both sets of laws apply until she is a na’arah.
Introduction<br>According to R. Meir, a minor girl does not receive a fine if she is raped or seduced. Today’s section discusses why he holds this why.
Hisda explains that R. Meir bases his law on the words “she shall be for him.” This implies that the verse refers only to a girl who can arrange her own marriage. This is true only for a “na’arah” a girl between the ages of 12 and 12 ½. A minor does not receive the fine.<br>The other rabbis say that the word “na’arah” implies that all girls receive a fine, up to and including the age of “na’arah.”
In this section we learn of a different tradition about what Resh Lakish said. Instead of the earlier tradition, here Resh Lakish refers to a man who falsely claims that his wife was not a virgin at the time of her marriage. The Torah refers to a na’arah. From here Resh Lakish said that if the man falsely accused a minor, he is not punished by having to pay the 100 shekels. [Again, by the time of the rabbis, this law was entirely theoretical.] We have not yet concluded the idea that this is the same tradition as above.
Adda b. Ahavah raises a difficulty on this second teaching of Resh Lakish. Resh Lakish implies that if the Torah had not called her a “na’arah” we would have applied the whole chapter to a minor. But this is impossible, because later in the chapter we learn that if the husband’s claim is true (according to rabbinic interpretation this means that she committed adultery) she is executed. But minors cannot be punished. Therefore, the chapter must refer only to a na’arah.
The Torah used the word “na’arah” here. But it didn’t need to. We could have figured this out on our own, because it could not have referred to a minor. This implies that anywhere else the Torah uses the word “na’arah” it includes a minor as well. This now is the same statement that Resh Lakish said above about the fine. Even though the Torah used the world “na’arah” it meant even a minor.

Daf 41a

Introduction<br>The concept taught in the mishnah found at the beginning of this daf is that one who admits of his own accord that he has committed a crime, without before having evidence brought against him, is exempt from paying the fine.  He must, however, pay any penalties that are compensatory and not considered fines.
<b>Section one:</b>  If a person admits that he seduced someone’s daughter he does not pay the fine.  He does, however, make the other payments.<br><b>Section two: </b> A thief is liable to pay back double the amount which he stole.  If he slaughtered or sold the animal he must pay back four or five times its value.  The double, fourfold and fivefold payments are fines, whereas the restitution for the principal is not a fine.  Therefore, if a man admits to having stolen something, he only pays the principal.<br><b>Section three:</b>  If a person’s ox kills someone or someone else’s ox, the ox owner must make financial restitution (see Exodus 21:30).  This is not considered a fine and therefore if a person admits that his ox killed another ox or a human being, he must make restitution.  However, if an ox kills a slave there is an automatic penalty of 30 shekels (see Exodus 21:32).  Since this is a fixed sum, a person who admits that his ox did so is not liable to pay the fine.<br><b>Section four:</b>  The mishnah now sums up what we learned above.  If a person is liable to pay a fine that is more than the actual damage, or actually a sum that is set arbitrarily and is independent of the damage, he doesn’t pay upon his own admission.  The reasoning behind this may be that fines are in order to prevent the person from committing another crime.  Therefore, if he comes forward and admits to what he has done (and it was not otherwise known) the need for a penalty does not exist.  On the other hand compensation is needed for the loss incurred by the victim and therefore compensatory penalties are paid in any case.
Introduction<br>The Talmud now begins to deal with the mishnah we learned yesterday.
The mishnah gives the example of a man who admits that “I have seduced so-and-so’s daughter.” It does not deal with the case where he states, “I have raped.” Why not?<br>The Talmud answers that if he says “I have raped” it is obvious that he must pay her. There is no shame to the woman’s character when he declares that he raped her—she was an innocent victim. Therefore, since he does not defame her, he must pay her compensation. But I might have thought that when he says “I seduced her” he should not be believed, because by believing him, her character is defamed as well. After all, she is being accused of having willingly slept with him. Therefore, the mishnah teaches that he is believed, despite the fact that believing him will in some way defame her character.
Shimon says, against the Mishnah, that if a man states that he seduced so-and-so’s daughter, he is not believed, for this would defame the daughter. Basically we do not allow any person to get up in court and defame someone else without proof, even if by defaming that person, the testifier would owe money to the one he defamed.
Papa asks what if the girl, or her father, or her family is okay with the seducer testifying that he seduced the girl. In other words, what if they prefer the man pay the compensation, even if this means that the girl will be defamed.<br>Abaye answers that we always have to worry that someone will not want to hear her being defamed. We cannot allow him to defame her because even if she doesn’t mind, she will be tarnished in someone else’s mind. On the one hand, this approach guards a person’s reputation. On the other hand, I do find it somewhat problematic for it takes away the choice of the person. Someone might prefer to be compensated, even though their reputation is tarnished.
Introduction<br>The mishnah taught that when one confesses to having committed a crime, he pays the principal, which is compensation for what he stole or damaged, but he does not pay the fine, which is beyond the compensatory amount. This sets up a paradigm—one who confesses pays any payment considered compensation, but he does not pay anything considered a penalty.<br>Today’s sugya begins a relatively well-known discussion over whether the payment of half damages is considered a fine or compensation. Half damages are what the owner of an animal pays if his animal damaged in an unusual or unexpected manner. For instance, if an ox that has never gored before, gores. This is discussed in the beginning of Bava Kamma.
Papa and R. Huna son of R. Joshua disagree over the status of the payment of half damages. R. Papa holds that they are really compensation. In reality, a person who’s ox damaged something should pay the full amount, because he should have known that oxen are dangerous. They cannot really be guarded. But since this was the ox’s first (or second) time damaging, and they had not yet become an attested danger, the Torah had mercy on him and obligated him to pay only half damages. In short, he should have paid full, but he is allowed to pay half.
Huna holds that half-damages are a type of penalty. Really, the owner should not have been liable to pay anything, because cattle are safe. But the Torah penalizes him by making him pay half damages in order to incentivize him to guard his cattle. In short, he should have paid nothing, but he is penalized into paying half.
Introduction<br>Today’s section begins a series of difficulties and supports for the positions of R. Papa and R. Huna from yesterday’s section—are half damages considered compensation (R. Papa) or a penalty (R. Huna)?
The sugya opens with a mnemonic device to help remember the order of the difficulties that are to be raised.<br>The first difficulty is a mishnah from Bava Kamma which teaches that both the plaintiff and the defendant share in the costs of the loss of the damages. This works for R. Papa, who holds that half damages are compensation. The plaintiff loses half of the money that really should be owed to him, so he too shares in the costs. But to R. Huna, who holds that half damages are a penalty, how does the plaintiff share in the costs—he really should not be receiving any payment whatsoever.
The answer is that the plaintiff shares in the loss if the value of the carcass decreases. When one ox kills another ox, the plaintiff owes the defendant the difference in value (or half the difference) between the dead ox and what it was worth when it was alive. So if the carcass is worth 50 and the live ox 200, the defendant will owe either 150 or 75, depending on whether the goring ox was an attested or unattested danger. If subsequently the value of the live ox is reduced, this loss goes to the plaintiff. This, according to R. Huna, is how he shares in the costs.
The problem is that we already have a baraita that teaches that the owners of the dead ox must deal with the carcass—i.e. if it goes down in value, the loss is theirs. So why would we need another mishnah to teach the same thing.<br>The answer is that one source refers to a mu’ad (an animal that is an attested danger) and the other to a tam (an unattested danger). We need both sources, the Talmud explains, lest we think that the rule that the defendant is responsible for the carcass applies only in one of these cases. It might refer only to the tam, because we might have not penalized the goring ox’s owner by making him take care of the carcass and absorb any loss in its value, since his ox had not yet been warned. On the other hand, it might refer only to the mu’ad, since the goring ox’s owner pays full compensation. This might have led us to think that he also must cover losses to the value of the carcass. Therefore we need both sources to teach us that the plaintiff always covers the loss of value to the carcass. This is how he too can at times share in the losses, and resolves R. Huna.
The mishnah quoted here teaches one difference between a tam and a mu’ad. For payments caused by damage by a tam, the owner pays from the value of the offending ox’s body—payments cannot go beyond what that ox is worth. But when it comes to the mu’ad who pays full damages, the defendant pays from his own estate.<br>If R. Huna was correct, that half damages are a penalty, the mishnah should have listed another difference. If the owner of a tam admits on his own accord that his ox damaged, he doesn’t pay, because we know that one who admits to owing a fine is not liable to pay the fine. But if the owner of a mu’ad admits that his ox damaged, he would owe the money because this is compensation, not a fine.
The answer the Talmud gives is that the teacher of the mishnah did not teach all of the differences between a tam and a mu’ad, just some. Since he left out at least one other difference, we can assume that he may have left out the difference mentioned above.<br>To prove this, the Talmud must now find a third difference between a tam and mu’ad. This difference is with regard to killing a person and paying the ransom, the value, of the person. The mu’ad would pay the ransom and the tam would not (this is derived from a midrash in Bava Kamma).<br>The Talmud answers that this might not really be an omission in the mishnah, because the mishnah might follow R. Yose the Galilean who holds that the tam does indeed pay half the ransom, just as the mu’ad does. So in the end, we don’t know if this mishnah is a difficulty on R. Huna. R. Huna could hold like the tanna who teaches that the tam does not pay the ransom at all, in which case this Mishnah is not an exhaustive list of differences between the tam and mu’ad.

Daf 41b

Introduction<br>In the last section of this chapter, the Talmud continues with difficulties on R. Huna’s position, that half damages are a penalty and not compensation. To recall, the ramification of this is that if someone admits on his own accord that his tam (unattested danger) ox damaged, he does not pay, because one is not liable to pay a fine based solely on his own admission.
This is a quote of the mishnah, which states explicitly that if a person testifies that his ox killed a person or another ox, he is obligated to pay. If this refers to a tam, whose owner would have to pay half damages, then this would be a difficulty on R. Huna. Therefore, the Talmud says that it refers only to a mu’ad, whose owner pays full damages, which are a form of compensation and not a penalty.
If the mishnah is referring only to a mu’ad, the implication would be that if the animal is a tam, the owner does not pay based on his own admission. But if this is so, the mishnah should have said so outright, instead of drawing the distinction it does draw between a case where a ox kills a free person and a case where ox that kills a slave (the owner pays 30 shekels, a fine and not compensation).<br>The answer is that the mishnah prefers to deal with a mu’ad, to teach us that in the case of a mu’ad that kills a slave the owner does not pay based on his own admission. Had the mishnah taught the distinction between a tam and a mu’ad, we might not have known this.
The last clause of the mishnah provides a general rule—if the payment is more than the damages, he does not pay based on his own testimony. This clause would lead to the inference that if the payment is less than the damages, i.e. half damages, then he does pay based on his own testimony. This is against R. Huna. But the Talmud rejects that inference, instead inferring that if the payment does not correspond exactly to the damages, then he does not pay based on his own testimony. Again, R. Huna’s position that half damages are a penalty is resolved, at least temporarily.
If the mishnah had meant to say that only the payment is equivalent to the damages he pays based on his own testimony then instead of saying “whoever pays more” does not pay based on his own testimony it should have stated, “whoever does not pay an amount corresponding to the actual cost of the damage he has done does not pay based on his own testimony.” The fact that the mishnah does not use these words is indeed a refutation of R. Huna.
The Talmud is perplexed. How can R. Huna be refuted and yet the halakhah follow his opinion that half damages are a penalty? The answer is that R. Huna was refuted by the fact that the mishnah did not teach, “whoever does not pay an amount corresponding to the actual cost of the damage he has done does not pay based on his own testimony.” But the mishnah could not have taught this, for even R. Huna would say that there is one case where half damages are compensation—the case of damage by pebbles. This is a type of indirect damages. The defendant pays half damages not because the offending animal was an unattested danger, but because the damages were indirect.
There is a principle that in Babylonia, or more precisely, outside of the land of Israel, fines are not collected. The idea is that the rabbis of Babylonia do not have the authority to do so. So if half damages are a fine, then they may not be collected in Babylonia. So if dogs eat lambs or cats eat big hens, both of which are unusual, payment may not be collected. But if they eat smaller animals, then the owner would be liable for full damages, and payment could be collected.
The Talmud seems to realize that there is a problem with not allowing the plaintiff to receive compensation for the property that was damaged. Therefore they find some alternatives to force the defendant to pay. First of all, if the plaintiff simply seizes the compensation, the court does not take it away from him. Second, if the plaintiff demands that the defendant go with him to court, the court in Babylonia sets a date for them to go. If the defendant does not go, he would either have to pay up, or be put under the ban.
Finally, one may not keep animals that are hazardous (or other hazards) to others in his house. If he does not must remove them he will be placed under the ban. This is derived from the verse that commands a person to set up a guard rail around his roof so that no one falls off. From here the rabbis learn that one must keep one’s house safe.
Well, I’m sure this was one of the harder or perhaps hardest chapters of Talmud you’ve ever learned, both in terms of subject material and in terms of complexity. So an extra congratulations on completing it. I think it is hard to appreciate the artistry of long and complicated arguments in a format such as Daf Shevui. It reminds me of that book “Zoom.” In Daf Shevui we zoom in on the details, but if we could see the overall structure of the rhetorical arguments, how the Talmud thoroughly examines every possible angle for every possible general principle, checking where it is derived from, where it is applicable, and whether it contradicts tradition, we would get a better sense of just how systematic this chapter really is.<br>The first half of the next chapter, which we will begin tomorrow, continues to deal with the same subject. So stay tuned!
Introduction<br>The mishnah which opens chapter four deals with the issue of who receives the payments if a girl is raped or seduced.
<b>Section one:</b>  This section teaches that all of the payments that are incurred by one who rapes or seduces a young girl are given to the father.<br><b>Section two:</b>  The mishnah now begins to deal with various situations in which the father died.  The question is:  does the money go to the girl herself, or does it go to her brothers who inherit her father?<br>If the case was tried before the father died and then her father died the payments go to her brothers.  This is because once the case was tried it is as if the father had already collected, even though he may not actually have collected.  In essence the rapist or seducer owes the father money.  Since this is so, when he dies, the seducer or rapist pays the money to the brothers, the father’s inheritors.<br>However, if the father died before the case was tried, the money belongs to her.  This is because at the point that it was determined that the rapist or seducer owes the money, she was already an orphan.<br><b>Section three:</b> This section deals with a situation in which the money has not been collected and she became of majority age.  At this age her father no longer receives money that she earns.<br>If the case was tried before she became of majority, and then the father died, the money goes to her brothers, for the same reasons outlined above.  Since the debt was owed to the father, the brothers inherit this debt.  However, if the case was not tried until after she became of majority age, the payments go directly to her, even if her father is still alive.<br><b>Section four:</b>  According to the opinion in the above sections, the point at which the debt is determined is the trial.  Rabbi Shimon disagrees and says that if she didn’t collect before her father dies, even if they have already been to trial, the money goes to her.  According to Rabbi Shimon, the father does not bequeath money that is owed to him to his sons.<br><b>Section five:</b>  While a daughter is in the status of a “na’arah” or younger all of her earnings belong to her father.  The mishnah teaches that any work she did or things that she found, even if they have not yet been collected (such as wages) already belong to her father.  If he dies they go to her brothers as part of their father’s inheritance.

Daf 42a

Introduction<br>This week’s daf begins analyzing the mishnah we concluded with last week.
The Talmud claims that the mishnah we learned at the end of last week’s daf seems to teach basically the same information that we learned in a mishnah appearing on daf 39—that the seducer pays compensation for embarrassment, blemish and the fine and the rapist also pays for the pain. So the only new information we learn in this Mishnah is that the father receives the payments.
It is even obvious that the payments go to the father. This is because we know that the seducer must make payment even though he acted with her consent. It would not make sense for him to pay her since she was a willing party. Therefore, it is obvious that the payments belong to the father. So we are still searching for a mishnah<br>The final answer is that the mishnah was necessary to teach us the dispute between R. Shimon and the other rabbis. The rabbis hold that if the father dies before he collects these payments, they belong to her brothers. R. Shimon holds that she receives the money.
Introduction
Today’s section begins with a mishnah from Shevuot. My commentary is basically taken from Mishnah Yomit Shevuot 5:4. Shevuot is about the consequences of making a false oath.<br>This mishnah teaches that in order for one who makes a false oath to be liable to bring a sacrifice he must deny something to which if he had admitted would have caused him to be liable. Since he is not liable to pay a fine for a self-admission, he is not liable if he denies owing a fine. He is liable only if he denies owing something which is considered financial compensation.
In the scenario in our mishnah a man approaches another man and accuses him of having raped or seduced his daughter and therefore owing him the 50 shekels, plus the other penalties we have learned about in the earlier mishnayot. The person responds that he didn’t do so, and then when the claimant adjures him (makes him take an oath), he affirms the adjuration. According to the first opinion in the mishnah, when he admits that he did in fact rape or seduce the other man’s daughter, he will be liable for a sacrifice for his false oath.  Of course he will also be obligated to pay the fine and the other financial penalties.<br>Rabbi Shimon disagrees.  Since there is a rule in Jewish law, that one who admits to a crime does not have to pay the fine for having done so, even if this person had admitted to having raped or seduced the daughter, he would not have been obligated to pay the fine.  Therefore, there was no denial of money, and the laws of the oath of deposit do not apply.<br>The Sages respond to Rabbi Shimon that although one who admits to a crime does not have to pay a <b>fine</b>, he does have to <b>pay compensatory damages</b>, which in this case include the payment for embarrassment and the payment for having decreased her value (blemish). Since if he had admitted he would have had to pay, he did deny money, and is therefore liable for having sworn a false oath of deposit.
Introduction<br>Today’s section discusses the mishnah from Shevuot.
In the mishnah from Shevuot, R. Shimon said that if the person falsely denies raping or seducing and then takes an oath and then admits that he was lying, he does not bring a sacrifice because even if he did admit to having raped or seduced he would not be liable to pay the fine. A person is not liable to pay a fine if the only evidence that he committed the crime was his admission.<br>Abaye presents a more complicated scenario. The accusation is not just that he raped or seduced, but that he was convicted and ordered to pay money and the accused denied even having been convicted. The question really is—if a person admits to having been convicted of having to pay a fine, is he obligated to pay that fine. If so, he would have to bring the sacrifice if he denies the crime. Or is he not obligated, just as one who admits to having committed a crime that makes him liable for a fine is not obligated to pay that fine.
Rabbah answers that since he has been tried and convicted, it is a monetary obligation and he must bring a sacrifice for his false oath. What this also means is that if a person admits to having been convicted of owing a fine, he must pay that fine. The idea is that once he was convicted, he has a debt to pay the fine. So he is really admitting to owing a debt. This is different from admitting to having committed a crime for which one owes a fine in the first place, which is really a form of self-incrimination and is therefore not accepted.
Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section Rabbah stated that if person swore that he had not been convicted in court of a crime for which he is liable for a fine, and then he admitted that he had been convicted, he must bring the sacrifice for a false oath. This is because this is not considered admitting to a fine. It is considered admitting to being convicted of owing money for having been convicted of a crime. Today’s section continues to deal with this subject. This is a complicated section, so beware.
This baraita lists several halakhot that are fines 1) Rape or seduction; 2) Killing a slave—the payment is 30 shekels, no matter how much the slave is worth; 3) Knocking out the tooth or putting out the eye of a slave—the slave goes free. Note that in none of these cases is there a quid pro quo evaluation of the damage done. The fine or freedom for the slave is not necessarily equivalent to the damage done. If a person swore falsely that he had not done one of these crimes and then admitted to his false oath he is not liable to bring a sacrifice. This is because these are not like the cases listed in the Torah which are all compensation. For instance if one denies that one took a deposit from someone else and then admits that he did, he owes whatever the value of that deposit is. These are called “compensation” (literally money).

Daf 42b

Abaye here completes his difficulty on Rabbah by assuming that the baraita refers to a case where the person who raped/seduced, killed a slave or knocked out a slave’s tooth or eye had already been tried and convicted. This would reject Rabbah who said in such a case he does bring a sacrifice for swearing falsely.<br>But the Talmud for the moment deflects that criticism and states that the baraita refers more simply to a case where a person had not yet been tried. This was not the case Rabbah was referring to.
The Talmud will now try to use the first clause of the baraita to prove that the entire baraita refers to a case where a person has already stood trial, but at first falsely swears that he has not been convicted and then admits that he has.<br>The baraita refers to three cases: 1) a thief who must pay the double payment, or if he slaughtered or sold the animal, a four or five fold payment; 2) the rapist and seducer; 3) one who falsely claims that his wife was not a virgin.<br>The baraita seems to say that if a person denies any of these debts and then admits to them, he must bring a sacrifice.
The baraita must refer to a case of a person who had already been tried in court because no one is ever liable for the twofold (or fourfold or fivefold) payments until he is convicted in court. If someone simply admits to having stolen, he pays back the principle and no more. And therefore, if the first clause refers to a case where one has been convicted, the second clause must also refer to a similar case.
Rabbah offers here a potential solution that he will reject. R. Shimon holds that when one denies owing a fine and then admits to it, he is obligated to bring a sacrifice. This would allow us to say that the first clause refers to one who had already been tried, but that the second clause refers to one who had not been tried. R. Shimon would then say that if one had already been tried and convicted, and then denied and then admitted, he would bring the sacrifice. In the last clause he would be exempt because he had not yet been convicted.
However, Rabbah admits that this would not be a good resolution because Abaye could respond that if the whole baraita is the opinion of R. Shimon, then why is his name found at the beginning of the second clause (see above). Rather, it seems clear that the first clause is the rabbis and the second clause is R. Shimon. These two positions disagree but they both refer to the same case—where one has been tried and then convicted.
Rabbah now offers his albeit complicated solution to the baraita. First of all, the whole baraita refers to a case where the person had already been tried and convicted and then denied owing the fine. However, the first half is the rabbis and the second half is R. Shimon who would hold that even though he had been tried he still does not bring a sacrifice, because R. Shimon holds that one never brings a sacrifice for denying owing a fine. This is true even if he had already been convicted and then denied being convicted and then admitted it. When Rabbah said that this was compensatory he did not mean that the one who denied and then admitted would be liable to bring a sacrifice. All he meant was that if the father of the girl died after the rapist/seducer had been convicted but before the money had been collected the money goes to the inheritors and not to her. If we had considered it a fine, it would not have been considered part of the father’s estate and when the father is no longer around, the sons would not inherit it. Rather it would go to her as if the father had died before the conviction had occurred.
Introduction<br>Yesterday’s section concluded with Rabbah saying that if the father of the girl died after the rapist/seducer had been convicted but had not yet paid, the money would go to the brothers and not to her. This contradicts, as we shall see, our mishnah.
The mishnah clearly states that if the father dies before collecting the payments from the rapist/seducer, they go to the daughter. They are not bequeathed as an inheritance to the sons. So how can Rabbah have said that they are?
Evidently this difficulty was a thorny one and couldn’t be resolved for twenty-two years, until R. Joseph became head of the yeshiva.  R. Joseph basically said that this was a special case due to a midrash on the word “shall give (ונתן)” found in Deuteronomy 22. If the father does not collect these payments they do not belong to him and when he dies he would not bequeath them to his inheritors. Therefore, Rabbah’s statement that a person bequeaths uncollected fines to his inheritors was only in reference to other fines (such as for killing a slave).
Joseph cited a midrash based on the word “venatan”—the father is not considered to be legal owner of the fines until he takes possession of the money. This distinguished the fine for rape/seduction from other fines. But a word from the same root is used in connection with the fine for accidentally killing a slave. So why would Rabbah say that in that case he does bequeath the uncollected fine to his inheritors and therefore it is considered compensation and not a fine, at least with regard to the obligation to bring a sacrifice for a false oath.<br>The answer is that although the words come from the same root, they are still different roots.
If the fine of rape and seduction is different from all other fines, instead of using the midrash on the word “and he denied” from Leviticus 5, the earlier baraita should have used the midrash on the word “and he shall give” from Deuteronomy 22. This would better allow us to distinguish this fine from all other fines<br>Rava says that we do need the midrash on “and he denied” in connection with the fine for the rapist and the seducer. According to R. Shimon, if she became adolescent (over 12 ½) before the fine was collected, the fines belong to her. If she then dies, her father will inherit these fines even though she has not yet collected them. In this way, this fine is no different from other fines which become “money (compensation)” after the court has convicted the accused. Still, if the rapist/seducer denies owing this money and then admits to it in this case, he will not be liable for a sacrifice.
The earlier baraita had said that the payments for rape, seduction, and killing a slave are all fines. But what we have been saying now is that they are compensation in the case where the person was tried, convicted and then denied owing the money that the court said he owed. So why call them fines and not compensation?<br>Nahman b. Yitzchak emends the baraita to read that these are basically fines, or perhaps more accurately, they are originally fines. They can become “compensation” after conviction. But earlier they are fines.
Introduction<br>This is the last section of this long sugya. As a reminder, according to Rabbah even if the rapist/seducer was convicted and then swore that he does not owe the fine and then admitted to it, he is still not obligated to bring the sacrifice for a false oath because the payment originated in a fine.
Shimon in the mishnah in Shevuot states that if a person admits to owing a fine, he does not pay the fine. But if he had been convicted, denied it and then admitted to having been convicted, clearly R. Shimon would hold that he must pay the fine—after all this is not self-admission, he was convicted. So with this logic in mind, he should also have to bring a sacrifice if he denies owing this money and then admits to it.
Rabbah could explain that R. Shimon is only responding to the view of the other rabbis. To Rabbah, R. Shimon would hold that he is exempt even if he denies the debt after having been convicted. But the rabbis in the mishnah (from Shevuot) should at least agree with him that he does not bring the sacrifice based on a self-admission because one is exempt from paying a fine if the only evidence is his own self-admission.

Daf 43a

The other rabbis say that when the father of the raped or seduced girl demands payment from the man who admitted to the crimes, he is mainly claiming the payments for blame and blemish. Since these are compensation and not fines, the person who swore falsely is liable to bring the sacrifice, even if he admitted to his crime.<br>Note that this interpretation of the rabbis is basically the simple meaning of the mishnah.
In the mishnah R. Shimon views the case as if the father is claiming just the fine, whereas the rabbis say he is claiming just the compensatory payments for shame and blemish. But in reality,  the father is claiming both. So why do they argue with each other?<br>Papa explains that the father is focusing on the fine because the fine is fixed. He knows he will receive fifty shekels. In contrast, the payments for blemish and shame are not fixed, so the father does not know how much he is going to receive.<br>The rabbis say that he is thinking more about the payments for blemish and shame because he knows the man must pay them in all cases. The fine is less certain because the rapist/seducer will not have to pay it if he makes a voluntary admission.
Introduction<br>This week’s daf begins a new topic—does an orphan girl who is being sustained by her brothers (her father’s inheritors) have to give over her handiwork (the proceeds of the work she does) to them, just as she would give over her handiwork to her father when he was providing for her.
On the one hand, her brothers are maintaining her just as her father maintained her. Just as her father received her handiwork, so too her brothers should receive her handiwork. On the other hand, her father maintained her out of his own funds, but her brothers are maintaining her out of her father’s estate. If there is no estate, they do not have to use their own funds to maintain her. Therefore, they might not deserve her handiwork.
Sheshet answers that just as a widow being maintained out of her husband’s estate must give her handiwork to the orphan inheritors, so too should a daughter being maintained from her father’s estate.
The Talmud rejects the comparison. A man may not want his widow both to be sustained and to keep her handiwork. He doesn’t want her to be too well provided for, at the expense of her estate. But he might want his daughter to be well provided for and therefore he might want her to keep her handiwork and be provided for.
The implication of the difficulty raised above is that a man might prefer that his daughter be provided with more sustenance than his widow. This leads to the broader conclusion that a man prefers his own flesh and blood daughter to his widow, whom he may or may not have even chosen to marry. While this makes some logical sense (and I would argue is still often true), it contradicts another baraita. This baraita talks about a case where there is a daughter and either a widow or brothers. We know that in the case of brothers, she is maintained and they must go begging. The rabbis say that the wife is like the daughter—she is guaranteed sustenance and if there is not enough for everyone, the daughter would have to go begging.<br>This baraita seems to demonstrate a preference for the wife—she is guaranteed sustenance whereas the daughter is not.
The resolution is that these are two different issues. When it comes to ensuring that one party does not go begging, a man prefers to make sure that his widow does not have to beg. But when it comes to receiving expansive provisions, i.e. being able to keep one’s handiwork even while being maintained, the daughter is preferred.<br>This seems to me to be an attempt to resolve the difficulty and does not make a lot of logical sense. It is a good example of the Talmud’s desire to resolve difficulties, even if the outcome is not intuitive.
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues to deal with the question of whether a daughter who is being provided for by her father’s inheritors must give them her handiwork. In yesterday’s section R. Sheshet said that she did.
Joseph’s raises an objection from the last clause of the mishnah on daf Mem Aleph.<br>While her father is alive, her handiwork goes to him. Should he not collect her handiwork while he is alive, it is still his and if he dies, his sons inherit it, just as they do any of his uncollected property. The implication is that this is only the handiwork produced while the father was alive. Handiwork produced after his death would remain with the girl, even if she was being maintained. This is difficulty for R. Sheshet.
The resolution is that this mishnah refers to a case where the brothers are not providing for her. In such a case, she does not have to give them her handiwork.<br>The problem though is that this is obvious. A master can say to his Canaanite slave, “work with me and I will not maintain you.” But a master cannot say this to his Hebrew slave. The Hebrew slave is guaranteed maintenance as long as he is working. And all the more so a father could not say this to his daughter, or sons to their father’s daughter. In all of these cases, maintenance is guaranteed.
Rabbah b. Ulla says that the mishnah refers to surplus goods she produces. If she is not being maintained by her brothers, then she may keep her handiwork and use it to feed herself. But if there is surplus, the mishnah would rule that it goes to her brothers. Rabbah would hold that if they are providing for, they receive all of her handiwork. But if they are not providing for her, they only receive the surplus.
Rava says that R. Joseph must have known about the possibility of surplus, and yet he still raised an objection against R. Sheshet. Therefore, Rava will provide a different understanding of R. Joseph’s difficulty.
Rava reinterprets the difficulty that R. Joseph raised on R. Sheshet. The basis of R. Joseph’s difficulty is the mention of anything the girl finds. Findings are collected immediately, whereas handiwork may not be collected immediately (for instance wages). So how can findings be collected later? The mishnah, Rava claims, intends to compare the two. Just as things she finds belong to her father while he is alive and after his death belong to her, so too her handiwork. After his death it belongs to her and not to her brothers, even if they are providing her with maintenance. This is refutation of R. Sheshet.
Introduction<br>This section continues to discuss the topic of who receives a young girl’s handiwork after her father dies.
Rav reiterates that if the daughter is being maintained by her brothers, they do not receive her handiwork. R. Kahana derives this from a verse. The verse says that a father bequeaths “them” as an inheritance to his sons. “Them” refers to his land and by extension his other property. It does not refer to the rights to his daughter’s handiwork. This is not bequeathed to his sons. This disagrees with R. Sheshet from yesterday’s page, but agrees with Rava and R. Joseph.
The verse implies that there are some financial benefits that the father receives from the daughter that her brothers will not receive after their father’s death. But how do we know that this refers to her handiwork, as Rav claimed. Perhaps it refers to other payments, specifically compensation and fine that occurred as the result of seduction, fines and personal injury. When her father is alive, he receives these payments, and when he dies, they go to her. But her handiwork would go to her brothers if they are maintaining her.
The problem with the above interpretation is that the compensation for pain should go to the daughter herself, not to her father. Therefore, R. Yose interprets it as referring to a wound made to her face. In such a case, her father receives at least some of the money because this is an injury to him as well, for he will have more trouble selling her or marrying her off and therefore he would receive the payment for her diminished value. [I realize that this is again troubling. Please remember, selling off one’s daughter was not practiced in rabbinic times. And as far as diminishing his ability to marry her off, this would probably remain true in all societies where parents determine whom their children marry].

Daf 43b

This source is basically the same as above, except here Rav’s halakhah and R. Kahana’s midrashic explanation are woven into one statement.
“Shakud” refers to someone who pays diligent attention to something According to Rashi, Shmuel is called “Shakud” because he paid diligent attention to his halakhic statements, and therefore the halakhah follows him in matters of civil law. In any case, according to Avimi b. Papi, Shmuel agrees—the handiwork goes to the daughter.
The last stage of this discussion is a halakhic debate between some late amoraim. The Nehardeans hold that the law is like R. Sheshet—the handiwork goes to the brothers. But R. Ashi, one of the last amoraim, holds that the law follows Rav—she keeps her own handiwork.
Introduction<br>This mishnah continues to discuss financial rights that a father accrues from his daughter.
<b>Section one:</b>  The daughter was only betrothed and then widowed, betrothed and then widowed again.  The mishnah teaches that since she was never fully married, both ketubot (200 zuz for each marriage) belong to her father.  As long as she is not fully married, he never fully relinquishes control over her.<br><b>Section two:</b>  In this case the daughter is married twice.  According to the first opinion in the mishnah, both ketubot belong to her.  According to this opinion, as soon as she is married, her father loses all control over her, and he cannot make any financial gains through her.  According to Rabbi Judah, the first ketubah belongs to her father, because it was written before the marriage and hence it was a debt incurred while she still lived in her father’s home.  According to the other sages who respond to Rabbi Judah, the collection does not go according to when it was written, but rather her status at the dissolution of the marriage.  Since at this point she was independent, her father has no right to her ketubah.
Curiously, the mishnah describes a situation where she is first divorced and then widowed. Why not say that she was divorced twice or widowed twice? The result would seem to be the same thing.<br>The Talmud reads into this a rule that if a woman is widowed twice she can no longer remarry. This accords with Rabbi Judah Hanasi who says that once that something has happened twice, a “presumption” has been created. She is “presumed” to be a fatal wife, a wife who kills her husbands just by being married to them. The idea of a fatal wife was common in the ancient world, and is even found in the apocryphal work called “Tobit.” There are other passages in the Talmud that deal with this at length. I do not believe that this halakhah is generally still observed, although it was a topic of much discussion in the middle ages.
Introduction<br>In the mishnah we learned yesterday R. Judah says that if a man gives his daughter in marriage and then she is divorced and then he gives her again in marriage and she is widowed, the ketubah from the first marriage goes to the father. In today’s sugya, some amoraim try to explain why.
Rabbah and R. Joseph explain that according to R. Judah, since the ketubah was written before before betrothal, the father receives it should she be divorced from the first marriage. He does not receive the second ketubah for once she was married to the first husband, the father lost his authority over her.
Rava raises a strong objection against Rabbah and R. Joseph’s explanation of R. Judah. In a baraita, R. Judah agrees that if the girl was betrothed while a minor and then became a mature girl (12 ½), and then married the father would not receive the ketubah. This is true even though the ketubah was written while she was still a minor.
The new explanation is that the father receives the ketubah because it was written while she was still in her father’s authority. The Talmud assumes that the ketubah would be written slightly before marriage, as it is today. In the case of the mishnah, she is still not yet a mature girl when she is married, therefore the ketubah is her father’s. But if she reached maturity age before the marriage and before the ketubah was written, then the ketubah would be hers.
The Talmud asks basically when does the ketubah go into effect such that the father or wife would be able to collect from the husband’s encumbered property.<br>Huna divides the minimal ketubah payment of 200 or 100 from any additional amount the husband wishes to give her. The minimal payment goes into effect immediately at betrothal, whether the husband writes the ketubah then or not. The additional payment is contingent upon the marriage proper. The collection date of this additional amount follows, therefore, the date of marriage.<br>Asi says that the date of collection for the entire ketubah follows the date of marriage. While she does collect the ketubah if she is widowed or divorced after betrothal and before marriage, she can collect only from unencumbered property.
Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section R. Huna said that a woman collects the basic part of her ketubah, the 200 or 100 zuz, from encumbered property from the date of the betrothal. The extra money that the husband writes in the ketubah is collectable from encumbered property but only from the date of the marriage. This means that if the husband engages in any loans or sales after betrothal or before marriage, the woman will not be able to collect her 100 zuz from that property.
The Talmud will construe a contradiction between R. Huna’s earlier ruling and the following one. If a woman has two ketubot, one larger and one smaller, she can collect the smaller one from encumbered property from the earlier of the two dates, but the larger one only from the later date. This is because we know that only one of the two ketubot is valid and that at least two hundred zuz were owed from the first date. But we cannot know if the larger ketubah was valid from the earlier date, and therefore if she wants to collect the larger ketubah, it is only from the latter date.
If R. Huna had said that she can collect the main part of the ketubah from the date of betrothal, and the additional part from the date of marriage, then why can’t we look at the case of the large and small ketubah as if it was the same. She could get the 200 from the earlier date and the other 100 from the later date. Why should she sacrifice the extra 100 just because she wants to be able to collect the 200 from encumbered property from the earlier date?
The Talmud asks a rhetorical question—why should she not receive the full five hundred. Why don’t we imagine that he first wrote her a ketubah of 200 and then added another ketubah of 300, such that she should collect 500?<br>The answer is that that he did not write this in the correct language of adding on to an existing amount. Rather he implied that what he wanted was to give her two options—if she wanted to collect from the earlier time, she could collect the two hundred zuz, but if she wants to wait and collect encumbered property from the later time, she can get 300.<br>The same would be true if he wrote her a ketubah with one amount, 300 zuz. By accepting the larger ketubah, she forgoes the lien that was created at betrothal in the amount of 200. She can collect the full amount but only from marriage.<br>This is different from an addition to the ketubah discussed by R. Huna. There he does write “and I added on.” Therefore, she can collect the basic amount from encumbered property from the time of betrothal. The additional amount she collects from encumbered property only from the point of marriage but she does not forgo her lien on the basic amount.

Daf 44a

Introduction<br>At the end of last week’s daf, there was a source according to which a woman with two ketubot could choose which one she wants to use to collect. This week’s daf opens by questioning that possibility.
Above, the Talmud assumed she could collect from whichever ketubah she wished. This contradicts R. Nahman who says that if two of the same document are written, one after the other, the latter cancels out the former. The assumption would seem to be that when he wrote the latter, he intended it to override the earlier document. This would have been done so that the lien was created at a later date, and the creditor would be able to seize only the property owned by the debtor at the later date.
The resolution is that the newer document overrides the older one only if he did not add anything in. If he did add something in, then he intended to add the addition and not override the older document. The ramification of this is that if the person wants to collect with the older document, which has an older lien on it, he can do so, but not the extra palm (or whatever is extra). If he wants to collect the addition, then he can but only with a lien from a later time.Introduction
Today’s section discusses R. Nahman’s statement from yesterday’s sugya, that if there are two of the same document, the second one overrides the first.
This is all material from yesterday’s sugya. R. Papa says that if the person added something into the second document, then he did not intend to annul the first document. The ramification of this is that if the person wants to collect with the older document, which has an earlier lien on it, he can do so, but not the extra palm (or whatever is extra). If he wants to collect the addition, then he can but only with a lien from a later time.
If both deeds are the same except the first is a sale and the second is a present, we can assume that what he wanted to do was avoid the law of pre-emption. According to this law, if a person sells a piece of land, another person who has a piece of land next to that land, has first rights to purchase the land. If I want to avoid this law, I can just give the land to someone else. The laws of pre-emption do not apply to gifts.
If the first document was a gift and the second a sale, then we can also assume that he changed the document to protect the rights of the purchaser. Once he bought the land, if a creditor comes and takes the land from him, he can go back to the original seller and claim compensation.
If both deeds are the same, then why do we assume that the second cancels out the first.<br>Rafram said that we can assume that the one who received the deed admitted that the first was invalid.<br>Aha says that we can assume that the person holding the deed had forgiven the lien created by the first deed. That is why we allow him to collect only from the date of the second document.
The Talmud asks that the practical difference between the opinion of Rafram and R. Aha—after all they both agree that the second document is valid and not the first.<br>There are three cases in which they differ:<br>According to Rafram, the witnesses that signed on the first document are invalid for having signed on an invalid document.<br>According to Rafram, if the receiver had eaten the fruits of the field between the time on the first document and the time on the second document, he must pay them back.<br>According to Rafram, the seller must pay the taxes on the field that accrued between the time of the first document and that of the second.<br>To put this another way, according to Rafram, the sale/gift is really only valid from the date of the second document. The first document is totally invalid. According to R. Aha, the sale may have been valid from the earlier time, but the lien exists only from the second date. So except for the issue of the lien, the sale is valid from the first document.
Introduction<br>Today’s section returns to discuss the situation of a woman or her father coming to collect a ketubah. Do they collect based on the date of the betrothal or based on the date of the marriage? The ramification is with regard to when the lien is created on the husband’s property.
This dispute is identical to the dispute on daf 43.<br>Judah divides the minimal ketubah payment of 200 or 100 from any additional amount the husband wishes to give her. The minimal payment goes into effect immediately at betrothal, whether the husband writes the ketubah then or not. The additional payment is contingent upon the marriage proper. The collection date of this additional amount follows, therefore, the date of marriage.<br>The other sages says that the date of collection for the entire ketubah follows the date of marriage. While she does collect the ketubah if she is widowed or divorced after betrothal and before marriage, she can collect only from unencumbered property.
Introduction<br>Deuteronomy 22:13-21 discusses a man who makes a virginity claim against his wife.  Verse 19 states that if he was found to be lying “They shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver and give it to the girl’s father; for the man has defamed a virgin in Israel.”  Verses 20-21 state that if the claim was found to be true, then the woman is stoned.  Verses 22-23 deal with a betrothed woman who commits adultery, who is also stoned.  From the phrase “a virgin in Israel”, our mishnah derives that the punishment of stoning is meted out in both of these cases only if the woman was a born Israelite.  If she was a convert, then she is punished by strangulation, as are other adulterers.
The mishnah lists three types of women who have committed an act of fornication, i.e. adultery.  The first is a woman who has converted with her mother, the second is one whose mother converted between conception and birth, and third is one whose mother converted before conception.  Each woman/girl has slightly different consequences to her crime.
<b>Section one:</b> Since this girl is herself a convert she does not count as a “virgin of Israel”.  Therefore, if she commits adultery, she is punished by strangulation, the typical punishment for adultery.  Deuteronomy 22:21 states that if the charge of not being a virgin was true, “then the girl shall be brought out to the entrance of her father’s house, and the men of her town shall stone her to death.”  Since this girl was not a “virgin of Israel”, she is not brought out to the entrance to her father’s house.  If the husband’s claim against her was false he need not pay the 100 sela [=shekel] fine, for she was not a “virgin of Israel”.<br><b>Section two:</b> In this case the girl was conceived in unholiness, meaning her mother was not an Israelite when she was conceived. However, the mother converted before the birth and therefore she was born “in holiness”. In this case she is stoned if she commits adultery while a betrothed virgin.  However, she does not get taken out to the entrance of her father’s house nor is her husband fined 100 shekels if he made a false claim against her. In other words she is in some ways treated like a full Israelite and in other ways she is not.<br><b>Section three:</b> Although this girl’s mother is a convert, she herself is considered a full Israelite.<br><b>Section four:</b>  This section teaches that if a girl has no father, or has a father but her father’s house doesn’t have a house with an entrance (for instance he is homeless), she is still liable to be stoned should she commit an act of fornication while betrothed.  When the Torah states that she shall be taken out to the entrance of her father’s house, the intention was not that if she didn’t have a father with a house with an entrance, that she would not receive the prescribed penalty. Rather the intention was that if she should commit such an act of fornication, she should be stoned at the entrance to her father’s house, if such a place exists.  In other words, its lack of existence does not impede upon the carrying out of the other elements to the passage in Deuteronomy.

Daf 44b

Introduction<br>Today’s section begins to explain the mishnah.
In the mishnah we learned that if her mother converted after becoming pregnant but before giving birth the girl is executed by stoning as are all Israelite girls. But how do we know this? Resh Lakish says that it is derived from the word, “that she die”—taken from the phrase “and they will stone her that she die.” This is an extraneous word—obviously she is to die from the stoning. So we use this word for a midrash that even though she was conceived “not in holiness,” she is still executed by stoning.
If we use this midrash to say that this girl is treated like an Israelite girl, then why does the mishnah say that her husband is not flogged and forced to pay the 100 sela fine for libeling her, as he would be if she was a regular Israelite girl.<br>The answer is that the midrash includes only her, that she is executed the way an Israelite girl. But it does not mean that she is counted as full Israelite girl for every issue. It does not include him.
Why do we say that the midrash includes a girl who was conceived not in holiness, but born in holiness, meaning her mother converted during pregnancy? Why not say that it includes a girl conceived and born in holiness, meaning her mother converted before birth?<br>The answer is that such a girl counts as a full Israelite girl.<br>I should note that we should not take any of this for granted. What we “know” to be true—that the child of a convert is a Jew—was probably still being worked out in the Talmudic period. Similarly, while we “know” that a convert is a full Jew, this too was still being partially worked out in the Talmudic period.
Why not say that even one conceived and born in unholiness is executed by stoning? The answer is that this would leave us without any need for the word “in Israel.” Clearly the laws refer only to a Jew. So the word “in Israel” must add some new information. What it adds is that these laws apply only to one “born in holiness”—meaning born as a Jew.
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues to discuss the laws of a man who accuses his wife of not being a virgin at their wedding.
Yose b. Hanina takes the wording of the Torah literally. A man who falsely claims that his orphan wife was not a virgin does not have to pay the fine, because she has no father, and the Torah prescribes giving the money to the father. No father, no fine.
An amora raises a difficulty from a baraita which uses the doubling of the word “refuse” to conclude that the laws of fines apply even to girls without fathers, despite the fact that the Torah consistently describes these girls as having fathers. This baraita seems to rule against R. Yose b. Hanina’s halakhah.
Yose b. Avin solves his own difficulty. If the girl had a father when the man (the seducer/rapist) had intercourse with her, then he is liable to pay the fine. But R. Yose b. Hanina was referring to a case where the girl was already an orphan by the time they consummated their marriage.
Rava says that a man who makes a claim about an Israelite girl without a father is liable. According to the Talmud he learns this from the fact that a baraita taught by Ammi rules that if a man makes a false virginity claim against his wife who is a convert, he is exempt. A convert is considered to be like a newborn, without any parents. Therefore, Rava could argue, that since a man who makes a claim against an Israelite without a father is obligated, we needed a baraita to teach that if he makes such a claim against a convert, he is exempt. But if a man who made a complaint against an Israelite girl without a father was exempt, then it would have been obvious that had he made the claim against a convert, he is exempt. We would not then have needed this baraita. The existence of this baraita proves that if she was an Israelite he is liable, even if she does not have a father.
According to Resh Lakish the Torah’s use of the word “young girl” is meant to be precise—the law applies only to a girl between the ages of 12 and 12.5 (or for six months from the time she begins puberty). If he makes a false claim against a younger girl, he is exempt. Like R. Yose b. Hanina, Resh Lakish reads the Torah very literally.
Aha b. Abba points out that in the continuation of the verses in Deuteronomy, if it turns out she really was not a virgin, she is stoned. Now this cannot refer to a minor, because minors are never punished since they are below the age of legal culpability. Therefore, we would know that this entire chapter cannot refer to a minor even if the Torah had not used the word “na’arah.”<br>So from here, R. Aha b. Abba learns that whenever the Torah uses a defective spelling of the word for young girl, writing it נער instead of נערה, as it does in this case, the intent is to refer also to minor and not just a na’arah, a young girl.<br>To put this another way, since we know that the chapter refers only to a na’arah and not a minor, we must ask why the Torah uses the word. We learn that the defective spelling refers to both a young girl and a minor. In this case, the word itself as used in Deuteronomy 22 could mean both. But since the Torah refers to her punishment, the whole chapter must refer only to a young girl, a na’arah, and not a minor.
Introduction<br>Deuteronomy 22 refers to adultery committed in various stages of a woman being betrothed or married. In some cases the woman is stoned and in other cases the Torah says she is executed but does not mention how. Also, the stoning takes place at different locations.<br>In this section a sage named Shila claims that a “na’arah” a young girl between the ages of 12 and 12.5 could potentially be subjected to any of these forms of execution.<br>I should again emphasize that these are theoretical discussions concerned with interpreting the Torah and not with legislating real life situations. Rabbis were not executing people for any crimes in this period, and probably not in any other as well.
If the witnesses come after she has already been married and testify that she committed adultery when betrothed and still living in her father’s house, she is stoned at her father’s house. This is the case referred to in Deuteronomy 22:21 (the simple reading of the passage is that she was not a virgin at her wedding). The reason to stone her at her father’s house is symbolic—as if to say to him, look what you have raised in your house.

Daf 45a

If the witnesses come to testify against her while she is still betrothed, that she committed adultery as a betrothed girl, she is stoned at the gates of the city. This is referred to in Deuteronomy 22:24. It is not entirely clear why she should be stoned at the gates of the city if she committed adultery in her father’s house, as was the girl in the above clause. Shila could answer, I suppose, that since we probably know in this case who her paramour is, and he is being executed as well, then they both should be executed in the same place, at the gates of the city.
Deuteronomy 22:22 refers to adultery with a married woman. The Torah does not specify how she is executed. The rabbis generally hold that whenever the Torah does not specify a mode of execution, the criminal is to be executed by strangulation. They considered this the “best” form of execution, not because it was the least painful, but because it left the least damage to the body.<br>Shila adds that this form of execution would also be meted out to a betrothed young girl who became of majority age after she committed adultery but before she could be convicted. The Torah consistently uses the word “na’arah,” a young girl, when referring to a girl who is to be stoned. If the girl is no longer a “na’arah” she is executed in the default manner, by strangulation.
Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section we learned that if the girl committed adultery as a na’arah (a young girl) but then reached majority age before being tried, she is executed by strangulation and not stoning, as she would have been had she been tried as a young girl. Thus when her body changes by getting older her mode of execution changes. Our section questions this assumption.
This source refers to the laws of a husband who says his wife was not a virgin at the time of marriage (Deuteronomy 22). If she was betrothed as a young girl but then married only when she has reached majority age, the husband is not punished for libeling her by being lashed or having to pay 100 selas.<br>If there are witnesses who testify that she fornicated after betrothal, if they are telling the truth, she is executed by stoning, and if they are not telling the truth, then they are executed by stoning.<br>This baraita proves that even though the witnesses testify against her only after she has reached majority age, she is still executed by stoning, since she committed adultery while she was still a na’arah, a young girl.
Rava says that one cannot use the case of a husband “bringing out an evil name” as a precedent for other situations of adultery. As a reminder, the rabbis read this chapter as a case where the woman committed adultery (and not that she had pre-marital sex). Rava points out that this case is different from other cases of adultery. In normal cases, once a woman enters the bridal chamber (the huppah, which in those days was a real room), she is legally considered to be married, even if she has not yet had intercourse. If she commits adultery after entering the bridal chamber but before having sex with her husband, she is executed by strangulation, not by stoning, as she would have been had she committed adultery while betrothed. However, in the case of a husband who brings out a bad name against a woman who has entered the bridal chamber but not yet had sex, claiming that she committed adultery, she is still stoned.<br>Rava argues that since the laws of the husband who brings out an evil name are different, they cannot be used to prove that in other cases if her body changes, i.e. she grows older, she still receives the same punishment.
Huna argues against Rava. It is possible that the laws of a husband bearing an evil name are anomalous only when she remained a young girl. In this case, she is still stoned, even though she already entered huppah, a difference from the laws governing a normal situation. But perhaps if she did change, meaning by the time she was tried she was of majority age, she would be punished by strangulation.<br>If this is so, then we could return to Shila’s ruling that if she reaches majority age before being convicted, she is executed by strangulation and not stoning.
Introduction<br>Our section continues to discuss whether a girl who fornicated while a na’arah (12-12.5) and therefore should be executed according to the Torah by stoning, but who was convicted only after she reaches majority age, is still executed by stoning or whether her mode of execution changes to strangulation, the execution for a girl who was of majority age when she committed adultery.
Nahman b. Yitzchak says that there is a tannaitic dispute over whether the punishment changes when the body changes. He quotes a mishnah from Horayot (3:3). According to this mishnah, if a high priest or chieftain issued an errant ruling before they were appointed, they are not liable to bring the special sin offering obligatory upon high priests or chieftains, since at the time of the ruling they were regular individuals. In other words, their liability is dependent upon the time of the ruling. In this case, if they transgressed they are liable to bring the same sin-offering as would a regular Israelite.<br>Rabbi Shimon holds that if they found out they had erred before their appointment they are liable to bring a sin offering as would a regular Israelite.  However, if they found out about their sin after they were appointed, they are completely exempt.  Rabbi Shimon holds that their liability is dependent both upon the timing of the errant ruling and the realization that it was errant.<br>Nahman b. Yitzchak equates this Mishnah with the situation about the girl who fornicated. In both cases, some status changed after the sin, and this change in status changes the punishment, according to R. Shimon. According to the first opinion, it does not.

Daf 45b

The Talmud critiques R. Nahman b. Yitzchak’s equation. No one holds that the fact that R. Shimon does not make a person who only finds out about his error after he is appointed priest or king liable to bring the special offering implies that the sacrifice <b>changes</b> because of a change in the person’s status. Rather, he says they are <b>completely</b> <b>exempt</b> because the realization of the sin and the sin itself must occur both with the same status. This is different from the case of the girl who fornicated when she was a young girl and then became of majority age. In such a case, R. Shimon might say that the punishment changes.
If it were true that R. Shimon held that the sacrifice simply changed when their status changed, then the High Priest would have to bring a bull and the chief a he-goat. But in fact, he says that they do not bring any sacrifice whatsoever. Thus the comparison between R. Shimon and Shila is refuted.
This section changes Shila’s ruling—if she commits adultery as a young girl and then is convicted only as a girl of majority age, she is still stoned because she committed the crime as a na’arah.<br>Ila says that when the verse calls her a na’arah, it implies that she was a na’arah at the time of the transgression, but not necessarily at the time of conviction.
Hanania says that if the girl is still punished by being stoned, since she was a na’arah when she fornicated, then the husband should also be punished if he falsely libels her for fornicating when she was a young girl. In other words, there is a logical inconsistency with R. Ila’s (and R. Yohanan’s) ruling.<br>Ila responds with an attack on R. Hanania, and R. Hanania responds with a counterattack. This type of argument does not really get us very far.<br>Yitzchak b. Avin explains why there should be a difference between her and him. Basically, when she transgressed, she was a na’arah, so she should get the punishment fitting for a na’arah. But when he transgressed, she was no longer a na’arah. She had reached majority age. Therefore, he is not punished with the punishments he would get if she had been a na’arah at the time of his false accusation.<br>In other words, R. Elai finds reads the Torah very literally. Even if the law is not particularly logical, to him this is what the Torah says.
Introduction<br>According to Deuteronomy 22:21, a young girl who commits adultery is stoned at the “door of her father’s house.” Today’s section talks about what happens if the girl does not have a “door of her father’s house.” Where is she stoned?
If she has no “door to her father’s house” then she is still stoned, but the stoning takes place at the door to the city gates. This is the setting of the stoning in v. 24.<br>However, if the city is mostly non-Jews, then the site of the stoning is moved to the Jewish court. It seems that it would be destructive to the Jewish community to have her stoned in the public gates if the majority of the city was not Jewish.
The same change of site of stoning exists with regard to one who is being punished for worshipping idols. He too is not stoned at the gates of the city if the city is mostly idolaters.
The first part of this baraita proves that an Israelite who worships idols is stoned at the gate where he worshipped. The phrase “your gates” in Deuteronomy 17:5 is unclear and could refer either to the gates where he worshipped idols or to the gates where he was tried. But in 17:2, the phrase “your gates” clearly refers to the gates where he worshipped. Therefore, 17:5 must also refer to the gates where he worshipped idols. Note that this does not agree with the baraita above.
The second part of the baraita uses the word “your gates” to exclude the gates of non-Jews—one does not stone a Jew at the gates of non-Jews.<br>The Talmud says that since the word is plural, two halakhot can be deduced from it: 1) The gates where the person worshipped idols; 2) Not the gates of idolaters.
Abbahu derives that a betrothed girl is not stoned at the gates of a city whose majority is non-Jewish from a chain of linguistic connection. The word “door” from Deuteronomy 22:21 connects with “door” from Numbers 4:26. This “door” is connected to “gate” and this “gate” connects us back to “your gates”—not the gates of a city whose majority is non-Jews.
Introduction<br>Our sugya deals with the laws of a husband who libels his wife. Again, I wish to remind the reader that in the eyes of the rabbis this parsha refers to a husband who accuses his wife of having committed adultery after betrothal but before marriage.
The Torah says that a husband who falsely accuses his wife is flogged and pays a 100 sela fine to the father of his wife. According to the first opinion, he pays and is flogged under any circumstance, even if he did not have intercourse with her. Note that this is far removed from the simple reading of the source, according to which he is accusing her of not being a virgin. Such a complaint makes sense only after he has had sex with her. But if his complaint is that she committed adultery, then it really does not matter whether they had sex or not.<br>According to R. Judah, he is flogged under any circumstance, whether or not they had sex. But he pays the fine only if they had sex.
On daf 46 the Talmud will cite a disagreement between the rabbis and R. Eliezer b. Jacob. The rabbis hold that the halakhot concerning a husband who brings out an evil name against his wife refers both to a case where they had intercourse, or one where they did not. This accords with the first opinion here. R. Judah is in agreement with R. Eliezer b. Jacob, who holds that the chapter refers to a case where they had intercourse. Thus he pays only if he had intercourse. But, he is flogged under any circumstance, because he violated the prohibition of slandering another person.
Introduction<br>In yesterday’s section the Talmud proposed that only R. Judah agrees with R. Eliezer b. Jacob who said that the chapter concerning the husband who libels his wife refers only to a case where they had sex. Therefore the husband pays the fine only if he had sex. The Talmud had said that the other rabbis, who hold that the husband pays the fine no matter what, agreed with the other rabbis who disagreed with R. Eliezer b. Jacob. Today’s section attempts to say that everyone agrees with R. Eliezer b. Jacob.
This version of the debate in the earlier baraita completely changes the reading of the first opinion. Whereas earlier we thought that according to this opinion, the husband is flogged and pays the fine whether or not he had sex with his wife, it now reads that he is flogged and pays the fine only if he did have sex. This opinion now completely accords with R. Eliezer b Jacob. R. Judah says he is flogged in any case, even if he did not have sex, because he violated the prohibition against libeling someone. But he agrees with R. Eliezer b. Jacob that since he did not have sex, he is not libel for the 100 sela.
We have now another baraita according to which R. Judah says that he is flogged even if they did not have sex. This disagrees with the version of the baraita taught above and in yesterday’s section.
Two amoraim attempt to resolve the two contradictory baraitot. According to R. Nahman b. Yitzchak, in the second baraita, when R. Judah says that the husband is flogged, he does not mean that the Torah dictates that he is flogged. His lashes are for transgressing the rabbis, who clearly do not want a husband to be falsely libeling his wife. But he does not receive lashes from Torah law, for the Torah refers only to a case where they already had sex.<br>Papa said that the word “he is flogged” does not really mean that he is flogged. It means that he pays the fine.

Daf 46a

The Talmud finds a precedent where the word “flogged” is understand as paying a fine. If a person dedicates half of his value to the Temple, R. Judah says that he must pay the full value and he is flogged. R. Papa explains that he is not really flogged, rather he is “flogged” by having to pay his full value. The Talmud explains that a person who dedicates half of his value really should only have to pay half of his value. But we make him pay his full value lest he state that he is dedicating the value of half of his body to the Temple. Now the value of “half of one’s body” is equivalent to the value of one’s full body—if you lose half your body, you die. Lest people think that one who dedicates half of the value of one’s body only has to pay half of the value of his body, R. Judah declared that even if he dedicates half of one’s value, he pays the full value.<br>In any case, the essential issue here is that when they use the word “flog” they do not necessarily mean it literally. It can be understood as referring to paying a fine. 
Introduction<br>The first half of this week’s daf continues to deal with the chapter concerning a husband who brings out a bad name against his wife. The second half of the daf will move to a new topic, one that finally discusses the typical laws of marriage.
This source explains how we know that the husband who libels his wife must pay a fine and be flogged. The fine is mentioned explicitly in the Torah, but the fact that he is flogged must be derived from a complicated linguistic connection. First the word “shall chastise” connects this chapter with the chapter about the rebellious son (Deuteronomy 21:18). This chapter uses the word “son” which connects us with Deuteronomy 25:2. Since that chapter refers to flogging, we can interpret “shall chastise” in our chapter as referring to flogging as well.
In this section two amoraim locate where we could read into the Torah that a husband is warned not to bring out a bad name about his wife. The idea is that a person cannot be punished unless the Torah first warns him not to commit a particular transgression.
The Talmud now asks the question it often does when amoraim dispute which verse is used to derive a particular prohibition—why did each amora not use the other verse.<br>Elazar did not use the verse “and you shall keep yourself from every evil thing” because he uses that verse as does R. Pinchas b. Yair. They read the verse as warning a person not to think sexual thoughts at night, which would lead to a nocturnal emission. The next verse in Deuteronomy (23:11) actually discusses nocturnal emissions, which leads to this reading of the verse.<br>I should note that the rabbis took “spilling of seed” very seriously. I am not going to comment here on whether or not this strict anti-masturbation attitude has been proven to be a viable prohibition, or a healthy one.
Natan does not use the text used by R. Elazar because he reads the word רכיל as a pun on the word רך, which means “soft” or “lenient”. The court should not be lenient with one litigant and harsh one another. We should note that while this reading is not the “simple” meaning of the verse, it does accord with the context in which this verse is stated in Leviticus 19. The previous verse talks about perversion of justice. This leads to the interpretation that this verse should also refer to matters of justice. In fact, even modern biblical scholars have tried to come up with an interpretation of the verse that is connected with legal issues.
Introduction<br>Today’s section continues to discuss the scenario of a husband who libels his wife.
If the husband falsely accuses his wife of having committed adultery after betrothal and summons witnesses to falsely testify on his behalf, then he is lashed and fined. But if the witnesses come on their own and falsely testify that she committed adultery, the husband is not punished with the lashes or the fine.<br>If the witnesses turn out to be false witnesses, they receive the punishment that they tried to mete out on her, stoning. But if they are telling the truth, then she is executed.
According to the baraita at the beginning of the page, the husband is liable for lashes and financial penalty as long as he tells the witnesses to falsely testify that his wife committed adultery. But R. Judah holds that he must hire the witnesses, i.e. pay them, in order to be liable. If he merely tells them to falsely testify, they and not he are liable.
Abbahu explains that R. Judah derives the rule that the husband must hire witnesses in order for him to be liable from the use of the word “to place.” In Deuteronomy the husband “places” on his wife a false claim, and from the use of the same word in Exodus we can know that the verb “place” refers to use of money. Thus in order for the husband to be liable, he must hire false witnesses.<br>The same midrash is then stated by a few more amoraim.
Yirmiyah now asks some follow-up questions about the husband’s liability. We might think that since R. Judah derives the law from the context in Exodus which deals with money and not land, that if the husband hires them with land, he is exempt.<br>A perutah is the smallest coin. So if the husband hires them for less than this amount, does this count as hiring them for money?<br>And if we say that the hiring has to be for a perutah, does that mean a perutah for each person or is one perutah sufficient for both witnesses?<br>The Talmud will not answer these two questions.
Ashi asks about a husband who marries a woman whom he married, divorced and then remarried. Now, after they are married for the second time, he goes back and says that she was not a virgin the first time he married her.<br>He also asks about a woman whose husband died while she was still betrothed. Can the yavam, the dead husband’s brother, make a claim when he marries her that she had committed adultery after betrothal?
Only one of the questions, the final one is answered. When the father defends his daughter against the claims of the husband he says, “I gave my daughter to this man.” This implies that only “this man” the original husband, can be liable for the false claim. Should the levir, the dead husband’s brother, make a false claim, he would not be liable.
Introduction<br>On 45b the Talmud mentioned a dispute between R. Eliezer b. Ya’akov and the rabbis as to whether the husband is punished for libeling his wife even if he never had relations with her.<br>I should reiterate the transformation that this passage has undergone from its simple meaning in the Torah to its rabbinic interpretation. According to the simple reading of the Torah, the husband has sex with his wife and then falsely claims that she was not a virgin when he married her. The parents of the bride bring a bloody sheet that proves that she was a virgin and the husband is punished as a result. If they do not prove her virginity, she is stoned.<br>To the rabbis (or at least the dominant interpretation) the husband claims that she committed adultery after betrothal and he brings witnesses that saw her do so. If these witnesses are lying, then he is punished and they are stoned. If he is telling the truth, then she is stoned for adultery.<br>In the simple reading of the Torah, it is obvious that the husband had sex with her. That is how he knows, or at least claims to know, that she is not a virgin. But according to the rabbinic interpretation, there does not seem to be any reason for him to have to have sex with her. The evidence relies on witnesses.<br>Today’s section deals, in essence, with the dissonance between the simple reading of the Torah, and the rabbinic reading.
The baraita begins by simply explaining the rabbinic understanding of the passage. The man comes to the court and claims that he did not find his wife to be a virgin. But what does this mean? It does not mean, as we would have thought, that they had sex and he simply thought she was not a virgin. Rather, it means that there were witnesses that she had relations with another man after betrothal.<br>If it turns out she committed adultery after betrothal, she is an adulteress and she is to be stoned. If, however, witnesses testify that she had sex before betrothal, then all she has done is lie to her husband, telling him that she was a virgin when she was not. At worst, she loses the 200 shekel ketubah of a virgin and receives only the 100 shekel ketubah.
If the husband was lying, then he is flogged and pays the fine. Now we see the dispute between the first interpretation and R. Eliezer b. Ya’akov. According to the anonymous opinion (“the rabbis”), it does not matter whether he did or not. According to R. Eliezer BY he is liable only if he had sex with her. The Talmud will now ask a series of questions as to how the anonymous opinion can accord with the verses of the Torah.
The Torah seems to explicitly say that he had relations with her. R. Eliezer b. Ya’akov can easily interpret these words, but how do the rabbis interpret them.<br>The rabbis read these words metaphorically.<br>We should note that despite the fact that the words might seem to us metaphorical, these are simply euphemisms for sex, just as we use the word “sleep.” We know that to sleep with a person is not the same as to sleep with a pillow. The rabbis knew that “he came upon her” means that he had sex with her.
The husband claims that he did not find his wife to be a virgin—again, it seems quite clear that he had sex with her. So how do the other rabbis interpret this verse?<br>Again, they interpret it in line with their dominant interpretation—the husband says that he did not find witnesses who could testify against the witnesses who claimed that she committed adultery.
According to the simple reading, which accords with R. Eliezer b. Ya’akov, the parents defend their daughter by showing her virginity. The rabbis must again interpret this in connection with their interpretation. They produce witnesses who testify to her virginity.
Finally, the rabbis have trouble with the reference to the sheet. Again, this seems to clearly refer to the parents showing a sheet with blood on it, proving that the husband had sex with her.<br>Abbahu explains that the rabbis read the word ופרשו not as “spread out” but as “explain” a word pronounced differently but spelled the same. The rabbis clarify the matter so that it is as clear, i.e. as white, as a new garment. But R. Eliezer BY insists that the words be taken literally.
Introduction<br>This is the final section dealing the chapter about the husband who libels his wife. Just a warning, this section a bit graphic.
Natural intercourse is vaginal intercourse and unnatural intercourse is anal intercourse. Generally speaking unnatural intercourse counts as intercourse with regard to all punishments. For instance, if a man has unnatural intercourse with a married woman, the two are both adulterers. However, in the case of the man who brings out an evil report about his wife, it doesn’t matter if he had unnatural intercourse and then claims that his wife was not a virgin because she committed adultery through natural intercourse.<br>This interpretation is in essence in line with the rabbinic interpretation of the chapter. There is no connection between what the husband does (i.e. whether and what type of intercourse he has with her) and his claim, she committed adultery. However, since, when he accuses her of adultery, he says, “I did not find her to be a virgin,” R. Yohanan interprets the accusation of being related to the usual understanding of virginity—one who has not had natural intercourse.

Daf 46b

The problem is that R. Yohanan’s rule does not accord perfectly with either R. Eliezer ben Ya’akov who says that the husband is punished only if he has sex with her, such that his claim that she is not a virgin is based on his experience, or with the rabbis who hold that he need not have sex with her at all.<br>To fix this, the Talmud emends the statement such that it basically agrees completely with R. Eliezer b. Ya’akov. The husband must have natural intercourse and then claim that she committed adultery by having natural intercourse with another man.
Introduction<br>This mishnah delineates basic rights that a father has over his daughter and that a husband has over his wife.  In addition the mishnah outlines basic responsibilities that a husband has to his wife.  We can easily see from this mishnah that the society that the Mishnah envisions/reflects is patriarchal.  The father/husband is head of the household.  Most of the earnings of the members of the household belong to him and he has the responsibility for providing for them.
<br><b>Section one:</b>  According to the first mishnah in tractate Kiddushin there are three means by which to effect betrothal:  money, document or intercourse.  Our mishnah teaches that a father has the right to accept money or document on behalf of his daughter in order that she should be betrothed.  He also has the right to give her to a man with whom she will have intercourse and thereby become betrothed.  This right is limited to a girl who has not yet reached majority age (typically 12 ½).  After that the girl receives her own betrothal.<br><b>Section two:</b>  Any money a daughter might earn belongs to her father.  This includes things she might find and her handiwork (for instance weaving, sewing, work in the field, etc.).  In addition the father has a right to annul her vows (see Numbers 30:6).  The reason that annulling vows is listed in this clause is that it is in essence an economic right since a vow could prevent him from having her handiwork.  For instance if she took a vow that any thing she finds is forbidden to her father, she would thereby deny him of one of his economic rights.<br><b>Section three:</b>  If the father betroths his daughter and then the husband decides to divorce her before fully marrying her, the father receives the get.  However, if the girl was married, the father no longer has any domain over her.  If the girl should come into money while still in her father’s house, the principal belongs to her as well as the interest (the usufruct).  However, if she dies, her father inherits both the principal and the usufruct.  The normal way that a girl would come into money that does not automatically belong to her father is by inheriting her mother’s father.  This would happen if her mother died before her grandfather died (for if her grandfather died first when her mother died her husband would inherit her) and her mother was an inheritor (i.e. her grandfather had no sons).  In such a case she would inherit her grandfather.<br><b>Section four:</b>  A husband has more rights than the father in that the husband does have right to the usufruct from his wife’s property during her lifetime.  This could happen if she received an inheritance after the marriage.  If she should die before her husband dies then he would inherit the principal as well, but if the husband would die first he would never own the principal.  The husband also has rights over whatever his wife finds and whatever money she earns.  He also can annul her vows.<br><b>Section five:</b>  The mishnah now begins to list the husband’s responsibilities towards his wife.  The primary responsibility is to provide food.  He also must provide her with clothing and shelter.  If she is taken captive he must pay a ransom in order to redeem her.  From the very fact that this is listed as a basic responsibility of the husband to his wife clearly demonstrates that kidnapping must have been a serious problem.<br>The husband is also responsible to pay for his wife’s burial.  According to Rabbi Judah, even if the husband is poor he must provide two flutes and one lamenting-woman for the funeral.
The Talmud now begins to ask how we know that the father receives the money through which she is betrothed. Rav Judah answers with a midrash of a verse concerning a young girl who is sold into slavery. When this girl reaches a certain age, the master or his son is to marry her. If he does not, he must send her free, without the usual money used to redeem a slave. The Torah emphasizes this—“she goes out for nothing, without money.” The repetition allows Rav Judah to offer a midrash—there is no money when a girl leaves her master’s domain in this case. But in another similar case, when a girl leaves her father’s domain by being betrothed, there is money. And who receives the money—her father....
Judah’s midrash successfully proved that there is money when the girl leaves her father’s domain. But how do we know the father receives it? Maybe the girl who is being betrothed should receive it?<br>The answer is that if the father has the right to betroth her, i.e. to decide to whom she is betrothed, then shouldn’t he be the one to receive the money.
Above we said that since a father decides whom his daughter marries, he should receive the betrothal money. But a na’arah, a girl between the ages of 12 to 12.5 can decide herself to whom she is betrothed. So she should be able to receive her betrothal money, not her father.  But we know that the father does receive the money. So again the question is asked, how do we know this?
The Talmud now answers with a verse taken from the context of the annulment of vows. The verse implies, to the Talmud, that all financial advantage that comes to her in her youth, while a na’arah, go to her father. This would include the money used for her betrothal.
Introduction<br>Yesterday’s section concluded by positing that the biblical source for the idea that a father receives the betrothal money of his na’arah (between 12 and 12.5) daughter is the verse in Numbers 30 according to which all of the financial advantages accrued to a young girl go to her father. In today’s section the same law is learned from another verse, raising the question of which verse is the actual source.
The work that a daughter produces, her earnings, belongs to her father. Rav deduces this from the fact that a man may sell his daughter to be a maidservant. But if the verse from Numbers teaches that all of the financial advantages of a daughter go to her husband, why does Rav need to prove that a daughter’s handiwork goes to her father from that verse?
The Talmud now admits that the verse from Numbers does not have broader implications. It refers only to the annulment of vows and not to a father’s right to his daughter’s betrothal money. And should we suggest that just as a father has a right to annul his daughter’s vows, so too he has right to his daughter’s betrothal money, this must be rejected for one cannot derive laws regarding monetary matters from the laws of vows.
The Talmud suggests that we derive the fact that the father receives the betrothal money from the fact, learned earlier in Ketubot, that he receives any fines owed to her, such as those for rape and seduction. However, the laws of fines differ from the laws of monetary payments and therefore there is a rule that the latter cannot be derived from the former.
If a na’arah is raped/seduced the payments for the shame and blemish go to her father (we learned this earlier in Ketubot). But this cannot be a source for the father’s receiving the betrothal money because there is a difference with shame and blemish. The meaning of “since the father is involved” is not entirely clear. I believe that the words could mean that when she is shamed or blemished, the father also suffers. In any case, we still have no source for how we know that the father receives the betrothal money.
The resolution of how we know that the father receives the money goes back to the original source—the fact that when the daughter sold into slavery goes free, the master does not receive a payment. Had there been a payment, the master would have received it. Thus, logically, in the case of betrothal, where there is a payment, the money goes to the father, who is akin to the master.
The problem is that the comparison between the two “going outs” is not precise. When the maidservant goes free, she becomes completely free. Her master retains no control. But betrothal is only a partial transfer of authority. Her father still retains some authority over her and will continue to do so until she enters the huppah. So how can the two be compared?
The answer is that in one respect, even though still living in her father’s house, the father has lost control over her at betrothal—he no longer has the right to unilaterally annul her vows. Once betrothed, the father and husband jointly annul her vows.
The Talmud now goes on to ask how we know that the father has a right to marry his daughter off through a document or by giving her to the husband for intercourse. The answer is that all of the ways of becoming a wife are included in one verb in the verse. This comparison is invoked when the Talmud wishes to compare one way of becoming a wife with another. Again, for a longer discussion of how betrothal is contracted, see my commentary on the first mishnah of Kiddushin.

Daf 47a

Introduction<br>This week’s daf continues to explain the mishnah that opened the second half of the chapter. As a reminder, this mishnah listed some of the main financial advantages a father receives from his daughter.
 The mishnah stated that the husband receives any lost object that the wife finds. The Talmud explains that this is to prevent enmity. If she keeps her lost object and he is providing for her, he will be angry at her and resent her.
A husband has rights to any of the work his daughter does—her earnings. The source for this is the comparison the verse makes between a daughter and a maidservant—just as the latter gives her work to her master, so a daughter must give her handiwork to her father. This midrash was also found at the end of daf 46b.
The father receives his daughter’s handiwork until she reaches majority age, 12.5. But he can only sell her when she is a minor (until she is 12). So how do we know that he receives her handiwork between the ages of 12-12.5, when she is a na’arah? [To recall, in mishnaic/Talmudic times selling one’s daughter was not something that could occur. It is a passage from the Torah, but by this period in history, Jewish law found ways to prevent it.]
The Talmud concludes that the fact that the father has the right to determine when the marriage occurs, i.e. when she goes to the huppah, indicates that he has the right to her handiwork, for if he did not, by sending her to the huppah he would be denying her a day’s wages.
Ahai notes that the father could send his daughter to the huppah in a way in which she would not lose her wages. First of all, he could simply compensate her for lost time at work. Or he could send her to the huppah at a time when she would not be working. So the fact that he can send her to the huppah is not an ironclad proof that he has a right to her earnings. [Note: in reality marriage cannot take place on Shabbat or the festivals].
The final answer is that we don’t even need a verse/midrash to know that a father has a right to his minor daughter’s handiwork. This is simple logic. What we do need a verse for is to know that a father has a right to his na’arah daughter’s handiwork. Since he cannot sell her, we might have thought she keeps her earnings. Therefore, the verse, through a midrash, teaches us that her father has a right to these earnings as well.
Introduction<br>The Talmud continues to explain the sources of the laws concerning the father’s rights to derive benefit from his daughter.
The question here is not how do we know that a father has the right to annul his daughter’s vows. That is found explicitly in Numbers 30. The question is how do we know that he has this right when she is a na’arah? This is derived from the use of the word “in her youth” which has the same root as “na’arah.”
The Torah say, “And she goes out and becomes [a wife] to another man.” Just as her father receives her betrothal when she goes out, so too he receives her bill of divorce, should she be divorced before reaching majority age.
Introduction<br>The father does not have rights to the usufruct of his daughter while she is alive. Usufruct refers to the use or interest accrued through the property she owns. How does a daughter have her own property, you might ask? She could inherit it through her maternal grandfather. If her maternal grandfather dies and her mother is no longer alive, and the granddaughter is the only descendent, then the granddaughter receives the inheritance (or splits it with her sisters). So if this inheritance is, for instance, a field, the father does not have rights to use the field, or to take its produce.
The mishnah sided with the first opinion in this baraita. R. Yose the son of R. Judah holds that the father has such rights even while his daughter is still alive.
Later in the Talmud we will see the assumption that a husband receives rights to the usufruct from his wife’s property in return for his guarantee to redeem her should she be taken captive. The assumption seems to be that if he didn’t have some rights to her property, he would not redeem her. Quid pro quo.<br>But when it comes to the father, he would redeem his daughter anyway. Therefore, there is no reason for the rabbis to say that the father has the rights to usufruct from her property.<br>Note that the assumption here is that a father has greater love for his daughter than a husband for his wife. I think this is probably an accurate assumption in the Talmudic period.
Yose holds that the father might indeed refrain from redeeming his daughter if he does not receive the usufruct of her property. He’ll say to himself, “she’s got money, let her redeem herself.” But once he receives the usufruct, he will not be allowed to do this. Ultimately, while this may cost her, it will serve as an insurance policy of sorts to protect her.
