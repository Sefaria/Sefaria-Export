Mishnah Beitzah



Chapter 1

An egg laid on Yom Tov: Bet Shammai say: it may be eaten [on the same day]; But Bet Hillel say: it may not be eaten [until the day is over]. Bet Shammai say: [the quantity of] leaven is of the size of an olive and leavened bread is of the size of a date; But Bet Hillel say: both are of the size of an olive.
He who slaughters a wild animal or a bird on a festival Bet Shammai says: he may dig with a pronged tool and cover up [the blood], but Bet Hillel says: he may not slaughter unless he has had earth made ready. But they agree that if he did slaughter he should dig with a pronged tool and cover up [the blood, and] that the ashes of a stove count as being prepared for the holiday.
Bet Shammai says: one may not carry a ladder [on Yom Tov] from one dovecote to another, but he may incline it from one pigeon-hole to another. But Bet Hillel permits [this]. Bet Shammai says: one may not take [doves] unless he has shaken [them] the day before [Yom Tov]: But Bet Hillel says: he stands and declares: this one or that one I am taking.
If he designated black [doves] but found [on Yom Tov] white ones, white [doves] but found black ones, two but found three, they are [all] forbidden. [If he designated] three but found two, they are permitted. [If he designated doves] inside the nest and found them in front of the nest, they are forbidden. But if none were there except these, they are permitted.
Bet Shammai says: one may not remove shutters on Yom Tov. But Bet Hillel permits even to return them to their place. Bet Shammai says: one may not take a pestle even to cut up meat on it. But Bet Hillel permits [it]. Bet Shammai says: one may not place a hide in front of one who treads upon it nor may he even lift it up unless there is an olive’s worth of flesh on it. But Bet hillel permit it. Bet Shammai says: one may not carry out an infant or a lulav or a Torah scroll into the public domain. But Bet Hillel permit [it].
Bet Shammai says: one may not take hallah or priestly gifts to a priest on Yom Tov, whether they were separated on the day before or on that day. But Bet Hillel permits it. Bet Shammai said to them: An analogy [supports our view]: hallah and priestly gifts go to the priest and terumah [likewise] goes to the priest; just as one may not take [to the priest] terumah so one may not take [to him] priestly gifts. Bet Hillel said to them: No! If you say in the case of terumah which he has not the right to separate, will you say [the same] with respect to priestly gifts which he is permitted to separate?
Bet Shammai says: spices may be crushed with a wooden pestle and salt in a small cruse or with a wooden ladle. But Bet Hillel says: spices may be crushed in the usual way with a stone pestle and salt with a wooden pestle.
One who sorts beans on Yom Tov:Bet Shammai says: he must sort the edible parts and eat [them immediately]. But Bet Hillel says: he may sort as usual in his lap or in a basket or in a dish; but not with a board or in a sifter or in a sieve. Rabban Gamaliel says: he may even rinse them [in water] and skim off [the refuse].
Bet Shammai says: one may not send [gifts to a neighbor] on Yom Tov except portions [of food, ready to be eaten]. But Bet Hillel says: one may send cattle, game and poultry whether alive or slaughtered. One may [also] send wine, oil, flour or pulse but not grain. And Rabbi Shimon permits [even] grain.
One may send clothes, whether they are sewn up or not sewn up, and even though there is kil'ayim (mixed wool and linen) in them, provided they are necessary for the festival. But [one may] not [send] nailed sandals nor unfinished shoes. Rabbi Judah says: not even white shoes because they [still] require an artisan [to blacken them]. This is the general rule: whatever may be used on Yom Tov may [also] be sent [on Yom Tov].

Chapter 2

Yom Tov which fell on the eve of Shabbat, one should not begin to cook on Yom Tov for Shabbat. But he may cook for Yom Tov, and if any is left over it is left over for Shabbat. And he may prepare a dish on the eve of Yom Tov and rely upon it [to prepare food] for Shabbat. Bet Shammai says: two dishes. But Bet Hillel says: one dish. Yet they [both] agree that a fish and an egg upon it are [considered as] two dishes. [If] he ate it or it was lost, he may not begin to cook [relying] on it. But if he left over any [small] portion of it, he may rely on it [to cook] for Shabbat.
If [Yom Tov] fell on the day after Shabbat:Bet Shammai says: one must immerse everything [unclean] before Shabbat. But Bet Hillel says: vessels [must be immersed] before Shabbat but people [may immerse] on Shabbat.
They agree that one may effect surface contact for [unclean] water in a stone vessel in order to purify it, but one may not immerse [it]; And one may immerse [to change] from one intention to another or from one company to another.
Bet Shammai says: one may bring peace-offerings [on Yom Tov] but may not lay [hands] upon them, but one may not bring burnt-offerings [on Yom Tov]. Bet Hillel says: one may bring peace-offerings and burnt-offerings and also lay hands upon them.
Bet Shammai says: a man may not heat water for his feet unless it is also fit for drinking. But Bet Hillel permits it. A man may make a fire and warm himself at it.
In three cases Rabban Gamaliel was strict like the words of Beth Shammai.One may not cover up hot food on Yom Tov for Shabbat; And one may not join together a lamp on a festival; And one may not bake [on Yom] thick loaves but only wafer-cakes. Rabban Gamaliel said: “In all their days, my father’s house never baked large loaves but only wafer-cakes.” They said to him: “What can we do with regards to your father’s house, for they were strict in respect to themselves but were lenient towards Israel to let them bake both large loaves and even charcoal-roasted loaves.”
Also he declared three decisions of a lenient character:One may sweep up [on a festival] between the couches, And put spices [on the coals] on a festival; And roast a kid whole on the night of Passover. But the sages forbid them.
Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah allows three things and the Sages forbid them:His cow used to go out with the strap which she had between her horns; One may curry cattle on a festival; And one may grind pepper in its own mill. Rabbi Judah says: one may not curry cattle on a festival, because it may cause a wound, but one may comb them. But the Sages say: one may not curry them, and one may not even comb them.
A pepper-mill is susceptible to impurity on account of [it consisting of] three [separate] utensils; on account of a receptacle, on account of a metal utensil and on account of a sifting utensil.
A child’s cart is susceptible to the impurity of midras, and it may be handled on Shabbat, and it is dragged along only on matting. Rabbi Judah says: no vessels may be dragged along [the ground] except a wagon because it [only] presses [the earth] down.

Chapter 3

One may not catch fish from a fishpond on Yom Tov nor give them food, But one may catch game or fowl from animal enclosures and one may put food before them. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: not all enclosures are alike. This is the general rule: anything that still needs to be trapped is forbidden but anything that need not be trapped is permitted.
Traps for wild animals, birds or fish which were set on the eve of Yom Tov, one may not take from them on Yom Tov unless he knows that they were [already] caught on the eve of Yom Tov. It once happened that a certain non-Jew brought fish to Rabban Gamaliel [on Yom Tov] and he said: they are permitted, but I have no wish to accept [them] from him.
One may not slaughter [on Yom Tov] an animal which is about to die unless there is time enough on that day to eat from it as much as an olive of roasted flesh. Rabbi Akiva says: even [if there is only time to eat] as much as an olive of raw flesh [taken] from the place of slaughter. If he slaughtered it in the field, he may not bring it in on a pole or a barrow, but he may bring it in piece by piece in his hand.
A first-born beast that fell into a pit:Rabbi Judah says: let an expert go down and inspect [it]. If it had a blemish he may bring it up and slaughter it, but if not, he may not slaughter it. Rabbi Shimon says: any animals whose blemish was not observed on the day before the Yom Tov, it is not prepared (mukhan).
If a beast died [on Yom Tov] it may not be moved from its place. And it happened that they once asked Rabbi Tarfon concerning this and concerning hallah that had become defiled. He went into the bet midrash and inquired, and they answered him: they may not be moved from their place.
They may not be counted as having a share in an animal at the outset on Yom Tov, but they may be counted [as having a share in an animal] on the eve of Yom Tov, and they may then slaughter it and divide it between them [on Yom Tov]. Rabbi Judah says: a man may weigh meat [on Yom Tov] against a utensil or against a butcher's chopper. But the sages say: one may not pay attention to the scales at all.
One may not sharpen a knife on a festival, but one may draw it over another knife. A man may not say to a butcher, “Weigh me a dinar’s worth of meat” but he may slaughter [the animal] and shares it among them.
A man may say [on Yom Tov] to his fellow, “Fill me this vessel,” but not in a specific measure. Rabbi Judah says: if it was a measuring-vessel he may not fill it. It happened that Abba Shaul ben Batnit used to fill up his measures on the eve of Yom Tov and give them to his customers on Yom Tov. Abba Shaul says: he used to do so even during hol hamoed (the intermediate days of the festival), on account of clarifying the measures. But the sages say: he used also to do so on an ordinary day for the sake of the draining of the measures. A man may go to a shopkeeper to whom he generally goes and say to him, “Give me [so many] eggs and nuts” since this is the way of a householder to reckon in his own home.

Chapter 4

One who carries jars of wine from place to place, he may not carry them in a basket or in a large basket, but he may carry [them] on his shoulder or in front of him. Similarly, one who brings straw, he may not drape a large basket over his back, rather he must carry it in his hand. And one may start [using] a heap of straw, but [one may] not [start using wood] from the back-yard.
One may not take wood from a sukkah but only from [what is] next to it. One may bring in from the field wood that is gathered together, and from a karpef [an enclosure] even though it is scattered about. What is a karpef? Any [enclosure] next to the town, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Yose says: Any [enclosure] which one enters with a key, even if it is [only just] within the Shabbat border.
One may not chop up wood, neither from beams nor from a beam which was broken on Yom Tov. And one may not chop with an axe or with a saw or with a sickle but only with a [butcher's] chopper. A [closed] room full of produce which was burst open [on Yom Tov] he may take [produce] out through the breach. Rabbi Meir says: he may make a hole at the outset and bring out [the produce].
One may not make a hole in a [lump of clay for use as a] lamp because that is making a vessel. One may not make charcoal on Yom Tov. And one may not cut a wick into two. Rabbi Judah says: he may cut it into two lamps using a fire.
One may not break up a potsherd or cut paper in order to roast on it a salty fish. And one may not rake out an oven or a range, but one may press [the ashes] down. And one may not place two jars side by side in order to balance upon them saucepan. And one may not prop up a pot with a wooden wedge and the same applies to a door. And one may not drive cattle with a staff on a festival. But Rabbi Elazar the son of Rabbi Shimon permits it.
Rabbi Eliezer says: a man may take a chip from that which is lying before him to pick his teeth with it, and he may collect [chips] from the court yard and make a fire, for everything in a court is prepared [for use on Yom Tov]. But the sages say: he may collect only from that which is before him and make a fire.
One may not produce fire either from wood, or from stones, or from dirt, or from water. Nor may one make tiles red-hot in order to roast on them. Rabbi Eliezer further said: A man may stand near his “muktzeh” on the eve of Shabbat in the sabbatical year and say: “From here I will eat tomorrow.” But the sages say: [This doesn’t work] unless he marks it out and says, “From here to there.”

Chapter 5

One may let down fruit through a trap-door on Yom Tov but not on Shabbat. And one may cover up fruit with vessels on account of the rain, and likewise jars of wine and jars of oil. And one may place a vessel beneath the drops of rain [even] on Shabbat.
Every [act] for which one is liable on Shabbat because of mandated rest [shevut], [or] because it is only optional [reshut], [or] even though it is a religious act [mitzvah], he is also liable on Yom Tov.For the following acts he is liable because of shevut: One may not climb a tree, And one may not ride on an animal. And one may not swim in water. And one may not clap hands, nor slap [thighs], nor dance. For the following acts he is liable because they are only optional: One may not judge; And one may not betroth a wife, nor perform halizah, nor perform yibbum [consumate a levirate marriage]. And for the following acts one is liable even though it is a religious act [mitzvah]: One may not dedicate [anything to the Temple], nor vow a personal valuation, nor make a vow of herem, nor set aside terumah or tithes. All these things they [the rabbis said that they are forbidden] on Yom Tov, how much more so [are they forbidden] on Shabbat. There is no difference between Yom Tov and Shabbat except for the preparation of food alone.
A beast and utensils are [restricted to the same limits] as the feet of the owners. One who gives his cow over to his son or to a cowherd [to tend], they are [restricted to the same limits] as the feet of the owner. Vessels which have been set apart for [the use of] one of the brothers in a house, are [restricted to the same limits] as his feet, but [those utensils] which have not been so set apart, can be taken [only] to a place where [all the brothers] may go.
One who borrows a vessel from his neighbor on the eve of Yom Tov, [it is restricted to the same limits] as the feet of the borrower. [But if he borrowed it] on Yom Tov, it is as the feet of the lender. A woman who borrowed from her neighbor spices, water or salt for her dough, these are [restricted to the same limits] as the feet of both them. Rabbi Judah exempts in the case of water, because it is not substantial.
A live coal is [restricted to the same limits] as its owner, but a flame can be taken anywhere. In respect of a live coal of sanctified property [one who makes use of it] is considered as having trespassed, but as for a flame [of sanctified property], one may not derive benefit from it, but [one who does] has not trespassed. If one carries out a live coal into the public domain [on Shabbat] he is liable, but [if he carries out] a flame he is exempt. [The water from]: A private well is [restricted to the same limits] as its owner, And [the water from a well] belonging to the inhabitants of that town is [restricted to the same limits] as the people of that town; And [the water from a well] belonging to those who came up from Babylonia is [restricted to the same limits] as he who draws [the water].
If one has his produce in another town, and the inhabitants of that city made an eruv in order to bring to him some of his produce, they may not bring it to him. But if he himself made an eruv, his produce is like himself.
If one invited guests to his home, they may not take away with them [any] portions unless he [the host] had assigned for them their portions on the eve of Yom Tov. One may not give drink and then slaughter wilderness animals, but one may give drink and slaughter household animals. The following are household animals: they that spend the night in town. Pasture animals are they that spend the night in pasture ground.
