Chapter 1

A quarter lug of water is poured on [the hands of] one person, also on [the hands of] two [persons], half a lug on three or four, a whole lug and upwards on five, or ten, or even one hundred [persons]. R. José saith, "Provided always, there be not less for the last [person using the water] than a quarter [of a lug]." They may add [water] for the second [ablution], but they must not add [any] for the first.
From all [kinds of] vessels they may pour on the hands, even from vessels [made] of cow-dung, or vessels of stone, or of earth. But they must not pour [water] on the hands out of the sides [fragments] of a vessel, or the bottom of a tub, or the bung of a cask: nor [must a man] give to his neighbour [water] out of the hollow of his [own] hand, because they must not draw, or consecrate, or sprinkle the water of purification, or pour [water] on the hands, except [it be] in a vessel. [In cases of uncleanness arising from the tent] they cannot preserve [therefrom], by means of a close cover, [any utensils] except [whole] vessels [only]; nor can they preserve [the contents of] an earthen vessel, [into which a dead reptile has fallen, from contracting uncleanness], except [closed] utensils [only].
Water which [on account of its bad smell] is unfit for [domestic] animals to drink, is unfit [for ablution, if contained] in [any kind of] vessels; but on the ground [in a ditch], it is fit [for ablution, by immersing the hands therein]. Should ink, gum, or vitriol black drop into it [the water], so that its colour be changed, it becomes unfit [for ablution]. If it has been used for any purpose, or he [a man] has soaked his bread therein, it [the water] becomes unfit [for ablution]. Simeon, the Temanite, said, "[What!] even though he intended to soak something in one vessel and it dropped into another? [No] it continues fit [for ablution]."
Has he rinsed vessels therein [the water], or [used it] to rinse out measures, it becomes unfit; but if he rinsed therein vessels which already had been rinsed [clean], or new ones, [the water so used] continues fit [for ablution]. R. José prohibits it[s use] in [the case of] new vessels.
Water in which the baker has dipped rolls is unfit [for ablution], but has he only dipped his hands therein it continues fit. All are qualified to pour water on [other persons’] hands, even the deaf and dumb, idiot or minor. A man may hold a cask between his knees to pour the water [over his hands]. An ape may pour water on [a person's] hands. R. José declares these two [last-mentioned modes of pouring water on the hands as legally] improper.

Chapter 2

If he [a person] has poured [water] on one hand at one gush, his hand is clean; [if] on both hands at one gush, R. Meir declares them [still to continue] unclean, until he has poured [water] out of a quarter-lug [vessel] upon them. Should a loaf of heave 1 fall [on the water], it [remains] clean. R. José [however] declares it unclean.
Has he poured out his first [ablution] in one place, and his second in another place, should a loaf of heave fall on the first, it [becomes] unclean, if on the second, it [remains] clean. Has he poured out his first and second [ablutions] into one place, and a loaf of heave fall thereon, it [becomes] unclean. Should he pour out his first [ablution], and find on his hand a splinter or small stone, his hands continue unclean, as the second water only purifies the first [water] on the hand. R. Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, "Whatsoever is a production of the water, [and is found on the hand after the first ablution, does not prevent the hand from being] clean."
The hands become unclean or clean up to the wrist. How [is this meant]? Should he pour the first [ablution] up to the wrist, and the second [ablution] above the wrist, and some of the water runs back into the hand, that [continues] clean. Should he have poured [both] the first and the second [ablutions] above the wrist, and some of the water runs back into the hand, that [becomes] unclean. Should he have poured the first [ablution] over one hand, and then the second [ablution] over both hands together, they are unclean. Should he have poured the first [ablution] over both hands, and then the second [ablution] over one hand only, his hand is clean. Should he have poured [water] on one hand, and then rubbed it against its fellow [his other hand], it [the hand on which he poured the water] becomes unclean; [but if he rubbed it] against his head, or against the wall, it remains clean. They may [at once] pour [water] over [the hands of] four or five [persons] alongside of each other or above each other, provided always, they be careful that the water comes on [every part of] their hands.
[Should he be] in doubt whether it [the water] has been used for any purpose or not; [should he be] in doubt whether he had the prescribed quantity or not; [or should he be] in doubt whether [the water was legally] unclean or clean: in all these [cases of] doubt he is clean, because they [the sages] decided, "That whenever it is questionable whether the hands are unclean, [or] impart uncleanness, or are clean, [they are to be considered as] clean." R. Jose [however] held "[That whenever it is questionable whether the hands are] clean, they are [to be considered as] unclean." How [is this rule to be applied]? Were his hands clean, and two unclean loaves before him, should he be in doubt whether he touched them or not, [or,] his hands being unclean, and two clean loaves before him, he is in doubt whether he touched them or not, [ore] one of his hands being unclean and the other clean, there were before him two clean loaves, one of which he touched, should he be in doubt whether he touched it with the unclean [hand], or with the clean [one], [or,] his hands being clean, and there were before him two loaves, one unclean and the other clean, one of which he touched, should he be in doubt whether he touched the unclean or the clean [loaf, or,] his hands being one unclean and one clean, and before him two loaves, one unclean and one clean, both of which he touched, should he be in doubt [whether he touched] the unclean [loaf] with the unclean [hand], and the clean [loaf] with the clean [hand], or the clean [loaf] with the unclean [hand], and the unclean [loaf] with the clean [hand]: in all [these cases] the hands remain as they were, and the loaves as they were.

Chapter 3

He who introduces his hands into a house that is smitten [with leprosy, thereby causes] his hands [to become unclean in a] primary [degree]. Such is the dictum of R. Akivah; but the sages decide, "[He causes] his hands [to become unclean in a] secondary [degree]." Whatever renders garments unclean at the time of [coming into] contact therewith, causes the hands to become unclean [in a] primary degree. Such is the dictum of R. Akivah; but the sages decide, "[It causes the hands] to become [unclean in a] secondary [degree]." They [the sages, moreover] said to R. Akivah, "When do we ever find [that] the hands [become unclean in a] primary [degree]?" He answered them, "How is it possible that they [the hands] can become [unclean in a] primary [degree] unless the whole body has [previously] become unclean, except in the present instance." Articles of food, and vessels which have become unclean through liquids, cause the hands to become unclean [in a] secondary [degree]. Such is the dictum of R. Joshua; but the sages decide, "That which is become unclean through an Ab Hatoomah makes the hands unclean; [but that winch is become] unclean through a Ab Hatoomah does not make the hands unclean." R. Simeon ben Gamaliel said, "It happened that a woman came before my father, and stated to him, 'My hands got into the empty space of an [unclean] earthen vessel:' he asked her, 'My daughter, from what [cause] did the uncleanness arise?' but I did not hear what she said to him." The sages replied, "The case is clear; that which is become unclean through an Ab Hatoomah makes the hands unclean, [but that which is become unclean] through a Ab Hatoomah does not make the hands unclean."
Whatever disqualifies heave causes the hands to become [unclean in a] secondary [degree]. One hand makes the other hand unclean. Such is the dictum of R. Joshua; but the sages decide, "That no secondary can make a secondary." R. Joshua [objected and] said to them [the sages], "Are not sacred scriptures secondaries, and [nevertheless they do] make the hands unclean?" [But] they answered him, "The commandments of the [written] law cannot be subjected to conclusions drawn from the dicta of the Sopherim [scribes], nor these dicta to those commandments, nor yet dicta of the Sopherim to others of their dicta."
Leather straps of Tephilin, with the Tephilin [attached thereto] make the hands unclean. R. Simeon saith, "The straps of Tephilin do not make the hands unclean."
The margin in a book of the Law, at the top and at the bottom, at the beginning and at the end [thereof], makes the hands unclean. R. Jose saith, "[The margin] at the end does not make the hands unclean until the roller is attached to it."
A book [of the Law, in] which [the writing] is obliterated, but which still contains eighty-five letters, [a number] equal to the Parasha ‏ויהי בנסוע הארון‎, makes the hands unclean. Any Megillah which contains eighty-five letters, [a number] equal to the above named Parasha, makes the hands unclean. All sacred scriptures make the hands unclean. The Canticles and Ecclesiastes make the hands unclean. R. Jehudah saith, "Canticles make the hands unclean, but Ecclesiastes is [subject to] a dispute [difference of opinion]." R. José saith, "Ecclesiastes does not make the hands unclean, but the Canticles are [subject to] a dispute." R. Simeon saith, "Ecclesiastes is one of [those observances in which] Beth Shammai [are] less strict, and Beth Hillel more rigid." R. Simeon ben Azai said, "I have it as a tradition from the mouths of seventy-two elders, on the day they inducted R. Eleazar ben Azariah into the president's seat, that Canticles and Ecclesiastes [both] make the hands unclean." R. Akivah said, "Mercy forbid! no man in Israel ever disputed that the Canticles make the hands unclean, as the whole [history of the] world does not [offer an epoch] equal to the day on which the [book] Canticles was given to Israel; for all the Kethoobim [Hagiographers] are holy, but the Canticles are holy of holies. The dispute [in question, therefore,] referred to Ecclesiastes [only]." R. Jochanan ben Joshua, the son of R. Akivah's father-in-law, said, "Even as Ben Azai stated, so was the dispute, and so was [also] the decision."

Chapter 4

On that very day they divided and decided, "That a trough used to wash the feet [and capable of] containing from two lug to nine kab—which has been split [near the bottom], may become unclean from pressure," although R. Akivah contended that [such] a trough always remains like what it is named.
On the same day they decided, "That all sacrifices which have been brought under an improper designation, are valid, but do not absolve the owners from their obligation, except the paschal sacrifice, and the sin-offering; the paschal sacrifice in due season, and the sin-offering at all times." R. Eleazar saith, "The trespass-offering likewise: the paschal sacrifice in its due season, and the sin or trespass-offering at all times." R. Simeon ben Azai said, "I have it as a tradition from the mouths of seventy-two elders, on the day they inducted R. Eleazar ben Azariah into the president's seat, that all sacrifices [which may be eaten] that have been brought under an improper designation, are valid, but do not absolve the owners of their obligation, except the paschal sacrifice and the sin-offering." Ben Azai only added the burnt-offering, but the sages did not coincide with him.
On the same day they argued: [The land of] Ammon and [of] Moab, how are they [affected] by the Sabbatical year [of agrarian rest]? R. Tarphon decided, "[That Israelites residing in those countries must pay] tithes for the poor;" but R. Eleazar bell Azariah decided, "[They must pay] second tithes." R. Ishmael then said, "Eleazar ben Azariah, it behoves thee to prove thy assertion, for thou enactest a more rigid observance; and whosoever enacts a more rigid observance, with him rests the onus of making good his decision." R. Eleazar ben Azariah replied, "Ishmael, my brother, I have not deviated from the regular order [series] of the years, but my brother Tarphon has deviated therefrom, therefore, the onus probandi rests on him." R. Tarphon [then] replied, "Egypt is out of the land [of Israel; abroad], and Ammon and Moab are out of the land [of Israel; abroad]: even as Egypt [pays] tithe for the poor in the Sabbatical year, so Ammon and Moab [must likewise pay] tithe for the poor during the Sabbatical year." R. Eleazar ben Azariah replied, "Babylon is out of the land [of Israel; abroad], and Ammon and Moab are out of the land [of Israel]: even as Babylon [pays] second tithe during the Sabbatical year, so Ammon and Moab [must likewise pay] second tithe during the Sabbatical year." R. Tarphon [further] replied, "Egypt being near [adjoining to the land of Israel], is subjected to tithe for the poor, in order that the poor in Israel may be thereby supported during the Sabbatical year; so likewise Ammon and Moab, which are near [adjoining the land of Israel], must also be subjected to tithe for the poor, in order that the poor in Israel may be thereby supported during the Sabbatical year." To this R. Eleazar ben Azariah replied, "Thou seekest to increase the money [contributed for the poor], but in truth thou losest souls; wouldst thou be the cause that heaven should send down neither dew nor rain, as it is said (Malachi 3:8) 'Shall a man defraud God? Yet ye have defrauded me. But ye say, In what have we defrauded thee? In tithes and heave-offerings.'" R. Joshua then said, "Behold, I will answer for my brother Tarphon, although not according to his mode of argumentation. [The regulation concerning] Egypt is newly established; [whereas that concerning] Babylon is established of old; the subject before us [also relates to a regulation to be] newly established. Let, therefore, [one] new regulation be subjected to conclusions drawn from [another] new regulation; but let not a new regulation be subjected to conclusions drawn from an old established regulation. [Moreover, the regulation concerning] Egypt is established by the elders [of the great Sanhedrin; whereas the regulation concerning] Babylon is established by the prophets [their predecessors]; the subject before us [also relates to a regulation to be] established by elders. Let, therefore, [one] regulation established by elders be subjected to conclusions drawn from [another] regulation established by elders, but let not a regulation by elders be subjected to conclusions drawn from a regulation by prophets." They [the sages] then divided, and [the majority] decided, "That Ammon and Moab must pay tithe for the poor during the Sabbatical year." When R. José ben Dormiskith came to R. Eleazar [ben Hyrcanos], at Lydda, he [R. Eleazar] inquired of him, "What had ye new in the Beth Medrash [College] to-day?" He [R. José] replied, "They divided and decided, that Ammon and Moab must pay tithe for the poor in the Sabbatical year." [On hearing this], R. Eleazar wept, and exclaimed (Psalms 25:14): "The secrets of the Lord are for those who fear him, and his covenant to be made known to them; go forth and tell them, Ye need be under no apprehension on account of the decision you have adopted, for I have it as a tradition from the mouth of Rabbon Jochanan ben Zachai, who heard it from his teacher, who heard it from his teacher, even up to the decision of Moses from Sinai, that Ammon and Moab pay tithes to the poor during the Sabbatical year.'"
On that day came Judah, an Ammonitish proselyte, and stood before them in the Medrash. He said to them [the sages], "How am I [situated with respect] to coming into the congregation [of Israel]?" Rabbon Gamaliel answered him, "Thou art prohibited." R. Joshua answered him, "Thou art permitted." Rabbon Gamaliel then said, "The Scripture saith (Deuteronomy 23:4): 'An Ammonite and a Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord, even to their tenth generation,' and so forth." To this R. Joshua replied, "Are then the Ammonites or Moabites still in their own land? Sennacherib, king of Assyria, did already long ago march up and intermix the nations, as it is said (Isaiah 10:13) 'I have removed the bounds of the nations, have plundered their treasures, and laid low the might of the inhabitants.'" "[But]," said Rabbon Gamaliel to him, "the Scriptures declare (Jeremiah 49:6): 'And afterwards I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon,' and [therefore] they are already returned." [To this] R. Joshua replied, "The Scriptures [also] declare (Amos 9:14): 'I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel' [and Judah], but [nevertheless] they are not yet returned;" upon which they [the sages] permitted him [the Ammonitish proselyte] to come into the congregation.
The Targum [Chaldee passages] in Ezra and Daniel makes the hands unclean. Targum written in Hebrew characters, and Hebrew written in Targum [Syriac] characters or in Hebrew characters, do not make the hands unclean. In no case do [sacred Scriptures] make [the hands] unclean, unless the writing be Assyrian [square] characters on parchment with ink.
The Sadducees said, "We blame [object to] you Pharisees, because you say, 'Sacred Scriptures make the hands unclean, but the books Hameram do not make the hands unclean.'" Rabbon Jochanan ben Zachai replied [ironically], "And have we nothing else to object to the Pharisees but this? They also assert that the bones of an ass are clean, but the bones of Jochanan the high priest are unclean." They [the Sadducees] replied, "According to their love [the estimation in which the bones are held] is their uncleanness, so that no one may turn the bones of his father and mother into spoons." He answered them, "In like manner [are] the sacred Scriptures; according to their love [the high estimation in which they are held] is their uncleanness; whereas the books Hameram, which are not beloved [held in no esteem], do not make the hands unclean."
The Sadducees said, "We blame [object to] you Pharisees, that ye declare the stream [which flows when water is poured from a clean vessel into an unclean one] to be clean." The Pharisees replied [with much better right], "We [may] blame [object to] you Sadducees, that ye declare a streamlet of water which flows from a burial ground to be clean." The Sadducees [further] said, "We blame [object to] you Pharisees, because ye say, 'If mine ox or mine ass cause any damage, I am bound [to make compensation], but should my bondman or bondwoman cause any damage, I am absolved [from making compensation];' if I am bound for mine ox and mine ass, respecting which there are no duties enjoined on me, [does it not follow that] for my bondman or bondwoman, respecting whom there are duties enjoined on me, it is just that I should [also] be bound [to compensate] for the damage he [or she] occasions?" [But] they [the Pharisees] replied, "Not the same rule which applies to mine ox or mine ass, that are not possessed of reason, can apply to my bondman or bondwoman, who are possessed of reason; for, should I offend them, they may [maliciously] set fire to the growing corn of another person, in order that I might be bound to pay for it."
A Galilean Sadducee said, "I blame [object to] you Pharisees, that you insert the name of the sovereign in the same document [letter of divorce] with Moses." The Pharisees replied [with much better reason], "We [might] blame [object to] thee, Galilean Sadducee, that ye inscribe the [name of the] sovereign with the Holy Name on the same page: and not only that, but ye inscribe the sovereign first, as it is said (Exodus 5:2): 'And Pharaoh said, Who is the Lord that I should hearken to his voice to let Israel go?'" [But when he was punished, he exclaimed (Exodus 9:11): "The Lord is righteous."]
