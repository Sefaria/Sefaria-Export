The person who burns the red cow (of Numbers 19:1–22) or the bulls (that are burned pursuant to Leviticus 4:3–21 or 16:27) and the person who leads away the scapegoat (pursuant to Leviticus 16:7-10 and 26) render clothes [that they wear while so doing] unclean.  The red cow, the bulls, and the scapegoat do not themselves render clothes [with which they come in contact] unclean.  This one [the clothing] says [to the person]: “Those that render you unclean do not render me unclean, but you render me unclean.”
