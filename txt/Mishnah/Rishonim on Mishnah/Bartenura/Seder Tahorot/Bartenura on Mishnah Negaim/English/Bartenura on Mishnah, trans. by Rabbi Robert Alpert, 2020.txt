Bartenura on Mishnah Negaim



Chapter 1



Mishnah 1

מראות נגעים (the appearance of plagues – i.e., leprosy) – are written explicitly in Scripture (Leviticus 13:2: “When a person has on the skin of his body a swelling/שאת, a rash/ספחת, or a discoloration/בהרת, and it develops into a scaly affection on the skin of his body,”), a swelling/שאת and a discoloration/בהרת (referred to by Jastrow dictionary as a bright white spot on the skin
שהן ארבעה – you must include two others that are not written in Scripture, and they are subcategories/תולדה (i.e., a secondary category derived from a primary category. It is not a primary category but is derived from that source, either as a legal inference or as a factual derivative) and they are a subcategory of שאת/swelling and a subcategory of בהרת/discoloration/bright white spot on the skin. And we include them from ספחת/a rash, for ספחת/rash is not the name of a plague but a secondary expression. And similarly, it (i.e., Scripture) states (I Samuel 2:36): [And all the survivors of your house shall come and bow low to him for the sake of a money fee and a loaf of bread and say,] ‘Please assign me to one of the priestly duties, [that I may have a morsel of bread to eat’].” And Scripture placed ספחת/a rash between שאת/swelling and בהרת/bright white spot on the skin to inform you that there is a subcategory to שאת/swelling and a subcategory to בהרת/bright white spot on the skin.
בהרת עזה כשלג (an intensely bright spot – sparkling – like snow) – the most white. As it is written (Leviticus 13:4): “But if it is a white discoloration [on the skin of his body which does not appear to be deeper than the skin and the hair in it has not turned white],” it is white and there is nothing of a higher level of white than it. (For the derivative to this, כסיד ההיכל/like the limestone in the Temple – see Tractate Middot, Chapter 3, Mishnah 4 – which were whitened every year before Passover.)
שאת כקרום ביצה (the swelling is like the color of the membrane surrounding the egg) – for this Tanna/teacher [of the Mishnah] holds that שאת/swelling is not other than the language of something of height. And similarly, it (i.e., Scripture) states (Isaiah 2:14): “And all the lofty hills.” For you don’t have something as dim/faint in its whiteness (as opposed to the strong, intensely bright spot of the בהרת/discoloration which is sparkling like now) in all four appearances of plagues like the membrane surrounding an egg, therefore, it is loftier than all of them, like the appearance of a shadow above from the sun.
שניה לה כצמר לבן – The Rabbis hold, there are two strong appearances which are snow and white wool, these are for the two principal/direct [forms of plagues], בהרת/discoloration/bright white spot on the skin and שאת/rash, and two appearances [of plagues] that are fainter from them are the limestone in the Temple and the color of the membrane of the egg, and they are derivatives/subcategories . Give the large derivative (or subcategory) to the large one, that is, the limestone of the Temple to the בהרת/discoloration which is a large primary [appearance of a plague], and the small derivative/subcategory to the small one, that is the membrane of the egg to the שאת/swelling which is smaller than the בהרת/discoloration. 
And the practical difference in the dispute of the Rabbis and the first Tanna/teacher [of the Mishnah, Rabbi Meir] is in regard to fusion (i.e., the state of being considered as one coherent mass or as one act), for half of a Cilician bean (seen as the standard for eruptions) from a primary category and half of a Cilician bean from its derivative/subcategory fuse together/combine. And similarly, the two primary categories שאת/a swelling and בהרת/discoloration combine, for we expound upon (Leviticus 13:2): “And it develops into a scaly affection on the skin of his body”/והיה בעור-בשרו לנגע teaching that they combine with one another, as it is written (Leviticus 13:2): "והיה"/and it – and it is not written: "והיו"/and they - make all of the plagues one. But the two derivatives/subcategories do not combine/fuse, for the derivative/subcategory of בהרת/discoloration/bright white spot on the skin does not combine with the derivative/subcategory of שאת/a swelling, and [the word] "והיה"/and [the word] "והיה"/and it – does not refer other than to שאת/a swelling and בהרת/a discoloration/bright white spot on the skinthat are written explicitly, but not to the derivatives [or subcategories] that come from the extension of scope/widening amplification [of Rabbinic exegesis]. And now, according to the first Tanna/teacher [of the Mishnah], snow and the membrane of an egg combine/fuse, snow and white wool do not fuse/combine. But to the Rabbis, snow and white wool combine/fuse, snow and the membrane [of an egg] do not combine/fuse. And he Halakha is according to the Sages.
צמר לבן – pure wool of sheep one day old after it was washed and cleansed.

Mishnah 2

הפתוך שבשלג (the variegation of the snow-white leprosy) – that is mixed in the white color and red substance that is in the בהרת/discoloration/bright white spot on the skin that it appears as an intensely bright spot sparkling like snow. כיין המזוג בשלג (like the red wine mixed with the snow – before the latter is dissolved) – for its whiteness is greater and its redness is less.
הפתוך שבסיד ההיכל – that which is combined in the plague which is like the lime of the Temple, appears. כדם המזוג בחלב – for the redness that is in it is greater. And even though it (i.e., the Mishnah) doesn’t teach פתוך/the variegation other than with the בהרת /discoloration and its derivatives or subcategories, the same law applies for there is also variegation in the שאת/swelling and its derivatives or subcategories, as it is taught in Torat Kohanim (i.e., the Sifra) (Leviticus 13:10): “a white swelling [on the /skin]/שאת לבנה [which has turned some hair white],” (see also Leviticus 13:19), it teaches that it defiles part of it. [The phrase] "בהרת לבנה אדמדמת"/a white discoloration/bright spot on the skin streaked with red (Leviticus 13:19), teaches that it defiles with variegation. From where [do we learn] to give that which is stated of this one and with that one (i.e., wine mixed with in snow and blood mixed in milk – describing the variegation of the lime in the Temple)? The inference teaches us (Leviticus 13:9): "נגע צרעת"/When a person has a scaly affection.
שבזה ושבזה – that is in the snow and in the lime [of the Temple].
דיהה (is fainter) – it is missing from the whiteness, which is not bright/resplendent in its whiteness like it. And the Halakha is according to Rabbi Akiba.

Mishnah 3

מארבעה מראות הללו מצטרפין – we have the reading [of מארבעה/from among four] and we don’t have the reading of ארבעה מראות/four appearances, for all the four appearances do not combine/join together, that a derivative/subcategory does not join together with its primary category, and two derivatives/subcategories do not combine/join together with each other. But the two primary categories do combine. From what is written (Leviticus 13:2): "והיה בעור בשרו"/“and it develops [into a scaly affection] on the skin of his body,” but it is not written: "והיו" /”and they will,” which implies that one can make סאת/a swelling and בהרת/a discoloration/bright white spot on the skin like one thing, that if there is one-half of a [Cilicean] bean of this one and one-half of a [Cilicean] bean of that one, they combine to becoming a complete bean. But Maimonides wrote, that all four of the appearances (i.e., including the subcategories or derivatives] combine. And the Tosefta [Tractate Negaim, Chapter 1, Halakha 4] supports him.
לפטור ולהחליט ולהסגיר (to absolve or to declare a person a leper or to lock up the leper pending the observation of the Kohen) – all of these things combine. And all of them are being explained.
להסגיר העומד בשבוע ראשון – as it is written (Leviticus 13:5): “On the seventh day the priest shall examine him, and if the affection has remained unchanged in color [and the disease has not spread on the skin,] the priest shall isolate the affected person for seven [additional] days.”
ולפטור את העומד בסוף שבוע שני – that which stands in its measure and did not spread and stood in its appearance, even though it did not go downward from the four appearances, he frees him at he end of the second week. But surely as it is written (Leviticus 13:6): “On the seventh day the priest shall examine him again: if the affection has faded [and not spread on the skin], the priest shall pronounce him pure,” that is not to say that he did not pronounce him pure unless [the affection] faded, but rather the Biblical verse teaches us that even if it changed from snow to lime, or from lime to snow, we don’t say that it is another plague and he returns and [the priest] isolates him as at the outset, but rather that he is as it stands, and he purifies him.
להחליט את שנולד לו מחיה ושער לבן בתחלה – that when he is brought to the Kohen at the beginning [of his being diagnosed with an affection] and he has upon him a discoloration like the Cilician bean or quick flesh like a squared lentil within the place of the discoloration, he declares him to be a leper immediately. And similarly, also for [the appearance of] white hair, for if it was black and he didn’t have sufficient time to shut him in until it had turned white, he declares him to be a leper immediately. But the spreading of a leprous spot (see Leviticus 13:7-8): “But if the rash should spread on the skin after he has presented himself to the priest and been pronounced pure, he shall present himself again to the priest. And if the priest sees that the rash has spread on the skin, the priest shall pronounce him impure; it is leprosy.”), even if it gradually spreads until he doesn’t shut him up [in isolation].
בסוף שבוע ראשון – that is to say, to declare him to be a leper like this at the end of the first week, for from the outset he didn’t have these signs [of affliction] and they locked him up/isolated him, but at the end of the first week, he (i.e., the Kohen) found in him a patch of un-discolored flesh [in the swelling] (see Leviticus 13:10) or white hair, and he definitely declares him to be a leper.
או בסוף שבוע השני – as for example, that at the end of the first week, it (i.e., the affection) remained unchanged and he did not have in either white hair or a patch of un-discolored flesh [in the swelling], [and the Kohen shut him in isolation a second time], and at the end of the second week, these signs appear, he (i.e., the Kohen) declares him to be a leper.
לאחר הפטור – meaning to say, that even after the clearance that was at the end of the second week, no signs of defilement appeared in him and they released/cleared him, but after a few days, they appeared, he (i.e., the Kohen) declares him to be a leper.
את שנולד לו פשיון בסוף שבוע ראשון או בסוף שבוע שני – as for example, a discoloration like the size of Cilician bean which does not have in it a patch of un-discolored flesh or white hair and he (i.e., the Kohen) shut him in isolation, if it spread at the end of the first week or it didn’t spread other than at the end of the second week, he (i.e., the Kohen) declares him to be a leper. But if it did not spread neither in the first week or in the second week, and he released/cleared him, but after a couple of days it spread, he (i.e., the Kohen) declares him to be a leper.
להחליט את ההופך כולו לבן מתוך הפטור – if after he was released/cleared and the Kohen purified him, the leprosy spread throughout his body, he is impure and irrevocably confirmed as a leper.
לפטור את ההופך כולו לבן מתוך החלט או מתוך הסגר – if after the Kohen declared him impure, or after it was necessary to be shut him in isolation prior to his being made impure, and the leprosy spread throughout his body, he releases him and he is pure, for the white eruption which causes the leper to be declared clean changes someone from pure to impure and from the impure to the pure. And it is called an impure leper under trial [pending the priest’s observation – see Leviticus 13:4).
אלו מראות נגעים – these four appearances that we mentioned, smooth or variegated.

Mishnah 4

מראות נגעים שלשים וששה – and we don’t have the reading: "מראות נגעים ששה עשר" /”The appearances of plagues are sixteen. But there were thirty six, four appearances that are smooth and four appearances that are variegated of the skin of his body, and corresponding to them, with שחין/inflammation (or boil, skin-disease) and מכוה/a burnt spot on the skin, for the inflammation and the burnt spot are one, and Scripture did not divide them other than to tell you that they do not combine, and corresponding to them with the נתקים/bald (blanched) spot on the head or in the beard, and corresponding to them with קרחת/a leprous affection on the back of the head (making it bald) and גבחת/a leprous affection on the front of the head (making it bald), and ירקרק/pale-colored/greenish andאדמדם /reddish leprosy (see Leviticus 13:42), that are the plagues of houses, these are thirty-six.
עקביא בן מחללאל אומר שבעים ושתים – these thirty-six at the outset when he (i.e., the potential leper) is brought to the Kohen, and thirty-six others corresponding to the end of the first week or the end of the second week of isolation or the end of the third week for plagues upon houses to distinguish between appearances [of plagues] ab initio to an appearance at the end, these are seventy-two. Maimonides explained them thusly, and he is sound/upright. But what is difficult to me about this is that he counts eight appearances of bald (blanched) spots on the head or in the beard, but we hold that bald (blanched spots on the head or in the beard defile in all appearances [of plagues] and they lack special appearances like the rest of the plagues.
ששבוע שני שלו חל בשבת – for two isolations, are thirteen days. For the seventh day of the first week counts for this week and the other [week], as it is written (Leviticus 13:5): "והסגירו [הכהן] שבעת ימים שנית"/ “the priest shall isolate him for another seven days.”, which teaches that the seventh day counts for him from the number from before it and from after it. And similarly, the three weeks of plagues on houses are not other than nineteen days, for the first and seventh [days] of the middle week count before them and after them.
חל להיות בתוך השבת – that on the Sabbath days falls the seventh day, we don’t see him (i.e., examine him) on the Sabbath, because it appears like adjudication is taking place on the Sabbath day, but we delay it until after the Sabbath. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Akiba.

Mishnah 5

היה בו שער לבן – on the Sabbath day. And if he (i.e., the Kohen) had seen him, he would have declared him to be a leper, but after the Sabbath, the white hair disappeared, and this is ruling leniently. But even though that he (i.e., the Kohen) declared him to be a leper on the Sabbath day, when it (i.e., the white hair) left him after the Sabbath, he would have declared him pure, nevertheless, he would have to bring a sacrifice, according to the law of a מצורע מוחלט/confirmed leper – who has been declared conclusively ritually impure by a Kohen (A confirmed leper must grow his hair long and rend his garments) who became healed, but now is exempt.
היו לבנות – alternatively, if his hair was white on the Sabbath day that he would have been designated to have been declared a confirmed leper, and on the morrow (i.e., Sunday), [his hair] blackened, this is ruling leniently.
אחת לבנה ואחת שחורה והשחירו שניהן – he just refers to it by the way/without specific reason, for here one cannot be lenient, and whether it was white [and turned black] or had been black all along, he is ritually pure. But subsidiary to this/on account of, [as] the concluding clause [of the Mishnah] is stringent (see Mishnah 6), it (i.e., the Mishnah) took this term as it teaches, "ולהבינו"/and they became white – in both [clauses].
ארוכות – his hair was [long] on the Sabbath day in order to cut it with scissors, that is the measure of defilement. On the morrow, they will be shortened, which is to be lenient.
אחת ארוכה ואחת קצרה – he just refers to it by the way/without specific reason, for either way (i.e., whether is hair is short or long) is a pure. But on account of the concluding clause [of the Mishnah] that is to be stringent (see Mishnah 6), it (i.e., the Mishnah) took the phrase and taught: "והאריכו"/and they became longer, in both [clauses].
נסמך השחין (if the inflammation/boil was attached) – to two hairs, after the Sabbath, but on the Sabbath he did not have a boil/inflammation on it, for had he (i.e., the Kohen) seen it on the Sabbath, he would declare him to be a leper on account of the white hairs that are within the bright white spot on the skin/בהרת, and now after the Sabbath when the boil comes and is attached to the two of them (i.e., hairs) or to one of them, is not a sign of defilement.
הקיף השחין וכו' – or that the boil surrounded the two white hairs.
או לאחת מהן או חלקן השחין – that the boil comes of the raw flesh of the boil or the burnt spot on the skin or the raw flesh of the burnt spot on the skin or the white scurf/בוהק between each hair. All of these on Shabbat are not there but after Shabbat came (i.e., appeared), this is a leniency.
היתה בו מחיה (if there was in it raw flesh) – on the Sabbath, which is a sign of defilement, and it went away after the Sabbath. Alternatively, it was quadrilateral on the Sabbath, and he was worthy of being declared a leper, but after Shabbat it became round or long, that now it is not a sign of defilement. Alternatively, an eruption was surrounded with raw flesh in the middle of the bright white spot on the skin/בהרת, like a kind of a fortress of a city that sits in the middle of the city, and through this, he was worthy of being declared a leper, but after Shabbat, it was made from the side. Alternatively, it was gathered/collected like a lentil in one place, but after Shabbat, it scattered.
ובא השחין ונכנס לתוכו – meaning to say, that on Shabbat there was no boil there, but the raw flesh was a sign of defilement, and the boil came and entered into it.
הקיפה או חלקה או מיעטה – meaning to say, or that the boil didn’t come on the entire plague but only on a part of the raw flesh, and became diminished from being like a lentil.
השחין ומחית השחין המכוה ומחית המכוה והבהק (the boil, the raw flesh of the boil, the burning and the raw flesh of the burning and the white scurf/tetter) – all of these exist for being diminished, for the boil was lessened or the raw flesh of the boil, that is, that a membrane was made like the shell of the garlic. Or the burnt spot on the skin or the raw flesh of the burnt spot on the skin. All of these that on the Sabbath were not there, but after the Sabbath came. And similarly, the white scurf/בוהק, that on the Sabbath were from the four appearances [of plagues] and on the morrow (i.e., Sunday), it became white scurf and the raw flesh lessened, for boils and white scurf lessen the raw flesh, as is taught in Torat Kohanim (i.e., Sifra, the Midrash Halakha on Leviticus): “living flesh,” (see Leviticus 13:14: “But as soon as un-discolored flesh appears in it, he shall be impure”/"וביום הראות בו בשר חי יטמא"), but not boils; “living flesh,” but not white scurf.
היה לו פסיון (if he had the spreading of a leprous spot) – on Shabbat.
והלך לו הפסיון – after Shabbat, for what spread on Shabbat was gathered in on the morrow (i.e., Sunday).
או שהלכה האום (or that the original leprosy- substance had disappeared) – the essence of the plague is called the אום/original leprosy, the original leprosy had disappeared and there remained the leprous spot, or that the original leprosy substance had become reduced , and there isn’t between them like the size of a Cilician bean.
השחין ומחית השחין – meaning to say, alternatively, on Shabbat it spread but did not stop on Shabbat between the original leprosy substance and the leprous spot neither the boils nor the raw flesh of the boils nor the burnt spot on the skin nor the raw flesh of the skin nor the white scurf, but after the Sabbath, one of these stopped, this is its leniency.

Mishnah 6

נסמך השחין – on Shabbat [the boil joined]
לשתיהן – to the wo hairs, for now it Is not a sign of defilement, for the white hair is no a sign of defilement other than when it touches itself not within the boil or within the burnt spot on the skin.
אף הקיף השחין וכו' (even if the boil surrounded) – for if he (i.e., the Kohen) saw it on the Sabbath, he would not declare him to be a leper.
והלכו להן – and after the Sabbath [they went away], for the place of the boil and the burnt spot on the skin became a rough, scabby surface/scar, and it is like the skin of the body. And when he (i.e., the Kohen) declares him to be a confirmed leper, this is to be ruling strictly.
חולקין בין האום לפסיון ([the tetters/white scurf] divides between the starting point of leprosy and the spreading of the leprous spot) – that they would sop on Shabbat between the essence of the plague and the spreading.
והלכו להן – after the Sabbath, and here is nothing that stops/interrupts it, these are for ruling strictly.

Chapter 2



Mishnah 1

בהרת. גרמוני (an intensely white bright spot appears faint on the skin of a Germanus – Teuton) – the most white. And the intensely bright spot that sparkles like snow appears on him faint as a result of the great whiteness that is on his skin, and they release him.
והכהה – appears. בכושי עזה ([the faint spot] appears bright on a Cushite) – as a result of the fact that his skin is black. And they lock up/isolate the leper [pending examination by a Kohen]. For we follow after how his skin appears.
בית ישראל אני כפרתן – as a result of his love for them, he would say, “I am their atonement.” Meaning to say that all the punishment that is appropriate to come upon them I accept upon myself in order to atone for them. For they are “intermediate” and placed in the middle and do not lean to one of the two extreme ends.
לא לבנים ולא שחורים – but rather like boxwood/ebony which is neither white nor black (but of an intermediate color). [The word] אשכרוע, is a species of cedar, BOSHU in the foreign language. (Isaiah 41:19): “[I will plant cedars in the wilderness, acacias and myrtles and oleasters; I will set cypresses in the desert,] box trees and elms as well,” אשכרוע –boxwood. And Rabbi Yishmael holds that he would declare one [person] pure, he would declare all of them pure, and just as he would defile one [person], he would defile all of them. And Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva share the same approach.
ציירין – artists that paint shapes for beauty.
כבינוני – an intermediate paint/color
מראות נגעים להקל (the appearance/colors of plagues are meant to produce a lenient decision) -And the reason of Rabbi Yehuda is explained in Torat Kohanim/Sifra. One verse states (Leviticus 13:2): “And it develops into a scaly affection on the skin of his body”/ "והיה בעור-בשרו לנגע צרעת" and another verse states (Leviticus 13:3): “The priest shall examine the affection on the skin of his body”/"וראה הכהן את-הנגע בעור-הבשר" (i.e., note that one verse states "בעור בשרו" and the next verse states "בעור הבשר"), we found that appearances of plagues are meant to produce lenient decisions but not to produce stringent/rigorous ones. How so? Let the German/Teuton be examined with his skin (which is faint) to be lenient, he fulfills [the verse]: "בעור בשרו"/ “on the skin of his body" (Leviticus 13:2) and the Cushite [be examined] as an intermediate to be lenient, is found that he fulfills [the verse]:"בעור הבשר" / “on the skin of his body.”
זה וזה כבינוני – The German/Teuton and the Cushite are seen as intermediate, which is [the opinion] of Rabbi Akiva.

Mishnah 2

אין רואין את הנגעים בשחרית ובין הערבים וכו' – that we derive it from Scripture, as it is written (Leviticus 13:12): “wherever the priest can see”/"לכל-מראה עיני הכהן" – what the Kohen who is lacking in his eye-sight that he cannot see the plagues, even a day which is lacking its light, we don’t see in him he plagues.
רבי יהודה אומר בד' בה' כו' – and the Halakha is according to Rabbi Yehuda.

Mishnah 3

אין פותחין לו חלונות – as it is written (Leviticus 14:35): “Something like a plague has appeared [upon my house]”/"כנגע נראה לי [בבית]" – to me but not to my light (i.e., the Lord’s light), from here they (i.e., the Sages) said: In a dark house, they don’t open for him the windows.

Mishnah 4

כעודר וכמוסק (in the position of one hoeing and taking olives down) – it is the manner of one who hoes who pauses his feet and it is the manner one taking olives down who lifts his arms (to examine the arm-pit). עודר/hoes, digs in the ground. מוסק/gleans his olives.
כעורכת (who works the dough) – the bread when she pauses her feet.
וכמניקה את בנה – regarding the matter of under her breast, for what it appears at that time is not considered the covered parts of the body/posteriors.
כעורגת בעומדים לשחי ([a woman is placed] in the position of a weaker at an upright loom – for the sake of examining the pit of the right arm) – that she raises her right hand and reveals the duct of her arm-pit.
כטווה בפשתן (that she spins flax) – for is the manner of a person who spins [flax] to raise her left hand and she reveals the duct of her arm-pit. What it does not appear in this, is that it is considered the posterior/the covered parts of the body. And it is written (Leviticus 13:12): “wherever the priest can see”/"לכל-מראה איני הכהן", excluding the posterior/covered parts of the body.
לתגלחתו – on the day of his purity. And he needs to shave, as it is written (Leviticus 14:9): “[On the seventh day he shall shave off all his hair - ] of head, beard and eyebrows,” just as these are the places of the entrance of hair and appears, even every place hat is the entrance of hair and appears, except for the covered parts of the body/posteriors.

Mishnah 5

רבי מאיר אומר אף לא נגעי קרוביו – there is an analogy made between plagues and quarrels, as it is written (Deuteronomy 21:5: “[The priests, sons of Levi, shall come forward; for the LORD your God has chosen them to minister to Him and pronounce blessing in the name of the LORD,] and every lawsuit and case of assault is subject to their ruling”/"ועל-פיהם יהיה כל-ריב וכל-נגע" . Just as lawsuits are not with relatives, so also plagues are not with relatives. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Meir.
חוץ מנדרי עצמו – as it is written (Numbers 30:3): “he shall not break his pledge.” He cannot remit/pardon but others can pardon him.
אף לא נדרי אשתו שבינה לבין אחרים – as for example, vows which are not of afflictions of the soul and matters that are not between him (i.e., the husband) and her, that they required the investigation of a Sage, for lest he be lenient concerning his wife and not examine her well, and specifically on his own for he is not able to release [someone from a vow] and even if he is singular specialist [in Jewish law], but he combines/joins in a group of three commoners, for since there is a panel of three, they are not suspected lest they don’t examine/cross-examine well.
כל הבכורות אדם רואה – if they are able to eat them with their blemishes.

Chapter 3



Mishnah 1

הכל מיטמאין (all are made unclean) – and even a minor. For you might have thought that (Leviticus 13:44): “The man is leprous.”/"איש-צרוע", it comes to teach us that, as it is written (Leviticus 13:2): “[When a person has] on the skin of his body.”
הכל כשרים לראות את הנגעים – and even though he is not an expert in them and in their names/designations, if a Sage is with him, he may examine, but on his own if he is not an expert in them and in their names/designations, he doesn’t examine the plagues.
שהטומאה והטהרה ביד כהן – an Israelite Sage examines the plagues and says to the Kohen, even though he is an imbecile/שוטה, “Say, ‘unclean/impure’” [or] “Say, “pure/clean’”.
בין איש אחד בין בשני אנשים – that there appeared two plagues on one person or on two people, a Kohen does not examine [both of] them at the same time, for the Kohen is not able to see well two plagues as [he sees] one.
ומסגירו – if he is locking up (i.e., isolating) a [presumed] leper for trial, such as through the four appearances of plagues (see Tractate Negaim, Chapter 1, Mishnah 1).
ומחליטו – if he is worthy for being declared a [certified] leper, such as through white hair or a half-healed (having only a thin covering).
ופוטרו – if he is below from four appearances [of plagues].
וחוזר לשני – after the second person [had plagues] that appeared prior to his isolating/shutting in the first or declaring him to be a certified leper.
אין מסגירים את המוסגר – and similarly, we also do not declare someone to be a certified leper who is in isolation/shut up. For if they isolated him with one plague and afterwards another plaque appeared to him after it was fit to isolate him or declare him to be a certified leper, he does not engage with him. For if he is isolated/shut up from the first [plague], there is nothing regarding the second plague, neither the designation of being locked up [pending the priest’s observation – see Leviticus 13:4] or from the designation of being declared a confirmed leper, until he will need him (i.e., the Kohen).
אבל בתחלה בסוף שבוע מסגיר ומסגיר – if at the beginning of the week, a second [plague] appeared prior to his being isolated/shut up for the first [plague], he shuts him up/isolates him over the first [plague] and shuts him up/isolates him over the second [plague]. And similarly, at the end of the first week, if the first [plague] remained unchanged, he shuts him up/isolates him and goes back and shuts him up/isolates him on the second plague.
מחליט ומחליט – he declares him a certified leper on the first [plague] and goes back and declares him a certified leper on the second [plague].
מסגיר ופוטר – he (i.e., the Kohen) isolates him/shuts him up on the first [plague] but releases him on the second [plague].
מחליט ופוטר – he declares him a certified leper on the first [plague] and releases him on the second [plague]. And the same law applies in the opposite direction, he (i.e., the Kohen) shuts him up/isolates him [for the first plague] and declares him to be a certified leper [for the second plague] or declares him to be a certified leper [for the first plague] and shuts him up/puts him in isolation for the second plague or releases him [for the first plague] and isolates him/shuts him up [for the second plague] or shuts him up/isolates him for the first plague and declares him to be a certified leper [for the second plague].

Mishnah 2

נותנין לו שבעת ימי המשתה – as it is written (Leviticus 13:14): “But as soon as ]un-discolored flesh] appears in it”/"וביום הראות בו [בשר חי]" since the All-Merciful (i.e., God) writes "ובהראות"/”as it appears”, what is "וביום"/as soon as? To inform you that there is a day that you examine and there is a day that you don’t examine.

Mishnah 3

עור הבשר – that appeared upon it one from the four appearances of plagues (see Tractate Negaim, Chapter 1, Mishnah 1).
בתחילה – when he is brought before the Kohen without locking up the leper for trial, he becomes defiled through white hair and through raw flesh. But regarding spreading of a leprous spot he does not become defiled until the end of the first week, or the end of the second week, or after the release at the end of the second week when it remained unchanged and he was released, if after this it spread, he (i.e., the Kohen) goes back and declares him a certified leper.
שלשה עשר יום – that the seventh day of the first week counts for here (i.e., the first week) and there (i.e., the second week).

Mishnah 4

השחין המכוה מטמאים בשבוע אחד – for the rest of the plagues have two locking-ups, but if it did not spread during the first week, and a white hair did not appear, he releases him. And the language of מיטמאין/made unclean/impure that it (i.e., the Mishnah) uses, this is what he (i.e., the Mishnah) said: When these two tokens/signs came at the end of one week, but if they didn’t come, he is pure/clean.

Mishnah 5

הנתקים (bald/blanched spot on the head or on the beard) – plagues that are on the head or on the beard are called נתקים.
בשער צהוב דק בתחלה (with thin golden hair at the beginning) – if at the beginning golden hair appeared on him, he (i.e., the Kohen) declares him to be a certified leper.
צהוב – similar to gold.
בסוף שבוע ראשון ובסוף שבוע שני – if at the end of the first week it spread or their appeared on him golden hair, he (i.e., the Kohen) declares him to be a certified leper. But if not, he isolates him/shuts him up, for the second [week], but if at the end of the second week it spreads, or golden hair appears, he (i.e., the Kohen) declares him to be a certified leper. But if not, he releases him. But if after the release, it spread, or golden hair appears, he (i.e., the Kohen) declares him to be a certified leper.

Mishnah 6

הקרחת והבדחת – further ahead in chapter 10 [Tractate Negaim, Mishnah 10], it (i.e., the Mishnah) explains what is leprous affection on the ack of the head and what is baldness on the forehead.
במחיה ובפסיון (with quick/raw flesh and spreading) – but with white hair, they do not defile, because no hair grows in them.

Mishnah 7

בירקרק ובאדמדם (pale-colored/greenish and reddish leprosy) – But this is what happens in clothing and houses as a sign/symbol of greenish or reddish defilement. But they don’t call above the sign of defilement for the four appearances of plagues that are in the skin of the body, because the four appearances that are in the skin of the body even if they remain unchanged several years, they (i.e., the Kohanim) do not declare someone to be a certified leper without white hair and without spreading and without a thin covering [of healing], but with clothing, when the greenish/pale-covered leprosy or reddish leprosy remained for two weeks even though it did not spread, it is written (Leviticus 13:55): “[And if, after the affected article has been washed, the priest sees that the affection has not changed color and that it has not spread, it is impure.] It shall be consumed in fire”/"באש תשרפנו" , for this reason, they call them with regard to clothing a sign of defilement. And similar with houses for three weeks, when the plague returns to like the way it was, either from greenish to reddish or from reddish to greenish, it is written (Leviticus 14:45): “The house shall be tone down/ונתץ את הבית,” as if it it spread. For this reason, we called them a sign of defilement.
לאחר הפטור – as for example, that it became faint, if it returned afterwards one burns it.

Mishnah 8

שהם שתעה עשר יום – the first and seventh [days] of the middle week count for before them and after them.
פחות משבוע אחד – such as boils and the burnt spot on the skin.
שלשה שבועות – as for example, plagues on houses.

Chapter 4



Mishnah 1

יש בשער. ששער לבן מטמא בתחילה – when it is brought to the Kohen [for inspection] and there is in the plague a white hair, it is impure. What is not the case regarding spreading of a leprous spot which does not defile other than at the end of a week.
ומטמא בכל מראה לובן (and defiles in any appearance of the white color [of leprosy] – even below/less from four appearances, as it is written (Leviticus 13:3): "ומראה הנגע עמוק"/“and the affection appears to be deeper than [the skin of his body, it is a leprous affection],” the appearance of the plague is deeper, but the appearance of white hair does not appear to be deep. Which is not the case with spreading of the plague/פסיון, for the spreading does not defile below/less than four appearances, for in those appearances that the starting point of leprosy/the substance defiles, the spreading of a leprous spot defiles.
ואין בו סימן טהרה (no token of cleanness applies to it) – whereas with the spreading of a leprous spot there is a token of cleanness that applies to it, for if it spread all over, it is pure.
מטמא בכל שהוא – but the white hair does not defile with less than two hairs, for the least of hair is two.
חוץ מן הנגע – that when it spread outside of the plague, it is impure But regarding the white hair we require that it be in the plague, as it is written (Leviticus 13:3): "ושער בנגע הפך לבן"/“if hair in the affected patch turned white.”

Mishnah 2

בכל מראה – that is like the appearance of the flesh whether abnormally dark-complexioned whether white or whether red.
מטמא בכל שהוא – but with quick flesh it requires like a lentil.
חוץ מן הנגע מה שאין כן במחיה – for the quick flesh needs to be within the plague.

Mishnah 3

ובמכונס (are close together) – that they two hairs are in one place in the plague.
במפורד – this one on the east side of the plague and that one on the west side.
מבוצר (encompassed) – two hairs in the middle of the plague, like a fortress that is in the middle of the city.
אינו מבוצר – like a thread that comes out from the plague, and there is in its midst two hairs, what is not the case with the burning spot that we require [both] encompassed and close together.
הפוכה ושלא הפוכה (whether it was changed or not changed) – whether the bright white spot on the skin preceded the quick flesh , or whether the quick flesh preceded the bright white spot on the skin/בהרת. What is not the case concerning the white hair, for if it (i.e., the white hair) preceded the bright white spot on the skin, he is pure.
מעכבת את ההופך כולו לבן (hinders [uncleanness] in him who has turned entirely white) – if he was declared a definite leper with quick flesh, and the leprosy blossomed throughout him except for the place of the quick flesh, he is still impure. But if it blossomed throughout even though all of his hair is filled with white hair, he is pure, for the white hair does not hinder (i.e., is not indispensable).

Mishnah 4

עיקרן משחיר וראשן מלבין טהור – as Scripture states (Leviticus 13:3): “if hair in the affected patch has turned white”/"ושער בנגע הפך לבן", the root hat is adjacent to/near the plague has turned white. -
כדי לקרוץ בזוג (sufficient to cut with scissors) – sufficient that he should take with the mouth of a pair of scissors. And the Halakha the measure of white hair, its length is not less than that he should take with the mouth of a scissors, but the whiteness that is in it is any amount at all.
ונראית כשתים טהור – that thee are hairs that are divided at their top into two but at their root they are not other than one.
בהרת ובה שער לבן ושער שחור טמא – a bright white spot on the skin that is like the size of a pressed [Cilician] bean and it has two white hairs, but the rest is filled with black hairs, it is impure. But we don’t say that the place of the black hairs limits the bright white spot on the skin from being like a split [Cilician] bean.

Mishnah 5

זוקקה לשער לבן ולפסיון (if [the streak/thread] subjects it [the bright spot] to [restrictions in respect to] white hair and spreading) – if there is in that thread a white hair, he is declared to be a definitive leper. Or if it spread near the thread at the end of a week, he is impure. But if there isn’t in the width of the thread two hairs but it has white hair he does not defile, for it is not considered from the plague. But if it spread near the thread and there isn’t in its width two hairs, it is considered like spreading far from the plague, and it requires like a split [Cilician] bean.
אבל לא למחיה – that even if here is in the width of the thread of two hairs, the quick flesh that is on it does not defile. For the quick flesh needs that will be encompassed in the middle of the plague like a fortress which is in the middle of the city.
מצרפן – and they are judged as one plague. But if one of them spread a little bit or a white hair was forthcoming on one of them, he is declared to be a definitive leper on both of them.
ואם לאו אימנן מצרפן – and they are judged as two plagues, but if one of them spread but the other one did not spread, he is declared to be a definitive leper on the one, and is shut up/isolated on the other. And the practical difference is that when he is declared to be pure, he is required to bring two sacrifices.

Mishnah 6

בהרת כגריס – but not the place of the quick flesh, that is nine lentils of the bright white spot on the skin, and one lentil of quick flesh, ten lentils among them all.
גריס – they are nine lentils, and the quick flesh is not less than a lentil. Wherever that we teach בהרת/the bright white spot on the skin (i.e., eventually one of the symptoms of leprosy), the same law applies to the rest of the appearances that are smooth or variegated.
והלכה המחיה – that the plague comes upon its place.
הלך שער לבן – that it fell off or changed to black/dark.
ר' שמעון מטהר – it refers to the quick flesh that disappeared.
שלא הפכתו בהרת – that the white hair preceded the bright white spot on the skin of the place of the quick flesh.
שלא הפכתו בהרת כגריס – that the white hair preceded the bright white spot on the skin like a split Cilician bean, for the place of the quick flesh was missing that of a Cilician bean, and here also, Rabbi Shimon does not dispute other than when the quick flesh disappears. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Shimon.

Mishnah 7

בהרת ובה מחיה ופשיון – a bright white spot on the skin (i.e., eventually one of the symptoms of leprosy) like a split Cilician bean and he has been shut in/put in isolation, and at the end of the week, he found in it the quick flesh and spreading and they declared him to be a certified leper.
הלכה המחיה (the quick flesh disappeared – after a week of quarantine)– as for example, that the plague came upon, the bright white spot on the skin is impure because of the spreading.
הלך הפשיון – as for example, that the bright white spot on the skin/בהרת came in and it returned to the size of a Cilician bean.
וכן שער לבן ופשיון – if one of them disappeared, he is impure because of the second.
הלכה וחזרה בסוף השבוע – as for example, that he was shut up/isolated on account of the bright white spot on the skin like the size of a split Cilician bean, and the bright white spot on the skin went away in the middle of the week, but at the end of the week it returned.
הרי היא כמות שהיתה – and they shut him up/isolated him a second time.
לאחר הפטור – that the Kohen saw it (i.e., the bright white spot on the skin) at the end of the week and when it disappeared, he released him, if after that it returned, it would appear at the beginning. ( And this return – that is in its first (i.e., original) place, for if it was in in another place, if so this is another bright spot on the skin.
היתה עזה – like snow when he shut him up/isolated him.
ונעשית כהה – at the end of the first week, as for example, like lime or with a membrane, or that it was like a membrane at the time of his being shut up/put in isolation, and it became strong like snow at the end of the first week.
הרי היא כמות שהיתה – and it requires a second isolation, like “it has remained unchanged”/"עמד בעיניו" (Leviticus 13:5).
ובלבד שלא תתמעט מארבע מראות (on condition that it did not diminish [to a shade less] than the four appearances – if it diminished from the four appearances, he (i.e., the Kohen) releases him immediately and he is pure.
כנסה ופשתה (if it contracted and spread) – where he was shut up/placed in isolation with the bright white spot on the skin like a split Cilician bean, and at the end of he week, it contracted, but after that it spread the place in the place of the contraction but not more. Or that it spread at the end of the week, and afterwards contracted the place of the spreading and not more.
ר' עקיבא מטמא – for it certainly spread.
וחכמים מטהרים – that this is not spreading, but it is as it was. But if it refers to the end of the first week, they shut him up/isolate him a second time. But if it refers to the end of the second week, they release him and he is ritually pure.

Mishnah 8

ופשתה כחצי גריס – to the eastern side.
והלך מן האום כחצי גריס – to the western side.
תיראה בתחלה (it is inspected anew) – for it is considered like another plague, and it is a new plague and he should be shut up/isolated [for it].
וחכמים מאהרין – that it is not considered spreading unless it adds on the measurement of the plaque that it was at the outset, but this now is none other than like a split Cilician bean, it is considered like the first that remained unchanged and is pure.

Mishnah 9

ופשתה כחצי גריס ועוד וכו'. רבי עקיבא מטמא – because the “and more”/"ועוד" that remains there from the spreading. And we are speaking about that it spread after the clearance/release.
וחכמים מטהרין – for since it went one-half of a split Cilician bean from the starting point of leprosy, it is not from a new plague but rather one-half of a split Cilician bean and more.
ופשתה כגריס ועוד – after the release [from uncleanness], and afterwards, the starting point of leprosy disappeared and there didn’t remain anything other than the new split Cilician bean and [a bit] more.
רבי עקיבא מטמא – for it spread for him from the first measurement. But the Rabbis hold, since it went on [further], the first is all of it, but this plague that is referred to is new, that it should be inspected anew and he should be shut up/isolated.

Mishnah 10

בהרת כגריס ופשתה כגריס – we are speaking that it spread after the clearance/release [from impurity].
ר' עקיבא מטמא – for there is here a plague and the sign of defilement with it.
תיראה בתחלה – for even though that it should be examined anew, the Kohen should also declare it impure immediately. And the quick flesh and white hair defile at the beginning, nevertheless, the practical difference is that according to the Rabbis, he needs to bring a sacrifice for each and every one, but according to Rabbi Akiba it is considered like the first plague, and when it (i.e., the plague) falls away, he brings one sacrifice. And in all of these where Rabbi Akiba and the Sages disagree in our Mishnah, the Halakha is according to the Sages.
ואין בה כלום – it has no white hair.
ובה שערה אחת ונולדה בהרת וכו' הרי זו להסגיר – and even though the bright white spot in the flesh like a Cilician bean came first to the last hair, since it didn’t come before the first [hair], it has no effect, for we require that the bright white spot in the flesh precedes like a split Ciliican bean to the two hairs.
בהרת כחצי גריס ובה שתי שערות וכו' הרי זו להסגיר – and even though the one-half Cilician bean preceded the two hairs, it has no effect until the full split Cilician bean precedes the two hairs.

Mishnah 11

ונולד בהרת כחצי גריס ובה שתי שערות כו' הרי זו להחלט – wherever it teaches [in the Mishnah]: "ובה שתי שערות"/ “and in it are two hairs” or "ובה שערה אחת" / “and in it is one hair”, it is not that the hairs and ""the bright white spot in the flesh/בהרת that come together, but rather, that the bright white spot in the flesh came first and afterwards came the hairs.
ואם שער לבן קדמה לבהרת טהור – as it is written (Leviticus 13:10): "[וראה הכהן והנה שאת-לבנה בעור] והיא הפכה שער לבן [ומחית בשר חי בשאת]."/ “[If the priest finds on the skin a white swelling] which has turned some hair white, [with a patch of un-discolored flesh in the swelling],” it is the bright white spot in the flesh which caused the hair to turn to a white color.
ספק טמא – there is doubt if the white hair preceded the bright white spot in the flesh/בהרת or that the bright white spot in the flesh preceded the white hair, it is impure.
ורבי יהושע קהה – we have the reading. From the language of (Jeremiah 31:29): “[In those days, they shall no longer say, ‘Parents have eaten sour grapes] and children’s teeth are blunted.”/"ושני בנים תקהינה". Meaning to say, that his teeth were blunted from stating the words that it is doubtfully impure, for he held that it is doubtfully pure. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Yehoshua.

Chapter 5



Mishnah 1

כל ספק נגעים חוץ מזה – [this relates to Chapter 4, Mishnah 11 towards the end of the Mishnah] – that the doubt regarding the bright white spot in the flesh preceded [or] the doubt about whether the white hair preceded.
הרי היא כסלע – it became as wide and as large as a Sela.
ספק היא היא – and it is worthy/fit [for the person] to be declared a certified leper, for it spread.
ספק שאחרת באה תחתיה – that the first went away/disappeared and he is fit to be shut up/isolated, for spreading does not defile at the outset.
ומחליטו – and he declares him to be a certified leper.

Mishnah 2

הלך שער לבן – that he had been certified as a leper for its sake [of the white hair].
וחזר שער לבן – other in its place.
וכן במחיה וכן בפשיון – or that the white hair did not return, but rather that quick flesh resulted which is also a sign of defilement, or that the plague spread.
בתחילה בסוף שבוע ראשון – that is to say, whether the declaration of being a certified leper had been at the outset when he was brought to the Kohen, whether at the end of the first week, whether at the end of the second week, whether after the clearance/release, as for example, that it remained unchanged/עמד בעיניו for two weeks and he released him, and after the release, the white hair came and he (i.e., the Kohen) declared him to be a certified leper, in all of these ways if the white hair disappeared and then the white hair returned, or the quick flesh or the spreading. הרי היא כמות שהיתה – that is to say, the defilement remained like it was, for since he has a sign of defilement, even though this is not the same sign that he had at the time of the declaration as a certified leper.
וחזר הפשיון וכן בשער לבן – but that it (i.e., the Mishnah) doesn’t teach, "וכן המחיה"/and similarly the quick flesh, because when the spreading disappeared and the quick flesh came, sometimes he would be pure, as for example, that the quick flesh diminished the plague from being the size of a split Cilician bean.

Mishnah 3

שער פקודה (hair of a leprous spot which remains after the inflammation has partly receded) – it is language of פקדון/deposit (see Leviticus 5:21 and 5:23), that the bright white spot in the flesh/בהרת deposited the hair in the skin of the flesh and left it/disappeared.
וחכמים מטהרים – and their reasoning, as it is written (Leviticus 13:10): “[If the priest finds on the skin a white swelling] which has turned some hair white, [with a patch of un-discolored flesh in the swelling].”/"והיא הפכה [שער לבן ומחית בשר חי בשאת]., that it has turned [some hair white], but it did not turn its neighboring [hair white].
אף דבריך אין מקויימין – for this also is pure. And the Halakha is according to the Sages.

Mishnah 4

בין אישר אחד – even though that which ever you turn, he has one bright white spot in the flesh that has spread, that which at its outset was like a split Cilician bean and now is like a Sela, he is fit to be declared a certified leper, nevertheless, since he (i.e., the Kohen) doesn’t know on which plague is declaring him to be a certified leper, he (i.e., the person) is pure, from the decree of the Scriptural verse, as it is written (Leviticus 13:22): “If it should spread in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him impure; [it is an affection],” the definitive plague he declares impure, but he doesn’t declare impure but he doesn’t defile the plague where he has doubt.
בין בשני אנשים – even though that one of them requires being shut up/isolated for seven days a second time at the end of the first week, and the other is a certified leper, but sine he doesn’t know which to shut up and which to declare a certified leper, both of them are pure from the decree from the Scriptural verse.
ר' עקיבא אומר כו' – but the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Akiba.

Mishnah 5

אף על פי שחזרו להיות כסלע – for now one of them is ritually pure, but since they were obliged to regard themselves/obligate themselves for defilement, both of them are impure, as it is written (Leviticus 13:23): “[But if the discoloration remains stationary, not having spread, it is the scar of the inflammation] the priest shall declare him pure”/"וטהרו הכהן" - that which is definitive, he (i.e., the Kohen) declares pure, but he does not declare pure the doubtful (see also Sifra on his verse in Leviticus).
עד שיחזרו להיות גריס – that now, certainly both of them are ritually pure, that the spreading that on whose account they were declared to be certified lepers has disappeared from both of them.

Chapter 6



Mishnah 1

גופה של בהרת – a split bean.
הקלקי (Cilician) – the name of a place. And he beans that are there are large.
מרובע – this is the measure that is defined exactly that is in the bright white spot in the skin. But if the plague was round or in another form, if it has within it in order that the plague like the split Cilician squared bean can enter, it is impure, and if it not, it is pure.

Mishnah 2

רבתה הבהרת – from the outside.
טמאה – because of spreading.
נתמעטה טהורה – for it lacks like [the size of] a split bean.
רבתה הבהרת – and the bright white spot in the flesh/בהרת entered in.
טהורה – for the quick flesh does not diminish. For we require that the bright white spot in the flesh is like a lentil on each side surrounding the quick flesh.

Mishnah 3

רבתה הבהרת – from the outside.
טמאה – for it (i.e., the bright white spot in the flesh) spread in the flesh.
נתמעטה טהורה – and even if the quick flesh was like a lentil [in size].
רבתה המחיה – and it became like a lentil, it is impure.
מתמעטה – that the bright white spot in the flesh spread upon it.
ר' מאיר מטמא – for he considers spreading from the inside like from the outside.
וחכמים מטהרים – for spreading that is on the inside is not considered spreading. And the Halakha is according to the Sages.

Mishnah 4

שלא יתמעטו מכשיעור – a bright white spot on the skin/בהרת from like a split Cilician bean [in size] and quick flesh/מחיה from like a lentil.

Mishnah 5

בהרת כגריס – squared and a strip of living flesh in the width of like a lentil surrounding it from around, and except for that living flesh that surrounds the bright white spot on the skin like a split Cilician bean from around. For here there are two bright white spots on the skin, one inner and one outer, and the quick flesh interrupts between them all around.
הפנימית להסגיר – for there is no quick flesh in its middle.
והחיצונה להחליט – for the quick flesh that surrounds the inner [bright white spot on the skin] is a sign/token of defilement for the outer [bright white spot on the skin] for it is surrounded in its middle.
שהבהרת בתוכה – because the bright white spot on the skin is within it, it is not considered a sign/token of defilement to the outer [bright white spot on the skin], since we require it being surrounded, a plague from here and a plague from there with quick flesh in the middle [without an interruption of something else within the quick flesh), but here, there is a plague and quick flesh and a plague and quick flesh and a plague. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Yossi.
נתמעטה המחיה – that the bright white spot on the skin spread upon it.
והלכה לה – or it went away/disappeared completely.
אם מבפנים היא כלתה – that the bright white spot on the skin covered the quick flesh.
סימן פשיון לפנימית – and it is declared definitive leprosy, for it spread from the outside.


והחיצונה טהורה – that its quick flesh diminished or went away, and there is no spreading for the plague does not spread within it.
והפנימית להסגיר – for the plague remained unchanged.
בין כך ובין כך – whether it ceased/went away from the inside or whether it ceased/disappeared from the outside.
טהור – that just as if it the outer part [of the bright white spot on the skin] had spread to the quick flesh that is within it, this is not spreading, so when the inner [bright white spot on the skin] spreads to the quick flesh that is within the outer bright white spot on the skin, it is not spreading. And the Halakha is according to Rabbi Akiba.

Mishnah 6

אימתי – the outer [bright white spot on the skin] is pure when the inner [bright white spot on the skin] or the outer [bright white spot on the skin] has spread on the quick flesh, for we stated above that the outer [bright white spot on the skin] is pure (see the previous Mishnah), these words apply when it is exactly the size of a lentil, that the quick flesh is like an exactly defined lentil, not less and not more. But if the quick flesh is greater [in size] than that of a lentil, [the excess is a token/sign of spreading for the inner one (i.e., the bright white spot on the skin) and the outer one (i.e., the bright white spot on the skin) is unclean].
המותר סימן פסיון לפנימית והחיצונה טמאה – that is to say, if the inner [bright white spot on the skin] spread over that excess, both of them are to be declared to be definitive leprosy. The inner one because of the spreading and the outer one because of the quick flesh. But if the outer one (i.e., the bright white spot on the skin) spread over that excess, nevertheless, the outer one is to be declared definitive leprosy because of the quick flesh and the inner one is to [cause] to be shut up/isolated. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Shimon.
היה בוהק פחות מכעדשה (if the white scurf/tetter was less than a lentil) – near the inner [bright white spot on the skin], and the outer [bright white spot on the skin] surrounds the white scurf/tetter.
סימן פשיון לפנימית – if the inner [bright white spot on the skin] spread and covered the white scurf/tetter, the inner [bright white spot on the skin] is to be declared a definitive leprosy , for it has spread from the outside. But if the outer [bright white spot on the skin] spread and covered the white scurf/tetter, it is not a sign/token of spreading for the outer [bright white spot on the skin] for the plague does not spread within. And that it (i.e., the Mishnah) used the phrase: "היה בוהק פחות מכעדשה"/it was a white scurf/tetter less than a lentil -, for if it was like a lentil, it would defile because of the quick flesh for we hold that quick flesh defiles in all of the appearances [of plagues], but less than a lentil, there is no quick flesh, for there is no quick flesh that is less than a lentil.

Mishnah 7

שאינן מיטמאין משום מחיה – as it is written (Leviticus 13:5): “[On the seventh day] the priest shall examine him”/וראהו הכהן [ביום השביעי], we require that he should examine the plague with all of the quick flesh as one, and when there is like a [Cilician] split bean at the tip of the nose or at the tip of the joints [of the hands and feet] it inclines/slants this way and that way and he is not able to examine it all as one.
ראשי אזנים – [the tips of the ears] are considered as one. And similarly, the tips of the breasts. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Yehuda who counted the tips of the breast that are on a man.
וראש הגויה – which is the membrum virile.
יבלות (warts on the skin) – it is the language of (Leviticus 22:22): ["או חרוץ או יבלת"]/ “or maimed or with a wen” PURUSH in the foreign language.
ודלדולין (a wart with a thin neck) – flesh that separated and was torn loose/detached. But there are those who have the reading of "ותלתולין"/warts, flesh that became like a high mound. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Eliezer.

Mishnah 8

שאינן מיטמאין בבהרת – in the four appearances of plagues, שאת/swelling and its subcategories/derivatives, בהרת/the bright white spot on the skin and its subcategories/derivatives.
תוך העין תוך האוזן – that all of these are not considered like the skin of the body, as Scripture states (Leviticus 13:2): "והיה בעור-בשרו"/ “on the skin of his body.”
הקמטין (the wrinkles) – that are in the rest of the body.
והקמטין שבצואר (the wrinkles/folds that are on the neck) – the Mishnah teaches the concluding clause to reveal that the wrinkles/folds of the first clause are the folds/wrinkles of the rest of the body , that doesn’t state the wrinkles of the neck especially, that don’t appear as other.
תחת הדד – when it appears like she is nursing her child, what it doesn’t appear at that time does not defile.
ובית השחי (the arm-pit) – when it appears like he is harvesting olives.
כף הרגל (the sole of the foot) – what is underneath [the bottom] of the foot. And all of these are not the skin of the body that appears.
והצפורן – it is not considered the skin of the body.
הראש והזקן – are not defiled through the bright white spot on the skin/בהרת, as it is written (Leviticus 13:30): “it is a scall, a scaly eruption in the hair or beard,” the head nor the beard have defilement other than the defilement of the bald (blanched) spots on the head or in the beard/נתקין.
השחין והמכוה והקדח המורדים (the boils and the burning and the blisters/inflammation that are festering – not covered by a scab – running wounds from contusions, burns or inflammation -Jastrow) – that had not healed properly, and a cover/crust did not form over their skin like the husk of garlic.
אין מיטמאין משום נגע – that regarding boils it is written (Leviticus 13:18): “When an inflammation ]appears on the skin of one’s body[ and it heals”/["ובשר כי-יהיה בו-בערו] שחין ונרפא", and with regard to burning it is also written (Leviticus 13:24): “[When the skin of one’s body sustains a burn by fire,] and the patch from the burn is a discoloration.”/"[או בשר כי-יהיה בערו מכות-אש] והיתה מחית המכוה".
קדח (blister, inflammation) – it is a boil that comes on account of something else, as for example, on account of being struck b a stone or wood or peat or plaster/lime, and the burning also does not come on account of the fire itself, but on account of the derivatives/subcategories of fire, such as hot ashes/embers and hot plastering material, all of these are called blisters. It is the language of (Isaiah 64:1): “As when fire kindles brushwood/כקדח אש המסים”, and the running wounds not covered by a scab also, that did not heal, and did not raise up a scab like the husk of garlic, does not defile because of the plague.
המורדים – all the time that it didn’t heal that it didn’t raise up a scab is called, "מורדים"/wounds that are festering, meaning to say, that they still stand in their rebellion. But there are those who have the reading "מוררים"/bitter, afflicting with two [letters] "ר". It is the language of (Leviticus 15:3): “[The impurity from his discharge shall mean the following -] whether his member runs with the discharge”/"רר בשרו".
ואין מצטרפין בנגעים – there was a half split bean plague in the skin of his flesh or a half split bean plague in one of these places, they do not combine to make a [Cilician] bean.
ואין הנגע פושה לתוכן (and the plague does not spread into them) – for since hey don’t become defiled at the starting point of leprosy, they don’t also become defiled through spreading.
ואינן מיטמאין משום מחיה – that if blossomed/spread throughout, and there is at his head or on the sole of his foot or in the folds of his living flesh, they don’t become defiled because of quick flesh. Alternatively, if one of these places was surrounded within the plague, it doesn’t become defiled through quick flesh.
ואינם מעכבים את ההופך כולו לבן (and they don’t hinder [the cleanness of] the one who turns entirely white)- if the leprosy sprouted throughout all [of the body] except for one of these places, they don’t hinder [the cleanness] a, as it is written (Leviticus 13:12): “[If the eruption spreads out over the skin] so that it covers all the skin of the affected person [from head to foot]/"וכסתה הצרעת את כל-עור הנגע [מראשו ועד-רגליו]", excluding to those that do not defile because of the plague.
חזר הראש והזקן ונקרחו (the head and the beard changed and became bald) – that the hair that on them became bald and became like the skin of the body. And similarly, the boil and the quick flesh and the blister/inflammation that became a scar, that healed and a scab of flesh formed on them like the husk of garlic.
הרי אלו מיטמאין בנגעים – with the four appearances (see Tractate Negaim, Chapter 1, Mishnah 1 and following). And the same law applies that he is able to teach that the wrinkles spread, also become defiled through plagues.
ואין מצטרפין בנגעים – head and beard do not combine. And similarly, the skin of the body and the beard, or the skin of the body and the head, do not combine. For if one-half of a split bean bald/blanched spots of the beard and half of a split bean in the skin of the body, do not combine. And similarly one-half of a split bean of boils and one-half of a split bean of the burns on the skin do not combine to become a full bean.
ואין הנגע פושה לתוכן – a plague of the skin of the flesh does not spread neither in the bald/blanched spots of the head and not in the bald, blanched spots of the beard, nor in the boils nor in the burnt spots, for they are not considered like the skin of the body.
ואין מיטמאין משום מחיה – that bald, blanched spots become defiled in yellow hair and spreading, and boils and burning in the white hair and spreading.
אבל מעכבין את ההופך כולו לבן (but they do hinder [the cleanness of] one who turns wholly white) – that if the leprosy sprouted in all of him but the head or the beard that were made bald remained that the leprosy did not sprout in them, or the boils and burning and the baldness that became scarred, is impure until it (i.e., the leprosy) blossoms throughout.
הראש והזקן שלא העלו שער – as for example a minor whose beard has not grown or the hair of his head, are judged like skin of the flesh to become defiled through a bright white spot in the skin. And similarly, the warts with a thin neck that are in the head or on the beard [of a person] that doesn’t have hair, are judged like the skin of the flesh, and they hinder the blossoming, and the plague spreads within them and combines to make a split [Cilician] bean.

Chapter 7



Mishnah 1

אלו בהרות טהורות שהיו בו קודם מתן תורה – whomever had on him leprosy prior to the Giving of the Torah, was not impure on account of that plague after the Giving of the Torah, as it is written (Leviticus 13:2): “When a person has on the skin of his body,” excluding what already was. And all these were also considered, from there they are derived, that we require that the plague would come to be at the time that it is appropriate to be defiled by it and not beforehand, like a convert until he had not converted and a minor until he had not been born. And similarly, all of them.
בקמט ונתגלה – that it was from the outset concealed within the wrinkle/fold and he was ritually pure, because it was in a covered part of the body/posterior, but afterwards, it was revealed.
ובמורדים – meaning to say with boils and burns, the scars that did not deal and did not produce a scab like the husk of the garlic.
עד שלא העלו שער – the plague comes, that it is considered like the skin of the flesh, that is the beginning of defilement. But when the hairs arose, it was pure, for its law is like bald or blanched spots on the head or the beard, but when they became bald, that is, their end is defilement. And similarly, boils, and burnt spots on the skin and baldness, that until they did not come, the plague came, that is defilement. But when the boils, burnt spots on the skin and the baldness came, that is purity. For we require that the boils and the burnt spots on the skin come prior to the swelling/sore, as it is written (Leviticus 13:19): “And a white swelling or a white discoloration streaked with red develops where the inflammation was,”/"והיה במקום השחין שאת" , that the boils precede the swelling/sore and not that the swelling/sore precedes the boils. And when they returned and became a scar, that is defilement.
והיו – that they healed properly/nicely.
רבי אליעזר בן יעקב מטמא – since at the outset the plague came in the skin of the flesh, and it returned at its end to its initial status, we are not concerned about the interruption that is between them.
וחכמים מטהרים – since the purity stopped in the meantime. And the Halakha is according to the Sages.

Mishnah 2

נשתנו מראיהן – it refers to the bright white spots on the skin that are pure, as for example, that it was like snow until he (i.e., a non-Jew) converted, but when he converted [to Judaism] it became like the lime in the Temple.
כצמר לבן וכקרום ביצה – meaning to say, that at first it was like white wool, and now it became like the membrane/skin of an egg.
נעשית מספחת שאת (it became the scurf/second shade of a swelling/sore) – meaning to say that the swelling/sore became scurf, that it returned to become like its derivative/subcategory. Or that the strong/bright [white] became like its scurf. But he is really explaining to the first clause (i.e., presenting a new interpretation of the Mishnah in order to refute an argument based upon that text), as it is taught [in the Mishnah]: "היתה כשלג ונעשית כסיד ההיכל"/it was as white as snow and it became as white as the lime in the Temple, that is that it became stronger/brighter than a rising on the skin. And it that was like white wool but became like the membrane/skin of an egg, that it is that the swelling/sore became a rising on the skin.
וכסיד ההיכל והשלג – meaning to say that it was like the lime of the Temple but now it became like snow.
רבי עקיבא אומר וכו' – And the Halakha is according to Rabbi Akiba.

Mishnah 3

בהרת – from here we are dealing with bright white spots on the skin which are impure/unclean.
ואין בה כלום – neither quick flesh nor white hair.
בתחלה – when he was brought to the Kohen. And then at the end of the first week, if nothing resulted/was forthcoming, he would be shut up/placed in isolation.
בסוף שבוע שני – if nothing resulted/was forthcoming, he is released. And similarly, after the release, if nothing resulted/was forthcoming, he remains in this release all his days and furthermore is not shut up/placed in isolation.
עודנו מסגירו – that he (i.e., the Kohen) wanted to shut him up/isolate him, whether at the outset when he was brought to the Kohen or whether at the end of the first week, but he did not manage of isolate him until tokens/signs of defilement were forthcoming/resulted, as for example, at the outset with the white hair and the quick flesh, , and at the end of the first week with white hair and quick flesh and spreading, he would be declared a certified leper. But, from when he was shut up/put in isolation, it is taught above in the third chapter (see Mishnah 1 of the third chapter of Tractate Negaim): "אין מחליטין את המוסגר"/They do not declare one who is shut up/isolated a certified leper.
ופוטר – meaning to say, or they release him. S for example, at the end of the second week. But even after the release, if tokens/signs of defilement were forthcoming/resulted, he is to be declared a certified leper.
עודהו מחליטו (he is still in the process of certifying him – as a leper) – that he had [come] to certify him as a leper, but he had not been able to do it until the signs/tokens of defilement had gone away.
בתחלה – when he was brought to the Kohen. או בסוף שבוע ראשון, יסגיר – by t if from when he declared him to be a certified leper, they went away, as for example, that he declared him to be a certified leper with the white hair, and it went away but the bright white spot on the skin exists, they don’t shut him up/isolate him for it, but release him and he is pure.

Mishnah 4

התולש סימני טומאה – as for example, the white hair in the skin of the flesh, or the yellow hair that are bald, blanched spots on the head or in the beard.
והכווה את המחיה (if one cauterized/scalded the cicatrizing spot – i.e., quick flesh) – that from when it was cauterized/burnt, it is not a sign/token of defilement.
עובר בלא תעשה – of (Deuteronomy 24:8): “In cases of skin affection be most careful [to do exactly as the Levitical priests instruct you. Take care to do as I have commanded them.]”/"השמר בנגע-הצרעת [לשמר מאד ולעשות ככל אשר-יורו אתכם הכהנים הלוים כאשר צויתם תשמרו לעשות]". And in every place where it states [in the Torah]: "השמר"/Be most careful, "פן"/lest; and "אל"/do not, it is not other than a negative commandment.
ולטהרה – meaning to say, that in regard to cleanness/purity, what is the law?
עד שלא בא אצל כהן – if he tears them out/plucks them, he is pure. But if he tears them out after he has been declared a certified leper, he is impure.
הולכים לגדווד – we have this reading. And it is the name of a place.
בתוך הסגירו מהו (if he does it during his quarantine – what is the law) – if he tore out/plucks the tokens/signs of defilement within the week of the first isolation/quarantine or of the second isolation, what is the law?
התחלתי מביא להם ראיות – in the Tosefta (Tractate Negaim, Chapter 3, Halakha 4) . Here we do not have the reading of the words of the Sages or until the bright white spot on the skin is reduced from being like a split [Cilician] bean, that especially concerning one who tears out/plucks out the tokens/signs of defilement during his being shut up/in isolation/quarantine is also the law that he would be pure/clean, for the Kohen that did not see the signs/tokens of defilement that are in him. Therefore, one who stands before a Kohen, meaning to say, one, that person who stands before a Kohen and hurries to pluck out/tear out the signs/tokens of defilement before the Kohen would say to him: “You are impure,” and one who tears them out within the days of his isolation, whether this or that, they are pure. And such is the Halakha.
מאימתי הוא טהרתו – of the person who tore out/plucked the signs/tokens of defilement after he was declared to be a certified leper.
כשיוולד לו נגע אחר ויטהר ממנו – for since he was cured from the second, the matter became revealed that the All-Merciful has forbearance upon him, or alternatively, that the first [plague] endures and he will be healed from that one as well.
עד שתפרח בכולו (until it spreads over his entire body) – the last plague, that one doesn’t have to be concerned for anything, because if he had in him also the first, now, however/at least, he would be pure.
או עד שתתמעט בהרתו מכגריס – for even if the hair had not been torn out nor the quick flesh cauterized, he would be made pure, for since that the bright white spot on the skin had been reduced from [the size] of a split [Cilician] bean . But however, until it spread through is entire body, is not referring other than to someone who tears out the signs/tokens of impurity, but cauterizing the quick flesh is not made pure through an eruption (i.e., the white eruption which causes the leper to be declared clean – see Leviticus 13:12), for if the quick flesh exists, it was not pure through an eruption. And the Halakha is according to the Sages.

Mishnah 5

ונקצצה טהורה – as it is written (Leviticus 13:46): “He shall be impure as long as the disease is on him,” but not the days that the bright white spot on his skin was on him and it was cut off.
קצצה מתכוין – in the Tosefta (Tractate Negaim, Chapter 3, Halakha 5 ) it is proven that where he cut off all of the bright white spot on the skin and cut off from the flesh that was around it with it, no one disagrees that he doesn’t have eternal purity. For the Rabbis fined him after he had intended to uproot it/tear it out. But where he cut it and left a remainder from it, whatever the amount, everyone does not argue that he has purity through an eruption (i.e., the white eruption which causes the leper to be declared clean), since he left a remnant from it, they did not fine him all that much. What they do disagree about is when he cut off the bright white spot in the skin in an exactly defined manner, like it is, no less and no more.
ר' אליעזר אומר לכשיולד לו נגע אחר ויטהר ממנו וחכמים אומרים עד שתפרח בכולו – And the Halakha is according to the Sages (i.e., until it spreads all over him). Here we do not have the reading of the words of the Sages (as we had in the previous Mishnah): "או עד שתתמעט בהרת מכגריס"/or until his bright white spot on the skin will diminish to less than the size of a split [Cilician] bean, that specifically concerning tearing/plucking out, the signs/tokens of defilement of the first clause [of the Mishnah]: "ונשארה הבהרת"/but the bright white spot in the skin remained. There it belongs to teach [in the Mishnah]: “until it diminishes to less than the size of a split [Cilician] bean,” but here, the entire bright white spot in the skin was cut off.
ואם היתה בראש הערלה ימול – we are not dealing with circumcision at its appropriate time (i.e., eight-days old for a baby boy), for this is a simple matter, now that on Shabbat the prohibition [which if one violates it leads to the punishment] of stoning is suspended; leprosy, which is a mere prohibition, not all the more so, but even circumcision that is not [performed] at its appropriate time, does not supersede the Sabbath, but supersedes the leprosy, for the positive commandment of circumcision comes and supersedes the negative commandment of leprosy, and in this we hold throughout the entire Torah. Every place that you find a positive commandment and a negative commandment, if you are able to fulfill both of them, it is good. But if not, the positive commandment should come and supersede the negative commandment.

Chapter 8



Mishnah 1

הפורח מן הטמא טהור (a leprosy that blossoms after a person has been declared unclean, is clean) -an unclean person that was declared a certified leper with one of the plagues, and afterwards it blossomed throughout his body (i.e., that it all turned white), is pure.
חזרו בו ראשי אברים (the tips of the limbs reappeared with it) – if after the “blossoming”/eruption (i.e., the white eruption which causes the leper to be declared clean) even the tips of the limbs reappeared alone.
טמא – as it is written (Leviticus 13:14): “But as soon as un-discolored flesh appears in it, he shall be impure.”/"וביום הראות בו בשר חי יטמא" , and it should appear like a lentil.
עד שתתמעט בהרתו מכגריס – that he gave rise/brought forth the entire plague and nothing remains of it like the size of a split bean.
מטהור טמא – something pure that the leprosy blossomed throughout his body. As for example that he had declared him to be a certified leper with white hair or quick flesh and the white hair fell out or the quick flesh was covered, and he was released; alternatively, he (i.e., the Kohen) locked him up/isolated him with a bright white spot on the skin the size of a split [Cilician] bean but it remained unchanged for two weeks and he was released, in all of these, if after his release it blossomed throughout his body, he is impure.
עד שתחזור לכמות שהיתה – that if there remained from the blossoming whatever the amount near/adjacent to the starting point of leprosy, he is unclean because of spreading, for as it is taught in the Mishnah adjacent (see Mishnah 2 of this eighth chapter of Tractate Negaim) that if the quick flesh went away and afterwards it (i.e., the bright white spot) blossomed over all of his body, he is pure, and it is also taught in the Mishnah (i.e., see Mishnah 3 of this eighth chapter of Tractate Negaim) concerning the bright white spot on the skin/בהרת and in it is white hair which blossomed throughout his body, even though the white hair is in its place, he is pure, and it implies, that all the more so, if it (i.e., the white hair) is not in its place, he is pure, for there (i.e., Mishnah 3 of this chapter) we are speaking that the Kohen did not yet release him when it blossomed throughout his body, but here (in our Mishnah) we are speaking when he (i.e., the Kohen) released him and afterwards it blossomed throughout his body.

Mishnah 2

ואח"כ הלכה לה מחיה – that the plague spread upon it. But at the hour of the blossoming, the quick flesh did not go away until afterwards [but the quick flesh was not covered] the blossoming does not purify it.

Mishnah 3

בהרת – like the size of a split [Cilician] bean.
ובה שער לבן – surely it comes to tell us that blossoming [of the bright white spot] purifies after all of the tokens/signs of defilement.
פרחה במקצתו טמא – it is necessary to inform us that even if it blossomed through most of his body, that we don’t say, the majority is like the whole. Alternatively it informs us that at the end of the first week or at the end of the second week he is impure with blossoming over part of his body even whatever the amount because of spreading.

Mishnah 4

שבפריחתן טיהרו טמא – that through their blossoming, they have purified the defiled person. When they have reappeared and have been uncovered/revealed after that, he returns to his defilement.
שבחזירתם טמאו טהור – that through their return that they returned and were uncovered/revealed. They defiled the pure person, if they returned and were covered that the plague spread upon them, he is pure, bur if they returned and were uncovered afterwards, he is impure. And it is necessary to inform us that even many times, as it is taught [in this Mishnah], even one hundred times.

Mishnah 5

כל הראוי לטמא בנגע הבהרת (all who are susceptible to be defiled through the plague of the bright white spot) – such as the skin of the flesh.
מעכב את הפריחה (hinders the blossoming [over the entire body which marks the person as clean])- if there remained from it whatever the amount that did not blossom in it, it hinders/delays his purification.
וכל שאינו ראוי ליטמא בנגע הבהרת – as for example, the head and the beard, and all of these that are considered together with them.
אין מעכבין את הפריחה – for even though the plague did not blossom upon them, since it blossomed in the rest of the body, he is ritually pure. And the tips of the limbs are not considered for they hinder the blossoming, for they are susceptible to become defiled through the plague of the bright white spot in the skin, for the plague spreads in them.
ונעשו צרבת טהורים (and they formed a scab, they are pure) – even though that now when the head and/or the beard became bald they became susceptible to be defiled through the plague of the bright white spot on the skin, and similarly, boils and burns and the festering blister formed a scab, they are like the skin of the flesh, since at the time of the blossoming, they were not susceptible, they are not hindered and are pure.
אע"פ שנעשה מקום המחיה בהרת טמא – for the first blossoming is not blossoming, since there remains from the skin of the flesh one-half of a lentil adjacent to the head, whereas the current blossoming where the quick flesh is covered of half a lentil’s size is also not considered blossoming, since they have been made bald already and they made a scab, they are like the skin of the flesh, and it is not effective until it blossoms also upon them.

Mishnah 6

אחת טמאה – certified as a leper.
ואחת טהורה – after the release, that it remained unchanged at he end of the second week.
ופרחה מזו לזו – whether from pure to impure or whether from impure to pure.
ואח"כ פרחה בכולו טהור – because something ritually pure becomes impure when it blossomed from it to defile it, for it had spread, and when it blossomed afterwards through the entire body, it is blossoming from (the impure to the pure) [the impure, and the pure].
בשפתו העליונה ([if there were two bright spots, each the size of half of split [Cilician] bean]] one on his upper lip) – half of a split [Cilician] bean of a bright white spot on the skin, and on his upper lip, half of a split [Cilician] bean, and when he closes his mouth, it appears like a split [Cilician] bean in one place. And similarly on two fingers or on the two eye-lids with eye-lashes, and he makes them cleave together it appears like a complete [Cilician] bean.
אבל לא בבוהק (but not on the white scurf/tetter) – it appears white below from the four appearances and hinders the blossoming.
חזרו בו ראשי אברים – that were revealed from the plague and became a white scurf/tetter.
טהור – and the same law applies in the rest of the body, for even though the white scurf/tetter hinders the blossoming at the outset, it doesn’t hinder it at the end, and subsidiary to the concluding clause [of the Mishnah] that wishes to teach "ראשי אברים"/the tips of the limbs, it teaches [in the Mishnah] here, “the tips of the limbs.” But in the concluding clause, it (i.e., the Mishnah) takes the phrase, “the tips of the limbs” to inform you about the power of [the opinion of] Rabbi Meir that even at the tips of the limbs that were revealed/uncovered less than the size of a lentil, and became a white scurf/tetter, Rabbi Meir declares unclean, and all the more so in the rest of the body, but that of the first-clause [of the Mishnah] that “the tips of the limbs reappeared,” like a species of pure/clean white scurf, it is brought according to the Rabbis, but not according to Rabbi Meir. But the Rabbis who declare it pure, not exactly/specifically less than a lentil, for even more also it is ritually pure, for a white scurf/tetter at the end does not hinder. And the Halakha is according to the Sages.

Mishnah 7

הבא כולו לבן – from the outset he comes completely covered with a plague.
יסגיר – like the law of a bright white spot on the skin like a split [Cilician] bean, lest it subsequently appear on him white hair or quick flesh. For the white eruption which causes the leper to be declared clean does not purify at the outset.
נולד לו שער לבן – at the end of the first week or at the end of the second week, let him be declared a certified leper. But if these tokens/signs of impurity did not appear, he should be released.
השחירו שתיהן – all of these that are considered, they are signs/tokens of purity, and they are explained above at the end of the first chapter (Mishnah 6).
נולד לו מחיה או שער לבן – if after these signs/tokens of ritual purity came, there appeared upon him quick flesh or white hair, he is impure, but if not, he is ritually pure.
וכולן שחזרו בהם ראשי אברים – He that comes entirely white at the outset, whether he needed to be shut up/placed in isolation/quarantine whether to be declared as a certified leper or whether to be released, if their tips of the limbs reappeared/were uncovered again, they are like they were and ritually pure, as we don’t consider the quick flesh. How so? A person who comes entirely white from the outset and was isolated/quarantined for two weeks and there didn’t appear on him signs/tokens of impurity, and he was released, but afterwards, the tips of the limbs were uncovered/revealed on him, that is, that the tips of the limbs returned from the release, and he is pure. But if he was declared to be a certified leper with white hair and the hair turned black, and afterwards, the tips of the limbs were uncovered/revealed, that is, the tips of the limbs were restored while being a certified leper and he is pure. But if at the end of the first week or the end of the second week, the tips of the limbs were revealed/uncovered, that is, the tips of the limbs were restored on him while in isolation/quarantine, and he is ritually pure. This is how the explanation of this Mishnah appeared from Sifra/Torat Kohanim. But Maimonides did not explain it this way.
פרחה במקצתו – in part of the tips of the limbs that were uncovered/revealed.
טמא – that behold the plague spread.
פרחה בכולו – after it had blossomed in part of it.
טהור – that he has blossoming from the impure, but if from the outset after the tips of the limbs were uncovered it blossomed throughout the entire body at one time, he is impure because of spreading. But that which the first clause [of the Mishnah] teaches that if it blossomed in part of his body, he is impure, the same law applies when it blossomed/erupted throughout the body, he is also impure, but it (i.e., the Mishnah) did not use [the phrase] "פרחה במקצתו"/that it blossomed in part of the body other than because it wanted to teach the latter "פרחה בכולו טהור"/it blossomed/erupted in all of his body that he is pure, that is, after it blossomed/erupted in part of his body.

Mishnah 8

מתוך הטהרה טמא – as for example, a person who comes completely white at the outset, and after the isolation/quarantine/being shut up or the declaration of being a certified leper he became pure, if the tips of the limbs returned on him and were uncovered, he is pure, as we explained above (i.e., in the previous Mishnah). But if during a state of cleanness/purity, they returned and became uncovered at one instant, he is impure because of spreading, and that is what it states, that if it blossomed/erupted (the white eruption which causes the leper to be declared clean) at once while in a state of purity, he becomes impure, as we explained in the Mishnah above, that if it his entire body blossomed/erupted at a single instant, he is also impure like [the case of] part of his body blossoming/erupting.
פטור מן הפריעה ומן הפרימה (he is exempt from the letting the hair grow in neglect and rending his garments – see Leviticus 13:45) – all the while that he is in quarantine/isolation. But whereas he is pure/clean while he is in a state of being a certified leper, he is obligated for letting his hair grow in neglect and tearing his clothing, all the while that he is a certified leper. פריעה ופרימה: His clothing will be torn and his hair in disarray.
מטמאין בביאה – if they came into the tent, everything that is in the tent is defiled.

Mishnah 9

פרחה בכולו ואח"כ נתגלו בו ראשי אברים – here we are speaking about [the case] that he (i.e., the Kohen) did not manage to declare him a certified leper until it had erupted/blossomed throughout all of his body and uncovered the tips of the limbs, that Rabbi Yishmael compared him to someone who comes in totally white at the outset except for the tips of the limbs, which requires isolation/quarantine/being shut up. But Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah holds that since whereas it did not erupt/blossom, he (i.e., the Kohen) would declare him to be a certified leper, his law is like a small bright white spot on the skin which has on it quick flesh, for if it had erupted on his entire body and afterwards, the tips of the limbs were uncovered/revealed, he would be impure. And there is more to explain, that even if he had declared him a certified leper with quick flesh and it had erupted throughout all of the body and he had purified him, as Rabbi Yishmael holds, that one does not defile with the reappearance of the tops of the limbs, that one defiles with the reappearance of the tops of the limbs that is after the eruption/blossoming [which causes the leper to be declared clean], where he is pure in the practice of eruption/blossoming, but here, it is not the practice of eruption/blossoming where he is pure, for had there been a diminution of quick flesh from like the size of a lentil, he would be pure.

Mishnah 10

מי שהיה מוחלט – with white hair or quick flesh or spreading.
לא הספיק להראות לכהן – that the signs/tokens of uncleanness/impurity went away.
שאילו הראה לכהן – that the signs/tokens of impurity had gone away, he (i.e., the Kohen) would have purified hi, but if after that it flowered/erupted, he was impure, that he would be flowering from a state of being clean/pure. But now, it is for him a flowering from a state of being impure, and he is pure.
בהרת ואין בה כלום – that there is no sign/token from the signs/tokens of impurity.
עד שפרחה בכולו טמא – meaning to say, he is required to be in isolation/shut-up/quarantine like one who comes [to the Kohen] totally white at the outset. But if from the outset, prior to it erupting/flowering, he showed it to the Kohen, he would be shut up/put in isolation/quarantine, and at the end of the week when it flowered/erupted, he would be like someone who had a white eruption which causes the leper to be declared clean from within isolation and would be pure.

Chapter 9



Mishnah 1

השחין והמכוה מיטמאין בשבוע אחד – if in their place (i.e., the boil or the burning) was born/originated the bright white spot on the skin, we shut him up/quarantine/isolate him and at the end of one week if there is white hair or spreading, he (i.e., the Kohen) declares him to be a certified leper, and if not, he releases him. But with quick flesh he is not defiled, for quick flesh requires live flesh, and this is not live flesh since in its place is boils and burning.
גפת (a pressed hard mass, peat, turf)- refuse of olives, and it is hot on account of itself. And similarly, the hot springs of Tiberias through the heat of their source they are hot and not in consequence of the fire.
כל שאינו מחמת האש זהו שחין – to include the lead directly from the mine (hot – see Tractate Hullin 8a).
רמץ (hot ashes, embers) – the ashes of a portable stove on feet (with caves for two pots). And it is hot on account of the fire.
כל שהוא מחמת האש – and it is hot from the effect of/in consequence of the fire. כל שהוא מחמת האש – to include the heat of the fire.

Mishnah 2

אין מצטרפין – one-half a split [Cilician] bean of boils with one-half a split [Cilician] bean of burning do not combine [to make] a complete split [Cilician] bean.
ואין פושין מזה וזה – that if a boil and a burning are one next to the other, and in one of them is a bright white spot on the skin the size of a split [Cilician] bean, and he was shut up/isolated/quarantined, and at the end of the week, it spread to its neighbor or on the skin of the flesh, we don’t declare him a certified leper. And similarly, if the bright white spot was on the skin of the flesh and spread to the boil or to the burn, it is not considered spreading.
היו מורדין – that they didn’t heal properly and the skin did not have a scab on it, and it still produces secretion, we don’t defile it through plagues, as it is written (Leviticus 13:18): “When an inflammation (i.e., boil) appears on the skin of one’s body and it heals.,” but with a burning, it is written (Leviticus 13:24): "והיתה מחית המכוה"/ “and the patch from the burn is a dis-coloration, [either white streaked with rea, or white.]”
אע"פ שנעשה מקומו צלקת (even though spot became the rough, scabby surface/scar) – that it is recognized that there was a boil there or a burn and it is not equivalent to the rest of the skin of the flesh, nevertheless it is judged like the skin of the flesh, for after it became a strong scab.

Mishnah 3

אמרו לו למה – [why] should he be shut up/put in quarantine/isolated, but it is impossible for him to give rise to a sign/token of impurity?
לגדל שער אין ראויה – for the palm of the hand one never grows hair ever.
לפשיון אינה פושה – for boils and burning do not spread on the skin of the flesh (as we saw in the previous Mishnah).
ולמחיה אינה מטמא – for it is taught in the Mishnah (see Mishnah 1 of this chapter) that with two signs/tokens – with white hair and spreading but not with quick flesh.
שמא תכנוס (perhaps it will contract) – like a split [Cilician] bean, and when the Kohen will see it at the end of the week he will release him, but after the release, it will return and spread within the boil whose place is like a Sela and he will declare him to be a certified leper.
אמרו לו הרי מקומה כגריס – meaning to say, that if it the place of the scar/shriveled surface was like a split [Cilician] bean alone and the bright white spot on the skin was in it, why would he (i.e., the Kohen) isolate/quarantine him, but does it not belong to state here that perhaps it will contract and then spread?
אמר להן לא שמעתי – meaning to say that he (i.e., the Kohen) should also shut him up/isolate him/quarantine him, but I did not hear the reason regarding it.
אלמד בו – permit me that I will teach a thing regarding this law.
אם לקיים דברי חכמים הן – if you find a reason to uphold the words of the Sages that stated that it requires isolation/quarantine, say it, but to teach that it doesn’t require isolation/quarantine, do not say it, for I do not set aside what I received from my Rabbis and listen from you.
שמא יוולד לו שחין אחר חוצה לו ויפשה לתוכו – that boils spread into boils. And this is the Halakha.

Chapter 10



Mishnah 1

הנתקים (bald, blanched spot) – plagues that are in the head or in the beard are called נתקים, as a result that the hair is torn loose and falls and drops off on account of the plague. But the bald, blanched spots do not become defiled in the four appearances like a plague in the place of flesh, bur become defiled through all of the appearances.
בשער צהוב – similar to the golden shape.
דק לקוי קצר (thin - so diseased -sparse that it is short hair) – what the Torah stated (Leviticus 13:30): “[The priest shall examine the affection. If it appears to go deeper than the skin] and here is thin yellow hair in it, [the priest shall pronounce him impure; it is a scall, a scaly eruption in the hair or beard],” the implication of לקוי/diseased – sparse – is that it is short.
אפילו ארוך – that its implication is not thin, but rather beaten/flattened.
מה הלשון אומרים – you learn from the language usage of people. When they say, “this reed is thin,” what is its implication? Whether it is diseased that it is short or whether it is diseased that it is long. But there are books that have the reading: "ולא לקוי ארוך"/but it is not diseased that it is long, in astonishment, meaning to say, that perhaps it is so diseased that it is short, but not so diseased that it is long.
נלמוד מן השער – it is the manner of people when they speak about the hair that it is thin, they say that when it is diseased, it is short, but not on the diseased [hair] that it is long. And the Halakha is according to Rabbi Akiba.

Mishnah 2

מכונס (close together) – two hairs in one place.
מפוזר – one in the eastern part of the plague and one its western part [of the plague].
מבוצר (surrounded -of the hair in the flesh affected by the eruption) – that the hair in the middle of the bald, blanched spot on the head, like a fortress that is in the middle of the city.
הפוך – that the hair was turned to yellow because of the bald, blanched spot in the head, as for example, that the bald, blanched spot in the head preceded the hair.
ושאינו הפוך – that the yellow/golden hair preceded the bald, blanched spot in the head.
שאין שער אחד מציל מידו – that if there is in the plague two white hairs, even filled with black hairs, they don’t protect (on the two) white hairs that they should not be defiled. But the yellow/golden hair, if there is with it [two] black hairs, it does not defile. And the Halakha is according to Rabbi Yehuda.

Mishnah 3

הצומח – black hair that grew in the bald, blanched spot on the head.
מציל מיד שער צהוב ומיד פשיון – that if he had been declared a certified leper through golden hair or with spreading, and two black hairs grew, he is pure.
בין מכונס – that both of them are in one place.
בין מפוזר – one to the east of the plague and one to the west [of the plague].
והמשואר – that the two black hairs preceded those for the bald, blanched spot on the head, as for example, if the hair of his head or his beard had been torn loose like a split [Cilician] bean, there remained within the bald, blanched spot two black hairs.
מבוצר (of the hair in the flesh affected by the eruption – are cut off) – if they are cut off in the middle of the bald, blanched spot on the head, they protect. But if they stand from the side, they do not protect.
עד שיהא רחוק מן הקמה – until there would be these two hairs [of the same color] far from the hairs that surround the bald, blanched spot on the head (or beard) like the measure of two hairs. But the hairs that are around the bald, blanched spot [on the head] are called קמה/standing, and when these hairs are two hairs distant from the standing hairs, they are considered like they are an eruption surrounded with sound flesh within the plague.
אחת צהובה ואחת שחורה – with the golden [hair] that preceded the bald, blanched spot, there wasn’t a token/sign of defilement, it is necessary for him (i.e., the Tanna/teacher of the Mishnah) to state that they don’t combine with the black hair to protect from the golden hair and from the spreading. But our anonymous Mishnah is according to Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov who stated nearby ahead (see the next Mishnah), that the golden hair that preceded the bald, blanched spot on the head does not defile and it does not protect.

Mishnah 4

רבי יהודה מטמא – as it is taught in the Mishnah above (i.e., Mishnah 2 of this chapter) that Rabbi Yehuda defiles already turned (i.e., its color) or not turned.
ר' אליעזר בן יעקב אומר לא מטמא ולא מציל – Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov and Rabbi Shimon explain the matter of the first Tanna/teacher (in the second Mishnah) that they brought it pure, Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov holds that it is pure, for the first Tanna/teacher to state that it doesn’t defile, but it doesn’t protect. But Rabbi Shimon holds that it is pure and protects as he states, but above, we made the legal decision that the Halakha is according to Rabbi Yehuda.

Mishnah 5

כיצד מגלחין את הנתק – at the end of the first week (to his isolation/being shut up/quarantined) that it did not spread and did not give rise to golden hair (as it is written – Leviticus 13:33 – “the person with the scall shall shave himself [but without shaving the scall; the priest shall isolate him for another seven days]).”
היה מגלח חוצה לו – he shaves around the bald, blanched spot [on the head or in the beard].
ומניח שתי שערות – as it is written (Leviticus 13:33): "והתגלח ואת-הנתק לא יגלח"/ “the person with he scall shall shave himself, but without shaving the scall,” for what does he have in it? For hasn’t the hair already been torn loose and fallen out? But rather, near the bald, blanched spot (i.e., the “scall”) he doesn’t shave, that he leaves around the bald, blanched spot two hairs from every side, it is found that the bald, blanched spot (i.e., the scall) is surround by hair like a crown.
החליטו בשער צהוב – and after he was declared a certified leper through it, the golden hair went away and after that came back.
וכן בפשיון – that the golden hair did not return but rather that it spread, whether this (i.e., golden hair) or that (i.e., spreading), he is a certified leper like he was.
בתחלה בסוף שבוע ראשון – meaning to say, this law that we stated is in effect whether he was declared a certified leper with the golden hair when he was brought to the Kohen, whether he was declared to be a certified leper with golden hair at the end of the first week, or at the end of he second week, or after the release, as for example, it remained unchanged for two weeks and he was released, but after the release, two yellow hairs appeared and he was declared a certified leper. But in all of them, [if] the golden hair went away and then returned, or that it didn’t return but the scall/bald, blanched spot, he is as he was.
החליטו בפשיון – as it was explained that he was declared a certified leper with the golden hair, such one explains his being declared a certified leper through spreading. But here, with spreading, we don’t have this reading at the beginning, for the spreading does not defile other than after isolation/being shut up.

Mishnah 6

שני נתקים זה בצד זה – and there is in each of them a like a Cilician split bean. For with bald, blanched spots (i.e., scalls), we require like the size of a split [Cilician] bean, as it is written (Leviticus 13:31): “But if the priest finds the scall affection”/נגע הנתק – and an analogy is made between נגע/plague and נתק/bald, blanched spot on the head (or on the beard), just as the plague is like the size of a split [Cilician] bean, so even the bald, blanched spot on the head (or on the beard) is like the size of a split [Cilician] bean. But if two bald, blanched spots/scalls are placed one next to the other and there is a line of hair that separating the two bald, blanched spots/scalls, and divides it into two like a partition that separates.
נפרץ – the hair of that line/row [that separates them].
במקום אחד – at the end of the first week of isolation/being shut up/quarantine or at the end of the second week or after the release.
טמא – for the bald, blanched spot/scall had spread.
בשני מקומות – that line/row that separated below and above and remained from that line/row two hairs in the middle.
טהור – for they (i.e., of the hair affected by the eruption) are surrounded and protected.
כמה תהא הפרצה – if in the two places they were separated, the measurement of the gap in the place of the two hairs, and thusly the hairs are considered be surrounded.
ואם במקום אחד נפרצו טמא – even if it was severed/broken off like the size of a split [Cilician] bean, it is impure, for the black hair is not surrounded and gathered in within the plague, since it is not severed in -two places.

Mishnah 7

זה לפנים מזה – as for example, if a bald, blanched spot/scall in the head [or in the beard] is like a split Cilician bean squared, and a row/line of hair completely surrounds it, except for that row/line that surrounds the bald, blanched spot/scall like [the size of] a split [Cilician] bean all around it, that, a strip of scall the width of a lentil surrounds the row of hair, and this is the measurement of the scall that surrounds the hair in the flesh affected by the eruption.
נפרץ ממקום אחד טמא – the inner part, for the black hair at its side and which is not surrounded inside it. But the outer part is pure, for there are black hairs that are surrounded inside it.
משתי מקומות טהור – the inside and all the more so, the outside, that both of them were made into one scall, and within them are two black hairs which are surrounded.
כמה תהא הפרצה – from the two places and it will be pure, the place of the two hairs.
נפרץ ממקום אחד כגריס טהור – for we have said (in the previous Mishnah), that if it was separated in one place, it is impure, that is, with less than a split [Cilician] bean. But after it was severed/broken off like a split [Cilician] bean, even in one place, the two scalls became one, and the hair that remains are surrounded.

Mishnah 8

ובו שער צהוב טמא – golden/yellow hair defiles, whether at the beginning [or] whether at the end of the first week, whether at the end of the second week,[or] whether after the release.
נולד בו שער שחור טהור – if it (i.e., the two black hairs) grew after the bald, blanched spot in the head [or the beard] even though they are not an eruption surrounded with sound flesh. But if it is a remainder, especially an eruption surrounded with sound flesh, that is distant by two hairs from the standing flesh of the head as we have stated.
אע"פ שהלך לו שער שחור טהור – for since the golden/yellow [hair] has been purified, it further does not defile, even though the black [hair] fell out, but, if he was declared a certified leper through spreading and the black [hair] came and purified the spreading and afterwards, the black [hair] went away, the spreading returns and defiles, or that it spread and contracted and then once again spread, we don’t say since the bald, blanched spot [in the head] became pure it does not defile.
כל נתק שטהר שעה אחת – whether that he was declared a certified leper through spreading and it contracted, or that black hair came and purified him, whether he was declared a certified leper with golden/yellow hair and black hair came and purified him and afterwards the black [hair] went away, or what that had contracted returned and became a bald, blanched spot, again this bald, blanched spot is not defilement forever, even though that we hold that the tokens/signs of his uncleanness, such as golden/yellow hair and spreading, and we don’t have need with these that already is purified with black hair, but even if it spread after the black went away or that other yellow/golden hair grew in it, since the bald, blanched spot was purified already, it further has no uncleanness.
ר' שמעון אומר כל שער צהוב שטהר שעה אחת – as for example, this that refers to at the time when the black [hair] comes, it has no uncleanness forever. But if after the black [hair] came, yellow/golden hair appeared in the bald, blanched spot or it spread afterwards, it is impure, for we don’t say that every bald, blanched spot that is purified. And the Halakha is according to the first Tanna/teacher [of the Mishnah].

Mishnah 9

וניתק כל ראשו – that the bald, blanched spot spread throughout the head, whether that he was certified as a leper with golden hair, whether he was certified as a leper through spreading.
טהור – that in all of it, spreading all over purifies (see Tractate Negaim, Chapter 7, Mishnah 5 and Chapter 8, Mishnayot 1 and 2). And from where do we learn that spreading throughout purifies in the head, as it is written (Leviticus 13:40): "ואיש כי ימרט ראשו קרח הוא טהור הוא"/ “If a man loses the hair of his head and becomes bald, he is pure.” Regarding the beard, from where do we learn [that the same is the case]? The inference teaches us: "ואיש"/if a man – to include the beard. But if the bald, blanched spot comes throughout at the outset, he is not pure, that just as if it turns all white at the beginning, he is not pure with regard to the bright white spot on the skin.
אין מעכבין זה את זה – if there was a bald, blanched spot on his head like the size of a split [Cilician] bean and afterwards all of his head became torn loose, even though the beard was not torn loose, he is pure. And similarly, when there is white spreading all over in the beard, but it doesn’t spread all white in the head, he is pure, for they do not hinder one another.
ודין הוא – that they do hinder.
שיש דבר אחד מפסיק ביניהן – that the hair of the head and of the beard that they do not become defiled with the bright white spot on the skin that intervenes between the skin of the face to the rest of the body. But the skin of the face and the rest of the body do hinder each other, for all that is appropriate to be defiled through the plague of the bright white spot on the skin hinders the eruption of the bright white spot on the skin which causes the leper to be declared clean.
אין מצטרפין זה עם זה – in the place that the head and the beard join together. If a half of a split [Cilician] bean was to originate in this one (i.e., the head) and a half of a split [Cilician] bean was to originate in that one, they do not combine.
ואין פושין מזה לזה – if there is a bald, blanched spot the size of a split [Cilician] bean on the head near/adjacent to the beard, and at the end of the first week or at the end of the second week or after the release, it spread on the beard, it is not considered spreading.
מן הפרק של לחי – [from the joint of the] upper [jawbone]. He pulls/stretches a thread from ear to ear, all that is from the thread and above is the head, and all that is from the thread and below is the beard.
פיקה של גרגרת (thyroid cartilage/Adam’s apple) – the top of the thyroid cartilage begins to protrude and go downward, and the flesh that surrounds the thyroid cartridge from outside is called פיקה /protruding cartilage.

Mishnah 10

הקרחת והגבחת ( a leprous affection on the back of the head – making it bald -from the crown sliding backwards; leprous affection on the front of the head making it bald- from the crown sliding down forward to where the hair begins) – both of them are in the head, but from where the slanting of the skull and backward is called קדקוד/the skull, opposite his face is called גבחת/the front of the head, as it is taught in the Mishnah nearby (i.e., in this Mishnah. And they are not like bald, blanched spots in the head, for the bald, blanched spots return and grow hair, but the leprous affection on the back of the head and the leprous affection on the front of the head do not return/come back and grow hair.
מיטמאות בשני שבועות – as it is written (Leviticus 13:43): "כמראה צרעת עור בשר"/ “like the leprosy of body skin in appearance, just as the body skin is in two weeks, so too here (i.e., with baldness of the back or front of the head) in two weeks.
ובמחיה ובסיון – as it is written (Leviticus 13:42): “[But if a white affection streaked with red appears on the bald part in the front or at the back of the head,] it is a scaly eruption that is spreading over the bald part in the front [or at the back of the head].”/"צרעת פורחת היא בקרחתו" . [The word] צרעת/affection – teaches that it defiles through quick flesh; [the word]פורחת /spreading, teaches that it defiles through spreading; [the word] "היא"/that it, teaches that it does not defile with white hair.
נשם (a medicine which produces depilation) – it is a drug that the person who consumes it does not grow hair, and the person who smeared it does not grow hair.
מכה שאינה ראויה לגדל שער – as for example a large would where the flesh becomes a rough, scabby surface/a scar.
פיקה של צואר (protruding cartilage of the neck) – this is the first vertebrae of the neck.
ואין פושות מזו לזו – from the leprous affection on the back of the head to the leprous affection on the front of the head or from the leprous affection on the front of the head to the leprous affection on the back of the head.
אם יש שער – that interrupts between them between the leprous affection on the back of the head and the leprous affection on the front of the head. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Yehuda.

Chapter 11



Mishnah 1

כל הבגדים – to include the clothing of slaves and women and minors, and even of a resident alien/גר תושב. But as long as they (i.e., the clothing) are from wool or flax, as it is written (Leviticus 13:47): “[When an eruptive affection occurs] in a cloth of wool or linen fabric/"בבגד צמר או בבגד פשתים", clothes of wool but there is no flax in them, but not clothing of something else.
יראו בתחילה – even with a plague that was in them prior to their coming into the hand of an Israelite. For this cloth is fit for plagues, but that the domain of a heathen hinders it, therefore the days that there was a plague in them while it was still in the domain of a heathen do not count from the number, but when it came into the domain of a Israelite, it should be examined at the outset.
עורות הים אינן מיטמאין – as it is written (Leviticus 13:48): "לפשתים ולצמר או בעור"/ “[in the warp or in the woof] of the linen or the wool, or in a skin [or in anything made of skin],” just as wool and flax are a species that grows on the land, even skin from a species that grows on the land.

And it is written (Leviticus 13:48): “[In the warp or in the woof] of the linen or the wool, [or in a skin or anything made of skin],” just as flax/linen is white, even wool is white, and the colored skins made by man do not become susceptible to uncleanness through plagues, but at the hands of Heave, they do become susceptible to uncleanness through plagues, according to the words of Rabbi Shimon.

Mishnah 4

ששתיו צבוע – its warp is colored, but that which is colored is not susceptible to uncleanness.
וערבו לבן – but if we follow after the woof which is white, it is susceptible to uncleanness.

אדמדם – the red that is among the reddish, meaning to say, that the appearance of the greens and the redness/reddish color in them is very strong. ירקרק/palest of pale green is like the wing of a peacock and like the long and thin foliage of a palm branch (that is prickly). אדמדם/red that is among the reddish is like the nice crimson of the blood.
היה ירקרק כגיסת ולסוף שבוע פשה אדמדם אצל ירקרק: 
נשתנה ופשה – as for example, that it was at the outset palest of pale green like a split [Cilician] bean, and at the end of the week, it spread and became large like a rock, but whether it was the starting point of leprosy or whether its spread was red that is among the reddish.
נשתנה ולא פשה – at the beginning it was like a split [Cilician] bean of pale green color and at the end like a split [Cilician] bean of reddish color.
כאילו לא נשתנה – and that which spread requires burning, and that which did not spread, we shut up/isolate/quarantine for a second week.
יראה (בתחלה) – that it is considered as if it hanged to another plague. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Yehuda.

[But] he saves the patch, that patch that he put on the place of the tear he saves, and he doesn’t burn it with the cloth.
חזר למטלית – o that place that he attached to it.
שורף את הבגד – as if it returned to the cloth itself. But the patch does not require burning, but rather if it is three [handbreadths] by three [handbreadths], he isolates/quarantines it, and if it remained unchanged two weeks or it spread in the first week, he burns it. But if it is less than three [fingerbreadths] by three [fingerbreadths] it is not susceptible to uncleanness by plagues.
הטולה מן המוסגר – that he made a patch from the piece of cloth that had been in isolation on the pure/clean cloth. And the isolated one is called to a cloth that remained unchanged in the first week but in the second became pale/dim, that he tears out from it the plague and burns what he tore, but the rest of the cloth is called מוסגר/isolated/quarantined.
חזר הנגע לבגד – that is isolated/quarantined. That this piece that was taken from it which is now a patch for a pure cloth, even though the cloth that is isolated/quarantined requires burning, as it is written (Leviticus 13:57): "ואם תראה עוד בבגד"/”And if it occurs again in the cloth.”
מציל את המטלית – that is this patch that was taken from it and attached on to a pure/clean cloth, we save/protect it and we don’t burn it with the quarantined/isolated cloth.
חזר – the plague.
למטלית – to this piece that was taken from the isolated/quarantined [cloth].
ישרף – the quarantined [cloth] in every place that it is , as if it was the piece that was attached to it. And that piece may serve he second cloth that is attached to it. בסימנים – that it is shut up/isolated/quarantined with the second cloth. For the law of the second is as if the plague is in it, whether in regard to isolation, or whether in regard to burning and washing and every matter. But after it served the second cloth, even if the plague went away completely from the piece, it (requires burning, for when the plague returned from its outset, it was already required burning.

Mishnah 7

קייטא – clothing that it is customary to wear in the days of the heat. The Aramaic translation of קיץ/summer is summer/קייטא. But it appears to me that it is the Roman language that calls the dress of a woman KUTYA.
שיש לו פספסין (that it has stripes)- striped/speckled in many colors, white and green and black and similar to those. [The word] פספסין – is the language of פס יד/the palm/the hand from the wrist to the tip of the finger, that the wrist is from the white cloth and the wrist is from the cloth of color.
ולבנים פושים מזה לזה – from [one] white [garment] to [another] white [garment]. But even though the colored part interrupts, it is considered spreading. For spreading far defiles with like the size of a split [Cilician] bean.
והרי הוא פספס יחידי (And lo, it is a distinctive check?) – meaning to say, if he didn’t have in it other than one speckled white area and all the rest are speckled colored. Does it require isolation or not because it lacks to where it would spread?
אמר להן לא שמעתי – meaning to say, I received from my Teachers/Rabbis that it requires isolation, but they did not explain the reason why.
אלמד בו – meaning to say, permit me to state before you a reason for the matter.
אם לפרש דברי חכמים הן – that you will not contradict what I have received [from my Rabbis].
שמא יעמוד שני שבועות – that even though he lacks in what manner it will spread, it is able to come to uncleanness, for if it remains unchanged for two weeks.
הפסיון הסמוך – that it spreads adjacent to/near the starting point of the leprosy.
הרחוק – that the starting point of the leprosy is at one end of the cloth and the spreading is at the other end.
והחוזר – as for example, that it became dim/pale in the second [week] that he tears it and burns what he tore, as it is written (Leviticus 13:57): "ואם תיראה עוד בבגד...ושרף [באש תשרפנו את אשר-בו הנגע]"/And if it occurs again in the cloth [whether in warp or in woof – or in any article of skin, it is a wild growth; the affected article] shall be consumed in fire.” (Bartenura does NOT accurately quote the verse as he has the word "ושרף"/and he shall burn – which does not appear in the text of the Torah.). And this is that which returns, and its measurement is like that of a split [Cilician] bean.

Mishnah 8

השתי והערב – [the warp and woof] of wool, that is recognized whether warp to woof,that the warp is thin and the woof is very thick.
השתי מישלק – as it is written (Leviticus 13:47-48): “in a cloth made of wool or linen fabric. In the warp or in the woof of the linen or the wool,” just as the cloth, when its work was completed, even the warp and the woof, when their work is completed. But the first Tanna/teacher holds, or with the warp, the matter was interrupted.
משישלק – in boiling water. But there are books that have the reading "משישלה", meaning to say that when they would be pulled/drawn out and transfer it from the dyer’s kettle when they boil them in it to whiten them.
והאונין של פשתן (bundles of wet flax) – bundles of yard of flax. But because the flax is not recognized between warp and woof like wool, because of this, there is no division in them between warp to woof.
משיתלבנו – that they place them in the oven so that they will heat up with the vapor of the oven and they be whitened/bleached there.
פקעת (coil of thread) – wood that the women surround the yarn from the reed used as a spindle into it.
כדי לארוג ממנה שלש על שלש – in order that there be there the measurement to make all of the cloth of three fingerbreadths by three fingerbreadths from it, also the warp [and] also the woof, as it is taught [in the Mishnah], “and even it is all warp, even if all of it is woof.”
היתה פסיקות (broken threads) – that the threads in the coil of thread were broken, there is no attachment. But if they are knotted, there is attachment.
אפילו פסיקה אחת – that there isn’t throughout all of the coil of thread other than one tear and he knotted it, it is not an attachment. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Yehuda..

Mishnah 9

המעלה מן הפקעת (one who winds thread from one coil to another) – sometimes when women make a coil of thread a cubit [in length] or two cubits [in length], and rolls and surrounds from one to the other to make a large coil, if before she winds all of it, a plague appears on one of them, and the thread fastens them, the second is pure.

השני טהור – that it was not an attachment.
וכן שני דפי לחוק (and similarly, the two wings of a shirt) – also are not an attachment. And they are not similar to tour shirts that we cut and attach to it the sleeves and the other pieces with a stitch of a complete attachment, for that is definitely considered attaching as if it is one cloth, but we are speaking that they are not attached all that much.
בנפש המסכת (the woof of the standing loom) – the thread of the woof that enters into the warp like the soul into the body, and until that settles on their defined place near that which is woven it is like the warp to combine with it to a plague like a split [Cilician] bean. Alternatively, at the outset, when he weaves in it the two portions of he web produced by passing the spool with the woof across the warp prior to weaving in it three [fingerbreadths] by three [fingerbreadths].
בשתי העומד (the standing warp) – they are the threats of the warp that are between the upper beam and the lower beam, the roller on which the web is wound as it advances, that stands there to be woven and to anoint them the threads of the woof. And this comes to tell us that it does not say that each and every thread stands on its own and that it doesn’t have the width of a split [Cilician] bean, but rather all of it is attached one to the other. But if a plague (also) appears on this side, it is impure on the other side.
אם היה רצוף (if he warp – on the loom – is joined closely – the threads being properly arranged) – that the threads are joined closely one next to the other like a cobweb/block pavement, for such is the manner of the weavers to arrange them so that their weaving is corresponding, then it is considered attachment. But if not like this, we view each thread as if it stands on its own and it is not an attachment. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Shimon.

ואפילו הן ארגמן – that you should not say that it doesn’t protect other than when the hims are of a different species that doesn’t defile with plagues as for example, of silk or of gold, which comes to teach us, that even if they are of purple [wool] which is colored wool it protects.

Mishnah 11

כל הראוי ליטמא טמא מת – with wool or flax or with skins.
אע"פ שאינו מיטמא מדרס – such as a cloth of three [fingerbreadths] by three [fingerbreadths], that is not defiled by threading until it has three handbreadths by three handbreadths, and it becomes susceptible to be defiled through contact with a corpse, and all the more so, that everything that becomes susceptible to become defiled through treading becomes susceptible to become defiled through plagues, as long as it is white things that are not colored.
קלע של ספינה ווילון וכו' (sail of a ship and a curtain/veil) – all of these are considered that they are susceptible to be defiled through corpse uncleanness but they are not susceptible to be defiled through treading.

באריג ובמוכין (on the web and on a soft spongy substance/hackled wool, rag) – on the body of the cloak/cover of hair and on the hairs that protrude from it. And the Halakha is according to Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov.
החמת והתורמל (the waterskin and the shepherd’s leather wallet) – vessels of leather, and they tie them and the leather is folded in the place of the knot, and the plague is in its folds is not seen unless the leather is spread out. And for this it is taught [in the Mishnah]: "נראין כדרכן"/and they are examined in their usual way, meaning to say, that they don’t spread them out, but rather he (i.e., the Kohen) sees it as such as it is . the waterskin, and leather bottle/skin. The תורמל – is like a kind of large leather pocket that the shepherd places his belongings into it.
מתוכו לאחוריו ([and it spreads] from its inside to its outer surface) – if from the outset the plague appears from in its insides, and he was shut up/quarantined, and at the end of the week, the plague appears on its outer surface, it is considered spreading. But n the Tosefta (Tractate Negaim, Chapter 5, Halakha 5:14) it implies, that we are speaking here especially with hides but not with clothing.

Mishnah 12

כולם טהורים – that which is definite it defiles, but it doesn’t defile that which is doubtful.

חוץ משל נכרים – if they purchased a chouse in the Land of Israel. For such is implied, "אחוזתכם"/[in the land] you possess (Leviticus 14:34) is susceptible to be defiled by plagues, but the possession of heathens is not susceptible to be defiled by plagues. And just as their possession is not susceptible to be defiled by plagues, so their clothes and their bodies are not susceptible to be defiled by plagues.

ובאסקריא (mast, yard – where the captain sits for looking out, raft) – it is the mast/yard of a ship. But there are books that the reading אכסדיא/raft and hey are the beams that they tie together and place them in the rivers and in the sea. And in the language of the Bible, they are called רפסודות (2 Chronicles 2:15): “[We undertake to cut down as many trees of Lebanon as you need, and deliver them to you] as rafts by sea to Jaffa; you will transport them to Jerusalem.”/"רפסדות על-ים יפו ואתה תעלה אתם ירושלם".
אינן מיטמאין בנגעים – as it is written (Leviticus 14:34): "בבית ארץ [אחזתכם]"/upon a house in the land that you possess”, until the house will be attached to the ground.
על ארבע קורות – like or on four beams. For the house was built on top of beams.
אפילו על ארבעה עמודים – for the pillars are attached to the ground and they are considered four corners to the house and the roof that is upon them is susceptible to being defiled through plagues and even though it is open from all of its sides.

בית שלא היו בו אבנים ועצים ועפר – all three of them, but rather, one of them was in it, and the plague appeared in that one, it is pure. For we require that it be appropriate to be made susceptible to uncleanness prior to seeing the plague.
עד שיהיו בו אבנים ועצים ועפר – as it is written (Leviticus 14:45): “[The house shall be torn down - ] its stones, and timber and all the coating on the house –[and taken to an impure place outside the city].”

או על אבל אחת – and that is the reason that Rabbi Yishmael stated four stones, for the four walls of the house, for each wall has one stone. But for Rabbi Akiba who stated, until that there should appear like [the size of] two split [Cilician] beans on two stones, not on one stone, for not less than eight stones, as each wall has two stones.
רבי אליעזר בר' שמעון אומר כו' – the reason of Rabbi Eliezer the son of Rabbi Shimon [Tractate Sanhedrin 71a] as it is written (Leviticus 14:37): "קיר" (i.e., "ומראיהן שפל מן-הקיר"/that appear to go deep in the wall) and it is written (Leviticus 14:37): "קירות" (i.e., "והנה הנגע בקירת הבית" /the plague in the walls of the house is found), What is a wall that is like multiple walls? He would say that this the corner, and in each wall, we require the measure of a plague, and that is like the split [Cilician] bean squared on each one. But the Halakha is according to Rabbi Akiba.

Mishnah 4

עצים – as we have stated (see Mishnah 2 of this chapter, that a house is not susceptible to be unclean until it has wood in it, how much [wood] will be in each and every wall. כדי ליתן תחת השקוף (as much wood as is needed to place under an arch/lintel – to keep it in shape)- thus it needs for each and every wall.
שקוף – place that the door arches/bends upon it, and they regularly place wood under it.
סנדל לאחורי השקוף – the regularly place wood for the back of the lintel to protect it, and it is called aסנדל /sandal [support] , like that the sandal protects/supports the foot. שקוף/arch or lintel, is called whether of the opening [of the house] or the window.

Mishnah 5

לא יגזור (will not decisively rule) –the judge will not make a legal ruling to state that it is a definitive plague, from as it is written (Leviticus 14:35): "[ובא אשר-לו בבית והיגד לכהן לאמר] כנגע נראה לי בבית"/ “[The owner of the house shall come and tell the priest, saying,] ‘Something like a plague has appeared upon my house,’” but it is not written [a definitive] נגע/plague (but rather, something like a plague).
אפילו חבילי עצים (and even bundles of wood) – which are not included in the uncleanness, one must remove. But as it is written (Leviticus 14:36): "ולא יטמא כל-אשר בבית" / “so that nothing in the house may become unclean,” that implies that the All-Merciful was stringent regarding uncleanness, Rabbi Yehuda holds that this is a matter on its own , to inform us that vessels that were initially also defiled, if he left them. But the Halakah is not according to Rabbi Yehuda.
עסק זה לפינוי – in astonishment, and to busy himself to empty out the house, Scripture needed that you must remove things that are not susceptible to receive defilement, by force, Scripture does not come to expound other than like Rabbi Meir expounds that the Torah has compassion on the money of Israelites.
פכו (his cruse) – the language of small cruses.
תפיו (to set upon for cooking/ewer) – a place that one makes and cooks on it his dishes, as for example, an earthenware oven and [an earthenware] double stove that ae susceptible to become unclean. But there are books that have the reading טפיו/his stand for a portable oven/dripping, and it is a very small earthenware vessel that the liquid does not leave from it other by constant dripping. And all of these do not have purification in a Mikveh.
וא"כ על של רשע – that the plagues come on account of gossip/evil talk.

Mishnah 6

אינו הולך לתוך ביתו – as it is written (Leviticus 14:38): “The priest shall come out of the house [to the entrance of the house, and close up the house for seven days].” It is possible that he would go to his house and shut it up, the inference teaches us (Leviticus 14:38): “to the entrance of the house”/"אל-פתח הבית", or on the entrance of the house, it is possible that he would stand underneath the lintel and shut it up, as the inference teaches us (Leviticus 14:38): “The priest shall come out of the house”/"ויצא הכהן מן-הבית" until he uproots from everything in the house (see also Tractate Nedarim 56b and Hullin 10b).
ולא סיד מכל מקום (and not lime from any place) – as it is written (Leviticus 14:42): “and take other coating ]and plaster the house[”/"ועפר אחר יקח [וטח את-הבית]", but he lime is not dirt, but rather burnt stone.
לא אחת תחת שתים – a large stone that replaces the place of the two [stones].
מכאן אמרו אוי לרשע ואוי לשכנו – if a wall interrupts between two houses and the plague appears on the wall on the side of this house, the owner of the other house has to deal with him on this, as it is written (Leviticus 14:40): “[The priest] shall order the stones with the plague in them to be pulled out”/"[וצוה הכהן] וחלצו את-האבנים אשר בהן הנגע", in the plural language (i.e., וחלצו את האבנים – they shall pull out the stones). And the one for whom the plague is on the side of his house is called an “evil” person, for plagues come on account of gossip/evil talk, as we have stated.
שניהם קוצעים (both of the neighbors must bear the expense for tearing out – the leprous stone, and for scraping the wall) – it is the language of (Leviticus 14:41): “The house shall be scraped inside all around”/”ואת-הבית יקצע מבית סביב" .
יקח וטח – it is singular language (Leviticus 14:42): "ועפר איר יקח וטח את-הבית"/ “and take other coating and plaster the house,” to exclude his neighbor that does not deal with him in plastering.

Mishnah 7

בא בסוף השבוע –(Leviticus 12:48): "אחרי הטח את-בית"/ “after the house was replastered,” he (i.e., the Kohen) returns and quarantines it/shuts it up, but if at the end of the week, the plague returns, “he tears down the house,”/"ונתץ את הבית" (Leviticus 12:45).
הפשיון הסמוך – that it spread close/adjacent to the plague.
והחוזר כשני גריסין – as it is written (Leviticus 14:43): "ואם-ישוב הנגע"/ “if the plague again breaks out in the house,” like a person who states: “so-and-so returned to his place.” But the plague that is in the houses at the outset do not other defile other than with two split [Cilician] beans in size.

Chapter 13

הכהה – at the end of the second week, and it goes away completely. Two others, that makes four.
הפושה בשבוע ראשון חולץ וקוצה וטח ונותן לו שבוע (if it spreads in the first week, he must tear out – the leprous stone – and scrape – the wall – and plaster and give it a week) – but if it (i.e., the plague) returned, he tears it down by chipping off his part of the house. This is five.
לא חזר טעון צפרים – this makes six.
עמד בעיניו בשבוע ראשון ופשה בשני חולץ וקוצה וטח ונותן לו שבוע – if it returned, he tears it down by chipping. This makes seven.

עמד בעיניו בשבוע ראשון ובשבוע שני, חולץ וקוצה וטח ונותן לו שבוע – that the law for remaining unchanged in the second week is like the law of spreading, if it returned, he tears it down by chipping. This is nine.
לא חזר טעון צפרים – this makes ten.
אם עד שלא טיהרו בצפרים נראה בו נגע – this is like [the plague] returns, and requires cutting out/breaking up, but from when he purifies it, it is for him like a new plague and he shuts it up/quarantines it.

Mishnah 2

האבן שבזוית – that is between him and his neighbor jointly.
חולץ את כולו – for when they (i.e., the Rabbis) expound "וחלצו /]“the priest shall order the stones with the plague in them] to be pulled out,” (Leviticus 13:40 – with a plural construction), teaching that both of them pull out/tear out [the stones].
בזמן שהוא נותץ (and at the time when he has to tear down – see Leviticus 13:45) – the entire house.
נותץ שלו – for concerning cutting out/breaking up, it is written (Leviticus 13:45): “its stones and timber”/”את אבניו ואת עציו" , its stones that are his and its timber that is his.
ראש ופתין (if a [twin] house is built with cross-beam and king-beam/principal beam common to both compartments) – it explains in the Arukh, that particular stone or that piece of wood that takes hold from the western side of the course of stones is his, and of the eastern side, the course of stones is his neighbors, he put the stone or that piece of wood is the cross beam. And those stones and pieces of wood that are in this course of stones on the west is one, and that course of stones in the east is one, for they are from the principal beam common to both compartments.

Mishnah 3

נותן את הקורות לעלייה – and he supports them with pillars and does not tear them down with the house, as it is written (Leviticus 13:45): “its stones and timber and all the coating on the house”/את-אבניו ואת-עציו ואת כל-עפר הבית", but not the stones and timber and coating of the upper story.
נתצין עמו (are torn down with it) – for [the Rabbis] expound on: "את-אבניו ואת-עציו ואת כל-עפר הבית"/ “its stones and timber and all the coating on the house” (Leviticus 13:45), all the stones that were built with it and all the pieces of wood that were built with it and all of the coating that was built with it,” for since there is no upper story on top it, all of them were built with it.
מלבנים (a casing to protect that portion of the beam which rests on the wall) – kinds of square bricks that one spreads out/stretches on the roofs. But there are those who explain that they are similar to door-posts that they make in windows from the outside for beauty, but they are not attached with plaster on the window.
שריגות (lattices) – like a kind of net-work that they make in the window that they look out from there to the public domain.
מלבן (frame)– a long piece of wood that is on the wall that is made to hold upon it the heads of the beams that they should not rot from the moisture of the wall.

Mishnah 4

בית המוסגר מטמא מתוכו – as it is written (Leviticus 14:46): “Whoever enters the house while it is closed up shall be impure until evening.” But the leprous stones themselves, even when locked up, defile from their outsides.
והמוחלט מתוכו ומאחוריו – a person who touches/comes in contact with a house from its outside, is impure. As it is written regarding a [house] that is certified unclean (Leviticus 14:44): "צרעת ממארת היא בבית טמא הוא"/”it is a malignant eruption in the house; it is impure.” What does the inference of "טמא הוא" /”it is impure” teach us? It adds that a person is impure whether from the inside or whether from the outside.
זה וזה מטמאין בביאה – to defile all who enters inside of it.

Mishnah 5

הבונה מן המוסגר בטהור – after he had torn out and scraped and [re-] plastered and gave it a week, within the days of [the house] being shut up he took from that same house stones and built them in another house.
וחזר נגע לבית – that was shut up/quarantined.
חולץ את האבנים – that he took from it, and removes them from the pure [house], and they are impure like the uncleanness of the house that he took them from.
חזר הנגע לאבנים – that he built in the pure [new] house.
הבית – that is shut up, should be torn down/chipped off, as if they were fixed in it. And they stones also require tearing out, but that we wait for them until they will serve in the second house [for the purpose of inspecting whether] tokens [of uncleanness recur in the second house] , that require shutting up/quarantining , and its law for every manner like every house in which a plague appears at the outset.

Mishnah 6

בית שהוא מיסך על גבי בית המנוגע – as for example, that the house that is certified as leprous is built within another house. And similarly, a tree that the leprous house is built underneath it.
הנכנס לחיצון טהור – for this one stands alone and that one stands alone. And it is similar to a house and the upper story, for if leprosy is in the house, the upper story is pure.
ומה אם אבן אחת – that is from the house with leprosy, which defiles all that is in the tent.
הבית כולו – that is underneath another house, all the more so that it would defile all that is within the outer house. And the Halakha is according to Rabbi Eliezer (see also Tractate Negaim, Chapter 11, Mishnah 6).

Mishnah 7

והטהור עובר טמא – as it is written regarding the leper (Leviticus 13:46): “[Being impure, he shall dwell apart;] his dwelling shall be outside the camp.”/ "מחוץ למחנה מושבו" , from here that his dwelling is impure, therefore, when the impure individual stands underneath the tree, the place of the tree becomes his dwelling place and the pure person that passes there is impure. But when the impure person passes and doesn’t stand to rest himself, this is not called his dwelling, and even though that the pure person sits there, the pure person is not susceptible to receive defilement.
ואם עמד – the impure person, the place of the tree is defiled and the pure person is defiled who passes there.
וכן באבן המנוגע – if a person who carries it (i.e., a leprous stone) passes underneath the tree, the pure person standing there is not defiled.
ואם הניחה טמא – and the same law applies even if he did not place it down, but rather that the person carrying it stood.

Mishnah 8

טהור שהכניס ראשו ורובו – for less than one’s head and the majority of one’s body is not considered coming in.
שהכניס ממנה שלש אצבעות על שלש אצבעות – it is considered as if all of the cloak had entered. But not less than this, for less than three [fingerbreadths] by three [fingerbreadths] is not susceptible to receive defilement and is not considered.
וטמאה – as for example, a cloak afflicted with leprosy that an olive’s bulk of it entered into a pure house.
טמאתו – for an analogy is made between leprosy and a corpse. But a leprous cloak that became defiled through oming in, we derive if from Scripture, as it is written (Leviticus 14:55): “for an eruption on a cloth or a house.”/"ולצרעת הבגד והבית", an analogy is made from a cloth to a house, for just as aa house defiles when one enters it, for it is written (Leviticus 14:46): “Whoever enters the house”/"והבא אל הבית וגו' ", even a cloth defiles through entry. From where do we learn that this includes everything as for example warp and woof and hides, the inference teaches us (Leviticus 13:59): "זאת תורת נגע-צרעת בגד הצמר [או הפשתים או השתי או הערב או כל כלי-עור לטהרו או לטמאו]."/ “Such is the procedure for eruptive affections of cloth, [woolen or linen, in warp or in woof, or of any article of skin, for pronouncing it pure or impure.],” an analogy is made between all of them to a cloth, just as a cloth defiles through entry, so all of them defile through entry.

Mishnah 9

וכליו על כתפו – folded and placed on his shoulder in the manner of a burden [to carry].
וטבעותיו בידיו – placed in the palm of his hand that is not according to the manner of dressing.
הוא והן טמאין מיד – for we call them also with vessels (Leviticus 14:46): “Whoever enters the house [while it is closed up] shall be impure [until evening].”/"והבא אל-הבית...יטמא" .
היה לבוש כליו – that now his vessels ae not impure, other than on account of himself.
והן טהורים עד שישהה בכדי אכילת פרס – as it is written (Leviticus 14:47): “Whoever sleeps in the house must wash his clothes, and whoever eats in the house must wash his clothes.” And it is taught in a Baraita: I have established only eating and sleeping, but from where can I derive that not eating or not sleeping [is included]? The inference comes to teach us, "יכבס את-בגדיו"/he must wash his clothes – is an inclusion (i.e., widening the scope of the Halakha), if so, why does it state (in Leviticus 14:47): "השכב בבית...והאכל בבית"/one who sleeps in the house….and one who eats in the house? To give a measurement to (Leviticus 13:46): "והבא אל-הבית"/whoever enters the house, which does not require washing of clothes until he remains there long enough eats while he is lying down, meaning to say, when he is reclining. And how much is the measurement of eating? In order to eat a piece of bread, which is one-half of a loaf of an Eruv (see Tractate Eruvin 8b and the dispute between Rashi and Maimonides; according to Rabbi Yohanan ben Beroka, a full loaf is six eggs and half of it is three eggs; according to Rabbi Shimon, the loaf is eight eggs and half of it is four eggs; Maimonides decides according to Rabbi Yohanan ben Beroka, whereas Rashi decides like Rabbi Shimon). According to the words of Rashi, they are four eggs, and according to the words of Maimonides they are three eggs.
מיסב ואוכלן בלפתן (sits and eats them with their condiments) – that its measure is less than if he [would] eat them without their condiments, that through the taste of their condiments, he hurries to eat.

Mishnah 10

היה עומד בפנים – within the leprous house.
ופשט ידיו לחוץ וטבעותיו בידיו – here we are speaking that his rings are on his fingers like he wears them, and if he delayed in order to eat a piece of bread, they are impure, for they are clinging to his body, but if they were in the palm of his hand in the manner of burden, the Tosefta (Tractate Negaim, Chapter 7, Halakha 9) proves that they are impure immediately.
בזמן שאין כל גופו טמא – as for example, here when he stands outside and he is not defiled all the while that he did not put his head and the greater part of his body inside.
אינו דין שלא יטמא מה שעליו עד שישהה כדי אכילת פרס – And Rabbi Yehuda states, we found that the power of something impure to protect is greater than the power of something pure to protect, for an Israelite when they become susceptible to impurity, they protect vessels in the leprous house, for they don’t defile until he remains enough time to eat a piece of bread, but the heathen and cattle which are not susceptible to receive impurity, they do not protect vessels in a leprous house, for the clothing that is upon them are impure immediately. But the Halakha Is not according to Rabbi Yehuda.

Mishnah 11

עד ארבע אמות – Rabbi Shimon holds that above four cubits is another domain, for the height of an average person is three cubits, and one cubit is for the prostration accompanied by stretched of hands and feet. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Shimon.
כלים מיד טמאים – meaning to say, vessels that we stated even up until the beams according to the first Tanna/teacher, and until four cubits according to Rabbi Shimon, immediately become susceptible to impurity when he enters with them into the leprous house.
כדי הדלקת הנר – when he enters with permission, Rabbi Yehuda agrees/admits that the become susceptible to impurity immediately, but he doesn’t dispute other than when he enters without permission, because the dwelling of a leper defiles as we stated (earlier in this Mishnah), and when he enters with permission it is his dwelling immediately, but when he enters without permission, it is not his dwelling unless he remains enough time to light a candle and it doesn’t go out. But if he didn’t remain enough time in order to light a candle, it is not his dwelling, and that fact that [the master] throw him out is because he was preoccupied in lighting the candle because it was the onset of the Sabbath or on weekdays, and he was not able to bring it forth.

Mishnah 12

נכנס בית הכנסת – a leper that comes to enter into a synagogue.
עושים לו מחיצה גבוהה עשרה טפחים – for less than ten [handbreadths] is not considered a partition to protect.
ברוחב ארבע אמות – corresponding to the four cubits of prayer (see Tractate Berakhot 31b). Alternatively, because this is the measurement of the place of a person, as we stated in [Tractate] Eruvin, in the chapter מי שהוציאוהו /He who took forth beyond the Sabbath limits [folio 48a].
נכנס ראשון ויוצא אחרון – in order that those who are standing in the synagogue do not become defiled through his entrance and his departure, when he passes from the entrance until the partition, for we are concerned lest he stand a bit at the time that he passes, and all of those standing there will be defiled.
כל המציל בצמיד פתיל – as for example an earthenware vessel and all of those are considered in Tractate Kelim in Chapter 10: “Which are the vessels that are protected by a tightly fitting lid?”
כל המציל מכוסה אוהל המת – such as a pit and a cistern that don’t require a tightly fit lid but rather a covering, as is taught in Tractate Ahilot, Chapter 5 [The Oven] (Mishnah 6). And the Halakha is according to Rabbi Yossi.

Chapter 14



Mishnah 1

כיצד מטהרין. פיילי (a broad, flat bowl) – a bowl (out of which the sprinkling is done). (Amos 6:6): “They drink [straight] from the wine bowls [And anoint themselves with the choicest oils – But they are not concerned about the ruin of Joseph],” which we translate into Aramaic, that they drink from bowls of wine.
חדשה – as it is written (Leviticus 14:5): “[The priest shall order one of the birds of slaughtered] over fresh water in an earthen vessel.”/"[וצוה הכהן ושחט את-הצפור האחת] אל-כלי-חרש על-מים חיים. An analogy is made between a vessel to water. Just as water that no work had been done with it, even a vessel that no work had been done with it.
רביעית – because it is written (Leviticus 14:6): “[and dip them together with the live bird] in the blood of the bird that was slaughtered over the fresh water,” living water that the blood of the bird is recognized in them. And the Sages estimated/measured it as a quarter-log [of living water].
מים חיים – that always flows and doesn’t stop.
צפרים דרור (undomesticated birds/free birds) – that live in the house as they do in the field (see also Psalms 84:4 and Proverbs 26:2).
וקוברה לפניו – because it is prohibited for deriving benefit.
ושני תולעת (scarlet-dyed yarn) – it is the language of scarlet colored wool. KARMAZI in the foreign language.
וכרכן בשיירי לשון (and bound them together with the ends of the strip of wool) – the cedar wood, hyssop and crimson stuff (i.e., wool), he would place them together, and the strip would go out and be a surplus over the cedar wood and hyssop, and he would bind them together so that all three of them would be in one band.
והקיף – the language of proximity and bringing close. Like [Tractate Betzah 32b, Chapter 4, Mishnah 5]: They bring two jars together, to give the heave-offering that is not from that which is surrounded, meaning to say that he would place adjacent to them the tips of the wings and the head of the tail of the living [second] bird, and immerse all of them together in blood and in water that is the earthenware vessel.
לאחר ידו – on the back of the hand of the leper.
ויש אומרים על מצחו – but the Halakha is not according to those who say [to sprinkle it on his forehead].
על השקוף – of the house that is plagued/leprous.

Mishnah 2

לא לים – if he is in a city that sits on the border of the sea.
ולא למדבר – if the city sits near the wilderness/desert.
שנאמר ושלח את הצפור החיה אל מחוץ לעיר אל פני השדה – from here that he does not turn his face towards the city.
העביר תער על כל בשרו – not exactly. For he would not shave other than every place where there is a gathering of hair, [and it appears, to exclude the hair of] the covered parts of the body/posterior, for Scripture states (Leviticus 14:9): “On the seventh day he shall shave off all his hair,” – a generalization; “of head, beard and eyebrows” – a detail; “When he has shaved off all his hair,” he returned and made a generalization, the application of the Halakha under discussion is limited to items somewhat similar to the detail, just as the detail is explained, a place where hair is gathered and appears, even every place where there is a gathering of hair and it appears. But the first shaving that he shaves at the time of his certification as a leper, we learn it through a verbal analogy from the second shaving, that he shaves a second time after he counted seven days, for it states during the days of his being a certified leper (Leviticus 14:8), “[The one to be purified shall wash his clothes,] shave off all his hair, [and bathe in water; then he shall be pure], etc., and it states in the days of his counting that he shall shave all his hair, etc. (see above). Just as shaving during the days of his counting, except in the covered parts of the body/posterior, even the shaving that is stated during the days of his completion, excluding the covered parts of the body/posterior.
טהור מלטמא בביאה – and to defile through lying and sitting, in the manner that he would defile in the days of his being a certified leper.
מטמא כשרץ – to defile a person and clothing through contact, but not through carrying.
מנודה בביתו – for this matter that he is prohibited to engage in sexual relations, as it is written (Leviticus 14:8): “but he must remain outside his tent [seven days],” but [the word], "אהלו"/his tent is none other than his wife. And similarly it states (Deuteronomy 5:27): “[Go, say to them,] ‘Return to your tents,’” that Moses permitted to them sexual relations after the Revelation of Mount Sinai.

Mishnah 3

טהור מלטמא כשרץ – ‘but he invalidates heave-offering [and nothing more].
ושלש טהרות כיולדת – and the same law applies to a person with gonorrhea who had three attacks and concerning a woman who had a flux, that in all of them, he immersed [in a Mikveh] and came up, he eats [Second] Tithe. When his (i.e., the leper’s seventh day) sun has set, he eats heave offering. When he brought his atonement sacrifice, he eats Holy Things. These are three purifications. And that it (i.e., the Mishnah) took that of the woman in childbirth, it is written explicitly (Leviticus 12:8): “The priest shall make expiation on her behalf, and she shall be pure, [if married to a Kohen), for the eating of Holy Things.

Mishnah 4

והלוים – at the time that they chosen for service in the wilderness (see Numbers 8:7: “[This is what you shall do to purify them: sprinkle on them water of purification,] and let them go over their whole body with a razor, [and wash their clothes; thus they shall be purified].”), but it does not apply for all generations.

Mishnah 5

מצותן שיהיו שוות – for the All-Merciful writes, “birds”/צפרים (i.e., Leviticus 14:4: “The priest shall order two live birds…to be brought to him for him who is to be purified.”) and the least of [the plural of] “birds” is two. The two [birds] that the All-Merciful wrote [in the Torah], why do I need it? But rather to teach that both of them should be equal.
ונמצאת טריפה כו' – for it is written "חיות" /live (see Leviticus 14:4: “The priest shall order two live pure birds"/"שתי צפרים חיות טהרות" , excluding those which are defective/having a fatal organic disease.
תמות המשתלח – it should be left until it dies on its own.

Mishnah 6

כרביע כרע המטה – as it explains further on, that he divides he leg of the bed into two [parts], and these two he divides them into four. And this is the quarter of the leg [of the bed]. And this comes to teach us that the commandment is to define exactly, that it will be one-quarter of a leg [in thickness] not less and not more.
שם לווי (a surname, epithet – nor any hyssop which is qualified by an epithet)– that they escort and attach it to something else, the Greek hyssop, the stibium hyssop and the Roman hyssop.

Mishnah 7

ביום השמיני –(referring to Leviticus 14:10: “On the eight day he shall take two male lambs without blemish, one ewe lamb in its first year without blemish, three-tenths of a measure of choice flour with oil mixed in for a grain offering, and one LOG of oil.”) When he shaved on the seventh day, he brings his sacrifices (i.e., sin offering, guilt-offering and burnt offering) on the eighth [day]. But if he delayed and didn’t shave other than on the eighth [day], he brings his sacrifices on the ninth [day], because it requires the setting of the sun between shaving and the bringing of his sacrifices.

Mishnah 8

וסמך שתי ידיו עליו – but prior to laying his hands upon it, it requires waving, for the guilt offering of a leper requires waving/shaking it live (see Leviticus 14:24: “The priest shall take the lamb of reparation offering – i.e., the guilt offering – and the LOG of oil, and elevate them as an elevation offering before the LORD"/"והניף אתם הכהן תנופה לפני ה'" ).
ואחד ביד – as it is written (Leviticus 14:14): “The priest shall take some of the blood of the reparation offering (i.e., the guilt offering) and the priest shall put it on the ridge of the right ear of him who is being purified l[and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot].” Just as the placing is done by the Kohen’s essence himself, even the receiving [of the blood] is done by the Kohen essence himself.
אינו צריך טבילה – for he had already immersed the previous evening, as it is written (Leviticus 14:9): “On the seventh day he shall shave off all his hair…he shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water.” But the Sages state, for since he is likely to [be susceptible for] uncleanness, lest he did not guard himself properly in purity and became defiled after he immersed [in a Mikveh], therefore he requires another immersion from doubt. But the Halakha is according to the Sages.

Mishnah 9

הכניס ראשו (he put his head inside) – because someone who requires a ceremony of atonement does not enter in the Israelite courtyard, and the blood of the guilt-offering (i.e., reparation offering) was invalidated by leaving if he went outside of the courtyard, therefore, the leper would stand in the Gate of Nikanor which was between the Courtyard of the Women and the Courtyard of the Israelites, but he puts his head inside the courtyard until they place the gifts on his earlobe, and he puts his hand and foot in until he (i.e., the Kohen) places it (i.e., the blood) on his right thumb and right big-toe.
תנוך (the ridge) – this is the middle partition of an ear.
רבי יהודה אומר וכו' – but the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Yehuda.
אין לו טהרה עולמית – for we require as it is written in Scripture. And especially that his ear was lopped off/mutilated or his [right] thumbs/big toes after they were made dependent upon purification.
רבי אליעזר אומר נותן הוא על מקומו (Rabbi Eliezer states: He puts It (i.e., the blood) on their place) – for we don’t require it as it is written in Scripture. But the Halakha is not according to Rabi Eliezer. And similarly, the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Shimon who stated that if he put it on his left [thumb and left toe] he has fulfilled his obligation.

Mishnah 10

נטל מלוג השמן – that he brought up the LOG [of oil] with the guilt-offering in the place of its slaughtering in the north and it was designated there.
לתוך כפו של חבירו – as it is written (Leviticus 14:15): “[The priest shall take some of the LOG of oil] and pour it into palm of the Kohen’s [left hand], which implies that the Kohen who is doing the sprinkling would pour into the palm of another Kohen.
כנגד בית קדשי הקדשים – because it states (Leviticus 14:16): “seven times before the LORD.” But he would not bring in the oil to sprinkle opposite the curtain, but rather he would stand in the Courtyard and would turn his face to the side of the House of the Holy of Holies and would sprinkle on the ground of the Courtyard.
על כל הזאה טבילה (for every sprinkling is a [corresponding] dipping [of the finger]) – for every time that he sprinkles, he dips his finger in the oil, but not that he would dip his finger one time and sprinkle from that dipping two or three sprinklings, for seven times, refers to the dipping of the finger as well.
בין שנתן בין שלא נתן כיפר – and the person is pure.
ומעלין עליו כאילו לא כיפר (but so far as the priest is concerned, it is credited to him as if he didn’t make atonement) – before Heaven, for he did not perform the commandment in the best way. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri.
חסר הלוג – the oil of the leper.
עד שלא יצק (before he poured it out) – to his left palm, he should fill it. But we don’t say that the LOG was established for him which are the sacred vessels.
עד שלא נתן – seven gifts. For Rabbi Shimon holds that the giving of the seven [sprinklings] establishes it, and not the pouring. But the Halakah is not according to Rabbi Shimon.

Mishnah 11

הכל הולך אחר החטאת – for in the sin-offering and the burnt offering, the rich and poor are divided/separated, that the rich brings from the cattle, and the poor brings from the fowl, two turtle-doves or two pigeons, therefore, if at the time of the offering of the sin-offering, he was poor and he brought the sin offering of fowl, even though he became rich afterwards, he would supplement the sacrifice of the poor person and bring the burnt offering of a fowl. And similarly, if he was rich and he brought the sin-offering of cattle, even though he became poor, he needs to bring the burnt offering of cattle.
רבי יהודה אומר אחר האשם – that with regard to the guilt-offering, the poor and rich are equivalent, and it is the first of the sacrifices of the leper, and designated for his purification more than all others. And both of them are expounded upon from one Scriptural verse, as it is written (Leviticus 14:32): "אשר לא-תשיג ידו בטהרתו"/”and whose means for his purification are limited,” Rabbi Shimon holds that that which procures atonement for him, and that is the sin-offering. But Rabbi Yehuda holds the thing that makes him fit and purifies him, and that is the guilt-offering. And the Halakha is according to Rabbi Yehuda.

Mishnah 12

שהביא קרבן עשיר יצא – [even ab initio he brings] and a blessing should come upon him [by bringing a sacrifice that is above his means]. And since it (i.e., the Mishnah) requires to teach in the concluding clause (i.e., that a rich leper cannot bring the sacrifice designated for a poor leper) that he does not fulfill his obligation, the first clause teaches that he fulfills his obligation.
מביא אדם על [ידי] בנו ובתו – even though he is rich, he brings for them the sacrifice of a poor person if they are poor. And this sacrifice purifies them to eat Holy Things, as we stated (see Mishnah 3 of this chapter) he brought his atonement, he eats Holy Things.
אף על ידי אשתו מביא קרבן עשיר – for his wife is like his body, he cannot bring for her the sacrifice of a poor person if he is rich. And not only the sacrifice of the leper alone, but the same law applies to every sacrifice that she is liable for, he does not bring on her account a sacrifice for a poor person if he is rich.

Mishnah 13

זאת שאלו אנשי אלכסנדריא את ר' יהושע – the second leper who is living, what happens to him, how can he become pure to eat Holy Things, for if the other leper were living, even though their [bird] sacrifices were mixed up, this one (i.e., Kohen) would offer up in the name of someone and the other (i.e., Kohen) would offer up in the name of someone. Or if one of them had died, and there were two sacrifices before us, there were the sacrifices of the dead and this one would offer the other sacrifice. But now, he is not able to offer this, for perhaps it is of the dead person and it the sin-offering of the person who owned it, and it went to death. But the other sacrifice he also is not able to bring, for perhaps the one that was offered was his and he is exempted, and it is found that he brings non-holy animals to the courtyard. And he is not able to make a condition with a free-will offering, for the sin-offering does not come as a free-will offering.
יכתוב נכסיו לאחר – for he is a poor person and it is appropriate to bring the sacrifice of a poor person, but the sin-offering of fowl comes on the doubt, and there isn’t anything in it because of non-holy offerings in the Courtyard. But if he doesn’t make his possessions ownerless and he brought the sin-offering of a fowl, he was not purified, for a rich person who brought a sacrifice of a poor person did not fulfill his obligation. But from the guilt-offering that he brings, one is not able to bring an raise a question about how one is able to bring a guilt-offering in a case of doubt, perhaps he brings non-holy animals to the Courtyard, for since his gifts for the guilt-offering are equivalent to the peace offerings, he can bring a guilt-offering and make a stipulation, if I am liable for a guilt offering, this should be for a guilt-offering, but if not, that my guilt offering was offering, this should be for a peace-offering, what he is not able to do regarding a sin-offering for the sprinkling/smearing of blood of a sin-offering is not equivalent to a peace offering, for the sprinkling of blood of a sin-offering [four “gifts”] is [sprinkled] above the red line (i.e., painted in red and encircling the Temple altar at precisely half its height), but peace offerings [of two “gifts”] is below the red line.
