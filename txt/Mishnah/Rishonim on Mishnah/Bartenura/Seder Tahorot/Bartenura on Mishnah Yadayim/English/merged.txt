Bartenura on Mishnah Yadayim



Chapter 1



Mishnah 1

מי רביעית - water that has in it the measurement of one-quarter of a LOG, which is an egg-and-a-half [in volume].
נותנים לידים לאחד אף לשנים – for one [person] we require ab initio one-quarter of a LOG. Even for two [people] if there was in it from the outset a quarter of a LOG and the first [person] poured [water over his hands] and afterwards the second [person], even though there wasn’t a quarter [of a LOG] for the second [person], it is all right, since they come from the remnants of purity (see Talmud Hullin 107a). But Maimonides [brings] an explanation, that specifically it is water for the second pouring [i.e., pouring water on the hands prior to consuming Terumah/heave offering (for a Kohen)] that we don’t we require a quarter of a LOG for each person, since his hands had already been purified from the first rinsing, but the first pouring, there cannot be less than one-quarter of a LOG for each person. But my Masters/Teachers did not explain it thusly.
מחצית לוג לשלשה או לארבעה – according to the measurement of one-quarter of a LOG for two [people], it would be enough to have one-quarter of LOG plus a half [of that amount] for three [people], but since that are a greater number of people, we are concerned lest they are not exacting well to pour [water only] up to the joint , for each person defines exactly regarding [how much he uses] because of his fellow. However, if there is one-quarter of a LOG and a half an the first [person] from them poured one-half of one-quarter of a LOG, the remaining one-quarter of a LOG will be sufficient for the two others, for even at the outset, it is enough for two [people] with one-quarter [of a LOG], all the more so now that they come from to leave over/preserve ritual purity. But if it was not done/take effect from this, these words [apply] were there didn’t remain one-quarter [of a LOG of water] for the last two [people].
ובלבד שלא יפחות לאחרון שבהן מרביעית – that there will be in the vessel one-quarter of a LOG at the time when the last person pours water on his hands/ritually washes them. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Yossi.
מוסיפין על השניים ואין מוסיפין על הראשונים – the law of pouring water on/washing the hands that requires washing the hands until the joint, and after he washed his hands with one pouring even though his hands are pure if he wiped them with a napkin, nevertheless, if he goes back and touches the water that is on the napkin, his hands are impure, and if a loaf of Terumah/heave-offering came in contact with them, it is impure, and therefore, it is the practice that he does another pouring of water to purify the first waters that are upon his hands, but now it is stated that if he placed water a second time but they didn’t reach the joint, he is able to add upon them and to pour water from a place that he didn’t pour there initially, and the first waters that are upon his hands are purified. But on the first waters, if they didn’t reach the joint, he is not able to add, but rather he must dry his hands and return and pour water at once that they should reach the joint.

Mishnah 2

בכלי גללים – vessels/utensils that are made from the dung of cattle, but they are not considered vessels regarding the matter of defilement.
לא בדפנות הכלים ולא בשולי המחץ (not with the sides of [broken] utensils nor with the sides of a broken ladle) – because they are broken vessels.
ולא במגופת החבית (nor with the bung/stopper for utensils) – for it is not used within it other than as a cover for the barrel.
בחפניו (with his cupped hands) – that he should not fill his cupped hands with water and pour on the hands of his fellow.
שאין ממלאים -drawing potable running spring water to sanctify with them the waters of purification of the ashes of the Red Heifer, for a vessel is required, as it is written (Numbers 19:17): “[Some of the ashes from the fire of cleansing shall be taken from the unclean person,] and fresh water shall be added to them in a vessel” (see Tractate Parah, Chapter 5, Mishnah 5).
ואין מקדשין – placing the ashes on top of the water.
ואין מזין – that the hyssop is immersed in a vessel in order to sprinkle it.
צמיד פתיל – the shards of an earthenware vessel that he surrounded with a closely covered lid and placed in the tent of a corpse, they don’t save what is inside them.
שאין מצילין – like, “and they do’ save,” and its example is in the first chapter of [Tractate] Betzah [8a], that the ashes of a portable stove on feet [with caves for two pots] is ready. And they explained in the Gemara {Tractate Betzah 8a), this is what he said: that the ashes of the portable stove on feet are ready.
מיד כלי חרס- if an unclean reptile fill within an earthenware vessel, everything that is in its airspace is defiled except for the utensils and a human being which are not defiled from the airspace of an earthenware vessel, as it is written (Leviticus 11:33-34): “[And if any of those falls into an earthen vessel,] everything inside it shall be unclean [and -the vessel – itself you shall break]. As to any food that may be eaten, [it shall become unclean if It came in contact with water],” food and liquids become are defiled from the airspace of an earthenware vessel, but human beings and vessels are not defiled from the airspace of earthenware vessels. But if shards of vessels are placed in an earthenware oven and an unclean reptile is in the oven, the shards do not save the foods that are within it (see also Tractate Kelim, Chapter 8, Mishnah 3).

Mishnah 3

שנפסלו משתיית בהמה - as for example, on account of offensive smell/stench. But if it became unfit on account of plaster/mud/clay, even in the ground, it is unfit.
בכלים פסולים – for the Rabbis did not establish pouring [water on the hands] other than with what appropriate for animals to drink.
בקרקע כשרים – to ritually immerse the hands for purification, for they are a Mikveh and one immerses in them all of his body, his hands is it not all the more so?
קומוס (gum, resin) – GUMA in the foreign language.
וקנקנתום (vitriol, shoe-black) - VIDRIOLI. And it shines like a kind of glass/crystal.
עשה בהן מלאכה או ששרה בהן פתו פסולין - because he abolished them and they became changed from the category of water.
אפילו נתכוין לשרות בזה – with astonishment. And even if he intended to soak his bread in one place and it fell into another place, they would be unfit, for didn’t he not intend and did not abolish them? But rather, they are definitely kosher/fit. But the Halakah is not according to Rabbi Shimon the Temani.

Mishnah 4

או שמיחה בהן את המדות (or he scrubbed measures in it) – the moistness that became attached to them, and they don’t leave other than with force. For this reason, it teaches the language of מיחוי/cleansing, like "מיחוי קרביו"/the cleansing of the bowels that is taught in the Mishnah of [Tractate] Pesahim, in the chapter [six – 68a]: “these things.”
פוסל בחדשים – for even though they are clean, it is not customary to use them until he rinses them first. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Yossi.

Mishnah 5

גלוסקין (a white and delicate bread) – loaves of clean and pure bread.
ואם הדיח בהן ידיו – and plasters/covers the white and delicate bread in his hand.
כשרים – the water that are in the vessel [are kosher] for pouring [to wash with], for no work was done with the water that is in the vessel other than with the water that he took with the hollow of his hand.
מניח חבית בין ברכיו -and with his knees they assist him to pour, that is the power/strength of the person, and because of this, Rabbi Yossi does not dispute this.
ומטה חבית על צדה – and even if he went and sat himself down afterwards, and the jug pours out water all day long, on account of his being inclined, and it is considered the strength/power of a person.
והקוף – a beast whose name is MONA (APE) in the foreign tongue. And it has hands like the hands of a human.
נוטל לידים – we require the power of the one who gives; the power/strength of a human is not needed.
רבי יוסי פוס בשני אלו – with the ape, and with the turning the jar on its sides. The ape, because we require the strength of a human and we lack that, and setting the jar on its side, is not the considered the power/strength of a person. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Yossi.

Chapter 2



Mishnah 1

נטל את ידו משטיפה אחת – we call it one rinsing all the while that he didn’t pour other than on one hand until the joint/wrist, and it is sufficient once with his one hand, even though there isn’t in the vessel one-quarter of a LOG other than it comes from the remnants of purity. But for both of his hands, even though they come from the remnants of purity, they are not effective until he pours twice. The first [rinsing] until the joint/wrist and the second time up until the joint/wrist. But Maimonides explains: from one pouring is from one rinsing [of water on his hands]. But when he pours both of his hands with one rinsing, the waters become defiled on his one hand, and it is found hat he washes the second with water that became defiled, and his hands were not purified until he poured a second [rinsing] of water from one-quarter of a LOG. But when he pours [water] on only one hand, through that rinsing, his hand is purified, but when he pours water a second time to purify the water that is on his hand, it is sufficient with less than one-quarter of a LOG. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Meir.
נפל ככר של תרומה – where he poured the first waters from one-quarter of a LOG [of a single rinsing] and a loaf of heave-offering/Terumah fell up upon them, or a loaf of heave-offering came in contact with the waters that were on his hand prior to his drying them, or prior to his pouring upon them a second time [for consuming heave-offering].
טהור – for just as they are effective to purify his hands, they are also effective to purify themselves.
ר' יוסי מטמא – for he holds that they are effective to purify his hands, but they themselves are impure.

Mishnah 2

נטל את הראשונים למקום אחד – that he pour the waters for the first [rising of the hands] with less than one-quarter of a LOG , as for example that they came from remnants of purity and he needs to pour the second [rinsing[. Or he poured the first [rinsing] in this corner and the second [rinsing] in another corner.
ונפל ככר של תרומה – in the place where the first waters fell.
טמא – the loaf [of heave-offering is impure]. And the same law applies if the loaf [of heave-offering] came in contact/touched the first waters that are upon his hands that the loaf is impure.
על השניים טהור – for the second [rinsing] are pure. But if he poured the first [rinsing] and the second [rinsing] in one place and a loaf of heave-offering fell on the water, it is impure, as it is taught in the concluding clause [of the Mishnah], that the second [rinsing] does not purify anything other than the water that is on his hand, meaning to say the first [rinsing] that is on his hands, the second [rinsing] purifies, but the firs [rinsing] that fell to the ground, the second [rinsing] does not purify.
ונמצא על ידיו קיסם או צרור – even though that they are loose and do not form a partition [between the body and the water so as to make immersion ineffective], when the water comes upon them.
ידיו טמאים – even though he placed upon them the second [rinsing], because the water that is on the pebgle became defiled on account of his hand, and the second [rinsing] of the water do not purify anything other than the water that is upon his hand, but not the water that is upon the pebble or the splinter/chip. Another explanation: “and there is found on his hands a chip or a pebble, and everything that interposes/forms a partition in the pouring water on the hands, even though he placed a second [rinsing] on his hands, the hands are ritually impure, and he did not purify it on account of the second [rinsing] of water, for the second [rinsing] of water does not purify other than the water that is upon the hand, gut not the hands themselves.
כל שהוא מבריית המים טהור (whatever originates in water is clean) -as for example gnats and mosquitos that grow in the water, if they fell upon the hands at the time of pouring [of water for ritual washing], they do not interpose, for since they originate in the water. But the Halakha is not according to Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel.

Mishnah 3

חזרו ליד טהורה - for since the first [rinsing of the hands] did not go past the wrist, the second [rinsing of the hands] were not defiled through their going out beyond the rest But when the first [rinsing of the hands] and the second [rinsing of the hands] went out beyond the wrist and returned to the hand, it is defiled, because the second [rinsing of the hands] with the first that went beyond the wrist, for the second [rinsing of the hands] does not purify the first [that go forth] beyond the wrist, but rather only until the wrist alone they purify.
נטל את הראשונים לידו אחת – that he poured the first [rinsing of the hands] on each individual hand separately, and afterwards combined the two hands to pour upon them the second [rinsing of the hands], his hands are impure. For when he combined his hands, his hands wee defiled through their contact/touching one another, for eh water that was on this one defiles the water that was on top of its fellow [hand], like that they defiled a loaf of heave-offerings, and the hands were defiled on account of the impure liquids. But when he poured the second [rinsing of the hands], they did not purify the first [rinsing of the hands], because they were defiled on account of the waters of its partner, but on the contrary also the second [rinsing of the hands] were defiled by them. And especially when he poured the first [rinsing of the hands] this one (i.e., one hand) for itself and that one (i.e., the other hand) for itself, but if he poured the first [rinsing of the hands] for the two hands as one, the two hands are considered as one hand and hey don’t defile one another. Such is what I found as an explanation of this Mishnah in the explanations/commentaries of my Rabbis/Teachers. But Maimonides explained, that if he poured the first [rinsing of the hands] on only one hand alone, and afterwards combined both hands to pour upon them the second [rinsing of the hands], his hands are impure, for the second [rinsing of the hands] are defiled by the hand that was not purified, and they return and defile the pure hand.
ושפשפה בחברתה (and rubbed his other hand) – that he had not poured [water upon to ritually cleanse], the water that was on it was defiled on account of the other hand that had not been poured upon, and they return and defile the hand that he poured [water upon].
בראשו או בכותל – if he rubbed it on his head or on a wall in order to dry it.
טהורה – but if after he rubbed it he returned and touched the same water that had come from his hand to his head or to the wall, it is defiled.. For those waters are defiled and they return and defile the hand that touched them. Even though that all the while that he did not rub, they are [purified/ as we need to say] with the rubbing, for when he rubbed and went back and touched, he made it worse.
נוטלים ארבעה וחמשה זה בצד זה – and we don’t worry because of four things, because lest they were defiled that they (i.e., the water) fell from one hand to the other, or lest they have the law of water that work had been done with them, or because lest they didn’t pour from a vessel, or because perhaps they didn’t pour from one-quarter of a LOG.
ובלבד שירפו (that they lie loosely) – that their hands [would lie loosely] so that there wouldn’t be an interposition/an intervening object there.

Mishnah 4

ספק נעשה בהן מלאכה – for work defiles the water for pouring, as is taught in the first chapter [of Tractate Yadayim, see Mishnah 3].
טמאים – invalid for pouring [water for ritual cleansing of the hands].
ספיקו טהור – even if there is with the water that he poured [for the ritual cleansing of the hands] so many of these doubts. And is the doubt of its being purified as the Rabbis and Rabbi Yossi argue in the concluding clause [of the Mishnah]. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Yossi.
ספק ידים ליטמא ולטמא – (see Tractate Taharot, Chapter 4, Mishnah 7 as this Mishnah explains the general principle learned there) further on in the other segment [of the Mishnah] it explains it].
שני ככרים טמאים - that impure foods defile the hands, as it is taught in the Mishnah [of Tractate Yadayim] in Chapter 3 [Mishnah 2]: “Whatever imparts unfitness to heave-offering imparts uncleanness to the hands to become second-degree of ritual uncleanness.”
שני ככרים טהורים – we are speaking of Terumah/heave-offering, that the hands invalidate the heave-offering.
הידים כמו שהיו והככרים כמות שהיו – that which is defiled in its defilement and that which is pure in its purity.

Chapter 3



Mishnah 1

המכניס ידיו לבית המנוגע ידיו תחילות (a person who pokes his hands into a leprous house -his hands are first degree of uncleanness) – it invalidates first degree in non-sacred matters, for something that is first-degree of uncleanness makes something second-degree of uncleanness in non-sacred things. And defiles first degree and invalidates first degree of uncleanness with heave-offering/Terumah. And it defiles two things and invalidates one in holy things.
כל המטמא בגדים בשעת מגעו – as for example the flux of a person with gonorrhea and his spittle, and all of these are taught in the last chapter [Five] of [Tractate] Zavim [Mishnah 7] that a person who comes in contact with them defiles clothing at the time of his contact (see Mishnah 1 of that chapter).
וכי היאך אשפר להן להיות תחילה – for it is not worthy to become first degree of uncleanness other than if that person came in contact with a primary source of ritual uncleanness. But if his hands came in contact with a primary source of ritual uncleanness, all of his body is defiled. Therefore, it is not in my hands to find the hands as a first-degree of ritual uncleanness, other than one pokes his hands into a leprous house, for if he poked his hands, he was not defied entirely, but if he defiles his clothing at the time of his contact, even though he is considered a primary source of ritual uncleanness to defile clothing and make something first-degree and second-degree of ritual uncleanness, he is not considered a primary source of uncleanness to defile a person, but he defiles the hands that came in contact with it to be first-degree of ritual uncleanness. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Akiva.
את שנטמא באב הטומאה – that is to say, food and utensils/vessels that were defiled by a primary source of ritual uncleanness.
מטמאין את הידים – but not food nor utensils/vessels that were defiled by liquids, for something that is second-degree ritual uncleanness does not make something second-degree ritual uncleanness. And the Halakha is according to the Sages.
במה היתה הטומאה – of the oven, through a primary source of ritual uncleanness or through a liquid.

Mishnah 2

כל הפוסל את התרומה – that is second degree ritual impurity (i.e., food that became ritually impure through contact with first degree ritual impurity. It renders Terumah/heave-offering with third degree ritual impurity. The Sages decreed that sacred books/scrolls and unwashed hands have second degree ritual impurity status).
מטמאה את חברתה – Whomever had one hand impure and it came in contact with his other pure hand, it becomes defiled, and both of them returned ritually impure.
והלא כתבי הקודש – that they (i.e., the Rabbis) decreed that they (i.e., sacred books/scrolls) are second degree ritual impurity and they invalidate the heave-offering/Terumah (i.e., priest’s due), and they defile the hands that come in contact with them to be second [degree ritually impure], so we see that something second degree ritually impure makes [something else] second [degree ritually impure].
ולא דברי סופרים מדברי סופרים – but the defilement of the hands of all of the defilements, is from the words of the Scribes (i.e., Rabbinic law – generally from the period of Ezra), for Shlomo (i.e., King Solomon) established [the laws of] Eruvin/Sabbath limits and hands [which are not found in the Written Torah]. And Holy Writ that defiles the hands is also from the words of the Scribes, which is from the eighteen matters (i.e., actually decrees) that they made on that day (i.e., when Rabban Gamaliel was deposed: see Talmud Berakhot 28a). But we do not judge/make a ruling from this case to that one to state that just as we found that Holy Scrolls that are second [degree of ritual impurity] make [something else] second [degree of ritual impurity], so here also in the remainder of the defilements that will be that something second [degree ritual impurity] will make [something else] second [degree ritual impurity, for what was established was established was established [and] what was not established was not established. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Yehoshua.

Mishnah 3

רצועות של תפילין מטמאות את הידים – that when they (i.e., the Rabbis) made the decree on [the defiling of] the hands that comes on account of a scroll that invalidates the heaven offering, they decreed also on the hands that came in contact with the straps of the Tefillin/phylacteries.
ר' שמעון אומר כו' – But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Shimon.

Mishnah 4

שמלמעלן ושמלמטן (the upper and lower margins) - that he (i.e., the Scribe) needs to leave free without writing above from the column [in the parchment] three fingerbreadths and one handbreadth below.
שבתחילה ושבסוף – at the beginning of the Scroll he needs to leave free in order to roll all of the Scroll, meaning to say, like the measurement of the circumference of the entire Scroll, that the Scroll, when t is rolled from its end to its beginning is similar to a Mezuzah when they fold it from [the word] אחד/[“God is] one,” directed towards the שמע/[first word of the] Shema. And at its conclusion in order to roll up the scroll of the Law around a cylinder (i.e., a handle). And especially when he doesn’t have anything there other than the Torah alone, he needs to do this, but when he fastens the [text of the] Torah, [the text of] the Prophets and [the text of] the Writings together, he needs to roll up the all of the Scroll at its end, in order to roll the cylinder at its beginning. But if he rolls it towards its beginning, it is found that the Torah (i.e., Five Books of Moses) is from the outside, and it is disgraceful that that Torah should be made into a guardian for the Prophets and the Writings. And it is this that we are speaking f in the first chapter of Bava Batra [13b-14a] and he makes it in order to roll [enough blank parchment wrapped around a cylinder from its beginning and in order that there be a circumference of the Scroll at its end.

Mishnah 5

כפרשת ויהי בנוסע הארון – because since that portion (Numbers 10:35-36) is considered like a Scroll (i.e., book of the Torah) by itself. And similarly, they stated in the Midrash Yelamdenu [regarding] (Proverbs 9:1): “[Wisdom has built her house,] She has shewn her seven pillars,” these are seven Scrolls of the Torah, since the book [of] “And God spoke” (i.e., referring to the Book of Numbers) was divided into three parts, and [there are] four other books (i.e., Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus and Deuteronomy), hence there are seven [books of the Torah]. (see Talmud Shabbat 116a and especially the first Tosafot that explains this Midrash on how the Israelites left Mount Sinai in a desire to discard their learning.)
מגילה שכתוב בה – that is to say a writing sheet [which contains several columns] of a Torah scroll, since eighty five letters were written in it, it became sanctified and defiles the hands.
Kohelet does not render the hands impure. This is because its wisdom is [King] Solomon's, and was not said through divine revelation:
כדברי בן עזאי כך נחלקו וכך גמרו – and this is the Halakha.

Chapter 4



Mishnah 1

בו ביום – This refers to the chapter above regarding the words of Rabbi Shimon ben Azzai, that speaks of the day when they appointed Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah in the Academy [as the Nasi/president]. And every place where it states, "בו ביום" /on that day, in the Mishnah, it is regarding that day which is spoken of.
נמנו (they were counted – i.e., the votes were taken [and they decided]) – they stood for the count, to whom the number of those defile and the number of those who purify, and they decided the law according to the majority.
עריבת הרגלים – tub made for washing the feet.
שנסדקה –[which was cracked] near its bottom, and it doesn’t hold water in order to wash his one foot.
טמאה מדרס – for a tub made for a foot-bath prior its becoming cracked also was customary to sit in it, and it served [as a place] to sit while working.
שר' עקיבא – he would dispute and saw that the tub for a foot-bath is like its name (i.e., for washing the feet only, and not for sitting), that is, that like its name, so it is, that there is no מדרס/Levitical uncleanness arising from someone with gonorrhea having immediate contact through treading or leaning upon it. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Akiva.

Mishnah 2

כל הזבחים שנזבחו שלא לשמן כשרים – this Mishnah is taught from the beginning of Tractate Zevakhim [Chapter 1, Mishnah 1] and there we have explained it.

Mishnah 3

עמון ומואב מה הן בשביעית – This is not Ammon and Moab that purified in Sihon which is in the inheritance of Reuben and Gad [in Transjordan], for this is the Land of Israel, even if you wish to state that those who came up from Babylonia [following seventy years of Exile in Babylonia following the Destruction of the First Temple] did not conquer it, perforce [the laws of] the Seventh Year are practiced in it, for it is taught in the Mishnah in the Tractate Sheviit, Chapter הפיגם/The Herb rue (i.e., Chapter 9) [Mishnah 2]: “There are three lands/regions [are delineated] with respect to [the laws] of removal: Judea, Transjordan and the Galilee.” And Transjordan is the land of Sihon. But we are speaking about the remainder of the land of Ammon and Moab where they didn’t purify in Sihon nor ever conquered it. Know, that when they include [a person] who made Aliyah [to the Land of Israel] from Babylonia and from Egypt.
ולא שניתי מסדר השנים (I have not changed the order of the years) – of the world. After the year of [bringing] the Poor Man’s Tithe (i.e., year six of the cycle), we bring the Second Tithe [which is consumed in Jerusalem]. Therefore, it is appropriate in the Seventh Year [to bring] Second Tithe
המעשר והתרומה – perforce, the Tithe that is mentioned here is Second Tithe, similar to Terumah/heave-offering which is holy, and not the Poor Man’s Tithe which is profane/non-consecrated, and one cannot make Second Tithe inoperative because of the poor.
כמשיב על דברי ר' טרפון – to assist him.
אבל לא לענין דבריו – meaning to say, but not from his reasoning.
מצרים מעשה חדש – that the elders that existed after Ezra establish to separate tithes in Egypt.
ובבבל מעשה ישן – it is the ordinance of the Prophets who existed prior to the Destruction of the Temple, but the matter was forgotten, for perhaps there wasn’t a need for the poor at that particular hour/time.
עשה נביאים – and by the word of Prophecy, they made a special emergency dispensation (not to be taken as a precedent), and we don’t learn from it.
הלכה למשה מסיני – Not exactly. For this is not from Torah, but rather, it is as if it is a usage dating from Moses as delivered from Sinai (i.e., a traditional interpretation of a written law). However, in the Tosefta [Tractate Yadayim, Chapter 2, Halakha 16 – in the Zuckermandel edition], it implies it is stating an actual usage dating from Moses as delivered from Sinai.

Mishnah 4

שנאמר ואסיר גבולות עמים (“I have erased the borders of peoples; I have plundered their treasures, And exiled their vast populations”) – that he (i.e., the Assyrians) would banish the people of this city and settle them in a different city, and he would banish the people of a different city and settle them in this city.
ושבתי את שבות עמי ישראל ועדיין לא שבו – just as they (i.e., the children of Israel) did not return, so also, they (i.e., the people of Ammon) did not return.
והתירו לבוא בקהל – for since that [members] from the seventy nations [of the known world] it is not forbidden for them to join/enter into the [Israelite] community other than the Ammonite and Moabite for all time, and an Egyptian and an Edomite for the first and second generations [it is forbidden for them to enter the Israelite community] (see Deuteronomy 23:8-9), here where these nations are not known for they (i.e., Ammonites and Moabites) have already been mixed up and combined among the rest of the other nations, we state: “he who separates [himself] - separates from a majority,” and all who convert are permitted to enter the [Israelite] community.

Mishnah 5

תרגום שכתבו עברית – The Aramaic interpretation/version that are in [the books of] Daniel and Ezra and [passages such as] (Jeremiah 10:11): “Thus you shall say to them: [Let the gods, who did not make heaven and earth, perish from the earth and from under these heavens],” if they wrote it in the Holy Tongue (i.e., Hebrew), and similarly, the words of the Prophet that are stated in the Holy Tongue that are written in Aramaic interpretation/version, do not defile the hands.
כתב עברי – the writing that comes from the other side of the river (i.e., Euphrates in Babylonia). But the Cutheans (i.e., Samaritans) write this way until today, but the Israelites would use the same script in their secular words. And on the coins that are found in our hands today that were from the time of the Kings of Israel, they are engraved with this same script. But the script that we write Scrolls with today, it is called the Assyrian script (i.e., the modern form of Hebrew type – which was brought along by the returning Babylonian captives, and made to supersede the older Syriac or Samaritan letters), and it is the script that was on the Tablets [of the Law – i.e., the Ten Commandments]. And it is called Ashuri/Assyrian, which is the most substantial of the scripts (see also Sanhedrin 22a), it is the language of (Genesis 30:13): “Women will deem me fortunate. [So she named him Asher].”

Mishnah 6

אומרין צדוקין – those who contradict the Oral Torah are called Sadducees, on account of Tzadok and Baitus, students of Antigonos the man of Sokho (see Tractate Avot, Chapter 1, Mishnah 3 and Avot D’Rabbi Nathan, Chapter 5) that they began this disgrace/corruption initially. Because they heard from Antigonos the man of Sokho their Rabbi/Teacher, “Do not be like servants who serve the master in order to receive a reward.” They said, is it possible for a worker who goes to the trouble and engages in work all day long and in the evening, he doesn’t receive a reward? And they interpreted from the words of the Sages, and many sects from Israel joined with them, and until this day, there remains remnants of them in Egypt, in Damascus and in Constantine, and they are like sore in our eyes and a thorn in our sides, and we call them Karaites, because they don’t have anything other than the Bible alone.
קובלין אנו עליכם – we are discontented/disturbed by your qualities.
פרושים – to the Sages of Israel, they would call Pharisees, because they consume their non-sacred [foods] in ritual purity and separate themselves from contact with the commoners [who are not punctilious in their observance of tithing and Levitical uncleanness], as is taught in the Mishnah (Tractate Hagigah, Chapter 2, Mishnah 7): “The clothing of commoners is in the status of treading/Levitical uncleanness arising from a man who has gonorrhea having immediate contact by treading/leaning against.”
תרוודות (spoon – pointed on top and curved at the end) – spoons that we eat with them. In the language of (see Tractate Nazir, Chapter 7, Mishnah 2 -49b): “a tarvad-full of dust.”
אף ספרי הקודש לפי חיבתן היא טומאתן (according to their preciousness is their uncleanness) – that a person should not use them as a mat/cover for beasts. But according to their words, he would respond to the, and not according to the truth. For the reason that the Holy Books defile the hands, is in order that they should not bring the books/scrolls to loss, for the mice that are found near those who eat would ruin the Scrolls, as we explain at the conclusion of [Tractate] Zavim (see the Bartenura commentary to Mishnah 12 of the fifth chapter of the tractate concerning Terumah/heave-offering).

Mishnah 7

אמת המים הבאה מן הקברות – the Sadducees admit regarding this that it is pure, as it is written (Leviticus 11:36): “[However, a spring or cistern] in which water is collected shall be pure.”
שהרי אין בהם דעת – that they will intend to cause financial loss to their owners.

וכשלקה – [when] Pharaoh [was smitten].
מה הוא אומר ה' הצדיק – in order not to complete the Tractate with [the words], “Who is the LORD that I should heed him,” because you do not remain/endure with a negative matter, it (i.e., the Tractate] concludes with (Exodus 9:27): “The LORD is in the right [and I am my people are in the wrong].”
