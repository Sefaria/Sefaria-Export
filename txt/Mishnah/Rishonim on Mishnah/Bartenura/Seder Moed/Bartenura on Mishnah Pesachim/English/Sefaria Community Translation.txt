<b>The meat became impure but the forbidden fats remains [pure], one may not sprinkle [its] blood [on the alter]</b> since the reason for the coming of the paschal sacrifice is for eating.
<b>And it is not like this with [other] offerings</b> that even if the meat becomes impure and the forbidden fats remain [pure], [its] blood is sprinkled.

<b>A limb</b> from the Paschal sacrifice.
<b>Part of [a limb] left</b> [the group's] boundaries, and it is necessary to chop the portion that exited; as it says (Exodus 22) "And meat that was torn (died without slaughter) in the field you should not eat," this is explained to refer to any flesh that was left out in the field i.e. it left it's boundaries; Like holy of holies that went beyond the courtyard or lesser holies that exited Jerusalem: that meat that left is considered "torn" and you should not eat it.
<b>Cut</b> the part of the meat that exited in a circle until the bone.
<b>And peel</b> the meat that didn't depart until it reaches the joint, and eat the peeled meat since it did not exit, and chop the joint and send off the entire bone of which part left the boundary.
<b>And with mukdashim:</b> other sacrifices sans the paschal sacrifice cleave the portion that exited (through the bone) with a cleaver. With the paschal sacrifice it is forbidden to do this, since it is prohibited from having a bone broken.
<b>He cut it with a hatchet:</b> The same part of the limb that came out. And on Passover, he cannot do so because he is warned about breaking a bone.
<b>From the door-wing and inside:</b> A door-wing is any place where the door closes i.e. the place that the door overlaps and taps when it is closed. (This is the inner lip of thick portion of the door until the spot of closure. From the wing inwards.) This is entirely inside the city.
<b>As inside:</b> and eat there the lesser holies.
<b>From the door-wing and towards the outside</b>: This is from the point of closure outwards, it is considered outside.
<b>The windows</b> that are in the walls of Jerusalem. And the thickness of the top of the wall in the roof, is considered like the inside.

ON HE WHO ARRIVES IN JERUSALEM FIRST - To encourage them, that they will all try to be first. All children will be on the paschal offering but he who comes first merits first and everyone else does so after him, due to him.
