Bartenura on Mishnah Shabbat



Chapter 1



Mishnah 1

יציאות השבת – transferring an object from one domain to [another] domain (i.e., removing taking out of the house – see Talmud Shabbat 2b) that are mentioned concerning the Sabbath and carrying in are also called transferring since one takes out from one domain to another domain. And the fact that [the Mishnah] teaches יציאות /carrying (on the Sabbath) and it does not teach הוצאות /transferring, is because it uses the language of the Bible, as it is written (Exodus 16:29): “Let no one leave his place [on the seventh day],” and from it, we derive transferring, that a person should not leave with a utensil in his hand to collect the Manna.
שתים שהן ארבע – two from the Torah, transferring an object and carrying [it] in to the house owner who stands inside in the private domain, and on these two, a person is liable for a sin-offering for his inadvertent violation, and divine punishment by premature/sudden death for a willful violation, and stoning for his being warned, like in all the rest of the prohibited labors of Shabbat.
שהן ארבע – from their words (i.e., the Rabbis), they added two, to prohibit ab initio a case where the work is done by two people – this one uprooting and this place setting it down, for two who did it are exempt, as it states (Leviticus 4:27): “by doing any of the things which by the LORD’s commandments ought not to be done, [and he realizes his guilt].” The one who does all of it, but not the one who does part of it, and similarly, in all the labors of Shabbat we say that an individual who did it is liable; two who did it are exempt.
שתים שהן ארבע בחוץ – two from the Torah, taking out and carrying in for the poor person who stands outside in the public domain.
שהן ארבע – from their words (i.e., the Rabbis), they added two to prohibit ab initio, as this person uproots it and the other person sets it down.
פשט העני את ידו – and in it is a box or a basket that he receives in it loaves of bread from the owner of the house, and for this reason, [the Mishnah] took hold of the language of הוצאה /removal in the language of the poor person and the rich person, for it incidentally comes to teach us that a commandment that comes through a transgression is prohibited and they are liable upon it.
ונתן לתוך ידו של בעל הבית – that he performs uprooting from the public domain and placement in the private domain.
או שנטל מתוכה והוציא – the object, and placed it in the public domain, and performed uprooting and placing down.
העני חייב – as he did complete work, for it is two from the Torah for the person standing outside, and even though we require uprooting from the place where he will be four handbreadths by four handbreadths and setting down in a place where he will be four-by-four [handbreadths] and there isn’t found there [that amount] for the hand of the poor person and the owner of the house, there isn’t there a place where there will be four-by-four [handbreadths] , we say in the Gemara (Talmud Shabbat 5a) that the hand of a person is considered as four-by-four [handbreadths], since it is made to place it down and to take from it objects and even many large ones.
ובעל הבית פטור – he (i.e., the owner of the house) is exempt and it is completely permitted, for he had not done anything.
פשט בעל הבית כו' בעל הבית חייב – for this is two from the Torah for the person who stands inside.
פשט העני כו' – for the poor person made an uprooting from the public domain.
ונטל בעל הבית מתוכה – and placed it inside, for the owner of the house did a placing down [of the object] in the private domain.

והוציא – the poor person [removed it] and placed it down in the public domain.
שניהם פטורים – for neither of them had done a complete [cycle] of work/labor. But it is prohibited to do this lest everyone come on his own to do a complete [cycle of] work on the Sabbath day. There are two [forms of work] “from their words” (i.e., from the Rabbis), one for the poor person outside and one for the owner of the house inside. But it is not considered two for each one of them, uprooting for the poor person and uprooting for owner of the house, placing down for the poor person and placing down for the owner of the house, because it is not considered other than uprooting [of things] which are the beginning of the work and there is a fear lest he complete it, but placing down, which is the end of the work, is not considered.

Mishnah 2

לא ישב אדם לפני הספר – and even on weekdays, and since it (i.e., the Mishnah) had to teach (in Tractate Shabbat, Chapter 1, Mishnah 3) that a tailor must not go out with his needle, etc., lest he forget and leave, which is similar to the decree that a person should not sit before the barber close to [the time] for the afternoon prayer, lest he forget and not pray, because of this, it [the Mishnah] teaches this here, and since their words are small/short, he makes a decision and teaches it in the first part of the Mishnah, and then explains the matters of Shabbat and expands upon them.
סמוך למנחה – the “Great Minha”, from six-and-one-half [Halakhic] hours and beyond, and סמוך למנחה – close to the afternoon prayer , that is from the beginning of the seventh hour, and even though its time period is great, a decree was made lest the bell/body of the bell of the barbers breaks after he began to cut the hair, and the time of the prayer will pass over prior to his repairing it and he will complete the haircut.
ולא יכנס למרחץ – near the time for the afternoon prayer lest his swoon [in the vapor bath – see Tractate Shabbat 9b].
ולא לבורסקי – a place where hides are made, perhaps he would see a loss and ruin of the hides if he did not move them from their place and repair them, and he would continue in his work until the time for the [Minha/afternoon] prayer had passed.
ולא לאכול – even a small repast, lest the meal continue on.
ולא לדין – even at the close of legal proceedings, when they already had heard the claims of the litigants and there does not remain anything upon them other than only to decide the law, perhaps they see a reason and they will contradict what they want to decide and return to be the beginning of judgment.
ואם התחילו – in one of all of these, we state, that we don’t interrupt, but rather he should finish and afterwards prayer, and this is the case when there is a delay during the day to complete it prior to the time for prayer passing. But the beginning of a haircut is from when he places the apron/garment for the protection of the clothing of the barber between his knees, and this is the scarf that the person who has his hair cut upon his knees in order that the hair doesn’t fall on his clothing. And the beginning of the bath is from when he removes/undresses the clothing that is closest to his skin. And there are those who explain that the scarf that is upon him which is the first to be removed when he gets undressed. And the beginning of the tannery is when he girds himself between his shoulders the coverings of his arms in order to engage with the hides, and the beginning of eating is when he washes his hands. The beginning of judgment is when the judges cover themselves with their shawls to sit in judgment with terror and fear, and if they were covered and sitting in judgment and another case came before them near the time for Minhah, it would be the beginning of that case when the litigants would open with their pleas/claims.
מפסיקין לק"ש – he took another matter, and this is how it should be read: colleagues engaged in the study of Torah interrupt their Torah study for the recitation of the Shema for its time is fixed, as it is written (Deuteronomy 6:9): “when you lie down and when you rise up.”
ואין מפסיקין לתפילה – which has no fixed time according to the Torah. But we are not teaching other than in the case of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his colleagues where their study of Torah is their craft, but for us, since we interrupt our Torah [study] for our craft/professions, all the more so we interrupt for our recitation of the Amidah.

Mishnah 3

לא יצא חייט במחטו – even if it is inserted in his clothing, lest he forget and go out, and for an artisan, it is the manner of his craft, he liable for it is way of artisans to insert them in their clothing when they go out to the market.
שמא ישכח ויצא – when it gets dark.
הלבלר – the scribe.
בקולמוסו – which is inserted at the back of their ears like the manner of scribes.
ולא יפלה את כליו – to remove vermin from his clothing. The Aramaic translation/Targum of “I have cleared out the consecrated portion” (Deuteronomy 26:13) “I searched my garment for vermin.”
ולא יקרא לאור הנר – in a book, lest he tilt the candle to bring the oil in front of the lick in order that it will kindle well and is found that he is starting a fire on Shabbat, and even if the candle was the height of two or three men, it is always forbidden to read by the light of a candle unless there is another person with him to watch him, or if he is an important individual who is never accustomed to fix the candle.
החזן – one who teaches young children.
מהיכן התינוקות קורין – from where should they begin to read, for with a bit of investigation such as this, we do not make a decree lest he tilt it, and the young children read before their teacher by the light of the candle since their fear of their teacher is upon them.
אבל הוא לא יקרא – the entire portion, because his fear of them is not upon him, and their guarding is not considered guarding, and for this reason also, there is an opinion that a woman who guards for her husband, her guarding is not [considered] guarding, for fear of her is not upon him.
כיוצא בו – to make a distance from transgression, they said that a person with a flux should not eat with his wife who has a flux, and even though both of them are ritually impure.
מפני הרגל עבירה – for since they engaged in sexual intercourse, he will go to engage in sex with a woman with a flux which is punishable by extirpation, and the man with a flux and a woman with a flux are taken as something remarkable, for sexual relations is hard for them, and it is possible to say that they definitely will not lead to transgression, and even so, they should not eat one with the other.

Mishnah 4

ואלו מן ההלכות – the don’t remove vermin nor read by the light of a candle as it is taught in our Mishnah (Tractate Shabbat, Chapter One, Mishnah Three).
בעליית חנניה בן חזקיה – that the Sages requested to hide the [biblical] Book of Ezekiel since his words seem to contradict the words of the Torah, such as {Ezekiel 44:31): “Priests shall not eat anything, whether bird or animal, that died or was torn by beasts,” priests are those who should not eat it, but Israelites [can] eat it (which obviously, are also forbidden to all Israelites), and similarly (Ezekiel 45:20): “You shall do the same on the seventh day of the month [to purge the Temple from uncleanness caused by unwitting or ignorant persons],” for where is this sacrifice hinted at in the Torah? Hananiah ben Chizkiah hid himself in the attic and sat there and explained the Book of Ezekiel.
ושמונה עשר דברים גזרו בו ביום – that the School of Shammai and the School of Hillel disputed on and were decided by a vote and the [opinions of] School of Shammai grew and they (i.e., the Rabbis) decided [the Halakha] according to them, as it is written (Exodus 23:2): “[You shall neither side with the mighty to do wrong- you shall not give perverse testimony in a dispute so as] to pervert it in favor of the mighty/multitude.” And all eighteen things they brought to them in the Talmud (Tractate Shabbat 13b-17b), and these are as follows: 1-2) He who eats something which is first degree of ritual impurity or second degree of ritual impurity, they decreed that its essence becomes second degree of ritual impurity, and it defiles Terumah/priest’s due by contact, for something that is second degree of ritual impurity defiles Terumah, these are two decrees – the person who eats something which is first degree of ritual impurity or one who eats something that is second degree of ritual impurity. 3) a person who drinks impure liquids also becomes second degree of ritual defilement, and defiles Terumah, that is third. But the reason that it is decreed in these, is that sometimes, when one eats impure foods and sprinkles/pours impure liquids in his face while the impure foods are in his mouth and he defiles them. 4) And they made a decree on a person after immersing from his defilement on that same day who had drawn water come upon his head and most of his body and 5) on the completely pure person upon fell three LOGS (i.e., a LOG is equivalent to six eggs) of drawn water on his body, that is five decrees. And the reason that defilement was decreed on these to defile others, is because they would immerse in putrid (i.e., badly smelling) cave waters, and they would place upon them afterwards drawn waters to remove the putridness of the waters, they began and made a fixed ruling to state, that the cave waters did not purify but rather the drawn waters purify, and they (i.e., the Rabbis) stood and decreed defilement upon them, lest they come to nullify the teachings/laws of the Mikveh and they would immerse in drawn waters. 6) The sixth decree is that Books of Holy Writ defile Terumah through contact, for at first, they would hide the food of Terumah with Torah scrolls, people would say that this (i.e., the Torah scroll) and that (i.e., the Terumah) are holy, when they saw that the Books [of Holy Writ] were being damaged, since the mice that are found near the food-stuffs would cause damage to the Books [of Holy Writ], they decreed that these Books, that is, Torah, Prophets and Writings, through their contact would defile the Terumah. 7) The seventh decree that they made concerns mere (i.e., undefined] hands defile the Terumah, because the hands are busy (i.e., they touch things automatically) and touch the flesh in the place of filth/defilement, and it is a reproach for the Terumah if filthy/offensive-smelling hands touched it and it would be detestable for those who eat it. 8) The eighth decree [concerns] foods that were defiled by liquids, as those liquids were defiled on account of hands that came in contact with them prior to ritual washing, they decreed on the liquids that they would the food-stuffs [of Terumah], for all things that disqualify the Terumah defile liquids to become first-degree of ritual impurity, a decree made because of liquids that come on account of a moving creature/unclean reptile, as we find concerning hem that they are first-level of ritual defilement according to the Torah, and this that [the Rabbis] decreed on the defilement of liquids to become first-degree of ritual impurity and it was not decreed regarding food-stuffs as a decree, because [food-stuffs] that come from a moving creature/unclean reptile, and that is the reason that the Rabbis were stringent with liquids because they are liable to receive uncleanness, for they don’t require fitness to become unclean (arising from contact with certain liquids) to bring them to receive defilement such as foods which require putting water on them to make them susceptible to receive defilement. 9) And the ninth (see Mishnah Zavim, Chapter Five, Mishnah Thirteen which summarizes much of these opening decrees) concerns utensils that were defiled by liquids that had been defiled by a reptile/moving creature, even though they are of first degree defilement according to the Torah, they cannot defile a person nor utensils, for a person and utensils only receive defilement from a primary source of ritual impurity, and not from liquids that had been defiled by a reptile/moving creature, which are first-level of ritual defilement, and the Rabbis decreed concerning them that the utensils would become ritually defiled, as a decree because of the liquid of a man or woman with a flux, which are their spittle and the urine which are a primary source of ritual impurity and according to the Torah, defile utensils. 10) The tenth decree is that the daughters of the Cutheans (i.e., members of a sect of the Samaritans) are considered as menstruating from their cradle (i.e., earliest childhood), that is to say, from the day that they were born, as a baby one-day old defiles through her period of menstruation, but the Cutheans lack this Midrash and when it pointed out, it is not explained to them, therefore, the Rabbis decreed this about them. 11) And the eleventh decree is that all movables bring the defilement into the beam of the handle of a plough, and this is the ox-goad of the cattle, and there is what has the circumference of a handbreadth, but it lacks the thickness of a handbreadth, and even though, from the Torah, the tent is not less than a handbreadth, the Rabbis decreed on all movables that have the circumference of a handbreadth that if its heads – one forms a tent over the dead person and one forms a head over the utensils, it brings to them the defilement of the tent, a decree was made on account of that of that whose beam is one-handbreadth that brings the defilement from the Torah. 12) And the twelfth decree [concerns] one who cuts grapes to press them in the vat for wine pressing, the liquid that comes out from them at the time of the cutting of the grapes makes them susceptible to receive ritual defilement, and even though it goes to waste and one doesn’t care about it, the decree is made lest he should cut grapes in pitch-lined vessels/baskets, for then it is not appropriate for the liquid coming out from them they do not go to waste, and are susceptible [to receive defilement] from the Torah. 13) The thirteenth decree – that Terumah that has grown of their seeds is considered Terumah, and even with a thing whose seed is gone, such as grain and pulse/peas, the degree was made because impure Terumah in the hands of Kohen which is forbidden to be eaten and he comes to sow it, and it was decreed that it would be with its first name – and that it Is ritually impure grain, for we suspect lest he leaves it until the time of sowing and comes to eat of it in impurity. 14) The fourteenth decree is that he who was overtaken by the Sabbath night fall should give his money to a heathen, and not carry it for less than four cubits. 15-16) And the fifteenth and sixteenth decrees, that he should not remove vermin nor read by the light of a candle as it is taught in our Mishnah (see Mishnah three of this chapter). 17) And the seventeenth decree that was made on the bread of idolaters, and on the oil and wine of and on their daughters, they are all one decree, as we have said – they decreed on their bread on account of their oil, and on their oil on account of their wine, and on their wine on account of their daughters, and on their daughters because of another thing, that is to say, because of idolatry. 18) And the eighteenth decree they made on the baby of an idolater that would defile through flux/gonorrhea, in order that a Jewish baby not become accustomed to be near him [out of a concern] for pederasty.

Mishnah 5

אין שורין דיו – dyes that they make for them ink for writing.
וסממנים – to dye.
וכרשינים – food for cattle, and it is customary to soak them in water first, and we call them in Arabic “Karsena” and in the foreign tongue “vetch.” And the School of Shammai holds that a person is careful concerning observing the Sabbath abstention from labor with his utensils like the abstention form labor on the Sabbath of his animal, and it is for the same reason that we don’t give him bundles of wet flax, and that is the reason that we don’t spread out nets for traps. But the candle that burns on Shabbat and the pot that is on top of the portable stove on feet (with caves for two pots) that the School of Shammai admits to, since [he has renounced] ownership for the utensils, he furthermore is not commanded concerning their abstention from labor on the Sabbath.
וב"ה מתירין – from when he placed water in them while it was still day (i.e., on Friday), even though they are continuing to soak on the Sabbath, as they (i.e., the School of Hillel) hold that a person is warned regarding the Sabbath rest of the animals because there is the suffering of animals connected with the case (which must be relieved).

Mishnah 6

אונין – bundles of beaten [wet] flax, and we put them in the oven and heated.
שיבהילו – when they are warmed, the steam would rise up on them
ליורה – of the dyers.
אלא כדי שיקלוט את העין – that it would absorb the color while it is still day (i.e., on Friday).
וב"ה מתירין – to put them into it while it still day so that it would absorb it all night long. But the School of Hillel did not permit other than with a dyer’s kettle uprooted from the fire, for if there is fire underneath it on Shabbat, it is prohibited, as a preventive decree lest he rake the coals underneath the ashes (Talmud Shabbat 18b and 34b). But he also needs that the kettle is sealed with plaster, as a preventive decree lest he stir it and turn it over on Shabbat (Talmud Shabbat 18b), and he would be liable because of [the prohibition against] cooking.

Mishnah 7

ולא טוענין עמו – on the donkey.
ולא מגביהין – on to it a burden on its shoulder, for it appears as if he is assisting it to carry the burden on the Sabbath.
אלא כדי שיגיע למקום קרוב – that is to say, that the place that he wants to carry it to is close that he would be able to arrive there while it is still day (i.e., on Friday).
וב"ה מתירין – in order that he leaves from the opening of his house while it is still daylight.

Mishnah 8

לעבדן – to prepare the hides.
מתירין עם השמש – while the sun is on the land prior to its setting.

Mishnah 9

כלי לבן – which is difficult to launder, it requires three days, and they are stringent upon themselves like the School of Shammai. But the Halakha is not according to Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel, but rather according to the School of Hillel that permits it with the sunlight.
ושוין – The School of Shammai and the School of Hillel, that they load the olives while it is still daylight on the beam of the building containing the tank [and all the implements for pressing olives], after they crush the olives, they load them on heaven beams and the liquid flows on its own throughout the Sabbath.
ועגולי הגת – these of the winepress are called weights (clay cylinders), in which there were thick planks made in a round mold, and in this the School of Shammai agrees with the School of Hillel, because if they were to work these on the Sabbath, there would be no liability of transgression, because they don’t place the beam on the olives until they first mill them with a millstone and similarly with grapes that they first tread on them with their feet, and without the beam the liquid would come forth on its own, but it would not come out well until now, therefore, it is not similar to threshing.

Mishnah 10

כדי שיצולו – like the food of Ben Drosai (who, according to Rashi, was a pirate; see Talmud Shabbat 20a, s.v. קן דרוסאי) and would cook his food one-third through, and as such, it would be eatable but further, there was no decree made lest he stir the coals.
חררה – a thick cake baked on coals
שיקרמו – at the beginning of its baking it forms a crust.
פניה – which was towards the atmosphere of the oven.
כדי שיקרום התחתון – which cleaves to the earthenware of the oven, which is baked first prior to the crust forming on its face towards the atmosphere of the oven, and with this it is sufficient. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Eliezer.

Mishnah 11

משלשלין את הפסוח – their ovens have their mouths above and they lower the roasted [Passover offering] into it, and for that reason, it [i.e., the Mishnah] teaches, משלשלין /they lower/let down.
עם חשיכה – and even though generally, we do not roast it, as we have stated, here it is permitted, for the members of the group are zealous and they remind each other [that today is Shabbat] and they don’t come to stir the coals.
ומאחיזין את האור – [they ignite with kindling wood] a bit, with the pile of wood of the House of the Hearth (see Mishnah Tamid, Chapter 1, Mishnah 12), and we don’t suspect lest the Kohanim will come to start a fire once it gets dark, since the Kohanim are zealous.
בית המוקד – a large chamber in the [Temple] courtyard where they would always start a fire with wood and the Kohanim would warm themselves there, since they walk barefoot on the alabaster floor.
ובגבולין – a person needs to start a fire with his wood while it is still daylight (i.e., on Friday), in order that it catches the majority of the wood, and that the flame will go up on its own and does not need thin chips underneath it to flame the fire.
אף בפחמים כל שהוא – just as in the fire of the House of the Hearth, we are lenient in the House of the Hearth for the Kohanim, similarly, in a fire of charcoals, we are lenient for all people, and there is no need for anything other than any quantity that catches fire, for it is not accustomed to be extinguished and it continues and no one comes to stir it. And the Halakha is according to Rabbi Yehuda for there is no one who disputes him.

Chapter 2



Mishnah 1

במה מדליקין – the Shabbat candle – from what does not make the wicks and oils to kindle [them].
לא בלכש – a kind of wool that is in cedar, whether he scraped the tree and it is called the wooly substance of cedar twigs [used for wicks].
בחוסן – flax which is not beaten.
בכלך – the refuse of silk.
בפתילת האידן – a kind of wool that is [in the willow-branch] between the peeling/husk and the wood.
בפתילת המדבר – the leaves of long grass that grow them and kindle them.
בירוקה שעל פני המים – a kind of wool that grows on the walls of the ship when it is delayed a long time in the water. Until here are the wicks that are forbidden; from here onwards are the oils that are forbidden.
לא בזפת ולא בשעוה – he should not give melted pitch or smelted wax in a candle in the place of oil and kindle it but to a sort of long wick which is made from wax is permitted.
ולא בשמן קיק – oil that comes out from seeds that are within the wool of the vine which is called “cotton.” And there are those who explain (Tractate Shabbat 21a) the oil of Jonah’s Ricinus tree (Kikayon), and it is a grass whose leaves are large and is called in Arabic “Kru’ah” and the oil that comes out from it is the thickest. And those wicks which the Sages stated that we don’t kindle with them, what is the reason? Because the flame nibbles at them (producing sputtering sparks), that is to say - that the flame does not enter into the wick [other than] from around it from the outside. And those wicks that the Sages we should not kindle with them because they are not drawn after the wick and because the candle is not kindled properly lest he tilt the oil onto the candle in which he would be found to be starting a fire. Alternatively, he should not set the candle down and leave. But we hold that the Shabbat candle is obligatory.
ולא בשמן שריפה – oil of Terumah/priest’s due that became defiled. And why do we call it defiled heave-offering deemed to be burned? For since it stands to be burned and is prohibited to be consumed. And we are dealing with a Jewish holy day that occurs on a Friday, for we kindle the candle while it is still daylight, we find that it burns impure oil from Terumah on the Jewish holy day and we hold that we may not kindle holy things on the Jewish holy day, as it is written (Exodus 12:10): “And any of it that is left until morning you shall burn in the fire.” And we explain this Biblical verse as such: And that which is left from it until the first morning until the second morning, stand and burn it for we don’t burn that which is left over on the Jewish holy days. And the same law applies for all other Holy things that require burning.
וחכמים אומרים אחד מבושל ואחד שאינו מבושל אין מדליקין בו – and the first teacher [of the Mishnah] also said and no it tallow – which implies all tallow/fat. But there is a dispute between the Sages and the first teacher [of the Mishnah] as one of them thought that it is permitted to kindle with cooked fat that is mixed with oil and the other forbids it even through a mixture with oil. But it is not clear to the Sages in the Talmud which of the two prohibits and which is the one that permits it, but the Halakha is according to the Sages.

Mishnah 2

אין מדליקין בשמן שריפה ביו"ט – the reason that the Mishnah above (i.e., Mishnah 1) – it is stated, what is the reason that the Mishnah states – and not with impure oil from Terumah, because we don’t kindle with impure oil from Terumah since we do not kindle Holy Things on Jewish holy days.
אין מדליקין בעטרן – refuse of pitch and its smell is extremely bad, but however, it is drawn after the wick more than pitch because it is soft. Therefore, were it not because of the holiness of the Sabbath, they would kindle with it.
שומשמין – such is its name in Arabic, and it is soft, sweet seed and in the Land of Israel there is a lot of it.
צנונות – oil that comes out from radish seed.
פקועות – a desert gourd.
נפט – it is a kind of pitch and white, and its smell is bad, but the Halakha is according to the Sages that we kindle with all of the oils except from those impure ones that are listed above in our Mishnah and except from the oil of balsamum and white naphtha, for each of these two oils flies and burns, and we are concerned lest he set it aside and leave. But there is another reason to prohibit balsamum oil, a decree lest he be in doubt of it because of its importance, and we hold that a person who puts oil in the candle is liable because of starting a fire and one who is doubt of it is liable because of extinguishing it.

Mishnah 3

כל היוצא מן העץ אין מדליקין בו – to make of it a wick.
אלא פשתן – which is called a tree, as it is written (Joshua 2:6): “[Now she had taken them up to the roof] and hidden them under some stalks of flax [which she had lying on the roof],” and nevertheless, we kindle with wicks that we make from this. But hemp and vine wool do not come from the tree, but they are kinds of seeds, therefore, we kindle from them. And flax also is a kind of seed and it is not necessary to include it, but because it is called a tree, as it written: “and hidden under some stalks of flax.”
אינו מטמא טומאת אהלים – if he made from them a tent and the dead person underneath it is like the rest of the house and does not require sprinkling and immersion, for the tent itself is not susceptible to becoming impure other than the utensils that are underneath it.
אלא פשתן – for the tent itself is impure, as it is written (Numbers 19:18): “and sprinkle on the tent” and we derive “tent,” “tent” from the Tabernacle, as it is written concerning it (Exodus 40:19): “He spread the tent over the Tabernacle,” but there was nothing in the tent of the Tabernacle that comes out from the wood other than flax as it written (Exodus 26:1): “[As for the Tabernacle,] make it of ten strips of cloth; make these of fine twisted linen.”
שקפלה – in the manner that the wicks are grown.
הבהבה – on the flame in order that it will be charred and kindle nicely and we are dealing with a cloth that has confined three fingers in length by three fingers in length.
טמאה היא – that is folded is not voided from being considered as cloth since it has not parched.
טהורה היא – that is folded is voided from being considered as cloth and it is as if it does not have three-by-three, and anything that is less than three-by-three is pure from being defiled either by plagues (i.e., suspected leprosy) and defilement through contact with the dead.
אין מדליקין בה – we are dealing with the case of a Jewish holy day that occurs on the Eve of the Sabbath (i.e., Friday) for the prohibition of Muktzeh/that which is not counted upon for use on the Sabbath or Holy Days (i.e., which is prohibited to be handled on these days) and we do not start a fire with shards of utensils that were broken on that day that were [considered as] “born” but we may start a fire with utensils that are appropriate to be carried which everyone has, the individual who is kindling [the fire] must kindle most of what comes out from the wick outside of the candle before he removes his hands. Therefore, the reason of Rabbi Eliezer who said that we don’t kindle it holds that something that is folded does not removed from the notion of a utensil for when I kindle it a bit, since there is three-by-three defined exactly, it is considered a utensil, for less than three-by-three is not a utensil, and when one kindles with one’s hands to complete the majority of what comes out from it, it is found that he is kindling a shard of a utensil that was broken on the Jewish holy day/Yom Tov, and when we say that one may kindle a fire with utensils, specifically it refers that one has not come in contact with it after it has become defective. But Rabbi Akiva states that we kindle with it as he holds that something folded is removed from the status of a utensil for when it is folded from the eve of the Jewish holy day/Yom Tov, it does not grow wicks on the Jewish holy day and hence we find that we don’t have ere shards of a utensil that was broken on the Jewish holy day, and therefore we kindle it. And the Halakha follows Rabbi Akiva.

Mishnah 4

שפופרת של ביצה – the upper hard shell that the egg is lying within.
בשביל שתהא מנטפת – drop by drop into the candle and the reason is a decree lest he be supplied from it and since he set it aside for the candle, he is liable because of [the prohibition] of extinguishing.

Mishnah 5

מפני עובדי כוכבים – such as the Persians who do not allow the lighting of a candle on the day of their festivals other than in their houses of idolatrous worship.
מפני לסטים – that they do not fear that there is there a person who will come upon him.
מפני רוח רעה – that comes down upon him and when he doesn’t see [it], it is pleasant for him. But Maimonides explains [the words] רוח רעה as a kind of the illnesses that come upon those with black bile that they cannot rest other than when they sit in the dark and when hiding their faces from people.
ואם בשביל החולה שיישן פטור – this illness is when there is danger involved for if one extinguishes a flame for a sick person who is not in danger, he is liable [for a sin-offering] for what reason this Tanna/teacher holds that labor that is not necessary for its own sake, one is liable for it; and similarly because of idolaters and because of robbers and because of an evil spirit where there is danger, but according to the law, where it teaches that it is permitted – but because it (i.e., the Mishnah) was required to teach at its conclusion that it is prohibited, the first part of the Mishnah taught that one is exempt.
כחס על הפתילה חייב – and even though he does not need it for the body of the extinguishing but rather for the needs of something else, that he should not kindle the wick or that he should not split the candle, he is liable for that is labor that is not necessary for its own sake, and one is liable for it.
פוטר בכולן חוץ מן הפתילה – for you do not have something extinguished that is needed for itself, but rather the extinguishing of coals and the extinguishing of the singeing of the wick that makes the extinguishing process to take hold of the fire rapidly when one wants to kindle it. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Yosi.
שהוא עושה פחם – that he intends to make it now with the extinguished – which is coals which will be singed to light well.

Mishnah 6

בשעת לידתן – at the time of danger which is designated for retribution.
ובחלה ובהדלקת הנר – since these are needs of the home and are found in the home and are dependent upon it.

Mishnah 7

צריך אדם לומר בתוך ביתו – and he needs to say them in a gentle way (Tractate Shabbat 34a) in order that he will accept it from him.
עם חשיכה – which is near darkness and there is yet time during the day to tithe or to make an Eruv but not a lot of time prior to darkness.
עשרתם – for the Sabbath meal, for even for an incidental meal of the Sabbath establishes for tithing.
ערבתם – the joining of borders and courtyards and for these two it belongs to mention them in the form of a question, lest they have already been made, but with a candle, it does not belong to mention “have you kindled the candle” for this is a matter that is apparent to the eye – either that I should light or that I should not light.
ספק חשיכה – from the beginning of the setting of the sun, all the time that one star alone appears, it is definitely daylight and all the while that two medium-sized stars appear, it is doubtfully dark and it is called twilight and we place upon it the stringencies of the daytime and the stringencies of the nighttime, and when three medium-sized stars appear, it is definitely dark for all matters.
אין מעשרין את הודאי – this is a valid preparation but because of rabbinic decrees designed to enhance the character of the Shabbat as a day of rest/Shevut, this Tanna/teacher holds that they made a decree designed to enhance the character of the Sabbath as a day of rest even at twilight.
ואין מטבילין את הכלים – to elevate them from their ritual impurity for it is like repairing a utensil which has the rabbinic decree designed to enhance the character of the Sabbath as a day of rest.
ואין מדליקין את הנרות - all the more so since it is a doubtful Biblical commandment and this, and you don’t have to mention that, is taught. But my teachers explained that one does not kindle the candles nor does one tell a heathen to kindle [them].
אבל מעשרין את הדמאי – and it is not similar to repairing for most ignoramuses/Amei HaAretz tithe.
ומערבין – for the joining of courtyards is a mere stringency but not the joining of Sabbath boundaries that have support from Biblical verses.
וטומנין את החמין – concerning something that does not add vapor, for if it were something that added vapor, even while it is still daylight, it is prohibited, and the reason is that we cover up hot foods at twilight with something that does not add vapor for they (i.e., the Sages) did not prohibit covering up hot foods on the Sabbath itself with something that does not add vapor as a decree lest one finds a pot that has cooled off and its growing hot in fire and it is found to be cooking on the Sabbath and at twilight, one cannot make a decree on this for mere pots at twilight boil and one cannot suspect lest it cooled off and became hot. Therefore, we cover hot foods at twilight even though we do not cover hot foods on the Sabbath.

Chapter 3



Mishnah 1

כירה – a place made on the ground open to two pots and fire passes underneath the two pots.
בגבבא – thin wood like straw that they gather/rake in from the field.
נותנים עליה תבשיל – from the eve of the Sabbath (i.e., Friday) to tarry there on Shabbat.

לא יתן – from the eve of the Sabbath in order to have it tarry there on Shabbat.
עד שיגרוף – the coals and remove them from the double oven.
או שיתן האפר – on top of the coals to cover them and cool them off and the reason for the decree is lest he rake the coals under the ashes (Talmud Shabbat 34b) to speed up its cooking. And specifically, for a cooked dish that was not completely cooked, or even if it was completely cooked, and it reduced in size and it is improved by it, for they decreed lest he rake but the a dish that was not properly cooked at all or was completely cooked and which is deteriorated by boiling down (Talmud Shabbat 37b), it is permissible to have it tarry on the double oven even though it was not raked and folded, we don’t fear lest he rake it since he has removed it from his mind and similarly, a dish that was cooked completely and he cast into it raw meat prior to Twilight, everything was made like a dish that had not been cooked at all for he had completely removed it from his mind.
בש"א – they put hot water on top of the double stove after he has raked it for it is not necessary to cook it and there is no need to decree lest he stir it/rake [the coals underneath the ashes].
אבל לא תבשיל – even though he had removed the ashes and coals from the stove for it is impossible to remove all of the ashes/coals until there no longer remains even one spark and one would come to stir the embers after he is pleased with the cooking.
בש"א נוטלים וכו' – even hot foods for we are permitted to have them tarry on top of the double stone that has been cleared of ashes and when he placed the ashes after he removed them, he doesn’t return them/put them back because it appears like cooking on the Sabbath.
וב"ה אומרים – whether hot or cooked, one can put them (i.e., the ashes) back after having removed them, but the School of Hillel did not permit returning them other than while they are still in his hand that he had not placed them on another thing, but after he placed them in the ground or on another thing, it is forbidden to return them, even according to the School of Hillel because it is like hiding something ab initio on Shabbat.

Mishnah 2

תנור – because it is narrow above and wide below, it absorbs its heat into it more than a double stove and even if he heated it with straw and rakings, we fear that he might rake the coals under the ashes, for he never removes it from his mind.
בין מגביו – for support near its walls.
כופח – it is made like a double stove but its length is like its width and is stove which only has room for one pot (Tractate Shabbat 38b), and the fire passes underneath it and its vapor is greater than that of the double stove for the double stove is open above for two pots and the brazier/small stove is not open other than for the measure of one pot and has less than the vapor of an oven.

Mishnah 3

אין נותנין – on the Sabbath.
ביצה בצד המיחם – a copper kettle in which they heat up water on top of the fire.
שתתגלגל – that it will roast a bit until it becomes roasted/rounded, that is to say, mixed.

לא יטמיננה בחול ובאבק דרכים – that were warmed by the power of the sun and in that, Rabbi Yosi did not permit, for he decreed that the sand are because of the hot ashes/embers for since both of them were through putting a dish in a warm place or under covers to keep it warm for the Sabbath (Talmud Shabbat 39a), they will come to say – what is the difference between hot ashes and sand. Alternatively, Rabbi Yosi decreed lest he move the ashes dust from its place lest the sand there will not be removed according to its need, and he will come to move the attached dust and that is a derivative of ploughing.

Mishnah 4

סלון – a pipe that conducts the water in it and this pipe/duct was sunk in the hot springs of Tiberias and warmed from the power of those warm waters, and when the cold waters were drawn into it, they are warmed by that pipe/duct that was warmed by the hot springs of Tiberias, and the Sages said that the waters that were drawn into it that pipe on Shabbat, there law is like the law of waters that were warmed on Shabbat – that it is forbidden to bathe in them even a small limb and it is forbidden even for drinking, but the waters that pass through them on a Jewish holy day/Yom Tov, their law is like the law of hot waters that were heated on Yom Tov – that is forbidden to bathe one’s entire body in them, but it is permitted to wash one’s face, hands and feet in them, but drinking is permitted, and the Halakha is according to the Sages. The men of Tiberias retracted and broke the duct/pipe.
מוליאר – They explained in the Gemara (Tractate Shabbat 41a and Rashi’s commentary) – water from inside and coals from outside and it is a utensil that has a small receptacle near its wall from the outside which is attached to it, and they place there the coals and water in the large receptable on the Sabbath, and even though it warmed a bit from the warmth of the utensil, because it does not add vapor, but preserves and maintains their heat that it not become cold.
אנטיכי – it is a copper utensil which has two rims/saucers [at the bottom of the vessel and they place the water above and the fire below between the two saucers and since the fire is below between the two rims/saucers, the heat remains more and even though the coals were raked from the eve of the Sabbath, the water is heated up in it on the Sabbath – therefore we don’t drink from them on Shabbat.

Mishnah 5

המימם – the copper kettle that they place on top of the fire to heat the water that is in it.
שפינהו – [that they removed it] from on top of the double stove and there is within it hot water.
לא יתן לתוכו – a bit of [cold] water in order that it can be heated from the water that remained within the vessel for heating water for this is like cooking on Shabbat.
אבל נותן לתוכו – a lot of water until everything returns to be lukewarm/tepid.
או לתוך הכוס – even though it is a second-degree utensil, especially to make them tepid, it is permitted, but not a little bit of [cold] water in order to heat them, for the Tanna/teacher of this Mishnah holds a that a second-degree utensil cooks and further on [in this Mishnah] we are taught that he may put them into a tureen or a plate, which implies that a second-degree utensil does not cook and the Halakha is that a second-degree utensil does not cook.
שהעבירן – from the fire.
מרותחין – at twilight.
לא יתן לתוכן תבלין – from after it gets dark for a first-degree utensil – all the time that it boils, it cooks.

לכל הוא נותן – even into a first-degree utensil.
חוץ מדבר שיש בו חומץ או ציר – that drips from the saltiness of the fish and they cook the spices, but the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Yehuda. But especially spices that are prohibited to place in a first-degree utensil even after they have removed it from the fire, but salt, even in a first-degree utensil does not cook, other than over the fire alone. Therefore, it is permissible to put salt, even in a first-degree utensil, after they have removed it from the fire.

Mishnah 6

אין נותנין – on the Sabbath.
כלי תחת הנר לקבל בו את השמן – that drips because the oil is Muktzeh/set aside and designated for a special purpose, and forbidden for any other use or handling and it is forbidden to nullify a utensil from its place, that is to say, to restore a utensil in a place that it is not able anymore to take it from there, for it is like he establishing for it a place and attaching it with plaster, and it is similar to creative work and this utensil, when the oil falls into it becomes Muktzeh and it is forbidden to handle it.
אין ניאותין – we don’t benefit from the dripping oil from the candle on the Sabbath because it is not from something prepared for it was designated for kindling.
מטלטלין נר חדש – which is not repulsive, and it appropriate to use it.
אבל לא ישן – not counted on (and therefore forbidden to handle) on account of its repulsiveness (see Talmud Shabbat 44a).
חוץ מן הנר הדולק – while it is still burning, it is prohibited, as a decree lest one extinguish it. But Rabbi Shimon does not agree with Muktzeh on account of its repulsiveness nor Muktzeh in consequence of a ritual prohibition (e.g., a candlestick which on the entrance of the Sabbath could not be moved because a light was burning on it), and the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Shimon who permits carrying all candles except from the candle that is burning for the candle, once it was kindled for the Sabbath evening, even though it is that it was extinguished, it is prohibited to carry it all the entire Shabbat, because once it became Muktzeh at twilight, it became Muktzeh for the entire [Sabbath] day, but [regarding] the other candles, the Halakha is according to him, for there is no Muktzeh on the Sabbath other than Muktzeh because the object is too expensive for a use for which it is not originally made, which Rabbi Shimon agrees with.
נותנים כלי תחת הנר – on Shabbat to receive the sparks of the flame that is dripping from the candle in order that it will not kindle what is below it, for the sparks have nothing of substance and the utensil is not canceled out from its use by this.
לא יתן בתוכו מים – even from the Eve of the Sabbath, for they (i.e., the Rabbis) decreed the Eve of the Sabbath on account of the Sabbath, and on the Sabbath if they did it in such a manner, it would be considered extinguishing and one would be liable. Therefore, it is prohibited on the Eve of the Sabbath.

Chapter 4



Mishnah 1

במה טומנין – A person who comes to remove a pot from on to of a double stove on the Eve of the Sabbath and to cover it (i.e., put dishes in the chafing stove to keep them warm) with another thing, and the Sages said that we don’t cover them with something that adds vapor but rather with a thing that preserves the vapor. What is the thing that adds and is prohibited?
לא בגפת – the refuse of olives and sesame when gathered together very hot.
לחים – they have a lot of vapor, more than when dry.
זגין – grape peels, the pomace/shells of grapes, and seeds of grapes.
מוכין – every soft thing is called מוכין/soft, spongy substance – like wool of a vine, detached pieces of soft wool of an animal and the scrapings-off of outworn garments.
בזמן שהן לחין – all of these refer to straw and pomace of grapes and soft-spongy substance and grasses, and moist things that they mentioned [but] moist on account of themselves, not moist on account of liquids that fell upon them after they had dried and moist soft-spongy substances on account of themselves which we find like wool that is close to the tail or wool that is between the thigh of cattle.
נסורת – the fine saw-dust/chips that the carpenters saw/plane from the tree when they saw it with a saw.
נעורת – very thin, when they thoroughly beat the flax (Talmud Shabbat 49a), and they empty it out.
ר"י אוסר בדקה – thin hatchelled flax, but with fine chips/saw-dust he admits that they permit it whether they are thin or thick, but the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Yehuda. For what they (i.e., the Rabbis) prohibited to cover up while it was still day is a something that increases/adds vapor as a decree lest they cover it with hot ashes and he will come to stir the coals when it gets dark, and they forbid to cover it up on the Sabbath with something that does not increase vapor, and even though they do not nullify the decree lest they find his pot that has cooled off and heat it up with fire on the Sabbath. But at twilight [on Friday], it is permissible to cover it up with something that does not increase vapor as we said at the end of the chapter [two of Tractate Shabbat] “במה מדליקין ] – “With what may we kindle the Sabbath lights” for we are not able to make the decree lest he find that his pot has cooled off and he will heat it, for mere pots at twilight are hot. And Maimonides explained that mere pots at twilight are hot, as he explains, that the opinion does not suffer it because of the confusion of textual versions, for the textual versions are opposite each other, for he found in the Gemara that was before him in the chapter במה מדליקין/With what may we kindle the Sabbath candles – that he had the reading – for what reason did they say that we don’t cover it up with a thing that does not increase vapor once it becomes dark, as a decree lest he cover it with hot ashes, and for what reasons did they say that we don’t cover it with something that increases vapor while it is still daylight (on Friday) , decreed lest it becomes hot, and the readings are not such, but rather, for what reason did they say that we don’t cover them with a thing that does not increase vapor once it becomes dark as a decree lest it become hot and we don’t cover it with a thing that adds vapor while it is still daylight, as a decree lest he cover it with hot ashes.

Mishnah 2

שלחין – hides, it is the Aramaic translation of “he stripped/flayed [skin] and stretched forth.
ומטלטלין אותן – whether he covered them or whether he didn’t cover them for it appears like he mixed them – that is to say, to rely upon them.
ואין מטלטלין אותן – for they are Muktzeh/forbidden for use and/or handling on the Sabbath to spin or to weave, and even though he covered them for the time, he did not make them ownerless completely, and when he couldn’t designate them out for covering, but designated them for covering from carrying them.
כיצד יעשה – this one who covered them, how shall he take his pot – since it is prohibited to carry them and it is all covered in them.
נוטל – the cover of the pot that has the status of a utensil upon it, and even though that they are upon it, and we don’t care that it was not make a base for them, for it was not made other than to cover the pot.
רבי אלעזר אומר קופה מטה על צדה ונוטל – when he comes to take it, he tilts the basket on its side lest he take the pot and the wool-sheerings that from one side and from the other into the hole that is in the pot and if it is required to go back and to cover it, he won’t be able to carry the sheerings from here and there and to make a hole and return them into it.
וחכ"א נוטל – [The Sages state that he takes] the pot and if the wool- sheerings fell out, and the hole did not become ruined, he returns pot to its place, and they did not prohibit him to take the pot, ab initio, a decreed lest the hole become ruined. But the Sages admit that if the hole did become ruined, he should not return the objects, and the Halakha is according to the Sages.
לא יכסנו משתחשך – for it is forbidden to cover it on the Sabbath, whether it is something that adds vapor, whether it is something that does not add vapor in the manner of covering it.
ונותן – on the Sabbath, under the pillow that he places under his head, and even though it is filled with spongy-wool substance or feathers, this is not the manner of covering with it.
כסת – larger than a pillow.

יוצאות צרורורת ליבש – Rabbi Yehudah holds like the first teacher [of the Mishnah] that it is not a burden; however, to [keep them] dry which is fastened better one cannot make this decree lest it miscarry which it comes to include, but for milk where it is not fastened well, it is forbidden and we suspect lest it miscarry which it comes to include. And the Halakha is according to the first teacher [of the Mishnah].

Chapter 6



Mishnah 1

במה אשה. שבראשה – it refers to all with threads of wool and flax and a strap that plaits/twists on them the hair of her head. And what is the reason that she should not go out with them on the Sabbath? Because the Sages stated that she should not immerse in them on weekdays until they become weak/decay, therefore on the Sabbath, she should not go out in them lest perhaps she remove it when she is engaging in the commanded ritual immersion and unties them and comes to carry them four cubits in the public domain
עד שתרפם – to permeate/penetrate them a bit and that they would be softened and that water could enter between them so that they would not leave a space between the partitions during the ritual immersion.
בטוטפת – a fringe that they tie on the forehead from ear to ear.

לרה"ר – but to the courtyard, it is permitted, and everything mentioned above is prohibited, even in the courtyard, for they decreed concerning this that a woman should not decorate herself on Shabbat at all, neither in the courtyard nor in the public domain, but the hair-net they permitted so as to not prohibit all of her ornaments and become repulsive to her husband. But Maimonides explained that the public domain refers to all of the ornaments that are mentioned in our Mishnah and all of them are not forbidden but as a decree lest a woman bring them four cubits within the public domain.
עיר של זהב – a golden crown made like the shape of Jerusalem.

Mishnah 1

כלל גדול. השוכח עיקר שבת– since he thought that Shabbat is not in the Torah, and even though that from the beginning, he had heard [about Shabbat] but now had forgotten it.
אינו חייב אלא חטאת – on all the Sabbaths that he had desecrated for all of it is one [inadvertent] error as it is written (Exodus 31:13): “you must keep my Sabbaths,” and which implies one observance for any Sabbaths.
היודע עיקר שבת – that is Shabbat in the Torah and creative work was forbidden on it, but he did many forms of creative work on many Sabbaths via the inadvertent error on Shabbat for he does not know that Shabbat is today, he is liable for each and every Shabbat one sin, and on this, it is stated (Exodus 31:16): “The Israelite people shall keep the Sabbath” that implies that observance of each and every Shabbat, that is to say that he is liable for a sin-offering on each and every Sabbath and even though that it was not known to him in the meantime and it is one act of forgetfulness, we say that the days that are in-between that is a knowledge that is impossible that he hadn’t heard [about Shabbat] in the meanwhile that this day was Shabbat but he was not reminded of the creative works that he did on it. Therefore, each and every Shabbat is one error.
היודע שהוא שבת ועשה מלאכות הרבה – that he did not know that the forms of creative work were forbidden and he performed them several times on several Sabbaths, he is liable for each of the chief labors that are forbidden on the Sabbath one sin-offering and even though he went back and repeated them (i.e., the forbidden labors) on several Sabbaths, each principal form of labor is one error and he was not informed about it in the interim and here one cannot say that the days in-between are considered knowledge [of them] to differentiate, for the days in-between he would not know which chief labor is forbidden and which is permitted other than if he sat and engaged before Sages in the laws of Shabbat. And the same law applies that he is liable on two derivatives of two primary forbidden forms of labor whereby each one is divided into one sin-offering apiece, but if he had done a principal form of forbidden labor and its derivative or two derivatives of one principal forbidden labor, he is not liable other than for one [sin-offering] as it is taught at the end of the Mishnah: A person who performs many forbidden actions of one prohibited labor [on the Sabbath], he is not liable for other than for one [sin-offering] such as two derivatives of one primary forbidden labor because it is like a person who performed an action and repeated it in one act of forgetfulness and there is no separation/division of sin-offerings with one act of forgetfulness but other than the actual transgression which is not similar or distinguished on [many] Sabbaths for the matter of an error on Shabbat.

Mishnah 2

הזורע החורש - the fact that “ploughing” is not taught at the beginning and the Mishnah and afterwards “sowing” like the way of the whole world is to inform us that if the land was hard and they ploughed and then sewed and then afterwards ploughed, he is liable for the second ploughing because of “ploughing.”

If he stirs the pot and places a covering on top of the pot that is standing on the fire, he is liable because of [the prohibition of] cooking and all of these above are considered in our Mishnah: “One who sews, ploughs, threshes, etc., all of these are with spices of color in the building of the Tabernacle.

המולחו והמעבדו – The Gemara (Tractate Shabbat 75b) that salting the skin is the same as curing the skin, but they exclude one of them and place marking lines in its place, for placing marking lines is one of the primary prohibited forms of labor.

מכה בפטיש – the completion of work for so the artisan strikes the block with the completion of the work and the striking with a hammer is not liable until the end of the work [has been reached]. But the number of the first teacher of the Mishnah who counts primary forms of work as forty minus one, even though he returns and considers each one individually comes to teach us that even if a person did all the work in the world on one Shabbat in one act of forgetfulness, it is impossible that he would be liable for more than forty sin-offerings for all of them the rest of the labors are derivatives to these primary forms of work and it is found that he performs a primary form of work and its derivative and is not liable for anything other than one.

אמר ר"ע מנין לעבודת כוכבים שמטמאת במשא – since they are concerned above with an Asmakhta/a scriptural text used as a support for a rabbinic enactment and the Biblical verse of (Isaiah 30:22): “You will cast them away like a menstruous woman,” it is a support to the Biblical verse that was brought above (Isaiah 30:14 – see Tractate Shabbat, Chapter 8, Mishnah 7): “So that no shard is left in its breakage;” alternatively, because it was necessary to teach (Tractate Shabbat, Chapter 9, Mishnah 3), “from where do we learn that we wash the circumcised child on the third day if it falls on the Sabbath?,” they taught these which are compared to it.
מטמאה במשא – a person who carries it should wash his clothes and even if he didn’t touch it, such as it was in a box or something like that, and the Rabbis dispute on the statement of Rabbi Akiba and state that he does not become ritually defiled other than through contact like an unclean reptile, and the Halakha is according to the Sages.
תזרם כמו (אשה) דוה – that is to say, it should be in your eyes like foreigners like depressed like a menstruant woman, as it is written (Leviticus 15:33): “and concerning her who is in menstrual infirmity” and the Biblical verse is speaking about idolatry.

שזורעים בה חמשה זרעונים – and there is within it in order to set aside between them the appropriate difference so there will not be any confusion/mixture.
ארבעה בארבע רוחות להערוגה – they fill each direction until near the corner and in the middle, they don’t sow other than one globule in order that the globule that is in the center will be distant three handbreadths from what is sown in each direction, for the measure of absorption of each sown area is one-and-one-half handbreadths , and even though that nearest the corners in the directions of the seeds that are closest to each other, and there isn’t between them a distance of three handbreadths, and they absorb from each other, and in this case there is no room for doubt, for the Biblical verse was strict only about Kilayim/mixed seeds, and there was no confusion, and we don’t concern ourselves about absorption as it is taught in the Mishnah (Tractate Bava Batra, Chapter 2, Mishnah 12): “If there was a fence between them, this one relies on the fence from this direction and the other relies on the fence from that direction” and even though they absorb from underneath , and here there is a large recognition that the the this direction is sown to the north and the south and that direction is sown to the east and the west, but between the intermediate seed to the seeds of the directions, there is no recognition, and if they were brought close, there would be confusion; therefore, there is a need for distance in order to absorb.
שנאמר כי כארץ תוציא צמחה – (through the analysis of words in the verse – Isaiah 61:11: “For just as the earth brings forth her growth, and a garden makes the seed shoot up, (So the LORD God will make victory and renown shoot up in the presence of the nations”]) – "תוציא" /bring forth – is one; "צמחה"/her growth – is one; "זרועיה"/the seed – is two; "תצמיח"/shoot up – is one – that makes five. But the six handbreadths cannot be derived from Biblical verse but rather it is established by the Rabbis that the five rows of plants in six handbreadths, the four corners will not absorb from the middle and the middle will not [absorb] from the corners, for the measurement of absorption of each seed is a handbreadth and a half; therefore, Scripture hints that five rows of plants in one bed that is six handbreadths, is as stated. And in Tractate Kilayim, I explained the laws of a a bed and its details and its specifications, but here I shortened it.

Mishnah 3

שהיא טמאה – for on the third day, her semen has not yet become decayed – and she is worthy to conceive and to have a fetus created from her and we call it semen – that is worthy of being sown.
לשלשה ימים – for Scripture was strict on those who were defiled by emissions at the Giving of the Torah, therefore, it separated them three days and did not concern itself if they would discharge afterwards on the forth day of separation that decays/is offensive and not worthy of being sown. And the Halakhic decision is that the a woman who discharges on the third day is ritually pure, and our Mishnah is a faulty version, and should teach: “From when does a woman who discharges semen on the third day that she is ritually pure, as it states (Exodus 19:15): “Be ready for the third day: [do not go near a woman].” And the three days that are mentioned in the Biblical verse is equivalent to the third day, for on the third day of separation, the Torah was given. Alternatively, it (i.e., our Mishnah) is not a faulty version but rather, it is [the Rabbis of Rabbi] Eleazar ben Azariah [who] hold that she who emits on the third day is impure, and the Halakha is not [like them].
מנין שמרחיצין וכו' – even in hot water that was heated on the Sabbath, for even on the third day, [the child] is in danger, and all the more so, on the first and second days, for hot water strengthens the body of the baby boy and heals him.
לשון של זהורית – like the language of a red wool that they would tie half on the head of the goat that was sent to Azazel and half on the precipice, and when the goat was pushed down, the strip would turn white and everyone knew that their sins were atoned for.

Mishnah 4

מנין לסיכה שהיא כשתיה – not actually like drinking to make him liable for extirpation, but that it is forbidden.

על הכתם – that is found in the clothing and it is not known if it is the blood of a menstruant woman or not – we remove seven things to examine him with them, and among them are these four signs, but the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Yehuda (see Tractate Niddah, Chapter 6, Mishnah 9).

שמצניעים אותו לנונזו – for every sacred thing required being hidden away.
מאומה – so we see that the Biblical verse thought to forbid it and he does a great repair, and he removes idolatry from his house, but the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Yehuda.

הרוכלין - those who sell spices for the decoration of women and they have small boxes for the stones of the spices.

פחות מכגרוגרת – even though all the foods, their measure is like a dried-fig’s bulk, these, since they exist for planting even with less that a dried-fig’s bulk, they are liable, but the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteyra who said five.
זרע קשואין – it is more important than the other seeds of the garden, and similarly, the seeds of gourds and the seeds of Egyptian beans, and he calls them “Fasli” in the foreign language.

Chapter 11



Mishnah 1

הזורק מרשות היחיד לרשות הרבים – the private/individual domain is a place that is surrounded by four partitions ten handbreadths high and between them are four handbreadths by four handbreadths or more, even if there are several miles, if they surrounded for living such as a district/province/large town which is surrounded by a wall and its doors are locked at night and their alleys have three walls and a stake fastened in the ground by the side of a wall, serving as a mark or as fictitious partition/enclosure for the purposes of enabling those who live there to move objects on the Sabbath in the fourth direction, and similarly a large hill that is ten [handbreadths] high and four [handbreadths] wide or an incision/trench that is ten [handbreadths] deep and four [handbreadths] wide and even utensils such as a boat or a tower of wood and things like them, if they have [a circumference of four by four at a height of ten , all of these are the public domain. And the airspace of the private domain is like the private domain up to the sky. And the thickness of the walls of the private domain are judged as the private domain. But the public domain is like the marketplaces and the desert streets and the roads open to them and it should be that the width of the path is sixteen cubits and there should not be a ceiling upon it. And there is one who holds that it also requires that six-hundred thousand people pass through it every day like the marches of the Israelites in the desert (see Tractate Shabbat 98a). But the airspace of the public domain is not like the public domain other than up to ten handbreadths for above from ten [handbreadths] is free/exempt. But a place that lacks four by four [handbreadths] and is or higher than three [handbreadths] is the exempt/free space and even thorns and thistles and excrement in the public domain that are at least three [handbreadths] or higher but lack four by four [handbreadths] are considered an exempt place. But a place that is surrounded by four partitions whose height is from three [handbreadths] to ten and it has four by four [handbreadths] or more, or a hill/mound that has four by four [handbreadths] or more which is higher than three [handbreadths] up to ten or a ditch which has four by four [handbreadths] and is deep from three until ten [handbreadths] or an alley that is closed from three directions and lacks a mark as a fictitious partition/enclosure or a beam on the fourth direction, and the sea and the valley – all of these are a Karmelit. The explanation of a Karmelit (a marked-off plot in a public thoroughfare – which cannot be considered either private or public domain) is like a “widow” – that is to say, like a widow who is not a virgin, nor married to a husband. Such is this domain which is neither a private domain nor a public domain and the airspace of a Karmelit is like a Karmelit up until ten [handbreadths] and above that, it is considered an exempt space. A person who removes something from the private domain to the public domain or brings something in from the public domain to the private domain is liable for a sin-offering (see Tractate Shabbat, Chapter 1, Mishnah 1). From a private domain to a Karmelite and/or from a public domain to a Karmelit, or from a Karmelite to either of them is exempt but it is forbidden. [A person who brings something] from a private domain or from a public domain to an exempt space or from the exempt space to both of them -it is ab initio permitted, and we don’t have to say, from a Karmelit to an exempt space and from an exempt space to a Karmelit it is permitted. But a person who transfers an object from the beginning of the four cubits to the end of the four cubits in the public domain is liable for a sin-offering. In a Karmelit, he is exempt, but it is forbidden. In the private domain and in the exempt place, it is permissible ab initio to carry and transfer throughout the entire domain and even if it several miles.
ר"ע מחייב – for he holds that since the object has passed in the airspace of the public domain, within ten [handbreadths], it is as if it has come to rest; but the Rabbis hold that something absorbed in the midst of the ten [handbreadths] of airspace of the public domain is not like someone who placed it there, but above from ten [handbreadths] it is an exempt space, and no disputes that he is exempt, and the Halakha is according to the Sages.

Mishnah 2

כיצד – the Rabbis mention this.
שתי גזוזאראות – these are boards that go out from the wall of the upper story and outward on the public domain, but the balconies themselves are the private domain, and when they are opposite each other on the two sides of the public domain, the individual who stretches out [his hand] and throws from one to the other is exempt, for we do not find throwing and stretching out in the [forbidden] labors of the Tabernacle from the [one] private domain to the [other] private domain and the expanse of the public domain interrupts between them.
היו שתיהן בדיוטא אחת – that is to say, one floor along the length of the private domain and there is an interruption of the public domain between them.
הזורק פטור – for since he is higher than ten [handbreadths] and we dd not find throwing from one private domain to [another] private domain via the public domain in the Tabernacle but the person who stretches [his hand] is liable, and he though he stretches higher than ten [handbreadths], for we found that stretching forth and similar to it in the Tabernacle from one private domain to [another] private domain and the length of the public domain interrupts between them.
שכן היתה עבודת הלוים – stretching forth from this [wagon] to that [wagon] above ten [handbreadths] and the length of the pubic domain in the middle. How so? [Two] wagons one after another in the public domain and those who unload the Tabernacle would stretch forth to those that were on the wagons that were next to them, nearby and close and they would stretch forth to those who were in front of them and everyone from the wagons were in the private domain.
אבל לא זורקים – for the boards were not thrown because of their heaviness.
חוליית הבור – dirt that we remove from the digging of pit, it was customary to place around the opening of the pit like a wall and we derive that the pit and its segment of earth cut out in digging a pit and piled up on its borders combine to ten [handbreadths] and we teach that the pit to its depth and we teach a rock to its height.
הנוטל מהן – [a person who takes from them] and places in the public domain or wh takes from the public domain and places upon them - is liable [a sin-offering].

Mishnah 3

הזורק ד' אמות בכותל – from the beginning of the four cubits to the end of the four [cubits] and it came to rest on the wall that is close to the public domain, higher than ten handbreadths, such as a case where there was a thick cake of pressed figs that was attached to the wall higher than ten handbreadths in the public domain, it is an exempt space.
למטה מעשרה כזורק בארץ – from the beginning of the four [cubits] to the end of four [cubits] in the public domain and he is liable, even though there is not from the place of the uprooting of the object to the wall other than four cubits exactly, we did not state the thickness of the cake of pressed figs is excluded from the four cubits and we don’t have here from the beginning of the four [cubits] to the end of the four [cubits] , for it does not exclude the pressed figs on the wall, its thickness does not exclude anything.
ונתגלגל חוץ לד"א פטור – for he did not intend for a throwing of liability.
ונתגלגל לתוך ד"א חייב – and it came to rest a bit outside of the four cubits prior to rolling inwards.

Mishnah 4

הזורק בים – from the beginning of four [cubits] to the end of four [cubits], he is exempt, for it is a Karmelit.
רקק מים – which are not higher from the land, and there is in them mud and clay/plaster and they are called a [shallow] pool/diluvium.
ור"ה מהלכת בו – for many [people] walk through it.
וכמה הוא רקק – what is its depth that we can say that it is yet the public domain and it has not become a Karmelit?
ורקק מים ורה"ר מהלכת בו – this is double that was taught for the matter to teach us that even if the pool was four [cubits] wide, for since it was less than ten [cubits] high, it is judged like the public domain, and double also with a public domain going through it to teach us that even though many people don’t walk through it other than in an emergency/need, walking even in an emergency is called walking.

Mishnah 5

מן הים ליבשה – from a Karmelit to the public domain.
מן הים לספינה – from a Karmelit to the private domain.
מטלטלין מזו לזו – if they belong to two individuals, one carries via an Eruv, for it is likened to two separate courtyards.
מוקפות – each is near the other like we don’t surround swellings/abcesses.
אין מטלטלין – for this is how they explain each other: the Karmelit interrupts between them and nullifies the Eruv.

Mishnah 6

הזורק – [he throws] on the Sabbath inadvertently and is reminded that it is Shabbat after the stone left from under his hand before it came to rest, even if another did not receive/intercept it, but rather it came to rest in a natural manner, he is exempt, for such is taught further on [in our Mishnah] : until its beginning and its end are inadvertent,” for this, its beginning is inadvertent and its end is on purpose/wanton, for since he was reminded that it was Shabbat prior to it coming to a rest, and our Mishnah, this is how it to be explained: A person who throws and then is reminded [that it is Shabbat] after it left from under his hand; alternatively, he was not reminded until the other [person] intercepted/received it, etc., for this is a case where two who performed this act, they are exempt; for if it came to rest, he Is liable to a sin offering in the four cubits when he returned and forgot, but if he didn’t return and forgot, he is exempt, for all those liable for a sin offering, etc.
זה הכלל – which includes also transferring an object form place to place – for if he uprooted it inadvertently and was reminded that it was Shabbat prior his putting it down, he is exempt.

והמכה בפטיש – this is the conclusion of work of those who cut stones, for after he cuts stones from the mountain surrounding him and he has severed it, he strikes a large blow with his hammer and it breaks apart and falls, and all who complete [forbidden] work in Shabbat, it is a derivative of striking the final hammer blow.

משום רושם – a sign/mark that they would make on the planks/boards of the Tabernacle for they take \it apart, and when they re-erect it, they should not confuse the order of the boards/planks, but Rabbi Yosi comes to state that even if he did not write other than making two mere markings as a sign, he is liable. But the Halakha is not like Rabbi Yosi.

And the "סיט" is according to the interruption that exists between the thumb to the finger – all that a person is able to widen it – and the measurement of this width is doubled – this is the double "סיט" -and the width between the thumb and the finger once – is also as far as the distance of a double "סיט" because it has double like that which is between the thumb and the [index] finger.

קושרין דלי של פסיקיא – on the mouth of the well so that it would tied and suspended there, for the fascia does not nullify it, but not with a rope that does nullify it (see Talmud Shabbat 113a), for it is an enduring knot.

רבי יהודה מתיר – Rabbi Yehuda did not permit anything other than a rope of a common weaver that requires it for his work and does not nullify it there, but the Rabbis hold that if you were to permit to him the rope of a weaver, he would tie it with other also ropes for ropes are interchangeable, and the Halakha is according to the Sages.

Mishnah 3

But on the new [clothing]also, we did not state this other than on white, but not on colored clothing, for the folding of colored clothing repairs them the most, but on white [clothing] also, we did not state other than if he lacks any other clothing to change into, but if he has other clothing to change into for the honor of the Sabbath, it is prohibited to fold them.
מיום הכפורים לשבת – when Yom Kippur occurs on the Eve of Shabbat since Shabbat is more stringent than Yom Kippur and that of Yom Kippur is not sacrificed on the Sabbath for it is considered a burnt-offering of a weekday on the Sabbath.

Mishnah 1

כל כתבי קדש – even [the works of the] Prophets and Writings, we save them from a courtyard that a fire had fallen upon it [and bring them] to another courtyard that was in the same alley, even though they did not create a symbolic community of residence and this (i.e., the works of the Prophets and the Writings) which would be written in the modern form of Hebrew type and in the holy language.
בין שקורין בהן – such as the Prophet/Haftarah [portions] that we read on Shabbat in the synagogue.
בין שאין קורין בהן – such as the Writings, for even individuals should not read them on Shabbat because [it would lead to] being idle from the Bet Midrash/House of study as above when they would preach sermons to the people on the Sabbath where they teach them the laws of prohibitions and what is permitted, because on all of the weekdays, the people are engaged in their labors/work and they (i.e., the Rabbis) forbade the reading of the Writings on Shabbat at the time of the Bet Midrash/House of Study they pull at the hearts and come to prevent them to ear the sermon.
ואעפ"י שכתובים בכל לשון – and there is an opinion that states that they didn’t give [them permission] to read them and we don’t save them nevertheless they require the removal [and storage] of sacred object and it is forbidden to place them in an ownerless place.

Mishnah 2

מציליין מזון ג' סעודות – and even though that with legal permission he busied himself but only to a courtyard where there is a symbolic community of residence (i.e., an Eruv) alone, but nevertheless, they did not permit to him to save more because a person is pressed regarding his money, and if it was permitted to him, he would come go out (and collect more).
נפלה דליקה בלילי שבת – for to eating.

Mishnah 3

מצילין סל מלא ככרות – since at one time he saves It, what does it matter if it is a little or a lot.
ועגול של דבילה – even though it is large and he has man meals.
ואם היו פקחים – and they know that if they ask for payment as workers, they are not taking payment on the Sabbath since initially, they are not aware that it is the payment for work that they came, they make a bill for him after the Sabbath and we are dealing with someone who fears Heaven and even though that is from lawlessness that he has become worthy and what he has saved is his, nevertheless, it is not enjoyable for him that he does not have from others for he knows that by force it was made ownerless, and for nothing also he does not enjoy it, for he troubled for it and therefore, he takes his payment.

Mishnah 4

ולשם הוא מוציא – for the first teacher [of the Mishnah] to a courtyard with an Eruv and for Ben Beteira, to a courtyard without an Eruv.
כלי תשמישו - that he needs it and for that same day for the meal.

בואו והצילו עמי – just as he saves, so they save, but above where it says [In the Mishnah], “come and save yourselves” for sometimes he saves more than they are able to save such as when he did not support and they supported or its reverse.

Mishnah 5

שידה – made like an Ark.
תיבה – small [tables] of money-changers
ומגדל – Armario in the foreign language and in Arabic – Manshar, and all of them are made of wood.
מפני שהוא מחרך – for the fire Is not seized by it (i.e., only scorched) and it saves the wooden utensil from burning.
בין מלאים – [whether filled with] water.
שאין יכולין לקבל את האור – because they are new and Rabbi Yosi holds that an indirect extinction of he a fire (by placing vessels filled with water in its way) is prohibited (see Talmud Shabbat 120b), even in a place where there is a financial loss, but the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Yosi.

Mishnah 6

אין אומרים לו כבה – for telling a heathen [to extinguish] because his abstention from labor [is no concern of theirs].
ואל תכבה – one does not need to warn them but he should leave him alone and he will put it (i.e., the fire) out because his abstention from labor is no concern of theirs, because the Israelite/Jew is not warned about the abstention from labor of a heathen who is not his servant.

Mishnah 7

כופין קערה – of earthenware on top of the candle as long as it will not be extinguished and even though he takes a utensil for the saving of a beam which is not taken on the Sabbath for this contradicts what Rabbi Yitzhak says that is utensil is not taken other than for the needs of something taken and teaches regarding it when it is necessary for the place of the utensil, then it is permitted to carry it for the needs of its place.
ועל צואה של קטן – not the excrement of a small child is spoken of but the removal of the excrement and it is permitted to carry it and remove it to the trash, but this is what it means: [it is speaking of] excrement of chickens so that a minor child will not slap it with his hands and become dirty through it, and such when this excrement is placed in the trash that is in the courtyard so that he will not be thrown before it and not the removal of the excrement; therefore, it is not permitted to carry and remove it, but one covers it with a dish so that a minor doesn’t become dirty.
מעשה בא – the inverting of a utensil on a scorpion.
בערב – name of a place.
חושש אני לו מחטאת – for since a scorpion did not run after me, I am doubtful lest he is liable for a sin-offering because of [the prohibition of laying a trap/hunting. And regarding a Halakhic decision, those poisonous creatures that bite and certainly put [people] to death such as venomous serpents and a mad dog, it is permitted to kill them immediately when he sees them and even when they don’t run after him, but those which do not bite, and we certainly put them to death but sometimes we put them to death and sometimes we don’t put them to death but if they don’t run after him, he covers them with a utensil and if he stamped on them and killed them innocently it is permitted, but to hunt a snake because he wants to play with it, it is prohibited.

Mishnah 8

מילא מים – from a well in the public thoroughfare.
כבש – they make on a large ship to descend by it from the ship to the dry land and it was necessary for the teacher [of the Mishnah] to teach us about a candle and water, for if the teacher [of the Mishnah] had only taught the candle, one would think that it is a candle that is permitted, for it is impossible to make a decree lest it be increased for a Jew/Israelite, for a candle for one is a candle for one-hundred, but regarding water, one would be able to decree that it is prohibited. But if the Mishnah only taught regarding water, one would think that it is water that is for the Jew that is prohibited, but a candle, even though it was for a Jew, since he (i.e., the non-Jew) also needs it, it is permissible for the candle for since a candle for one is like a candle for one-hundred, [both] are necessary. But a ramp, even though it is similar to a candle as a ramp for one is a ramp for one-hundred, because of the episode related of Rabban Gamaliel and the elders the teacher of the Mishnah taught it as the practical decision is a teacher (a guiding precedent).

But a utensil that is used for some kind of prohibited labor, such as mortars and millstone and similar things for its own necessity and for the needs of its place, it is permitted, but from the sun to the shade or because of thieves, it is prohibited.
רבי נחמיה אומר אין ניטלין אלא לצורך – It is explained in the Talmud (Talmud Shabbat 124b) for the needs of its unique use alone but not for the needs of something else, even for its own needs, such as a knife to cut with alone, it is permitted, and not to support with it the bowl.

אבל לא את האוצר – that is to say, only that he should no complete the entire hoarded up treasure until he reaches its bottom, for perhaps he will come to make holes/indentations.

דמאי – because it is fit for the poor as is taught in the Mishnah (Tractate Demai, Chapter 3, Mishnah 1): “We feed the poor and to quarter given to troops on march/transient poor men produce about which there is a suspicion as to whether or not the tithes were appropriately taken,” and if he requires it he would make ownerless his possessions and would be poor and be fit for it; now also the poor is fit for it.
ותרומת מעשר שניטלה תרומתו – the tithe of the tithe which the Levite owes to the Kohen that was taken from it but he did not take the Great Tithe (i.e., the 2% that goes from an Israelite to a Kohen) such as the case where a Levite anticipated first and took the [First] Tithe in the ears of corn but had not yet occurred the obligation of Terumah/priest’s due, for the grain is not liable for Terumah until it becomes shaped into an even pile, and he (i.e., the Levite) advanced and took the [First] Tithe of the ears of corn does not separate anything other than the tithe of the tithe which the Levite owes to the Kohen alone, and he is permitted to consume it even though the Great Tithe was not yet separated out.

ולא מעשר שני והקדש שלא נפדו – such as the case when they were redeemed, but not redeemed according to Halakha, such as when he redeemed the Second tithe out of fragments of vessels/broken ware, which is no longer a vessel or rubbish (see Tractate Shabbat 123a) and not Second Tithe which is redeemed with money that has upon them a shape/form, as it is written (Deuteronomy 14:25): “[You may convert them into money.] Wrap up the money [and take it with you to the place the LORD your God has chosen].” But sanctified things are not redeemed with land, as it is written (Leviticus 27:23): “and he shall pay the assessment as of that day”- a thing that is given from hand to hand.
לוף – a kind of a legume which is not appropriate raw even for animals. But Maimonides explained it is a from the species of onions.
לעורבין – like the rich people who raise ravens to adulthood, but the Halakha is not according to Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.

שנוטל אחת ומניח אחת – when the baby moves his legs, he places one leg down and lifts up the other.
אבל גורר אסור – when she carries him, and everywhere in the Mishnah where Rabbi Yehuda says, "אימתי"/”from when,” he does not come to dispute, but rather to explain the words of the Sages. Therefore, the Halakha is according to him.

Mishnah 3

אין מילדין – we do not draw forth the fetus from the womb on the Jewish holy day, for there is greater trouble.
אבל מסעדין – holds the fetus so that it would not fall to the ground.
חכמה – an expert midwife.
ממקום למקום – and we don’t worry about the prohibition of [Sabbath] boundaries.

From the seventh to the thirtieth [day], even if she said: “I need [assistance].” We do not violate [the Sabbath]. But we perform her needs through a non-Jew because she is like a lick person which is not in a dangerous situation, and any thing where there is no danger, we perform her needs through a non-Jew.

שאי אפשר לעשותה מע"ש – such as the actual circumcision for it is impossible to do it for its [appropriate] time is the eighth day which overrides the Sabbath and the Halakha is according to Rabbi Akiba.

ופורעין – the skin covering the top of the membrum virile (i.e., the corona)/split the membrane and pull it down.
ומוצצין – [to suck] the blood [and compress the blood vessels of the wound in the process] and even though he is making a wound, for the blood does not ooze/secrete [from its junction other than through sucking.

Mishnah 3

מרחיצין את הקטן – this washing is not in its regular manner, as the Tanna/teacher of the end [of the Mishnah] indicates to explain the first part [of the Mishnah] – how do they wash/cleanse? Such as to drip/sprinkle by hand, but even to sprinkle with a utensil is forbidden, and all the more so to wash in the regular manner.
ראב"ע כו' - he disputes the first teacher [of the Mishnah] and he (i.e., Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah) holds that we wash/cleanse the [newborn] baby in the normal manner, whether before the circumcision, [or] whether after the circumcision, and on the third day [after] the circumcision also, whether the water was heated on the eve of the Sabbath (i.e., Friday) or even whether the waters were heated on the Sabbath itself, for it is a matter of danger to life and the Halakha is according to Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah.
ספק – it is doubtful whether a child is eight months old or nine months old, for if he is eight months old, he is like a mere stone and his circumcision does not supersede the Sabbath day.
רבי יהודה מתיר באנדרוגינוס – since it is written (Genesis 17:12): “every male among you shall be circumcised,” including an androgynous individual, but [for] the first teacher [of our Mishnah], (Genesis 17:14) “his foreskin” is written, [meaning] he who is totally uncircumcised, excluding the case of someone who is half-female. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Yehuda.

Mishnah 4

מי שהיו לו שתי תינוקות וכו' - The Amoraim dispute in the Babylonian Talmud (Tractate Shabbat 137a) concerning the textual reading of this Mishnah but the textual reading that that my teachers grabbed hold of as essential is this: He who had two baby boys, one to circumcise [the day] after the Sabbath (i.e., on Sunday) and one to circumcise on the Sabbath but he forgot and circumcised the one of the day after the Sabbath on the Sabbath is liable [for a sin-offering]. If one was to be circumcised on the Eve of the Sabbath (i.e., on Friday), and one (i.e., the other) to be circumcised on the Sabbath, but he forgot and circumcised the one for the Eve of the Sabbath on the Sabbath, Rabbi Eliezer obligates him to bring a sin-offering and Rabbi Yehoshua [says] that he is exempt. And this its explanation: If he forgot and circumcised the one [who was to be circumcised] after the Sabbath (i.e., on Sunday) on the Sabbath, , according to everyone he is liable [for a sin-offering] for he has erred in the matter of the Commandment and did not perform the Mitzvah when he advanced [the circumcision] and circumcised the one for Sunday on the Sabbath, and in this, even Rabbi Yehoshua admits [that he is liable a sin-offering].
אחד למול בשבת ואחד למול בערב שבת ושכח ומל את של ערב שבת בשבת ר' אליעזר מחייב חטאת – for it is a ritual circumcision that was not at the its [appropriate] time and does not supersede the Sabbath, and even though he erred in the matter of [the performance of] a commandment for he was preoccupied with that Sabbath and because of it, erred in it, and even with this, he performed a Mitzvah for it was appropriate to circumcise [his son] but it does not supersede the Sabbath, for Rabbi Eleazar holds that he erred in the matter of a Mitzvah and performed a Mitzvah which does not supersede the Sabbath and he is liable [for a sin-offering].
ור"י פוטר – for he holds that he erred in the matter of a Mitzvah and performed a commandment that does not supersede the Sabbath=, he exempt [from having to bring a sin-offering] because he holds/thought that it was with the permission of the Jewish court that he did it, and the Halakha is according to Rabbi Yehuda.

Mishnah 5

נולד בין השמשות נמול לתשעה – for since the eighth day of the morrow he would be circumcised and lest if [the baby was born] at twilight which was daytime, and he would be circumcised on the ninth day. If the day was the Eve of the Sabbath (i.e., Friday), it is impossible to circumcise him (i.e., the baby boy) on the next Sabbath, for perhaps it is the ninth day, and it would be a circumcision that is not at its [appropriate] time, and it does not supersede the Sabbath and one must wait until after the Sabbath which is the tenth day [since the birth of the baby boy].
חל יום טוב להיות אחר השבת – no circumcision which is [not performed] at its [appropriate] time may supersede it, and he is circumcised on the eleventh day [after his birth].
שני ימים טובים של ראש השנה – for they are one level of sanctity and a circumcision [performed] not at its appropriate time does not supersede the Festival observance of the Second Day of Rosh Hashanah; he is circumcised on the twelfth day [from the day of his birth].
עד שיבריא – and seven complete days in astronomical hours should pass from the day that he is healed, and afterwards, we circumcise him (i.e., the child).

Mishnah 6

ציצין –hidden shreds of flesh that remain from the foreskin.
עטרה – it is a tall rim which surrounds the membrum virile round about and from it slants and descends to its head and the skin that covers most of the corona of the membrum virile as our Mishnah teaches , one should not say most of the coagulation, but even most of its height in one location.
אינו אוכל בתרומה – if he is a Kohen, for an uncircumcised Kohen is prohibited to eat the priest’s due/Terumah. It is said regarding the Passover sacrifice (Exodus 12:45): “No bound or hired laborer shall eat of it,” and it is stated regarding Terumah (Leviticus 22:10): “No bound or hired laborer of a priest shall eat of the sacred donations.” Just as the Passover offering is prohibited to someone uncircumcised, so too the Terumah is prohibited to someone uncircumcised.
ואם היה בעל בשר – if he was fat and flesh appeared that was above his uncircumcised membrum, after the foreskin was taken off completely, as if the flesh returned and covered the membrum virile.
מתקנו – and he slants the cutting utensil/knife from that thickness [of the fat].
מפני מראית העין – so that he would not appear as uncircumcised.
ולא פרע – and he did not reveal it.
כאלו לא מל – and he would go back and split the membrane and pull it down and even if he removed his hand from it – for all the while that he is engaged in the circumcision on the Sabbath, he cuts whether the remaining shreds invalidate the act by omission or whether they don’t invalidate the act by omission after he removes his hand from the shreds which invalidate the act, he returns to the shreds which do not invalidate the act and he doesn’t go back.

Chapter 20



Mishnah 1

רבי אליעזר אומר: תולין את המשמרת – they filter in it the sediment of the wine and stretch/extend its mouth over the entire side in a circle and it makes a “tent” over the hollow/cavity of the utensil but even though he made a “tent,” it is permissible on Jewish holy days, for Rabbi Eliezer holds that acts preliminary to the preparation of food where it is possible to do them from the eve of the Jewish holy day, it is permitted to do them on the Jewish holy day, but on the Sabbath, ab initio, he may not suspend [a strainer] , but if it is [already] suspended, he may place into it the sediments, and stretch it for this is not the manner of "בורר"/sifting (which is one of the primary forms of labor prohibited on the Sabbath).
אין תולין את המשמרת - for he is making a temporary tent and it appears like an act of the weekdays.
ואין נותנין לתלויה בשבת – for it is a derivative of "בורר"/sifting or "מרקד" /shaking in the sieve, and the Halakha is according to the Sages.

Mishnah 2

נותנין מים – [the pour water] on the Sabbath on top of the sediment that is placed in the strainer/filter in order that they will dilute them so that the sediment will be clear and that all their wine will flow. Another explanation: on top of the sediment that remains in the barrel, and the water retains the taste of the wine and they release it on the Sabbath and drink it, and there is nothing in this of [the prohibition of] "בורר" /sifting.
את היין – because of the white flour that exists in it.
בסודרין – that are uniquely designed for this and we should not decree lest that he is “pressing out”/ “wringing out,” for they are made for this labor, so that it doesn’t have to be done by hand with a kerchief like a bulrush in the utensil in order the wine will descend down a declivity, so that he will not do it as he would on a weekday.
ובכפיפה מצרית – a basket made of the bands made of palm-bark so that the basket should not be higher than the bottom of the lowest utensil by a handbreadth, so that the tent is not made temporary.
ונותנין ביצה במסננת – that they placed in it mustard to be filtered for it is customary to place a scrambled egg in decaying things and they become whitened and clear through this.
ינומולין – wine, honey and peppers.
לגין – lager than a cup and smaller than a barrel.
הכל לפי האורחין – if he will have many guests, he makes a lot whether on Shabbat, on the Jewish holy day or during the Intermediate Days of the Festival, and the Halakha is according to the first Tanna/teacher that we make wine mixed with honey [and pepper] according to what they want.

Mishnah 3

חלתית – [assa foetida]. This is its name in Arabic, and it is hot and it is the custom to eat it in cold places, and we do not dissolve it [the resin of assa foetida] on the Sabbath because it appears like an act of the weekdays.
את הכרשינין – pour water in a utensil to separate their refuse , for the refuse floats to the top.
ולא שפין אותן – by hand to remove their refuse for this is "בורר"/sifting.
אבל נותן לתוך הכברה – and even though their refuse falls sometimes through the holes of the sieve and it becomes selected on its own.
התבן – that they would make from the straw/stubble and they would cut it with a threshing sledge and each tail of the ears of corn would be made into straw.
מוץ – this is old upper ears of corn/spike and it is not fit for an animal’s eating and we sift it in a sieve so that the chaff will fall.
אבל נוטל בכברה ונותן לתוך האבוס – and even though the chaff falls on its own, since it is a thing that one doesn’t intend to happen, it is permissible according to Rabbi Shimon.

Mishnah 4

גורפין – on the Sabbath, the feeding receptacle/manger that is in front of the ox, we fatten it so that it will not become combined with the sandy matter in the grain that is in the manger in the straw and barley that we place before him and he will cut himself in his food and we remove the straw that is before him to the sides when there is a lot of it so that the animal will not tread on it with his foot and become dirty from the excrement.
וחכמים אוסרים – it refers to both – cleaning out the manger and the straw that is in front of him (i.e., the animal), he should not sweep it to the sides but Rabbi Sosa and the Sages only argued with regard to the real manger (see Talmud Shabbat 140b in Rashi – as opposed to a piece of ground fenced in and used as a manger/אבוס של קרקע ). But a piece of ground that is fenced in and used as a manger, all agree that we do not clean it out, lest one make indentations/holes, , but the Rabbis decreed that a real manger is just like a piece of ground that is fenced in and used as a manger. But the Halakha is according to the Sages.
נוטלים מלפני בהמה זו ונותנין לפני זו – and we don’t say that it does not appear like carrying , because it really appears like it, because an animal is not set aside with food that is taken from its fellow [animal]. And specifically, from before a donkey and we place it (i.e., the food) before a ox, and similarly to it, but not something that is before the ox and placing it before the donkey, for the food of an ox is detestable with the spittle that comes out of its mouth, and the donkey will not eat of it.

Mishnah 5

הקש שעל מטה – merely for kindling and it is Muktzeh/something set aside/designated for weekday use only and when he comes to lie on it and moves it about in order to be soft and looks to lie on it.
לא ינענענו בידיו – for it is Muktzeh but he may move it with his body [or] his shoulders, for it is carrying from the side, and it is not called carrying.
או שהיה עליו כר או סדין – for he revealed his intention that he set it aside for sleeping so from now it has the status of a utensil.
מכבש – two boards that they place the clothes between them after laundering them and they fasten the upper board on the clothing that are lying on the lower board, in order that they fold nicely.
מתירין – that is for the needs of the Sabbath to take the clothing, but we do not press/tighten them for that is a need of the weekdays.
ושל כובסים לא יגע בו – because it is made to repair clothing and fasten them more , and loosening them is similar to tearing down/destroying and the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Yehuda..

Chapter 21



Mishnah 1

נוטל אדם את בנו – in the courtyard and the stone is in his hand, but we don’t say that he is carrying regarding the stone.
כלכלה – basket
והאבן בתוכה – and it is the case that there will be fruit/produce in the basket, for if there were no fruit in it, it would be made the basis for a prohibited thing for it is prohibited to carry it, and there needs also that there would be in it fruit so that if he casts them on the ground, they would be detestable, such as mulberries and grapes and similar things, but if there were no fruit in it, such as nuts and almonds, he would empty the fruit and they would fall, but the detestable fruit also such as mulberries and grapes, if it is possible to remove them to the sides of the basket and to remove the stone alone, and to cast it away, for it is prohibited to carry it with the stone. But our Mishnah is speaking about the case where it had broken through from the sides of the basket or its rim at the bottom of the vessel and the stone was a wall to it, that it is impossible to use the basket without [the presence] of the stone.
תרומה טמאה עם הטהורה ועם החולין – subsidiary to the pure produce and subsidiary to the non-holy produce but the unclean is separate and is not carried.
אף מעלין את המדומע באחד ומאה – A Se’ah of Terumah/priest’s due that fell into one-hundred Se’ah of non-holy produce, it is permissible to raise it up to a Se’ah of Terumah from them on Shabbat and all of it (i.e., the rest) would be non-holy produce, and it is permissible for foreigners (i.e., non-priests) and we don’t say that he is making things legally fit for use by giving the priest’s dues, for the Terumah that fell in the non-holy produce, we consider it as if it was placed alone, and didn’t become mixed up, and when it comes up as one-part in one-hundred and one, the Terumah itself that fell comes up. Therefore, it is not repairing, but the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Yehuda.

Mishnah 2

מטה על צדה – incline the barrel on its side if it is necessary to take from the wine and stone falls, but he he should not take it with his hands.
היתה בין החביות – and he is afraid that the stone won’t fall on the barrels and break them, he should lift the entire barrel and remove it from among the barrels and there tilt/incline it on its side.
נוער את הכר והן נופלות – when he needs the cushion, but he doesn’t need the place of the cushion. But if he needs its place, he lifts the cushion with the coins that are upon them, and we don’t say other than that other than when he forgot the coins on the cushion from the Eve of the Sabbath but he intentionally placed them there, the cushion becomes the basis for a prohibited thing and it is prohibited to carry it nor to shake the coins that are upon it.
לשלשת – a matter of filth such as spittle, secretion or excrement.
בסמרטוט מקנחת – but he should not put water upon it, for a mere cushion is of cloth and cloth is soaked in water which is its cleansing/washing.
היתה – on the cushion.
של עור – which is not washed/cleansed – he puts waster upon it until it (i.e., the dirt) is gone and the secretion goes away, but no actual cleansing, for since mere cushions and pillow cases are soft and require cleanings with soft leathers; but however, soaking is their cleansing.

Mishnah 3

ב"ש אומרים מגביהין מעל השלחן עצמות וקליפין – In the Gemara (See Talmud Shabbat 143a) that we do not rely upon our Mishnah as it is taught but the statements must be reversed (i.e., the authorities for the two opinions must be exchanged) for it is the School of Hillel that states that we take up [on the Sabbath] table bones and shells and the School of Shammai that states that one removes the whole board and shakes it, for it has the status of a utensil, but he should not carry the bones and shells by hand, for the School of Hillel is like Rabbi Shimon and the School of Shammai is like Rabbi Yehuda. But, however, the School of Hillel did not permit other than the bones and shells that are fit for the food for an animal, even though they are not fit for the food of a person, but if they are not fit even for food for an animal, the School of Hillel admits that it is prohibited to carry them , for in such a manner even Rabbi Shimon admits to.
מעבירין מעל השלחן פרורין פחות מכזית – even less than an olive’s bulk and the reason is as it is explained shortly that they are fit for the food of cattle.
ושער של פולין – a twig that the beans grow on them.
עור בית אחיזה – a leather handle that one holds onto.
אין מקנחין בו – for when he holds it, it is pressed out/flows between his fingers and there is an unavoidable result of an act that Rabbi Shimon admits to.
בין כך ובין כך – whether or not it has a handle it is taken on Shabbat when it is dry.
ואינו מקבל טומאה – it is not a wooden utensil nor a cloth/garment nor a sack nor metal.

Chapter 22



Mishnah 1

לכם – food for everyone for three [Sabbath] meals.
ובלבד שלא יספוג – that he should not place a sponge to absorb the wine and to go back and to cause it to drip and even though one must sponge the handle, for there is no fear of a wringing/squeezing out they were brought iin, even to take in his hand oil or honey which are thick and are affixed and clean his hand on the rim of the utensil, it is prohibited that he do so in the manner that he does it on weekdays.

אסורין – a decree lest he squeeze it out/wring it ab initio.
ר"י אומר אם לאוכלין – those same fruits were collected that which comes out from them is permitted, for it is not satisfactory for him with what flowed out and we cannot make a decree lest he wring them out/squeeze them.
ואם למשקין – they were collected for it was satisfactory for him what came out from them – that which comes out from them is prohibited as a decree lest he squeeze them, and with olives and grapes, Rabbi Yehuda agrees with the Sages that even though he brought them in to eat, that which comes out from them is prohibited since they exist for squeezing when they come to a drink, he would give his attention to this, but in regard to the rest of the kinds of fruits, the Sages agree with Rabbi Yehuda, since it was not the manner for squeezing, they didn’t dispute other than with mulberries and pomegranates, for Rabbi Yehuda compares them to the rest of the priests and the Sages compare them to olives and grapes, and the Halakha is according to Rabbi Yehuda.
חלות דבש – when they are crushed/chopped, the honey flows on its own from the midst of the wax and it is not the manner to squeeze/wring it; therefore, Rabbi Eliezer permits it and the Sages forbid it, as a decree lest they are chopped/crushed; but the Halakha is according to Rabbi Eliezer.

ממרח – and there is here because of erasing/blotting out.
בערב – the name of a place.

ואת המים היפים – that is fit for drinking.
ברעים – within the collection of bad waters which are not fit for drinking, and this is a simple matter, for on account the of the end of the Mishnah, he (i.e., the teacher of the Mishnah) took it, as it is taught in the Mishnah: “and cold water into hot water in order that it should become warm” for you might have thought that we would have made a decree lest we come to hide it in hot ashes; hence it comes to tell you that this is not the case.
מי שנשרו [כליו] – that fell in the water on the Sabbath.
מהלך עמהן ואינו חושש – lest they should suspect hm that he laundered them.
הגיע לחצר החיצונה – that is near the entrance of the sit which is a guarded place.
שוטחן בחמה – to dry them.
אבל לא כנגד העם – for they would suspect him that he laundered them, but this Mishnah is superseded/made inoperative, since the Halakha in our hands is that anything that the Sages forbade because of avoiding the semblance of wrong-doing (i.e., for appearance sake – see Talmud Betzah 9a), even in the strictest privacy, it is forbidden; therefore, it is forbidden to spread them out even not in the view of other people.

Mishnah 5

אלונטיות – sheets that we cleanse with them and dry off with them one after another even though there is not a lot of water on them, nevertheless, he should not he should not bring them in his hand into his house, even through an Eruv, for there is no prohibition of taking it out here but rather a decree lest he wring it out/squeeze it since they are many.

פניהם ידיהם ורגליהם – it the manner of the thing that the Mishnah took [in using these terms] and the same law applies for their entire body.

אפקטויזין – to vomit; and its explanation (see Talmud Shabbat 123a-b) is to cause to bring up roast to nourish, that is to say, to take out the food from the place it is cooked which is the stomach, it emits [and] removes roasted that is cooked, roasted by fire, which we translate as roasted by fire food and specifically to drink a liquid that he brings into him to vomit – which is prohibited on the Sabbath, but to place one’s finger into his mouth in order to vomit is permitted and where he has pain and if he vomits, he will recover, it is permissible even through liquids.
ואין מעצבין את הקטן – to repair him and to settle his bones and vertebra of his spinal column because it appears like “building,” (i.e., one of the prohibited forms of work on the Sabbath), and we don’t say so other than after the time, but it is permitted on the day of birth. מעצבין – from the language (Job 10:8): “Your hands have shaped and fashioned me.”
ואין מחזירין את השבר – the bone that was broken, but the Halakha is not according to this Mishnah but the Halakha is that we do set a fractured bone.
שנפרקה ידו – that the bone went out from its joint.
לא יטרפם – like the language of scrambled eggs in a bowl, and they wash them in [cold] water on the place of the break and it appears like healing.

Chapter 23



Mishnah 1

שואל. ובלבד שלא יאמר הלוני – for it implies a loan for a long time and we hold that an undefined loan is for thirty days; therefore the lender comes to write on his writing tablet/merchant’s account book that I have loaned such-and-such to so-and-so in order that he would not forget it.
מניח טליתו אצלו – if he (i.e., the lender) doesn’t believe him (i.e., the borrower) and he takes it and dedicates it as Temple property on the Sabbath for [loan[ obligations that have a fixed time [for return] one can dedicate [them] on the Sabbath (though we learn in Tractate Arakhin, Chapter 7, Mishnah 5, that one does not dedicate to the Temple something that is not his).

Mishnah 2

פרפרותיו – kinds of dainties/sweets.
אבל לא מן הכתב – if he wrote it from the Eve of the Sabbath (i.e., Friday): “so-and-so are guests” so that he would not forget, he should not read from the same document on the Sabbath, as a preventive measure lest he erase it; alternatively, lest he read private (not Hebrew) documents for it is prohibited to read anything on Shabbat other than the Written Torah and the Oral Torah, but other things or works of scholars that are not from the words of the prophets or their commentaries are forbidden (see Tractate Shabbat 149a).

עם בניו ועם בני ביתו – for they are dependent upon his table for there is no legal objection, but with others one cannot [do so], for members of the group that are strict with each other for they do not pardon and do not renounce each other, violate this because of the measurement and the weight and the number because they loan and collect and the Rabbis decreed on this lest they write it down.
ובלבד שלא יתכוין וכו' – Our Mishnah is deficient, and should be read as follows: a person may conduct a lottery with his children and with the members of his household [dependent] upon his table and even a large portion corresponding to a small portion and specifically with his children and the members of his household, but not with others, provided that he does not intend to make a large portion correspond with a small portion, which is forbidden even on weekdays because dice-playing is theft and collateral security with the condition of forfeiture beyond the amount to be secured does not purchase/gives no title and this is a collateral security with the condition of forfeiture beyond the amount to be secured that is dependent upon the lottery if the lottery will fall to him on the large portion, he will be worthy of it, and therefore, he has left himself in doubt even for a lottery for a small portion through doubt , for had he known from the outset that this would be the case, he would not have accepted it.
חלשים – lotteries such as (Isaiah 14:12): “A vanquisher of nations.”
על הקדשים ביום טוב – that were slaughtered on Yom Tov/the Festival Day to distribute/divide them among the Kohanim.

Mishnah 3

לא ישכור אדם פועלים – as it is written (Isaiah 58:13): “Nor look to your affairs, nor strike bargains.”
ולא יאמר אדם לחבירו וכו' – it was taken for an implied opinion/deduction that he should not say to his fellow: “hire for us workers,” but he says to him: “that it appears that you will stand with me this eening, that is to say, now it appears that if you come to me when it gets dark, and even though that both of them know that on the condition of hiring him for his work he warns him, since he does not spell out his salary explicitly, it is permitted, for we hold that loud recitation is prohibited, but thinking/fantasizing is permitted (on the Sabbath).
אין מחשיכין על התחם – to draw himself close on the Sabbath to the place within which is it is permitted to move (i.e., the Sabbath limits) until the end of the limit and to make preparations to be ready for work on the exit of the Sabbath there that he will be close to the place of the workers or to the orchard to bring fruit, for everything that is prohibited to do on the Sabbath, it is prohibited to make preparations to be ready for work on the exit of the Sabbath but he can make preparations to be close to go out and guard his fruits for this is something that is permitted to do on the Sabbath to guard/watch his fruits.
ומביא פירות בידו – since the essence of this thinking was not for this.
כלל אמר אבא שאול – He disputes the First Teacher [of our Mishnah] that prohibited all preparations to be ready for work on the exit of the Sabbath, but he doesn’t make a distinction between preparations to be ready for work on the exit of the Sabbath of a commandment and something that is optional, and he comes and states that preparations to be ready for work on the exit of the Sabbath is permitted for just as it is permitted to tell his fellow on the Sabbath that he should be designated to go after dark to bring a coffin and shrouds for the dead person, so too, it is permitted to be make preparations to be ready for work on the exit of the Sabbath in order that he will be designated after dark to bring the coffin and shrouds – and at the end of the Mishnah as it is taught: we can make preparations to be ready for work on the exit of the Sabbath to watch over the affairs of a bride and on the affairs of the dead. This is the opinion of Abba Shaul and the Halakha is according to him.

Chapter 24



Mishnah 1

מי שהחשיך. נותן כיסו לנכרי – while it is still daylight, and even though he is the agent of an Israelite to carry his money-bag on the Sabbath, the Rabbis have established that a person will not restrain himself from defending his property (see Talmud Shabbat 72a), for if they don’t permit him, he will come to carry four cubits in the public domain [on Shabbat].
ואם אין עמו נכרי כו' – but if he has a heathen with him, he will give it to the heathen. What is the reason? A donkey, you are commanded to let his animals rest; but a heathen, you are not commanded to let him rest. For when he places his money-bag on the donkey when it gets dark [on Friday], he leaves it on her while she is walking, that is to say, after she has uprooted her leg to walk, she has not performed “uprooting” and when the animal wishes to stand, he takes it from upon her, but after she resumes and uproots her leg to walk, he places it upon her, in order that the animal not perform uprooting and placing down, for if he left her to perform uprooting and placing down, and he loads her or leads her, it is found that he is loading his animal on Shabbat and that is prohibited even though she is not loaded other than with something [minimal] , as it is written (Exodus 20:10): “You shall not do [any] work, you, [your son or daughter, your male or female slave,] or your cattle…” What is the work that is done whether by a person or the animal? One could say that it is loading/piling on.

פקיעי עמיר – straw of ears of corn that were tied together, we loosen them, for all the while that they are tied together they are not food/eatables, and we loosen them to make them into food, but we spread them to scatter them in the manner that we scatter grasses before the animal in order that it would smell it their scent and it would be nice for her to consume them, but it is prohibited with bundles of sheaves, for after they have made it into food, they untying bundles/bunch and the that which is spread, it is not other than for mere enjoyment, but he is troubling himself with something that is already food, we don’t trouble ourselves with it.
ומפספסים את הכיפים – moist cedar branches we spread out and stretch them in front of the animal in order that it would smell their scent for without spreading them out, they are not food.
אבל לא את הזירין – they are bundles of sheaves but these bundles have two ties, one at their head and another at their end, but the small bunches/capsules have three bands (see Talmud Shabbat 155a) - one additional connection in their middle and our Mishnah mentions it for we do not spread these bundles of sheaves, even though they are pressed against each other and become heated, for the animals set them aside but rather, he loosens three bunches only, for the loosening of the bands is a burden for her and the food is like bunches [when tied with two bands].

After that, it is was necessary to open the window and ot take that stopped up pitcher in the window and they came to know if there was in that slit of the barrel an opening of a handbreadth, and if there wasn’t a tent in that passageway to bring in the ritual defilement. For the ritual defilement goes out from the passageway via the slit in the barrel towards above, or if the slit in the barrel is not open one handbreadth, and it was found that the passageway itself was like a tent and brought the ritual defilement from one house to the other. And they measured the earthenware fire pot/potsherd for carrying fire and tied it with bulrushes and stretched it towards above to see if there was in the slit of the barrel opened a handbreadth or not.
ומדבריהם למדנו שפוקקין וקושרין ומודדין בשבת – as long as it was not a permanent knot, for the measurement would be for a Mitzvah or to practice on what is a decision/instruction.
