Bartenura on Mishnah Berakhot



Chapter 1



Mishnah 1

מאימתי קורין את שמעו בערבית? משעה שהכהנים נכנסים לאכול בתרומתן – Kohanim (Priests) who became defiled and immersed [in the Mikveh/Ritual Bath] are not able to eat of the Terumah/heave offering (2% of a yield that a person initially tithes for a Kohen), until after sunset, which is, (at the time) when the stars appear. And the fact the Mishnah does not teach, “from the time when the stars appear” is an incidental matter, which comes to tell us, that if Kohanim were defiled with an uncleanness whose purification is dependent upon [the offering of] a sacrifice, such as one afflicted with gonorrhea or leprosy – their [form of] atonement does not prevent them from eating the heave offering, as it written (Leviticus 22:7): “As soon as the sun sets, he shall be pure; and afterward he may eat of the sacred donations [for they are his food].” The setting of the sun prevents him from his eating the heave offering, but his atonement [sacrifice] does not prevent him from eating his heave offering.
עד סוף האשמורה הראשונה – The first third of the night (is the end of the first “watch”), as the night is divided into three watches, and from then onwards is no longer called the time [for the] Recitation of the Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4-9; 11:13-21; Numbers 15:37-41) when lying down, and we do not refer to it as “when you lie down” (Deuteronomy 6:7), and prior to the stars coming out (literally, “going out”), it is also considered daytime and not the time of lying down. And those who recite Evening Shema early while it is still day, rely upon that [opinion] of Rabbi Yehuda who said further on in Chapter “Tefillat HaShahar”/The Morning Prayer/Amidah (Chapter 4 of Berakhot, Mishnah 1), that the Afternoon prayer is recited until “Plag HaMinhah”/the middle of the afternoon (the half-way point between the time when the Tamid/Daily Sacrifice was offered – 3:30 pm and 6:00 pm when the time of sunset arrives at the Vernal and Autumnal Equinoxes), which is an hour and a quarter prior to the night time. And we establish (literally, “hold”), that he followed [the opinion of] Rabbi Yehudah, and immediately when the time for Minhah ends, the time for the Evening Recitation of the Shema begins.
עד שיעלה עמוד השחר – Since all night long is called the time for lying down, and the Halakha/law follows [the opinion of] Rabban Gamaliel since the Sages also agree with him, and they [the Sages] did not say, “Until Midnight” (for the recitation of the Evening Shema) other than to distance a person from [the possibility of committing a] sin. However, ab initio, when the time for the recitation of the Evening Shema of our Mishnah arrives, that is, from the time that the stars come out, it is forbidden to eat, and all the more so, to lie down until he recites and the Shema and recites the [Amidah] prayer.
מעשה שבאו בניו מבית המשתה – The sons of Rabban Gamaliel followed the teaching of the Rabbis (regarding the ending time to recite the Evening Shema) who said, “until midnight,” and this is what they said to him: That when the Rabbis are in dispute with you, especially when they say, “until midnight” and not any longer, and [when there is a dispute between] and individual and a majority [view], the law follows the majority [view] (see Mishnah Eduyot, Chapter 1, Mishnah 5) or perhaps (alternatively), The Rabbis [hold] like you thinking and that which states, “until midnight, in order to distance a person from committing a sin,” and he (Rabban Gamaliel) said to the Rabbis that they hold like him, and that which [the Mishnah] states “until Midnight” in order to distance a person from [committing] a sin and you are required to recite the Shema [now].
ולא זו בלבד– It is entirely the words of Rabban Gamaliel which he said to his sons.
הקטר חלבים – of the Temple sacrifices.
ואברים – [the limbs of] the burnt offering sacrifice offered daily at even-time in which its blood is cast on the day he is commanded to offer up the pieces all night long, as it written (Leviticus 6:2): “The burnt offering itself shall remain where it is burned upon the altar all night [until morning]…”
וכל הנאכלים ליום אחד – such as the thanksgiving offering, and the sin offering and the guilt offering and others like them, which are eaten in the daytime, but the nighttime is when they are eaten until the crack of dawn and he is the one who brings remnants [of the sacrifices left over beyond the legal time and bound to be burnt].
אם כן למה אמרו חכמים עד חצות – Regarding the Recitation of the [Evening] Shema and the eating of the Holy Things, but concerning the burning of the fats and limbs on the altar, the Sages did not say regarding it “until midnight” at all and [the Mishnah] did not hold this tradition other than to inform [us] that any Mitzvah which is to be performed at night is appropriate to be performed all night long (see Mishnah Megillah, Chapter 2, Mishnah 6).
כדי להרחיק את האדם מן העבירה – [Concerning the fats and limbs ]that he should not come to eat them after the crack of dawn and be liable for extirpation, and similarly regarding the Recitation of the Shema, that he shouldn’t say, “I still have time” and the time period would pass.

Mishnah 2

בין תכלת ללבן – Between the threads of azure and the threads of white in the ritual fringes (of the Tallit. The Torah – Numbers 15:38 – commands that a “cord of blue” be attached to the fringe at each corner; these two colors – blue/azure and white – are sufficiently distinct from each other that one can with relative ease distinguish between people and objects). Another explanation: The sheering of wool whose color is azure/blue and (yet) there are places (in the wool) where the color was not absorbed [properly] and which remained white.
בין תכלת לכרתי – The color of the azure/blue is close to/resembles the color “leek-green” which is called “PORUSH” in a foreign language.
עד שלש שעות – In the day until the conclusion of the third hour, which is one-quarter of the day, at the time when [the length of] the days and the nights are equal. And always, the time for the Recitation of the [Morning] Shema is until the [end of the] first quarter of the day, whether the [length of the] days are long or short. And similarly, that which is taught [in the Mishnah] further on [in the fourth chapter of Berakhot, Mishnah 1], Tefillat HaShahar/The Amidah of the Morning Service is [recited] until the fourth hour of the day that is until one-third of the day, and the “four hours” that was used [by the Mishnah] is because it is one-third of the day – four hours at occasion when the [hours of] daylight and the [hours of] night time are equal. And every place in the Mishnah where it is mentioned “such and such hours” in the day – by this manner you must consider and adjudicate. This I understood from the commentaries of Maimonides that I have received. And the reason of Rabbi Yehoshua [ben Hananiah] who said, “until the third hour of the day” (Mishna Berakhot 4:1), is that it was the practice of royalty who did not rise from their beds until the end of the third hour [of the day], for as the All-Merciful One (God) who stated (Deuteronomy 6:7), “and when you get up”, until the time when all people get up from their beds, it is stated. And the Halakha/law is according to Rabbi Yehoshua. However, ab initio, one must have the intention to recite the [Morning] Shema with sunrise like the conscientious pious ones of former days would do.
לא הפסיד – that is to say, they did not lose out from reciting [the blessings] before and after [the Shema] but even though the time had passed [for its recitation], he recites [the Shema] and the blessings before it and after it.
כאדם הקרוא בתורה – Even though he did not fulfill his religious obligation of reciting the Shema at its appropriate time, he does receive the reward as one who reads [these verses] from the Torah.

Mishnah 3

יטו – [they should lean] on their sides as it is written (Deuteronomy 6:7), “when you lie down” – in the manner of lying down.
יעמדו – [the should stand] – as it is written (Deuteronomy 6:7), “and when you get up” – in the manner of rising.
כדרכו – whether [one is] standing or [one is] sitting or [one is] lying or [one is] walking.
כדי היית – you would have been liable to have been killed and if you had died, you would have been liable for [the loss of] your life.

Mishnah 4

שתים לפניה – [The two blessings before the recitation of the Shema] – “who creates light”/יוצר אור and “love” [i.e “with great love, You, O LORD have loved us”/אהבה רבה]
ואחת לאחריה – [The blessing] “True and established/אמת ויציב”
ובערב – [And in the evening] one recites [the blessing(s)]
שתים לפניה – “One brings on the evening twilight/המעריב ערבים” and “With eternal love/אהבת עולם”. 
And two afterwards – “True and Certain/אמת ואמונה” and “Cause us to lie down/השכיבנו.”
אחת ארוכה ואחת קצרה – Referring to the two [blessings recited] before the Shema, יוצא אור/”Who Forms light” is a “long” [blessing], in that it opens [with the words] “Praised [are You]” and concludes with “Praised [are You]” and similarly [with the blessing in the Evening service] “Who brings on the evening twilight” [which begins with “Praised are You” and concludes with “Praised are You”]. The blessing “Love” (“With great love” – and its evening equivalent “With eternal love”) is short as it concludes with “Praised [are You]” and does not open with “Praised [are You].”
לחתום – with [the word] “Praised [are You, O LORD].”
שלא לחתום – such as the blessings for fruits and blessing for the commandments.

Mishnah 5

מזכירין יציאת מצרים בלילות – The section of Tzizit (Ritual Fringes – the third paragraph of the Shema: Numbers 15:37-41) is said during the Recitation of the Shema at night, and even though the night time is not the time [for the wearing of] Tzizit, as it says, “look at it (and recall all the commandments of the LORD and observe them…)” to the exclusion of nighttime clothing, we recite it (Numbers 15:37-41) at night because of [the mention of] the Exodus of Egypt which is in it.
כבן שבעים שנה – as I appeared old and not actually old, but because [the locks of] his hair had turned white on the day when he was appointed to be the Nasi/head of [the Sanhedrin] in order that he would look “old” and appropriate for the “presidency.” And on that self-same day, Ben Zoma expounded upon this Biblical verse.
ולא זכיתי – I did not win the Sages, and similar to this in the Talmud [is the episode] found in the chapter “B’not Kuttim” (chapter four of Tractate Niddah 38b), in that Rabbi Eleazar defeated the Rabbis, that is to say, he won out against them.

Chapter 2



Mishnah 1

היה קורא בתורה – The portion(s) of the Shema (i.e. Deuteronomy 6:4-9; Deuteronomy 11:13-21 and/or Numbers 15:37-41) [from the Torah scroll].
והגיע זמן – [the time for the] recitation of the Shema [had arrived].
אם כיון לבו יצא – According the words of [the opinion] which states: [The performance of] the commandments requires spiritual intentionality, one must explain if he indeed intended that to fulfill his religious obligation . [And according to the opinion] which states that [the performance of] the commandments does not require spiritual intentionality, he explains – if he intended to read as it is properly pronounced and according to Jewish law, excluding someone who reads to correct/amend the text – who is not reading the words as they are pronounced, but rather reading them as they are written to understand those things which are missing or additional, for in such a reading, one does not fulfill one’s religious obligation. And we hold like the opinion that teaches that [the performance of] the commandments requires religious intentionality (see Tractate Rosh Hashanah, Chapter 3, Mishnah 7 concerning the sounding of the Shofar on Rosh Hashanah and the reading of Megillat Esther on Purim which also deals with the question of “spiritual intentionality”).
בפרקים –Further on, our Mishnah will explain what is meant by the term הפרקים/intervals.
שואל מפני הכבוד – Ask of the welfare of someone who is honored and [for whom] it is appropriate to extend a greeting [first] – such as one’s father or one’s teacher or someone’s whose wisdom is greater than yours.
ומשיב – And we do not have to say [that he may respond] to them if they greet you first.
ובאמצע – [in the middle] of the chapter/section.
שואל מפני היראה – A person whom one fears lest he may kill you, and surely you don’t have to say, that you may respond to a greeting [from him] but not out of one’s honor for that individual.
רבי יהודה אומר באמצע – In the middle of the chapter/section, one may ask of the welfare of someone one fears, and respond peacefully to anyone whom one must [demonstrate] honor/respect.
ומשיב שלום לכל אדם – If he greeted you first, and the law follows like Rabbi Yehuda and in all matters where it is prohibited to interrupt, so it Is also forbidden to speak in Hebrew as it would be in other languages.

Mishnah 2

בין ויאמר לאמת ויציב לא יפסיק – As it is written, “But the LORD is truly God.” (Jeremiah 10:10). Therefore, we do not interrupt between [the words] “I the LORD your God” (Numbers 15:41) and “truth” and this is the Halakha.
והיה אם שמוע נוהג בין ביום ובין בלילה – As it is written (Deuteronomy 11:19), “and teach them to your children” and the study of Torah is practiced both during the daytime and during the nighttime.
ויאמר אינו נוהג אלא ביום – which includes the portion of the Ritual Fringes/Tzizit (Numbers 15:37-41) which are not observed at night, as I states (Numbers 15:39), “look at it.”

Mishnah 3

רבי יוסי אומר: לא יצא – As it is written (Deuteronomy 6:4): “Hear” – Cause your ear to hear what your mouth utters. And the first teacher [of our Mishnah] holds that “Shema” is recited in any language that you hear, and the Halakha follows this first teacher.
ולא דקדק באותיותיה – To emit them with one’s lips clearly – so that two words where the first letter of the second word begins with the same letter that concluded the first word – such as “Al L’va’vekha” (Deuteronomy 6:6 – “Take to heart”) עשב בשדך” (Deuteronomy 11:15 – “I will provide grass in the fields”), ועבדתם מהרה"” (Deuteronomy 11:17 – “and you will soon perish”) - that if you do not place a space between [these words] to separate them, you will end up reading these two (identicaletters as one letter.
רבי יוסי אומר – And the Halakha is like Rabbi Yosi. However, ab initio, one must take care to be exacting in pronouncing the letters of the words (of the Shema) and similarly, one should be careful not (concerning the usage of the SHWA), to make a moving SHWA a resting one or a resting one a moving one, nor to make a strong DAGESH of something which is soft or a soft DAGESH of something that is strong. And one must articulate clearly the ZAYIN of the word “תזכרו” (Numbers 15:40 –“Thus you will be reminded”) so that it does appear as if one is saying, “תשכרו” (to be rewarded), with the letter SIN, to say, that you should receive great reward [for the performance of the commandments] – for it is inappropriate (see Tractate Avot, Chapter 1, Mishnah 3) “to serve the master [i.e. God] in order to receive a reward.”
הקורא למפרע – Recite the third verse before he second and the second before the first, and other similarities.
לא יצא – As it is written (Deuteronomy 6:6), “these instructions [which I charge you this day],” as they are, that is to say, as they are organized in the Torah. But however, if one first read the "ויאמר" passage (Numbers 15:37-41) prior to the והיה אם שמוע"” passage (Deuteronomy 11:13-21), or the “והיה אם שמוע” passage prior to “שמע” (Deuteronomy 6:4-9), it would appear that it is not important read out of order, and one fulfills [one’s obligation] since they are not set up that way, one after the other in the Torah.
יחזור למקום שטעה – If between each section [of the Shema] he erred and did not know on which section he had interrupted (the appropriate order), and to which paragraph’s beginning he should return to, he should go back to the first interval – which is “והיה אם שמוע” (Deuteronomy 11:13-21). And Maimonides states that this is the first sentence: “ואהבת את ה' אלהיך” (Deuteronomy 6:5), and if he is in the middle of a section, he should stop [assuming that] he knows which section (of the Shema) that he is in, but if he doesn’t know which place and from which section he is in, he should stop and return to the beginning of that section. If he was reciting: “וכתבתם [על מזוזות]” and did not know if it was referring did not know if it was referring to “and you shall inscribe them” from the first section of the Shema (Deuteronomy 6:9) or the second section of the Shema (Deuteronomy 11:20), he should go back to the first mention of “you shall inscribe them” (Deuteronomy 6:9). But if he became doubtful after he had begun (the concluding verse of the second section of the Shema), “to the end that you and your children may endure” (Deuteronomy 11:21), he should not go back, since he is following the natural flow of the language [of the Shema].

Mishnah 4

נדבך – a layer of stones of a building such as “a course of unused timber for each three courses of hewn stone” (Ezra 6:4), and even though he is fearful that he might fall, and would not be able to focus (“have spiritual intentionality” during his recitation of the Shema) , the Sages did not require him to come down, for the Recitation of the Shema only requires spiritual intentionality for the first verse only (“Hear O Israel, the LORD our God, the LORD is One”).
מה שאינן רשאין לעשות כן בתפילה – for Prayer (the Recitation of the Amidah) is [a plea for] mercy and requires spiritual intentionality. Therefore, one descends (from above) and prays (recites the Amidah).

Mishnah 5

חתן – [A groom] who married a virgin 
פטור מקריאת שמע לילה ראשון – is exempt from the Recitation of the Shema the first night (of his marriage) because of the grave concern that he might not find her to be a virgin. And I heard that he fears lest he might his genitals might be mutilated through his [initial] intercourse [with his wife] and it is his preoccupation with this Mitzvah. And All-Merciful One (God) said (Deuteronomy 6:7), “and when you are away” – in your “going” (the commandment for sexual intercourse with one’s [virgin] wife is tied to the command “be fertile and increase” – Genesis 1:27) – which obligates you but also commands one’s exemption [from the recitation of the Shema].
אם לא עשה מעשה – If he did not engage in sexual intercourse until Saturday night (after the conclusion of Shabbat) which is four nights that he was preoccupied [with his ability to perform his sexual obligations to his wife]. And from that point onwards, he becomes intimate with her and furthermore, is no longer preoccupied, and even though he has not yet performed his obligation [of intimacy with his wife], he is obligated to recite the Shema.

Mishnah 6

רחץ לילה הראשון שמתה אשתו – And even though a mourner (during Shivah) is prohibited from bathing.
אסטניס אני – Cold and frost – from the word “tzinah”/cold – and it would cause pain/suffering if he would not wash and it is only forbidden during the days of his mourning to bathe for pleasure (i.e. swimming, lengthy hot shower).

Mishnah 7



Mishnah 8

לא כל הרוצה ליטול את השם יטול – If he is not considered a Sage and someone distinguished in other things, it would only be considered as excessive pride if he would attempt to show that he can demonstrate spiritual intentionality. And the Halakha does not follow Rabban Gamaliel. And we see that some of our Rabbis who say that nowadays, any person can recite the Shema on the first night (following their wedding) since in these generations, there is not that much spiritual intention on the other days and if he didn’t recite [the Shema] on the first night (following his wedding), it would appear like a greater haughtiness if he is able [to recite the Shema] with spiritual intentionality, in every hour other than now, because of his concern of fulfilling the Mitzvah of “being fruitful and multiplying.”

Chapter 3



Mishnah 1

מי שמתו מוטל לפניו – One of the relatives that is obligated to observe mourning rituals on them when [one’s dead relative] is lying before him for burial.
פטור מקריאת שמע – because he is too preoccupied with the Mitzvah [of burial].
וחילופיהן – since it is the practice that people switch off because everyone wants to have the merit of [participating in ] the Mitzvah of [accompanying the dead].
את שלפני המטה – those whom are invited to carry [the bier] when the bier arrives near them [on the way to the cemetery].
את שלאחר המטה – that is to say, whether [we are referring to] those who are in front of the bier or those who are behind the bier, if the bier is in need of them to help carry it, they are exempt [from reciting the Morning Shema].
ואת שאין המטה צריך בהם – such as those who walk to accompany the deceased to merely honor him/her, are required [to recite the Shema].
אלו ואלו פטורים מן התפילה – Since it (the recitation of the Amidah)is not mandated by the Torah like the Recitation of the Shema, and there are those who say because it (the recitation of the Amidah) requires greater spiritual intention.

Mishnah 2

להתחיל ולגמור – the first paragraph of the Recitation of the Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4-9).
לשורה – that they would make row upon row [of comforters] surrounding the mourner to comfort him when returning from the grave.
ואם לאו – that the path from the graveside until the place when they make the rows [of condolence for the mourner] and there is no time to begin and complete [the recitation of the Shema] until they would arrive at the rows [of condolence].
הפנימים – those who can see the mourners.
וחיצונים – those who cannot see the faces of the mourners.

Mishnah 3

נשים ועבדים פטורים מקריאת שמע – Even though it is a “positive, time-bound commandment”, and women are exempt from all “positive time-bound commandments,” you may possibly think we say (i.e., you may be misled to interpret) that [women] should be required, since there is [mention concerning the recitation of the Shema of] the “sovereignty of heaven,” it comes to teach us [that women are nevertheless exempt]; for [the wearing of] Tefillin is a “positive time-bound” commandment, but the nighttime and the Sabbath (and Festivals) are not times [for the wearing of Tefillin] and that since there is a juxtaposition between the [commandments of] Tefillin to that of the Mezuzah (which women are obligated to observe -see especially Deuteronomy 6:8-9) that women should be obligated [in the Mitzvah of Tefillin], it comes to teach us that this is not the case.
קטנים – [A minor] who has arrived at the age of where he can be educated, they [the Rabbis] did not place upon his father the obligation to teach him to recite the Shema since he is not always with him at the times when the Shema is recited (morning and evening) and neither with Tefillin since [even] a normal minor does not know how to guard his Tefillin [properly] so that he would not [desecrate the Tefillin] by breaking wind in them.
וחייבין בתפילה – Since Tefillah/prayer [The Amidah] is [a request] for mercy, and it is Rabbinic (as opposed to Biblical in nature), and the Rabbis established that even women [are obligated in Tefillah] and to educate their young in praying.
ובמזוזה – For you might have said that since there is a juxtaposition between it [Mezuzah] and [the commandment to] study Torah (see especially Deuteronomy 11:19-20), that just as women are exempt from [the commandment of] studying Torah, as it is written (Deuteronomy 11:19), “and teach them to your children” – and not your daughters, so also here that they [women] would be exempted from [the commandment of [putting up a] Mezuzah, even though it [the commandment concerning the Mezuzah] is a “positive commandment which is NOT time-bound,” nevertheless, it comes to teach us [that women are required to observe the commandment of Mezuzah].
ובברכת המזון – We must ask if women are obligated [in the recitation of] the Blessing After the Meal/Birkat HaMazon from [the perspective of] the Torah-law, since it is written (Deuteronomy 8:10) “When you have eaten your fill, give thanks to the LORD your God for the good land which He has given you],” this is a “positive commandment that is not time-bound” or possibly, [women] are not Torah-bound obligated to recite the Prayer after the Meal/Birkat HaMazon because it is written (Deuteronomy 8:10), “for the good land which He has given you,” but the land was not given to females, and it has not been [adequately] deduced.

Mishnah 4

בעל קרי – Ezra (444 BCE) decreed that a person who suffered a nocturnal emission/pollution should not read from the Torah, whether he saw the emission as an unavoidable accident or whether it occurred willingly until he immerses himself [in a Mikveh/ritual bath], and not because of [ritual] defilement or ritual purity since the words of the Torah cannot receive defilement but in order that Sages should not be found with their wives like chickens.
מהרהר – He recites the Shema to himself when the time arrives for the recitation of the Shema.
ואינו מברך לפניה ולאחריה – And even meditating to himself since these blessings are not a Torah-requirement (the blessings before and after the Shema), the Rabbis did not require it of him.
ועל המזון מברך לאחריה – Since it is an obligation of the Torah (the recitation of the Blessing following the Meal).
But he does not recite the blessing before, since it is not a Torah-requirement, and the Halakha has already been decided that [the requirement of] immersion has been voided, and those who have had a nocturnal emission recite the Shema in the normal manner and engage in Torah [study] and pray, reciting all the blessings and he should not contest the legality of the matter.

Mishnah 5

לא יפסיק – [He should not interrupt] his prayer completely, but rather shorten each blessing recited.
עד דלא תנץ החמה – Since the ultra-pious ones are exacting upon themselves to complete (the Amidah) with sunrise, as it states (Psalms 72:5), “Let them fear You as long as the sun shines [while the moon lasts, generations on end].”
יתכסה במים – and especially in turbid waters, where he cannot view his virile membrum but not in clear waters.
במים רעים – badly smelling waters
במי משרה – where they steep flax in them
עד שיטיל לתוכן מים – Our Mishnah is elliptical [and is missing something] and this is what should be taught: that he should not recite [the Shema] near urine until he places water in it and the measure of the water that he should place in it [to negate] the urine from one urination would be [the equivalent of] one-fourth of a LOG (1 LOG = 6 eggs in volume).
וכמה ירחיק מהם – [He should distance himself] from the urine so that he did not place in them water and from his defecation.
ארבע אמות – And especially o his sides or in back of him but in front of him, he should distance [himself as far as he can see.

Mishnah 6

זב שראה קרי – Even though that he [who is afflicted with gonorrhea] has made himself impure for seven days because of his gonorrhea, and his immersion [in the Mikveh/ritual bath] does not purify him, nevertheless, he requires immersion according to the words of the Torah, according to the enactment of Ezra , since one who has a nocturnal emission and a menstruant woman , if she came to pray and discharged her seed, she considered to be like one who had a nocturnal emission, as a woman who releases her seed is defiled through her emission for three days after sexual intercourse. And from then onwards, her seed has decayed in her body and its not appropriate of having a fetus created from it. And this is the explanation concerning a menstruant woman who emits her seed during the time of intercourse which she engaged in the previous night before she saw it and when she engages in sex and finds that she is a menstruant woman; after she had engaged in intercourse, she requires ritual immersion.
ורבי יהודה פוטר – Even a woman who engaged in sexual intercourse and saw that she had become a menstruant woman, Rabbi Yehuda exempts, even though ab initio, she should immerse herself, and one can say that her obligation of immersion was prevented. And we have already written above that she did not have to engage in ritual immersion because it was a decree that most of the community could not could not follow.

Chapter 4



Mishnah 1

תפלת השחר עד חצות – Since the morning daily offering is offered until noon, according to the Rabbis, and according to Rabbi Yehuda, is not offered other than up until the fourth hour of the day. “Until the fourth hour” is until the end of the fourth hour which is one-third of the day at the time when the day has twelve [equivalent] hours, and so is its time is forever, until the end of the first third of the day, according to the length or shortness of their daytimes, as we have written above regarding the [recitation of the] Shema. And the Halakha follows Rabbi Yehuda.
תפלת המנחה עד הערב – until it gets dark.
עד פלג המנחה – the time of the “small Minha” which is from nine-and one-half hours [into the day] until the nighttime, which is [the equivalent of] two-and-one-half hours. Hence it is found that “Plag HaMinha” is one half of this measure which is one and one-quarter hours, and that the determined law/practice [in this matter] is that he who followed [the Sages] followed them, and he who followed [Rabbi Yehuda] followed him, and he who wants to follow the words of the Sages and recite the afternoon prayer until the evening should do so, as long as he does not recite the evening prayer at that time, since he considers that daytime period for the matter of reciting the afternoon service, he is not able to consider it nighttime and to recite] the evening service. But, if he comes to act according to the words of Rabbi Yehuda, that he should not recite the afternoon service other than until “Plag HaMinha” (i.e., 4:45 pm), which is an [halakhic] hour-and-a-quarter before the nighttime, he should do so, and from that point onwards, he may recite the evening service.
אין לה קבע – Its time [the evening service] is all night long, but when it [the Mishnah] teaches, “Ein Lah K’vah/It has no fixed time,” and it doesn’t teach, “its time is all night long” – it comes to teach us that the evening service is optional, since it was [considered] parallel to the offering of the limbs and fats which are offered all night, and these are optional, since when the blood is poured, the sacrifice is accepted, even though the limbs and fats were defiled or lost. However, nowadays, it (the recitation of the evening service), has been accepted as obligatory.
ושל מוספין כל היום – But if he recited [Musaf] later after the seventh hour, he has fulfilled his religious obligation, but he is called a sinner, and this is the Halakha.

Mishnah 2

מה מקום – that is to say, what is its nature?
שלא תארע תקלה – that no stumbling block should come through me, as it is explained in the Baraitha: “that I should not stumble in a matter of Halakha and that my colleagues would rejoice [in my being in error],” that evil should come upon me in that I caused them to be punished [through my errant decision].
אני נותן הודיה על חלקי – I express thanks for the good that has been my portion that my I have been placed among those who sit in the House of Study. And these two prayers [recited] when one enters the House of Study and when one leaves it are obligatory upon each and every person to recite them and so we say in the Baraitha – When he enters: What should he say? And when leaves, what should he say? – implying that it is obligatory to recite them [both].

Mishnah 3

מעין שמונה עשרה – There are those explain in the Gemara that a person recites a shortened form of each of the middle blessings in the Amidah and recites the concluding blessing for each one. And there are those who say [the prayer] “הביננו – O Lord our God, Cause Us to Understand [and to] Know Your Ways” which is one blessing which has an abstract of each of the middle blessings of the Shemoneh Esreh and we conclude this with the blessing, “Praised are You, who hearkens to prayer.”
שגורה בפיו – learned and fluent in it. And the Halakha is like Rabbi Akiva – for an individual whose prayer is not fluent in his mouth or is in a hurry , should recite the first three blessings [of the Amidah] and the last three blessings [of the Amidah] and the “הביננו” prayer in the middle , which is an abstract of all the middle [blessings], except for [the Amidah] during the rainy season since a person should not recite הביננו"” because he must mention the “request for rain” [“ותן טל ומטר לטובה – provide dew and rain for a blessing”] in the “blessing of the years” and also except for Saturday evenings and the conclusion of holy days where he needs to recite the Havdalah prayer in the [fourth] blessing, "חונן הדעת" – who grants knowledge.”

Mishnah 4

העושה תפלתו קבע – That his prayer appears to him like a burden, and the word “קבע/fixed” implies that it is like a fixed statute upon me to pray and I have to fulfill it.
מתפלל תפלה קצרה – And what is this short prayer? That he recites: “Save O LORD, your people…”
בכל פרשת העבור – Even at the time when they are turning aside to sin, “may their needs be revealed before You to have compassion upon them.” “פרשת”/crossroads – means “turning aside.” “העיבור”- of the crossroads. But the Halakha does not follow Rabbi Yehoshua, but rather, the prayer that is recited in a place of danger is “The needs of your people are many, etc.” And when a person recites it as he is walking, he does not recite the first three or last blessings [of the Amidah] but when he passes through the place of danger and is able to compose himself at ease, he must go back and recite the Amidah as it has been established if the time for its being recited has not yet passed.

Mishnah 5

היה רוכב על החמור ירד – The Halakha does not follow the [opinion of this] anonymous Mishnah but rather whether or not he has someone who can hold his donkey or not, he should not descend [from it] because his mind is not at ease when he descends [from it].
יחזיר את פניו – [He should turn his face] towards Jerusalem, as it says (I Kings 8:48), “and they pray to You in the direction of their land…”
יכוין את בלו כנגד בית קדשי הקדשים – as it states (I Kings 8:35), “and then they pray towards this place…”

Mishnah 6

באסדא – much wood tied and fastened together on which they float them on the river and people walk upon them, and in the language of the Bible (II Chronicles 2:15), they are called “rafts.”

Mishnah 7

אין תפלת המוספים אלא בחבר עיר – In communities of the city, that is to say, as a tzibbur/congregation and not as an individual.
בחבר עיר ושלא בחבר עיר – whether as a congregation or as an individual.
ר' יהודה אומר משמו – in the name of Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah. There is a difference between the first teacher [of our Mishnah] and Rabbi Yehuda: An individual who dwells in a city where there aren’t ten [individuals – for a Minyan], according to the First Teacher [of our Mishnah] according to the opinion of Rabbi Eleazar who said, that they did not establish this other than with a community of the city, then an individual is exempt. But according to Rabbi Yehuda, an individual is only exempt when he is in a place where ten [individuals are found] and the שליח ציבור/emissary of the congregation exempts him. And the Halakha follows the Sages.

Chapter 5



Mishnah 1

אין עומדין...מתוך כובד ראש – surrender and fear/awe, as it is written (Psalms 2:11), “Serve the LORD in awe;” and this “service” is prayer.
שוהים שעה אחת – at the place where they came to pray.
אפילו המלך שואל בשלומו – and specifically a Jewish king, but a king who worships idols and constellations, you interrupt [yourself] so that he would not kill you.
אפילו נחש כרוך על עקבו – specifically a snake which most of the time does not bite, but a scorpion or a viper from the things that do indeed bite and kill, you interrupt [your recitation of the Amidah].

Mishnah 2

מזכירין גבורות גשמים – The words “Who Causes the Wind to blow” is not the language of a request, but rather the language of mentioning and praise, and because the rains are one of the powers of the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is written (Job 5:9-10), “Who performs great deeds which cannot be fathomed…Who gives rain to the earth” – and because of this, we call it the “גבורות גשמים/the Power to cause the rain to fall.”
ושאלה – [The words] “who causes dew and rain to fall for a blessing” is a request.
בברכת השנים – Since these (in this blessing) are for sustenance, [the Rabbis] established their request in the blessing of sustenance.
והבדלה – on Saturday night (after Shabbat is over)
בחונן הדעת – [Chonen HaDaat] which is the first blessing of the weekday. And in the Jerusalem Talmud, they asked: Why was Havdalah established to be recited in “"חונן הדעת (the fourth blessing of the Amidah)? For if there is no knowledge, how can one know about Havdalah (the ceremony that separates between the conclusion of the Sabbath and the beginning of the workweek)? And this is the Halakha.

Mishnah 3

על קן צפור יגיעו רחמיך – Just as Your mercy reached the bird and you decreed (Deuteronomy 22:6), “Do not take the mother together with her young,” so too should God have compassion upon us as well.
משתקין אותו – [We silence him] for making the Holy One, blessed be He’s attributes ones of mercy, and they are none other than decrees of the King upon his servants.
על טוב יזכר שמך – Implying on Your [God’s] goodness (alone) we give thanks to you, but we do not thank Him [God] on the bad things , and yet we are obligated to bless God on the bad things as we do on the good things (see Tractate Berakhot, chapter 9, Mishnah 5).
מודים מודים – which [when you repeat the word “Modim/We thank you,” it appears like one is accepting upon oneself multiple deities, and the Jerusalem Talmud explains that this when it is recited by the community, whereas for an individual [worshipper], they are [words of] supplication.
ולא יהא סרבן באותה שעה – In the manner of those who descend before the Ark [to lead the service] that they must refuse once, but he should not refuse when they [the members of the congregation] tell him, “go down,” because it is shameful that the Prayer is interrupted so much.

Mishnah 4

לא יענה אחר הכהנים אמן – at the conclusion of each blessing such as the rest of the congregation does (i.e. After the Kohanim, at the prompting of the שליח ציבור/emissary of the congregation, recites each word in Hebrew of – “May the LORD bless you and guard you” – the congregation would answer “Amen.”).
מפני הטירוף – that he (the שליח ציבור/emissary of the congregation) would not be confused and err since the שליח ציבור/emissary of the congregation would need to begin the second blessing and recite it to them (the Kohanim), word by word, and if he would answer “Amen,” (following the completion of the recitation of the blessing by the Kohanim), he would not be able to concentrate and return to his prayer speedily , and to begin the blessing in the appropriate manner that he should begin.
לא ישא את כפיו – Lest he is unable to concentrate and return to his prayer (repetition of the Amidah and to begin “שים שלום/Grant peace” (the concluding blessing of the Amidah), as his mind would be confused due to his fear of the congregation.
ואם הבטחתו – that is if he is self-assured that he won’t become confused from the fear of the congregation.

Mishnah 5

אם שגורה תפלתי – ordered/arranged well in my mouth, that is acceptable and I would not stumble in it.
שהוא מטורף – that the infirm individual would be rejected (bound to die), such as (Genesis 44: 28), “alas, he was torn by a beast. ” Another explanation: it is the language (Tractate Berakhot 5b) of: “his prayer is thrown in his face” (i.e. rejected); that is to say, the prayer that they prayed for him is rejected and troubled and not accepted.

Chapter 6



Mishnah 1

כיצד מברכין...חוץ מן היין – Since out of its importance (i.e., the wine), they (i.e., the Rabbis) established a blessing of its own.
בורא מיני דשאים – Since there is the midst the “fruit of the ground,” herbs and seeds such as pulse and Rabbi Yehuda requires a recognized blessing for each species/kind. But the Halakha does not follow Rabbi Yehuda. But since it teaches in the Mishnah that on vegetables we recite [the blessing] “who creates the fruit of the ground,” these kinds of vegetables where is customary to eat them raw and he ate them raw, or where it was customary to eat them cooked and he ate them cooked. But those [vegetables] where it was customary to eat raw and he ate them cooked, or [conversely], where it was customary to eat them cooked and he ate them raw, , he only recites [upon them] the blessing “שהכל/for all things [created by (God’s) word].” And those vegetables that we eat either raw or cooked, we make the blessing, “who creates the fruit of the ground/בורא פרי האדמה” whether he [ate them] raw or cooked.

Mishnah 2

ברך על פירות האילן וכו' – Whenever one takes hold of fruit that comes from a branch and that branch itself produces fruit in the following year (i.e., “perennial”), it is called a “tee” and we make the blessing on its fruits, “בורא פרי העץ/who creates the fruit of the tree;” but, where one takes hold of it [the fruit] and the branch does not remain to produce in the following year, we do not recite the [same] blessing on them, but rather, “בורא פרי האדמה/who creates the fruit of the ground.”
על כולן אם אמר שהכל יצא – And even on bread and even on the wine (i.e., fruit of the vine). However, ab initio, one should not eat any fruit if he does not know at first the appropriate blessing to be recited on it.

Mishnah 3

נובלות – fruit that fell from the tree prior to being fully ripened.
גובאי (species of edible locusts) – clean/pure locusts
מין קללה – unripe fruit and locusts come from a curse; and the Halakha does not follow Rabbi Yehuda.

Mishnah 4

מין שבע – wheat, barley, vines, figs, pomegranates, olives and dates, which are preferred since through them, the Land of Israel is praised (see Deuteronomy 8:9).
מברך על איזה מהם שירצה – which are beloved to him, and the Halakha follows the Sages.

Mishnah 5

פטר את היין שלאחר המזון – These words [refer to] Sabbaths and Holy Days where it is customary to impart the character of an appointed meal (Sabbath or Holy Day) on the wine after the meal when reciting the blessing on the wine prior to the [start of the] meal, with the assumption that he has already recited the blessing, but on other days where it is not customary to impart the character of an appointed meal through wine after the meal, the blessing on the wine prior to [the start of] the meal does not exempt one [from being required] to recite a blessing after the meal. And every [expression] of “after the meal” as taught in this Tractate is after one has removed their hands from the bread prior to their recitation of the Blessing after the Meal/ברכת המזון.
פרפרת – Everything that serves as a relish for bread such as meat, or eggs or fish is called appetizer/פרפרת; and sometimes they would bring appetizers before the meal/main course, in order to continue the eating and then they once again bring other "פרפרות" after the meal/]dessert] after they have withdrawn their hands from the bread.
מעשה קדרה – Such as flat cakes and grist of early ripened and tender barley which are boiled in water such as pancakes and other similar things. And there are those who explain the word “פרפרת” of our Mishnah as shrunken pieces of bread (soaked) in a bowl which does not appear to look like bread, and on which (when we consume it), we recite the blessing on it, “בורא מיני מזונות/Who Creates various kinds of foods.” And now, it is appropriate that we should teach, “If one has made the blessing on the appetizer, one is not exempt from reciting the blessing on the bread,” even though it also is a form of bread. But something that has been made in a pot exempts us [from reciting the blessing on the bread]. And the School of Shammai holds that just as if we made a blessing on the appetizer, we are not exempt from [reciting the blessing on] the bread, similarly, we are exempt by something made in a pot. And the Halakha does not follow the School of Shammai.

Mishnah 6

היו יושבין – Without reclining and the sign is that they were not gathered to eat together, since it was customary when groups of people gather together to eat, they would recline on couches and eat and drink while leaning to the left.
כל אחד מברך לעצמו – For they did not have an established meal without reclining. However, if they said: “Let us go and eat bread in a certain place,” even though they did not recline, it is as if they had reclined, and one makes the blessing for (i.e. on behalf of) everyone and they join together also for the invitation [to recite ברכת המזון/The Blessing after the Meal].
בא להם מים בתוך המזון כל אחד מברך לעצמו – Since the esophagus is not free, and the hearts of those leaning are not facing the individual who is making the blessing, other than to swallow what is in their mouths. If so, there is concern lest a person choke when he comes to answer “Amen” [to the blessing recited].
והוא אומר על המוגמר – He who recites ברכת המזון/The Blessing After the Meal, he is the one reciting a blessing on the spices on perfume, “who creates the trees of spices/בורא עצי בשמים”, and even though that there is one that is preferable to it, even so, since he began with one, he would move to the other.
לאחר הסעודה – After [reciting] ברכת המזון, that currently is not [connected to] the needs of the meal, even so, since he has begun reciting other blessings, he should finish them.
מוגמר – they were accustomed to bring trees of spices/perfume after the meal snuff-dishes on a fire for the purposes [of providing] a good smell.

Mishnah 7

מליח – every salty thing.
שהפת טפלה לו – Whomever ate a large meal [consisting of] extremely sweet fruits, eats afterwards something salty to sever the moisture that is stuck is attached in his body on account of the large amount of fruits [consumed], and because he is incapable of eating something salty alone, he eats from the bread with it. But the salty [food] alone is essential and the bread is secondary to it.

Mishnah 8

מברך אחריהן שלש ברכות – Anything from the seven species, [after eating] one recites the three blessings [of ברכת המזון] as Rabban Gamaliel holds that [the words] “when you have eaten your fill, give thanks [to the LORD your God” (Deuteronomy 8:10), does not refer to bread alone, but to all seven of the species that are mentioned above in the portion of this verse (ibid., verse 8, “a land of wheat and barley, of vines, figs and pomegranates, a land of olive trees and honey”). And in this verse, the three blessings are hinted at: “give thanks” – this is the blessing for food; “for the…land” – this is the blessing of the Land (of Israel); “for the good [land which He has given you]” – [this is the blessing of] “who builds Jerusalem.” And similarly, he says, “that good hill country and the Lebanon” (Deuteronomy 3:25).
וחכ"א ברכה אחת – [One blessing] that is an abstract of the three blessings; if he ate grapes, figs, pomegranate, olives or dates, he recites the blessing, “on the tree and on the fruit of tree and on the splendid good land, etc.” and concludes the blessing [with the words: Praised are You….] on the Land and on the fruit thereof.” And in the land of Israel, one concludes the blessing: “on the Land and on its fruit.” And this blessing itself he would recite, “on the wine,” but he would open [with the words]: [Praised are You….] on the wine and on the fruit of the vine” (see Berakhot 44a). And on ever thing that is made from the five kinds of grain (i.e., wheat, rye, barley, spelt and oats), he would substitute [the words] “for the sustenance and on the provision” for “on the tree and the fruit of the tree” and conclude [the blessing with the words, “Praised are You…] for the sustenance and on the provision.”
אפילו אכל שלק – [overboiled] vegetables and it is the meal that he depends upon [for nourishment, making a meal of it], he recites the three blessings of “when you have eaten your fill, [give thanks [to the LORD your God] (Deuteronomy 8:10), since it refers to what he has eaten. And the Halakha follows the Sages, that we do not recite the three blessings [of Birkat HaMazon] other than for bread , and on the seven species [of the Land of Israel], we recite the one blessing that is an abstract of the three [ברכה אחת מעין שלש] , but on all other things, we recite “בורא נפשות רבות וחסרונן/Who Creates Many Souls [who have] their Deficiencies/lacking”. And the explanation of the word, “חסרונן”/Deficiencies/that which they are lacking, such as bread and water where it is impossible to exist without them “on everything that [God] created for a living person to exist , that is to say, on everything in the world that also, had it not been created, human beings could exist and everyone was not create for pleasure and additional goodness and because there is this blessing, these two matters are covered in one long blessing that begins with “Praised [are You]” and concludes with “Praised [are You]” as it is found in the Jerusalem Talmud , “Praised are You, O LORD, eternal life of the universe.”
השותה מים לצמאו – Specifically [drinking water to quench one’s thirst], he recites the blessing, “For all things [that will be like God’s word]/שהכל נהיה בדברו".” But if one drinks water in order to swallow [i.e. wash down] some food that is stuck in his throat, he does not recite a blessing.
רבי טרפון אומר בורא נפשות רבות – He recites he blessing before drinking the water, but the Halakha does not follow Rabbi Tarphon, but rather, beforehand, recites “Shehakol” and afterwards, “בורא נפשות רבות”/Who Creates many souls.”

Chapter 7



Mishnah 1

שלשה שאכל כאחד חייבין לזמן – to join oneself to [the group] together to recite [Birkat HaMazon] in the plural [formulation], “let us bless/give thanks for what we had have eaten of His {God’s].”
דמאי – produce of the masses (lit., “ignorant ones”) which are called “DEMAI”/doubtfully tithed, that is to say, this – have they been tithed or not? Since they are suspected regarding the tithes. (Note: Generally, the masses (common people – who are not known as Haverim/colleagues who are considered trustworthy) would give תרומה גדולה– the 2% tithe of their produce to a Kohen, but they might not necessarily give 1/10th of the rest to a Levite- known as מעשר ראשון/First Tithe or take 1/10 of the remainder to Jerusalem in years 1,2,4 and 5 of the seven year cycle to be consumed there- known as מעשר שני/Second Tithe), and the Sages forbade eating from their produce until they would tithe it, and if one ate [from produce] that was not tithed, one recites the [appropriate] blessing on it and it is not considered a Mitzvah performed on account of a sin, since most of the masses do tithe.
שנטלה תרומתו – And even though they may not have taken from it the תרומה גדולה/the Great Tithe (for the Kohen), such as the son of a Levite who took his portion (מעשר ראשון) for them prior to the Kohen taking his תרומה גדולה portion (2% of the entire individual’s produce, and the Kohen who should have taken his תרומה גדולה first [which is] one-fiftieth (1/50), as the All-Merciful (in the Torah) calls it “[the] first [portion]” (see Numbers 15:20); it is found that the תרומה גדולה of the Kohen is amidst this tithe one of fifty, besides the תרומה מעשר that the Levite is obligated to separate out the tithe from his tithe to give to the Kohen (1/10 of his received gift goes to a Kohen), and our Mishnah teaches us that he the Levite is exempt from separate out תרומה גדולה (the “Great Tithe” of 2% that all Israelites must give), as it is written (Numbers 18:26), “you shall set aside from them one-tenth of the tithe as a gift to the LORD.” “One tenth of the tithe” I said to you and not “תרומה גדולה/the Great Tithe”, but one-tenth of the tithe [only].
מעשר שני והקדש שנפדו – Such as the case where he gave the principal but did not give the extra one-fifth, that the owners that fifth, and our Tanna/teacher comes to teach us that the one-fifth does not invalidate an act by its omission.
והשמש שאכל כזית – you might be under the impression that since the waiter/attendant lacks having a regular appointment (i.e., being regularly there), [but simply] comes and goes, that we would not invite him [to recite ברכת המזוןas part of a group], but [the Mishnah] comes to teach us that in all of these cases, it teaches us, that even though it appears to be forbidden, there is no blessing recited in the midst of a transgression.
והכותי – From the those who worship idols and constellations which the King of Ashur brought [with him] from Cuth (a Babylonian town whence Assyrian colonists were introduced into Samaria) and from the other lands and dwell with them in the cities of Samaria who converted out of fear of lions that would eat them as explained in II Kings 17:24-41. And they observed the written Torah and all the commandments that they took hold of, they observed punctiliously more than the Israelites, therefore, people accepted them in some of the commandments until they examined them [more closely] and found among them the image of the pigeon at the top of Mount Gerizim that they would worship and from then on, they considered them as those who totally worship idols and constellations. Therefore, nowadays, we do not invite a Cuthean to participate [in the group recitation of ברכת המזון; see especially verse 41 of II Kings 24.)
אכל טבל – Grain from which the heave-offering (for the Kohen) and the tithes (i.e. First and Second Tithes) had not been taken is called TEVEL/טבל [where produce is in that stage in which the separation of Levitical and Priestly shares respectively is required, before you may partake of them], and the explanation of טבל is “it is not good” (the word טבל is a aggregate of these two words), and it is not necessary to say, טבל according to the Torah, but even טבל according to the Rabbis, such as grain that grew in a pot without a hole, which is only considered טבל according to the Rabbis, we don’t invite that individual to participate [in the group recitation of] ברכת המזון.
ומעשר ראשון שלא נטלה תרומתו – We are not dealing with תרומת מעשר (the tithe that the LEVITE must make to the KOHEN from what he received from other Israelites as מעשר ראשון/First Tithe), since that is complete TEVEL – but rather such as the case where the Levite preceded a Kohen at a pile [of grain] after it had been shaped into an even pile, which had been designated for TERUMAH from the Torah, and he (the Levite) took the First Tithe first and one-fiftieth of it is appropriate for the תרומה גדולה/the Great Terumah for the Kohen, and as long as he (the Levite) did not give from it תרומה גדולה, even though he separated out תרומת מעשר (the heave-offering of the tithe), we don’t invite him to join the group [recitation of ברכת המזון]. But if he (the Levite) came prior [to the Kohen] with regard to ears of corn, he does not have to separate the heave offering/תרומה גדולה, as we have written of above earlier.
ומעשר שני והקדש שלא נפדו – And we don’t need to say that they were not redeemed at all, for this matter is simple, but rather, that they were redeemed, but not redeemed properly , such as the case where a person redeemed the Second Tithe/מעשר שני in broken ware vessels of silver or in a coin that did not have a shape as the All Merciful-One (God) said (Deuteronomy 14:25), “Wrap up the money [and take it with you to the place that the LORD your God has chosen],” in a form that has a shape, and that which was sanctified for the Sanctuary which was redeemed by land and not by money, for the All-Merciful One (God) said (Deuteronomy 14:25), “You may convert them into money” (not the exact quotation in the Hebrew).
והשמש שאכל פחות מכזית – [This section of the Mishnah] is questionable/unnecessary, but since he retracted for the majority, out of need, , he also retracted for this.
והעובד כוכבים – We are speaking of a [potential] convert who [was] circumcised but did not [as yet] immerse [in a Mikveh/Ritual bath], for as long as he did not immerse, he is an idolater (non-Jew), and he is not [considered] a convert until he is [both] circumcised and immersed [in a Ritual bath/Mikveh].

Mishnah 2

וקטנים אין מזמנין עליהם – Especially small children who do not know to Whom they are reciting a blessing (ברכת המזון ) a minor who knows to Whom He is reciting a blessing, they may invite him to join [in the group recitation of ברכת המזון], and there is something remarkable that says that we are not speaking about a minor who knows to Whom they are reciting the blessing that we invite him to join [in the group recitation of ברכת המזון] but rather with a child who is thirteen years of age plus one day, who has not brought forth two pubic hairs (which demonstrate his having attained adulthood), and he is called a “blossoming minor” but younger than this, we do not invite him to join [in the group recitation of ברכת המזון] , even if he knows to Whom we are reciting this blessing. And in the Jerusalem Talmud, they bring the Practical Halakha, that we don’t invite the Minor at all, until he grows up and brings forth two pubic hairs. And women invite other [women] to recite ברכת המזון as a group for themselves and slaves invite other [slaves] to recite ברכת המזוןas a group for themselves., but women are not [invited] with slaves because of licentiousness [that would ensue].

Mishnah 3

בשלשה והוא אומר ברכו – For even without himself, there is a group to be invited/Zimmun and similarly for all of them.
אחד עשרה ואחד עשרה רבוא – The beginning of the Mishnah is Rabbi Akiba as he said, just as we find in the synagogue when we have arrived at ten, there is no division [of the community] whether there are many or few, so too here [in this case], there is no division [of the group into smaller units].
במאה אומר נברך לה' אלהינו – The concluding phrase of the Mishnah is all [according to] Rabbi Yosi HaGelili, who said that according to majority of the community, they recite the [appropriate] blessing, as it says, “Psalms 68:27): “ln assemblies bless God,[ the LORD, O you who are from the fountain of Israel].” But the Halakhic decision is that from three [adult males] until ten [adult males] but the tenth is not included, the person who blesses (as the leader) recites: “Let us bless [Him] that we have eaten from what is His, and everyone answers: “Blessed that we have eaten from what is His, and through His Goodness we live.” And ten or from ten and above, the person leading the blessing states, “We give praise to God that we have eaten from what is His and through His goodness we live.
רבי ישמעאל אומר ברכו את ה' המבורך – and the Halakha is according to Rabbi Yishmael.

Mishnah 4

אינן רשאין לחלק – Since an obligation of invitation [to a group recitation of ברכת המזון] falls upon them.
וכן ארבעה וכן חמשה – The “three” [of that group of four or five] (cannot separate) to recite ברכת המזון for themselves and the individual should separate himself off from them, for he also has an established obligation for the appeal to participate in the group recitation [of ברכת המזון], it says Psalms 68:27), “In assemblies bless God, [the LORD, O you are from the fountain of Israel].” And the determined Halakhic practice is that from three individuals until ten individuals, but not including ten, the person reciting the blessing says, “Let us thank Him whose food we have eaten/נברך שאכלנו משלו,” and everyone responds, “ברוך שאכלנו משלו ובטובו חיינו/Blessed is [He] whose food we have eaten and through whose goodness we live.” And with ten or more than ten people, the leader says, “נברך לאלהינו שאכלנו משלו/Blessed is our God whose food we have eaten.” And everyone answers: “ברוך לאלהינו שאכלנו משלו ובטובו חיינו/Blessed is our God whose food we have eaten and through whose Goodness we live.”
ששה נחלקין – in order to have a group recitation (of three individuals for ברכת המזון) and another equivalent group over there, until one reaches the number “ten.” But with ten individuals, we do not divide the group since it would obligate them to a have a group recitation including the mention of God’s name until there would be twenty and only then could they divide into two [separate] groups if they desired.

Mishnah 5

ואם לאו אלו מזמנין לעצמן – And at the time where the attendant/waiter serves the two groups, even though each group does not see the other, the waiter/attendant combines them.
אין מברכין על היין – “Who Creates the Fruit of the Vine/בורא פרי הגפן”.
Until putting water into it, since their wine is extremely strong, and it was not appropriate to drink without water [added to it]. Therefore, since it was not changed for the better, and he did not change his blessing, we recite on it [the blessing] “בורא פרי העץ/Who Creates the fruit of trees,” like [we would recite] on grapes. But the Halakha does not follow Rabbi Eliezer.

Chapter 8



Mishnah 1

אלו דברים – [According to the School of Shammai], he recites the blessing on the [Sabbath and/or Holy] Day – at the beginning the Sanctification of the Day and afterwards, recites the blessing on the wine, “Who creates the fruit of the vine/בורא פרי הגפן”, since he first sanctifies the day and afterwards the wine comes on the table because of the day – and just as he sanctified [the day] at its outset, similarly before the blessing of the wine (based upon the principle: "תדיר ושאינו תדיר, תדיר קודם"/"That which is more frequent vs. that which is less frequent, the more frequent comes first” – see Tractate Horayot, Chapter 3, Mishnah 6).
מברך על היין – [According to the School of Hillel, he recites the blessing on the wine] first, and the same applies to making Kiddush on the Bread (if he lacks fruit of the vine) since the wine or the bread cause [the need to] Sanctification of the Day, for if he doesn’t have wine or bread, he cannot recite the Sanctification/Kiddush.

Mishnah 2

בית שמאי אומרים: נוטלין לידים ואחר כך מוזגין את הכוס – For if you say “pour the cup” first, as a preventive measure, lest they defile the liquids that fell on the back of the cup on account of one’s hands, for hands prior to washing them are considered impure in the second-degree, and they defile liquids to become impure in the first-degree, and these liquids would come back and defile the outer surface of the cup, for the liquids that were defiled, defile utensils, according to the Rabbis, but they were lenient in this defilement for the utensil whose back was defiled by liquids [which] are impure, what is inside [the utensil] is not defiled nor one’s hands nor its (the utensil’s) rim. And the School of Shammai thinks that it is forbidden to use the cup whose back is impure, even though the inside was not defiled, as a preventive measure, lest splashing [of liquid] of drops from inside [the cup] touch the outer surface of the cup , and the liquids would acquire defilement on account of the outside of the cup, and would defile the hands, and since it is forbidden to use a utensil whose outside are impure, therefore, we wash our hands first and thereafter pour the cup [of wine], in order that the liquid on the outside of the utensil would not receive defilement on account of the hands – and the outside of the utensils would be found to be [ritually] impure, on account of those liquids and we would be using something that is in a forbidden state; but the School of Hillel thinks that there is no prohibition to use a utensil whose external parts are impure; therefore, we pour the cup [of wine] first and drink it and afterwards wash the hands, for if one would say that we wash the hands first and afterwards pour the cup, as a preventive measure lest the external parts of the cup would be impure, for it is permitted to handle a utensil whose external parts are impure, even if one’s hands are not dried well , which would defile the external parts of the utensil, the liquids on his hands and those liquids that had been made “first-degree” impure would defile the hands and it would be found that he would be eating with unclean hands.

Mishnah 3

מקנח ידיו במפה – From his first hand-washing and place it on the table and wipe his hands with it throughout from the filth of the cooked food; and he should not place it [the napkin] on the cushion on which he sits, as a preventive measure, lest the cushion becomes defiled in the first-degree, and the liquid comes in close contact with the napkin on account of the drying of the hands, and that liquid when it comes in contact with the cushion becomes [defiled] in the first-[degree], and the liquids become [defiled] in the first-[degree], and defile the hands when one wipes [one’s hands] with it continuously during the meal, but concerning the table [itself], there is no preventive measure made, for it is forbidden to use a table which is defiled in the second-degree. But the School of Hillel holds that it is permitted to use a table which is impure in the second-degree. Therefore, he should not leave the napkin on the table, lest the liquids become defiled that are on the napkin on account of the table and in turn would defile the food there, and if he leaves [the napkin] on the cushion, everyone should not suspect lest his hands became defiled; better that his hands become defiled – since they are not an essential principle from Torah law, since the washing of the hands for unconsecrated objects is not from the Torah and they don’t defile foods which have an essential principle from the Torah, for [something that is] unclean from the first-degree makes something unclean in the second-degree for unconsecrated objects from the Torah [perspective].

Mishnah 4

בית שמאי אומרים: מכבדין את הבית – A place where they ate [a meal], we put the room in order (i.e. clean it/sweep it} from the remnants of the food that became crumbled on it, and afterwards, we wash our hands with מים אחרונים/The Latter Waters, since there are times when the attendant is an עם ארץ/ignoramus (and someone not necessarily punctilious in the separation of tithe) and he leaves the crumbs of an olive’s bulk there, and if one says that one should wash one’s hands first, you might lose the foods from the “Latter Waters/מים אחרונים” that spray on them and become detestable. The School of Hillel holds that it is prohibited to use an attendant who is an ignoramus (of Jewish law, especially, the laws of ritual purity), since an attendant who is a Torah scholar would not leave crumbs of an olive’s bulk, but would remove them, and if the water ( מים האחרונים) sprays upon the crumbs, it is meaningless, since those crumbs do not add up to an olive’s bulk, it is permitted to get rid of them with one’s hand. But the Halakha is in accordance with the School of Shammai in that it is permissible to use an attendant who is an ignoramus.

Mishnah 5

נר ומזון – He who ate on Shabbat after [reciting] the Minha/Afternoon Service, and it became dark and he had not yet completed his meal and he doesn’t have more than a cup’s worth of wine, the School of Shammai states: [One recites the blessings for] the Candle, the Meal, the spices and the Havdalah prayer, since everyone [holds] that Havdalah [is recited] at the end, so that when one “leaves” a day, we do it as late [as possible] in order that it (the Sabbath) would not seem to him like a burden. They (the Schools of Hillel and Shammai) did not disagree other than on the Candle and on the Spices, for the School of Shammai holds [that we recite the blessings in the following order]: Candle, the Meal, and afterwards the Spices. And the School of Hillel says [that we recite the blessings in the following order]: The Candle, and the Spices, since both the Candle and Spices are mutually blessings that we can do and they do not appear as a burden, such as the Candle and Spices [which are recited] prior to ברכת המזון
בית שמאין אומרים שברא מאור האש – Who created, which implies in the past, and not “who creates,” which implies in the future.
מאור האש – and not the “lights of fire” since one “light” is found in a fire.
ובית הלל אומרים בורא – which also implies in the past
מאורי האש – There are many colors in the flame: red, white and greenish.

Mishnah 6

לא על הנר ולא על הבשמים – of an idolater. The [Havdalah] Candle because he [the idolater] did not rest on the Sabbath and did work by its candles, and we hold that light that did not “rest,” should not have blessing recited on it, since it was used in [acts of] transgression; and the spices of gentiles – we are speaking about the spices that are used at the dining parties of idolaters and constellation worshippers who are guests at them and since it is taught at the conclusion of the Mishnah “and not on the [Havdalah] candle and not on the Spices that are before the gods of the idolaters and constellation worshippers – what is the reason that it is said? What is the reason that we do not make a blessing on the spices of idolaters and constellation worshippers? Because it is considered a mere idolatrous dinner party for their god, and we don’t recite a blessing on the spices of those who are idolaters and constellation worshippers.
ולא על הנר של מתים –that we should make use their light even for mere honor.
ולא על בשמים של מתים – That we would use it to remove the odor.
ולא על נר ובשמים – of idolaters and constellation worshippers , since it is forbidden to derive benefit from them.
עד שיאותו לאורו – That they would benefit from its light, but not benefit in actuality, but it is so close to it, that one could benefit if one desired.

Mishnah 7

שיתעכל המזון שבמעיו – As long as he is not hungry on account of that meal, it is a sign that the food was not consumed in his stomach. And specifically, [when] he forgot, the School of Hillel says that he should not go back, but if he did it on purpose, everyone agrees that he should return to the place [where he ate] and recite the blessing [of ברכת המזון].

Mishnah 8

מברך על היין ואחר כך מברך על המזון – Since [the recitation of] ברכת המזון/The Blessing after the Meal does not require a cup [of wine]. But the School of Hillel holds that ברכת המזון requires a cup.
עונין אמן אחר ישראל המברך – And even though he did not hear the mention of The (God’s) Name other than at the end of the blessing, since it is assumed that towards Heaven, he recited a blessing.
אלא אם כן שמע כל הברכה – lest he (i.e., the Cuthean) recited a blessing towards Mount Gerizim.

Chapter 9



Mishnah 1

מקום שנעשו בו נסים – such as the place where the Israelites crossed the Sea of Reeds and the stream of Arnon (see Numbers, chapter 21, verses 13 and following), and the fords of the Jordan River [where the Israelites crossed – see Joshua, chapter 3 verse 14 and following] the stone on which Moses, of blessed memory, sat when he fought the war against Amalek (see Exodus chapter 17, verse 12) and other similar occurrences. And public miracles such as these require everyone to recite a blessing, but individual miracles such as person who sees a place where a [personal] miracle had occurred for him, he himself is obligated to recite a blessing, “Praised [Are You, O LORD] who performed for a miracle in this bless,” and his son and grandson are obligated to recite the blessing, “Praised [Are You, O LORD] who performed a miracle for my ancestors in this place.” And all these blessings of our Mishnah require the mention of the Name of God and His Sovereignty – for any blessing which lacks the mention of God’s name and His sovereignty is not a blessing.

Mishnah 2

זיקין – A star that appears like it opens up the firmament and shoots like an arrow from place to place. Alternatively, it is a star that appears like it has a long tail.
זועות – That the earth quakes and trembles.
רעמים – Sound is that heard in the firmament from clouds that pour forth water from one to another, as it says (Jeremiah 51:16), “When He makes His voice heard, There is a rumbling of waters in the skies.”
ועל הרוחות – that come in a storm-wind in vehemence and are not found other than occasionally.
ברוך שכחו מלא עולם – And if he desires, he should recite the blessing, “Praised [are You God] who is the Author of Creation” for all of these are acts of creation as it is written (Psalms 135:7), “[He makes clouds rise from the end of the earth;] He makes lightning for the rain ; [He releases the wind from His vaults],”but on the mountains and on the hills, etc., one says, “Who is the Author of Creation, specifically, but he is not able to make the blessing on them, “that His power fills the world” which are not seen in most of the world, but rather each and every person [recites the blessing] in his place.
הים הגדול – The Mediterranean Sea that surrounds the world (at least as the ancients understood it).
ברוך שעשה הים הגדול – On account of its size and importance, establishes a blessing for itself.
לפרקים – At thirty day intervals
על הגשמים – He recites the blessing, “Who Is Good and Does Good” as whomever possesses land in partnership with another, for this is implies "הטוב והמטיב"/Who is Good and Does Good”; – Good – for himself and “who does good”- for another; but he who lacks land altogether should say, “We give thanks to You, O LORD our God for every drop [of rain] that you have caused to fall for us, etc.” And if he owns land on his own, he makes the blessing, “שהחיינו/Who has Kept Us Alive.”

Mishnah 3

בנה בית חדש וקנה כלים חדשים – whether he had it or something similar to it or he didn’t have something similar to them, he would recite the blessing “שהחיינו/who has sustained us.”
על הרעה מעין הטובה – It is explained in the Gemara (Tractate Berakhot 59b) such as the case where water floated on his land and flooded his grain for that year, even though the waters saturated the face of the earth but his field became even more praiseworthy for the coming years. Now, however, it is bad, and he recites the blessing, “[Praised Are You, O LORD] the Righteous Judge.”
ועל הטובה מעין הרעה – Such as the case where he found something [good] even though it is bad, for had he heard about it, the king would have punished him with whippings and sufferings and take it from him. Now, however, it is a “good thing, and he should recite the blessing, “הטוב והמטיב/Who is Good and Does Good.”
הצועק לשעבר – A person prays about something that already had occurred, this is a vain prayer, for what has occurred, has occurred.

Mishnah 4

שתים בכניסתו ושנים ביציאתו – When he is entering, he says, [“Praised are You, O LORD] that you will bring me into this city in peace” . When he has entered, he says, “I give thanks before You, that you have brought me into this city in peace.” Behold this is twice at his entrance. When he desires to leave, he says, “[Praised are You, O LORD] that you will take me out from this city in peace.” After he has left, he says, “I give thanks before You, that you have taken me out of this city in peace.” And so much [praise – before and after], why? Because a person must express gratitude before his Creator on what he has endured from the good, and he should pray about the future that should occur for good.

Mishnah 5

חייב אדם לברך על הרעה – When one makes the blessing “The True and Righteous Judge,” on the bad things [that occur], one is obligated to recite the blessing in joy and with a full-heart, just as one recites with joy the blessing, “Who is Good and Does Good” on the good things [that happen].
דבר אחר: "בכל מאדך" – with all of the measures that are measured out to you, whether for good or for retribution.
לא יקל אדם ראשו – He should not act with irreverence.
כנגד שער מזרח – Outside of the Temple Mount where the low wall which is at foot of the Temple to the east, since it is designed that all of the gates correspond one opposite the other – the Eastern Gate, the Gate of the Women’s Court, the Gate of the Israelite Court and the Opening of the [Great[ Hall, and the [Holy] Hall and the House of the Holy of Holies in the First Temple.
ובאפונדתו – A hollow region where they put money. Another explanation: Clothing that is worn on his skin to receive the sweat so that it would not soil the rest of one’s clothing, for it is shameful for a person to leave [his home] with only that [piece of] clothing.
קפנדריא – to enter through one opening and to exit from the opposite opening in order to shorten his walk in that path. And the word KAPANDARIA [means] (using a phonetic etymology [in Aramaic] using the letters KUF, FEY, NUN and DALET and RESH, that is to say, that instead of going around rows of houses, I will shorten the distance of my walk and enter via this path.
ורקיקה – Which is prohibited on the Temple Mount.
מקל וחומר – From the shoe. Just as a shoe is not a form of disrespect, [yet] which is forbidden [to be worn on the Temple Mount], spitting which is an act of contempt, all the more so (see Tosefta Berakhot 6:19).
כל חותמי ברכות שהיו במקדש – He who makes a blessing says at the conclusion of each blessing (Berakhot 54a), “Praised is the LORD the God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting, Who Bestows Knowledge.” And thereafter, everyone responds, saying: “Praised be the Name of His glorious Kingdom forever and ever,” for we do not answer “Amen” after every blessing [that is recited] in the Temple, as it is written (Nehemiah 9:5), “Rise, bless the LORD your God who is from eternity to eternity;” And we say after that: “May Your glorious name be blessed, [exalted though it is above every blessing and praise]!” That is to say, that they would respond, “Praised be the Name of God’s glorious kingdom forever and ever.” And we learn here that in the First Temple [period], they would only say, “Praised is the God of Israel for eternity” and nothing more, and not “from eternity to eternity.”
משקלקלו המינים – Since they [the Sectarians] did not believe in the Resurrection of the Dead and said that that there is no world other than this one, Ezra and his court established that we should say, “from eternity to eternity,” to state that there are two worlds – this world and the next world, to remove from the hearts of the Sectarians who denied belief in the Resurrection of the Dead.
שיהא אדם שואל בשלום חבירו בשם – With the Name of the Holy One, blessed be He, and we do not say that he should treat His (God’s) honor with disrespect in order to honor human beings, to bring forth the name of Heaven upon him, as we learned from Boaz (Ruth 2:4), “He greeted the reaper, ‘The LORD be with you! [And they responded, ‘The LORD bless you!]” And when Boaz said it, he did so willingly, and we do not derive [anything from] it: Come and hear from the angel who said to Gideon (Judges 6:12), “The LORD is with you, valiant warrior.” And if you say, but the angel did not ask the welfare of Gideon nor blessed him, but only through serving as God’s messenger, informing him that God’s presence is with him, and we don’t derive anything from it. Come and hear: Do not despise that you mother is old, and do not despise Boaz to say that he did so (i.e., greet the reapers] of his own accord, but that he was taught from the elders of your people, for there is upon what he can rely, as it states (Psalms 119:126), “It is a time to act for the LORD, for they have violated Your teaching.”
רבי נתן אומר: הפרו תורתך – Sometimes, we set aside the Torah in order to perform act for [the sake of] God, even the individual who intends to ask of the welfare of his neighbor, this is the will of the God, as it states (Psalms 34:15), “Seek amity and pursue it.” It is [thus] permissible to invalidate the Torah and to do something that appears forbidden.
