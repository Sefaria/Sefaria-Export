Bartenura on Mishnah Bikkurim



Chapter 1



Mishnah 1

<b>There are those who bring and recite. </b> [They recite] the reading of <i>bikkurim</i>, from "...My father was a fugitive Aramean..." (Devarim, 26:5)  to the end of the passage.
<b>But [the tree] leans into [another's] private property. </b> [Someone who] dug a hole and inserted in the ground a shoot from a tree [to propagate the tree and create a new one], but the top of the shoot comes out in the field of his neighbor, or in <i>birshut harabim</i>. And in the same way, if the plant stands in the field of his neighbor or in the <i>birshut harabim</i>, and the top of the shoot comes out in his field; [in these cases] he does not bring, as explained next (Mishnah 2),  because not all the growth is in his land.
<b>But a road for an individual or a public road is in the middle </b>. For example, he has two gardens on the two sides of some road; he doesn't bring, because not all the growth is in his land.

Mishnah 2







<b> Are forbidden.</b> [If ]<i> maaser sheni</i> or <i>bikkurim</i> become mixed with <i>chullin</i>, the mixture is forbidden irrespective of the relative quantities, and [they] are not nullified if [the ratio to the <i>chullin</i> is less than] one to a hundred.  
<b>[May] not be eaten in Yerushalaim.</b> That is to say ["may not be eaten if they were mixed while they were in Yerushalayim":] if <i> maaser sheni</i> or <i>bikkurim</i> become mixed with <i>chullin</i> while they are in Yerushalaim, then the mixture is forbidden to be eaten by the laws of <i>chullin</i>, because they are something for which there are reasons to allow [<i>davar sheyesh lo matirin</i>, a category discussed also in Beitzah, 3b: a prohibited item that can be permitted without the process of nullification, and as such the nullification does not take place, not even if mixed in the ratio of a thousand to one] because it is possible to eat the whole mixture where it [already] is, [i.e. Yerushalaim]. But <i> maaser sheni</i> or <i>bikkurim</i> that become mixed with <i>chullin</i> outside of Yerushalaim are not forbidden irrespective of the relative quantities, because it takes effort to bring them up [to Yerushalaim], and as such are not defined as something for which there is reason to allow.
<b>And their growths are forbidden.</b> [In the case of]a mixture of <i> maaser [sheni]</i> or <i>bikkurim</i> that was planted and sprouted and grew, also the growths are forbidden to be eaten by the laws of <i>chullin</i> if they are planted and grown in Yerushalaim. And their mixture is forbidden, irrespective of the relative quantities, because it is possible to eat it there in its place.
