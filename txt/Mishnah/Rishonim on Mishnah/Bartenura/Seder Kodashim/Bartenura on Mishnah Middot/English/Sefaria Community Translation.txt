Bartenura on Mishnah Middot



Chapter 1



Chapter 2



Mishnah 1

<b>The Temple Mount was five hundred cubits.</b> It was enclosed by a wall
<b>The greater part of it was on the south; next to that on the east.</b> Meaning, the distance from the wall of the Temple Mount to the wall of the [Temple] Courtyard on the southern side was greater than the distance between those [walls] on the eastern side. And the distance between those [walls] on the eastern side was greater than the distance between them on the northern side. And the northern [side] was greater than the south[ern side].

Mishnah 2

<b>Entered by the right and went around to the left.</b> For instance, those entering through the <i>Hulda</i> gates that are on the right, they go around [and exit] through the <i>Taddi</i> gate. <i> Translator's Note: Bartenura appears to be interpreting the terms right and left as idioms for south and north respectively. (See Genesis 14:15) </i>
<b> "Because I am a mourner"</b> They ask him, "What is the matter that you go around to the left?" And he says, "Because I am a mourner." [So] they say to him, "The one who dwells in this house shall comfort you." etc.
<b>You make it seem as if they treated him unjustly.</b> If they [the people entering the Temple Mount] said this to him, it appears as if his friends warped the law and judged him incorrectly.
<b>He should inspire you to listen to the words of your friends.</b> This implies that he erred and needs repentance. The law follows Rabbi Yose.  

Mishnah 3

<b>Within.</b> The walls of the Temple Mount.
<b><i>Soreg </i>(Lattice).</b> A barrier made with many holes like a staff braided with cords. It was made from long narrow planks of wood that intersect each other diagonally.
<b>They enacted that thirteen prostrations should be made facing them.</b> As one reaches each breach, he prostrates and gives thanks for the destruction of the Hellenistic Kingdom.
<b>Within</b> The Lattice there was an empty area of ten cubits. It was called the <i>Hel</i>.
<b>There were twelve steps there.</b> To ascend from there to the Womens' Courtyard.
<b>The height of each step.</b> Each step was a half cubit taller than the previous step, and the first step was a half cubit taller than the ground.
<b>Its tread.</b> The measure of the width of the step, which is the place where the foot treads, was a half cubit.
<b> Except for the Entrance Hall.</b> Except for the stairs that were between the Entrance Hall and the Alter for they were not all like that. As it is taught in chapter three.
<b>Except for the door to the Entrance Hall.</b> As it is taught later on in the other chapters, its height was forty cubits and its width twenty. 
 <b>They had lintels.</b> A stone [that] is placed upon the two posts that the door rests on. <i>Shekufot</i> has the same root as <i>Mashkof</i>(lintel).
<b>Because a miracle happened with them.</b> As it is explained in Yoma chapter three (Yoma 38a).
<b>Gleamed like gold.</b> As in [the word] <i>Mazhivot</i> (Gleamed like gold), for their appearance was similar to gold. Therefore they did not need to [re]make it out of gold.

Mishnah 4

<b>All the wall that were there.</b> Regarding all the buildings on the Temple Mount.
<b>They were</b> very<b> high.</b> Since all of their doorways were [already] twenty cubits tall, without [measuring the wall that continued] above the doorways.
<b>Except for the eastern wall.</b> It was the lowest of the ?retaining walls? (lit. feet) of the Temple Mount.
<b>For the priest who burned the heifer would stand on the Mount of Olives (<i>Har Hammishha</i>).</b> It is the Mount of Olives (<i>Har Hazzeitim</i>) that faces Jerusalem from the east. The priest would face west and look beyond the top of the wall [of the Temple Mount] through the gates that are within it to the doorway of the Hall, as he sprinkled the blood. As it is written: <i>"Sprinkle it toward the front of the tent of meeting"</i>. (Numbers 19:4) If the wall was [as] tall [as the other walls], even though the gates were in line with each other, [meaning] the Temple Mount gate was directly opposite the Womens' Courtyard gate, and the Womens' Courtyard gate was opposite the Great Courtyard gate, and the Great Courtyard gate was opposite the doorway of the Hall, he would [still] not be able to see the doorway of the Hall through [all of] the gates, since the Mountain's slope increased to a height by which the ground of the doorway of the Hall was twenty two cubits taller than the ground on the foot of the Temple Mount, so the threshold of the Hall was higher than the lintel of the gate of the Temple Mount by two cubits, since the the gate of the Temple Mount was only twenty cubits tall as it was taught above. This means that the priest who slaughtered the heifer would not be able to see the doorway of the Hall through the gate [of the Temple Mount, therefore the eastern wall was shorter in order to allow the priest to see the doorway of the Hall from the Mount of Olives].
