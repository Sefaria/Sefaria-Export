Rambam on Mishnah Horayot

Introduction

It is necessary to preface this tractate with fundamental principles that are essential for anyone seeking to understand it. Firstly, there are thirty-nine categories of prohibited actions, each of which carries the penalty of excision (karet). These are explicitly stated in the Torah, and for unintentional transgressions of any of these prohibitions, one is required to bring a sin offering (chatat). All of these are enumerated at the beginning of Tractate Keritot, and they are explained there. Included in these thirty-nine categories is the prohibition of idolatry (avodat kochavim).
When one unintentionally violates any of these thirty-nine categories and is obligated to bring a sin offering, the offering is a goat or a lamb, as explained in the portion of Vayikra (Leviticus) when it states, "And if one soul sins unintentionally... he shall bring his offering, a female goat a year old for a sin offering" (Leviticus 4:27). However, if the individual who unintentionally transgressed is the only one in the entire nation who violated the prohibition of idolatry, the sin offering he is required to bring is a goat, as it is written in the portion of Shelach (Numbers) when it states, "And if any one soul shall sin unwittingly... he shall bring a she-goat of the first year for a sin offering" (Numbers 15:27). This is because the verse in Shelach specifically mentions unintentional transgressions. Therefore, it is explained that when referring to unintentional transgressions, it is as if the Torah states, "And if you unintentionally transgress and do not observe all these commandments" (Numbers 15:22). Our Sages have said that this mitzvah is equivalent to all the other mitzvot combined, as is explained in the Sifrei (a Midrashic work) on that portion.
Furthermore, if the Great Sanhedrin of seventy-one judges unintentionally violates any of these thirty-nine categories and rules erroneously, permitting one of them, and the entire nation follows their ruling, and it later becomes known that they erred in their ruling, the Sanhedrin is required to bring a young bull for a sin offering, as it states, "And if the whole congregation of Israel sins through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly... they shall offer a young bull for a burnt offering" (Leviticus 4:13). However, the congregation, who acted according to the ruling of the Sanhedrin, is exempt from offering a sin offering. If the Sanhedrin erroneously permits any of the prohibitions, even without committing any act, and the entire nation also errs and acts according to their opinion, the Sanhedrin is required to bring a young bull and a goat for burnt and sin offerings, respectively, as explained in the portion of Shelach (Numbers 15:24). This applies when they inadvertently permit certain forbidden fats, claiming that they are permissible and not considered as milk, and the majority of the congregation consumes them according to their ruling. Afterwards, they realize that they ruled in error, but they do not know which specific forbidden fat they permitted or which forbidden blood they permitted, or the like. In such a case, the Sanhedrin is not obligated to bring a young bull for a sin offering, as it states, "And it shall be, if the whole congregation of Israel sins through ignorance... and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly" (Numbers 15:24). The bull that the Sanhedrin brings for the other commandments is referred to as a "bull of uncertain status" (par ha'elem), and the goat brought for the sin offering is referred to as a "goat of uncertain status" (se'ir ha'elem). Likewise, those who acted according to their ruling are exempt from bringing offerings. Even though the entire nation says to them, "The specific fat is permitted," as it states, "And the sin that they have sinned concerning it becomes known" (Numbers 15:24), the transgressors themselves do not know which specific forbidden substance they erroneously permitted. When even one of these conditions is lacking, the obligation of bringing the "bull of uncertain status" or the "bull and goat of uncertain status" is waived. The ruling is then the same as for individuals, and anyone who inadvertently transgresses without the Sanhedrin's instruction is liable to bring an individual sin offering appropriate for that sin, whether it is done by the Sanhedrin themselves or by the rest of the nation. If they do not act, they are not liable for anything. However, when all the conditions specified in this chapter are met, the entire nation is exempt from what they did, and the obligation falls upon the Sanhedrin, for they erred in their ruling. Even though the people did not perform any act, they are obligated to bring an offering based on the instruction given to them. The fundamental principle is that an act depends on the community and the instruction of the Sanhedrin. Even though these conditions are explained in this chapter, I am mentioning them so that they are always ready. The first condition is that the head of the yeshiva (academy) should be present and all seventy-one members of the Sanhedrin are with him. The second condition is that none of them should be disqualified, and all of them should be eligible to serve as members of the Great Sanhedrin. The third condition is that they all err together, and there should be no dispute among them regarding their ruling and what they permitted. The fourth condition is that they err in matters concerning the interpretation of a verse or matters derived from it, as will be explained. The fifth condition is that they act according to the instruction of the people of the land or the majority of them, meaning that Ephraim and Menasheh are not considered as two tribes in this matter; rather, they are not counted as two tribes in relation to inheritance alone. The sixth condition is that those who act according to their instruction do so inadvertently, thinking in their hearts that the true law is as they have been taught, without knowing that they are mistaken, and they act according to their instruction. The seventh condition is that the Sanhedrin themselves know that they erred in a particular matter and it is not concealed from them, even though those who acted according to their instruction know that most of the people say to them that a particular fat is permitted, as it states, "And the sin that they have sinned concerning it becomes known, and the congregation shall offer a young bull for a sin offering" (Numbers 15:24), and the transgressors do not know which specific fat or blood they permitted, or something similar. When even one of these conditions is lacking, the ruling regarding the offering of the "bull of uncertain status" or the "bull and goat of uncertain status" does not apply. Even if one of these conditions is absent, the ruling is the same as for individuals, and anyone who inadvertently transgresses without the instruction of the Sanhedrin is liable to bring an individual sin offering appropriate for that sin, as explained earlier. Now, having reflected upon these fundamental principles, which serve as the key to this tractate, I will now begin to explain it.

As is known, men are responsible to fulfill all the commandments and women are responsible for some of them, as explained previously in Kiddushin.   He is more holy and therefore takes precedence in life and death matters.  
And when it is said that both of them are at risk of molestation, Heaven forbid, when both of them are held captive and the captors desire them both for relations, the man is redeemed before the woman because this [type of behavior] is not the way of a man and their desire for him is not natural for him.
