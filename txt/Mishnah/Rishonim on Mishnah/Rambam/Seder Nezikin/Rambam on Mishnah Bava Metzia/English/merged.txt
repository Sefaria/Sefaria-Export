Mishnah 1



Mishnah 2

If a person hires artisans to harvest his field - for example - for two denarii and he gives them one denarius, if they change their minds [about performing the task], if they wish they can return the denarius to him or they can say to him, we will do [the portion of the job] that you have already paid us for. But - if [the workers] have already harvested half the field and they want to change their minds - [the field's owner] can make an evaluation of the value of their labor and if it exceeds one denarius, he does not need to give them more than the denarius that he has already given to them. And he can say to them, finish the job of harvesting the field and I will pay you your wage. And this is the meaning of "if they change their minds - they are in the weaker position." And if the owner changes his mind, he is in the weaker position. And he must give to [the workers] the value of their labor, if they should be paid more than one denarius. And [the Mishnah] said "whoever alters the agreement is in the weaker position": This is as we explained it, if a person purchases land and makes partial payment, if the seller is the one who changed his mind, the purchaser has the choice. If he wishes,  he can take the amount of land that corresponds to his payment from the best land in the field that he bought. And if the purchaser is the one who changed his mind about the purchase - the situation is reversed. So long as [the purchaser] said "my earnest money acquires [the field]," he acquires the amount that corresponds to the money. And if the seller demands what remains of the money [to be paid for the field] and [the purchaser] delays payment - the sale is not complete until [the purchaser] pays the [full amount].

Mishnah: "One who eats while working, even during a meal, and one who writes, even during a meal, etc." Commentary: "The first Tanna (authority) holds that one should not teach him (the person who eats or writes during a meal), while the sages say that one should teach him, and the halacha follows the opinion of the sages."
