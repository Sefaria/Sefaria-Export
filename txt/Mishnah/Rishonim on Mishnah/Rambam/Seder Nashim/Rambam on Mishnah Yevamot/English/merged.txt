The levir who performs the levirate marriage with his brother's widow is considered as one of the brothers for inheritance. The levir who performs the levirate marriage with his brother's widow is prohibited from marrying her close relatives.
The main principle in this is that when a person performs the levirate marriage with his brother's wife, it is as if she was his own wife and he divorced her. All the prohibitions that apply to close relatives of a divorced wife also apply to the close relatives of his levirate wife. Similarly, he is forbidden to marry the sister-in-law of his levirate wife, as the sister-in-law of his levirate wife is considered as ervah (forbidden relation), and we have already explained (in Chapter 1, Halacha 1) that the sister-in-law of one's ervah is forbidden.
