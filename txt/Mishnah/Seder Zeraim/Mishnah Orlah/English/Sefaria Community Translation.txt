Mishnah Orlah



Chapter 1



Chapter 2

<i>Terumah</i> [a portion of a crop given to a <i>Kohen</i>, priest, pl. <i>Kohanim</i>, which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by <i>Kohanim</i> or their household] and <i>Terumat Ma'aser</i> [a tenth of the tithe given to a <i>Levi</i>, Levite, which must, in turn, be given to a <i>Kohen</i> and which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by <i>Kohanim</i> or their household] of <i>Demai</i> [produce from which it is uncertain whether tithes were already taken], <i>Challah</i> [a portion of a batch of bread dough given to a <i>Kohen</i> which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by <i>Kohanim</i> or their household] and <i>Bikkurim</i> [first-fruits that must be brought to the Temple in Jerusalem and given to the <i>Kohen</i>] are nullified in one hundred and one parts, and they are mixed together and require elevation. <i>Orlah</i> [the fruit of a tree during the first three years after its planting, the consumption or usage of which is forbidden] and <i>Kilayim</i> [the product of forbidden crossbreeding] of the vineyard are nullified in two hundred and one parts, and they are mixed together, and they do not require elevation. Rabbi Shimon says, they are not mixed together. Rabbi Eliezer says, they are mixed with the giver of flavor, but not to forbid.
<i>Terumah</i> can [add volume to achieve the minimum to] neutralize <i>Orlah</i>, and <i>Orlah</i> can [add volume to achieve the minimum to] neutralize <i>Terumah</i>. How so? A <i>Se'ah</i> [a specific unit of volume] of <i>Terumah</i> which fell into one hundred [<i>Se’ah</i> of normal foodstuff], and afterwards three <i>Kavin</i> of <i>Orlah</i> or three <i>Kavin</i> of mixed seed in the vineyard fell in; this is [an instance] where <i>Terumah</i> can neutralize <i>Orlah</i>, and <i>Orlah</i> can neutralize <i>Terumah</i>. 
<i>Orlah</i> can neutralize <i>Kilayim</i>, and <i>Kilayim</i> [neutralize] <i>Orlah</i>, and <i>Orlah</i> [neutralize] <i>Orlah</i>. How so? A <i>Se’ah</i> of <i>Orlah</i> which falls into two hundred [<i>Se’ah</i> of normal foodstuff] and afterwards more than a  <i>Se’ah</i> of <i>Orlah</i> [falls in], or more than a <i>Se’ah</i> of <i>Kilayim</i> of the vineyard; this is [a case] where <i>Orlah</i> can neutralize <i>Kilayim</i>, and <i>Kilayim</i> [can neutralize] <i>Orlah</i>, and <i>Orlah</i> [can neutralize] <i>Orlah</i>. 
All that cause fermentation, or season, or make a mixture <i>Meduma</i> [mixture of <i>Chullin</i>, permitted foodstuff, and <i>Terumah</i> that is forbidden to non-<i>Kohanim</i>] when mixed with <i>Terumah</i> or with <i>Orlah</i> or with <i>Kilayim</i> of the vineyard, is prohibited. Bet Shammai say, it also defiles. But Bet Hillel say, it does not defile unless it has [the volume of] an egg.
Dostai, of the village of Yitmah, was one of the disciples of Bet Shammai, and he said, I received a tradition from Shammai the elder who said, it [one of the items mentioned above] never defiles unless it contains [the volume of an] egg. 
And concerning what they said, All that cause fermentation, or season, or make a mixture <i>Meduma</i> when is [the rule applied] stringently? [In the case of] a species [mixed] with its [like] species. [When is the rule applied sometimes] leniently and [sometimes] stringently? [In the case of] a species [mixed] with a different kind of species. How so? If leaven of wheat fell into wheat dough and there is enough to cause leavening, whether there is enough to neutralize in one hundred and one, or there is not enough to neutralize in one hundred and one, it is prohibited. If there is not enough to neutralize in one hundred and one, whether there is enough to cause leavening or there is not enough to cause leavening, it is prohibited. 
How is [this teaching of “All that cause fermentation, or season, or make a mixture <i>Meduma</i>” applied to yield both] a lenient and a strict ruling, [in the case of] one kind [of produce] mixed with [produce] of the same kind? Crushed beans [of <i>Terumah</i>] that were cooked with lentils [which are not <i>Terumah</i>], and they contain enough to impart flavor [to the lentils], whether there was [enough <i>Terumah</i>] to be neutralized in one hundred and one, or whether there is not [enough <i>Terumah</i>] to be neutralized in one hundred and one, it is forbidden [and this is the strict ruling]; if there is not enough of them to impart flavor [to the lentils], whether there was [enough <i>Terumah</i>] to be neutralized in one hundred and one, or whether there is not [enough <i>Terumah</i>] to be neutralized in one hundred and one, it is permitted [and this is the lenient ruling].
If leaven of <i>Chullin</i> has fallen into dough, and there is enough to make it ferment, and after that leaven of <i>Terumah</i> or <i>Kilayim</i> of the vineyard [fell in], and there was enough to cause leavening, [the dough] is prohibited.
If leaven of <i>Chullin</i> has fallen into dough and caused it to ferment, and after that leaven of <i>Terumah</i> or <i>Kilayim</i> of the vineyard fell in, and there was enough to cause leavening, [the dough] is prohibited. [But,] Rabbi Shimon permits it. 
Spices of two or three [categories of prohibitions], of one species, or of three different species of spices [of one category of prohibition], render a mixture prohibited by combining together. Rabbi Shimon says, the mixture of two or three categories of prohibition of one species, or two species of one category of prohibition do not combine together.
Leaven of <i>Chullin</i>, and of <i>Terumah</i> that fell into a dough and individually, each does not have a sufficient quantity to cause fermentation, but taken together, they did cause fermentation: Rabbi Eliezer says, I go after the last one that fell; but the Sages say, regardless of whether the forbidden leaven fell in first, or last, never does the dough become prohibited, unless there is a sufficient amount to cause fermentation on its own.  
Yoezer, a man of Birah, was one of the disciples of the House of Shammai, and he said, I asked Rabban Gamliel the Elder, as he was standing at the Eastern Gate, and he said, regardless of whether the forbidden fell in first, or last, never does the dough become prohibited, unless there is a sufficient amount to cause fermentation on its own.  
Vessels that were oiled [in order to soften them], with impure oil, and were then later re-oiled with pure oil, or they were first oiled with pure oil, and afterwards, were oiled them with impure oil: Rabbi Eliezer says, I go after the first, while the Sages say, [its status follows] after the last.
If leaven of <i>Terumah</i> and leaven of <i>Kilayim</i> of the vineyard fell into a dough and each individually does not have enough of a quantity to effect fermentation, but together, they did cause fermentation, the dough is prohibited to non-<i>Kohanim</i>, and permitted to <i>Kohanim</i>. Rabbi Shimon allows to both non-<i>Kohanim</i> and <i>Kohanim</i>. 
If spices of the <i>Terumah</i> and if <i>Kilayim</i> of the vineyard have fallen into a pot, and each individually does not have a sufficient quantity to properly season, but together, they did cause proper seasoning, it is forbidden to non-<i>Kohanim</i>, but permitted to <i>Kohanim</i>. Rabbi Shimon allows it to both <i>Kohanim</i> and non-<i>Kohanim</i>.
If a piece of the flesh of <i>Kodshei Kodashim</i> [sacrifices of the highest degree of sanctity, they may be slaughtered only on the north-west corner of the altar, and consumed only within the Temple compound by male priests, or burnt entirely.], [or] of <i>Pigul</i> [sacrifice made unfit because of improper intentions], [or] of <i>Notar</i> [sacrifice made unfit because it was left too long uneaten] that was cooked with pieces [of permissible flesh], it is forbidden to non-<i>Kohanim</i>, but permissible to <i>Kohanim</i>. Rabbi Shimon allows it to both <i>Kohanim</i> and non-<i>Kohanim</i>.
If flesh of <i>Kodshei Kodashim</i> and flesh of <i>Kodashim Kalim</i> [sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity, they may be slaughtered anywhere in the Temple courtyard and consumed by most anyone, anywhere in Jerusalem] have been cooked together with non-sanctified [permissible] flesh, it is forbidden to the impure, but permitted for the pure.  

Chapter 3

A garment that has been dyed using peels of an <i>Orlah</i> [the fruit of a tree during the first three years after its planting, the consumption or usage of which is forbidden] must be burnt. If [this garment] got mixed in with other [garments], they must all be burnt; these are the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, it becomes neutralized in [a pile of] two hundred and one [other such garments].
One who dyes [a thread] the length of <i>m'lo hasit</i> [distance between the splayed thumb and forefinger] with peels of an <i>Orlah</i> tree, and then wove them into a garment, but doesn't know which [thread] it is: Rabbi Meir says, one must burn the garment, and the Sages say, it becomes neutralized in [a pile of] two hundred and one [other such garments].
One who weaves [a thread] the length of <i>m'lo hasit</i> from the wool a firstborn animal into a garment, must burn the garment. And [if the thread was from] the hair of a Nazirite or from a firstborn donkey [which needs redemption and he sewed it] into a sack, one must burn the sack. And [with regards to] holy items, they sanctify [whatever they are sewed into], independent of the quantity.
A cooked item which is cooked with the peels of an <i>Orlah</i> must be burnt. If [the cooked item] gets mixed with other [such cooked items], it becomes neutralized in two hundred and one [other such cooked items].
An oven which was lit with shells of <i>Orlah</i>, and bread was baked in it, the bread should be burned. If that bread was mixed with others, it is neutralized in two hundred and one.
One who has bundles of fenugreek which come from a <i>Kilayim</i> [the product of forbidden crossbreeding] of the vineyard must burn them. If [these bundles] got mixed with other [such bundles], they must all be burnt; these are the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, they are neutralized in two hundred and one. 
As Rabbi Meir used to say, if it is the normal way to count [an object, individually], then it renders everything as holy [and thereby forbidden]. But the Sages say that only six things render everything as holy; while Rabbi Akiva says there are seven. They are: nuts with brittle shells, and Badan pomegranates, and sealed jars, and beet shoots, and cabbage heads, and Greek gourds. Rabbi Akiva says, also loaves of bread of homeowners. That which is fit for the [laws of] <i>Orlah</i> is <i>Orlah</i>. That which is fit for [the laws of] <i> Kilayim</i> of the vineyard is <i> Kilayim</i> of the vineyard.
(How so?) If nuts split, pomegranates separate, barrels open, gourds are cut, loaves of bread are crumbled, they are neutralized in two hundred and one.
If there is a doubt about [whether or not a certain fruit is] <i>Orlah</i>: in Israel it is forbidden [to have benefit from it], and in Syria it is permitted, and outside the Land [of Israel], one may go down [to the market] and buy it, as long as one doesn't see the gathering. A vineyard that has vegetables planted in it [rendering them <i>Kilayim</i>] and the vegetables are sold outside [of Israel]: in Israel they are forbidden, and in Syria they are permitted, and outside the Land one can go down [to the market] and buy them as long as one doesn't gather them directly. New [wheat] is forbidden by law of the Torah everywhere. But <i>Orlah</i> [is forbidden] by traditional law ascribed to Moshe and <i>Kilayim</i> [is forbidden] by Rabbinic law.
