A <i>karachat</i> [bald patch] of a vineyard, Beit Shammai say, [one may plant there if it measures twenty-four [square] cubits, and Beit Hillel say, [it must measure] sixteen [square] cubits. The <i>machol</i> [the outer belt] of the vineyard, Beit Sahmmai say, [if it measures] sixteen cubits [one may sow there] and, Beit Hillel say twelve cubits. What is a <i>karachat</i> of a vineyard? A vineyard that became bald in the center. If it be less than sixteen cubits [according to Beit Hillel], one may not sow there, if it is sixteen cubits, it is given its work space [for tillage] and one may sow in the rest. 
What is a <i>machol</i> of the vineyard? The [space] between the vineyard and the fence . If there are not twelve cubits there, he may not sow in that space. If  there were twelve cubits there,  it is given its work space [for tillage] and one may sow in the rest. 
Rabbi Yehudah says, This [above definition of a <i>machol</i>] is nothing more than the fence of a vineyard. What is a <i>machol</i>? [The area] between two vineyards. What is [considered] a fence? Anything that is ten handbreadths high. [What is considered] a trench? That which is ten [handbreadths] deep and four [handbreadths] wide.
A partition of reeds [around a vineyard], if between one reed and another there is less than three handbreadths through which a kid can enter [pass through], it is [considered] a partition. A fence [around a vineyard] that has been breached, up to ten cubits is considered an entrance [and he may plant seeds next to it]. [If the breach is] greater than this [ten cubits], it is forbidden [to sow right] opposite the breach. If there are several breaches in the fence [none greater than ten cubits], if the [total area] still standing is greater than the [total area] which has been breached it is permitted, but if the [total area] of that which has been breached is greater than the [total area] of that which is standing, it is forbidden [to sow right] opposite the breach.  
If one plants a row of five vines, Beit Shammai says, it is [considered] a vineyard, and Beit Hillel says, it is not considered a  vineyard unless there are two rows.Therefore, if one sows [within the] four cubits [of working space], Beit Shammai say, he has rendered one row forbidden [as <i>kilayim</i>], and Beit Hillel say, he has rendered two rows forbidden [as <i>kilayim</i>].
If one plants two [vines] opposite two [vines] and one [vine] protrudes like a tail, it is [considered] a vineyard. [If one planted] two [vines] opposite two [vines] and one [vine] between [two of the vines], or two [vines] opposite two [vines], and one in the center, it is not [considered] a vineyard until there are two [vines] opposite two [vines] and one [vine] protrudes like a tail. 
If one plants one row [of vines] on his land and one row on his neighbor's [adjoining land], and [even if] a private path or a public path is in the middle [between he two row], or a fence that is lower than ten handbreadths high, they combine. [If the fence is] higher that ten handbreadths high they do not combine.  Rabbi Yehudah says, If he intertwines them [the vines] above [the fence] they combine [even if the fence is higher that ten handbreadths].
If one plants two rows of vines,  if there is not eight cubits between them [the vines] he may not bring [sow] seeds there. If there were three [rows of vines],  if there is not sixteen cubits between one row and the other, he may not bring [sow] seeds there. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says in the name of Chanina ben Chachinai, Even if the middle one [row] was laid waste, and there are not  sixteen cubits between one row and the other, he may not bring [sow] seeds there, for had he, originally planted [just] these [two rows] it would have been permitted [to sow between them] if there were eight cubits [between them]. 
If one plants his vineyard sixteen cubits apart [between the rows] he may bring [sow] seeds there. Rabbi  Yehudah said, There was an incident in [the city of] Tzalmon, where one planted his vineyard sixteen cubits apart, and [one year] he turned the branches of two rows towards one side and sowed the [empty] plowed ground. The next year he turned the branches towards the other side and sowed the fallow ground,  and the matter was brought before the Sages, and they permitted it. Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon say, [even] if one plants his  vineyard [only] eight cubits [apart] it is permitted.
