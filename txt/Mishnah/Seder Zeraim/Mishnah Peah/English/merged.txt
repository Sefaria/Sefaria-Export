Chapter 1

These are the things that have no measure: The <i>Peah</i> [corner of the field that must be given to the poor], the <i>Bikurim</i> [first-fruits that must be given to the <i>Kohen</i>], the appearance-sacrifice [at the Temple in Jerusalem on Pilgrimage Festivals], acts of kindness, and the study of the <i>Torah</i>.  These are things the fruits of which a man enjoys in this world, while the principal remains for him in the World to Come: Honoring father and mother, acts of kindness, and bringing peace between a man and his fellow. But the study of <i>Torah</i> is equal to them all.
One should not make the <i>Peah</i> less than one-sixtieth [of the entire crop]. And although they [the Rabbis] say that there is no definite amount given for <i>Peah</i>, it is all based upon the size of the field and upon the number of poor [who will be collecting it] and upon the abundance of the crop.
One may give <i>Peah</i> from the beginning of the field or from its middle. Rabbi Shimon says: only if one gives the full measure at the end. Rabbi Yehudah says: if one has left even one stalk [at the end], he adjoins to it [what he has left to the beginning or middle, and it becomes <i>Pe'ah</i>], if not, he has merely made it owner-less.
They made a rule about <i>Peah</i>: all which is food and which is guarded and grows from the ground and collected in one crop and stored for preservation is obligated in <i>Peah</i>. And the grain and legumes are in this rule.
And as for the trees: the sumac, the carobs, the nuts, the almonds, the grapevines, the pomegranates, the olives, and the dates are obligated in <i>Peah</i>.
He may always give of <i>Peah</i> and it is exempt from the tithes until he smoothes out [the pile of produce]. And he may declare his produce ownerless and it is exempt from tithes until he smoothes out [the pile of produce]. And he may feed it to cattle and to a beast and to birds and it is exempt from tithes until he smoothes out [the pile of produce].  And he may take it from the granary and sow it and it is exempt from tithes until he smoothes out [the pile of produce], according to the words of Rabbi Akiva. If a priest and a Levite bought a granary, the tithes are theirs until it is smoothed out. One who dedicates [produce to the Temple] and redeems [produce from being dedicated to the Temple] is obligated in tithes until the treasurer smoothes out [the pile].

Chapter 2

And these divide the <i>Peah</i> [corner of the field that must be given to the poor]: a river, a pond, a private road, a public road, a public path, a private path that is permanent during summer and winter days, uncultivated land, plowed land, and a different crop. One who harvests for the purpose of animal food creates a division, according to the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, "He does not create a division unless he plowed."
[Regarding] an irrigation ditch that one cannot harvest [both sides] as if [they were] one, Rabbi Yehuda says, “This is a division.” And all the hills that are hoed with a hoe, even though cattle cannot cross [them] with their [plowing] equipment, he gives <i>Peah</i> for the whole [field, without dividing it].
All of these divide for seed crops, and do not divide for trees except for a fence. If there were branches that were intermingling [over the fence], this is not a division, but rather one gives <i>Peah</i> for everything.
And for carob trees, all that are in sight of one another. Rabban Gamliel said, “It was customary in my father’s house to give one  <i>Peah</i> for the olive trees on each side, and for the carob trees [to give once for] all that are in sight of one another.” Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Tzadok says in his name, “Even for the carob trees that they had in the entire city.”
If one sows his field with one species, even though he makes it into two granaries, he gives one <i>Peah</i>. If he sows it with two species, even though he makes them into one granary, he gives two <i>Peah</i>s. If he sows his field with two species of wheat; if he makes them into one granary, he gives one <i>Peah</i>. If two granaries, two <i>Peah</i>s.
It happened that Rabbi Shimon the man of Mitzpah sowed [and came] before Rabban Gamliel, and they went up to the Chamber of Hewn Stone [meeting place of the Great Sanhedrin] and they asked.  Nachum the clerk said, "I have received it from Rabbi Meyasha, who received it from [his] father, who received it from the <i>Zugot</i> [pairs of Rabbinic leaders], who received it from the Prophets, [as a] Law of Moshe from Sinai: in [a case of] one who sows his field with two kinds of wheat; if he makes them into one granary, he gives one <i>Peah</i>. If two granaries, two <i>Peah</i>s."
If a field was harvested by non-Jews, harvested by robbers, chewed up by ants, or broken by wind or an animal, it is exempt [from <i>Peah</i>]. If he [the owner] harvested half and [then] robbers harvested half, it is exempt since the obligation of <i>Peah</i> applies only regarding standing grain.
If robbers harvested half, and [then] he [the owner] harvested half, he gives <i>Peah</i> from what he harvested. If he harvested half and sells [the other] half, the buyer gives <i>Peah</i> for all [the field]. If he harvested half and dedicated [the other] half [to the Temple], the one who redeems it from the treasurer gives <i>Peah</i> for all [the field].

Chapter 3

For rectangular beds of grain that are between olive trees, the school of Shammai says, “[Give] <i>Pe'ah</i> [corner of the field that must be given to the poor] from each and every one.” The school of Hillel says, “[Give] from one for all of them.” And they acknowledge that if the start of the rows are mixed together, one gives <i>Pe'ah</i> from one for all of them.
If one harvests [the ripe stalks of] his field and leaves over moist stalks, Rabbi Akiva says, “Give <i>Pe'ah</i> from each and every one.” And the Sages say, “Give <i>Pe'ah</i> from one for all of them.” And the Sages acknowledge to R’ Akiva in [a case of] one who sows dill or mustard in three places, that he gives <i>Pe'ah</i> from each and every one.
One that separates moist onions [to take] to the market while maintaining the dry ones for the granary, gives <i>Pe'ah</i> for both individually. And thus it is for beans, and thus it is for a vineyard. One who thins out [the field] gives from the remnant for the remainder, and one who separates from one particular area gives from the remnant for the whole.
The [seed] onions are obligated in <i>Pe'ah</i>. And Rabbi Yosi exempts. For the rectangular beds of onions that are between other vegetables, Rabbi Yosi says, “<i>Pe'ah</i> must be taken from each and every one.” And the Sages say, “From one for all of them.”
When brothers divide [inherited land], they give two <i>Pe'ah</i>s. If they return and become partners, they give one <i>Pe'ah</i>. Two that buy a tree give one <i>Pe'ah</i>. If this one takes the north and that one takes the south, this one gives a corner for himself and that one gives a corner for himself. One who sells the stems of trees in his field must give <i>Pe'ah</i> for each and every one. Rabbi Yehuda said, “When is this? In a time when the field owner did not retain anything, but if something is retained for the field owner, he gives <i>Pe'ah</i> for everything.”
Rabbi Eliezer says, “Land [the size of] the quarter measurement is obligated in <i>Pe'ah</i>.” Rabbi Yehoshua says, “That which makes  two <i>Se'ah</i> [a specific unit of volume].” Rabbi Tarfon says, “Six by six handbreadths”. Rabbi Yehudah ben B’teirah says, “[The size that would be needed] in order to harvest and repeat.” And the law is according to his words. Rabbi Akiva says, “Any size of land is obligated in <i>Pe'ah</i>, and in <i>Bikurim</i> [first fruits that must be given to the <i>Kohen</i>], and a <i>Pruzbul</i> [court exemption from the Sabbatical year expiration of a loan] may be written for it, and movable property can be bought along with it using money, contract, or physical acquisition.
If a dying man writes his property [to another], if he leaves some land over [for himself], his gift is a gift. If he does not leave any land over, his gift is not a gift. If he writes his property to his children, and writes to his wife some land, she has lost her marriage contract. Rabbi Yosi says, “If she accepts it, even though it wasn’t written to her, she has lost her marriage contract.”
If one writes his property to his slave, he goes out a freeman. If he leaves some land over, he does not go out as a freeman. Rabbi Shimon says, “He is always a freeman unless he says: ‘Indeed, all my property is given to so-and-so, my slave, except for one out of a multitude that is among them.’”

Chapter 4

<i>Pe'ah</i> [corner of the field that is given to the poor] is given while connected to the ground. For vines and for palm trees, the <i>Ba'al HaBayit</i> [property owner] brings down and distributes [them] for the poor. Rabbi Shimon says, “Also for smooth nut trees.” Even if ninety-nine say to distribute and one says to plunder [i.e. to give it to the first to grab it], to this one we listen for he has spoken as is the law.
For vines and palm trees, this is not so. Even if ninety-nine say to plunder and one says to distribute, to this one we listen for he has spoken as is the law.
If one took some of the <i>Pe'ah</i> and threw it on the rest, there is nothing for him in it. Even if he falls upon it, and spreads his shawl on it, it is transferred from him. And thus it is for <i>Leket</i> [fallen gleanings given to the poor], and thus it is for the sheaf of <i>Shikhecha</i> [forgotten sheaves given to the poor].
<i>Pe'ah</i> cannot be harvested with a scythe, and cannot be uprooted with a spade, so that a man will not hit his friend.
Three times a day must a field be made accessible to the poor; in the morning, at midday, and in the afternoon. Rabban Gamliel says, “They didn’t say this except for the purpose that [the begging times] should not be reduced.” Rabbi Akiva says, “They didn’t say this except for the purpose that [the begging times] shouldn’t increase.” Of those that were in Beth Nameir, they would gather that which was on [spanned by] the rope and give <i>Pe'ah</i> from each and every furrow.
A non-Jew that harvests his field and afterwards becomes a convert [to Judaism] is exempt from [the obligation of giving] <i>Leket</i> and from <i>Shikhecha</i> and from <i>Pe'ah</i>. Rabbi Yehuda obligates him in <i>Shikhecha</i>, since <i>Shikhecha</i> only applies at the time of bringing home [the sheaves].
One who dedicated standing crop [to the Temple] and redeemed it is obligated [to give <i>Pe'ah</i>]. One who dedicated cut sheaves and redeemed them is obligated. [One who] dedicated standing crop and redeemed [after it became] cut sheaves is exempt, for at the time that it would have become obligated, it was exempt.
Similarly, if one dedicates his fruit before the season to tithe them comes, and he redeems them, they are obligated.  If the season to tithe them comes and he redeems them, they are obligated.  If he dedicated them before they were ripe and they ripened [while possessed] by the treasurer, and afterwards he redeemed them, they are exempt, for in the hour that they would have become obligated, they were exempt.
He who collects <i>Pe'ah</i> and says: “Behold, this is for such-and-such poor man”--Rabbi Eliezer says, “He acquired it for him.” And the Sages say, “He must give it to the first poor person that he finds.” The <i>Leket</i>, the <i>Shikhecha</i>, and the <i>Pe'ah</i> of a non-Jew are obligated in tithes unless he abandons them.
What is <i>Leket</i>? That which drops in the hour of harvesting.  If he was harvesting, and harvested a handful or plucked a fistful, and a thorn pricked him and [the handful or fistful] falls from his hand to the earth, behold it belongs to the <i>Ba'al HaBayit</i>. [If it fell] from inside his hand or from inside the scythe [blade, it belongs] to the poor. [If from] outside his hand, or the back of the scythe, it belongs to the <i>Ba'al HaBayit</i>. [If it is] from the tip of the hand or the tip of the scythe, Rabbi Yishmael says, “It is for the poor.” Rabbi Akiva says, “It is for the <i>Ba'al HaBayit</i>.”
[Anything in] ant-holes that are within a standing crop, behold this belongs to the <i>Ba'al HaBayit</i>. If this is after the harvesters [have harvested that crop], the upper parts belong to the poor and the lower parts belong to the <i>Ba'al HaBayit</i>. R’ Meir says, “Everything is for the poor, since that which is a doubtful <i>Leket</i> is considered <i>Leket</i>.”

Chapter 5

[For] a stack of grain underneath which <i>Leket</i> [fallen gleanings given to the poor] was not collected, everything touching the ground is for the poor. If wind scatters the sheaves, he measures how much <i>Leket</i> it can make and gives [that amount] to the poor. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, “Give to the poor the amount that [normally] falls.”
If during the harvest an ear of grain touches the standing crop; if it can be harvested with the standing crop, it belongs to the <i>Ba'al HaBayit</i> [property owner]. And if not, it belongs to the poor. If an ear of grain that is <i>Leket</i> is intermixed in a stack, one ear must be tithed and given to him [the poor man]. Rabbi Eliezer said, “And how does this poor person exchange something that did not come into his possession? Rather, grant him the entire stack and tithe one ear and give it to him."
One may not use an irrigating wheel; these are the words of R’ Meir. And the Sages permit it, because it is possible.
If a <i>Ba'al HaBayit</i> was passing from one place to another place, and needs to take <i>Leket</i>, <i>Shikhecha</i> [forgotten sheaves given to the poor], or <i>Pe'ah</i> [corner of a field that must be given to the poor] or <i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> [lit. "second tithe", which must eaten in Jerusalem] he may take and when he returns to his house pay [for them]; these are the words of R’ Eliezer. And the Sages say, “He was poor at that time.”
Someone who exchanges with the poor, what is his is exempt and what is the poor person's is obligated [in tithes]. If two received a field as sharecroppers, one may give the other a poor-man's tithe from his portion, and that other may give him a poor-man's tithe tithe from his portion. Someone who contracts for a field to harvest is forbidden in [taking] <i>Leket</i>, <i>Shikhecha</i>, <i>Pe'ah</i>, and <i>Ma'aser Sheni</i>. Rabbi Yehuda said, “When? At a time that he contracts for a half, a third, or a fourth [of the harvest]. But if he said to him, a third of what you contract for is yours, [then] he is permitted in [taking] <i>Leket</i>, <i>Shikhecha</i>, and <i>Pe'ah</i> and forbidden in <i>Ma'aser Sheni</i>.”
If someone sells his field, the seller is permitted and the buyer is forbidden. A man may not hire the worker on the condition that his [the worker's] son may collect after him. One who does not allow the poor to glean, or who allows one and not another, or who helps one of them, indeed he is stealing from the poor, about which is said, “Do not withdraw the border of those who go up [to glean" - play on words from Proverbs 22:28].
A sheaf that is forgotten by workers and not forgotten by the <i>Ba'al HaBayit</i>, or that is forgotten by the <i>Ba'al HaBayit</i> and not forgotten by the workers, or if the poor stood before him, or if it was covered by straw, indeed this is not <i>Shikhecha</i>.
One who gathers sheaves into hat-shaped piles or <i>Kusmesa'ot</i>  [translation unknown] piles or circular piles, these are not [subject to] <i>Shikhecha</i>, but if they are taken from there to the granary, are [subject to] <i>Shikhecha</i>. If the sheaves are in a stack, they are [subject to] <i>Shikhecha</i>. If these are taken to the granary, they are not [subject to] <i>Shikhecha</i>. This is the general rule: Anytime the sheaves are in a place that work is completed with them, they are [subject to] <i>Shikhecha</i>, but if they are taken to the granary, they are not [subject to] <i>Shikhecha</i>. If it is a place where the work is not completed, they are not [subject to] <i>Shikhecha</i>, if they are taken to the granary, they are [subject to] <i>Shikhecha</i>.

Chapter 6

The school of Shammai says, “Abandoning property to the poor, this is abandonment.” And the school of Hillel says, “It is not abandonment until it has also been abandoned to the rich, like in the Sabbatical year.” If all sheaves of the field are of one Kav, and one sheaf is four Kav and it was forgotten, The school of Shammai says, “It is not [subject to] <i>Shikhecha</i>.” And the school of Hillel says, “It is [subject to] <i>Shikhecha</i>.”
The sheaf that is next to a stone wall, or to a stack, or to cattle, or to vessels, and was forgotten, the school of Shammai says, “It is not <i>Shikhecha</i> [forgotten sheaves given to the poor].” The school of Hillel says, “[It is] <i>Shikhecha</i>.”
The heads of rows, [or] the sheaf that corresponds to it confirms [that it was not forgotten], [or] the sheaf that he grasped to bring to town, and forgot it; they acknowledge that this is not <i>Shikhecha</i>.
And these are the heads of rows: two who started from the middle of the row, this one facing north and that one facing south, and they forgot [some sheaves] before them and after them, the ones that were before them are <i>Shikhecha</i> and the ones that were behind them are not <i>Shikhecha</i>. An individual who starts from the head of the row and forgets [some sheaves] before himself and after himself, that which is before him is not <i>Shikhecha</i> and that which is after him is <i>Shikhecha</i>, since it falls under [the prohibition of] "Do not return." This is the general rule, all that falls under "Do not return" is <i>Shikhecha</i>, and what does not fall under "Do not return" is not <i>Shikhecha</i>.
Two sheaves are <i>Shikhecha</i> and three are not <i>Shikhecha</i>, two piles of olives or carobs are <i>Shikhecha</i> and three are not <i>Shikhecha</i>, two flax-stalks are <i>Shikhecha</i> and three are not <i>Shikhecha</i>, two single grapes are <i>Peret</i> [fallen grapes given to the poor] and three are not <i>Peret</i>, two ears of grain are <i>Leket</i> [fallen gleanings given to the poor] and three are not <i>Leket</i>. These are the words of the school of Hillel. And on all this the school of Shammai said, “Three [belong] to the poor and four to the <i>Ba'al HaBayit</i> [property owner].”
If a sheaf has two <i>Se'ah</i> [a specific unit of volume] and he forgets it, it is not <i>Shikhecha</i>. If two sheaves have two <i>Se'ah</i>, Rabban Gamliel says, “[It belongs] to the <i>Ba'al HaBayit</i>.” And the Sages say, “To the poor.” Rabban Gamliel said, “And does an abundance of sheaves strengthen the power of the <i>Ba'al HaBayit</i> or worsen his power?” They said to him, “Strengthen his power.” He said to them, “And since, at a time when there is one sheaf and it has two <i>Se'ah</i> and he forgot it, it is not <i>Shikhecha</i>, [if he had] two sheaves and they have two <i>Se'ah</i>, is it not the law that they will not be <i>Shikhecha</i>?” They said to him, “No, if you say [a law] regarding one sheaf, which is like a stack, will you say [that law] regarding two sheaves, which are like small bundles?”
If a standing crop has two <i>Se'ah</i> and was forgotten, it is not <i>Shikhecha</i>. If it does not have two <i>Se'ah</i>, but it is fit to make two <i>Se'ah</i>, even if it is stunted, we see it as if it is like good barley.
The standing crop saves the sheaf and the standing crop [from being considered <i>Shikhecha</i>]. The sheaf does not save the sheaf or the standing crop. Which standing crop saves a sheaf? Anything that is not <i>Shikhecha</i>, even a single stalk.
A <i>Se'ah</i> of uprooted grain and a <i>Se'ah</i> of grain that is not uprooted, and thus for trees, garlic, and onions, do not combine to make two <i>Se'ah</i>, but rather they are for the poor. Rabbi Yosi says, “If property of the poor man comes between them, they do not combine, and if not, indeed these combine.”
Grain that is intended for animal food or for binding, and thus for bundles of garlic or bundles of garlic and onion, these are not [subject to the law of] <i>Shikhecha</i>. And anything that is concealed in the land, like <i>Arum palaestinum</i> and garlic and onions, Rabbi Yehuda says, “They are not [subject to] <i>Shikhecha</i>.” And the Sages say, “They are [subject to] <i>Shikhecha</i>.”
He who harvests at night and he who makes sheaves, and also a blind person, they are [subject to] <i>Shikhecha</i>. And if one intended to take only the coarsest, he is [subject to] <i>Shikhecha</i>. If he said, “Indeed, I am harvesting on the condition that what I forget I will take,” he is [subject to] <i>Shikhecha</i>.

Chapter 7

Every olive tree that has a name in the field, even the olive tree of Netufah in its time, and he forgets it, it is not [subject to] <i>Shikhecha</i> [forgotten sheaves given to the poor]. On what did they say this? On that which is known for its name or for its produce or for its place. “For its name” – that it was [known to be] rich or from [the town of] Beishan. "For its produce" --that it produces a great amount. “For its place” – that it stands near a wine press or near a hole [in a fence]. And for the rest of all the olive trees, if one forgets two, they are [subject to] <i>Shikhecha</i>, but if three, they are not [subject to] <i>Shikhecha</i>. Rabbi Yosi says, “Olives are not [subject to] <i>Shikhecha</i>.”
An olive tree that was found standing between three rows of two rectangles [of grain], and he forgets it, it is not [subject to] <i>Shikhecha</i>. An olive tree that has two <i>Se'ah</i> [a specific unit of volume] in it, and he forgets it, it is not [subject to] <i>Shikhecha</i>. On what did they say this? At a time when he did not start [picking] it, but if he started, even the olive tree of Netufah in its time, and he forgets it, it is [subject to] <i>Shikhecha</i>. Any time that [the law of <i>Shikhecha</i>] applies under it [the tree], it applies at the top of it. Rabbi Meir says, “This is only when the produce searcher has given up.”
What is <i>Peret</i>? What falls at the time of the grape harvest. If one was harvesting grapes, and he was pricked by the cluster or was entangled in leaves, and [grapes] fell from his hand to the earth and were separated into single grapes, indeed this belongs to the <i>Ba'al HaBayit</i> [property owner]. If one leaves a basket under the vine, at the time that he harvests grapes, indeed he is stealing from the poor. On this it is said, “Do not withdraw the border of those who go up [to glean].” (play on words from Proverbs 22:28)
What is <i>Olelet</i>? All that doesn’t have a shoulder and not a drop [but rather is entirely attached to the main stem]. If there is a shoulder or a drop, it belongs to the <i>Ba'al HaBayit</i>. If there is a doubt, it belongs to the poor. An <i>Olelet</i> that is attached to the knee [the joint between branches or the stem and the trunk]; if it is plucked with the grape cluster, indeed it belongs to the <i>Ba'al HaBayit</i>. And if not, indeed it belongs to the poor. For a single grape, Rabbi Yehuda says, “It is a cluster.” And the Sages say, “It is an <i>Olelet</i>.”
One who prunes the vines may prune the ones for the poor just as he prunes his own. These are the words of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says, “He has permission for his own, but does not have permission for those of the poor.”
For a vineyard in its fourth [year, the produce of which must be eaten in Jerusalem, see Leviticus 19:23-25], the school of Shammai says, “It does not have a [penalty of a] fifth, and it does not require burning." And the school of Hillel says, “It has [them].” The school of Shammai says, “It has [the obligation of] <i>Peret</i> and it has [the obligation of] <i>Olelet</i>, and the poor redeem for themselves.” And the school of Hillel says, “It is all for the wine press.”
If a vineyard consists entirely of <i>Olelot</i>, Rabbi Eliezer says, “It is for the <i>Ba'al HaBayit</i>.” Rabbi Akiva says, “It is for the poor.” Rabbi Eliezer said, “'When you harvest, do not take the <i>Olelot</i>.' (Deuteronomy 24:21) If you do not harvest, where do the <i>Olelet</i> come from?” Rabbi Akiva said to him, “And [from] your vineyard you should not take <i>Olelot</i> (Leviticus 19:10)", [teaches that] even if it is entirely <i>Olelot</i>. If so, why does it say ‘When you harvest, do not take the <i>Olelot</i>'? The poor have no part in the <i>Olelot</i> before the harvest.”
One who dedicates his vineyard, if it was not yet known to him which were the <i>Olelot</i>, the <i>Olelot</i> are not for the poor. If it was known to him which were the <i>Olelot</i>, the <i>Olelot</i> are for the poor. Rabbi Yosi says, “He gives the value of the [added] growth to the Temple treasury.” What is considered <i>Shikhecha</i> on a trellis? Anything that he is unable to take by stretching out his arm. And in runners, when he passes from it.

Chapter 8

From when is everyone permitted in [taking] <i>Leket</i> [fallen gleanings given to the poor]? When the weakest of the poor have [come and] gone. And when for <i>Peret</i> [fallen grapes given to the poor] and <i>Olelot</i> [grapes that do not grow in clusters and are given to the poor]? From when the poor were able to go through the vineyard and come back. And when for olive trees? When the second rain has come. Rabbi Yehuda said, “And are there not those who do not harvest their olive trees until after the second rain? Rather, when the poor go out, and do not bring back four <i>Issarot</i> worth [specific unit of money].”
[Poor] people are trusted with the <i>Leket</i> and the <i>Shikhecha</i>, and the <i>Pe'ah</i> [corner of the field that must be given to the poor] in their time, and with the poor-man's tithe all year long. And a Levite is trusted forever. And we do not trust except in matters that people are accustomed to.
[Poor] people are trusted concerning wheat, but they are not trusted concerning flour and not concerning bread. [Poor] people are trusted concerning the barley of rice, but not trusted concerning it [the rice itself], regardless of whether it is raw or cooked. [Poor] people are trusted concerning beans, but not trusted concerning grits, regardless of whether they are raw or cooked. [Poor] people are trusted concerning oil, to say that it is poor-man's tithes, but not trusted to say that it is <i>Nikuf</i> [olives declared ownerless by the owner].
[Poor] people are trusted concerning raw vegetables but not believed concerning cooked ones, unless he had a small thing, because it is common that the <i>Ba'al HaBayit</i> [property owner] takes it out from his stew pot.
One must not reduce the poor’s portion of the granary below half a <i>Kav</i> [specific unit of volume] of wheat and a <i>Kav</i> of barley. R’ Meir says, "Half a <i>Kav</i>". A <i>Kav</i> and a half of kasha, and a Kav of dried figs or a <i>Maneh</i> [specific unit of volume] of figs. R’ Akiva says, "A <i>Pras</i> [half a <i>Maneh</i>].” Half a <i>Log</i> [one fourth of a <i>Kav</i>] of wine. R’ Akiva says, “A fourth.” A fourth of a <i>Log</i> of oil. R’ Akiva says, “An eighth [of that].” And for the rest of the produce, Abba Shmuel said, “Enough that he can sell it and buy food for two meals.”
This measure applies to priests and Levites and Israelites. If one wants to save some, he takes half and gives half. If he has a small amount, he gives it before them, and they divide it between themselves.
One must not reduce the due of the poor that wander from place to place below a loaf that is the price of a  <i>Pundion</i>, when 4 <i>Se'ah</i> cost a <i>Sela</i>. If he spends the night, give him the support to spend the night. If he stays for Shabbat, give him food for 3 meals. Someone who has only 2 meals must not take from the soup kitchen. If he has food for 14 meals, he must not take from the money box. And the money box is brought around by two people and divided up by three people.
Someone who has 200 <i>Zuz</i> does not take the <i>Leket</i>, <i>Shikhecha</i>, <i>Pe'ah</i>, and poor-man's tithes. If he has a <i>Dinar</i> less than 200, even if he is given 1000 at once, indeed he may take. If they are pledged to his creditor, or his wife’s marriage contract, indeed he may take. He is not obligated to sell his house or his clothes.
Someone who has 50 <i>Zuz</i>, and he uses them for business, indeed he may not take. And all who don’t need to take, but take anyway, he will not disappear from the world until he will be made dependant on mankind. And all who need to take and don’t take, he will not die from old age until he will provide for others from his portion. And on this, the verse says, “Blessed is the man that relies on G-d, and G-d will be his security.” (Jeremiah 17:7) And so for a judge who judges in absolute truth. And he that is not lame, nor blind, nor limp, yet he makes himself up as one of these, he will not die of old age until he is like one of these, as it says, “Justice, justice shall you pursue.” (Deuteronomy 16:20) And every judge that takes a bribe and diverts the law, he will not die of old age until his eyes have dimmed, as it says, “And you shall not take a bribe, because a bribe blinds those that can see and understand, etc.” (Exodus 23:8)
