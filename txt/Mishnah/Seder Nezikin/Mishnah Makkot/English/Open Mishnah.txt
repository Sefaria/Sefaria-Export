Mishnah Makkot



Chapter 1



Chapter 2



Chapter 3






One who tatoos: If he writes without engraving, or he engraves without writing, he is not liable for lashes, until he writes and engraves with ink or pigment or anything that leaves an impression. Rebbi Shimon ben Yehudah said in the name of Rebbi Shimon [bar Yochai]: He is not liable until he writes a name [of idolatry] there. As it says (Vayikra 19): "Do not tatoo yourself, for I am G-d."
A Nazirite who drinks wine every day is only liable for one.  If they said to him, "Don't drink!  Don't drink!" and he drank, he is liable for each and every one.

There is [the possibility that one could] plow only one furrow and become liable [on that account] for eight prohibited acts: [This is the case where] one  (1) plows with an ox and a donkey [yoked together] (in violation of Deuteronomy 22:10) (2 and 3) that are [two animals] dedicated to the sanctuary, (4) [plowing] mixed seeds [sown] in a vineyard (in violation of Deuteronomy 22:9), (5) during a Sabbatical year (in violation of Leviticus 25:4), (6) on a Festival-day (in violation of, for example, Leviticus 23:7), (7) [when the plower is] a priest (in violation of Leviticus 21:1) (8) and a Nazirite (in violation of Numbers 6:6) plowing in a contaminated place.   Chananya ben Chachinai says: Also he may have been wearing [while plowing] a garment of mixed [wool and linen] fabrics (in violation of Leviticus 19:19 and Deuteronomy 22:11).  They said to him: This is not in the same category [as the other violations].  He said to them: Neither is the Nazirite in the same category [as the other violations].
