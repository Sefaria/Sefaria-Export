Chapter 1

Moshe received the Torah from Sinai, and transmitted it to Yehoshua, and Yehoshua to the Elders, and the Elders to the Prophets, and the Prophets transmitted it to the Men of the Great Assembly. They said three things: Be deliberate in judgment, and establish many students, and make a fence for the Torah.
Shimon the Righteous was of the last of the Great Assembly. He would say: On three things the world stands–on the Torah, on the service, and on acts of kindness.
Antigenos, man of Sokho, received from Shimon the Righteous. He would say: Do not be as slaves who are serving the master in order to receive a reward, rather be as servants who are serving the master not in order to receive a reward; and may the fear of Heavens be upon you.
Yosei ben Yoezer, man of Tsreida, and Yosei ben Yochanan, man of Jerusalem, received from him. Yosei ben Yoezer says: May your house be a meeting house for Sages, and be dirty in the dust of their feet, and be drinking with thirst their words.
Yosei ben Yochanan, man of Jerusalem, says: May your house be open wide, and may the poor be members of your household, and do not increase conversation with the woman. With his wife, they said, all the more so with the wife of his friend. From here the Sages said: Any time that a man increases conversation with the woman — He causes evil to himself, and neglects the words of Torah, and in his end he inherits Geihinam.
Yehoshua ben Perachiah and Nitai of Arbel received from them. Yehoshua ben Perachia says: Make for yourself a Rabbi, acquire for yourself a friend, and judge every person as meritorious.
Nitai of Arbel says: Distance [yourself] from a bad neighbor, do not befriend a wicked person, and do not despair of punishment.
Yehudah ben Tabai and Shimon ben Shatach received from them. Yehudah ben Tabai says: Do not make yourself like the legal advisers, and when the litigants are before you, they should be in your eyes as criminals, and when they are excused from before you, they should be in your eyes as meritorious, when they have accepted the judgment.
Shimon ben Shatach says: Examine the witnesses thoroughly, but be careful with your words, lest from them they learn to lie.
Shemayah and Avtalyon received from them. Shemayah says: Love the work, and hate the mastery, and do not become familiar with the government.
Avtalyon says: Sages, be careful with your words, lest you become obligated in an obligation of exile and are exiled to the place of evil waters, and the students who follow after you will drink, and thus the name of the Heavens is profaned.
Hillel and Shammai received from them. Hillel says: Be of the disciples of Aharon, loving peace and pursuing peace, loving the creatures and bringing them closer to Torah.
He would say: Spread a name, lose a name. And one who does not increase [knowledge] causes [it] to end. And one who does not study is liable to die. And one who makes use of the crown [of learning] passes away.
He would say: If I am not for me, who will be for me? When I am for myself, what am I? If not now, when?
Shammai says: Make your Torah permanent, say little and do much, and receive every person with a pleasant countenance.
Rabban Gamliel says: Make for yourself a Rabbi, and remove yourself from doubt, and do not often tithe by guesswork.
Shimon, his son, says: All my days I grew up among the Sages, and I did not find anything good for a body but silence. And the exposition [of Torah] is not what is essential, but the action. And whoever increases words brings sin.
Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: On three things the world stands: on judgment, and on truth, and on peace, as it is said (Zachariah 38:16): “Truth and the justice of peace judge in your gates.”

Chapter 2

Rabbi [Yehuda haNasi] said: Which is the right path that a person should choose for himself? Whichever [path] that is [itself] an honor to the person adopting [it], And [on account of which] honor [accrues] to him from [other] people.  And be as careful with a light commandment as with a weighty one, For you do not know the reward given [for the fulfillment] of [the respective] commandments. Also, weigh the loss [that may be sustained through the fulfillment] of a commandment against the reward [that may be obtained] for [fulfilling] it, And [weigh] the gain [that may be obtained through the committing] of a transgression against the loss [that may be sustained] by [committing] it.  Keep your eye on three things, and you will not come into the grip of sin: Know what is above you: An Eye that sees, And an Ear that hears, And all your deeds are written in a book.
Rabban Gamliel the son of Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi said: Excellent is the study of the Torah together with a worldly occupation, For the exertion [expended] in both of them causes sin to be forgotten. And all [study of the] Torah in the absence of a worldly occupation comes to nothing in the end and leads to sin.  And all who work for the community, let them work for the [sake of the] name of Heaven, For the merit of the [community’s] ancestors sustains them, And their [ancestors’] righteousness will endure forever. And as for you [who work for the community], [God says:] I credit you with a great reward, as if you [yourselves] had [actually] done [everything on your own].
Be careful about the authorities who approach a man only when they need him. They seem like good friends in good times, but they don't stay for him in time of his trouble.
He would say: Make His will like your will, in order that He may  make your will like His. Nullify your will before His, in order that the wills of others may be nullified before your will. Hillel says: Do not separate from the community, do not trust in yourself until the day of your death, do not judge your fellow until you have reached his place, and do not say something that should not be heard, for in the end it will be heard, and do not say, "When I become free I will learn" - lest you never become free.
He would say: a brute does not fear sin, an <i>Am Ha'aretz</i> [one who is lax in observing tithes and purity laws] cannot be devout, one who is bashful cannot learn, one who is impatient cannot teach, not every one who increases in commerce becomes wise, and in a place where there are no men strive to be a man.
He also saw one skull that was floating on the surface of the water. He said (to her), "Because you drowned, they drowned you. And the end of those who drowned you will be being drowned."
He would say: Increase flesh, increase worms; increase possessions, increase worry; increase women, increase witchcraft; increase maid-servants, increase lewdness; increase man-servants, increase robbery. Increase Torah, increase life; increase schooling, increase wisdom; increase counsel, increase understanding; increase charity, increase peace. One who acquired a good name, acquired for himself; one who acquired for himself words of Torah, acquired for himself life of the world to come.
Rabban Yochanan Ben Zakkai received from Hillel and Shammai. He would say: If you learned much Torah, do not attribute too much value to yourself, since for this you were created. Rabban Yochanan Ben Zakkai had five students, and these are them: Rabbi Eliezer Ben Hurkanus, Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Chananiah, Rabbi Yossei the priest, Rabbi Shimon Ben Netanel, and Rabbi Elazar Ben Arakh. He would list their praises: Rabbi Eliezer Ben Hurkanus is a cemented cistern that does not lose a drop; Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Chananiah, praiseworthy is she who bore him; Rabbi Yossei the priest is pious; Rabbi Shimon Ben Netanel fears sin; Rabbi Elazar Ben Arakh is the intensifying spring. He would say, if all of the Sages of Israel would be on the side of a scale and Eliezer Ben Hurkanus were on the second side, he would outweigh all of them. Abba Shaul says in his name, if all of the Sages of Israel would be on the side of a scale and even Rabbi Eliezer Ben Hurkanus were with them, and Rabbi Elazar Ben Arakh were on the second side, he would outweigh all of them.
He said to them: go out and see which is the straight path for a person to follow. Rabbi Eliezer says: a good eye. Rabbi Yehoshua says: a good friend. Rabbi Yose says: a good neighbor. Rabbi Shimon says: one who sees the newborn. Rabbi Elazar says: a good heart. He said to them: I see the words of Elazar ben Arach more than your words, since his words encapsulate your words. He said to them: go out and see which is the evil path for a person to avoid. Rabbi Eliezer says: a bad eye. Rabbi Yehoshua says: a bad friend. Rabbi Yose says: a bad neighbor. Rabbi Shimon says: one who borrows and does not pay back. One who borrows from a person is like one who borrows from the Holy one, Blessed be He, as it says: "the wicked borrows and does not pay; but the righteous is gracious and gives" (Psalms 37:21). Rabbi Elazar says: a bad heart. He said to them: I see the words of Elazar ben Arach more than your words, since his words encapsulate your words.
Each of them said three things. Rabbi Eliezer says: The honor of your fellow should be as precious to you as your own, and do not be angered easily, and repent one day before your death, and be warmed by the light of the Sages, but be careful of their coals that you will not be burned, for their bite is the bite of a fox and their sting is the sting of a scorpion and their hiss is the hiss of a serpent, and all their words are like coals of fire.
Rabbi Yehoshua says: The evil eye, and the evil inclination, and hatred of the creations remove a person from the world.
Rabbi Yosei says: The property of your friend should be as precious to you as your own. Prepare yourself to study Torah, for it is not an inheritance for you. And all your deeds should be for the sake of Heaven.
Rabbi Shimon says: Be careful in the reciting of the <i>Shema</i> and the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i>. When you pray, do not make your prayers routine, but rather a plea for mercy and supplications before God, as is written (Joel 2:13), "For [God] is gracious and merciful, He is slow to anger, and abundant with kindness, and relents from punishment." Do not be wicked before yourself.
Rabbi Elazar says: Be diligent in your studies of Torah, know what to respond to a heretic. Know before whom you are laboring. Your employer is trustworthy that He will pay you the reward of your labor.
Rabbi Tarfon says: The day is short and the task is great, and the laborers are lazy, and the wages are much and the master is pressing.
He would say: It is not upon you to finish the work, but you are not free to abandon it. If you studied much Torah, much reward will be given you. Your employer is trustworthy that He will pay you the reward of your labor. And know that the reward for the righteous will be in the time to come. 

Chapter 3

Akavia ben Mahalalel said: Keep in mind three things, And you will not come into the hands of sin:  Know: From where you came, And to where you are going, And before Whom you will have to give an account and a reckoning.  From where did you come? From a putrid drop.  And to where are you going? To a place of dust, worms, and maggots.  And before Whom will you have to give an account and a reckoning? Before the King of kings, the Holy One, Blessed be He.
Rabbi Chanina, the Deputy High Priest, said: Pray for the welfare of the government, For were it not for the fear of it, One person would eat the other alive.  Rabbi Chanania ben Tradyon said: [When] two sit together and there are no words of Torah [spoken] between them, This is a session of scorners, As it is said (in Psalm 1:1): “[Happy is the man who has] not . . . sat in the seat of the scornful.”  But [when] two sit together and there are words of Torah [spoken] between them, The Divine Presence rests with them, As it is said (in Malachi 3:16): “Then they who feared the Lord spoke one with another, and the Lord hearkened and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before Him, for them who feared the Lord and who thought upon His Name.”  [The Mishnah asks:] I have no [Scriptural support for the proposition that the Divine Presence rests with them] except [with] two. From where [is there proof that] even [when there is only] one [person studying Torah], The Holy One, Blessed be He, determines a reward for him? As it is said (in Lamentations 3:28): “Though he sits alone and [meditates] in silence, yet he takes [a reward] to himself.”
Rabbi Shimon says: Three who ate at one table and did not say upon it words of Torah - it is as if they ate from the offerings of corpses, as it is said (quoting Isaiah 28:8): "For all of the tables are full of vomit and feces without the Omnipresent." However, three who ate at one table and said upon it words of Torah - it is as if they ate from the table of the Omnipresent, blessed be He, as it is said (quoting Ezekiel 41:22): "And he said to me, this is the table that is before Hashem."
Rabbi Hanina the son of Hachinai says: He who stays awake at night, and wanders on a solitary road, and empties his heart for folly, is deemed by Scripture to be as if he was guilty [of an offense punishable by the forfeiture] of his life.
R. Nechunya b. Hakanah said: Anyone who accepts the yoke of Torah upon himself will have the yoke of kingship and the yoke of "the way of the land" lifted from him.  And anyone who rejects from himself the yoke of Torah will have the yoke of kingship and the yoke of "the way of the land" placed upon him.
Rabbi Chalafta [ben Dosa] of Kfar Chananiah said: [When] ten sit together and occupy themselves with Torah, The Divine Presence rests among them, As it is said (in Psalm 82:1): “God stands in the congregation of God.”  And from where [can one learn that the Divine Presence rests] even [among] five? As it is said (in Amos 9:6): “And He has founded His band upon the earth.”  And from where [can one learn that the Divine Presence rests] even [among] three? As it is said (in Psalm 82:1): “In the midst of the judges He judges.”  And from where [can one learn that the Divine Presence rests] even [with] two? As it is said (in Malachi 3:16): “Then they who feared the Lord spoke one with another, And the Lord hearkened, and heard.”  And from where [can one learn that the Divine Presence rests] even [with] one? As it is said (in Exodus 20:20 (20:21 in NJPS)): “In every place where I cause My Name to be mentioned I will come to you and bless you.”
Rabbi Elazar of Bartuta says: Give Him what is His, for you and yours are His. And so says David, "For all things come of Thee, and of Thine own have we given Thee" (I Chronicles 29:14). Rabbi Shimon says: He who is walking on his way while repeating his studies, and interrupts his studies and says, 'How lovely is this tree! And how lovely is this newly plowed field!' is deemed by Scripture to be as if he was guilty [of an offense punishable by the forfeiture] of his life.
Rabbi Dostai son of Rabbi Yannai in the name of Rabbi Meir says: Anyone who forgets one matter from his studies - Scripture considers him as if he is liable for [forfeiture of] his life, as it is said (Deuteronomy 4:9) "Only guard thyself, and guard thy life diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes saw." One could [suppose this statement applies to] even one whose studies have overpowered him, therefore, the verse says, "and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life" - he is not liable for [forfeiture of] his life until he sits down and [intentionally] removes them from his mind.
Rabbi Chanina son of Dosa says: Anyone whose fear of sin precedes his wisdom, his wisdom endures. And anyone whose wisdom precedes his fear of sin, his wisdom does not endure.  He would [also] say: Anyone whose actions are more plentiful than his wisdom, his wisdom endures. And anyone whose wisdom is more plentiful than his actions, his wisdom does not endure.
He would say: Anyone from whom the spirit of creations receive pleasure, from him the spirit of God finds pleasure. And anyone from whom the spirit of creations do not receive pleasure, from him the spirit of God does not find pleasure. Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinus says: Late morning sleep, midday wine, chatter of children, and sitting in the assembly houses of the <i>Am Ha'aretz</i> [those who are lax in observing tithes and purity laws] remove a person from the world.
Rabbi Elazar of Modi'in says: One who profanes the <i>Kodeshim</i> [sacred material], and desecrates the holidays, and whitens [embarrasses] the face of another in public, and nullifies the covenant of Abraham our father, peace be upon him, and reveals meanings in the Torah that run contrary to the law, even though he has Torah knowledge and good deeds, he has no share in the world to come.
Rabbi Yishmael says: Be yielding to an elder, pleasant to a youth and greet all of mankind with joy.
Rabbi Akiva says: Joking and lightheartedness acclimate toward promiscuity. Tradition is a safeguarding fence around Torah. Tithes are a safeguarding fence around wealth. Vows are a safeguarding fence around abstinence. The safeguarding fence around wisdom: silence.
He would say: Beloved is humankind, since it is created in the image [of God]. A deeper love - it is revealed to him that he is created in the image, as it says (Genesis 9:6) "for in God's image He made humankind." Beloved are Israel, since they are called children of God. A deeper love - it is revealed to them that they are called children to God, as it says (Deuteronomy 14:1) "You are children of the Lord your God." Beloved are Israel, since a precious instrument has been given to them. A deeper love - it is revealed to them that the precious instrument of the world's creation has been given to them, as it says (Proverbs 4:2) "For a good lesson I have given to you; do not forsake my teaching."
Everything is foreseen, and freewill is given, and with goodness the world is judged. And all is in accordance to the majority of the deed.
He would say: Everything is given as collateral, and a net is cast over all of life. The shop is open, and the shopkeeper grants credit, and the accounting ledger is open, and the hand writes, and everyone who wants to borrow can come and borrow, and the collectors go constantly on their daily rounds and exact payment from man - with or without consent, and they have that upon which to rely, and the judgement is true judgement, and everything is prepared for the feast.
...Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah says: If there is no Torah, there is no worldly occupation, if there is no worldly occupation, there is no Torah.  If there is no wisdom, there is no fear of God; if there is no fear of God, there is no wisdom.  If there is no knowledge, there is no understanding; if there is no understanding, there is no knowledge.  If there is no flour, there is no Torah; if there is no Torah, there is no flour.   He used to say: Anyone whose wisdom exceeds his deeds, to what is he compared?  To a tree who branches are many but whose roots are few; then the winds comes and uproots it and turns it upside down; as it is said; "And he shall be like a lonely juniper tree in the wasteland and shall not see when good comes, but shall inhabit the parched places of the wilderness, a salt filled land which is uninhabitable." [Jeremiah 17:6].  But one whose deeds exceed one's wisdom, what is that person like?  Like a tree whose branches are few, but whose roots are many; even if all the winds of the world were to come and blow upon it, they would not move it from its place, as it is said; "He shall be like a tree planted by the waters, which spreads out its roots by the river, and shall not perceive when heat comes, but its leaf shall remain fresh; and it will not be troubled in the year of drought, nor will it cease to bear fruit." [Jeremiah 17:8].
Rabbi Eliezer ben Chisma says: the laws of <i>Kinin</i> [bird offerings] and <i>Niddah</i> [menstruation], these are the body of the laws. Astronomical calculations and <i>Gematria</i> [numerical calculations] are the condiments to wisdom.

Chapter 4

Ben Zoma says:    Who is the wise one? He who learns from all men, as it says, "I have acquired understanding from all my teachers" (Psalms 119:99).    Who is the mighty one? He who conquers his desire, as it says, "slowness to anger is better than a mighty person." (Proverbs 16:32).    Who is the rich one? He who is happy with his lot, as it says, "When you eat [from] the work of your hands, you will be happy, and it will be well with you" (Psalms 128:2). "You will be happy" in this world, and "it will be well with you" in the world to come.    Who is honored? He who honors the created beings, as it says, "For, those who honor Me, I will honor; and those who despise me will be held in little esteem" (I Samuel 2:30).
Ben Azzai says: Run to do an easy mitzvah, and flee from sin; since one mitzvah leads to another mitzvah, and one sin leads to another sin; since the reward for a mitzvah is another mitzvah, and the reward for one sin is another sin.
[Ben Azai] would say: Do not disparage anyone, and do not shun any thing. For you have no man who does not have [his] hour, and you have no thing which does not have a place.
Rabbi Levitas, a man of Yavneh, would say: Be very, very humble in spirit, for the hope of mortal man is with the worms. Rabbi Yochanan, son of Berukah would say: Whoever desecrates the Name of Heaven secretly, his punishment will be public. There is no differentiation between intentional and unintentional when it comes to desecration of God's name.
Rabbi Yishmael [his son] would say: One who studies Torah in order to teach will be given the opportunity to both study and to teach. One who studies in order to practice will be given the opportunity to study, to teach, to observe, and to practice. Rabbi Tzadok used to say: Do not make the Torah into a crown with which to aggrandize yourself, and don't use it as a spade with which to dig into them. Like Hillel used to say: One who makes use of the crown of the Torah will perish. Which infers that any one who exploits the words of the Torah removes themselves from the living world.
Rabbi Yosi said: One who honors the Torah will find themselves honored by others. One who desecrates the Torah will find themselves dishonored by others.
Rabbi Yishmael, his son, said: One who avoids judging spares themselves enmity, theft, and false oaths. One who issues hasty rulings in Torah matters is an imbecile, wicked, and arrogant.
He would say: Don't be a lone judge, for there is no lone judge aside from the One [God]. And don't say,"Accept my opinion," for that is for they to decide; not you.
Rabbi Yonatan said: Anyone who implements the Torah in poverty, in the end will implement it in wealth. And anyone that disregards the Torah in wealth, will in the end disregard it in poverty.
.Rabbi Meir said: Engage minimally in business and fully engage with Torah. Be humble of spirit before everyone. If you neglect the Torah, many reasons for neglecting it will be presented to you. And if you engage laboriously in Torah, God has abundant reward to grant you.
Rabbi Eliezer son of Yaakov said: One who does a single good deed acquires a single defender. One who does a single sin acquires a single prosecutor. Repentance and good deeds are a shield against punishment. Rabbi Yochanan the shoemaker said: Every gathering that is for the sake of Heaven will endure. And every gathering that isn't for the sake of Heven will not endure, in the end.
.Rabbi Elazar son of Shamua said: Let the honor of your students be as your own, and the honor of your fellow be like the reverence of your teacher, and the reverence of your teacher be like the reverence of Heaven.
Rabbi Yehuda said: Be careful when teaching, for your errors in teaching are considered as intentional transgression. Rabbi Shimon said: There are three crowns: the crown of Torah, the crown of priesthood and the crown of the monarchy - but the crown of a good name outweighs them all.
Rabbi Nehorai said: Exile yourself to a place of Torah, and don't say that the Torah will follow you, because it's your colleagues who will make it yours. Don't rely on your lone understanding.
Rabbi Yanai said: We don't have the ability to explain the success of the wicked or the suffering of the righteous. Rabbi Mattia son of Heresh said: Be the first to greet every person. And better a tail to lions than a head to foxes.
Rabbi Jacob used to say: This world is like a hallway to the future world. Prepare yourself in the hallway that you may enter into the banquet hall.
He would say: One hour of repentance and good deeds in this world is better than all the time in the world to come. And one hour of pleasure in the world to come is better than all the time in this world.
Rabbi Shimon the son of Elazar says: Do not try to assuage the anger of your friend in the height of your friend's anger; do not try to comfort your friend when your friend's deceased lies before him; do not question your friend at the time your friend makes a vow; and do not seek to see your friend in the time of your friend's humiliation.
Shmuel the Younger says: (Proverbs 24:17-18) "When your enemy falls, do not be happy, and when he stumbles, let your heart not rejoice. Lest God see and it be bad in His eyes and He turn from him [the enemy] His anger."
Elisha ben Abuya says: One who learns as a child is compared to what? To ink written on new parchment. And one who learns as an elder is compared to what? To ink written on scraped parchment. Rabbi Yose bar Yehuda, man of the town of the Babylonian, says: One who learns from young ones is compared to what? To one who eats unripe grapes and drinks wine from its press. And one who learns from elders is compared to what? To one who eats ripe grapes and drinks aged wine. Rabbi says: Do not look at the jug but rather at what is in it. For there are new jugs full of old, and old that do not have even new within them.
Rabbi Elazar HaKapor says: Envy, lust and honor drive a man from the world.
He would say: Those that are born will die, and those that are dead will live [again], and the living will be judged. [It is necessary] to know, to make known, and to become conscious that He is God, He is the Maker, He is the Creator, He is the Understander, He is the Judge, He is the Witness, He is the Litigant, and He is destined to judge. Blessed Be He, who has before Him no wrong, no forgetfulness, no respect of persons, no taking of bribes, for all is His. And know that everything is according to the reckoning. And do not let yourself count on the netherworld being a place of refuge for you, because against your will you were created, and against your will you were born, and against your will you live, and against your will you die, and against your will you are destined to give account and reckoning before the King of Kings, the Holy One, blessed be he.

Chapter 5

With ten utterances the world was created.  Couldn't it have been created by one? Rather, [it was done this way] in order to punctuate the guilt of the wicked who destroy a world that was created with ten sayings and to add merit to the righteous who sustain a world that was created with ten utterances.
There were ten generations from Adam and Noah, to demonstrate the great extent of [God's] patience, for each one of those generations provoked [God] continually until [God] brought the waters of the flood upon them. There were ten generations from Noah to Abraham, to demonstrate the extent of [God's] patience, for each one of those generations provoked [God] continually, until Abraham, our father, came and received the reward of them all.
With ten tests Abraham, our father, was tested - and he withstood them all; in order to show how great his love was, peace be upon him.
Ten miracles were performed for our ancestors in Egypt, And ten [miracles were performed] at the [Reed] Sea.  (Ten plagues did the Holy One, blessed be He, bring upon the Egyptians in Egypt, And ten [plagues did God bring] at the [Reed] Sea.)  [With] ten trials did our ancestors test the Holy One, Blessed be He, in the Wilderness, As it is said (in Numbers 14:22): “Yet have they tested Me these ten times, And have not hearkened to My voice.”
Ten miracles were performed for our forefathers in the Temple: (1) No woman had a miscarriage from the smell of the sanctified meat. (2) The sanctified meat never became rancid. (3) A fly was never seen in the slaughterhouse. (4) The High Priest never experienced a seminal emission on <i>Yom Kippur</i> [Day of Atonement]. (5) Rain never extinguished the fire of the arranged wood. (6) Wind never won out over the pillar of smoke. (7) The <i>Omer</i> [barley offering], the Two Loaves, and the Shew bread were never found to be invalid. (8) People standing were crowded, but bowing had space. (9) Never did a snake nor scorpion ever cause harm in Jerusalem. (10) A person never said to his fellow, 'It is too crowded for me to sleep overnight in Jerusalem.'
Ten things were created on the eve of the [first] Sabbath at twilight, And these are they: [1] The mouth of the earth [that swallowed Korach in Numbers 16:32 ], [2] The mouth of the well [that accompanied the Israelites in the Wilderness in Numbers 21:17], [3] The mouth of the donkey [that spoke to Balaam in Numbers 22:28–30 ], [4] The rainbow [that served as a covenant after the Flood in Genesis 9:13 ], [5] The manna [that God provided the Israelites in the Wilderness in Exodus 16:4–21 ], [6] The rod [of Moses], [7] The Shamir [worm that helped build the Temple without metal tools], [8] The letters, [9] The writing, and [10] The tablets [of the Ten Commandments].  And some say: Also the destructive spirits, And the burial place of Moses, our teacher, And the ram of Abraham, our father.  And some say: Also the [first human-made] tongs, made with [Divine] tongs.
Seven things [apply] to a fool, and seven to a wise person. A wise person does not speak in front of someone who is greater than him in wisdom, and he does not interrupt his fellow, and he does not hurry to answer; he asks on topic, and he answers according to the law. He talks about the first thing first, and the last thing last. About what he has never heard he says, "I never heard," and he admits to the truth. And the opposite of these [is true] for the fool.
Seven kinds of punishment come to the world for seven categories of sin:  [When] some of [the people] give tithes, and others do not give tithes, A famine from drought comes, And some go hungry, and others have plenty.  [When] they all decide not to give tithes, A famine from tumult and drought comes.  [And when they decide, in addition,] not to set apart the dough [offering], A famine of annihilation comes.   Pestilence comes to the world For [sins] the death penalties [for which are] set forth in the Torah That are not in the hands of a [human] court [to carry out];  And for [violation of the laws governing] the produce of the Sabbatical year.   [The] sword comes to the world For the delay of justice, And for the perversion of justice, And because of those who interpret the Torah counter to the accepted law.
Bad animals come to the world for vain oaths and for desecration of the [Divine] Name. Exile comes to the world for servants of idol worship, and for sexual immorality, and for murder, and for working the land during the Sabbatical year. In four seasons pestilence increases: In the fourth year [of the seven-year Sabbatical cycle], in the seventh year, in the year following the Sabbatical year, and each and every year following the <i>Chag</i> [Festival of Booths]. In the fourth year because of [not giving] the tithe for the poor in the third year. In the seventh year because of [not giving] the tithe for the poor in the sixth year. In the year following the Sabbatical year because of [not making ownerless] the produce of the Sabbatical year. On each and every year following the <i>Chag</i> because of stealing the gifts of the poor.
There are four kinds of people: the one who says "what is mine is mine, and what is yours is yours" -- that's a "beinonit" (intermediate-level person). There are some who say that is the kind of people that were in Sodom. [A second type is one who says] "what is mine is yours, and what is yours is mine" -- [that's an] "am ha'aretz" (uneducated or low-level Jewish person). [A third type is one who says] "what is mine is yours, and what is yours is yours" -- [that's a] "chasid" (righteous person). [A final type is one who says] "what is yours is mine, and what is mine is mine" -- [that's a] "rasha" (wicked person).
There are four kinds of dispositions: [a person who is] easy to anger and easy to please -- his virtue cancels out his flaw. [A person who is] hard to anger but [also] hard to please -- his flaw cancels out his virtue. [A person who is] hard to anger, but easy to please -- [that's a] "chasid" (righteous person). Easy to anger and hard to please -- [that's a] "rasha" (wicked person).
There are four temperaments among men:  Easy to provoke and easy to appease--his loss is canceled by his gain. Hard to provoke and hard to appease--his gain is canceled by his loss. Hard to provoke and easy to appease--he is pious. Easy to provoke and hard to appease--he is wicked.
There are four kinds [of] givers of tzedakah (charity). [One who] wishes to give, but does not [wish for] others to give -- he has an evil eye with respect to others; [one who] wishes for others to give, and he [himself] does not give -- he has an evil eye with respect to himself; [one who] gives and [wishes that] others will give -- [that's a] chasid (righteous person); [one who] does not give and does not [wish that] others will give -- [that's a] rasha (wicked person).
There are four characters among those who attend the House of Study: he who goes but does not practice obtains the reward for going; he who practices but does not go obtains reward for practicing; he who goes and practices is pious; he who neither goes nor practices is wicked.
There are four types who sit before the sages: the sponge, the funnel, the strainer, and the sieve. The sponge - because it absorbs everything; the funnel - because it let's in at one end and out the other; the strainer - because it lets the wine out and retains the sediment; the sieve - because it lets out the bran and retains the fine flour.
Any love that is dependent on something, when that thing perishes, so too does the love. [A love]r  that is not dependent on something, does not ever perish. What's an example of a love that is dependent on something? That's the love of Amnon and Tamar. And a love that is not dependent on something? That's the love of David and Jonathan.
Every argument that is [for the sake of] heaven's name, it is destined to endure. But if it is not [for the sake of] heaven's name -- it is not destined to endure. What [is an example of an argument for the sake of] heaven's name? The argument of Hillel and Shammai. What [is an example of an argument not for the sake of] heaven's name? The argument of Korach and all of his followers.
Whoever causes the many to merit, no transgression comes about on his hands. Whoever causes the many to transgress, his hands will not be enough to perform repentance. Moses merited and caused the many to merit, and merits of the many were credited to him. As it is written (Devarim 33:21), "He did the righteousness of Hashem, and his laws are with Israel". Yeravam transgressed and caused the many to transgress, and their sins were blamed on him. As it is written, (Kings I 15:30) "On the transgressions of Yeravam that he transgressed and made Israel transgress."
One who has these three things is of the students of our father Avraham. [One who has] three other things is of the students of Bilam the wicked. [One who has] a good eye, a low spirit, and a humble soul is of the students of our father Avraham. [One who has] an evil eye, a haughty spirit, and a broad soul is of the students of Bilam the wicked. What is the difference between the students of our father Avraham and the students of Bilam the wicked? The students of our father Avraham eat in this world and inherit the World to Come, as it says (Proverbs 8:21): "That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, and their treasuries I will fill." But the students of Bilam the wicked inherit <i>Geihinam</i> and go down to the pit of destruction, as it says (Psalms 55:24): "But You, God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction; men of blood and deceit will not live out half their days. As for me, I will trust in You."
Yehudah Ben Teima says: Be strong like the leopard, light like the eagle, quick like the gazelle, and mighty like the lion to perform the will of your Father in Heaven. He would say: The strong-faced go to <i>Geihinam</i>, and the shame-faced go to the Garden of Eden. May it be Your will, Hashem our God, that You build Your city speedily in our days and give us our share in Your Torah.
He [Yehudah ben Teima] used to say: Five years [is the age] for [the study of] Scripture, Ten [is the age] for [the study of] Mishnah, Thirteen [is the age] for [observing] commandments, Fifteen [is the age] for [the study of] Talmud, Eighteen [is the age] for the [wedding] canopy, Twenty [is the age] for pursuing [a livelihood], Thirty [is the age] for [full] strength, Forty [is the age] for understanding, Fifty [is the age] for [giving] counsel, Sixty [is the age] for mature age, Seventy [is the age] for a hoary head, Eighty [is a sign of superadded] strength, Ninety [is the age] for [a] bending [stature], A hundred, is [the age at which one is] as if dead, passed away, and ceased from the world.
Ben Bag Bag says: Turn it, and turn it again, because all is in it; and in it contemplate, and grow gray and old over it; and never move away from it, for you cannot have any characteristic better than this.
Ben Hai Hai says: According to the suffering is the reward.

Chapter 6

Rabbi Meir says: Anyone who involves himself in Torah for its own sake merits many things, and moreover the entire world is worthwhile for his sake;  He is called "friend," "beloved," "lover of the Ominpresent," "lover of [all] creatures," "delighter of the Ominpresent," "delighter of [all] creatures;"  He is clothed in humility and reverence, and it prepares him to be righteous, devout, upright and trustworthy, and it distances him from sin, and draws him near to merit;  We enjoy from him counsel and comprehension, understanding and strength, as it is said (Proverbs 8:14): "Mine is counsel and comprehension, I am understanding, mine is strength;"  It gives him kingship and dominion, and [the ability to] investigate in judgement, and the secrets of the Torah are revealed to him, and he becomes like an ever-strengthening spring, and like a river that does not stop;  He is modest and long-tempered, and forgives insult to him;  And it enlarges him and raises him above all [that God] made.
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:  Each and every day a heavenly echo goes out from Mount Horeb, and announces and says: "Woe to the creatures for disparaging the Torah;"  for anyone who does not involve himself in the Torah is called "rebuked," as it is said (Proverbs 11:22): "A ring of gold in a swine's snout is a beautiful woman who turns from discretion," and it says (Exodus 32:16): "And the tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tablets," do not read "graven" (harut) but rather "freedom" (herut), for there is no free man except one that involves himself in Torah learning;  And anyone who involves himself in Torah learning is elevated, as it is said (Numbers 21:19): "and from Mattanah, Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel, Bamoth."
One who learns from his fellow one chapter or one law or one verse or one utterance {/thing?} or even one letter must treat him with honor, and we found it to be thus with David King of Israel, who learned from Ahithophel two things alone, [yet] called him his teacher, his guide, and his close friend{ lit. "familiar"}, as it is said (Psalms 55:14) "But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and my close friend." And if David, King of Israel, who only learned from Ahithophel two things called him his teacher, his guide, and his friend, how much more must one who learns from his fellow one chapter or one law or one verse or one one utterance or one letter treat his friend with an honor many times greater. And there is no honor except Torah, as it is said (Proverbs 3: 35) "The wise shall inherit honor", and "the whole-hearted shall inherit good" (28: 10), and there is no good except Torah as it is said (Proverbs 4:2) "I give you good doctrine, do not forsake my Torah".
This is the way [to toil in] Torah: eat bread with salt and drink a small amount of water and sleep on the ground and live a life [whose conditions will cause you] sorrow and in Torah you toil; if you do so (Psalms 128: 2) "happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee". Happy shalt though be in this world, and iy shall be well with thee in the world to come.
Do not ask for glory for yourself, and do not covet honour. More than just studying, act. And do not lust after the tables of kings since your table is greater than theirs and your crown is greater than theirs. And your employer is faithful; he will pay you the wages of your labour.
Greater is Torah than priesthood and kingship, for monarchy is obtained with thirty levels, and priesthood with twenty-four, and Torah is obtained with forty-eight things. And they are these: learning, listening of the ear, preparation of speech, understanding of the heart, reverence, awe, humility, happiness, purity, service of Sages, care in [selection of] friends, debate of the students, clarification, reading, learning, minimal commodities, minimal worldly occupation, minimal pleasure, minimal sleep, minimal conversation, minimal laughter, patience, generosity, trust in Sages, acceptance of suffering, knowing one's place, gladness in one's portion, erection of a fence to his words, lack of self-aggrandizement, lovableness, love of God, love of the creatures, love of the righteous, love of the upright, love of rebuke, distancing from honor, lack of arrogance in learning, lack of joy in teaching, lifting of a burden with one's friend, judgement with the benefit of the doubt, standing for the truth, standing for peace, deliberation in study, questioning and responding, hearing and adding, learning in order to teach and learning in order to act, making his master wiser, focusing one's words, citing the source, for it is taught that one who cites a source brings redemption to the world, as it says (Esther 2:22): "Esther told the king in Mordekhai’s name."
Great is Torah, for it gives life to those who do it in this world and in the next world, as it says: 'For they are life to those that find them, and healing to all his flesh' (Proverbs 4:22), and it says 'It will be healing for your navel, and tonic to your bones' (Proverbs 3:8). And it says 'It is a tree of life to those who hold it, and those who grasp it are happy' (Proverbs 3:18). And it says 'For they are an accompaniment of grace for your head, and a necklace for your  throat' (Proverbs 1:9). And it says 'She will give your head an accompaniment of grace; with a crown of glory she will protect you' (Proverbs 4:9). And it says 'For by me your days will be multiplied, and you will be given additional years of life' (Proverbs 9:11). And it says 'Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left is wealth and honor' (Proverbs 3:16), and it says 'For length of days and years of life and peace will be added to you' (Proverbs 3:2), and it says 'her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace' (Proverbs 3: 17).
Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda, in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai, says: beauty, strength, riches, honor, wisdom, maturity, hoary head, and children are fitting for the righteous and fitting for the world, as it is written: "The hoary head is a crown of glory, it will be found in the way of righteousness" (Proverbs 16:31). And it says (Proverbs 20:29), "The glory of young men is their strength; and the beauty of old men is the hoary head." And it says (Proverbs 14:24), "The crown of the wise is their wealth." And it says (Proverbs 17:6), "Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers." And it says (Isaiah 24:23), "Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for the Lord of hosts will reign in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before His elders shall be Glory." Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says: These seven qualities enumerated by the sages about the righteous were all fulfilled in Rebbi (Yehuda haNasi) and his sons. 
Said Rabbi Yosi ben Kisma: One time I was walking on the road, and a man met me, and greeted me, and I returned the greeting. He said to me, "My master, from which place are you?" I said to him, "I am from a great city of Sages and scribes." He said to me, "My master, do you wish to live among us in our place, and I would give you thousands of thousand golden <i>Dinarim</i> [specific unit of money], and precious stones and pearls?" I said to him, "If you were to give me all the silver, gold, precious stones and pearls in the world, I would not live but in a place of Torah." And so it is written in the book of Psalms by David, King of Israel (Psalms 119:72), "The law of Thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver." Moreover, at the time of a person's passing, neither silver, gold, nor precious stones or pearls accompany him, but Torah and good deeds alone, as it says (Proverbs 6:22), "When thou walkest, it shall lead thee, When thou liest down, it shall watch over thee; and when thou awakest, it shall be your conversation"; "When thou walkest, it shall lead thee" - in this world; "When thou liest down, it shall watch over thee" - in the grave; "and when thou awakest, it shall be your conversation" - for the world to come. And it says (Haggai 2:8), "Mine is the silver, and Mine the gold, saith the Lord of hosts."
Five possessions has the Holy One, Blessed be He, declared His own in His world, And they are: The Torah [is] one possession, Heaven and earth [are] one possession, Abraham [is] one possession, Israel [is] one possession, [And] the Sanctuary [is] one possession.  From where [do we infer that] the Torah [is] one possession? For it is written: “The Lord possessed me at the beginning of His way, the first of His of old.” (Proverbs 8:22.)  From where [do we infer that] heaven and earth [are] one possession? For it is written: “Thus says the Lord: ‘The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool. Which house might you build for Me? And which place might be My resting-place?’” (Isaiah 66:1), And it [also] says: “How manifold are Your works, O Lord! In wisdom have You made them all; full is the earth, Your possession.” (Psalm 104:24.)  From where [do we infer that] Abraham [is] one possession? For it is written: “And [Melchizedek] blessed him, and said: ‘Blessed be Abram of God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth.’” (Genesis 14:19.)  From where [do we infer that] Israel [is] one possession? For it is written: “Till Your people pass over, O Lord, till the people pass over whom You have made Your own” (Exodus 15:16), And it [also] says: “As for the holy that are in the earth, they are the excellent in whom is all My delight.” (Psalm 16:3.)  From where [do we infer that] the Sanctuary [is] one possession? For it is written: “The Sanctuary, O Lord, that Your hands have established” (Exodus 15:17), And it is [also] said: “And He brought them to His holy border, to the mountain, which His right hand had possessed.” (Psalm 78:54.)
Everything that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created in this world, He created only for His glory, as it says (Isaiah 43:7): "Every one that is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory, I have formed him, yea, I have made him." And it also says (Exodus 15:18 ), "The LORD shall reign for ever and ever." 
(Makkot 3:16) Rabbi  Chananya ben Akashia says, The Holy One, Blessed be He, wanted to give Israel merit; therefore He multiplied for them Torah and commandments, as it is written, "The Lord desired, for the sake of his righteousness, to make the Torah great and glorious," (Isaiah 42:21).
