Ben Zoma said, "Who is wise? He who learns from all men, as it said, 'From all my teachers I have gotten understanding (Psalms 119:99).' Who is mighty? He who controls his passions, as it is said, 'He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he that rules over his spirit than he that takes a city (Proverbs 16:32).' Who is rich? He who rejoices in his portion, as it is said, 'When you eat the labor of your hands, happy are you, and it shall be well with you (Psalms 128:2).' You are happy in this world, and it shall be well with you in the world to come. Who is honored? He who honors others, as it is said, "For those that honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be held in contempt. (I Samuel 2:30).'"
Ben Azzai said, "Hasten to do even a slight precept, and flee from transgression; for one virtue leads to another, and transgression draws transgression in its train; for the recompense of a virtue is a virtue, and the recompense of a transgression is a transgression."
He used to say, "Despise not any man, and carp not at any thing; for there is not a man that has not his hour, and there is not a thing that has not its place."
Rabbi Levitas of Yavneh said, "Be exceedingly lowly of spirit, since the hope of man is but the worm."
