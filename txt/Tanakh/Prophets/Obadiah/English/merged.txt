<span class="poetry indentAll">I will make you least among nations,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">You shall be most despised.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Your arrogant heart has seduced you,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">You who dwell in clefts of the rock,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">In your lofty abode.</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">You think in your heart,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">“Who can pull me down to earth?”</span>
