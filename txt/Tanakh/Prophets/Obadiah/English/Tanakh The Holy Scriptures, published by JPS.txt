Obadiah



Chapter 1

The prophecy of Obadiah.<br><br>We have received tidings from the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>And an envoy has been sent out among the nations:<br>“Up! Let us rise up against her for battle.”<br><br>Thus said my Lord G<small>OD</small> concerning Edom:
I will make you least among nations,<br>You shall be most despised.
Your arrogant heart has seduced you,<br>You who dwell in clefts of the rock,<br>In your lofty abode.<br>You think in your heart,<br>“Who can pull me down to earth?”
Should you nest as high as the eagle,<br>Should your eyrie be lodged ’mong the stars,<br>Even from there I will pull you down<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>
If thieves were to come to you,<br>Marauders by night,<br>They would steal no more than they needed.<br>If vintagers came to you,<br>They would surely leave some gleanings.<br>How utterly you are destroyed!
How thoroughly rifled is Esau,<br>How ransacked his hoards!
All your allies turned you back<br>At the frontier;<br>Your own confederates<br>Have duped and overcome you;<br>[Those who ate] your bread<br>Have planted snares under you.<br><br>He is bereft of understanding.
In that day<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>I will make the wise vanish from Edom,<br>Understanding from Esau’s mount.
Your warriors shall lose heart, O Teman,<br>And not a man on Esau’s mount<br>Shall survive the slaughter.<br>
For the outrage to your brother Jacob,<br>Disgrace shall engulf you,<br>And you shall perish forever.
On that day when you stood aloof,<br>When aliens carried off his goods,<br>When foreigners entered his gates<br>And cast lots for Jerusalem,<br>You were as one of them.<br>
<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “Do not,” and so through v. 14.</i>How could you<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> gaze with glee<br>On your brother that day,<br>On his day of calamity!<br>How could you gloat<br>Over the people of Judah<br>On that day of ruin!<br>How could you loudly jeer<br>On a day of anguish!
How could you enter the gate of My people<br>On its day of disaster,<br>Gaze in glee with the others<br>On its misfortune<br>On its day of disaster,<br>And lay hands on its wealth<br>On its day of disaster!
How could you stand at the passes<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i><br>To cut down its fugitives!<br>How could you betray those who fled<br>On that day of anguish!
As you did, so shall it be done to you;<br>Your conduct shall be requited.<br><br>Yea, against all nations<br>The day of the L<small>ORD</small> is at hand.
That same cup that you<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Israelites.</i> drank on My Holy Mount<br>Shall all nations drink evermore,<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “at My hand,” cf.

But on Zion’s mount a remnant shall survive,<br>And it shall be holy.<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., inviolate; cf. Jer. 2.3.</i><br>The House of Jacob shall dispossess<br>Those who dispossessed them.
The House of Jacob shall be fire,<br>And the House of Joseph flame,<br>And the House of Esau shall be straw;<br>They shall burn it and devour it,<br>And no survivor shall be left of the House of Esau<br>—for the L<small>ORD</small> has spoken.<br>
<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of parts of vv. 19–21 uncertain.</i>Thus they shall possess the Negeb and Mount Esau as well, the Shephelah and Philistia. They shall possess the Ephraimite country and the district of Samaria,<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">After the exile of the northern tribes, the city and district of Samaria were occupied mainly by non-Israelites.</i> and Benjamin<sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “the land of the Ammonites.”</i> along with Gilead.
And that exiled force of Israelites [shall possess] what belongs to the Phoenicians as far as Zarephath,<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">A town in southern Phoenicia; see 1 Kings 17.9.</i> while the Jerusalemite exile community of Sepharad<sup class="footnote-marker">j</sup><i class="footnote">Probably Asia Minor, called Saparda in Persian cuneiform inscriptions.</i> shall possess the towns of the Negeb.
For <sup class="footnote-marker">k</sup><i class="footnote">Several ancient versions read, “they [the exiles from Jerusalem named in the preceding verse] shall march up victorious.”</i>liberators shall march up<sup class="endFootnote">-k</sup> on Mount Zion to wreak judgment on Mount Esau; and dominion shall be the L<small>ORD</small>’s.
