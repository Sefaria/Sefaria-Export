Chapter 3



Chapter 4

In those days Hashem will do Gathering of Exiles
I will gather the nations to the Valley of Jehoshaphat and judge them
They sold our kids for prostitutes and wine
You think you'll pay me back‽ I'll pay YOU back!
You took all my money
You sold my people as slaves
Here's how I'll pay you back
I'll sell your children as slaves
Calling all warriors! Big war coming!
Make farming equipment into weapons
All the nations should gather together
Gather to Valley of Jehoshaphat for a big judgment
Harvest time for the evil enemies
Pile of corpses
The sun, moon and stars will go dark
Hashem will call out. Heavens will shake. He'll protect His people.
Jerusalem will be holy. Strangers won't got there anymore.
The mountains will be full of wine.The valleys will be full of milk. Water will flow from the Beit Hamikdash
Egypt and Edom will be destroyed
Judah and Jerusalem will last forever
I will cleanse, but blood I won't cleanse
