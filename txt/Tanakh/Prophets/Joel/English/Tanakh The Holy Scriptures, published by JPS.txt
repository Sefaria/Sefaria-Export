Joel



Chapter 1

The word of the L<small>ORD</small> that came to Joel son of Pethuel.<br>
Listen to this, O elders,<br>Give ear, all inhabitants of the land.<br>Has the like of this happened in your days<br>Or in the days of your fathers?
Tell your children about it,<br>And let your children tell theirs,<br>And their children the next generation!
What the cutter<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">The Heb. terms translated “cutter, locust, grub, and hopper” are of uncertain meaning; they probably designate stages in the development of the locust.</i> has left, the locust has devoured;<br>What the locust has left, the grub has devoured;<br>And what the grub has left, the hopper has devoured.
Wake up, you drunkards, and weep,<br>Wail, all you swillers of wine—<br>For the new wine that is <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “cut off from your mouth.”</i>denied you!<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
For a nation has invaded my land,<br>Vast beyond counting,<br>With teeth like the teeth of a lion,<br>With the fangs of a lion’s breed.
They have laid my vines waste<br>And splintered my fig trees:<br>They have stripped off their bark and thrown [it] away;<br>Their runners have turned white.<br>
Lament—like a maiden girt with sackcloth<br>For the husband of her youth!
Offering and libation have ceased<br>From the House of the L<small>ORD</small>;<br>The priests must mourn<br>Who minister to the L<small>ORD</small>.
The country is ravaged,<br>The ground must mourn;<br>For the new grain is ravaged,<br>The new wine is dried up,<br>The new oil has failed.
Farmers are dismayed<br>And vine dressers wail<br>Over wheat and barley;<br>For the crops of the field are lost.
The vine has dried up,<br>The fig tree withers,<br>Pomegranate, palm, and apple—<br>All the trees of the field are sear.<br>And joy has dried up<br>Among men.<br>
Gird yourselves and lament, O priests,<br>Wail, O ministers of the altar;<br>Come, spend the night in sackcloth,<br>O ministers of my God.<br>For offering and libation are withheld<br>From the House of your God.
Solemnize a fast,<br>Proclaim an assembly;<br>Gather the elders—all the inhabitants of the land—<br>In the House of the L<small>ORD</small> your God,<br>And cry out to the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>
Alas for the day!<br>For the day of the L<small>ORD</small> is near;<br>It shall come like havoc from Shaddai.<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Traditionally “the Almighty”; see Gen. 17.1.</i>
For food is cut off<br>Before our very eyes,<br>And joy and gladness<br>From the House of our God.
<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>The seeds have shriveled<br>Under their clods.<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup><br>The granaries are desolate,<br>Barns are in ruins,<br>For the new grain has failed.
How the beasts groan!<br>The herds of cattle are bewildered<br>Because they have no pasture,<br>And the flocks of sheep are dazed.<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i><br>
To You, O L<small>ORD</small>, I call.<br>For fire<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., scorching heat.</i> has consumed<br>The pastures in the wilderness,<br>And flame<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., scorching heat.</i> has devoured<br>All the trees of the countryside.
The very beasts of the field<br>Cry out to You;<br>For the watercourses are dried up,<br>And fire has consumed<br>The pastures in the wilderness.

Chapter 2

Blow a horn in Zion,<br>Sound an alarm on My holy mount!<br>Let all dwellers on earth tremble,<br>For the day of the L<small>ORD</small> has come!<br>It is close—
A day of darkness and gloom,<br>A day of densest cloud<br>Spread like soot over the hills.<br>A vast, enormous horde—<br>Nothing like it has ever happened,<br>And it shall never happen again<br>Through the years and ages.<br>
Their vanguard is a consuming fire,<br>Their rear guard a devouring flame.<br>Before them the land was like the Garden of Eden,<br>Behind them, a desolate waste:<br>Nothing has escaped them.
They have the appearance of horses,<br>They gallop just like steeds.
With a clatter as of chariots<br>They bound on the hilltops,<br>With a noise like a blazing fire<br>Consuming straw;<br>Like an enormous horde<br>Arrayed for battle.
Peoples tremble before them,<br>All faces <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain; cf. Nah. 2.11.</i>turn ashen.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>
They rush like warriors,<br>They scale a wall like fighters.<br>And each keeps to his own track.<br>Their paths never cross;<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>
No one jostles another,<br>Each keeps to his own course.<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>And should they fall through a loophole,<br>They do not get hurt.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
They rush up the wall,<br>They dash about in the city;<br>They climb into the houses,<br>They enter like thieves<br>By way of the windows.
Before them earth trembles,<br>Heaven shakes,<br>Sun and moon are darkened,<br>And stars withdraw their brightness.
And the L<small>ORD</small> roars aloud<br>At the head of His army;<br>For vast indeed is His host,<br>Numberless are those that do His bidding.<br>For great is the day of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>Most terrible—who can endure it?
“Yet even now”—says the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>“Turn back to Me with all your hearts,<br>And with fasting, weeping, and lamenting.”
Rend your hearts<br>Rather than your garments,<br>And turn back to the L<small>ORD</small> your God.<br>For He is gracious and compassionate,<br>Slow to anger, abounding in kindness,<br>And renouncing punishment.
Who knows but He may turn and relent,<br>And leave a blessing behind<br>For meal offering and drink offering<br>To the L<small>ORD</small> your God?<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">When the locusts depart, there will again be yield enough for offerings; see 1.9.</i><br>
Blow a horn in Zion,<br>Solemnize a fast,<br>Proclaim an assembly!
Gather the people,<br>Bid the congregation purify themselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Exod. 19.10; Zeph. 1.7.</i><br>Bring together the old,<br>Gather the babes<br>And the sucklings at the breast;<br>Let the bridegroom come out of his chamber,<br>The bride from her canopied couch.
Between the portico and the altar,<br>Let the priests, the L<small>ORD</small>’s ministers, weep<br>And say:<br>“Oh, spare Your people, L<small>ORD</small>!<br>Let not Your possession become a mockery,<br>To be taunted by nations!<br>Let not the peoples say,<br>‘Where is their God?’”<br>
Then the L<small>ORD</small> was roused<br>On behalf of His land<br>And had compassion<br>Upon His people.
In response to His people<br>The L<small>ORD</small> declared:<br>“I will grant you the new grain,<br>The new wine, and the new oil,<br>And you shall have them in abundance.<br>Nevermore will I let you be<br>A mockery among the nations.
I will drive the northerner<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the locusts. Emendation yields “My multitude”; cf. “nation” (1.6), “horde,” “army,” and “host” (2.2, 5, 11, and 25).</i> far from you,<br>I will thrust it into a parched and desolate land—<br>Its van to the Eastern Sea<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">The Dead Sea.</i><br>And its rear to the Western Sea;<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">The Mediterranean Sea.</i><br>And the stench of it shall go up,<br>And the foul smell rise.”<br>For [the L<small>ORD</small>] shall work great deeds.
Fear not, O soil, rejoice and be glad;<br>For the L<small>ORD</small> has wrought great deeds.
Fear not, O beasts of the field,<br>For the pastures in the wilderness<br>Are clothed with grass.<br>The trees have borne their fruit;<br>Fig tree and vine<br>Have yielded their strength.
O children of Zion, be glad,<br>Rejoice in the L<small>ORD</small> your God.<br>For He has given you the early rain in [His] kindness,<br>Now He makes the rain fall [as] formerly—<br>The early rain and the late—
And threshing floors shall be piled with grain,<br>And vats shall overflow with new wine and oil.
“I will repay you <sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “double what was.”</i>for the years<sup class="endFootnote">-h</sup><br>Consumed by swarms and hoppers,<br>By grubs and locusts,<br>The great army I let loose against you.
And you shall eat your fill<br>And praise the name of the L<small>ORD</small> your God<br>Who dealt so wondrously with you—<br>My people shall be shamed no more.
And you shall know<br>That I am in the midst of Israel:<br>That I the L<small>ORD</small> am your God<br>And there is no other.<br>And My people shall be shamed no more.”

Chapter 3

After that,<br>I will pour out My spirit on all flesh;<br>Your sons and daughters shall prophesy;<br>Your old men shall dream dreams,<br>And your young men shall see visions.
I will even pour out My spirit<br>Upon male and female slaves in those days.<br>
<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Brought up from v. 4 for clarity.</i>Before the great and terrible day of the L<small>ORD</small> comes,<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br>I will set portents in the sky and on earth:<br>Blood and fire and pillars of smoke;
The sun shall turn into darkness<br>And the moon into blood.
But everyone who invokes the name of the L<small>ORD</small> shall escape; for there shall be a remnant on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, as the L<small>ORD</small> promised. <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Anyone who invokes the L<small>ORD</small> will be among the survivors.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>

Chapter 4

For lo! in those days<br>And in that time,<br>When I restore the fortunes<br>Of Judah and Jerusalem,
I will gather all the nations<br>And bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat.<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Here understood as “The Lord contends”; contrast v. 12.</i><br>There I will contend with them<br>Over My very own people, Israel,<br>Which they scattered among the nations.<br>For they divided My land among themselves
And cast lots over My people;<br>And they bartered a boy for a whore,<br>And sold a girl for wine, which they drank.<br>
What is this you are doing to Me, O Tyre, Sidon, and all the districts of Philistia? Are you requiting Me for something I have done, or are you doing something for My benefit? Quick as a flash, I will pay you back;
for you have taken My gold and My silver, and have carried off My precious treasures to your palaces;
and you have sold the people of Judah and the people of Jerusalem to the Ionians, so that you have removed them far away from their homeland.
Behold, I will rouse them to leave the place you have sold them to, and I will pay you back:
I will deliver your sons and daughters into the hands of the people of Judah, and they will sell them into captivity to a distant nation—for the L<small>ORD</small> has spoken.<br>
Proclaim this among the nations:<br>Prepare for battle!<br>Arouse the warriors,<br>Let all the fighters come and draw near!
Beat your plowshares<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">See note at Isa. 2.4.</i> into swords,<br>And your pruning hooks into spears.<br>Let even the weakling say, “I am strong.”
<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Rouse yourselves<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup> and come,<br>All you nations;<br>Come together<br>From round about.<br>There <sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>bring down<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup><br>Your warriors, O L<small>ORD</small>!
Let the nations rouse themselves and march up<br>To the Valley of Jehoshaphat;<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Here understood as “The Lord judges”; contrast v. 2.</i><br>For there I will sit in judgment<br>Over all the nations round about.
Swing the sickle,<br>For the crop is ripe;<br>Come and tread,<br>For the winepress is full,<br>The vats are overflowing!<br>For great is their wickedness.<br>
Multitudes upon multitudes<br>In the Valley of Decision!<br>For the day of the L<small>ORD</small> is at hand<br>In the Valley of Decision.
Sun and moon are darkened,<br>And stars withdraw their brightness.
And the L<small>ORD</small> will roar from Zion,<br>And shout aloud from Jerusalem,<br>So that heaven and earth tremble.<br>But the L<small>ORD</small> will be a shelter to His people,<br>A refuge to the children of Israel.
And you shall know that I the L<small>ORD</small> your God<br>Dwell in Zion, My holy mount.<br>And Jerusalem shall be holy;<br>Nevermore shall strangers pass through it.
And in that day,<br>The mountains shall drip with wine,<br>The hills shall flow with milk,<br>And all the watercourses of Judah shall flow with water;<br>A spring shall issue from the House of the L<small>ORD</small><br>And shall water the Wadi of the Acacias.
Egypt shall be a desolation,<br>And Edom a desolate waste,<br>Because of the outrage to the people of Judah,<br>In whose land they shed the blood of the innocent.
But Judah shall be inhabited forever,<br>And Jerusalem throughout the ages.
Thus <sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “their unavenged blood shall be avenged.”</i>I will treat as innocent their blood<br>Which I have not treated as innocent;<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup><br>And the L<small>ORD</small> shall dwell in Zion.
