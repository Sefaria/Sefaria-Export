Nahum



Chapter 1

A pronouncement on Nineveh: The Book of the Prophecy of Nahum the Elkoshite.<br>
The L<small>ORD</small> is a passionate, avenging God;<br>The L<small>ORD</small> is vengeful and fierce in wrath.<br>The L<small>ORD</small> takes vengeance on His enemies,<br>He rages against His foes.
The L<small>ORD</small> is slow to anger and of great forbearance,<br>But the L<small>ORD</small> does not remit all punishment.<br>He travels in whirlwind and storm,<br>And clouds are the dust on His feet.
He rebukes the sea and dries it up,<br>And He makes all rivers fail;<br>Bashan and Carmel languish,<br>And the blossoms<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “bud.”</i> of Lebanon wither.
The mountains quake because of Him,<br>And the hills melt.<br>The earth heaves<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> before Him,<br>The world and all that dwell therein.
Who can stand before His wrath?<br>Who can resist His fury?<br>His anger pours out like fire,<br>And rocks are shattered because of Him.
The L<small>ORD</small> is good to [those who hope in Him],<br>A haven on a day of distress;<br>He is mindful of those who seek refuge in Him.
And with a sweeping flood<br>He makes an end of <sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain; emendation yields “those who oppose Him.”</i>her place,<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup><br>And chases His enemies into darkness.
Why will you plot against the L<small>ORD</small>?<br>He wreaks utter destruction:<br>No adversary<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ugaritic ṣrt.</i> opposes Him twice!
<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>For like men besotted with drink,<br>They are burned up like tangled thorns,<br>Like straw that is thoroughly dried.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>
<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Vv. 11–14 would read well after 2.1.</i>The base plotter<br>Who designed evil against the L<small>ORD</small><br>Has left you.
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>“Even as they<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the days of your affliction.</i> were full and many,<br>Even so are they over and gone;<br>As surely as I afflicted you,<br>I will afflict you no more.”<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
And now<br>I will break off his yoke bar from you<br>And burst your cords apart.
The L<small>ORD</small> has commanded concerning him:<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “you.”</i><br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>No posterity shall continue your name.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>I will do away with<br>The carved and graven images<br>In the temples of your gods;<br>I will make your grave<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Accord with your worthlessness.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>

Chapter 2

Behold on the hills<br>The footsteps of a herald<br>Announcing good fortune!<br>“Celebrate your festivals, O Judah,<br>Fulfill your vows.<br>Never again shall scoundrels invade you,<br>They have totally vanished.”
<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">This verse would read well after v. 3.</i>A shatterer has come up against you.<br>Man the guard posts,<br>Watch the road;<br>Steady your loins,<br>Brace all your strength!<br>
For the L<small>ORD</small> has restored <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">“Jacob” refers to the northern kingdom (cf. Amos 6.8; 8.7); Israel refers to the southern kingdom, regarded as the remnant of Israel after the fall of the northern kingdom (cf. Mic. 1.13–15).</i>the Pride<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “vine.”</i> of Jacob<br>As well as the Pride<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “vine.”</i> of Israel,<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>Though marauders have laid them waste<br>And ravaged their branches.<br>
His warriors’ shields are painted red,<br>And the soldiers are clothed in crimson;<br>The chariots are like flaming torches,<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Understanding peladoth as equivalent to lappidoth.</i><br>On the day they are made ready.<br><sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain. Emendation yields “The horsemen charge”; cf. 3.3.</i>The [arrows of] cypress wood are poisoned,<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup>
The chariots dash about frenzied in the fields,<br>They rush through the meadows.<br>They appear like torches,<br>They race like streaks of lightning.
<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>He commands his burly men;<br>They stumble as they advance,<br>They hasten up to her wall,<br>Where <sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">To protect the crews that swung the battering rams.</i>wheeled shelters<sup class="endFootnote">-g</sup> are set up.<sup class="endFootnote">-g</sup>
<sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the walls are breached and the palace is overrun.</i>The floodgates are opened,<br>And the palace is deluged.<sup class="endFootnote">-h</sup>
<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.

Nineveh has been like a [placid] pool of water<br><sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>From earliest times;<sup class="endFootnote">-f</sup><br>Now they flee.<br>“Stop! Stop!”—<br>But none can turn them back.
“Plunder silver! Plunder gold!”<br>There is no limit to the treasure;<br>It is a hoard of all precious objects.<br>
Desolation, devastation, and destruction!<br>Spirits sink,<br>Knees buckle,<br>All loins tremble,<br>All faces <sup class="footnote-marker">k</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain; cf. note at Joel 2.6.</i>turn ashen.<sup class="endFootnote">-k</sup>
What has become of that lions’ den,<br>That pasture<sup class="footnote-marker">l</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “cave.”</i> of great beasts,<br>Where lion and lion’s breed walked,<br>And lion’s cub—with none to disturb them?
[Where is] the lion that tore victims for his cubs<br>And strangled for his lionesses,<br>And filled his lairs with prey<br>And his dens with mangled flesh?
I am going to deal with you<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts:<br>I will burn down <sup class="footnote-marker">m</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “your thicket in fire.”</i>her chariots in smoke,<sup class="endFootnote">-m</sup><br>And the sword shall devour your great beasts;<br>I will stamp out your killings from the earth,<br>And the sound of your messengers<sup class="footnote-marker">n</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “devouring.”</i><br>Shall be heard no more.

Chapter 3

Ah, city of crime,<br>Utterly treacherous,<br>Full of violence,<br>Where killing never stops!<br>
Crack of whip<br>And rattle of wheel,<br>Galloping steed<br>And bounding chariot!
Charging horsemen,<br>Flashing swords,<br>And glittering spears!<br>Hosts of slain<br>And heaps of corpses,<br>Dead bodies without number—<br>They stumble over bodies.
Because of the countless harlotries of the harlot,<br>The winsome mistress of sorcery,<br>Who ensnared<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> nations with her harlotries<br>And peoples with her sorcery,
I am going to deal with you<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts.<br>I will lift up your skirts over your face<br>And display your nakedness to the nations<br>And your shame to kingdoms.
I will throw loathsome things over you<br>And disfigure you<br>And make a spectacle of you.
All who see you will recoil from you<br>And will say,<br>“Nineveh has been ravaged!”<br>Who will console her?<br>Where shall I look for<br>Anyone to comfort you?
Were you any better than No-amon,<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Amon was the tutelary deity of No (Thebes; cf. Jer. 46.25), which the Assyrians had sacked in 663 b.c.e.</i><br>Which sat by the Nile,<br>Surrounded by water—<br>Its rampart a river,<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “sea.”</i><br>Its wall <sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Change of vocalization yields “water.”</i>consisting of sea?<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup>
Populous Nubia<br>And teeming Egypt,<br>Put and the Libyans—<br>They were her<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “your.”</i> helpers.
Yet even she was exiled,<br>She went into captivity.<br>Her babes, too, were dashed in pieces<br>At every street corner.<br>Lots were cast for her honored men,<br>And all her nobles were bound in chains.
You too shall be drunk<br>And utterly overcome;<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i><br>You too shall seek<br>A refuge from the enemy.
All your forts are fig trees<br>With<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “Your troops are”; cf. next verse.</i> ripe fruit;<br>If shaken they will fall<br>Into the mouths of devourers.
Truly, the troops within you are women;<br>The gates of your land have opened themselves<br>To your enemies;<br>Fire has consumed your gate bars.<br>
Draw water for the siege,<br>Strengthen your forts;<br>Tread the clay,<br>Trample the mud,<br>Grasp the brick mold!
There fire will devour you,<br>The sword will put an end to you;<br>It will devour you like the grub.<br><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Multiply like grubs,<br>Multiply like locusts!<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br>
You had more traders<br>Than the sky has stars—<br>The grubs cast their skins and fly away.
Your guards were like locusts,<br>Your marshals like piles of hoppers<br>Which settle on the stone fences<br>On a chilly day;<br>When the sun comes out, they fly away,<br>And where they are nobody knows.
Your shepherds are slumbering,<br>O king of Assyria;<br>Your sheepmasters are <sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “dwelling”; emendation yields “asleep.”</i>lying inert;<sup class="endFootnote">-g</sup><br>Your people are scattered<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> over the hills,<br>And there is none to gather them.
There is no healing<sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. kehah, a variant of gehah; see Prov. 17.22.</i> for your injury;<br>Your wound is grievous.<br>All who hear the news about you<br>Clap their hands over you.<br>For who has not suffered<br>From your constant malice?
