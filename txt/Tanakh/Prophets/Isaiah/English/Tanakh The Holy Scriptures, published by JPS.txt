Isaiah



Chapter 1

The prophecies of Isaiah son of Amoz, who prophesied concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.<br>
Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth,<br>For the L<small>ORD</small> has spoken:<br>“I reared children and brought them up—<br>And they have rebelled against Me!
An ox knows its owner,<br>An ass its master’s crib:<br>Israel does not know,<br>My people takes no thought.”<br>
Ah, sinful nation!<br>People laden with iniquity!<br>Brood of evildoers!<br>Depraved children!<br>They have forsaken the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>Spurned the Holy One of Israel,<br>Turned their backs [on Him].<br>
Why do you seek further beatings,<br>That you continue to offend?<br>Every head is ailing,<br>And every heart is sick.
From head to foot<br>No spot is sound:<br>All bruises, and welts,<br>And festering sores—<br>Not pressed out, not bound up,<br>Not softened with oil.
Your land is a waste,<br>Your cities burnt down;<br>Before your eyes, the yield of your soil<br>Is consumed by strangers—<br>A wasteland <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “like Sodom overthrown.”</i>as overthrown by strangers!<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>
Fair<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “Daughter.”</i> Zion is left<br>Like a booth in a vineyard,<br>Like a hut in a cucumber field,<br>Like a city beleaguered.
Had not the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts<br>Left us some survivors,<br>We should be like Sodom,<br>Another Gomorrah.<br>
Hear the word of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>You chieftains of Sodom;<br>Give ear to our God’s instruction,<br>You folk of Gomorrah!
“What need have I of all your sacrifices?”<br>Says the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>“I am sated with burnt offerings of rams,<br>And suet of fatlings,<br>And blood of bulls;<br>And I have no delight<br>In lambs and he-goats.
That you come to appear before Me—<br>Who asked that <sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Others “To trample My courts? / 13Bring no more vain oblations.”</i>of you?<br>Trample My courts
no more;<br>Bringing oblations is futile,<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup><br>Incense is offensive to Me.<br>New moon and sabbath,<br>Proclaiming of solemnities,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Septuagint “Fast and assembly”; cf. Joel 1.14.</i>Assemblies with iniquity,<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup><br>I cannot abide.
Your new moons and fixed seasons<br>Fill Me with loathing;<br>They are become a burden to Me,<br>I cannot endure them.
And when you lift up your hands,<br>I will turn My eyes away from you;<br>Though you pray at length,<br>I will not listen.<br>Your hands are stained with crime—
Wash yourselves clean;<br>Put your evil doings<br>Away from My sight.<br>Cease to do evil;
Learn to do good.<br>Devote yourselves to justice;<br><sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Aid the wronged.<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup><br>Uphold the rights of the orphan;<br>Defend the cause of the widow.<br>
“Come, <sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>let us reach an understanding,<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup><br>—says the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>Be your sins like crimson,<br>They can turn snow-white;<br>Be they red as dyed wool,<br>They can become like fleece.”
If, then, you agree and give heed,<br>You will eat the good things of the earth;
But if you refuse and disobey,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Or “you will be fed the sword.”</i>You will be devoured [by] the sword.<sup class="endFootnote">-f</sup>—<br>For it was the L<small>ORD</small> who spoke.<br>
Alas, she has become a harlot,<br>The faithful city<br>That was filled with justice,<br>Where righteousness dwelt—<br>But now murderers.
Your<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., Jerusalem’s.</i> silver has turned to dross;<br><sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Your wine is cut with water.<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup>
Your rulers are rogues<br>And cronies of thieves,<br>Every one avid for presents<br>And greedy for gifts;<br>They do not judge the case of the orphan,<br>And the widow’s cause never reaches them.<br>
Assuredly, this is the declaration<br>Of the Sovereign, the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts,<br>The Mighty One of Israel:<br>“Ah, I will get satisfaction from My foes;<br>I will wreak vengeance on My enemies!
I will turn My hand against you,<br>And smelt out your dross <sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “in a crucible”; cf. 48.10.</i>as with lye,<sup class="endFootnote">-h</sup><br>And remove all your slag:
I will restore your magistrates as of old,<br>And your counselors as of yore.<br>After that you shall be called<br>City of Righteousness, Faithful City.”<br>
<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">Others “Zion shall be saved by justice, / Her repentant ones by righteousness.”</i>Zion shall be saved in the judgment;<br>Her repentant ones, in the retribution.<sup class="footnote-marker">j</sup><i class="footnote">For this meaning cf. 5.16; 10.22.</i>
But rebels and sinners shall all be crushed,<br>And those who forsake the L<small>ORD</small> shall perish.<br>
Truly, you<sup class="footnote-marker">k</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “they.”</i> shall be shamed<br>Because of the terebinths you desired,<br>And you shall be confounded<br>Because of the gardens you coveted.
For you shall be like a terebinth<br>Wilted of leaf,<br>And like a garden<br>That has no water,
<sup class="footnote-marker">l</sup><i class="footnote">Connecting ḥason with ḥasan, “to store” (23.18), and ḥosen, “treasure” (33.6).</i>Stored wealth<sup class="endFootnote">-l</sup> shall become as tow,<br>And he who amassed it a spark;<br>And the two shall burn together,<br>With none to quench.

Chapter 2

The word that Isaiah son of Amoz prophesied concerning Judah and Jerusalem.<br>
In the days to come,<br>The Mount of the L<small>ORD</small>’s House<br>Shall stand firm above the mountains<br>And tower above the hills;<br>And all the nations<br>Shall gaze on it with joy.
And the many peoples shall go and say:<br>“Come,<br>Let us go up to the Mount of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>To the House of the God of Jacob;<br>That He may instruct us in His ways,<br>And that we may walk in His paths.”<br>For instruction shall come forth<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., oracles will be obtainable.</i> from Zion,<br>The word of the L<small>ORD</small> from Jerusalem.
Thus He will judge among the nations<br>And arbitrate for the many peoples,<br>And they shall beat their swords into plowshares<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">More exactly, the iron points with which wooden plows were tipped.</i><br>And their spears into pruning hooks:<br>Nation shall not take up<br>Sword against nation;<br>They shall never again know<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Judg. 3.2.</i> war.<br>
O House of Jacob!<br>Come, let us walk<br>By the light of the L<small>ORD</small>.
For you have forsaken [the ways of] your people,<br>O House of Jacob!<br><sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “For they are full of divination / and have abundance of soothsaying, / Like Philistines / And like alien folk.”</i>For they are full [of practices] from the East,<br>And of soothsaying like the Philistines;<br>They abound in customs<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Targum; lit. “children.”</i> of the aliens.<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup>
Their land is full of silver and gold,<br>There is no limit to their treasures;<br>Their land is full of horses,<br>There is no limit to their chariots.
And their land is full of idols;<br>They bow down to the work of their hands,<br>To what their own fingers have wrought.
But man shall be humbled,<br>And mortal brought low—<br><sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain. Emendation yields “And their idols with them”; cf. vv. 17–21.</i>Oh, do not forgive them!<sup class="endFootnote">-f</sup><br>
Go deep into the rock,<br>Bury yourselves in the ground,<br>Before the terror of the L<small>ORD</small><br>And His dread majesty!
Man’s haughty look shall be brought low,<br>And the pride of mortals shall be humbled.<br>None but the L<small>ORD</small> shall be<br>Exalted in that day.<br>
For the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts has ready a day<br>Against all that is proud and arrogant,<br>Against all that is lofty—so that it is brought low:
Against all the cedars of Lebanon,<br>Tall and stately,<br>And all the oaks of Bashan;
Against all the high mountains<br>And all the lofty hills;
Against every soaring tower<br>And every mighty wall;
Against all the <sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Probably a type of large ship.</i>ships of Tarshish<sup class="endFootnote">-g</sup><br>And all the gallant barks.
Then man’s haughtiness shall be humbled<br>And the pride of man brought low.<br>None but the L<small>ORD</small> shall be<br>Exalted in that day.<br>
As for idols, they shall vanish completely.
And men shall enter caverns in the rock<br>And hollows in the ground—<br>Before the terror of the L<small>ORD</small><br>And His dread majesty,<br>When He comes forth to overawe the earth.
On that day, men shall fling away,<br>To the <sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Exact meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>flying foxes<sup class="endFootnote">-h</sup> and the bats,<br>The idols of silver<br>And the idols of gold<br>Which they made for worshiping.
And they shall enter the clefts in the rocks<br>And the crevices in the cliffs,<br>Before the terror of the L<small>ORD</small><br>And His dread majesty,<br>When He comes forth to overawe the earth.<br>
Oh, cease to glorify man,<br>Who has only a breath in his nostrils!<br>For by what does he merit esteem?

Chapter 3

For lo!<br>The Sovereign L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts<br>Will remove from Jerusalem and from Judah<br>Prop and stay,<br>Every prop of food<br>And every prop of water:<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “clothing”; cf. v. 7; 4.1.</i>

And He<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “I.”</i> will make boys their rulers,<br>And babes shall govern them.
So the people shall oppress one another—<br>Each oppressing his fellow:<br>The young shall bully the old;<br>And the despised [shall bully] the honored.<br>
For should a man seize his brother,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “His father’s son, saying…”</i>In whose father’s house there is clothing:<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup><br>“Come, be a chief over us,<br>And let this ruin<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.

The other will thereupon protest,<br>“I will not be a dresser of wounds,<br>With no food or clothing in my own house.<br>You shall not make me chief of a people!”<br>
Ah, Jerusalem has stumbled,<br>And Judah has fallen,<br>Because by word and deed<br>They insult the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>Defying His majestic glance.
Their partiality in judgment<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">So Targum; cf. Deut. 1.17; 16.19.</i> accuses them;<br>They avow their sins like Sodom,<br>They do not conceal them.<br>Woe to them! For ill<br>Have they served themselves.
(Hail<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “Happy is.”</i> the just man, for he shall fare well;<br>He shall eat the fruit of his works.
Woe to the wicked man, for he shall fare ill;<br>As his hands have dealt, so shall it be done to him.)
My people’s rulers are babes,<br>It is governed by women.<sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “boys”; cf. v. 4 (and v. 5).</i><br>O my people!<br>Your leaders are misleaders;<br>They have confused the course of your paths.<br>
The L<small>ORD</small> stands up to plead a cause,<br>He rises to champion peoples.<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">Septuagint “His people”; cf. vv. 14, 15.</i>
The L<small>ORD</small> will bring this charge<br>Against the elders and officers of His people:<br>“It is you who have ravaged the vineyard;<br>That which was robbed from the poor is in your houses.
How dare you crush My people<br>And grind the faces of the poor?”<br>—says my Lord G<small>OD</small> of Hosts.<br>
The L<small>ORD</small> said:<br>“Because the daughters of Zion<br>Are so vain<br>And walk with <sup class="footnote-marker">j</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “throats bent back.”</i>heads thrown back,<sup class="endFootnote">-j</sup><br>With roving eyes,<br>And with mincing gait,<br>Making a tinkling with their feet”—

In that day, my L<small>ORD</small> will strip off the finery<sup class="footnote-marker">l</sup><i class="footnote">Many of the articles named in vv. 18–24 cannot be identified with certainty.</i> of the anklets, the fillets, and the crescents;
of the eardrops, the bracelets, and the veils;
the turbans, the armlets, and the sashes; of the talismans and the amulets;
the signet rings and the nose rings;
of the festive robes, the mantles, and the shawls; the purses,
the lace gowns, and the linen vests; and the kerchiefs and the capes.<br>
And then—<br>Instead of perfume, there shall be rot;<br>And instead of an apron, a rope;<br>Instead of a diadem of beaten-work,<br>A shorn head;<br>Instead of a rich robe,<br>A girding of sackcloth;<br><sup class="footnote-marker">m</sup><i class="footnote">The complete Isaiah scroll from Qumran, hereafter 1QIsa, reads “For shame shall take the place of beauty”; cf. note k.</i>A burn instead of beauty.<sup class="endFootnote">-m</sup><br>

Chapter 4

In that day, seven women shall take hold of one man, saying,<br>“We will eat our own food<br>And wear our own clothes;<br>Only let us be called by your name—<br>Take away our disgrace!”

which shall serve as a pavilion for shade from heat by day and as a shelter for protection against drenching rain.

Chapter 5

Let me sing for my beloved<br>A song of my lover about his vineyard.<br><br>My beloved had a vineyard<br><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>On a fruitful hill.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>
He broke the ground, cleared it of stones,<br>And planted it with choice vines.<br>He built a watchtower inside it,<br>He even hewed a wine press in it;<br>For he hoped it would yield grapes.<br>Instead, it yielded wild grapes.
“Now, then,<br>Dwellers of Jerusalem<br>And men of Judah,<br>You be the judges<br>Between Me and My vineyard:
What more could have been done for My vineyard<br>That I failed to do in it?<br>Why, when I hoped it would yield grapes,<br>Did it yield wild grapes?<br>
“Now I am going to tell you<br>What I will do to My vineyard:<br>I will remove its hedge,<br>That it may be ravaged;<br>I will break down its wall,<br>That it may be trampled.
And I will <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>make it a desolation;<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br>It shall not be pruned or hoed,<br>And it shall be overgrown with briers and thistles.<br>And I will command the clouds<br>To drop no rain on it.”<br>
For the vineyard of the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts<br>Is the House of Israel,<br>And the seedlings he lovingly tended<br>Are the men of Judah.<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">This sentence contains two word-plays: “And He hoped for mishpat·, And there is mispaḥ [exact meaning uncertain]; / For ṣedaqah, But there is ṣe‘aqah [lit. ‘outcry’].”</i>And He hoped for justice,<br>But behold, injustice;<br>For equity,<br>But behold, iniquity!<br>
Ah,<br>Those who add house to house<br>And join field to field,<br>Till there is room for none but you<br>To dwell in the land!
In my hearing [said] the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts:<br>Surely, great houses<br>Shall lie forlorn,<br>Spacious and splendid ones<br>Without occupants.
For ten acres of vineyard<br>Shall yield just one <i>bath</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., of wine. The bath was the liquid equivalent of the ephah; and the ḥomer was ten baths or ephahs (Ezek. 45.11).</i><br>And a field sown with a <i>ḥomer</i> of seed<br>Shall yield a mere <i>ephah</i>.<br>

Chapter 6

In the year that King Uzziah died, I beheld my Lord seated on a high and lofty throne; and the skirts of His robe filled the Temple.
Seraphs stood in attendance on Him. Each of them had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his legs, and with two he would fly.<br>
And one would call to the other,<br>“Holy, holy, holy!<br>The L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts!<br>His presence fills all the earth!”<br>
The doorposts<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> would shake at the sound of the one who called, and the House kept filling with smoke.
I cried,<br>“Woe is me; I am lost!<br>For I am a man <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., speaking impiety; cf. 9.16, and contrast “pure of speech [lit. ‘lip’]” in Zeph. 3.9.</i>of unclean lips<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>And I live among a people<br>Of unclean lips;<br>Yet my own eyes have beheld<br>The King L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts.”<br>
Then one of the seraphs flew over to me with a live coal, which he had taken from the altar with a pair of tongs.
He touched it to my lips and declared,<br><br>“Now that this has touched your lips,<br>Your guilt shall depart<br>And your sin be purged away.”<br>
Then I heard the voice of my Lord saying, “Whom shall I send? Who will go for us?” And I said, “Here am I; send me.”
And He said, “Go, say to that people:<br>‘Hear, indeed, but do not understand;<br>See, indeed, but do not grasp.’
Dull that people’s mind,<br>Stop its ears,<br>And seal its eyes—<br>Lest, seeing with its eyes<br>And hearing with its ears,<br>It also grasp with its mind,<br>And repent and save<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “heal.”</i> itself.”<br>
I asked, “How long, my Lord?” And He replied:<br>“Till towns lie waste without inhabitants<br>And houses without people,<br>And the ground lies waste and desolate—
For the L<small>ORD</small> will banish the population—<br>And deserted sites are many<br>In the midst of the land.
“But while a tenth part yet remains in it, it shall repent. It shall be ravaged like the terebinth and the oak, of which stumps are left even when they are felled: its stump shall be a holy seed.”

Chapter 7

In the reign of Ahaz son of Jotham son of Uzziah, king of Judah, King Rezin of Aram and King Pekah son of Remaliah of Israel marched upon Jerusalem to attack it; but they were not able to attack it.
Now, when it was reported to the House of David that Aram had allied itself with Ephraim, their hearts and the hearts of their people trembled as trees of the forest sway before a wind.
But the L<small>ORD</small> said to Isaiah, “Go out with your son Shear-jashub<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning “[only] a remnant will turn back,” i.e., repent; cf. 6.13; 10.21.</i> to meet Ahaz at the end of the conduit of the Upper Pool, by the road of the Fuller’s Field.
And say to him: Be firm and be calm. Do not be afraid and do not lose heart on account of those two smoking stubs of firebrands, on account of the raging of Rezin and his Arameans and the son of Remaliah.<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">To refer to a person only as “the son of—” is slighting; cf. note at 1 Sam. 10.11.</i>
Because the Arameans—with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah—have plotted against you, saying,
‘We will march against Judah and invade and conquer it, and we will set up as king in it the son of Tabeel,’<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">To refer to a person only as “the son of—” is slighting; cf. note at 1 Sam. 10.11.</i>

For the chief city of Aram is Damascus,<br>And the chief of Damascus is Rezin;

The L<small>ORD</small> spoke further to Ahaz:
“Ask for a sign from the L<small>ORD</small> your God, anywhere down to Sheol or up to the sky.”
But Ahaz replied, “I will not ask, and I will not test the L<small>ORD</small>.”
“Listen, House of David,” [Isaiah] retorted, “is it not enough for you to treat men as helpless that you also treat my God as helpless?<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">By insisting on soliciting the aid of Assyria (see 2 Kings 16.7 ff.; cf. below, v. 20). “Treat as helpless” follows the translation of Saadia; cf.

Assuredly, my Lord will give you a sign of His own accord! Look, the young woman is with child and about to give birth to a son. Let her name him Immanuel.<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning “with us is God.”</i>
(By the time he learns to reject the bad and choose the good, people will be feeding on curds and honey.)
For before the lad knows to reject the bad and choose the good, the ground whose two kings you dread shall be abandoned.
The L<small>ORD</small> will cause to come upon you and your people and your ancestral house such days as never have come since Ephraim turned away from Judah—that selfsame king of Assyria!<sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. note on v. 13.</i>
“In that day, the L<small>ORD</small> will whistle to the flies at the ends of the water channels of Egypt and to the bees in the land of Assyria;
and they shall all come and alight in the rugged wadis, and in the clefts of the rocks, and in all the thornbrakes, and in all the watering places.
“In that day, my Lord will cut away with the razor that is hired beyond the Euphrates—with the king of Assyria<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">Who was hired by Ahaz; cf. notes on vv. 13 and 17.</i>—the hair of the head and <sup class="footnote-marker">j</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the pubic hair.</i>the hair of the legs,<sup class="endFootnote">-j</sup> and it shall clip off the beard as well.
And in that day, each man shall save alive a heifer of the herd and two animals of the flock.
(And he shall obtain so much milk that he shall eat curds.) Thus everyone who is left in the land shall feed on curds and honey.
“For in that day, every spot where there could stand a thousand vines worth a thousand shekels of silver<sup class="footnote-marker">k</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., all the best farm land, corresponding to the hairiest parts of the body; v. 20.</i> shall become a wilderness of thornbush and thistle.
One will have to go there with bow and arrows,<sup class="footnote-marker">l</sup><i class="footnote">Because of dangerous beasts.</i> for the country shall be all thornbushes and thistles.
But the perils of thornbush and thistle shall not spread to any of the hills that could only be tilled with a hoe;<sup class="footnote-marker">m</sup><i class="footnote">Marginal farm land, too rocky for the plow, corresponding to areas of the body with scant hair.</i> and here cattle shall be let loose, and <sup class="footnote-marker">n</sup><i class="footnote">See note at Exod. 12.3.</i>sheep and goats<sup class="endFootnote">-n</sup> shall tramp about.”

Chapter 8

The L<small>ORD</small> said to me, “Get yourself a large sheet and write on it <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>in common script<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> ‘For Maher-shalal-hash-baz’;<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., “Pillage hastens, looting speeds,” indicating that two cities are to be pillaged at an early date; see v. 4.</i>
and call reliable witnesses, the priest Uriah and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah, to witness for Me.”
I was intimate with the prophetess,<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., Isaiah’s wife.</i> and she conceived and bore a son; and the L<small>ORD</small> said to me, “Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz.<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., “Pillage hastens, looting speeds,” indicating that two cities are to be pillaged at an early date; see v. 4.</i>
For before the boy learns to call ‘Father’ and ‘Mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria, <sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Brought up from v. 6 for clarity.</i>and the delights of Rezin and of the son of Remaliah,<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup> shall be carried off before the king of Assyria.”<br>
Again the L<small>ORD</small> spoke to me, thus:
“Because that people has spurned<br>The gently flowing waters of Siloam”<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">The conduit—and later the tunnel—of Siloam conveyed into Jerusalem the waters of Gihon, which symbolize “the Lord of Hosts who dwells on Mount Zion” (v. 18). For the nature of the rejection see note at 7.13.</i>—
Assuredly,<br>My Lord will bring up against them<br>The mighty, massive waters of the Euphrates,<br>The king of Assyria and all his multitude.<br>It shall rise above all its channels,<br>And flow over all its beds,
And swirl through Judah like a flash flood<br>Reaching up to the neck.<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., Judah shall be imperiled, but, in contrast to Aram and Ephraim (v. 4), not destroyed.</i><br><br><sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">See note c at 7.9.</i>But with us is God,<br>Whose wings are spread<br>As wide as your land is broad!
Band together, O peoples—you shall be broken!<br>Listen to this, you remotest parts of the earth:<br>Gird yourselves—you shall be broken;<br>Gird yourselves—you shall be broken!
Hatch a plot—it shall be foiled;<br>Agree on action—it shall not succeed.<br>For with us is God!<br>
For this is what the L<small>ORD</small> said to me, when He took me by the hand<sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., singled me out; cf. 41.9, 13; 42.6; 45.1; Jer. 31.32 [31].</i> and charged me not to walk in the path of that people:
<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">The Heb. forms here and in vv. 13 and 19 are plural to include the disciples (v. 16) and the children (v. 18).</i>“You must not call conspiracy<sup class="footnote-marker">j</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.

The masses shall trip over these<br>And shall fall and be injured,<br>Shall be snared and be caught.
Bind up the message,<br>Seal the instruction with My disciples.”<br>
So I will wait for the L<small>ORD</small>, who is hiding His face from the House of Jacob, and I will trust in Him.
Here stand I and the children the L<small>ORD</small> has given me as signs and portents in Israel from the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion.
Now, should people say to you, “Inquire of the ghosts and familiar spirits that chirp and moan; for a people may inquire of its divine beings<sup class="footnote-marker">l</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the shades of the dead; cf. 1 Sam. 28.13.</i>—of the dead on behalf of the living—

And now the L<small>ORD</small> said, “It is a sign and a portent for Egypt and Nubia. Just as My servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot for three years,
so shall the king of Assyria drive off the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Nubia, young and old, naked and barefoot and with bared buttocks—to the shame of Egypt!
And they shall be dismayed and chagrined because of Nubia their hope and Egypt their boast.

My Lord G<small>OD</small> of Hosts summoned on that day<br>To weeping and lamenting,<br>To tonsuring and girding with sackcloth.
Instead, there was rejoicing and merriment,<br>Killing of cattle and slaughtering of sheep,<br>Eating of meat and drinking of wine:<br>“Eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!”
Then the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts revealed Himself to my ears:<br>“This iniquity shall never be forgiven you<br>Until you die,” said my Lord G<small>OD</small> of Hosts.<br>
Thus said my Lord G<small>OD</small> of Hosts: Go in to see that steward, that Shebna, in charge of the palace:

And in that day, I will summon My servant Eliakim son of Hilkiah,
and I will invest him with your tunic, gird him with your sash, and deliver your authority into his hand; and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the men of Judah.
I will place the keys of David’s palace on his shoulders; and what he unlocks none may shut, and what he locks none may open.
He shall be a seat of honor to his father’s<sup class="footnote-marker">o</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “master’s”; cf. v. 18 end.</i> household. I will fix him as a peg in a firm place,

The new wine fails,<br>The vine languishes;<br>And all the merry-hearted sigh.

Hear now the word of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>You men of mockery,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Or “composers of taunt-verses for that people.”</i>Who govern that people<sup class="endFootnote">-g</sup><br>In Jerusalem!
For you have said,<br>“We have made a covenant with Death,<br>Concluded a pact with Sheol.<br>When the sweeping flood passes through,<br>It shall not reach us;<br>For we have made falsehood our refuge,<br>Taken shelter in treachery.”
Assuredly,<br>Thus said the Lord G<small>OD</small>:<br>“Behold, I will found in Zion,<br>Stone by stone,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>A tower of precious cornerstones,<sup class="endFootnote">-h</sup><br>Exceedingly firm;<br>He who trusts need not fear.

It shall catch you<br>Every time it passes through;<br>It shall pass through every morning,<br>Every day and every night.<br>And it shall be sheer horror<br>To grasp the message.”<br>
The couch is too short for stretching out,<br>And the cover too narrow for curling up!<br>
For the L<small>ORD</small> will arise<br>As on the hill of Perazim,<br>He will rouse Himself<br>As in the vale of Gibeon,<br>To do His work—<br>Strange is His work!<br>And to perform His task—<br>Astounding is His task!<sup class="footnote-marker">k</sup><i class="footnote">Instead of giving victory, as at Baal-perazim and Gibeon (cf. 2 Sam. 5.19–25; 1 Chron. 14.9–16), He will inflict punishment.</i>
Therefore, refrain from mockery,<br>Lest your bonds be tightened.<br>For I have heard a decree of destruction<br>From my Lord G<small>OD</small> of Hosts<br>Against all the land.<br>
Give diligent ear to my words,<br>Attend carefully to what I say.
Does he who plows to sow<br>Plow all the time,<br>Breaking up and furrowing his land?

For He teaches him the right manner,<br>His God instructs him.
So, too, black cumin is not threshed with a threshing board,<br>Nor is the wheel of a threshing sledge rolled over cumin;<br>But black cumin is beaten out with a stick<br>And cumin with a rod.
It is cereal that is crushed.<sup class="footnote-marker">m</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “threshed.”</i><br>For <sup class="footnote-marker">n</sup><i class="footnote">Taking lo as equivalent to lu.</i>even if<sup class="endFootnote">-n</sup> he threshes it thoroughly,<br>And the wheel of his sledge <sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>and his horses overwhelm it,<sup class="endFootnote">-h</sup><br>He does not crush it.

Act stupid and be stupefied!<br>Act blind and be blinded!<br>(They are drunk, but not from wine,<br>They stagger, but not from liquor.)
For the L<small>ORD</small> has spread over you<br>A spirit of deep sleep,<br>And has shut your eyes, the prophets,<br>And covered your heads, the seers;
So that all prophecy has been to you<br>Like the words of a sealed document.<br><br>If it is handed to one who can read and he is asked to read it, he will say, “I can’t, because it is sealed”;
and if the document is handed to one who cannot read and he is asked to read it, he will say, “I can’t read.”<br>
My Lord said:<br>Because that people has approached [Me] with its mouth<br>And honored Me with its lips,<br>But has kept its heart far from Me,<br>And its worship of Me has been<br>A commandment of men, learned by rote—
Truly, I shall further baffle that people<br>With bafflement upon bafflement;<br>And the wisdom of its wise shall fail,<br>And the prudence of its prudent shall vanish.<br>

Leave the way!<br>Get off the path!<br>Let us hear no more<br>About the Holy One of Israel!”<br>
Assuredly,<br>Thus said the Holy One of Israel:<br>Because you have rejected this word,<br>And have put your trust and reliance<br>In that which is fraudulent and tortuous—
Of a surety,<br>This iniquity shall work on you<br>Like a spreading breach that occurs in a lofty wall,<br>Whose crash comes sudden and swift.
It is smashed as one smashes an earthen jug,<br>Ruthlessly shattered<br>So that no shard is left in its breakage<br>To scoop coals from a brazier,<br>Or ladle water from a puddle.<br>
For thus said my Lord G<small>OD</small>,<br>The Holy One of Israel,<br>“You shall triumph by stillness and quiet;<br>Your victory shall come about<br>Through calm and confidence.”<br>But you refused.
“No,” you declared.<br>“We shall flee on steeds”—<br>Therefore you shall flee!<br>“We shall ride on swift mounts”—<br>Therefore your pursuers shall prove swift!
One thousand before the shout of one—<br>You shall flee at the shout of five;<br>Till what is left of you<br>Is like a mast on a hilltop,<br>Like a pole upon a mountain.<br>

Indeed, O people in Zion, dwellers of Jerusalem, you shall not have cause to weep. He will grant you His favor at the sound of your cry; He will respond as soon as He hears it.
My Lord will provide for you meager bread and scant water. Then your Guide will no more <sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>be ignored,<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup> but your eyes will watch your Guide;
and, whenever you deviate to the right or to the left, your ears will heed the command from behind you: “This is the road; follow it!”

So rain shall be provided for the seed with which you sow the ground, and the bread that the ground brings forth shall be rich and fat. Your livestock, in that day, shall graze in broad pastures;
as for the cattle and the asses that till the soil, they shall partake of salted fodder that has been winnowed with shovel and fan.
And on every high mountain and on every lofty hill, there shall appear brooks and watercourses—on a day of heavy slaughter, when towers topple.

Chapter 36

<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Chaps. 36–39 occur also as 2 Kings 18.13–20.19, with a number of variants, some of which will be cited here in the footnotes.</i>In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, King Sennacherib of Assyria marched against all the fortified towns of Judah and seized them.
From Lachish, the king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh,<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">An Assyrian title; cf. “Tartan,” 20.1.</i> with a large force, to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem. [The Rabshakeh] took up a position near the conduit of the Upper Pool, by the road of the Fuller’s Field;
and Eliakim son of Hilkiah who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went out to him.
The Rabshakeh said to them, “You tell Hezekiah: Thus said the Great King, the king of Assyria: What makes you so confident?
I suppose<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">2 Kings 18.20 “You must think.”</i> mere talk makes counsel and valor for war! Look, on whom are you relying, that you have rebelled against me?
You are relying on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which enters and punctures the palm of anyone who leans on it. That’s what Pharaoh king of Egypt is like to all who rely on him.
And if you tell me that you are relying on the L<small>ORD</small> your God, He is the very one whose shrines and altars Hezekiah did away with, telling Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You must worship only at this altar!’
Come now, make this wager with my master, the king of Assyria: I’ll give you two thousand horses, if you can produce riders to mount them.
So how could you refuse anything, even to the deputy of one of my master’s lesser servants, relying on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?
And do you think I have marched against this land to destroy it without the L<small>ORD</small>? The L<small>ORD</small> Himself told me: Go up against that land and destroy it.”
Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah replied to the Rabshakeh, “Please, speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it; do not speak to us in Judean in the hearing of the people on the wall.”
But the Rabshakeh replied, “Was it to your master and to you that my master sent me to speak those words? It was precisely to the men who are sitting on the wall—who will have to eat their dung and drink their urine with you.”
And the Rabshakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in Judean:
“Hear the words of the Great King, the king of Assyria! Thus said the king: Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to save you.
Don’t let Hezekiah make you rely on the L<small>ORD</small>, saying, ‘The L<small>ORD</small> will surely save us; this city will not fall into the hands of Assyria!’
Don’t listen to Hezekiah. For thus said the king of Assyria: Make your peace with me and come out to me,<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., to my representative the Rabshakeh.</i> so that you may all eat from your vines and your fig trees and drink water from your cisterns,
until I come and take you away to a land like your own, a land of bread and wine, of grain [fields] and vineyards.
Beware of letting Hezekiah mislead you by saying, ‘The L<small>ORD</small> will save us.’ Did any of the gods of the other nations save his land from the king of Assyria?
Where were the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where were the gods of Sepharvaim? And did they<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the gods of Samaria.</i> save Samaria from me?
Which among all the gods of those countries saved their countries from me, that the L<small>ORD</small> should save Jerusalem from me?”
But they were silent and did not answer him with a single word; for the king’s order was: “Do not answer him.”
And so Eliakim son of Hilkiah who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder came to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and they reported to him what the Rabshakeh had said.

Chapter 37

When King Hezekiah heard this, he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the House of the L<small>ORD</small>.
He also sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna, the scribe, and the senior priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
They said to him, “Thus said Hezekiah: This day is a day of distress, of chastisement, and of disgrace. <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the situation is desperate, and we are at a loss.</i>The babes have reached the birthstool, but the strength to give birth is lacking.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>
Perhaps the L<small>ORD</small> your God will take note of the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to blaspheme the living God, and will mete out judgment for the words that the L<small>ORD</small> your God has heard—if you will offer up prayer for the surviving remnant.”
When King Hezekiah’s ministers came to Isaiah,
Isaiah said to them, “Tell your master as follows: Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: Do not be frightened by the words of blasphemy against Me that you have heard from the minions of the king of Assyria.
I will delude<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “put a spirit in.”</i> him: He will hear a rumor and return to his land, and I will make him fall by the sword in his land.”
The Rabshakeh, meanwhile, heard that [the King] had left Lachish; he turned back and found the king of Assyria attacking Libnah.
But [the king of Assyria] learned that King Tirhakah of Nubia had come out to fight him; and when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
“Tell this to King Hezekiah of Judah: Do not let your God, on whom you are relying, mislead you into thinking that Jerusalem will not be delivered into the hands of the king of Assyria.
You yourself have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, how they have annihilated them; and can you escape?
Were the nations that my predecessors<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “fathers.”</i> destroyed—Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the Bethedenites in Telassar—saved by their gods?
Where is the king of Hamath? and the king of Arpad? and the kings of Lair, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?”
Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Hezekiah then went up to the House of the L<small>ORD</small> and spread it out before the L<small>ORD</small>.
And Hezekiah prayed to the L<small>ORD</small>:
“O L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, enthroned on the Cherubim! You alone are God of all the kingdoms of the earth. You made the heavens and the earth.
O L<small>ORD</small>, incline Your ear and hear, open Your eye and see. Hear all the words that Sennacherib has sent to blaspheme the living God!
True, O L<small>ORD</small>, the kings of Assyria have annihilated all the nations<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">So 2 Kings 19.17, and 13 mss. here; most mss. and editions read “lands.”</i> and their lands
and have committed their gods to the flames and have destroyed them; for they are not gods, but man’s handwork of wood and stone.
But now, O L<small>ORD</small> our God, deliver us from his hands, and let all the kingdoms of the earth know that You, O L<small>ORD</small>, alone [are God].”<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Supplied from 2 Kings 19.19.</i>
Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent this message to Hezekiah: “Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of Israel, to whom you have prayed, concerning King Sennacherib of Assyria—
this is the word that the L<small>ORD</small> has spoken concerning him:<br><br>Fair Maiden Zion despises you,<br>She mocks at you;<br>Fair Jerusalem shakes<br>Her head at you.
Whom have you blasphemed and reviled?<br>Against whom made loud your voice<br>And haughtily raised your eyes?<br>Against the Holy One of Israel!
Through your servants you have blasphemed my Lord.<br>Because you thought,<br>‘Thanks to my vast chariotry,<br>It is I who have climbed the highest mountains,<br>To the remotest parts of the Lebanon,<br>And have cut down its loftiest cedars,<br>Its choicest cypresses,<br>And have reached its highest peak,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “Its farmland forest”; exact meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Its densest forest.<sup class="endFootnote">-f</sup>
It is I who have drawn<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Or “dug”; meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i><br>And drunk water.<br>I have dried up with the soles of my feet<br>All the streams of Egypt.’
Have you not heard? Of old<br>I planned that very thing,<br>I designed it long ago,<br>And now have fulfilled it.<br>And it has come to pass,<br>Laying fortified towns waste in desolate heaps.
Their inhabitants are helpless,<br>Dismayed and shamed.<br>They were but grass of the field<br>And green herbage,<br>Grass of the roofs <sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">So ms. 1QIsa; cf. 2 Kings 19.26.

I know your stayings<br>And your goings and comings,<br>And how you have raged against Me,
Because you have raged against Me,<br>And your tumult has reached My ears,<br>I will place My hook in your nose<br>And My bit between your jaws;<br>And I will make you go back by the road<br>By which you came.<br>
“And this is the sign for you:<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., Hezekiah.</i> This year you eat what grows of itself, and the next year what springs from that, and in the third year sow and reap and plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
And the survivors of the House of Judah that have escaped shall renew its trunk below and produce boughs above.<br>
For a remnant shall come forth from Jerusalem,<br>Survivors from Mount Zion.<br>The zeal of the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts<br>Shall bring this to pass.<br>
“Assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small> concerning the king of Assyria:<br><br>He shall not enter this city;<br>He shall not shoot an arrow at it,<br>Or advance upon it with a shield,<br>Or pile up a siegemound against it.
He shall go back<br>By the way he came,<br>He shall not enter this city<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>;
I will protect and save this city for My sake<br>And for the sake of My servant David.”<br>
[That night]<sup class="footnote-marker">j</sup><i class="footnote">Supplied from 2 Kings 19.35.</i> an angel of the L<small>ORD</small> went out and struck down one hundred and eighty-five thousand in the Assyrian camp, and the following morning they were all dead corpses.
So King Sennacherib of Assyria broke camp and retreated, and stayed in Nineveh.
While he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, he was struck down with the sword by his sons Adrammelech and Sarezer. They fled to the land of Ararat, and his son Esarhaddon succeeded him as king.

Chapter 38

In those days Hezekiah fell dangerously ill. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came and said to him, “Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: Set your affairs in order, for you are going to die; you will not get well.”
Thereupon Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the L<small>ORD</small>.
“Please, O L<small>ORD</small>,” he said, “remember how I have walked before You sincerely and wholeheartedly, and have done what is pleasing to You.” And Hezekiah wept profusely.
Then the word of the L<small>ORD</small> came to Isaiah:
“Go and tell Hezekiah: Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of your father David: I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears. I hereby add fifteen years to your life.
I will also rescue you and this city from the hands of the king of Assyria. I will protect this city.
And this is the sign for you from the L<small>ORD</small> that the L<small>ORD</small> will do the thing that He has promised:
I am going to make the shadow on the steps, which has descended on the dial<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “steps.” A model of a dial with steps has been discovered in Egypt.</i> of Ahaz because of the sun, recede ten steps.” And the sun[’s shadow] receded ten steps, the same steps as it had descended.
A poem by King Hezekiah of Judah when he recovered from the illness he had suffered:<br>

I piped like a swift or a swallow,<br>I moaned like a dove,<br>As my eyes, all worn, looked to heaven:<br>“My Lord, I am in straits;<br>Be my surety!”<br>
What can I say? <sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>He promised me,<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup><br>And He it is who has wrought it.<br><sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup>All my sleep had fled<br>Because of the bitterness of my soul.
My Lord, for all that and despite it<br>My life-breath is revived;<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup><br>You have restored me to health and revived me.
Truly, it was for my own good<br>That I had such great bitterness:<br>You saved my life<br>From the pit of destruction,<br>For You have cast behind Your back<br>All my offenses.
For it is not Sheol that praises You,<br>Not [the Land of] Death that extols You;<br>Nor do they who descend into the Pit<br>Hope for Your grace.

When Isaiah said, “Let them take a cake of figs and apply it to the rash, and he will recover,”
Hezekiah asked, “What will be the sign that I shall go up to the House of the L<small>ORD</small>?”

Chapter 39

At that time, Merodach-baladan son of Baladan, the king of Babylon, sent [envoys with] a letter and a gift to Hezekiah, for he had heard about his illness and recovery.
Hezekiah was pleased by their coming, and he showed them his treasure house—the silver, the gold, the spices, and the fragrant oil—and all his armory, and everything that was to be found in his storehouses. There was nothing in his palace or in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them.
Then the prophet Isaiah came to King Hezekiah. “What,” he demanded of him, “did those men say to you? Where have they come to you from?” “They have come to me,” replied Hezekiah, “from a far country, from Babylon.”
Next he asked, “What have they seen in your palace?” And Hezekiah replied, “They have seen everything there is in my palace. There was nothing in my storehouses that I did not show them.”
Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts:
A time is coming when everything in your palace, which your ancestors have stored up to this day, will be carried off to Babylon; nothing will be left behind, said the L<small>ORD</small>.
And some of your sons, your own issue, whom you will have fathered, will be taken to serve as eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.”
Hezekiah declared to Isaiah, “The word of the L<small>ORD</small> that you have spoken is good.” For he thought, “It means that <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “there shall be safety and faithfulness in.”</i>safety is assured for<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> my time.”

You shall winnow them<br>And the wind shall carry them off;<br>The whirlwind shall scatter them.<br>But you shall rejoice in the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>And glory in the Holy One of Israel.<br>
The poor and the needy<br>Seek water,<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., on the homeward march through the desert.</i> and there is none;<br>Their tongue is parched with thirst.<br>I the L<small>ORD</small> will respond to them.<br>I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.

Chapter 42

This is My servant, whom I uphold,<br>My chosen one, in whom I delight.<br>I have put My spirit upon him,<br>He shall teach the true way to the nations.
He shall not cry out or shout aloud,<br>Or make his voice heard in the streets.

Thus said God the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>Who created the heavens and stretched them out,<br>Who spread out the earth and what it brings forth,<br>Who gave breath to the people upon it<br>And life to those who walk thereon:
I the L<small>ORD</small>, in My grace, have summoned you,<br>And I have grasped you by the hand.<br>I created you, and appointed you<br>A <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “covenants of a people”; meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>covenant people,<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup> <sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">See 49.6 and note.</i>a light of nations<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup>—

See, the things once predicted have come,<br>And now I foretell new things,<br>Announce to you ere they sprout up.

Let them do honor to the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>And tell His glory in the coastlands.<br>
The L<small>ORD</small> goes forth like a warrior,<br>Like a fighter He whips up His rage.<br>He yells, He roars aloud,<br>He charges upon His enemies.
“I have kept silent <sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “from of old.”</i>far too long,<sup class="endFootnote">-f</sup><br>Kept still and restrained Myself;<br>Now I will scream like a woman in labor,<br>I will pant and I will gasp.

If only you would listen to this,<br>Attend and give heed from now on!

So He poured out wrath upon them,<br>His anger and the fury of war.<br>It blazed upon them all about, but they heeded not;<br>It burned among them, but they gave it no thought.

Chapter 43

But now thus said the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>Who created you, O Jacob,<br>Who formed you, O Israel:<br>Fear not, for I will redeem you;<br>I have singled you out by name,<br>You are Mine.
When you pass through water,<br>I will be with you;<br>Through streams,<br>They shall not overwhelm you.<br>When you walk through fire,<br>You shall not be scorched;<br>Through flame,<br>It shall not burn you.
For I the L<small>ORD</small> am your God,<br>The Holy One of Israel, your Savior.<br>I give Egypt as a ransom for you,<br>Nubia and Saba in exchange for you.
Because you are precious to Me,<br>And honored, and I love you,<br>I give men in exchange for you<br>And peoples in your stead.
Fear not, for I am with you:<br>I will bring your folk from the East,<br>Will gather you out of the West;
I will say to the North, “Give back!”<br>And to the South, “Do not withhold!<br>Bring My sons from afar,<br>And My daughters from the end of the earth—
All who are linked to My name,<br>Whom I have created,<br>Formed, and made for My glory—
Setting free that people,<br>Blind though it has eyes<br>And deaf though it has ears.”
All the nations assemble as one,<br>The peoples gather.<br>Who among them declared this,<br>Foretold to us the things that have happened?<br>Let them produce their witnesses and be vindicated,<br>That men, hearing them, may say, “It is true!”<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., that the other nations’ gods are real.</i>

None but me, the L<small>ORD</small>;<br>Beside Me, none can grant triumph.
I alone foretold the triumph<br>And I brought it to pass;<br>I announced it,<br>And no strange god was among you.<br>So you are My witnesses<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>And I am God.
Ever since day was, I am He;<br>None can deliver from My hand.<br>When I act, who can reverse it?<br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>Your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:<br>For your sake <sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>I send to Babylon;<br>I will bring down all [her] bars,<br>And the Chaldeans shall raise their voice in lamentation.<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup>
I am your Holy One, the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>Your King, the Creator of Israel.<br>

Who destroyed<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Understanding hoṣi, here, as equivalent to Aramaic sheṣi.</i> chariots and horses,<br>And all the mighty host—<br>They lay down to rise no more,<br>They were extinguished, quenched like a wick:

The people I formed for Myself<br>That they might declare My praise.<br>
But you have not worshiped Me, O Jacob,<br>That you should be weary of Me, O Israel.
You have not brought Me your sheep for burnt offerings,<br>Nor honored Me with your sacrifices.<br>I have not burdened you with meal offerings,<br>Nor wearied you about frankincense.
You have not bought Me fragrant reed with money,<br>Nor sated Me with the fat of your sacrifices.<br>Instead, you have burdened Me with your sins,<br>You have wearied Me with your iniquities.

Chapter 44

But hear, now, O Jacob My servant,<br>Israel whom I have chosen!
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>, your Maker,<br>Your Creator who has helped you since birth:<br>Fear not, My servant Jacob,<br>Jeshurun<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">A name for Israel; see note on Num. 23.10; cf. Deut. 32.15; 33.5, 26.</i> whom I have chosen,
Even as I pour water on thirsty soil,<br>And rain upon dry ground,<br>So will I pour My spirit on your offspring,<br>My blessing upon your posterity.
And they shall sprout like<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “in among.”</i> grass,<br>Like willows by watercourses.
One shall say, “I am the L<small>ORD</small>’s,”<br>Another shall use the name of “Jacob,”<br>Another shall mark his arm “of the L<small>ORD</small>”<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">It was customary to mark a slave with the owner’s name.</i><br>And adopt the name of “Israel.”<br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>, the King of Israel,<br>Their Redeemer, the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts:<br>I am the first and I am the last,<br>And there is no god but Me.

Do not be frightened, do not be shaken!<br>Have I not from of old predicted to you?<br>I foretold, and you are My witnesses.<br>Is there any god, then, but Me?<br>“There is no other rock; I know none!”<br>
The makers of idols<br>All work to no purpose;<br>And the things they treasure<br>Can do no good,<br>As they themselves can testify.<br>They neither look nor think,<br>And so they shall be shamed.
Who would fashion a god<br>Or cast a statue<br>That can do no good?
Lo, all its adherents shall be shamed;<br>They are craftsmen, are merely human.<br>Let them all assemble and stand up!<br>They shall be cowed, and they shall be shamed.<br>

They do not give thought,<br>They lack the wit and judgment to say:<br>“Part of it I burned in a fire;<br>I also baked bread on the coals,<br>I roasted meat and ate it—<br>Should I make the rest an abhorrence?<br>Should I bow to a block of wood?”

I was angry at My people,<br>I defiled My heritage;<br>I put them into your hands,<br>But you showed them no mercy.<br>Even upon the aged you made<br>Your yoke exceedingly heavy.
You thought, “I shall always be<br>The mistress still.”<br>You did not take these things to heart,<br>You gave no thought to the end of it.<br>
And now hear this, O pampered one—<br>Who dwell in security,<br>Who think to yourself,<br>“I am, and there is none but me;<br>I shall not become a widow<br>Or know loss of children”—
These two things shall come upon you,<br>Suddenly, in one day:<br>Loss of children and widowhood<br>Shall come upon you in full measure,<br>Despite your many enchantments<br>And all your countless spells.
You were secure in your wickedness;<br>You thought, “No one can see me.”<br>It was your skill and your science<br>That led you astray.<br>And you thought to yourself,<br>“I am, and there is none but me.”
Evil is coming upon you<br>Which you will not know how to <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.

See, they are become like straw,<br>Fire consumes them;<br>They cannot save themselves<br>From the power of the flame;<br>This is no coal for warming oneself,<br>No fire to sit by!
This is what they have profited you—<br>The traders you dealt with since youth—<br>Each has wandered off his own way,<br>There is none to save you.

Chapter 48

Long ago, I foretold things that happened,<br>From My mouth they issued, and I announced them;<br>Suddenly I acted, and they came to pass.
Because I know how stubborn you are<br>(Your neck is like an iron sinew<br>And your forehead bronze),
Therefore I told you long beforehand,<br>Announced things to you ere they happened—<br>That you might not say, “My idol caused them,<br>My carved and molten images ordained them.”
You have <sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>heard all this; look, must you not acknowledge it?<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup><br>As of now, I announce to you new things,<br>Well-guarded secrets you did not know.

Listen to Me, O Jacob,<br>Israel, whom I have called:<br>I am He—I am the first,<br>And I am the last as well.
My own hand founded the earth,<br>My right hand spread out the skies.<br><br>I call unto them, let them stand up.
Assemble, all of you, and listen!<br>Who among you<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “them.”</i> foretold these things:<br><sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>“He whom the L<small>ORD</small> loves<br>Shall work His will against Babylon,<br>And, with His might, against Chaldea”?<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup>
I, I predicted, and I called him;<br>I have brought him and he shall succeed in his mission.
Draw near to Me and hear this:<br>From the beginning, I did not speak in secret;<br>From the time anything existed, I was there.<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., I foretold it through prophets.</i><br><br>“And now the Lord G<small>OD</small> has sent me, <sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “and His spirit.”</i>endowed with His spirit.”<sup class="endFootnote">-h</sup><br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> your Redeemer,<br>The Holy One of Israel:<br>I the L<small>ORD</small> am your God,<br>Instructing you for your own benefit.<br>Guiding you in the way you should go.
If only you would heed My commands!<br>Then your prosperity would be like a river,<br>Your triumph like the waves of the sea.
Your offspring would be as many as the sand,<br>Their issue as many as its grains.<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i><br>Their name would never be cut off<br>Or obliterated from before Me.<br>
Go forth from Babylon,<br>Flee from Chaldea!<br>Declare this with loud shouting,<br>Announce this,<br>Bring out the word to the ends of the earth!<br>Say: “The L<small>ORD</small> has redeemed<br>His servant Jacob!”
They have known no thirst,<br>Though He led them through parched places;<br>He made water flow for them from the rock;<br>He cleaved the rock and water gushed forth.<br>
There is no safety—said the L<small>ORD</small>—for the wicked.

Chapter 49

Listen, O coastlands, to me,<br>And give heed, O nations afar:<br>The L<small>ORD</small> appointed me before I was born,<br>He named me while I was in my mother’s womb.
He made my mouth like a sharpened blade,<br>He hid me in the shadow of His hand,<br>And He made me like a polished arrow;<br>He concealed me in His quiver.
And He said to me, “You are My servant,<br>Israel in whom I glory.”
I thought, “I have labored in vain,<br>I have spent my strength for empty breath.”<br>But my case rested with the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>My recompense was in the hands of my God.
And now the L<small>ORD</small> has resolved—<br>He who formed me in the womb to be His servant—<br>To bring back Jacob to Himself,<br>That Israel may be restored to Him.<br>And I have been honored in the sight of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>My God has been my strength.
For He has said:<br>“It is too little that you should be My servant<br>In that I raise up the tribes of Jacob<br>And restore the survivors of Israel:<br>I will also make you a light<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the agent of good fortune; cf. 42.1–4; 51.4–5.</i> of nations,<br>That My salvation may reach the ends of the earth.”<br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>The Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain. Emendation yields “Whose being is despised, / Whose body is detested”; cf. 51.23.</i>To the despised one,<br>To the abhorred nations,<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>To the slave of rulers:<br>Kings shall see and stand up;<br>Nobles, and they shall prostrate themselves—<br>To the honor of the L<small>ORD</small>, who is faithful,<br>To the Holy One of Israel who chose you.
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>In an hour of favor I answer you,<br>And on a day of salvation I help you—<br>I created you and appointed you <sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">See note b-b at 42.6.</i>a covenant people<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup>—<br>Restoring the land,<br>Allotting anew the desolate holdings,
Saying to the prisoners, “Go free,”<br>To those who are in darkness, “Show yourselves.”<br>They shall pasture along the roads,<br>On every bare height shall be their pasture.
They shall not hunger or thirst,<br>Hot wind and sun shall not strike them;<br>For He who loves them will lead them,<br>He will guide them to springs of water.
I will make all My mountains a road,<br>And My highways shall be built up.
Look! These are coming from afar,<br>These from the north and the west,<br>And these from the land of Sinim.<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">1QIsa reads “the Syenians”; cf. Ezek. 30.6.</i>
Shout, O heavens, and rejoice, O earth!<br>Break into shouting, O hills!<br>For the L<small>ORD</small> has comforted His people,<br>And has taken back His afflicted ones in love.<br>
Zion says,<br>“The L<small>ORD</small> has forsaken me,<br>My Lord has forgotten me.”
Can a woman forget her baby,<br>Or disown the child of her womb?<br>Though she might forget,<br>I never could forget you.
See, I have engraved you<br>On the palms of My hands,<br>Your walls are ever before Me.
Swiftly your children are coming;<br>Those who ravaged and ruined you shall leave you.
Look up all around you and see:<br>They are all assembled, are come to you!<br>As I live<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>You shall don them all like jewels,<br>Deck yourself with them like a bride.
As for your ruins and desolate places<br>And your land laid waste—<br>You shall soon be crowded with settlers,<br>While destroyers stay far from you.
The children <sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “of your bereavement.”</i>you thought you had lost<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup><br>Shall yet say in your hearing,<br>“The place is too crowded for me;<br>Make room for me to settle.”
And you will say to yourself,<br>“Who bore these for me<br>When I was bereaved and barren,<br>Exiled and disdained<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>—<br>By whom, then, were these reared?<br>I was left all alone—<br>And where have these been?”<br>
Thus said the Lord G<small>OD</small>:<br>I will raise My hand to nations<br>And lift up My ensign to peoples;<br>And they shall bring your sons in their bosoms,<br>And carry your daughters on their backs.
Kings shall tend your children,<br>Their queens shall serve you as nurses.<br>They shall bow to you, face to the ground,<br>And lick the dust of your feet.<br>And you shall know that I am the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>Those who trust in Me shall not be shamed.<br>
Can spoil be taken from a warrior,<br>Or captives retrieved from a victor?
Yet thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>Captives shall be taken from a warrior<br>And spoil shall be retrieved from a tyrant;<br>For <i>I </i>will contend with your adversaries,<br>And <i>I </i>will deliver your children.
I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh,<br>They shall be drunk with their own blood as with wine.<br>And all mankind shall know<br>That I the L<small>ORD</small> am your Savior,<br>The Mighty One of Jacob, your Redeemer.

Because you fast in strife and contention,<br>And you strike with a wicked fist!<br>Your fasting today is not such<br>As to make your voice heard on high.
Is such the fast I desire,<br>A day for men to starve their bodies?<br>Is it bowing the head like a bulrush<br>And lying in sackcloth and ashes?<br>Do you call that a fast,<br>A day when the L<small>ORD</small> is favorable?

No, the L<small>ORD</small>’s arm is not too short to save,<br>Or His ear too dull to hear;
But your iniquities have been a barrier<br>Between you and your God,<br>Your sins have made Him turn His face away<br>And refuse to hear you.
For your hands are defiled with crime<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Or “blood.”</i><br>And your fingers with iniquity.<br>Your lips speak falsehood,<br>Your tongue utters treachery.

They hatch adder’s eggs<br>And weave spider webs;<br>He who eats of those eggs will die,<br>And if one is crushed, it hatches out a viper.
Their webs will not serve as a garment,<br>What they make cannot serve as clothing;<br>Their deeds are deeds of mischief,<br>Their hands commit lawless acts,
Their feet run after evil,<br>They hasten to shed the blood of the innocent.<br>Their plans are plans of mischief,<br>Destructiveness and injury are on their roads.
They do not care for the way of integrity,<br>There is no justice on their paths.<br>They make their courses crooked,<br>No one who walks in them cares for integrity.<br>
“That is why redress is far from us,<br>And vindication does not reach us.<br>We hope for light, and lo! there is darkness;<br>For a gleam, and we must walk in gloom.

For I had planned a day of vengeance,<br>And My year of redemption arrived.
Then I looked, but there was none to help;<br>I stared, but there was none to aid—<br>So My own arm wrought the triumph,<br>And <sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Many mss. read weṣidqathi “My victorious [right hand]”; cf. 59.16.</i>My own rage<sup class="endFootnote">-f</sup> was My aid.

But now, O L<small>ORD</small>, You are our Father;<br>We are the clay, and You are the Potter,<br>We are all the work of Your hands.
Be not implacably angry, O L<small>ORD</small>,<br>Do not remember iniquity forever.<br>Oh, look down to Your people, to us all!
Your holy cities have become a desert:<br>Zion has become a desert,<br>Jerusalem a desolation.
