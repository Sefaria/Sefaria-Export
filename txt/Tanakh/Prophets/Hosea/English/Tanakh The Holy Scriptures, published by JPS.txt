Hosea



Chapter 1

The word of the L<small>ORD</small> that came to Hosea son of Beeri, in the reigns of Kings Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah, and in the reign of King Jeroboam son of Joash of Israel.<br>
When the L<small>ORD</small> first spoke to Hosea, the L<small>ORD</small> said to Hosea, “Go, get yourself <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Force of Heb. uncertain.</i>a wife of whoredom and children of whoredom; for the land will stray<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “whore away.”</i> from following the L<small>ORD</small>.”<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>
So he went and married Gomer daughter of Diblaim. She conceived and bore him a son,
and the L<small>ORD</small> instructed him, “Name him Jezreel; for, I will soon punish the House of Jehu<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “Israel”; cf. next note.</i> for the <sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">See 1 Kings 21.1–24; 2 Kings 9.21–35. Emendation yields “the Baal days”; cf. 2.15.</i>bloody deeds at Jezreel<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup> and put an end to the monarchy of the House of Israel.
In that day, I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel.”
She conceived again and bore a daughter; and He said to him, “Name her Lo-ruhamah;<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., “Not-accepted”; cf. 2.3, 6, and 25.</i> for I will no longer accept the House of Israel <sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain; emendation yields “but will disown them”; cf. 9.15 and elsewhere.</i>or pardon them.<sup class="endFootnote">-f</sup> 
(But I will accept the House of Judah. And I will give them victory through the L<small>ORD</small> their God; I will not give them victory with bow and sword and battle, by horses and riders.)”
After weaning Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and bore a son.
Then He said, “Name him Lo-ammi;<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., “Not-My-People.”</i> for you<sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., you and your fellow countrymen.</i> are not My people, and <sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. 2.25.</i>I will not be your [God].”<sup class="endFootnote">-i</sup>

Chapter 2

<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Vv. 1–3 anticipate the conclusion of the chapter.</i>The number of the people of Israel shall be like that of the sands of the sea, which cannot be measured or counted; and instead of being told, “You are Not-My-People,”<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">See 1.9.</i> they shall be called Children-of-the-Living-God.
The people of Judah and the people of Israel shall assemble together and appoint one head over them; and they shall rise from the ground<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, perhaps, “from their wretched condition,” or “to ascendancy over the land.”</i>—for marvelous shall be <sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the day when the name Jezreel will convey a promise (2.23–25) instead of a threat (1.4–5).</i>the day of Jezreel!<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup>
Oh, call<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">The Lord addresses Hosea and his fellow North Israelites; see 1.9. The mother is the nation; her children the individual North Israelites.</i> your brothers “My People,”<br>And your sisters “Lovingly Accepted!”<br>
Rebuke<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">The Lord addresses Hosea and his fellow North Israelites; see 1.9. The mother is the nation; her children the individual North Israelites.</i> your mother, rebuke her—<br>For she is not My wife<br>And I am not her husband—<br>And let her put away her harlotry from her face<br>And her adultery from between her breasts.
Else will I strip her naked<br>And leave her as on the day she was born:<br>And I will make her like a wilderness,<br>Render her like desert land,<br>And let her die of thirst.
I will also disown her children;<br>For they are now a harlot’s brood,
In that their mother has played the harlot,<br>She that conceived them has acted shamelessly—<br>Because she thought,<br>“I will go after my lovers,<br>Who supply my bread and my water,<br>My wool and my linen,<br>My oil and my drink.”<br>
Assuredly,<br>I will hedge up her<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “your.” Vv. 8–9 would read well after v. 15.</i> roads with thorns<br>And raise walls against her,<br>And she shall not find her paths.
Pursue her lovers as she will,<br>She shall not overtake them;<br>And seek them as she may,<br>She shall never find them.<br>Then she will say,<br>“I will go and return<br>To my first husband,<br>For then I fared better than now.”
And she did not consider this:<br>It was I who bestowed on her<br>The new grain and wine and oil;<br>I who lavished silver on her<br>And gold—which they used for Baal.
Assuredly,<br>I will take back My new grain in its time<br>And My new wine in its season,<br>And I will snatch away My wool and My linen<br>That serve to cover her nakedness.
Now will I uncover her shame<br>In the very sight of her lovers,<br>And none shall save her from Me.
And I will end all her rejoicing:<br>Her festivals, new moons, and sabbaths—<br>All her festive seasons.
I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees,<br>Which she thinks are a fee<br>She received from her lovers;<br>I will turn them into brushwood,<br>And beasts of the field shall devour them.
Thus will I punish her<br>For the days of the Baalim,<br>On which she brought them offerings;<br>When, decked with earrings and jewels,<br>She would go after her lovers,<br>Forgetting Me<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>
Assuredly,<br>I will speak coaxingly to her<br>And lead her through the wilderness<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., her ravaged land (see vv. 5, 10–11, 14); so Ibn Ezra.</i><br>And speak to her tenderly.
I will give her her vineyards from there,<br>And the Valley of Achor<sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">A desolate region; cf. Isa. 65.10; see further Josh. 7.25–26.</i> as a <sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">Connecting pethaḥ with pittaḥ “to plow” (see Isa. 28.24). Meaning of Heb. uncertain; others “door of hope.”</i>plowland of hope.<sup class="endFootnote">-i</sup><br>There she shall respond as in the days of her youth,<br>When she came up from the land of Egypt.
And in that day<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>You will call [Me] Ishi,<sup class="footnote-marker">j</sup><i class="footnote">Both Ishi and Baali mean “my husband,” but the latter also means “my Baal.”</i><br>And no more will you call Me Baali.<sup class="footnote-marker">j</sup><i class="footnote">Both Ishi and Baali mean “my husband,” but the latter also means “my Baal.”</i>
For I will remove the names of the Baalim from her mouth,<br>And they shall nevermore be mentioned by name.<br>
In that day, I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, the birds of the air, and the creeping things of the ground; I will also banish<sup class="footnote-marker">k</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “break.”</i> bow, sword, and war from the land. Thus I will let them lie down in safety.<br>
And I will espouse you forever:<br>I will espouse you <sup class="footnote-marker">l</sup><i class="footnote">As the bride-price which the bridegroom will pay, He will confer these qualities on her, so that she will never offend again.</i>with righteousness and justice,<br>And with goodness and mercy,
And I will espouse you with faithfulness;<sup class="endFootnote">-l</sup><br>Then you shall be devoted to the L<small>ORD</small>.
In that day,<br>I will respond<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>I will respond to the sky,<br>And it shall respond to the earth;
And the earth shall respond<br>With new grain and wine and oil,<br>And they shall respond to Jezreel.<sup class="footnote-marker">m</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., “God sows.” The names of Hosea’s children (1.3–8) are applied here to Israel.</i>
I will sow her in the land as My own;<br>And take Lo-ruhamah back in favor;<br>And I will say to Lo-ammi, “You are My people,”<br>And he will respond, “[You are] my God.”

Chapter 3

The L<small>ORD</small> said to me further, “Go, <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">For “befriend,” see Deut. 10.19. For God’s befriending Israel, see Hos. 2.10.</i>befriend a woman who, while befriended by a companion, consorts with others, just as the L<small>ORD</small> befriends the Israelites,<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> but they turn <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain; emendation yields “‘to other gods.’ And so I befriended a woman of lust.”</i>to other gods and love the cups of the grape.”<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
Then I hired her for fifteen [shekels of] silver, a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley, and <sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Septuagint reads “a jar of wine.”</i>a <i>lethech</i> of barley;<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup>
and I stipulated with her, <sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “for me.”</i>“In return,<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup> you are to go a long time without either fornicating or marrying; even I [shall not cohabit] with you.”
For the Israelites shall go a long time without king and without officials, without sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “altar.”</i> and without cult pillars, and without ephod and teraphim.
Afterward, the Israelites will turn back and will seek the L<small>ORD</small> their God and David their king—and they will thrill over the L<small>ORD</small> and over His bounty in the days to come.

Chapter 4

Hear the word of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>O people of Israel!<br>For the L<small>ORD</small> has a case<br>Against the inhabitants of this land,<br>Because there is no honesty and no goodness<br>And no obedience to God in the land.
[False] swearing, dishonesty, and murder,<br>And theft and adultery are rife;<br>Crime follows upon crime!
For that, the earth is withered:<br>Everything that dwells on it languishes—<br>Beasts of the field and birds of the sky—<br>Even the fish of the sea perish.<br>
“Let no man rebuke, let no man protest!”<br><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">For failing to reprove; but meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>For this your people has a grievance against [you],<br>O priest!<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>
So you shall stumble by day,<br>And by night <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “your children”; cf. v. 6 end.</i>a prophet<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup> shall stumble as well,<br>And I will destroy your kindred.<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “mother.”</i>
My people is destroyed because of [your] disobedience!<br>Because you have rejected obedience,<br>I reject you as My priest;<br>Because you have spurned the teaching of your God,<br>I, in turn, will spurn your children.
The more they increased, the more they sinned against Me:<br>I will change their dignity to dishonor.
They feed on My people’s sin offerings,<br>And so they desire its iniquity.
Therefore, the people shall fare like the priests:<br>I will punish it for its conduct,<br>I will requite it for its deeds.
Truly, they shall eat, but not be sated;<br>They shall swill,<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">For this meaning of hiznah cf. v. 18.</i> but not be satisfied,<br>Because they have forsaken the L<small>ORD</small><br>To practice<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. 12.7.</i>
lechery.<br>Wine<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “New grain”; cf. 7.14; 9.1–2.</i> and new wine destroy<br>The mind of
My people:<br>It consults its stick,<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., its phallus, meaning “its lust.”</i><br>Its rod<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., its phallus, meaning “its lust.”</i> directs it!<br>A lecherous impulse has made them go wrong,<br>And they have strayed<sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">See note b at 1.2.</i> from submission to their God.
They sacrifice on the mountaintops<br>And offer on the hills,<br>Under oaks, poplars, and terebinths<br>Whose shade is so pleasant.<br>That is why their<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “your,” here and through v. 14.</i> daughters fornicate<br>And their daughters-in-law commit adultery!
I will not punish their daughters for fornicating<br>Nor their daughters-in-law for committing adultery;<br>For they themselves <sup class="footnote-marker">j</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>turn aside<sup class="endFootnote">-j</sup> with whores<br>And sacrifice with prostitutes,<br>And a people that is without sense<sup class="footnote-marker">k</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. vv. 11–12.</i> must stumble.
If you are a lecher, Israel—<br>Let not Judah incur guilt—<br>Do not come to Gilgal,<sup class="footnote-marker">l</sup><i class="footnote">One who participates in the debaucheries of the open-air shrines is not fit to visit a temple building.</i><br>Do not make pilgrimages to Beth-aven,<sup class="footnote-marker">m</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “House of Delusion,” substituted for Bethel (cf. Amos 4.4).</i><br>And do not swear by the L<small>ORD</small>!<sup class="footnote-marker">n</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., you are not fit to profess His religion; see Jer. 12.16.</i><br>
Ah, Israel has balked<br>Like a stubborn cow;<br>Therefore,<br>The L<small>ORD</small> will graze him<br>On the range, like a sheep.<sup class="footnote-marker">o</sup><i class="footnote">Instead of giving them fodder in return for their work; cf. Isa. 30.23–24.</i>
<sup class="footnote-marker">p</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of vv. 17–19 uncertain in part.</i>Ephraim is addicted to images—<br>Let him be.
They drink to excess—<br>Their liquor turns against them.<br>They “love” beyond measure—<br>Disgrace is the “gift”
Which the wind <sup class="footnote-marker">q</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “has bound up in the corners of its garment”; see note at Mal. 3.20.</i>is bringing;<sup class="endFootnote">-q</sup><br>They shall garner shame from their sacrifices.

Chapter 5

Hear this, O priests,<br>Attend, O House<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “prophets.”</i> of Israel,<br>And give ear, O royal house;<br>For right conduct is your responsibility!<br>But you have been a snare to Mizpah<br>And a net spread out over Tabor;
<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>For when trappers dug deep pitfalls,<br>I was the only reprover of them all.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
Yes, I have watched Ephraim,<br>Israel has not escaped my notice:<br>Behold, you have fornicated, O Ephraim;<br>Israel has defiled himself!
Their habits do not let them<br>Turn back to their God;<br>Because of the lecherous impulse within them,<br>They pay no heed to the L<small>ORD</small>.
<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">This passage would read well after 5.15; cf. 5.6 with 6.6.</i>Israel’s pride shall be humbled before his very eyes,<br>As Israel and Ephraim fall because of their sin<br>(And Judah falls with them).
Then they will go with their sheep and cattle<br>To seek the L<small>ORD</small>, but they will not find Him.<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup><br><br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>He has cast them off:<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
[Because] they have broken faith with the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>Because <sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “He has.”</i>they have<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup> begotten<br>Alien children.<br>Therefore, <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>the new moon<br>Shall devour their portion.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>
Sound a ram’s horn in Gibeah,<br>A trumpet in Ramah;<br>Give the alarm in Beth-aven;<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">The three towns named, in the territory of Benjamin, are now being wrested from Israel by Judah; see v. 10.</i><br><sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “Stir up.”</i>After you,<sup class="endFootnote">-f</sup> Benjamin!
Ephraim is stricken with horror<br>On a day of chastisement.<br><br>Against the tribes<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the kingdoms of Judah and Israel (Ephraim).</i> of Israel<br>I proclaim certainties:
The officers of Judah have acted<br>Like shifters of field boundaries;<br>On them I will pour out<br>My wrath like water.
Ephraim is defrauded,<br>Robbed of redress,<br>Because he has witlessly<br>Gone after futility.<sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Targum and Septuagint; but meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>
For it is I who am like rot to Ephraim,<br>Like decay to the House of Judah;<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “Israel.”</i>
Yet when Ephraim became aware of his sickness,<br>Judah<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “Israel.”</i> of his sores,<br>Ephraim repaired to Assyria—<br>He sent envoys to a patron<sup class="footnote-marker">j</sup><i class="footnote">Compare the verb ryb in the sense of “to champion, uphold the cause of,” in Isa. 1.17; 3.13; 19.20 end; 51.22.</i> king!<br>He will never be able to cure you,<br>Will not heal you of your sores.
No, I will be like a lion to Ephraim,<br>Like a great beast to the House of Judah;<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “Israel.”</i><br>I, I will attack and stride away,<br>Carrying the prey that no one can rescue;
And I will return to My abode—<br>Till they realize their guilt.<br>In their distress, they will seek Me<br>And beg for My favor.

Chapter 6

<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">As anticipated at the end of chapter 5, Israel seeks the Lord’s favor; His answer begins with v. 4.</i>“Come, let us turn back to the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>He attacked, and He can heal us;<br>He wounded, and He can bind us up.
In two days He will make us whole again;<br>On the third day He will raise us up,<br>And we shall be whole by His favor.
Let us pursue obedience to the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>And we shall become obedient.<br>His appearance is as sure as daybreak,<br>And He will come to us like rain,<br>Like latter rain that refreshes<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Taking yoreh as equivalent of yarweh.</i> the earth.”<br>
What can I do for you, Ephraim,<br>What can I do for you, Judah,<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “Israel”; cf. “Ephraim…Israel” in v. 10.</i><br>When your goodness is like morning clouds,<br>Like dew so early gone?

Chapter 7

When I would heal Israel,<br>The guilt of Ephraim reveals itself<br>And the wickedness of Samaria.<br>For they have acted treacherously,<br>With thieves breaking in<br>And bands raiding outside.
And they do not consider<br>That I remembered all their wickedness.<br>Why, their misdeeds have been all around them,<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “Me.”</i><br>They have been ever before Me.<br>

Though Israel’s pride has been humbled<br>Before his very eyes,<br>They have not turned back<br>To their God the L<small>ORD</small>;<br>They have not sought Him<br>In spite of everything.
Instead, Ephraim has acted<br>Like a silly dove with no mind:<br>They have appealed to Egypt!<br>They have gone to Assyria!
