Hosea



Chapter 1

The word of G<small>OD</small> that came to Hosea son of Beeri, in the reigns of Kings Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah, and in the reign of King Jeroboam son of Joash of Israel.
When G<small>OD</small> first spoke to Hosea, G<small>OD</small> said to Hosea, “Go, get yourself a wife of whoredom and children of whoredom; for the land will stray<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote"><b>stray </b>Lit. “whore away.”</i> from following G<small>OD</small>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote"><b>a wife of whoredom and children of whoredom; for the land will stray from following G<small>OD</small> </b>Force of Heb. uncertain.</i> 
So he went and married Gomer daughter of Diblaim. She conceived and bore him a son, 
and G<small>OD</small> instructed him, “Name him Jezreel; for, I will soon punish the House of Jehu<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Jehu </b>Emendation yields “Israel”; cf. next note.</i> for the bloody deeds at Jezreel<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote"><b>bloody deeds at Jezreel </b>See 1 Kings 21.1–24; 2 Kings 9.21–35. Emendation yields “the Baal days”; cf. 2.15.</i> and put an end to the monarchy of the House of Israel. 
In that day, I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel.”
She conceived again and bore a daughter; and he was told, “Name her Lo-ruhamah;<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Lo-ruhamah </b>I.e., “Not-accepted” or “Unpitied”; cf. 2.3, 6, 25.</i> for I will no longer accept the House of Israel or pardon them.<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote"><b>or pardon them </b>Meaning of Heb. uncertain; emendation yields “but will disown them”; cf. 9.15 and elsewhere.</i> 
(But I will accept the House of Judah. And I will give them victory through the E<small>TERNAL</small> their God; I will not give them victory with bow and sword and battle, by horses and riders.)”
After weaning Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and bore a son. 
Then [God] said, “Name him Lo-ammi;<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Lo-ammi </b>I.e., “Not-My-People.”</i> for you<sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote"><b>you </b>I.e., you and your fellow countrymen.</i> are not My people, and I will not be your [God].”<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote"><b>I will not be your [God] </b>Cf. 2.25.</i> 

Chapter 2

<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Vv. 1–3 anticipate the conclusion of the chapter.</i> The number of the people of Israel shall be like that of the sands of the sea, which cannot be measured or counted; and instead of being told, “You are Not-My-People,”<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote"><b>You are Not-My-People </b>See 1.9.</i> they shall be called Children-of-the-Living-God.

Chapter 3

G<small>OD</small>
 said to me further, “Go, befriend a woman who, while befriended<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote"><b>befriend…befriended </b>For this sense, see Deut. 10.19.</i> by a companion, consorts with others, just as G<small>OD</small> befriends the Israelites,<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote"><b>just as G<small>OD</small> befriends the Israelites </b>See Hos. 2.10.</i> but they turn to other gods and love the cups of the grape.”<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote"><b>to other gods and love the cups of the grape </b>Meaning of Heb. uncertain; emendation yields “‘to other gods.’ And so I befriended a woman of lust.”</i>

For the Israelites shall go a long time without king and without officials, without sacrifice<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote"><b>sacrifice </b>Emendation yields “altar.”</i> and without cult pillars, and without ephod and oracle idols. 
Afterward, the Israelites will turn back and will seek the E<small>TERNAL</small> their God and David their king—and they will thrill over G<small>OD</small> and over God’s bounty in the days to come.
