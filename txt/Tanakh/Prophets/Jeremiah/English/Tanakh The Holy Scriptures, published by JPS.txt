Jeremiah



Chapter 1

The words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, one of the priests at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin.
The word of the L<small>ORD</small> came to him in the days of King Josiah son of Amon of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign,
and throughout the days of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah, and until the end of the eleventh year of King Zedekiah son of Josiah of Judah, when Jerusalem went into exile in the fifth month.<br>
The word of the L<small>ORD</small> came to me:<br>
Before I created you in the womb, I selected you;<br>Before you were born, I consecrated you;<br>I appointed you a prophet concerning the nations.
I replied:<br>Ah, Lord G<small>OD</small>!<br>I don’t know how to speak,<br>For I am still a boy.
And the L<small>ORD</small> said to me:<br>Do not say, “I am still a boy,”<br>But go wherever I send you<br>And speak whatever I command you.
Have no fear of them,<br>For I am with you to deliver you<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>
The L<small>ORD</small> put out His hand and touched my mouth, and the L<small>ORD</small> said to me: Herewith I put My words into your mouth.
See, I appoint you this day<br>Over nations and kingdoms:<br>To uproot and to pull down,<br>To destroy and to overthrow,<br>To build and to plant.<br>
The word of the L<small>ORD</small> came to me: What do you see, Jeremiah? I replied: I see a branch of an almond tree.<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. shaqed.</i>
The L<small>ORD</small> said to me:<br>You have seen right,<br>For I am watchful<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. shoqed.</i> to bring My word to pass.<br>
And the word of the L<small>ORD</small> came to me a second time: What do you see? I replied:<br>I see a steaming pot,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Tipped away from the north.<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup>
And the L<small>ORD</small> said to me:<br>From the north shall disaster break loose<br>Upon all the inhabitants of the land!
For I am summoning all the peoples<br>Of the kingdoms of the north<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>They shall come, and shall each set up a throne<br>Before the gates of Jerusalem,<br>Against its walls round about,<br>And against all the towns of Judah.
And I will argue My case against them<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., against Jerusalem and Judah.</i><br>For all their wickedness:<br>They have forsaken Me<br>And sacrificed to other gods<br>And worshiped the works of their hands.<br>
So you, gird up your loins,<br>Arise and speak to them<br>All that I command you.<br>Do not break down before them,<br>Lest I break you before them.
I make you this day<br>A fortified city,<br>And an iron pillar,<br>And bronze walls<br>Against the whole land—<br>Against Judah’s kings and officers,<br>And against its priests and citizens.<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “the people of the land.”</i>
They will attack you,<br>But they shall not overcome you;<br>For I am with you—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—to save you.

Chapter 2

The word of the L<small>ORD</small> came to me, saying,
Go proclaim to Jerusalem: Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>I accounted to your favor<br>The devotion of your youth,<br>Your love as a bride—<br>How you followed Me in the wilderness,<br>In a land not sown.
Israel was holy to the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>The first fruits of His harvest.<br>All who ate of it were held guilty;<br>Disaster befell them<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>
Hear the word of the L<small>ORD</small>, O House of Jacob,<br>Every clan of the House of Israel!
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>What wrong did your fathers find in Me<br>That they abandoned Me<br>And went after delusion and were deluded?
They never asked themselves, “Where is the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>Who brought us up from the land of Egypt,<br>Who led us through the wilderness,<br>A land of deserts and pits,<br>A land of drought and darkness,<br>A land no man had traversed,<br>Where no human being had dwelt?”
I brought you to this country of farm land<br>To enjoy its fruit and its bounty;<br>But you came and defiled My land,<br>You made My possession abhorrent.
The priests never asked themselves, “Where is the L<small>ORD</small>?”<br>The guardians of the Teaching ignored Me;<br>The rulers<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “shepherds”; cf. 3.15; 23.1 ff.</i> rebelled against Me,<br>And the prophets prophesied by Baal<br>And followed what can do no good.<br>
Oh, I will go on accusing you<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>And I will accuse your children’s children!
Just cross over to the isles of the Kittim and look,<br>Send to Kedar and observe carefully;<br>See if aught like this has ever happened:
Has any nation changed its gods<br>Even though they are no-gods?<br>But My people has exchanged its glory<br>For what can do no good.
Be appalled, O heavens, at this;<br>Be horrified, utterly dazed!<br>—says the L<small>ORD</small>.
For My people have done a twofold wrong:<br>They have forsaken Me, the Fount of living waters,<br>And hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns,<br>Which cannot even hold water.<br>
Is Israel a bondman?<br>Is he a home-born slave?<br>Then why is he given over to plunder?
Lions have roared over him,<br>Have raised their cries.<br>They have made his land a waste,<br>His cities desolate, without inhabitants.
Those, too, in Noph and Tahpanhes<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Cities in Egypt. The Egyptians, like the Assyrians, will prove a disappointment; cf. v. 36.</i><br><sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Will lay bare<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup> your head.
See, <sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “that is what your forsaking the Lord your God is doing to you.”</i>that is the price you have paid<br>For forsaking the L<small>ORD</small> your God<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup><br><sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>While He led you in the way.<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup>
What, then, is the good of your going to Egypt<br>To drink the waters of the Nile?<br>And what is the good of your going to Assyria<br>To drink the waters of the Euphrates?
Let your misfortune reprove you,<br>Let your afflictions rebuke you;<br>Mark well how bad and bitter it is<br>That you forsake the L<small>ORD</small> your God,<br>That awe for Me is not in you<br>—declares the Lord G<small>OD</small> of Hosts.
For long ago you<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">For the form, cf. shaqqamti, Judg. 5.7; others “I.”</i> broke your yoke,<br>Tore off your yoke-bands,<br>And said, “I will not work!”<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Following the kethib; qere “transgress.”</i><br>On every high hill and under every verdant tree,<br>You recline as a whore.
I planted you with noble vines,<br>All with choicest seed;<br>Alas, I find you changed<br>Into a base, an alien vine!
Though you wash with natron<br>And use much lye,<br>Your guilt is ingrained before Me<br>—declares the Lord G<small>OD</small>.
How can you say, “I am not defiled,<br>I have not gone after the Baalim”?<br>Look at your deeds in the Valley,<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., of Hinnom; cf. 7.31–32; 32.35.</i><br>Consider what you have done!<br>Like a lustful she-camel,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Restlessly running about,<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup>
Or like a wild ass used to the desert,<br>Snuffing the wind in her eagerness,<br>Whose passion none can restrain,<br>None that seek her need grow weary—<br>In her season, they’ll find her!<br>
Save your foot from going bare,<br>And your throat from thirst.<br>But you say, “It is no use.<br>No, I love the strangers,<sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., other gods.</i><br>And after them I must go.”
Like a thief chagrined when he is caught,<br>So is the House of Israel chagrined—<br>They, their kings, their officers,<br>And their priests and prophets.
They said to wood, “You are my father,”<br>To stone, “You gave birth to me,”<br>While to Me they turned their backs<br>And not their faces.<br>But in their hour of calamity they cry,<br>“Arise and save us!”
And where are those gods<br>You made for yourself?<br>Let them arise and save you, if they can,<br>In your hour of calamity.<br>For your gods have become, O Judah,<br>As many as your towns!
Why do you call Me to account?<br>You have all rebelled against Me<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
To no purpose did I smite your children;<br>They would not accept correction.<br>Your sword has devoured your prophets<br>Like a ravening lion.
<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>O generation, behold<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup> the word of the L<small>ORD</small>!<br>Have I been like a desert to Israel,<br>Or like a land of deep gloom?<br>Then why do My people say, “We have broken loose,<br>We will not come to You any more?”
Can a maiden forget her jewels,<br>A bride her adornments?<br>Yet My people have forgotten Me—<br>Days without number.<br>
How skillfully you plan your way<br>To seek out love!<br>Why, you have even taught<br>The worst of women your ways.
Moreover, on your garments is found<br>The lifeblood of the innocent poor—<br>You did not catch them breaking in.<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">In which case there might have been an excuse for killing them; cf. Exod. 22.1.</i><br><sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Yet, despite all these things,<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup>
You say, “I have been acquitted;<br>Surely, His anger has turned away from me.”<br>Lo, I will bring you to judgment<br>For saying, “I have not sinned.”<br>
How you cheapen yourself,<br>By changing your course!<br>You shall be put to shame through Egypt,<br>Just as you were put to shame through Assyria.
From this way, too, you will come out<br><sup class="footnote-marker">j</sup><i class="footnote">A gesture of wild grief; cf. 2 Sam. 13.19.</i>With your hands on your head;<sup class="endFootnote">-j</sup><br>For the L<small>ORD</small> has rejected those you trust,<br>You will not prosper with them.

Chapter 3

[The word of the L<small>ORD</small> came to me] as follows: If a man divorces his wife, and she leaves him and marries another man, can he ever go back to her? Would not such a land be defiled?<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Deut. 24.1–4.</i> Now you have whored with many lovers: can you return to Me?—says the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>
Look up to the bare heights, and see:<br>Where have they not lain with you?<br>You waited for them on the roadside<br>Like a bandit<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “Arab.”</i> in the wilderness.<br>And you defiled the land<br>With your whoring and your debauchery.
And when showers were withheld<br>And the late rains did not come,<br>You had the brazenness<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “forehead.”</i> of a street woman,<br>You refused to be ashamed.
Just now you called to Me, “Father!<br>You are the Companion of my youth.
Does one hate<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Akkadian parallels nada¯ru and shama¯ru.</i> for all time?<br>Does one rage<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Akkadian parallels nada¯ru and shama¯ru.</i> forever?”<br>That is how you spoke;<br>You did wrong, and <sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>had your way.<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup><br>
The L<small>ORD</small> said to me in the days of King Josiah: Have you seen what Rebel Israel did, going to every high mountain and under every leafy tree, and whoring there?
I thought: After she has done all these things, she will come back to Me. But she did not come back; and her sister, Faithless Judah, saw it.
I noted: Because Rebel Israel had committed adultery, I cast her off and handed her a bill of divorce; yet her sister, Faithless Judah, was not afraid—she too went and whored.
Indeed, the land was defiled by her casual immorality, as she committed adultery with stone and with wood.<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">She deserted her God for idols of stone and wood.</i>
And after all that, her sister, Faithless Judah, did not return to Me wholeheartedly, but insincerely—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
And the L<small>ORD</small> said to me: Rebel Israel has shown herself more in the right than Faithless Judah.
Go, make this proclamation toward the north, and say: Turn back, O Rebel Israel—declares the L<small>ORD</small>. I will not look on you in anger, for I am compassionate—declares the L<small>ORD</small>; I do not bear a grudge for all time.
Only recognize your sin; for you have transgressed against the L<small>ORD</small> your God, and scattered your favors<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “ways.”</i> among strangers under every leafy tree, and you have not heeded Me—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>
Turn back, rebellious children—declares the L<small>ORD</small>. Since I have espoused<sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. ba‘alti uncertain; compare 31.32.</i> you, I will take you, one from a town and two from a clan, and bring you to Zion.
And I will give you shepherds<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> after My own heart, who will pasture you with knowledge and skill.
And when you increase and are fertile in the land, in those days—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—men shall no longer speak of the Ark of the Covenant of the L<small>ORD</small>, nor shall it come to mind. They shall not mention it, or miss it, or make another.
At that time, they shall call Jerusalem “Throne of the L<small>ORD</small>,” and all nations shall assemble there, in the name of the L<small>ORD</small>, at Jerusalem. They<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., Israel and Judah.</i> shall no longer follow the willfulness of their evil hearts.
In those days, the House of Judah shall go with the House of Israel; they shall come together from the land of the north to the land I gave your fathers as a possession.
I had resolved to adopt you as My child, and I gave you a desirable land—the fairest heritage of all the nations; and I thought you would surely call Me “Father,” and never cease to be loyal to Me.
Instead, you have broken faith with Me, as a woman breaks faith with a paramour, O House of Israel—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>
Hark! On the bare heights is heard<br>The suppliant weeping of the people of Israel,<br>For they have gone a crooked way,<br>Ignoring the L<small>ORD</small> their God.<br>
Turn back, O rebellious children,<br>I will heal your afflictions!<br><br>“Here we are, we come to You,<br>For You, O L<small>ORD</small>, are our God!
<sup class="footnote-marker">j</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the pagan rites celebrated on the hills are futile; exact force of Heb. uncertain.</i>Surely, futility comes from the hills,<br>Confusion from the mountains.<sup class="endFootnote">-j</sup><br>Only through the L<small>ORD</small> our God<br>Is there deliverance for Israel.
But the Shameful Thing<sup class="footnote-marker">k</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. Bosheth, a contemptuous substitute for Baal.</i> has consumed<br>The possessions of our fathers ever since our youth—<br>Their flocks and herds,<br>Their sons and daughters.
Let us lie down in our shame,<br>Let our disgrace cover us;<br>For we have sinned against the L<small>ORD</small> our God,<br>We and our fathers from our youth to this day,<br>And we have not heeded the L<small>ORD</small> our God.”

Chapter 4

If you return, O Israel<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>If you return to Me,<br>If you remove your abominations from My presence<br>And do not waver,
And <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., profess the worship of the Lord.</i>swear, “As the L<small>ORD</small> lives,”<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br>In sincerity, justice, and righteousness—<br>Nations shall bless themselves by you<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “him.”</i><br>And praise themselves by you.<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “him.”</i>
For thus said the L<small>ORD</small> to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem:<br><br>Break up the untilled ground,<br>And do not sow among thorns.
Open<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “circumcise”; cf. Deut. 10.16 and 30.6.</i> your hearts to the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>Remove the thickening about your hearts—<br>O men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem—<br>Lest My wrath break forth like fire,<br>And burn, with none to quench it,<br>Because of your wicked acts.<br>
Proclaim in Judah,<br>Announce in Jerusalem,<br>And say:<br>“Blow the horn in the land!”<br>Shout aloud and say:<br>“Assemble, and let us go<br>Into the fortified cities!”
Set up a signpost: To Zion.<br>Take refuge, do not delay!<br>For I bring evil from the north,<br>And great disaster.
The lion has come up from his thicket:<br>The destroyer of nations has set out,<br>Has departed from his place,<br>To make your land a desolation;<br>Your cities shall be ruined,<br>Without inhabitants.
For this, put on sackcloth,<br>Mourn and wail;<br>For the blazing anger of the L<small>ORD</small><br>Has not turned away from us.
And in that day<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>The mind of the king<br>And the mind of the nobles shall fail,<br>The priests shall be appalled,<br>And the prophets shall stand aghast.<br>
<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Septuagint reads “And they shall say.”</i>And I said:<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup> Ah, Lord G<small>OD</small>! Surely You have deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying:<br>It shall be well with you—<br>Yet the sword threatens the very life!<br>
At that time, it shall be said concerning this people and Jerusalem:<br>The conduct of <sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “the daughter that is My people”; so, frequently, in poetry.</i>My poor people<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup> is like searing wind<br>From the bare heights of the desert—<br>It will not serve to winnow or to fan.
A full blast from them comes against Me:<br>Now I in turn will bring charges against them.<br>
Lo, he<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the invader of v. 7.</i> ascends like clouds,<br>His chariots are like a whirlwind,<br>His horses are swifter than eagles.<br>Woe to us, we are ruined!
Wash your heart clean of wickedness,<br>O Jerusalem, that you may be rescued.<br>How long will you harbor within you<br>Your evil designs?<br>
Hark, one proclaims from Dan<br>And announces calamity from Mount Ephraim!
Tell the nations: Here they are!<br>Announce concerning Jerusalem:<br>Watchers<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the invader of v. 7.</i> are coming from a distant land,<br>They raise their voices against the towns of Judah.
Like guards of fields, they surround her on every side.<br>For she has rebelled against Me<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
Your conduct and your acts<br>Have brought this upon you;<br>This is your bitter punishment;<br>It pierces your very heart.<br>
Oh, my suffering,<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “entrails.”</i> my suffering!<br>How I writhe!<br>Oh, the walls of my heart!<br>My heart moans within me,<br>I cannot be silent;<br>For <sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “you, O my being, hear.” Change of vocalization yields “I hear the blare of horns, / My inner being, alarms of war.”</i>I hear<sup class="endFootnote">-h</sup> the blare of horns,<br>Alarms of war.
Disaster overtakes disaster,<br>For all the land has been ravaged.<br>Suddenly my tents have been ravaged,<br>In a moment, my tent cloths.
How long must I see standards<br>And hear the blare of horns?<br>
For My people are stupid,<br>They give Me no heed;<br>They are foolish children,<br>They are not intelligent.<br>They are clever at doing wrong,<br>But unable to do right.<br>
I look at the earth,<br>It is unformed and void;<br>At the skies,<br>And their light is gone.
I look at the mountains,<br>They are quaking;<br>And all the hills are rocking.
I look: no man is left,<br>And all the birds of the sky have fled.
I look: the farm land is desert,<br>And all its towns are in ruin—<br>Because of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>Because of His blazing anger.
For thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>The whole land shall be desolate,<br>But I will not make an end of it.
For this the earth mourns,<br>And skies are dark above—<br>Because I have spoken, I have planned,<br>And I will not relent or turn back from it.<br>
At the shout of horseman and bowman<br>The whole city flees.<br>They enter the thickets,<br>They clamber up the rocks.<br>The whole city is deserted,<br>Not a man remains there.
And you, who are doomed to ruin,<br>What do you accomplish by wearing crimson,<br>By decking yourself in jewels of gold,<br>By enlarging your eyes with kohl?<br>You beautify yourself in vain:<br>Lovers despise you,<br>They seek your life!
I hear a voice as of one in travail,<br>Anguish as of a woman bearing her first child,<br>The voice of Fair Zion<br>Panting, stretching out her hands:<br>“Alas for me! I faint<br>Before the killers!”

Chapter 5

Roam the streets of Jerusalem,<br>Search its squares,<br>Look about and take note:<br>You will not find a man,<br>There is none who acts justly,<br>Who seeks integrity—<br>That I should pardon her.
Even when they say, “As the L<small>ORD</small> lives,”<br>They are sure to be swearing falsely.
O L<small>ORD</small>, Your eyes look for integrity.<br>You have struck them, but they sensed no pain;<br>You have consumed them, but they would accept no discipline.<br>They made their faces harder than rock,<br>They refused to turn back.<br>
Then I thought: These are just poor folk;<br>They act foolishly;<br>For they do not know the way of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>The rules of their God.
So I will go to the wealthy<br>And speak with them:<br>Surely they know the way of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>The rules of their God.<br>But they as well had broken the yoke,<br>Had snapped the bonds.
Therefore,<br>The lion of the forest strikes them down,<br>The wolf of the desert ravages them.<br>A leopard lies in wait by their towns;<br>Whoever leaves them will be torn in pieces.<br>For their transgressions are many,<br>Their rebellious acts unnumbered.<br>
Why should I forgive you?<br>Your children have forsaken Me<br>And sworn by no-gods.<br>When I fed them their fill,<br>They committed adultery<br>And went trooping to the harlot’s house.
They were <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>well-fed, lusty<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> stallions,<br>Each neighing at another’s wife.
Shall I not punish such deeds?<br>—says the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>Shall I not bring retribution<br>On a nation such as this?
Go up among her vines<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “rows.”</i> and destroy;<br>Lop off her trailing branches,<br>For they are not of the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>(But do not make an end.)
For the House of Israel and the House of Judah<br>Have betrayed Me<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
They have been false to the L<small>ORD</small><br>And said: “<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Or “Not He”; cf. Deut. 32.39; Isa. 43.13.</i>It is not so!<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup><br>No trouble shall come upon us,<br>We shall not see sword or famine.
The prophets shall prove mere wind<br>For the Word is not in them;<br>Thus-and-thus shall be done to them!”<br>
Assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>The God of Hosts:<br>Because they<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “you.”</i> said that,<br>I am putting My words into your mouth as fire,<br>And this people shall be firewood,<br>Which it will consume.
Lo, I am bringing against you, O House of Israel,<br>A nation from afar<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>;<br>It is an enduring nation,<br>It is an ancient nation;<br>A nation whose language you do not know—<br>You will not understand what they say.
<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “Whose mouths.”</i>Their quivers<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup> are like a yawning grave—<br>They are all mighty men.
They will devour your harvest and food,<br>They will devour your sons and daughters,<br>They will devour your flocks and herds,<br>They will devour your vines and fig trees.<br>They will batter down with the sword<br>The fortified towns on which you rely.<br>
But even in those days—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—I will not make an end of you.
And when they<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “you.”</i> ask, “Because of what did the L<small>ORD</small> our God do all these things?” you shall answer them, “Because you forsook Me and served alien gods on your own land, you will have to serve foreigners in a land not your own.”<br>
Proclaim this to the House of Jacob<br>And announce it in Judah:
Hear this, O foolish people,<br>Devoid of intelligence,<br>That have eyes but can’t see,<br>That have ears but can’t hear!
Should you not revere Me<br>—says the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>Should you not tremble before Me,<br>Who set the sand as a boundary to the sea,<br>As a limit for all time, not to be transgressed?<br>Though its waves toss, they cannot prevail;<br>Though they roar, they cannot pass it.
Yet this people has a wayward and defiant heart;<br>They have turned aside and gone their way.
They have not said to themselves,<br>“Let us revere the L<small>ORD</small> our God,<br>Who gives the rain,<br>The early and late rain in season,<br>Who keeps for our benefit<br>The weeks appointed for harvest.”
It is your iniquities that have diverted these things,<br>Your sins that have withheld the bounty from you.
For among My people are found wicked men,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Who lurk, like fowlers lying in wait;<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br>They set up a trap to catch men.
As a cage is full of birds,<br>So their houses are full of guile;<br>That is why they have grown so wealthy.
They have become fat and sleek;<br>They <sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Some ancient versions read “have transgressed My words for evil.”</i>pass beyond the bounds of wickedness,<sup class="endFootnote">-f</sup><br>And they prosper.<br>They will not judge the case of the orphan,<br>Nor give a hearing to the plea of the needy.
Shall I not punish such deeds<br>—says the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>Shall I not bring retribution<br>On a nation such as this?
An appalling, horrible thing<br>Has happened in the land:
The prophets prophesy falsely,<br>And the priests <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>rule accordingly;<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br>And My people like it so.<br>But what will you do at the end of it?

Chapter 6

Chapter 7

The word which came to Jeremiah from the L<small>ORD</small>:
Stand at the gate of the House of the L<small>ORD</small>, and there proclaim this word: Hear the word of the L<small>ORD</small>, all you of Judah who enter these gates to worship the L<small>ORD</small>!
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: Mend your ways and your actions, and I will <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain. Change of vocalization yields “dwell with you”; so Aquila and Vulgate.</i>let you dwell<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> in this place.
Don’t put your trust in illusions and say, “The Temple of the L<small>ORD</small>, the Temple of the L<small>ORD</small>, the Temple of the L<small>ORD</small> are these [buildings].”
No, if you really mend your ways and your actions; if you execute justice between one man and another;
if you do not oppress the stranger, the orphan, and the widow; if you do not shed the blood of the innocent in this place; if you do not follow other gods, to your own hurt—
then only will I <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain. Change of vocalization yields “dwell with you”; so Aquila and Vulgate.</i>let you dwell<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers for all time.
See, you are relying on illusions that are of no avail.
Will you steal and murder and commit adultery and swear falsely, and sacrifice to Baal, and follow other gods whom you have not experienced,<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">See note at Deut. 11.28.</i>
and then come and stand before Me in this House which bears My name and say, “We are safe”?—[Safe] to do all these abhorrent things!
Do you consider this House, which bears My name, to be a den of thieves? As for Me, I have been watching—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
Just go to My place at Shiloh, where I had established My name formerly, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of My people Israel.
And now, because you do all these things—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—and though I spoke to you persistently, you would not listen; and though I called to you, you would not respond—
therefore I will do to the House which bears My name, on which you rely, and to the place which I gave you and your fathers, just what I did to Shiloh.
And I will cast you out of My presence as I cast out your brothers, the whole brood of Ephraim.
As for you, do not pray for this people, do not raise a cry of prayer on their behalf, do not plead with Me; for I will not listen to you.
Don’t you see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
The children gather sticks, the fathers build the fire, and the mothers knead dough, to make cakes for the Queen of Heaven,<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the mother goddess (Ishtar, Astarte) in whose honor these cakes were baked.</i> and they pour libations to other gods, to vex Me.
Is it Me they are vexing?—says the L<small>ORD</small>. It is rather themselves, to their own disgrace.
Assuredly, thus said the Lord G<small>OD</small>: My wrath and My fury will be poured out upon this place, on man and on beast, on the trees of the field and the fruit of the soil. It shall burn, with none to quench it.<br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: Add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices and eat the meat!
For when I freed your fathers from the land of Egypt, I did not speak with them or command them concerning burnt offerings or sacrifice.
But this is what I commanded them: Do My bidding, that I may be your God and you may be My people; walk only in the way that I enjoin upon you, that it may go well with you.
Yet they did not listen or give ear; they followed their own counsels, the willfulness of their evil hearts. They have gone backward, not forward,
from the day your fathers left the land of Egypt until today. And though I kept sending all My servants, the prophets, to them<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “you.”</i> daily and persistently,
they would not listen to Me or give ear. They stiffened their necks, they acted worse than their fathers.<br>
You shall say all these things to them, but they will not listen to you; you shall call to them, but they will not respond to you.
Then say to them: This is the nation that would not obey the L<small>ORD</small> their God, that would not accept rebuke. Faithfulness has perished, vanished from their mouths.<br>
Shear your locks and cast them away,<br>Take up a lament on the heights,<br>For the L<small>ORD</small> has spurned and cast off<br>The brood that provoked His wrath.<br>
For the people of Judah have done what displeases Me—declares the L<small>ORD</small>. They have set up their abominations in the House which is called by My name, and they have defiled it.
And they have built the shrines of Topheth in the Valley of Ben-hinnom to burn their sons and daughters in fire—which I never commanded, which never came to My mind.
Assuredly, a time is coming—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—when men shall no longer speak of Topheth or the Valley of Ben-hinnom, but of the Valley of Slaughter; and they shall bury in Topheth until no room is left.
The carcasses of this people shall be food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth, with none to frighten them off.
And I will silence in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem the sound of mirth and gladness, the voice of bridegroom and bride. For the whole land shall fall to ruin.

Chapter 8

At that time—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—the bones of the kings of Judah, of its officers, of the priests, of the prophets, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be taken out of their graves
and exposed to the sun, the moon, and all the host of heaven which they loved and served and followed, to which they turned and bowed down. They shall not be gathered for reburial; they shall become dung upon the face of the earth.
And death shall be preferable to life for all that are left of this wicked folk, in all the other places to which I shall banish them—declares the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts.<br>
Say to them: Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>When men fall, do they not get up again?<br>If they turn aside, do they not turn back?
Why is this people—Jerusalem—rebellious<br>With a persistent rebellion?<br>They cling to deceit,<br>They refuse to return.
I have listened and heard:<br>They do not speak honestly.<br>No one regrets his wickedness<br>And says, “What have I done!”<br>They all persist in their wayward course<br>Like a steed dashing forward in the fray.
Even the stork in the sky knows her seasons,<br>And the turtledove, swift, and crane<br>Keep the time of their coming;<br>But My people pay no heed<br>To the law of the L<small>ORD</small>.
How can you say, “We are wise,<br>And we possess the Instruction of the L<small>ORD</small>”?<br>Assuredly, for naught has the pen labored,<br>For naught the scribes!
The wise shall be put to shame,<br>Shall be dismayed and caught;<br>See, they reject the word of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>So their wisdom amounts to nothing.<br>
Assuredly, I will give their wives to others,<br>And their fields to dispossessors;<br>For from the smallest to the greatest,<br>They are all greedy for gain;<br>Priest and prophet alike,<br>They all act falsely.
They offer healing offhand<br>For the wounds of My poor people,<br>Saying, “All is well, all is well,”<br>When nothing is well.
They have acted shamefully;<br>They have done abhorrent things—<br>Yet they do not feel shame,<br>They cannot be made to blush.<br>Assuredly, they shall fall among the falling,<br>They shall stumble at the time of their doom<br>—said the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>
<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain; change of vocalization yields “Their fruit harvest has been gathered in.”</i>I will make an end of them<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>No grapes left on the vine,<br>No figs on the fig tree,<br>The leaves all withered;<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Whatever I have given them is gone.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
Why are we sitting by?<br>Let us gather into the fortified cities<br>And meet our doom there.<br>For the L<small>ORD</small> our God has doomed us,<br>He has made us drink a bitter draft,<br>Because we sinned against the L<small>ORD</small>.
We hoped for good fortune, but no happiness came;<br>For a time of relief—instead there is terror!
The snorting of their horses was heard from Dan;<br>At the loud neighing of their steeds<br>The whole land quaked.<br>They came and devoured the land and what was in it,<br>The towns and those who dwelt in them.
Lo, I will send serpents against you,<br>Adders that cannot be charmed,<br>And they shall bite you<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>

The outcry of my poor people<br>From the land far and wide:
“Harvest is past,<br>Summer is gone,<br>But we have not been saved.”
Because my people is shattered I am shattered;<br>I am dejected, seized by desolation.
Is there no balm in Gilead?<br>Can no physician be found?<br>Why has healing not yet<br>Come to my poor people?
Oh, that my head were water,<br>My eyes a fount of tears!<br>Then would I weep day and night<br>For the slain of my poor people.

Chapter 9

Oh, to be in the desert,<br>At an encampment for wayfarers!<br>Oh, to leave my people,<br>To go away from them—<br>For they are all adulterers,<br>A band of rogues.<br>
They bend their tongues like bows;<br>They are valorous in the land<br>For treachery, not for honesty;<br>They advance from evil to evil.<br>And they do not heed Me<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
Beware, every man of his friend!<br>Trust not even a brother!<br>For every brother takes advantage,<br>Every friend <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">See note at Lev. 19.16.</i>is base in his dealings.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>

Assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts:<br>Lo, I shall smelt and assay them—<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>For what else can I do because of My poor people?<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
Their tongue is a sharpened arrow,<br>They use their mouths to deceive.<br>One speaks to his fellow in friendship,<br>But lays an ambush for him in his heart.
Shall I not punish them for such deeds?<br>—says the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>Shall I not bring retribution<br>On such a nation as this?<br>
For the mountains I take up weeping and wailing,<br>For the pastures in the wilderness, a dirge.<br>They are laid waste; no man passes through,<br>And no sound of cattle is heard.<br>Birds of the sky and beasts as well<br>Have fled and are gone.<br>
I will turn Jerusalem into rubble,<br>Into dens for jackals;<br>And I will make the towns of Judah<br>A desolation without inhabitants.<br>
What man is so wise<br>That he understands this?<br>To whom has the L<small>ORD</small>’s mouth spoken,<br>So that he can explain it:<br>Why is the land in ruins,<br>Laid waste like a wilderness,<br>With none passing through?<br>
The L<small>ORD</small> replied: Because they forsook the Teaching I had set before them. They did not obey Me and they did not follow it,
but followed their own willful heart and followed the Baalim, as their fathers had taught them.
Assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: I am going to feed that people wormwood and make them drink a bitter draft.
I will scatter them among nations which they and their fathers never knew; and I will dispatch the sword after them until I have consumed them.<br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts:<br>Listen!<br>Summon the dirge-singers, let them come;<br>Send for the skilled women, let them come.
Let them quickly start a wailing for us,<br>That our eyes may run with tears,<br>Our pupils flow with water.<br>
For the sound of wailing<br>Is heard from Zion:<br>How we are despoiled!<br>How greatly we are shamed!<br>Ah, we must leave our land,<br>Abandon<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “They abandoned.”</i> our dwellings!<br>
Hear, O women, the word of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>Let your ears receive the word of His mouth,<br>And teach your daughters wailing,<br>And one another lamentation.
For death has climbed through our windows,<br>Has entered our fortresses,<br>To cut off babes from the streets,<br>Young men from the squares.<br>
Speak thus—says the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>The carcasses of men shall lie<br>Like dung upon the fields,<br>Like sheaves behind the reaper,<br>With none to pick them up.<br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom;<br>Let not the strong man glory in his strength;<br>Let not the rich man glory in his riches.
But only in this should one glory:<br>In his earnest devotion to Me.<br>For I the L<small>ORD</small> act with kindness,<br>Justice, and equity in the world;<br>For in these I delight<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>
Lo, days are coming—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—when I will take note of everyone <sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Force of Heb. uncertain.</i>circumcised in the foreskin:<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup>

Hear the word which the L<small>ORD</small> has spoken to you, O House of Israel!<br>

Chastise me, O L<small>ORD</small>, but in measure;<br>Not in Your wrath, lest You reduce me to naught.
Pour out Your wrath on the nations who have not heeded You,<br>Upon the clans that have not invoked Your name.<br>For they have devoured Jacob,<br>Have devoured and consumed him,<br>And have laid desolate his homesteads.

Chapter 11

The word which came to Jeremiah from the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>
“Hear the terms of this covenant, and recite them to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem!
And say to them, Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of Israel: Cursed be the man who will not obey the terms of this covenant,
which I enjoined upon your fathers when I freed them from the land of Egypt, the iron crucible, saying, ‘Obey Me and observe them,<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the terms of the covenant.</i> just as I command you, that you may be My people and I may be your God’—
in order to fulfill the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as is now the case.” And I responded, “Amen, L<small>ORD</small>.”
And the L<small>ORD</small> said to me, “Proclaim all these things through the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem: Hear the terms of this covenant, and perform them.
For I have repeatedly and persistently warned your fathers from<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “at.”</i> the time I brought them out of Egypt to this day, saying: Obey My commands.
But they would not listen or give ear; they all followed the willfulness of their evil hearts. So I have brought upon them all the terms<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the punishments prescribed for violation.</i> of this covenant, because they did not do what I commanded them to do.”
The L<small>ORD</small> said to me, “A conspiracy exists among the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
They have returned to the iniquities of their fathers of old, who refused to heed My words. They, too, have followed other gods and served them. The House of Israel and the House of Judah have broken the covenant that I made with their fathers.”
Assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: I am going to bring upon them disaster from which they will not be able to escape. Then they will cry out to me, but I will not listen to them.
And the townsmen<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “towns.”</i> of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to which they sacrifice; but they will not be able to rescue them in their time of disaster.
For your gods have become as many as your towns, O Judah, and you have set up as many altars to Shame<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">See note at 3.24.</i> as there are streets in Jerusalem—altars for sacrifice to Baal.
As for you, do not pray for this people, do not raise a cry of prayer on their behalf; for I will not listen when they call to Me on account of their disaster.<br>

O L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, O just Judge,<br>Who test the thoughts and the mind,<br>Let me see Your retribution upon them,<br>For I lay my case before You.<br>
Assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts concerning the men of Anathoth who seek your life and say, “You must not prophesy any more in the name of the L<small>ORD</small>, or you will die by our hand”—
Assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts: “I am going to deal with them: the young men shall die by the sword, their boys and girls shall die by famine.
No remnant shall be left of them, for I will bring disaster on the men of Anathoth, the year of their doom.”

You will win,<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “be in the right.”</i> O L<small>ORD</small>, if I make claim against You,<br>Yet I shall present charges against You:<br>Why does the way of the wicked prosper?<br>Why are the workers of treachery at ease?
You have planted them, and they have taken root,<br>They spread, they even bear fruit.<br>You are present in their mouths,<br>But far from their thoughts.
Yet You, L<small>ORD</small>, have noted and observed me;<br>You have tested my heart, and found it with You.<br>Drive them out like sheep to the slaughter,<br>Prepare them for the day of slaying!<br>

My own people<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “possession”; the land as well as the people, as is clear in v. 14.</i> acted toward Me<br>Like a lion in the forest;<br>She raised her voice against Me—<br>Therefore I have rejected her.

They have sown wheat and reaped thorns,<br>They have endured pain to no avail.<br>Be shamed, then, by your harvest—<br>By the blazing wrath of the L<small>ORD</small>!<br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: As for My wicked neighbors who encroach on the heritage that I gave to My people Israel—I am going to uproot them from their soil, and I will uproot the House of Judah out of the midst of them.
Then, after I have uprooted them, I will take them back into favor, and restore them each to his own inheritance and his own land.
And if they learn the ways of My people, to swear by My name—“As the L<small>ORD</small> lives”—just as they once taught My people to swear by Baal, then they shall be <sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Or “incorporated into.”</i>built up in the midst of<sup class="endFootnote">-h</sup> My people.
But if they do not give heed, I will tear out that nation, tear it out and destroy it—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.

Chapter 13

Thus the L<small>ORD</small> said to me: “Go buy yourself a loincloth of linen, and put it around your loins, but do not dip it into water.”
So I bought the loincloth in accordance with the L<small>ORD</small>’s command, and put it about my loins.
And the word of the L<small>ORD</small> came to me a second time:
“Take the loincloth which you bought, which is about your loins, and go at once to Perath<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Or “the Euphrates”; cf. “Parah,” Josh. 18.23.</i> and cover it up there in a cleft of the rock.”
I went and buried it at Perath, as the L<small>ORD</small> had commanded me.
Then, after a long time, the L<small>ORD</small> said to me, “Go at once to Perath and take there the loincloth which I commanded you to bury there.”
So I went to Perath and dug up the loincloth from the place where I had buried it; and found the loincloth ruined; it was not good for anything.
The word of the L<small>ORD</small> came to me:
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: Even so will I ruin the overweening pride of Judah and Jerusalem.
This wicked people who refuse to heed My bidding, who follow the willfulness of their own hearts, who follow other gods and serve them and worship them, shall become like that loincloth, which is not good for anything.
For as the loincloth clings close to the loins of a man, so I brought close to Me the whole House of Israel and the whole House of Judah—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—that they might be My people, for fame, and praise, and splendor. But they would not obey.
And speak this word to them: Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of Israel: “Every jar should be filled with wine.” And when they say to you, “Don’t we know that every jar should be filled with wine?”
say to them, “Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: I am going to fill with drunkenness all the inhabitants of this land, and the kings who sit on the throne of David, and the priests and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
And I will smash them one against the other, parents and children alike—declares the L<small>ORD</small>; no pity, compassion, or mercy will stop Me from destroying them.”<br>
Attend and give ear; be not haughty,<br>For the L<small>ORD</small> has spoken.
Give honor to the L<small>ORD</small> your God<br>Before He brings darkness,<br>Before your feet stumble<br>On the mountains in shadow—<br>When you hope for light,<br>And it is turned to darkness<br>And becomes deep gloom.
For if you will not give heed,<br>My inmost self must weep,<br>Because of your arrogance;<br>My eye must stream and flow<br>With copious tears,<br>Because the flock of the L<small>ORD</small><br>Is taken captive.<br>
Say to the king and the queen mother,<br>“Sit in a lowly spot;<br>For your diadems are abased,<br>Your glorious crowns.”
The cities of the Negeb are shut,<br>There is no one to open them;<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., most of Judah has been annexed by an alien people.</i>Judah is exiled completely,<br>All of it exiled.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>

Can the Cushite change his skin,<br>Or the leopard his spots?<br>Just as much can you do good,<br>Who are practiced in doing evil!
So I will scatter you<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “them.”</i> like straw that flies<br>Before the desert wind.
This shall be your lot,<br>Your measured portion from Me<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>Because you forgot Me<br>And trusted in falsehood,
I in turn will lift your skirts over your face<br>And your shame shall be seen.
I behold your adulteries,<br>Your lustful neighing,<br>Your unbridled depravity, your vile acts<br>On the hills of the countryside.<br>Woe to you, O Jerusalem,<br>Who will not be clean!<br>How much longer shall it be?

Chapter 14

The word of the L<small>ORD</small> which came to Jeremiah concerning the droughts.<br>
Judah is in mourning,<br>Her settlements languish.<br>Men are bowed to the ground,<br>And the outcry of Jerusalem rises.
Their nobles sent their servants for water;<br>They came to the cisterns, they found no water.<br>They returned, their vessels empty.<br>They are shamed and humiliated,<br>They cover their heads.
<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Because of the ground there is dismay,<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br>For there has been no rain on the earth.<br>The plowmen are shamed,<br>They cover their heads.
Even the hind in the field<br>Forsakes her new-born fawn,<br>Because there is no grass.
And the wild asses stand on the bare heights,<br>Snuffing the air like jackals;<br>Their eyes pine,<br>Because there is no herbage.<br>
Though our iniquities testify against us,<br>Act, O L<small>ORD</small>, for the sake of Your name;<br>Though our rebellions are many<br>And we have sinned against You.
O Hope of Israel,<br>Its deliverer in time of trouble,<br>Why are You like a stranger in the land,<br>Like a traveler who stops only for the night?
Why are You like a man who is stunned,<br>Like a warrior who cannot give victory?<br>Yet You are in our midst, O L<small>ORD</small>,<br>And Your name is attached to us—<br>Do not forsake us!<br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> concerning this people: “Truly, they love to stray, they have not restrained their feet; so the L<small>ORD</small> has no pleasure in them. Now He will recall their iniquity and punish their sin.”
And the L<small>ORD</small> said to me, “Do not pray for the benefit of this people.
When they fast, I will not listen to their outcry; and when they present burnt offering and meal offering, I will not accept them. I will exterminate them by war, famine, and disease.”
I said, “Ah, Lord G<small>OD</small>! The prophets are saying to them, ‘You shall not see the sword, famine shall not come upon you, but I will give you unfailing security in this place.’”
The L<small>ORD</small> replied: It is a lie that the prophets utter in My name. I have not sent them or commanded them. I have not spoken to them. A lying vision, an empty divination, the deceit of their own contriving—that is what they prophesy to you!
Assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small> concerning the prophets who prophesy in My name though I have not sent them, and who say, “Sword and famine shall not befall this land”; those very prophets shall perish by sword and famine.
And the people to whom they prophesy shall be left lying in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword, with none to bury them—they, their wives, their sons, and their daughters. I will pour out upon them [the requital of] their wickedness.<br>
And do you speak to them thus:<br>Let my eyes run with tears,<br>Day and night let them not cease,<br>For <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “the maiden daughter, My people.”</i>my hapless people<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup> has suffered<br>A grievous injury, a very painful wound.

Have You, then, rejected Judah?<br>Have You spurned Zion?<br>Why have You smitten us<br>So that there is no cure?<br>Why do we hope for happiness,<br>But find no good;<br>For a time of healing,<br>And meet terror instead?
We acknowledge our wickedness, O L<small>ORD</small>—<br>The iniquity of our fathers—<br>For we have sinned against You.
For Your name’s sake, do not disown us;<br>Do not dishonor Your glorious throne.<br>Remember, do not annul Your covenant with us.
Can any of the false gods of the nations give rain?<br>Can the skies of themselves give showers?<br>Only You can, O L<small>ORD</small> our God!<br>So we hope in You,<br>For only You made all these things.

Chapter 15

The L<small>ORD</small> said to me, “Even if Moses and Samuel were to <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “stand before Me,” as Jeremiah is doing now; cf. 18.20.</i>intercede with Me,<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> I would not be won over to that people. Dismiss them from My presence, and let them go forth!
And if they ask you, ‘To what shall we go forth?’ answer them, ‘Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>Those destined for the plague, to the plague;<br>Those destined for the sword, to the sword;<br>Those destined for famine, to famine;<br>Those destined for captivity, to captivity.
And I will appoint over them four kinds<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> [of punishment]—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—the sword to slay, the dogs to drag, the birds of the sky, and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy.
I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, on account of King Manasseh son of Hezekiah of Judah, and of what he did in Jerusalem.’”<br>
But who will pity you, O Jerusalem,<br>Who will console you?<br>Who will turn aside to inquire<br>About your welfare?
You cast Me off<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>You go ever backward.<br>So I have stretched out My hand to destroy you;<br>I cannot relent.
I will scatter them as with a winnowing fork<br>Through the settlements of the earth.<br>I will bereave, I will destroy My people,<br>For they would not turn back from their ways.
Their widows shall be more numerous<br>Than the sands of the seas.<br>I will bring against them—<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Young men and mothers together<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>—<br>A destroyer at noonday.<br>I will bring down suddenly upon them<br>Alarm<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> and terror.
She who bore seven is forlorn,<br>Utterly disconsolate;<br>Her sun has set while it is still day,<br>She is shamed and humiliated.<br>The remnant of them I will deliver to the sword,<br>To the power of their enemies<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>
Woe is me, my mother, that you ever bore me—<br>A man of conflict and strife with all the land!<br>I have not lent,<br>And I have not borrowed;<br>Yet everyone curses me.<br>

When Your words were offered, I devoured them;<br>Your word brought me the delight and joy<br>Of knowing that Your name is attached to me,<br>O L<small>ORD</small>, God of Hosts.
I have not sat in the company of revelers<br>And made merry!<br>I have sat lonely because of Your hand upon me,<br>For You have filled me with gloom.
Why must my pain be endless,<br>My wound incurable,<br>Resistant to healing?<br>You have been to me like a spring that fails,<br>Like waters that cannot be relied on.<br>
Assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>If you turn back, I shall take you back<br>And you shall stand before Me;<br>If you produce what is noble<br>Out of the worthless,<br>You shall be My spokesman.<br>They shall come back to you,<br>Not you to them.
Against this people I will make you<br>As a fortified wall of bronze:<br>They will attack you,<br>But they shall not overcome you,<br>For I am with you to deliver and save you<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
I will save you from the hands of the wicked<br>And rescue you from the clutches of the violent.

Chapter 16

The word of the L<small>ORD</small> came to me:
You are not to marry and not to have sons and daughters in this place.
For thus said the L<small>ORD</small> concerning any sons and daughters that may be born in this place, and concerning the mothers who bear them, and concerning the fathers who beget them in this land:
They shall die gruesome deaths. They shall not be lamented or buried; they shall be like dung on the surface of the ground. They shall be consumed by the sword and by famine, and their corpses shall be food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth.<br>
For thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>Do not enter a house of mourning,<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “religious gathering.”</i><br>Do not go to lament and to condole with them;<br>For I have withdrawn My favor from that people<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>My kindness and compassion.
Great and small alike shall die in this land,<br>They shall not be buried; men shall not lament them,<br>Nor gash and tonsure themselves for them.
They shall not break bread<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">So a few mss. Most mss. and editions read “to them.”</i> for a mourner<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “mourning.”</i><br>To comfort him for a bereavement,<br>Nor offer one a cup of consolation<br>For the loss of his father or mother.
Nor shall you enter a house of feasting,<br>To sit down with them to eat and drink.<br>
For thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: I am going to banish from this place, in your days and before your eyes, the sound of mirth and gladness, the voice of bridegroom and bride.
And when you announce all these things to that people, and they ask you, “Why has the L<small>ORD</small> decreed upon us all this fearful evil? What is the iniquity and what the sin that we have committed against the L<small>ORD</small> our God?”
say to them, “Because your fathers deserted Me—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—and followed other gods and served them and worshiped them; they deserted Me and did not keep My Instruction.
And you have acted worse than your fathers, every one of you following the willfulness of his evil heart and paying no heed to Me.
Therefore I will hurl you out of this land to a land that neither you nor your fathers have known, and there you will serve other gods, day and night; for I will show you no mercy.”<br>
Assuredly, a time is coming—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—when it shall no more be said, “As the L<small>ORD</small> lives who brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt,”
but rather, “As the L<small>ORD</small> lives who brought the Israelites out of the northland, and out of all the lands to which He had banished them.” For I will bring them back to their land, which I gave to their fathers.<br>
Lo, I am sending for many fishermen<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>And they shall haul them out;<br>And after that I will send for many hunters,<br>And they shall hunt them<br>Out of every mountain and out of every hill<br>And out of the clefts of the rocks.
For My eyes are on all their ways,<br>They are not hidden from My presence,<br>Their iniquity is not concealed from My sight.
I will pay them in full<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">See note to Isa. 65.7.</i>—<br>Nay, doubly for their iniquity and their sins—<br>Because they have defiled My land<br>With the corpses of their abominations,<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., their lifeless idols.</i><br>And have filled My own possession<br>With their abhorrent things.
O L<small>ORD</small>, my strength and my stronghold,<br>My refuge in a day of trouble,<br>To You nations shall come<br>From the ends of the earth and say:<br>Our fathers inherited utter delusions,<br>Things that are futile and worthless.
Can a man make gods for himself?<br>No-gods are they!
Assuredly, I will teach them,<br>Once and for all I will teach them<br>My power and My might.<br>And they shall learn that My name is L<small>ORD</small>.

Heal me, O L<small>ORD</small>, and let me be healed;<br>Save me, and let me be saved;<br>For You are my glory.
See, they say to me:<br>“Where is the prediction of the L<small>ORD</small>?<br>Let it come to pass!”
But I have not <sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Exact force of Heb. uncertain. Emendation yields “urged you to [bring] misfortune.”</i>evaded<br>Being a shepherd in your service,<sup class="endFootnote">-g</sup><br>Nor have I longed for the fatal day.<br>You know the utterances of my lips,<br>They were ever before You.

Let my persecutors be shamed,<br>And let not me be shamed;<br>Let them be dismayed,<br>And let not me be dismayed.<br>Bring on them the day of disaster,<br>And shatter them with double destruction.<br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> to me: Go and stand in the People’s Gate, by which the kings of Judah enter and by which they go forth, and in all the gates of Jerusalem,
and say to them: Hear the word of the L<small>ORD</small>, O kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem who enter by these gates!
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: Guard yourselves for your own sake against carrying burdens<sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Or “merchandise.”</i> on the sabbath day, and bringing them through the gates of Jerusalem.
Nor shall you carry out burdens from your houses on the sabbath day, or do any work, but you shall hallow the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers. 
(But they would not listen or turn their ear; they stiffened their necks and would not pay heed or accept discipline.)
If you obey Me—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—and do not bring in burdens through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day and do no work on it,
then through the gates of this city shall enter kings who sit upon the throne of David, with their officers—riding on chariots and horses, they and their officers—and the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And this city shall be inhabited for all time.
And people shall come from the towns of Judah and from the environs of Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the Shephelah, and from the hill country, and from the Negeb, bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices, meal offerings and frankincense, and bringing offerings of thanksgiving to the House of the L<small>ORD</small>.
But if you do not obey My command to hallow the sabbath day and to carry in no burdens through the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day, then I will set fire to its gates; it shall consume the fortresses of Jerusalem and it shall not be extinguished.

Chapter 18

The word which came to Jeremiah from the L<small>ORD</small>:
“Go down to the house of a potter, and there I will impart My words to you.”
So I went down to the house of a potter, and found him working at the wheel.
<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">So some mss. and one early edition. Most mss. and editions read “And if the vessel that he was making with clay in the potter’s hands was spoiled.”</i>And if the vessel he was making was spoiled, as happens to clay in the potter’s hands,<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> he would make it into another vessel, such as the potter saw fit to make.
Then the word of the L<small>ORD</small> came to me:
O House of Israel, can I not deal with you like this potter?—says the L<small>ORD</small>. Just like clay in the hands of the potter, so are you in My hands, O House of Israel!
At one moment I may decree that a nation or a kingdom shall be uprooted and pulled down and destroyed;
but if that nation against which I made the decree turns back from its wickedness, I change My mind concerning the punishment I planned to bring on it.
At another moment I may decree that a nation or a kingdom shall be built and planted;
but if it does what is displeasing to Me and does not obey Me, then I change My mind concerning the good I planned to bestow upon it.
And now, say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: I am devising<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">The same Hebrew word as is used above for “potter.”</i> disaster for you and laying plans against you. Turn back, each of you, from your wicked ways, and mend your ways and your actions!
But they will say, “It is no use. We will keep on following our own plans; each of us will act in the willfulness of his evil heart.”<br>
Assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>Inquire among the nations:<br>Who has heard anything like this?<br>Maiden Israel has done<br>A most horrible thing.
<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of verse uncertain; cf. 2.13, 17.13.</i>Does one forsake Lebanon snow<br>From the mountainous rocks?<br>Does one abandon cool water<br>Flowing from afar?
Yet My people have forgotten Me:<br>They sacrifice to a delusion:<br>They are made to stumble in their ways—<br>The ancient paths—<br>And to walk instead on byways,<br>On a road not built up.
So their land will become a desolation,<br>An object of hissing<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">These actions were performed at the sight of ruin to ward off a like fate from the observer; cf.

Listen to me, O L<small>ORD</small>—<br>And take note of <sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “my case.”</i>what my enemies say!<sup class="endFootnote">-g</sup>
Should good be repaid with evil?<br>Yet they have dug a pit for me.<br>Remember how I stood before You<br>To plead in their behalf,<br>To turn Your anger away from them!
Oh, give their children over to famine,<br>Mow them down by the sword.<br>Let their wives be bereaved<br>Of children and husbands,<br>Let their men be struck down by the plague,<br>And their young men be slain in battle by the sword.
Let an outcry be heard from their houses<br>When You bring sudden marauders against them;<br>For they have dug a pit to trap me,<br>And laid snares for my feet.

Chapter 19

Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: Go buy a jug of potter’s ware. And [take] some of the elders of the people and the priests,
and go out to the Valley of Ben-hinnom—<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Others “by way of the Potsherd Gate”; meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>at the entrance of the Harsith Gate<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>—and proclaim there the words which I will speak to you.
Say: “Hear the word of the L<small>ORD</small>, O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem! Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: I am going to bring such disaster upon this place that the ears of all who hear about it will tingle.
For they and their fathers and the kings of Judah have forsaken Me, and have made this place alien [to Me]; they have sacrificed in it to other gods whom they have not experienced,<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">See note at Deut. 11.28.</i> and they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent.
They have built shrines to Baal, to put their children to the fire as burnt offerings to Baal—which I never commanded, never decreed, and which never came to My mind.
Assuredly, a time is coming—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—when this place shall no longer be called Topheth or Valley of Ben-hinnom, but Valley of Slaughter.
“And I will frustrate<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “empty,” Heb. u-baqqothi, a play on baqbuq, “jug” in v. 1.</i> the plans of Judah and Jerusalem in this place. I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, by the hand of those who seek their lives; and I will give their carcasses as food to the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth.
And I will make this city an object of horror and hissing;<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">See note at 18.16.</i> everyone who passes by it will be appalled and will hiss over all its wounds.
And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall devour one another’s flesh—because of the desperate straits to which they will be reduced by their enemies, who seek their life.”
Then you shall smash the jug in the sight of the men who go with you,
and say to them: “Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts: So will I smash this people and this city, as one smashes a potter’s vessel, which can never be mended. And they shall bury in Topheth until no room is left for burying.
That is what I will do to this place and its inhabitants—declares the L<small>ORD</small>. I will make this city like Topheth:
the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah shall be unclean, like that place Topheth—all the houses on the roofs of which offerings were made to the whole host of heaven and libations were poured out to other gods.”<br>
When Jeremiah returned from Topheth, where the L<small>ORD</small> had sent him to prophesy, he stood in the court of the House of the L<small>ORD</small> and said to all the people:
“Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: I am going to bring upon this city and upon all its villages all the disaster which I have decreed against it, for they have stiffened their necks and refused to heed My words.”

Chapter 20

Pashhur son of Immer, the priest who was chief officer of the House of the L<small>ORD</small>, heard Jeremiah prophesy these things.
Pashhur thereupon had Jeremiah flogged and put in the cell<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> at the Upper Benjamin Gate in the House of the L<small>ORD</small>.
The next day, Pashhur released Jeremiah from the cell.<br>But Jeremiah said to him, “The L<small>ORD</small> has named you not Pashhur, but Magor-missabib.<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., “Terror all around”; cf. v. 10.</i>
For thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: I am going to deliver you and all your friends over to terror: they will fall by the sword of their enemies while you look on. I will deliver all Judah into the hands of the king of Babylon; he will exile them to Babylon or put them to the sword.
And I will deliver all the wealth, all the riches, and all the prized possessions of this city, and I will also deliver all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hands of their enemies: they shall seize them as plunder and carry them off to Babylon.
As for you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house, you shall go into captivity. You shall come to Babylon; there you shall die and there you shall be buried, and so shall all your friends to whom you prophesied falsely.”<br>
You enticed me, O L<small>ORD</small>, and I was enticed;<br>You overpowered me and You prevailed.<br>I have become a constant laughingstock,<br>Everyone jeers at me.
For every time I speak, I must cry out,<br>Must shout, “Lawlessness and rapine!”<br>For the word of the L<small>ORD</small> causes me<br>Constant disgrace and contempt.
I thought, “I will not mention Him,<br>No more will I speak in His name”—<br>But [His word] was like a raging fire in my heart,<br>Shut up in my bones;<br>I could not hold it in, I was helpless.
I heard the whispers of the crowd—<br>Terror all around:<br>“Inform! Let us inform against him!”<br>All my [supposed] friends<br>Are waiting for me to stumble:<br>“Perhaps he can be entrapped,<br>And we can prevail against him<br>And take our vengeance on him.”
But the L<small>ORD</small> is with me like a mighty warrior;<br>Therefore my persecutors shall stumble;<br>They shall not prevail and shall not succeed.<br>They shall be utterly shamed<br>With a humiliation for all time,<br>Which shall not be forgotten.
O L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, You who test the righteous,<br>Who examine the heart and the mind,<br>Let me see Your retribution upon them,<br>For I lay my case before You.
Sing unto the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>Praise the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>For He has rescued the needy<br>From the hands of evildoers!<br>
Accursed be the day<br>That I was born!<br>Let not the day be blessed<br>When my mother bore me!
Accursed be the man<br>Who brought my father the news<br>And said, “A boy<br>Is born to you,”<br>And gave him such joy!
Let that man<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “day.”</i> become like the cities<br>Which the L<small>ORD</small> overthrew without relenting!<br>Let him hear shrieks in the morning<br>And battle shouts at noontide—
Because he did not kill me before birth<br>So that my mother might be my grave,<br>And her womb big [with me] for all time.
Why did I ever issue from the womb,<br>To see misery and woe,<br>To spend all my days in shame!

Chapter 21

The word which came to Jeremiah from the L<small>ORD</small>, when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur son of Malchiah and the priest Zephaniah, son of Maaseiah, to say,
“Please inquire of the L<small>ORD</small> on our behalf, for King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon is attacking us. Perhaps the L<small>ORD</small> will act for our sake in accordance with all His wonders, so that [Nebuchadrezzar] will withdraw from us.”
Jeremiah answered them, “Thus shall you say to Zedekiah:
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of Israel: I am going to turn around the weapons in your hands with which you are battling outside the wall against those who are besieging you—the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans—and I will take them into the midst of this city;
and I Myself will battle against you with an outstretched mighty arm, with anger and rage and great wrath.
I will strike the inhabitants of this city, man and beast: they shall die by a terrible pestilence.
And then—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—I will deliver King Zedekiah of Judah and his courtiers and the people—those in this city who survive the pestilence, the sword, and the famine—into the hands of King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, into the hands of their enemies, into the hands of those who seek their lives. He will put them to the sword without pity, without compassion, without mercy.
“And to this people you shall say: Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: I set before you the way of life and the way of death.
Whoever remains in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence; but whoever leaves and goes over to the Chaldeans who are besieging you shall live; <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “he shall have his life as booty.”</i>he shall at least gain his life.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>
For I have set My face against this city for evil and not for good—declares the L<small>ORD</small>. It shall be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon, who will destroy it by fire.”<br>
To the House of the king of Judah: Hear the word of the L<small>ORD</small>!
O House of David, thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>Render just verdicts<br>Morning by morning;<br>Rescue him who is robbed<br>From him who defrauded him.<br>Else My wrath will break forth like fire<br>And burn, with none to quench it,<br>Because of your wicked acts.
I will deal with you, <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Force of Heb. uncertain.</i>O inhabitants of the valley,<br>O rock of the plain<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>You who say, “Who can come down against us?<br>Who can get into our lairs?”
I will punish you according to your deeds<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>I will set fire to its forest;<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Perhaps a reference to the royal palace; cf. 1 Kings 7.2.</i><br>It shall consume all that is around it.

Chapter 22

Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: Go down to the palace of the king of Judah, where you shall utter this word.
Say: “Hear the word of the L<small>ORD</small>: O king of Judah, you who sit on the throne of David, and your courtiers and your subjects who enter these gates!
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: Do what is just and right; rescue from the defrauder him who is robbed; do not wrong the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow; commit no lawless act, and do not shed the blood of the innocent in this place.
For if you fulfill this command, then through the gates of this palace shall enter kings of David’s line who sit upon his throne, riding horse-drawn chariots, with their courtiers and their subjects.
But if you do not heed these commands, I swear by Myself—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—that this palace shall become a ruin.”
For thus said the L<small>ORD</small> concerning the royal palace of Judah:<br>You are as Gilead to Me,<br>As the summit of Lebanon;<br>But I will make you a desert,<br>Uninhabited towns.
I will appoint destroyers against you,<br>Each with his tools;<br>They shall cut down your choicest cedars<br>And make them fall into the fire.
And when many nations pass by this city and one man asks another, “Why did the L<small>ORD</small> do thus to that great city?”
the reply will be, “Because they forsook the covenant with the L<small>ORD</small> their God and bowed down to other gods and served them.”<br>
Do not weep for the dead<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., Josiah; see 2 Kings 23.29–30.</i><br>And do not lament for him;<br>Weep rather for <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the king called by his throne name Jehoahaz in 2 Kings 23.31 ff., and by his private name Shallum here in v. 11 and in 1 Chron. 3.15.</i>him who is leaving,<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>For he shall never come back<br>To see the land of his birth!<br>
For thus said the L<small>ORD</small> concerning Shallum<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the king called by his throne name Jehoahaz in 2 Kings 23.31 ff., and by his private name Shallum here in v. 11 and in 1 Chron. 3.15.</i> son of King Josiah of Judah, who succeeded his father Josiah as king, but who has gone forth from this place: He shall never come back.
He shall die in the place to which he was exiled, and he shall not see this land again.<br>
Ha! he who builds his house with unfairness<br>And his upper chambers with injustice,<br>Who makes his fellow man work without pay<br>And does not give him his wages,
Who thinks: I will build me a vast palace<br>With spacious upper chambers,<br>Provided with windows,<br>Paneled in cedar,<br>Painted with vermilion!
Do you think you are more a king<br>Because you compete in cedar?<br>Your father <sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he was content with the simple necessities of life.</i>ate and drank<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup><br>And dispensed justice and equity—<br>Then all went well with him.

But your eyes and your mind are only<br>On ill-gotten gains,<br>On shedding the blood of the innocent,<br>On committing fraud and violence.
Assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small> concerning Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah:<br><sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">They shall express neither sorrow at the loss of a relative nor grief at the death of a ruler.</i>They shall not mourn for him,<br>“Ah, brother!

I will deliver you into the hands of those who seek your life, into the hands of those you dread, into the hands of King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon and into the hands of the Chaldeans.
I will hurl you and the mother who bore you into another land, where you were not born; there you shall both die.
They shall not return to the land that they yearn to come back to.
Is this man Coniah<br>A wretched broken pot,<br>A vessel no one wants?<br>Why are he and his offspring hurled out,<br>And cast away in a land they knew not?
O land, land, land,<br>Hear the word of the L<small>ORD</small>!
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>Record this man as without succession,<br>One who shall never be found acceptable;<br>For no man of his offspring shall be accepted<br>To sit on the throne of David<br>And to rule again in Judah.

Chapter 23

Ah, shepherds who let the flock of My pasture stray and scatter!—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
Assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who should tend My people: It is you who let My flock scatter and go astray. You gave no thought to them, but I am going to give thought to you, for your wicked acts—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
And I Myself will gather the remnant of My flock from all the lands to which I have banished them, and I will bring them back to their pasture, where they shall be fertile and increase.
And I will appoint over them shepherds who will tend them; they shall no longer fear or be dismayed, and none of them shall be missing—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
See, a time is coming—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—when I will raise up a true branch of David’s line. He shall reign as king and shall prosper, and he shall do what is just and right in the land.
In his days Judah shall be delivered and Israel shall dwell secure. And this is the name by which he shall be called: “The L<small>ORD</small> is our Vindicator.”
Assuredly, a time is coming—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—when it shall no more be said, “As the L<small>ORD</small> lives, who brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt,”
but rather, “As the L<small>ORD</small> lives, who brought out and led the offspring of the House of Israel from the northland and from all the lands to which I have banished them.” And they shall dwell upon their own soil.<br>
Concerning the prophets.<br><br>My heart is crushed within me,<br>All my bones are trembling;<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i><br>I have become like a drunken man,<br>Like one overcome by wine—<br>Because of the L<small>ORD</small> and His holy word.

For both prophet and priest are godless;<br>Even in My House I find their wickedness<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
Assuredly,<br>Their path shall become<br>Like slippery ground;<br>They shall be thrust into darkness<br>And there they shall fall;<br>For I will bring disaster upon them,<br>The year of their doom<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
In the prophets of Samaria<br>I saw a repulsive thing:<br>They prophesied by Baal<br>And led My people Israel astray.
But what I see in the prophets of Jerusalem<br>Is something horrifying:<br>Adultery and false dealing.<br>They encourage evildoers,<br>So that no one turns back from his wickedness.<br>To Me they are all like Sodom,<br>And [all] its inhabitants like Gomorrah.<br>
Assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts concerning the prophets:<br><br>I am going to make them eat wormwood<br>And drink a bitter draft;<br>For from the prophets of Jerusalem<br>Godlessness has gone forth to the whole land.<br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts:<br>Do not listen to the words of the prophets<br>Who prophesy to you.<br>They are deluding you,<br>The prophecies they speak are from their own minds,<br>Not from the mouth of the L<small>ORD</small>.
They declare to men who despise Me:<br>The L<small>ORD</small> has said:<br>“All shall be well with you”;<br>And to all who follow their willful hearts they say:<br>“No evil shall befall you.”
But he who has stood in the council of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>And seen, and heard His word—<br>He who has listened to His word must obey.<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Change of vocalization yields “announce it”; cf. vv. 22, 28.</i>

Am I only a God near at hand<br>—says the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>And not a God far away?
If a man enters a hiding place,<br>Do I not see him?<br>—says the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>For I fill both heaven and earth<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>
I have heard what the prophets say, who prophesy falsely in My name: “I had a dream, I had a dream.”
<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>How long will there be<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> in the minds of the prophets who prophesy falsehood—the prophets of their own deceitful minds—
the plan to make My people forget My name, by means of the dreams which they tell each other, just as their fathers forgot My name because of Baal?
Let the prophet who has a dream tell the dream; and let him who has received My word report My word faithfully! How can straw be compared to grain?—says the L<small>ORD</small>.
Behold, My word is like fire—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—and like a hammer that shatters rock!
Assuredly, I am going to deal with the prophets—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—who steal My words from one another.
I am going to deal with the prophets—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—who wag<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> their tongues and make oracular utterances.
I am going to deal with those who prophesy lying dreams—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—who relate them to lead My people astray with their reckless lies, when I did not send them or command them. They do this people no good—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
And when this people—or a prophet or a priest—asks you, “What is the burden<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., pronouncement; cf. Isa. 13.1, 15.1, etc., where the word rendered “pronouncement” can also mean “burden.”</i> of the L<small>ORD</small>?” you shall answer them, <sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Septuagint and other versions read “You are the burden!”</i>“What is the burden?<sup class="endFootnote">-g</sup> I will cast you off”—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
As for the prophet or priest or layman who shall say “the burden of the L<small>ORD</small>,” I will punish that person and his house.
Thus you shall speak to each other, every one to his fellow, “What has the L<small>ORD</small> answered?” or “What has the L<small>ORD</small> spoken?”
But do not mention “the burden of the L<small>ORD</small>” any more. <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Does a man regard his own word as a “burden,”<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> that you pervert the words of the living God, the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, our God?
Thus you shall speak to the prophet: “What did the L<small>ORD</small> answer you?” or “What did the L<small>ORD</small> speak?”
But if you say “the burden of the L<small>ORD</small>”—assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: Because you said this thing, “the burden of the L<small>ORD</small>,” whereas I sent word to you not to say “the burden of the L<small>ORD</small>,”
I will utterly <sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Some Heb. mss., Septuagint, and other versions read “lift you up,” a word from the same root as “burden.”</i>forget you<sup class="endFootnote">-h</sup> and I will cast you away from My presence, together with the city that I gave to you and your fathers.
And I will lay upon you a disgrace for all time, shame for all time, which shall never be forgotten.

Chapter 24

The L<small>ORD</small> showed me two baskets of figs, placed in front of the Temple of the L<small>ORD</small>. This was after King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon had exiled King Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim of Judah, and the officials of Judah, and the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.
One basket contained very good figs, like first-ripened figs, and the other basket contained very bad figs, so bad that they could not be eaten.
And the L<small>ORD</small> said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” I answered, “Figs—the good ones are very good, and the bad ones very bad, so bad that they cannot be eaten.”
Then the word of the L<small>ORD</small> came to me:
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of Israel: As with these good figs, so will I single out for good the Judean exiles whom I have driven out from this place to the land of the Chaldeans.
I will look upon them favorably, and I will bring them back to this land; I will build them and not overthrow them; I will plant them and not uproot them.
And I will give them the understanding to acknowledge Me, for I am the L<small>ORD</small>. And they shall be My people and I will be their God, when they turn back to Me with all their heart.
And like the bad figs, which are so bad that they cannot be eaten—thus said the Lord—so will I treat King Zedekiah of Judah and his officials and the remnant of Jerusalem that is left in this land, and those who are living in the land of Egypt:
I will make them a horror—an evil—to all the kingdoms of the earth, a disgrace and a proverb, a byword and a curse<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a standard by which men curse; cf. Gen. 12.2 and note; Zech. 8.13.</i> in all the places to which I banish them.
I will send the sword, famine, and pestilence against them until they are exterminated from the land that I gave to them and their fathers.

Chapter 25

The word which came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah, which was the first year of King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon.
This is what the prophet Jeremiah said to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem:<br>
From the thirteenth year of King Josiah son of Amon of Judah, to this day—these twenty-three years—the word of the L<small>ORD</small> has come to me. I have spoken to you persistently, but you would not listen.
Moreover, the L<small>ORD</small> constantly sent all his servants the prophets to you, but you would not listen or incline your ears to hear
when they said, “Turn back, every one, from your evil ways and your wicked acts, that you may remain throughout the ages on the soil which the L<small>ORD</small> gave to you and your fathers.
Do not follow other gods, to serve them and worship them. Do not vex Me with what your own hands have made,<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., idols.</i> and I will not bring disaster upon you.”
But you would not listen to Me—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—but vexed Me with what your hands made, to your own hurt.
Assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts: Because you would not listen to My words,
I am going to send for all the peoples of the north—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—and for My servant, King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, and bring them against this land and its inhabitants, and against all those nations round about. I will exterminate them and make them a desolation, an object of hissing<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. note at 18.16.</i>—ruins for all time.
And I will banish from them the sound of mirth and gladness, the voice of bridegroom and bride, and the sound of the mill and the light of the lamp.
This whole land shall be a desolate ruin.<br>And those nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
When the seventy years are over, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation and the land of the Chaldeans for their sins—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—and I will make it a desolation for all time.
And I will bring upon that land all that I have decreed against it, all that is recorded in this book—that which Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations.
For they too shall be enslaved by many nations and great kings; and I will requite them according to their acts and according to their conduct.
For thus said the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of Israel, to me: “Take from My hand this cup of wine—of wrath—and make all the nations to whom I send you drink of it.
Let them drink and retch and act crazy, because of the sword that I am sending among them.”
So I took the cup from the hand of the L<small>ORD</small> and gave drink to all the nations to whom the L<small>ORD</small> had sent me:
Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, and its kings and officials, to make them a desolate ruin, an object of hissing and a curse<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. note at 24.9.</i>—as is now the case;
Pharaoh king of Egypt, his courtiers, his officials, and all his people;
all <sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>the mixed peoples;<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup> all the kings of the land of Uz; all the kings of the land of the Philistines—Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and what is left of Ashdod;
Edom, Moab, and Ammon;
all the kings of Tyre and all the kings of Sidon, and all the kings of the coastland across the sea;
Dedan, Tema, and Buz, and all those who have their hair clipped;
all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of <sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>the mixed peoples<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup> who live in the desert;
all the kings of Zimri<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> and all the kings of Elam and all the kings of Media;
all the kings of the north, whether far from or close to each other—all the <sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>royal lands which are on the earth.<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup> And last of all, the king of Sheshach<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">A cipher for Babel, Babylon.</i> shall drink.
Say to them: “Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: Drink and get drunk and vomit; fall and never rise again, because of the sword that I send among you.”
And if they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink, say to them, “Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts: You must drink!
If I am bringing the punishment first on the city that bears My name, do you expect to go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for I am summoning the sword against all the inhabitants of the earth—declares the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts.”
You are to prophesy all those things to them, and then say to them:<br><br>The L<small>ORD</small> roars from on high,<br>He makes His voice heard from His holy dwelling;<br>He roars aloud over His [earthly] abode;<br>He utters shouts like the grape-treaders,<br>Against all the dwellers on earth.
Tumult has reached the ends of the earth,<br>For the L<small>ORD</small> has a case against the nations,<br>He contends with all flesh.<br>He delivers the wicked to the sword<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts:<br>Disaster goes forth<br>From nation to nation;<br>A great storm is unleashed<br>From the remotest parts of earth.<br>
In that day, the earth shall be strewn with the slain of the L<small>ORD</small> from one end to the other. They shall not be mourned, or gathered and buried; they shall become dung upon the face of the earth.<br>
Howl, you shepherds, and yell,<br>Strew [dust] on yourselves, you lords of the flock!<br>For the day of your slaughter draws near.<br><sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>I will break you in pieces,<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup><br>And you shall fall like a precious vessel.
Flight shall fail the shepherds,<br>And escape, the lords of the flock.
Hark, the outcry of the shepherds,<br>And the howls of the lords of the flock!<br>For the L<small>ORD</small> is ravaging their pasture.
The peaceful meadows shall be wiped out<br>By the fierce wrath of the L<small>ORD</small>.
Like a lion, He has gone forth from His lair;<br>The land has become a desolation,<br>Because of the oppressive<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> wrath,<br>Because of His fierce anger.

Chapter 26

At the beginning of the reign of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah, this word came from the L<small>ORD</small>:
“Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: Stand in the court of the House of the L<small>ORD</small>, and speak to [the men of] all the towns of Judah, who are coming to worship in the House of the L<small>ORD</small>, all the words which I command you to speak to them. Do not omit anything.
Perhaps they will listen and turn back, each from his evil way, that I may renounce the punishment I am planning to bring upon them for their wicked acts.
“Say to them: Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: If you do not obey Me, abiding by the Teaching that I have set before you,
heeding the words of My servants the prophets whom I have been sending to you persistently—but you have not heeded—
then I will make this House like Shiloh, and I will make this city a curse<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. note at 24.9.</i> for all the nations of earth.”
The priests and prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the House of the L<small>ORD</small>.
And when Jeremiah finished speaking all that the L<small>ORD</small> had commanded him to speak to all the people, the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him, shouting, “You shall die!
How dare you prophesy in the name of the L<small>ORD</small> that this House shall become like Shiloh and this city be made desolate, without inhabitants?” And all the people crowded about Jeremiah in the House of the L<small>ORD</small>.
When the officials of Judah heard about this, they went up from the king’s palace to the House of the L<small>ORD</small> and held a session at the entrance of the New Gate of <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">So many mss. and ancient versions; other mss. and the editions omit these words.</i>the House of<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup> the L<small>ORD</small>.
The priests and prophets said to the officials and to all the people, “This man deserves the death penalty, for he has prophesied against this city, as you yourselves have heard.”
Jeremiah said to the officials and to all the people, “It was the L<small>ORD</small> who sent me to prophesy against this House and this city all the words you heard.
Therefore mend your ways and your acts, and heed the L<small>ORD</small> your God, that the L<small>ORD</small> may renounce the punishment He has decreed for you.
As for me, I am in your hands: do to me what seems good and right to you.
But know that if you put me to death, you and this city and its inhabitants will be guilty of shedding the blood of an innocent man. For in truth the L<small>ORD</small> has sent me to you, to speak all these words to you.”
Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and prophets, “This man does not deserve the death penalty, for he spoke to us in the name of the L<small>ORD</small> our God.”
And some of the elders of the land arose and said to the entire assemblage of the people,
“Micah the Morashtite, who prophesied in the days of King Hezekiah of Judah, said to all the people of Judah: ‘Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts:<br>Zion shall be plowed as a field,<br>Jerusalem shall become heaps of ruins<br>And the Temple Mount a shrine in the woods.’<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Mic. 3.12.</i>
“Did King Hezekiah of Judah, and all Judah, put him to death? Did he not rather fear the L<small>ORD</small> and implore the L<small>ORD</small>, so that the L<small>ORD</small> renounced the punishment He had decreed against them? We are about to do great injury to ourselves!”<br>
There was also a man prophesying in the name of the L<small>ORD</small>, Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim, who prophesied against this city and this land the same things as Jeremiah.
King Jehoiakim and all his warriors and all the officials heard about his address, and the king wanted to put him to death. Uriah heard of this and fled in fear, and came to Egypt.
But King Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt, Elnathan son of Achbor and men with him to Egypt.
They took Uriah out of Egypt and brought him to King Jehoiakim, who had him put to the sword and his body thrown into the burial place of the common people.
However, Ahikam son of Shaphan protected Jeremiah, so that he was not handed over to the people for execution.

Chapter 27

At the beginning of the reign of King Jehoiakim<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “Zedekiah”; so a few mss. and Syriac; cf. vv. 3 and 12.</i> son of Josiah of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> to me: Make for yourself thongs and bars of a yoke, and put them on your neck.
<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “And send,” i.e., a message.</i>And send them<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup> to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the Ammonites, the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon, by envoys who have come to King Zedekiah of Judah in Jerusalem;
and give them this charge to their masters: Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: Say this to your masters:
“It is I who made the earth, and the men and beasts who are on the earth, by My great might and My outstretched arm; and I give it to whomever I deem proper.
I herewith deliver all these lands to My servant, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon; I even give him the wild beasts to serve him.
All nations shall serve him, his son and his grandson—until the turn of his own land comes, when many nations and great kings shall subjugate him.
The nation or kingdom that does not serve him—King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon—and does not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation I will visit—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—with sword, famine, and pestilence, until I have destroyed it by his hands.
As for you, give no heed to your prophets, augurs, dreamers,<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “dreams.”</i> diviners, and sorcerers, who say to you, ‘Do not serve the king of Babylon.’
For they prophesy falsely to you—with the result that you shall be banished from your land; I will drive you out and you shall perish.
But the nation that puts its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serves him, will be left by Me on its own soil—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—to till it and dwell on it.”<br>
I also spoke to King Zedekiah of Judah in just the same way: “Put your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon; serve him and his people, and live!
Otherwise you will die together with your people, by sword, famine, and pestilence, as the L<small>ORD</small> has decreed against any nation that does not serve the king of Babylon.
Give no heed to the words of the prophets who say to you, ‘Do not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they prophesy falsely to you.
I have not sent them—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—and they prophesy falsely in My name, with the result that I will drive you out and you shall perish, together with the prophets who prophesy to you.”
And to the priests and to all that people I said: “Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: Give no heed to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you, ‘The vessels of the House of the L<small>ORD</small> shall shortly be brought back from Babylon,’ for they prophesy falsely to you.
Give them no heed. Serve the king of Babylon, and live! Otherwise this city shall become a ruin.
If they are really prophets and the word of the L<small>ORD</small> is with them, let them intercede with the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts not to let the vessels remaining in the House of the L<small>ORD</small>, in the royal palace of Judah, and in Jerusalem, go to Babylon!
“For thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts concerning the columns, the tank,<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “sea”; cf. 1 Kings 7.23 ff.</i> the stands, and the rest of the vessels remaining in this city,
which King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon did not take when he exiled King Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;
for thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels remaining in the House of the L<small>ORD</small>, in the royal palace of Judah, and in Jerusalem:
They shall be brought to Babylon, and there they shall remain, until I take note of them—declares the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts—and bring them up and restore them to this place.”

Chapter 28

That year, early in the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah, in the fifth month of the fourth year, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, who was from Gibeon, spoke to me in the House of the L<small>ORD</small>, in the presence of the priests and all the people. He said:
“Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: I hereby break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
In two years, I will restore to this place all the vessels of the House of the L<small>ORD</small> which King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon took from this place and brought to Babylon.
And I will bring back to this place King Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim of Judah, and all the Judean exiles who went to Babylon—declares the L<small>ORD</small>. Yes, I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.”
Then the prophet Jeremiah answered the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and of all the people who were standing in the House of the L<small>ORD</small>.
The prophet Jeremiah said: “Amen! May the L<small>ORD</small> do so! May the L<small>ORD</small> fulfill what you have prophesied and bring back from Babylon to this place the vessels of the House of the L<small>ORD</small> and all the exiles!
But just listen to this word which I address to you and to all the people:
The prophets who lived before you and me from ancient times prophesied war, disaster, and pestilence against many lands and great kingdoms.
So if a prophet prophesies good fortune, then only when the word of the prophet comes true can it be known that the L<small>ORD</small> really sent him.”
But the prophet Hananiah removed the bar from the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, and broke it;
and Hananiah said in the presence of all the people, “Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: So will I break the yoke of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon from off the necks of all the nations, in two years.” And the prophet Jeremiah went on his way.
After the prophet Hananiah had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, the word of the L<small>ORD</small> came to Jeremiah:
“Go say to Hananiah: Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: You broke bars of wood, but <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Septuagint reads “I will.”</i>you shall<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> make bars of iron instead.
For thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: I have put an iron yoke upon the necks of all those nations, that they may serve King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon—and serve him they shall! I have even given the wild beasts to him.”
And the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah, “Listen, Hananiah! The L<small>ORD</small> did not send you, and you have given this people lying assurances.
Assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: I am going to banish you from off the earth. This year you shall die, for you have urged disloyalty to the L<small>ORD</small>.”
And the prophet Hananiah died that year, in the seventh month.

Chapter 29

This is the text of the letter which the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to the priests, the prophets, the rest of the elders of the exile community, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon—
after King Jeconiah, the queen mother, the eunuchs, the officials of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen and smiths had left Jerusalem.
[The letter was sent] through Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom King Zedekiah of Judah had dispatched to Babylon, to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.<br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel, to the whole community which I exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon:
Build houses and live in them, plant gardens and eat their fruit.
Take wives and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters. Multiply there, do not decrease.
And seek the welfare of the city to which I have exiled you and pray to the L<small>ORD</small> in its behalf; for in its prosperity you shall prosper.
For thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: Let not the prophets and diviners in your midst deceive you, and pay no heed to the dreams they<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “you.”</i> dream.
For they prophesy to you in My name falsely; I did not send them—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
For thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: When Babylon’s seventy years are over, I will take note of you, and I will fulfill to you My promise of favor—to bring you back to this place.
For I am mindful of the plans I have made concerning you—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—plans for your welfare, not for disaster, to give you a hopeful future.
When you call Me, and come and pray to Me, I will give heed to you.
You will search for Me and find Me, if only you seek Me wholeheartedly.
I will be at hand for you—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—and I will restore your fortunes. And I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places to which I have banished you—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—and I will bring you back to the place from which I have exiled you.
But you say, “The L<small>ORD</small> has raised up prophets for us in Babylon.”<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is continued in vv. 20 ff.</i>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> concerning the king who sits on the throne of David, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your brothers who did not go out with you into exile—
thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts: I am going to let loose sword, famine, and pestilence against them and I will treat them as loathsome figs, so bad that they cannot be eaten.<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. 24.1 ff.</i>
I will pursue them with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence; and I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, a curse and an object of horror and hissing<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. note at 18.16.</i> and scorn among all the nations to which I shall banish them,
because they did not heed My words—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—when I persistently sent to them My servants, the prophets, and they<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “you.”</i> did not heed—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
But you, the whole exile community which I banished from Jerusalem to Babylon, hear the word of the L<small>ORD</small>!
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who prophesy falsely to you in My name: I am going to deliver them into the hands of King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, and he shall put them to death before your eyes.
And the whole community of Judah in Babylonia shall use a curse derived from their fate: “May God make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon consigned to the flames!”—
because they did vile things in Israel, committing adultery with the wives of their fellows and speaking in My name false words which I had not commanded them. I am He who knows and bears witness—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
Concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite you<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., Jeremiah.</i> shall say:
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: Because you sent letters in your own name to all the people in Jerusalem, to Zephaniah son of Maaseiah and to the rest of the priests, as follows,
“The L<small>ORD</small> appointed you priest in place of the priest Jehoiada, <sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “that there might be officials.”</i>to exercise authority<sup class="endFootnote">-f</sup> in the House of the L<small>ORD</small> over every madman who wants to play the prophet, to put him into the stocks<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> and into the pillory.<sup class="endFootnote">-g</sup>
Now why have you not rebuked Jeremiah the Anathothite, who plays the prophet among you?
For he has actually sent a message to us in Babylon to this effect: It will be a long time. Build houses and live in them, plant gardens and enjoy their fruit.”—<br>
When the priest Zephaniah read this letter in the hearing of the prophet Jeremiah,
the word of the L<small>ORD</small> came to Jeremiah:
Send a message to the entire exile community: “Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah prophesied to you, though I did not send him, and made you false promises,
assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: I am going to punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his offspring. There shall be no man of his line dwelling among this people or seeing the good things I am going to do for My people—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—for he has urged disloyalty toward the L<small>ORD</small>.”

Chapter 30

The word which came to Jeremiah from the L<small>ORD</small>:
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of Israel: Write down in a scroll all the words that I have spoken to you.
For days are coming—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—when I will restore the fortunes of My people Israel and Judah, said the L<small>ORD</small>; and I will bring them back to the land that I gave their fathers, and they shall possess it.
And these are the words that the L<small>ORD</small> spoke concerning Israel and Judah:<br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>We have heard cries of panic,<br>Terror without relief.
Ask and see:<br>Surely males do not bear young!<br>Why then do I see every man<br>With his hands on his loins<br>Like a woman in labor?<br>Why have all faces turned pale?
Ah, that day is awesome;<br>There is none like it!<br>It is a time of trouble for Jacob,<br>But he shall be delivered from it.
In that day—declares the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts—I will break the yoke from off your neck and I will rip off your bonds. Strangers shall no longer make slaves of them;
instead, they shall serve the L<small>ORD</small> their God and David, the king whom I will raise up for them.<br>
But you,<br>Have no fear, My servant Jacob<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>Be not dismayed, O Israel!<br>I will deliver you from far away,<br>Your folk from their land of captivity.<br>And Jacob shall again have calm<br>And quiet with none to trouble him;
For I am with you to deliver you<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>I will make an end of all the nations<br>Among which I have dispersed you;<br>But I will not make an end of you!<br>I will not leave you unpunished,<br>But will chastise you in measure.<br>
For thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>Your injury is incurable,<br>Your wound severe;
<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>No one pleads for the healing of your sickness,<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br>There is no remedy, no recovery for you.
All your lovers have forgotten you,<br>They do not seek you out;<br>For I have struck you as an enemy strikes,<br>With cruel chastisement,<br>Because your iniquity was so great<br>And your sins so many.
Why cry out over your injury,<br>That your wound is incurable?<br>I did these things to you<br>Because your iniquity was so great<br>And your sins so many.<br>
Assuredly,<br>All who wanted to devour you shall be devoured,<br>And every one of your foes shall go into captivity;<br>Those who despoiled you shall be despoiled,<br>And all who pillaged you I will give up to pillage.
But I will bring healing to you<br>And cure you of your wounds<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.<br><br>Though they called you “Outcast,<br>That Zion whom no one seeks out,”
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>I will restore the fortunes of Jacob’s tents<br>And have compassion upon his dwellings.<br>The city shall be rebuilt on its mound,<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., on the mound of ruins left after its previous destruction.</i><br>And the fortress in its proper place.
From them shall issue thanksgiving<br>And the sound of dancers.<br>I will multiply them,<br>And they shall not be few;<br>I will make them honored,<br>And they shall not be humbled.
His children shall be as of old,<br>And his community shall be established by My grace;<br>And I will deal with all his oppressors.
His chieftain shall be one of his own,<br>His ruler shall come from his midst;<br>I will bring him near, that he may approach Me<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>For who would otherwise dare approach Me?
You shall be My people,<br>And I will be your God.<br>
Lo, the storm of the L<small>ORD</small> goes forth in fury,<br>A raging tempest;<br>It shall whirl down upon the head of the wicked.
The anger of the L<small>ORD</small> shall not turn back<br>Till it has fulfilled and completed His purposes.<br>In the days to come<br>You shall perceive it.

Chapter 31

<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “The Lord has saved His people.”</i>At that time—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—I will be God to all the clans of Israel, and they shall be My people.<br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>The people escaped from the sword,<br>Found favor in the wilderness;<br>When Israel was marching homeward
The L<small>ORD</small> revealed Himself to me<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “him.”</i> of old.<br>Eternal love I conceived for you then;<br>Therefore I continue My grace to you.
I will build you firmly again,<br>O Maiden Israel!<br>Again you shall take up your timbrels<br>And go forth to the rhythm of the dancers.
Again you shall plant vineyards<br>On the hills of Samaria;<br>Men shall plant and live to enjoy them.
For the day is coming when watchmen<br>Shall proclaim on the heights of Ephraim:<br>Come, let us go up to Zion,<br>To the L<small>ORD</small> our God!<br>
For thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>Cry out in joy for Jacob,<br>Shout at the crossroads<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “head.”</i> of the nations!<br>Sing aloud in praise, and say:<br><sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “The Lord has saved His people.”</i>Save, O L<small>ORD</small>, Your people,<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup><br>The remnant of Israel.
I will bring them in from the northland,<br>Gather them from the ends of the earth—<br>The blind and the lame among them,<br>Those with child and those in labor—<br>In a vast throng they shall return here.
They shall come with weeping,<br>And with compassion<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">For this meaning, cf.

Hear the word of the L<small>ORD</small>, O nations,<br>And tell it in the isles afar.<br>Say:<br>He who scattered Israel will gather them,<br>And will guard them as a shepherd his flock.
For the L<small>ORD</small> will ransom Jacob,<br>Redeem him from one too strong for him.
They shall come and shout on the heights of Zion,<br>Radiant over the bounty of the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>Over new grain and wine and oil,<br>And over sheep and cattle.<br>They shall fare like a watered garden,<br>They shall never languish again.
Then shall maidens dance gaily,<br>Young men and old alike.<br>I will turn their mourning to joy,<br>I will comfort them and cheer them in their grief.
I will give the priests their fill of fatness,<br>And My people shall enjoy My full bounty<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>A cry is heard <sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Or “on a height.”</i>in Ramah<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup>—<br>Wailing, bitter weeping—<br>Rachel weeping for her children.<br>She refuses to be comforted<br>For her children, who are gone.
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>Restrain your voice from weeping,<br>Your eyes from shedding tears;<br>For there is a reward for your labor<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>They shall return from the enemy’s land.
And there is hope for your future<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>Your children shall return to their country.<br>
I can hear Ephraim lamenting:<br>You have chastised me, and I am chastised<br>Like a calf that has not been broken.<br>Receive me back, let me return,<br>For You, O L<small>ORD</small>, are my God.
Now that I have turned back, I am filled with remorse;<br>Now that I am made aware, I strike my thigh.<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., as a gesture of self-reproach.</i><br>I am ashamed and humiliated,<br>For I bear the disgrace of my youth.

Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: They shall again say this in the land of Judah and in its towns, when I restore their fortunes:<br>“The L<small>ORD</small> bless you,<br>Abode of righteousness,<br>O holy mountain!”
Judah and all its towns alike shall be inhabited by the farmers and <sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “they shall travel.”</i>such as move about<sup class="endFootnote">-i</sup> with the flocks.
For I will give the thirsty abundant drink, and satisfy all who languish.<br>
At this I awoke and looked about, and my sleep<sup class="footnote-marker">j</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the vision in the preceding verses.</i> had been pleasant to me.<br>
See, a time is coming—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—when I will sow the House of Israel and the House of Judah with seed of men and seed of cattle;
and just as I was watchful over them to uproot and to pull down, to overthrow and to destroy and to bring disaster, so I will be watchful over them to build and to plant—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
In those days, they shall no longer say, “Parents have eaten sour grapes and children’s teeth are blunted.”<sup class="footnote-marker">k</sup><i class="footnote">Others “set on edge.”</i>
But every one shall die for his own sins: whosoever eats sour grapes, his teeth shall be blunted.
See, a time is coming—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—when I will make a new covenant with the House of Israel and the House of Judah.
It will not be like the covenant I made with their fathers, when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, a covenant which they broke, though I espoused<sup class="footnote-marker">l</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain; compare 3.14.</i> them—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
But such is the covenant I will make with the House of Israel after these days—declares the L<small>ORD</small>: I will put My Teaching into their inmost being and inscribe it upon their hearts. Then I will be their God, and they shall be My people.
No longer will they need to teach one another and say to one another, “Heed the L<small>ORD</small>”; for all of them, from the least of them to the greatest, shall heed Me—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.<br><br>For I will forgive their iniquities,<br>And remember their sins no more.<br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>Who established the sun for light by day,<br>The laws of moon and stars for light by night,<br>Who stirs up the sea into roaring waves,<br>Whose name is L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts:
If these laws should ever be annulled by Me<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>Only then would the offspring of Israel cease<br>To be a nation before Me for all time.<br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: If the heavens above could be measured, and the foundations of the earth below could be fathomed, only then would I reject all the offspring of Israel for all that they have done—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>
See, a time is coming—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—when the city shall be rebuilt for the L<small>ORD</small> from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate;
and the measuring line shall go straight out to the Gareb Hill, and then turn toward Goah.
And the entire Valley of the Corpses and Ashes, and all the fields as far as the Wadi Kidron, and the corner of the Horse Gate on the east, shall be holy to the L<small>ORD</small>. They shall never again be uprooted or overthrown.

Chapter 32

The word which came to Jeremiah from the L<small>ORD</small> in the tenth year of King Zedekiah of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.
At that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and the prophet Jeremiah was confined in the prison compound attached to the palace of the king of Judah.
For King Zedekiah of Judah had confined him, saying, “How dare you prophesy: ‘Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: I am delivering this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall capture it.
And King Zedekiah of Judah shall not escape from the Chaldeans; he shall be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon, <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “and his mouth shall speak with his mouth, and his eyes shall see his eyes.”</i>and he shall speak to him face to face and see him in person.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>
And Zedekiah shall be brought to Babylon, there to remain until I take note of him—declares the L<small>ORD</small>. When you wage war against the Chaldeans, you shall not be successful.’”<br>
Jeremiah said: The word of the L<small>ORD</small> came to me:
Hanamel, the son of your uncle Shallum, will come to you and say, “Buy my land in Anathoth, <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “for yours is the procedure of redemption by purchase.”</i>for you are next in succession to redeem it by purchase.”<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
And just as the L<small>ORD</small> had said, my cousin Hanamel came to me in the prison compound and said to me, “Please buy my land in Anathoth, in the territory of Benjamin; for the right of succession is yours, and you have the duty of redemption. Buy it.” Then I knew that it was indeed the word of the L<small>ORD</small>.
So I bought the land in Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel. I weighed out the money to him, seventeen shekels of silver.
I wrote a deed, sealed it, and had it witnessed; and I weighed out the silver on a balance.
I took the deed of purchase, the sealed text and the open one <sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Force of Heb. uncertain.</i>according to rule and law,<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup>
and gave the deed to Baruch son of Neriah son of Mahseiah in the presence of my kinsman Hanamel, of the witnesses <sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">With many mss. and ancient versions; so ancient Near Eastern practice. Other mss. and the editions read “who wrote” (i.e., signed their names).</i>who were named<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup> in the deed, and all the Judeans who were sitting in the prison compound.
In their presence I charged Baruch as follows:
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: “Take these documents, this deed of purchase, the sealed text and the open one, and put them into an earthen jar, so that they may last a long time.”
For thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: “Houses, fields, and vineyards shall again be purchased in this land.”<br>
But after I had given the deed to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to the L<small>ORD</small>:
“Ah, Lord G<small>OD</small>! You made heaven and earth with Your great might and outstretched arm. Nothing is too wondrous for You!
You show kindness to the thousandth generation, but visit the guilt of the fathers upon their children after them. O great and mighty God whose name is L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts,
wondrous in purpose and mighty in deed, whose eyes observe all the ways of men, so as to repay every man according to his ways, and with the proper fruit of his deeds!
You displayed signs and marvels in the land of Egypt <sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “to this day.”</i>with lasting effect,<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup> and won renown in Israel and among mankind to this very day.
You freed Your people Israel from the land of Egypt with signs and marvels, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terror.
You gave them this land that You had sworn to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey,
and they came and took possession of it. But they did not listen to You or follow Your Teaching; they did nothing of what You commanded them to do. Therefore you have caused all this misfortune to befall them.
Here are the siegemounds, raised against the city to storm it; and the city, because of sword and famine and pestilence, is at the mercy of the Chaldeans who are attacking it. What You threatened has come to pass—as You see.
Yet You, Lord G<small>OD</small>, said to me: Buy the land for money and call in witnesses—when the city is at the mercy of the Chaldeans!”<br>
Then the word of the L<small>ORD</small> came to Jeremiah:
“Behold I am the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of all flesh. Is anything too wondrous for Me?
Assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: I am delivering this city into the hands of the Chaldeans and of King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, and he shall capture it.
And the Chaldeans who have been attacking this city shall come and set this city on fire and burn it down—with the houses on whose roofs they made offerings to Baal and poured out libations to other gods, so as to vex Me.
For the people of Israel and Judah have done nothing but evil in My sight since their youth; the people of Israel have done nothing but vex Me by their conduct—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
This city has aroused My anger and My wrath from the day it was built until this day; so that it must be removed from My sight
because of all the wickedness of the people of Israel and Judah who have so acted as to vex Me—they, their kings, their officials, their priests and prophets, and the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
They turned their backs to Me, not their faces; though I have taught them persistently, they do not give heed or accept rebuke.
They placed their abominations in the House which bears My name and defiled it;
and they built the shrines of Baal which are in the Valley of Ben-hinnom, where they offered up their sons and daughters to Molech—when I had never commanded, or even thought [of commanding], that they should do such an abominable thing, and so bring guilt on Judah.<br>
But now, assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of Israel, concerning this city of which you say, “It is being delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon through the sword, through famine, and through pestilence”:
See, I will gather them from all the lands to which I have banished them in My anger and wrath, and in great rage; and I will bring them back to this place and let them dwell secure.
They shall be My people, and I will be their God.
I will give them a single heart and a single nature to revere Me for all time, and it shall be well with them and their children after them.
And I will make an everlasting covenant with them that I will not turn away from them and that I will treat them graciously; and I will put into their hearts reverence for Me, so that they do not turn away from Me.
I will delight in treating them graciously, and I will plant them in this land faithfully, with all My heart and soul.<br>
For thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: As I have brought this terrible disaster upon this people, so I am going to bring upon them the vast good fortune which I have promised for them.
And fields shall again be purchased in this land of which you say, “It is a desolation, without man or beast; it is delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans.”
Fields shall be purchased, and deeds written and sealed, and witnesses called in the land of Benjamin and in the environs of Jerusalem, and in the towns of Judah; the towns of the hill country, the towns of the Shephelah, and the towns of the Negeb. For I will restore their fortunes—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.

Chapter 33

The word of the L<small>ORD</small> came to Jeremiah a second time, while he was still confined in the prison compound, as follows:<br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> who is planning it,<br>The L<small>ORD</small> who is shaping it to bring it about,<br>Whose name is L<small>ORD</small>:
Call to Me, and I will answer you,<br>And I will tell you wondrous things,<br>Secrets you have not known.<br>
For thus said the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and the palaces of the kings of Judah that were torn down <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>for [defense] against the siegemounds and against the sword,
and were filled by those who went to fight the Chaldeans,<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>—with the corpses of the men whom I struck down in My anger and rage, hiding My face from this city because of all their wickedness:
I am going to bring her relief and healing. I will heal them and reveal to them abundance<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> of true favor.
And I will restore the fortunes of Judah and Israel, and I will rebuild them as of old.
And I will purge them of all the sins which they committed against Me, and I will pardon all the sins which they committed against Me, by which they rebelled against Me.
And she shall gain through Me renown, joy, fame, and glory above all the nations on earth, when they hear of all the good fortune I provide for them.<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., for Judah and Israel.</i> They will thrill and quiver because of all the good fortune and all the prosperity that I provide for her.
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: Again there shall be heard in this place, which you say is ruined, without man or beast—in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man, without inhabitants, without beast—
the sound of mirth and gladness, the voice of bridegroom and bride, the voice of those who cry, “Give thanks to the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, for the L<small>ORD</small> is good, for His kindness is everlasting!” as they bring thanksgiving offerings to the House of the L<small>ORD</small>. For I will restore the fortunes of the land as of old—said the L<small>ORD</small>.
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts: In this ruined place, without man and beast, and in all its towns, there shall again be a pasture for shepherds, where they can rest their flocks.
In the towns of the hill country, in the towns of the Shephelah, and in the towns of the Negeb, in the land of Benjamin and in the environs of Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah, sheep shall pass again under the hands of one who counts them—said the L<small>ORD</small>.
See, days are coming—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—when I will fulfill the promise that I made concerning the House of Israel and the House of Judah.
In those days and at that time, I will raise up a true branch of David’s line, and he shall do what is just and right in the land.
In those days Judah shall be delivered and Jerusalem shall dwell secure. And this is what she shall be called: “The L<small>ORD</small> is our Vindicator.”
For thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: There shall never be an end to men of David’s line who sit upon the throne of the House of Israel.
Nor shall there ever be an end to the line of the levitical priests before Me, of those who present burnt offerings and turn the meal offering to smoke and perform sacrifices.<br>
The word of the L<small>ORD</small> came to Jeremiah:
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: If you could break My covenant with the day and My covenant with the night, so that day and night should not come at their proper time,
only then could My covenant with My servant David be broken—so that he would not have a descendant reigning upon his throne—or with My ministrants, the levitical priests.
Like the host of heaven which cannot be counted, and the sand of the sea which cannot be measured, so will I multiply the offspring of My servant David, and of the Levites who minister to Me.<br>
The word of the L<small>ORD</small> came to Jeremiah:
You see what this people said: “The two families which the L<small>ORD</small> chose have now been rejected by Him.” Thus they despise My people, <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>and regard them as no longer a nation.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: As surely as I have established My covenant with day and night—the laws of heaven and earth—
so I will never reject the offspring of Jacob and My servant David; I will never fail to take from his offspring rulers for the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Indeed, I will restore their fortunes and take them back in love.

Chapter 34

The word which came to Jeremiah from the L<small>ORD</small>, when King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth and all the peoples under his sway, were waging war against Jerusalem and all its towns:
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of Israel: Go speak to King Zedekiah of Judah, and say to him: “Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: I am going to deliver this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will destroy it by fire.
And you will not escape from him; you will be captured and handed over to him. <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">For the idiom see note at 32.4.</i>And you will see the king of Babylon face to face and speak to him in person;<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> and you will be brought to Babylon.
But hear the word of the L<small>ORD</small>, O King Zedekiah of Judah! Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> concerning you: You will not die by the sword.
You will die a peaceful death; and as incense<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “burnings.”</i> was burned for your ancestors, the earlier kings who preceded you, so they will burn incense<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup> for you, and they will lament for you ‘Ah, lord!’ For I Myself have made the promise—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.”
The prophet Jeremiah spoke all these words to King Zedekiah of Judah in Jerusalem,
when the army of the king of Babylon was waging war against Jerusalem and against the remaining towns of Judah—against Lachish and Azekah, for they were the only fortified towns of Judah that were left.<br>
The word which came to Jeremiah from the L<small>ORD</small> after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim a release<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Others “liberty.”</i> among them—
that everyone should set free his Hebrew slaves, both male and female, and that no one should keep his fellow Judean enslaved.
Everyone, officials and people, who had entered into the covenant agreed to set their male and female slaves free and not keep them enslaved any longer; they complied and let them go.
But afterward they turned about and brought back the men and women they had set free, and forced them into slavery again.
Then it was that the word of the L<small>ORD</small> came to Jeremiah from the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, the house of bondage, saying:
“In the seventh year<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., of servitude. Lit. “After a period of seven years”; cf. Deut. 14.28 and 15.1.</i> each of you must let go any fellow Hebrew <sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Or “who sells himself.”</i>who may be sold<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup> to you; when he has served you six years, you must set him free.” But your fathers would not obey Me or give ear.
Lately you turned about and did what is proper in My sight, and each of you proclaimed a release to his countrymen; and you made a covenant accordingly before Me in the House which bears My name.
But now you have turned back and have profaned My name; each of you has brought back the men and women whom you had given their freedom, and forced them to be your slaves again.
Assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: You would not obey Me and proclaim a release, each to his kinsman and countryman. Lo! I proclaim your release—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine; and I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
I will make the men who violated My covenant, who did not fulfill the terms of the covenant which they made before Me, [like] the calf which they cut in two so as to pass between the halves:<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. 15.9–10, 17–21.</i>
The officers of Judah and Jerusalem, the officials, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the halves of the calf
shall be handed over to their enemies, to those who seek to kill them. Their carcasses shall become food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth.
I will hand over King Zedekiah of Judah and his officers to their enemies, who seek to kill them—to the army of the king of Babylon which has withdrawn from you.
I hereby give the command—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—by which I will bring them back against this city. They shall attack it and capture it, and burn it down. I will make the towns of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.

Chapter 35

The word which came to Jeremiah from the L<small>ORD</small> in the days of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah:
Go to the house of the Rechabites and speak to them, and bring them to the House of the L<small>ORD</small>, to one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.
So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah son of Habazziniah, and his brothers, all his sons, and the whole household of the Rechabites;
and I brought them to the House of the L<small>ORD</small>, to the chamber of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which is next to the chamber of the officials and above the chamber of Maaseiah son of Shallum, the guardian of the threshold.
I set bowls full of wine and cups before the men of the house of the Rechabites, and said to them, “Have some wine.”
They replied, “We will not drink wine, for our ancestor, Jonadab son of Rechab, commanded us: ‘You shall never drink wine, either you or your children.
Nor shall you build houses or sow fields<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “seed.”</i> or plant vineyards, nor shall you own such things; but you shall live in tents all your days, so that you may live long upon the land where you sojourn.’
And we have obeyed our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab in all that he commanded us: we never drink wine, neither we nor our wives nor our sons and daughters.
Nor do we build houses to live in, and we do not own vineyards or fields for sowing;
but we live in tents. We have obeyed and done all that our ancestor Jonadab commanded us.
But when King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon invaded the country, we said, ‘Come, let us go into Jerusalem because of the army of the Chaldeans and the army of Aram.’ And so we are living in Jerusalem.”
Then the word of the L<small>ORD</small> came to Jeremiah:
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: Go say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: “You can learn a lesson [here] about obeying My commands—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
The commands of Jonadab son of Rechab have been fulfilled: he charged his children not to drink wine, and to this day they have not drunk, in obedience to the charge of their ancestor. But I spoke to you persistently, and you did not listen to Me.
I persistently sent you all My servants, the prophets, to say: ‘Turn back, every one of you, from your wicked ways and mend your deeds; do not follow other gods or serve them. Then you may remain on the land that I gave to you and your fathers.’ But you did not give ear or listen to Me.
The family of Jonadab son of Rechab have indeed fulfilled the charge which their ancestor gave them; but this people has not listened to Me.
Assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of Hosts, the God of Israel: I am going to bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the disaster with which I have threatened them; for I spoke to them, but they would not listen; I called to them, but they would not respond.”
And to the family of the Rechabites Jeremiah said: “Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have obeyed the charge of your ancestor Jonadab and kept all his commandments, and done all that he enjoined upon you,
assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: There shall never cease to be a man of the line of Jonadab son of Rechab standing before Me.”

Chapter 36

In the fourth year of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the L<small>ORD</small>:
Get a scroll and write upon it all the words that I have spoken to you—concerning Israel and Judah and all the nations—from the time I first spoke to you in the days of Josiah to this day.
Perhaps when the House of Judah hear of all the disasters I intend to bring upon them, they will turn back from their wicked ways, and I will pardon their iniquity and their sin.
So Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote down in the scroll, at Jeremiah’s dictation, all the words which the L<small>ORD</small> had spoken to him.
Jeremiah instructed Baruch, “I am in hiding; I cannot go to the House of the L<small>ORD</small>.
But you go and read aloud the words of the L<small>ORD</small> from the scroll which you wrote at my dictation, to all the people in the House of the L<small>ORD</small> on a fast day; thus you will also be reading them to all the Judeans who come in from the towns.
Perhaps their entreaty will be accepted by the L<small>ORD</small>, if they turn back from their wicked ways. For great is the anger and wrath with which the L<small>ORD</small> has threatened this people.”
Baruch son of Neriah did just as the prophet Jeremiah had instructed him, about reading the words of the L<small>ORD</small> from the scroll in the House of the L<small>ORD</small>.
In the ninth month of the fifth year of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people coming from Judah proclaimed a fast before the L<small>ORD</small> in Jerusalem.
It was then that Baruch—in the chamber of Gemariah son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper court, near the new gateway of the House of the L<small>ORD</small>—read the words of Jeremiah from the scroll to all the people in the House of the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>
Micaiah son of Gemariah son of Shaphan heard all the words of the L<small>ORD</small> [read] from the scroll,
and he went down to the king’s palace, to the chamber of the scribe. There he found all the officials in session: Elishama the scribe, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials.
And Micaiah told them all that he had heard as Baruch read from the scroll in the hearing of the people.
Then all the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah son of Shelemiah son of Cushi to say to Baruch, “Take that scroll from which you read to the people, and come along!” And Baruch took the scroll and came to them.
They said, <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Change of vocalization yields “Read it again”; cf. Targum and Septuagint.</i>“Sit down and read it<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> to us.” And Baruch read it to them.
When they heard all these words, they turned to each other in fear; and they said to Baruch, “We must report all this to the king.”
And they questioned Baruch further, “Tell us how you wrote down all these words <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Force of Heb. uncertain.</i>that he spoke.”<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
He answered them, “He himself recited all those words to me, and I would write them down in the scroll in ink.”
The officials said to Baruch, “Go into hiding, you and Jeremiah. Let no man know where you are!”
And they went to the king in the court, after leaving the scroll in the chamber of the scribe Elishama. And they reported all these matters to the king.
The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll and he fetched it from the chamber of the scribe Elishama. Jehudi read it to the king and to all the officials who were in attendance on the king.
Since it was the ninth month, the king was sitting in the winter house, with a fire burning in the brazier before him.
And every time Jehudi read three or four columns, [the king] would cut it up with a scribe’s knife and throw it into the fire in the brazier, until the entire scroll was consumed by the fire in the brazier.
Yet the king and all his courtiers who heard all these words showed no fear and did not tear their garments;
moreover, Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah begged the king not to burn the scroll, but he would not listen to them.
The king ordered Jerahmeel, the king’s son, and Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest the scribe Baruch and the prophet Jeremiah. But the L<small>ORD</small> hid them.<br>
The word of the L<small>ORD</small> came to Jeremiah after the king had burned the scroll containing the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah’s dictation:
Get yourself another scroll, and write upon it the same words that were in the first scroll that was burned by King Jehoiakim of Judah.
And concerning King Jehoiakim of Judah you shall say: Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: You burned that scroll, saying, “How dare you write in it that the king of Babylon will come and destroy this land and cause man and beast to cease from it?”
Assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small> concerning King Jehoiakim of Judah: He shall not have any of his line sitting on the throne of David; and his own corpse shall be left exposed to the heat by day and the cold by night.
And I will punish him and his offspring and his courtiers for their iniquity; I will bring on them and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem and on all the men of Judah all the disasters of which I have warned them—but they would not listen.
So Jeremiah got another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah. And at Jeremiah’s dictation, he wrote in it the whole text of the scroll that King Jehoiakim of Judah had burned; and more of the like was added.

Chapter 37

Zedekiah son of Josiah became king instead of Coniah son of Jehoiakim, for King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon set him up as king over the land of Judah.
Neither he nor his courtiers nor the people of the land gave heed to the words which the L<small>ORD</small> spoke through the prophet Jeremiah.<br>
Yet King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah son of the priest Maaseiah to the prophet Jeremiah, to say, “Please pray on our behalf to the L<small>ORD</small> our God.”
(Jeremiah could still go in and out among the people, for they had not yet put him in prison.
The army of Pharaoh had set out from Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard the report, they raised the siege of Jerusalem.)
Then the word of the L<small>ORD</small> came to the prophet Jeremiah:
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of Israel: Thus shall you say to the king of Judah who sent you to Me to inquire of Me: “The army of Pharaoh, which set out to help you, will return to its own land, to Egypt.
And the Chaldeans will come back and attack this city and they will capture it and destroy it by fire.”
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: Do not delude yourselves into thinking, “The Chaldeans will go away from us.” They will not.
Even if you defeated the whole army of the Chaldeans that are fighting against you, and only wounded men were left lying in their tents, they would get up and burn this city down!<br>
When the army of the Chaldeans raised the siege of Jerusalem on account of the army of Pharaoh,
Jeremiah was going to leave Jerusalem and go to the territory of Benjamin <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>to share in some property there<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> among the people.
When he got to the Benjamin Gate, there was a guard officer there named Irijah son of Shelemiah son of Hananiah; and he arrested the prophet Jeremiah, saying, “You are defecting to the Chaldeans!”
Jeremiah answered, “That’s a lie! I’m not defecting to the Chaldeans!” But Irijah would not listen to him; he arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials.
The officials were furious with Jeremiah; they beat him and put him into prison, in the house of the scribe Jonathan—for it had been made into a jail.
Thus Jeremiah came to the <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>pit and the cells,<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> and Jeremiah remained there a long time.
Then King Zedekiah sent for him, and the king questioned him secretly in his palace. He asked, “Is there any word from the L<small>ORD</small>?” “There is!” Jeremiah answered, and he continued, “You will be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon.”
And Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “What wrong have I done to you, to your courtiers, and to this people, that you have put me in jail?
And where are those prophets of yours who prophesied to you that the king of Babylon would never move against you and against this land?
Now, please hear me, O lord king, and grant my plea: Don’t send me back to the house of the scribe Jonathan <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “and let me not die there.”</i>to die there.”<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
So King Zedekiah gave instructions to lodge Jeremiah in the prison compound and to supply him daily with a loaf of bread from the Bakers’ Street—until all the bread in the city was gone. Jeremiah remained in the prison compound.

Chapter 38

Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malchiah heard what Jeremiah was saying to all the people:
“Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: Whoever remains in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence; but whoever surrenders to the Chaldeans shall live; <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “he shall have his life as booty”; cf. 21.9.</i>he shall at least gain his life<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> and shall live.
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: This city shall be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon’s army, and he shall capture it.”
Then the officials said to the king, “Let that man be put to death, for he disheartens<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “weakens the hands of.”</i> the soldiers, and all the people who are left in this city, by speaking such things to them. That man is not seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm!”
King Zedekiah replied, “He is in your hands; the king cannot oppose you in anything!”
So they took Jeremiah and put him down in the pit of Malchiah, the king’s son, which was in the prison compound; they let Jeremiah down by ropes. There was no water in the pit, only mud, and Jeremiah sank into the mud.
Ebed-melech the Cushite, a eunuch who was in the king’s palace, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the pit. The king was then sitting at the Benjamin Gate;
so Ebed-melech left the king’s palace, and spoke to the king:
“O lord king, those men have acted wickedly in all they did to the prophet Jeremiah; they have put him down in the pit, to die there of hunger.” For there was no more bread in the city.
Then the king instructed Ebed-melech the Cushite, “Take with you thirty<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">One ms. reads “three.”</i> men from here, and pull the prophet Jeremiah up from the pit before he dies.”
So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went to the king’s palace, to <sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “the wardrobe of.”</i>a place below<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup> the treasury. There they got worn cloths and rags, which they let down to Jeremiah in the pit by ropes.
And Ebed-melech the Cushite called to Jeremiah, “Put the worn cloths and rags under your armpits, inside the ropes.” Jeremiah did so,
and they pulled Jeremiah up by the ropes and got him out of the pit. And Jeremiah remained in the prison compound.<br>
King Zedekiah sent for the prophet Jeremiah, and had him brought to him at the third entrance of the House of the L<small>ORD</small>. And the king said to Jeremiah, “I want to ask you something; don’t conceal anything from me.”
Jeremiah answered the king, “If I tell you, you’ll surely kill me; and if I give you advice, you won’t listen to me.”
Thereupon King Zedekiah secretly promised Jeremiah on oath: “As the L<small>ORD</small> lives who has <sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>given us this life,<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup> I will not put you to death or leave you in the hands of those men who seek your life.”
Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of Hosts, the God of Israel: If you surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, your life will be spared and this city will not be burned down. You and your household will live.
But if you do not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, this city will be delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans, who will burn it down; and you will not escape from them.”
King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am worried about the Judeans who have defected to the Chaldeans; that they [the Chaldeans] might hand me over to them to abuse me.”
“They will not hand you over,” Jeremiah replied. “Listen to the voice of the L<small>ORD</small>, to what I tell you, that it may go well with you and your life be spared.
For this is what the L<small>ORD</small> has shown me if you refuse to surrender:
All the women who are left in the palace of the king of Judah shall be brought out to the officers of the king of Babylon; and they shall say:<br>The men who were your friends<br>Have seduced you and vanquished you.<br>Now that your feet are sunk in the mire,<br>They have turned their backs [on you].
They will bring out all your wives and children to the Chaldeans, and you yourself will not escape from them. You will be captured by the king of Babylon, and <sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">So Targum and Septuagint and some mss. Most mss. and the editions read “you will burn down this city by fire.”</i>this city shall be burned down.”<sup class="endFootnote">-f</sup>
Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Don’t let anyone know about this conversation, <sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “that you may not die.”</i>or you will die.<sup class="endFootnote">-g</sup>
If the officials should hear that I have spoken with you, and they should come and say to you, ‘Tell us what you said to the king; hide nothing from us, <sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “that we may not kill you.”</i>or we’ll kill you.<sup class="endFootnote">-h</sup> And what did the king say to you?’
say to them, ‘I was presenting my petition to the king not to send me back to the house of Jonathan to die there.’”
All the officials did come to Jeremiah to question him; and he replied to them just as the king had instructed him. So they stopped questioning him, for the conversation had not been overheard.
Jeremiah remained in the prison compound until the day Jerusalem was captured.<br>When Jerusalem was captured…<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">This clause would read well before 39.3.</i>

Chapter 39

In the ninth year of King Zedekiah of Judah, in the tenth month, King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon moved against Jerusalem with his whole army, and they laid siege to it.
And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, on the ninth day of the fourth month, the [walls of] the city were breached.
All the officers of the king of Babylon entered, and took up quarters at the middle gate—Nergal-sarezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim the Rab-saris,<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Titles of officers.</i> Nergal-sarezer the Rab-mag,<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> and all the rest of the officers of the king of Babylon.
When King Zedekiah of Judah saw them, he and all the soldiers fled. They left the city at night, by way of the king’s garden, through the gate between the double walls; and he set out toward the Arabah.<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Hoping to escape across the Jordan.</i>
But the Chaldean troops pursued them, and they overtook Zedekiah in the steppes of Jericho. They captured him and brought him before King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon at Riblah in the region of Hamath; and he put him on trial.
The king of Babylon had Zedekiah’s children slaughtered at Riblah before his eyes; the king of Babylon had all the nobles of Judah slaughtered.
Then the eyes of Zedekiah were put out and he was chained in bronze fetters, that he might be brought to Babylon.
The Chaldeans burned down the king’s palace and the houses<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Taking Heb. singular as collective, with Kimhi.</i> of the people by fire, and they tore down the walls of Jerusalem.
The remnant of the people that was left in the city, and the defectors who had gone over to him—the remnant of the people that was left—were exiled by Nebuzaradan, the chief of the guards, to Babylon.
But some of the poorest people who owned nothing were left in the land of Judah by Nebuzaradan, the chief of the guards, and he gave them vineyards and fields at that time.
King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon had given orders to Nebuzaradan, the chief of the guards, concerning Jeremiah:
“Take him and look after him; do him no harm, but grant whatever he asks of you.”
So Nebuzaradan, the chief of the guards, and Nebushazban the Rab-saris, and Nergal-sarezer the Rab-mag, and all the commanders of the king of Babylon sent
and had Jeremiah brought from the prison compound. They committed him to the care of Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, <sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>that he might be left at liberty in a house.<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup> So he dwelt among the people.<br>
The word of the L<small>ORD</small> had come to Jeremiah while he was still confined in the prison compound:
Go and say to Ebed-melech the Cushite: “Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: I am going to fulfill My words concerning this city—for disaster, not for good—and they shall come true on that day in your presence.
But I will save you on that day—declares the L<small>ORD</small>; you shall not be delivered into the hands of the men you dread.
I will rescue you, and you shall not fall by the sword. <sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">See note at 38.2.</i>You shall escape with your life,<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup> because you trusted Me—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.”

Chapter 40

The word that came to Jeremiah from the L<small>ORD</small>, after Nebuzaradan, the chief of the guards, set him free at Ramah, to which he had taken him, chained in fetters, among those from Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon.
The chief of the guards took charge of Jeremiah, and he said to him, “The L<small>ORD</small> your God threatened this place with this disaster;
and now the L<small>ORD</small> has brought it about. He has acted as He threatened, because you sinned against the L<small>ORD</small> and did not obey Him. That is why this has happened to you.
Now, I release you this day from the fetters which were on your hands. If you would like to go with me to Babylon, come, and I will look after you. And if you don’t want to come with me to Babylon, you need not. See, the whole land is before you: go wherever seems good and right to you.”—
<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>But [Jeremiah] still did not turn back.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>—“Or go to Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has put in charge of the towns of Judah, and stay with him among the people, or go wherever you want to go.”<br><br>The chief of the guards gave him an allowance of food, and dismissed him.
So Jeremiah came to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah, and stayed with him among the people who were left in the land.<br>
The officers of the troops in the open country, and their men with them, heard that the king of Babylon had put Gedaliah son of Ahikam in charge of the region, and that he had put in his charge the men, women, and children—of the poorest in the land—those who had not been exiled to Babylon.
So they with their men came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael son of Nethaniah; Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah; Seraiah son of Tanhumeth; the sons of Ephai the Netophathite; and Jezaniah son of the Maacathite.
Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan reassured<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “swore to.”</i> them and their men, saying, “Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Stay in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you.
I am going to stay in Mizpah to attend upon the Chaldeans who will come to us. But you may gather wine and figs<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “summer fruit.”</i> and oil and put them in your own vessels, and settle in the towns you have occupied.”
Likewise, all the Judeans who were in Moab, Ammon, and Edom, or who were in other lands, heard that the king of Babylon had let a remnant stay in Judah, and that he had put Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan in charge of them.
All these Judeans returned from all the places to which they had scattered. They came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and they gathered large quantities of wine and figs.<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “summer fruit.”</i>
Johanan son of Kareah, and all the officers of the troops in the open country, came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
and said to him, “Do you know that King Baalis of Ammon has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to kill you?” But Gedaliah son of Ahikam would not believe them.
Johanan son of Kareah also said secretly to Gedaliah at Mizpah, “Let me go and strike down Ishmael son of Nethaniah before anyone knows about it; otherwise he will kill you, and all the Judeans who have gathered about you will be dispersed, and the remnant of Judah will perish!”
But Gedaliah son of Ahikam answered Johanan son of Kareah, “Do not do such a thing: what you are saying about Ishmael is not true!”

Chapter 41

In the seventh month, Ishmael son of Nethaniah son of Elishama, who was of royal descent and one of the king’s commanders, came with ten men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah; and they ate together there at Mizpah.
Then Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him arose and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan with the sword and killed him, because the king of Babylon had put him in charge of the land.
Ishmael also killed all the Judeans who were with him—with Gedaliah in Mizpah—and the Chaldean soldiers who were stationed there.
The second day after Gedaliah was killed, when no one yet knew about it,
eighty men came from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria, their beards shaved, their garments torn, and their bodies gashed, carrying meal offerings and frankincense to present at the House of the L<small>ORD</small>.
Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he walked. As he met them, he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam.”
When they came inside the town, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men who were with him slaughtered them [and threw their bodies] into a cistern.
But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, “Don’t kill us! We have stores hidden in a field—wheat, barley, oil, and honey.” So he stopped, and did not kill them along with their fellows.—
The cistern into which Ishmael threw all the corpses of the men he had killed <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Septuagint reads “was a large cistern, which…”</i>in the affair of Gedaliah was the one that<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> King Asa had constructed on account of King Baasha of Israel. That was the one which Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled with corpses.—
Ishmael carried off all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah, including the daughters of the king—all the people left in Mizpah, over whom Nebuzaradan, the chief of the guards, had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah carried them off, and set out to cross over to the Ammonites.
Johanan son of Kareah, and all the army officers with him, heard of all the crimes committed by Ishmael son of Nethaniah.
They took all their men and went to fight against Ishmael son of Nethaniah; and they encountered him by the great pool in Gibeon.
When all the people held by Ishmael saw Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers with him, they were glad;
all the people whom Ishmael had carried off from Mizpah turned back and went over to Johanan son of Kareah.
But Ishmael son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.
Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers with him took all the rest of the people whom <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “Ishmael son of Nethaniah had carried off.”</i>he had rescued from Ishmael son of Nethaniah<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup> from Mizpah after he had murdered Gedaliah son of Ahikam—the men, soldiers, women, children, and eunuchs whom [Johanan] had brought back from Gibeon.
They set out, and they stopped at Geruth<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Aquila reads “the sheepfolds of.”</i> Chimham, near Bethlehem, on their way to go to Egypt
because of the Chaldeans. For they were afraid of them, because Ishmael son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had put in charge of the land.

Chapter 42

Then all the army officers, with Johanan son of Kareah, Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah, and all the rest of the people, great and small, approached
the prophet Jeremiah and said, “Grant our plea, and pray for us to the L<small>ORD</small> your God, for all this remnant! For we remain but a few out of many, as you can see.
Let the L<small>ORD</small> your God tell us where we should go and what we should do.”
The prophet Jeremiah answered them, “Agreed: I will pray to the L<small>ORD</small> your God as you request, and I will tell you whatever response the L<small>ORD</small> gives for you. I will withhold nothing from you.”
Thereupon they said to Jeremiah, “Let the L<small>ORD</small> be a true and faithful witness against us! We swear that we will do exactly as the L<small>ORD</small> your God instructs us through you—
Whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, we will obey the L<small>ORD</small> our God to whom we send you, in order that it may go well with us when we obey the L<small>ORD</small> our God.”<br>
After ten days, the word of the L<small>ORD</small> came to Jeremiah.
He called Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers, and the rest of the people, great and small,
and said to them, “Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your supplication before Him:
If you remain in this land, I will build you and not overthrow, I will plant you and not uproot; for I regret the punishment I have brought upon you.
Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you fear; do not be afraid of him—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—for I am with you to save you and to rescue you from his hands.
I will dispose him to be merciful to you: he shall show you mercy and <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Change of vocalization yields “let you dwell in.”</i>bring you back to<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> your own land.
“But if you say, ‘We will not stay in this land’—thus disobeying the L<small>ORD</small> your God—
if you say, ‘No! We will go to the land of Egypt, so that we may not see war or hear the sound of the horn, and so that we may not hunger for bread; there we will stay,’
then hear the word of the L<small>ORD</small>, O remnant of Judah! Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: If you turn your faces toward Egypt, and you go and sojourn there,
the sword that you fear shall overtake you there, in the land of Egypt, and the famine you worry over shall follow at your heels in Egypt too; and there you shall die.
All the men who turn their faces toward Egypt, in order to sojourn there, shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. They shall have no surviving remnant of the disaster that I will bring upon them.
For thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: As My anger and wrath were poured out upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so will My wrath be poured out on you if you go to Egypt. You shall become <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a standard by which men execrate and curse; cf. note at 24.9.</i>an execration of woe, a curse<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup> and a mockery; and you shall never again see this place.
The L<small>ORD</small> has spoken against you, O remnant of Judah! Do not go to Egypt! Know well, then—for I warn you this day
that you were deceitful at heart when you sent me to the L<small>ORD</small> your God, saying, ‘Pray for us to the L<small>ORD</small> our God; and whatever the L<small>ORD</small> our God may say, just tell us and we will do it.’
I told you today, and you have not obeyed the L<small>ORD</small> your God in respect to all that He sent me to tell you—
know well, then, that you shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence in the place where you want to go and sojourn.”

Chapter 43

When Jeremiah had finished speaking all these words to all the people—all the words of the L<small>ORD</small> their God, with which the L<small>ORD</small> their God had sent him to them—
Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the arrogant men said to Jeremiah, “You are lying! The L<small>ORD</small> our God did not send you to say, ‘Don’t go to Egypt and sojourn there’!
It is Baruch son of Neriah who is inciting you against us, so that we will be delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans to be killed or to be exiled to Babylon!”
So Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers and the rest of the people did not obey the L<small>ORD</small>’s command to remain in the land of Judah.
Instead, Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers took the entire remnant of Judah—those who had returned from all the countries to which they had been scattered and had sojourned in the land of Judah,
men, women, and children; and the daughters of the king and all the people whom Nebuzaradan the chief of the guards had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, as well as the prophet Jeremiah and Baruch son of Neriah—
and they went to Egypt. They did not obey the L<small>ORD</small>.<br><br>They arrived at Tahpanhes,
and the word of the L<small>ORD</small> came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes:
Get yourself large stones, and embed them in mortar in the brick structure at the entrance to Pharaoh’s palace in Tahpanhes, with some Judeans looking on.
And say to them: “Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: I am sending for My servant King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, and I<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Septuagint reads “he.”</i> will set his throne over these stones which I have embedded. He will spread out his pavilion<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> over them.
He will come and attack the land of Egypt, delivering<br>Those destined for the plague, to the plague,<br>Those destined for captivity, to captivity,<br>And those destined for the sword, to the sword.<br>
And I<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Septuagint reads “he.”</i> will set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt; he will burn them down and carry them<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the gods.</i> off. He shall wrap himself up in the land of Egypt, as a shepherd wraps himself up in his garment. And he shall depart from there in safety.
He shall smash the obelisks of the Temple of the Sun which is in the land of Egypt, and he shall burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt.

Chapter 44

The word which came to Jeremiah for all the Judeans living in the land of Egypt, living in Migdol, Tahpanhes, and Noph, and in the land of Pathros:
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: You have seen all the disaster that I brought on Jerusalem and on all the towns of Judah. They are a ruin today, and no one inhabits them,
on account of the wicked things they did to vex Me, going to make offerings in worship of other gods which they had not known—neither they nor you nor your fathers.
Yet I persistently sent to you all My servants the prophets, to say, “I beg you not to do this abominable thing which I hate.”
But they would not listen or give ear, to turn back from their wickedness and not make offerings to other gods;
so My fierce anger was poured out, and it blazed against the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem. And they became a desolate ruin, as they still are today.
And now, thus said the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of Hosts, the God of Israel: Why are you doing such great harm to yourselves, so that every man and woman, child and infant of yours shall be cut off from the midst of Judah, and no remnant shall be left of you?
For you vex me by your deeds, making offering to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have come to sojourn, so that you shall be cut off and become a curse<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">See note at 24.9; 42.18.</i> and a mockery among all the nations of earth.
Have you forgotten the wicked acts of your forefathers, of the kings of Judah and their<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “his.”</i> wives, and your own wicked acts and those of your wives, which were committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
No one has shown contrition to this day, and no one has shown reverence. You<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “They.”</i> have not followed the Teaching and the laws that I set before you and before your fathers.
Assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: I am going to set My face against you for punishment, to cut off all of Judah.
I will take the remnant of Judah who turned their faces toward the land of Egypt, to go and sojourn there, and they shall be utterly consumed in the land of Egypt. They shall fall by the sword, they shall be consumed by famine; great and small alike shall die by the sword and by famine, and they shall become an execration<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">See note at 24.9; 42.18.</i> and a desolation, a curse<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">See note at 24.9; 42.18.</i> and a mockery.
I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt as I punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence.
Of the remnant of Judah who came to sojourn here in the land of Egypt, no survivor or fugitive shall be left to return to the land of Judah. Though they all long to return and dwell there, none shall return except [a few] survivors.<br>
Thereupon they answered Jeremiah—all the men who knew that their wives made offerings to other gods; all the women present, a large gathering; and all the people who lived in Pathros in the land of Egypt:
“We will not listen to you in the matter about which you spoke to us in the name of the L<small>ORD</small>.
On the contrary, we will do <sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “everything that has gone forth from our mouth.”</i>everything that we have vowed<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup>—to make offerings to the Queen of Heaven and to pour libations to her, as we used to do,<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. 7.18.</i> we and our fathers, our kings and our officials, in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem. For then we had plenty to eat, we were well-off, and suffered no misfortune.
But ever since we stopped making offerings to the Queen of Heaven and pouring libations to her, we have lacked everything, and we have been consumed by the sword and by famine.
And when we make offerings to the Queen of Heaven and pour libations to her, is it without our husbands’ approval that we have made cakes <sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>in her likeness<sup class="endFootnote">-f</sup> and poured libations to her?”
Jeremiah replied to all the people, men and women—all the people who argued with him. He said,
“Indeed, the offerings you presented in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem—you, your fathers, your kings, your officials, and the people of the land—were remembered by the L<small>ORD</small> and brought to mind!
When the L<small>ORD</small> could no longer bear your evil practices and the abominations you committed, your land became a desolate ruin and a curse,<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">See note at 24.9; 42.18.</i> without inhabitant, as is still the case.
Because you burned incense and sinned against the L<small>ORD</small> and did not obey the L<small>ORD</small>, and because you did not follow His Teaching, His laws, and His exhortations, therefore this disaster has befallen you, as is still the case.”
Jeremiah further said to all the people and to all the women: “Hear the word of the L<small>ORD</small>, all Judeans in the land of Egypt!
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: You and your wives have <sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “spoken with your mouth and fulfilled by your hands.”</i>confirmed by deed what you spoke in words:<sup class="endFootnote">-g</sup> ‘We will fulfill the vows which we made, to burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and to pour libations to her.’ So fulfill your vows; perform your vows!
“Yet hear the word of the L<small>ORD</small>, all Judeans who dwell in the land of Egypt! Lo, I swear by My great name—said the L<small>ORD</small>—that none of the men of Judah in all the land of Egypt shall ever again invoke My name, saying, ‘As the Lord G<small>OD</small> lives!’
I will be watchful over them to their hurt, not to their benefit; all the men of Judah in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by sword and by famine, until they cease to be.
Only the few who survive the sword shall return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah. All the remnant of Judah who came to the land of Egypt to sojourn there shall learn whose word will be fulfilled—Mine or theirs!
“And this shall be the sign to you—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—that I am going to deal with you in this place, so that you may know that My threats of punishment against you will be fulfilled:
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: I will deliver Pharaoh Hophra, king of Egypt, into the hands of his enemies, those who seek his life, just as I delivered King Zedekiah of Judah into the hands of King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, his enemy who sought his life.”

Chapter 45

The word which the prophet Jeremiah spoke to Baruch son of Neriah, when he was writing these words in a scroll at Jeremiah’s dictation, in the fourth year of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah:
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of Israel, concerning you, Baruch:
You say, “Woe is me! The L<small>ORD</small> has added grief to my pain. I am worn out with groaning, and I have found no rest.”
Thus shall you speak to him: “Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: I am going to overthrow what I have built, and uproot what I have planted—<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>this applies to the whole land.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>
And do you expect great things for yourself? Don’t expect them.

The word of the L<small>ORD</small> to the prophet Jeremiah concerning the nations.

The word which the L<small>ORD</small> spoke concerning Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, through the prophet Jeremiah:<br>
Declare among the nations, and proclaim;<br>Raise a standard, proclaim;<br>Hide nothing! Say:<br>Babylon is captured,<br>Bel<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Names of the city god of Babylon.</i> is shamed,<br>Merodach<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Names of the city god of Babylon.</i> is dismayed.<br>Her idols are shamed,<br>Her fetishes dismayed.
For a nation from the north has attacked her,<br>It will make her land a desolation.<br>No one shall dwell in it,<br>Both man and beast shall wander away.<br>
In those days and at that time—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—the people of Israel together with the people of Judah shall come, and they shall weep as they go to seek the L<small>ORD</small> their God.
They shall inquire for Zion; in that direction their faces shall turn; <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “come ye.”</i>they shall come<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup> and attach themselves to the L<small>ORD</small> by a covenant for all time, which shall never be forgotten.
My people were lost sheep: their shepherds led them astray, they drove them out to the mountains, they roamed from mount to hill, they forgot their own resting place.
All who encountered them devoured them; and their foes said, “We shall not be held guilty, because they have sinned against the L<small>ORD</small>, the true Pasture, the Hope of their fathers—the L<small>ORD</small>.”<br>
Flee from Babylon,<br>Leave the land of the Chaldeans,<br>And be like he-goats that lead the flock!
For see, I am rousing and leading<br>An assemblage of great nations against Babylon<br>From the lands of the north.<br>They shall draw up their lines against her,<br>There she shall be captured.<br>Their arrows are like those of <sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">So many mss., editions, and versions; other mss. and editions read “a warrior who bereaves.”</i>a skilled warrior<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup><br>Who does not turn back without hitting the mark.
Chaldea shall be despoiled,<br>All her spoilers shall be sated<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
For you rejoiced, you exulted,<br>You who plundered My possession;<br>You stamped like a heifer treading grain,<br>You neighed like steeds.
So your mother will be utterly shamed,<br>She who bore you will be disgraced.<br>Behold the end of the nations—<br>Wilderness, desert, and steppe!
Because of the L<small>ORD</small>’s wrath she shall not be inhabited;<br>She shall be utterly desolate.<br>Whoever passes by Babylon will be appalled<br>And will hiss at all her wounds.<br>
Range yourselves round about Babylon,<br>All you who draw the bow;<br>Shoot at her, don’t spare arrows,<br>For she has sinned against the L<small>ORD</small>.
Raise a shout against her all about!<br><sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “She has given her hand”; meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>She has surrendered;<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup><br>Her bastions have fallen,<br>Her walls are thrown down—<br>This is the L<small>ORD</small>’s vengeance.<br>Take vengeance on her,<br>Do to her as she has done!
Make an end in Babylon of sowers,<br>And of wielders of the sickle at harvest time.<br>Because of the deadly<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> sword,<br>Each man shall turn back to his people,<br>They shall flee every one to his land.<br>
Israel are scattered sheep, harried by lions. First the king of Assyria devoured them, and in the end King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon crunched their bones.
Assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel: I will deal with the king of Babylon and his land as I dealt with the king of Assyria.
And I will lead Israel back to his pasture, and he shall graze in Carmel and Bashan, and eat his fill in the hill country of Ephraim and in Gilead.<br>
In those days and at that time<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>The iniquity of Israel shall be sought,<br>And there shall be none;<br>The sins of Judah,<br>And none shall be found;<br>For I will pardon those I allow to survive.<br>
Advance against her—<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>the land of Merathaim<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup>—<br>And against the inhabitants of Pekod;<br>Ruin and destroy after them to the last<br>—says the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>Do just as I have commanded you.
Hark! War in the land<br>And vast destruction!
How the hammer of the whole earth<br>Has been hacked and shattered!<br>How Babylon has become<br>An appallment among the nations!
I set a snare for you, O Babylon,<br>And you were trapped unawares;<br>You were found and caught,<br>Because you challenged the L<small>ORD</small>.
The L<small>ORD</small> has opened His armory<br>And brought out the weapons of His wrath;<br>For that is the task<br>Of my Lord G<small>OD</small> of Hosts<br>In the land of the Chaldeans.
Come against her <sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>from every quarter;<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup><br>Break open her granaries,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Pile her up like heaps of grain,<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup><br>And destroy her, let her have no remnant!
<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “A sword against”; cf. vv. 35 ff.</i>Destroy all<sup class="endFootnote">-f</sup> her bulls,<br>Let them go down to slaughter.<br>Alas for them, their day is come,<br>The hour of their doom!
Hark! fugitives are escaping<br>From the land of Babylon,<br>To tell in Zion of the vengeance of the L<small>ORD</small> our God,<br>Vengeance for His Temple.<br>
Summon archers against Babylon,<br>All who draw the bow!<br>Encamp against her round about,<br>Let none of her people escape.<br>Pay her back for her actions,<br>Do to her just what she has done;<br>For she has acted insolently against the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>The Holy One of Israel.
Assuredly, her young men shall fall in her squares,<br>And all her warriors shall perish in that day<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
I am going to deal with you, O Insolence<br>—declares the Lord G<small>OD</small> of Hosts—<br>For your day is come, the time when I doom you:
Insolence shall stumble and fall,<br>With none to raise her up.<br>I will set her cities on fire,<br>And it shall consume everything around her.<br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts:<br>The people of Israel are oppressed,<br>And so too the people of Judah;<br>All their captors held them,<br>They refused to let them go.
Their Redeemer is mighty,<br>His name is L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts.<br>He will champion their cause—<br>So as to give rest to the earth,<br>And unrest to the inhabitants of Babylon.<br>
A sword against the Chaldeans<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>And against the inhabitants of Babylon,<br>Against its officials and its wise men!
A sword against the diviners, that they be made fools of!<br>A sword against the warriors, that they be dismayed!
A sword against its horses and chariots,<br>And against all the motley crowd in its midst,<br>That they become like women!<br>A sword against its treasuries, that they be pillaged!
A drought<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Ḥoreb, play on ḥereb, “sword” in preceding verses.</i> against its waters, that they be dried up!<br>For it is a land of idols;<br>They are besotted by their <sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>dread images.<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup>
Assuredly,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Wildcats and hyenas<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup> shall dwell [there],<br>And ostriches shall dwell there;<br>It shall never be settled again,<br>Nor inhabited throughout the ages.<br>
It shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbors—declares the L<small>ORD</small>; no man shall live there, no human shall sojourn there.<br>
Lo, a people comes from the northland;<br>A great nation and many kings are roused<br>From the remotest parts of the earth.
They grasp the bow and javelin,<br>They are cruel, they show no mercy;<br>The sound of them is like the roaring sea.<br>They ride upon horses,<br>Accoutered like a man for battle,<br>Against you, O Fair Babylon!
The king of Babylon has heard the report of them,<br>And his hands are weakened;<br>Anguish seizes him,<br>Pangs like a woman in childbirth.<br>
It shall be as when a lion comes out of the jungle of the Jordan against a secure pasture: in a moment <sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">See note at 49.19.</i>I can harry them out of it and appoint over it anyone I choose.<sup class="endFootnote">-h</sup> Then who is like Me? Who can summon Me? Who is the shepherd that can stand up against Me?
Hear, then, the plan that the L<small>ORD</small> has devised against Babylon, and has purposed against the land of Chaldea:<br>Surely the shepherd boys<br>Shall drag them away;<br>Surely the pasture shall be<br>Aghast because of them.
At the sound of Babylon’s capture<br>The earth quakes,<br>And an outcry is heard among the nations.

Chapter 51

Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>See, I am rousing a destructive wind<br>Against Babylon and the inhabitants of Leb-kamai.<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">A cipher for Kasdim, “Chaldea.”</i>
I will send strangers<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Change of vocalization yields “winnowers.”</i> against Babylon, and they shall winnow her.<br>And they shall strip her land bare;<br>They shall beset her on all sides<br>On the day of disaster.

Let them fall slain in the land of Chaldea,<br>Pierced through in her streets.<br>
For Israel and Judah were not bereft<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “widowed.”</i><br>Of their God the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts,<br>But their land was filled with guilt<br>Before the Holy One of Israel.<br>
Flee from the midst of Babylon<br>And save your lives, each of you!<br>Do not perish for her iniquity;<br>For this is a time of vengeance for the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>He will deal retribution to her.<br>
Babylon was a golden cup in the L<small>ORD</small>’s hand,<br>It made the whole earth drunk;<br>The nations drank of her wine—<br>That is why the nations are mad.
Suddenly Babylon has fallen and is shattered;<br>Howl over her!<br>Get balm for her wounds:<br>Perhaps she can be healed.
We tried to cure Babylon<br>But she was incurable.<br>Let us leave her and go,<br>Each to his own land;<br>For her punishment reaches to heaven,<br>It is as high as the sky.
The L<small>ORD</small> has proclaimed our vindication;<br>Come, let us recount in Zion<br>The deeds of the L<small>ORD</small> our God.<br>
Polish the arrows,<br>Fill the quivers!<br>The L<small>ORD</small> has roused the spirit of the kings of Media,<br>For His plan against Babylon is to destroy her.<br>This is the vengeance of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>Vengeance for His Temple.<br>
Raise a standard against the walls of Babylon!<br>Set up a blockade; station watchmen;<br>Prepare those in ambush.<br>For the L<small>ORD</small> has both planned and performed<br>What He decreed against the inhabitants of Babylon.<br>
O you who dwell by great waters,<br>With vast storehouses,<br>Your time is come, <sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>the hour of your end.<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup>
The L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts has sworn by Himself:<br>I will fill you with men like a locust swarm,<br>They will raise a shout against you.<br>
He made the earth by His might,<br>Established the world by His wisdom,<br>And by His understanding stretched out the skies.
<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “At the sound of His making.”</i>When He makes His voice heard,<sup class="endFootnote">-f</sup><br>There is a rumbling of waters in the skies;<br>He makes vapors rise from the end of the earth,<br>He makes lightning for the rain,<br>And brings forth wind from His treasuries.
Every man is proved dull, without knowledge;<br>Every goldsmith is put to shame because of the idol,<br>For his molten image is a deceit—<br>There is no breath in them.
They are delusion, a work of mockery;<br>In their hour of doom, they shall perish.
Not like these in the Portion of Jacob,<br>For it is He who formed all things;<br>And [Israel is] His very own tribe.<br>L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts is His name.<br>
You are My war club, [My] weapons of battle;<br>With you I clubbed nations,<br>With you I destroyed kingdoms;
With you I clubbed horse and rider,<br>With you I clubbed chariot and driver,
With you I clubbed man and woman,<br>With you I clubbed graybeard and boy,<br>With you I clubbed youth and maiden;
With you I clubbed shepherd and flock,<br>With you I clubbed plowman and team,<br>With you I clubbed governors and prefects.
But I will requite Babylon and all the inhabitants of Chaldea<br>For all the wicked things they did to Zion before your eyes<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
See, I will deal with you, O mountain of the destroyer<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>Destroyer of the whole earth!<br>I will stretch out My hand against you<br>And roll you down from the crags,<br>And make you a burnt-out mountain.
They shall never take from you<br>A cornerstone or foundation stone;<br>You shall be a desolation for all time<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
Raise a standard on earth,<br>Sound a horn among the nations,<br>Appoint nations against her,<br>Assemble kingdoms against her—<br>Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz—<br>Designate a marshal against her,<br>Bring up horses like swarming<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> locusts!
Appoint nations for war against her—<br>The kings of Media,<br>Her governors and all her prefects,<br>And all the lands they rule!<br>
Then the earth quakes and writhes,<br>For the L<small>ORD</small>’s purpose is fulfilled against Babylon,<br>To make the land of Babylon<br>A waste without inhabitant.
The warriors of Babylon stop fighting,<br>They sit in the strongholds,<br>Their might is dried up,<br>They become women.<br>Her dwellings are set afire,<br>Her bars are broken.
Runner dashes to meet runner,<br>Messenger to meet messenger,<br>To report to the king of Babylon<br>That his city is captured, from end to end.
The fords are captured,<br>And the swamp thickets<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> are consumed in fire;<br>And the fighting men are in panic.<br>

Hark! an outcry from Babylon,<br>Great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans.

Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts:<br>Babylon’s broad wall shall be knocked down,<br>And her high gates set afire.<br>Peoples shall labor for naught,<br>And nations have wearied themselves for fire.<br>
The instructions that the prophet Jeremiah gave to Seraiah son of Neriah son of Mahseiah, when the latter went with<sup class="footnote-marker">j</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “at the instance of.”</i> King Zedekiah of Judah to Babylonia, in the fourth year of [Zedekiah’s] reign. Seraiah was quartermaster.<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>
Jeremiah wrote down in one scroll all the disaster that would come upon Babylon, all these things that are written concerning Babylon.
And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “When you get to Babylon, see that you read out all these words.
And say, ‘O L<small>ORD</small>, You Yourself have declared concerning this place that it shall be cut off, without inhabitant, man or beast; that it shall be a desolation for all time.’
And when you finish reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and hurl it into the Euphrates.
And say, ‘Thus shall Babylon sink and never rise again, because of the disaster that I will bring upon it. And [nations] shall have wearied themselves [for fire].’”<sup class="footnote-marker">k</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. v. 58, last line.</i><br><br>Thus far the words of Jeremiah.

Chapter 52

<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">For this chapter cf. chap. 39 above and 2 Kings 24–25.</i>Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother’s name was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
He did what was displeasing to the L<small>ORD</small>, just as Jehoiakim had done.
Indeed, Jerusalem and Judah <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>were a cause of anger for the L<small>ORD</small>, so that<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup> He cast them out of His presence.<br>Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
And in the ninth year of his<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., Zedekiah’s.</i> reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, King Nebuchadrezzar moved against Jerusalem with his whole army. They besieged it and built towers against it all around.
The city continued in a state of siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
By the ninth day of the fourth month, the famine had become acute in the city; there was no food left for the common people.
Then [the wall of] the city was breached. All the soldiers fled; they left the city by night through the gate between the double walls, which is near the king’s garden—the Chaldeans were all around the city—and they set out for the Arabah.<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">See note at 39.4.</i>
But the Chaldean troops pursued the king, and they overtook Zedekiah in the steppes of Jericho, as his entire force left him and scattered.
They captured the king and brought him before the king of Babylon at Riblah, in the region of Hamath; and he put him on trial.
The king of Babylon had Zedekiah’s sons slaughtered before his eyes; he also had all the officials of Judah slaughtered at Riblah.
Then the eyes of Zedekiah were put out, and he was chained in bronze fetters. The king of Babylon brought him to Babylon and put him in prison, [where he remained] to the day of his death.<br>
On the tenth day of the fifth month—that was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon—Nebuzaradan, the chief of the guards, came <sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “he stood before.”</i>to represent<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup> the king of Babylon in Jerusalem.
He burned the House of the L<small>ORD</small>, the king’s palace, and all the houses of Jerusalem; he burned down the house of <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>every notable person.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
The entire Chaldean force that was with the chief of the guards tore down all the walls of Jerusalem on every side.
The remnant of the people left in the city, the defectors who had gone over to the king of Babylon, and what remained of the craftsmen<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Apparently after the deportation of 2 Kings 24.14; meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> were taken into exile by Nebuzaradan, the chief of the guards. But some of the poorest elements of the population—
some of the poorest in the land—were left by Nebuzaradan, the chief of the guards, to be vine-dressers and field hands.
The Chaldeans broke up the bronze columns of the House of the L<small>ORD</small>, the stands, and the bronze tank that was in the House of the L<small>ORD</small>; and they carried all the bronze away to Babylon.
They also took the pails, scrapers, snuffers, sprinkling bowls, ladles, and all the other bronze vessels used in the service.
The chief of the guards took whatever was of gold and whatever was of silver: basins, fire pans, sprinkling bowls, pails, lampstands, ladles, and jars.
The two columns, the one tank and the twelve bronze oxen which supported it, and the stands, which King Solomon had provided for the House of the L<small>ORD</small>—all these objects contained bronze beyond weighing.
As for the columns, each was eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference; it was hollow, and [the metal] was four fingers thick.
It had a bronze capital above it; the height of each capital was five cubits, and there was a meshwork [decorated] with pomegranates about the capital, all made of bronze; and so for the second column, also with pomegranates.
There were ninety-six pomegranates <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>facing outward;<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup> all the pomegranates around the meshwork amounted to one hundred.
The chief of the guards also took Seraiah the chief priest and Zephaniah, the deputy priest, and the three guardians of the threshold.
And from the city he took a eunuch who was in command of the soldiers; seven royal privy councilors, who were present in the city; the scribe of the army commander, who was in charge of mustering the people of the land; and sixty of the common people who were inside the city.
Nebuzaradan, the chief of the guards, took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
The king of Babylon had them struck down and put to death at Riblah, in the region of Hamath.<br><br>Thus Judah was exiled from its land.
This is the number of those whom Nebuchadrezzar exiled in the seventh year: 3,023 Judeans.
In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar, 832 persons [were exiled] from Jerusalem.
And in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadrezzar, Nebuzaradan, the chief of the guards, exiled 745 Judeans. The total amounted to 4,600 persons.<br>
In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of King Jehoiachin of Judah, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, King Evil-merodach of Babylon, in the year he became king, <sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “raised the head of.”</i>took note of<sup class="endFootnote">-g</sup> King Jehoiachin of Judah and released him from prison.
He spoke kindly to him, and gave him a throne above those of other kings who were with him in Babylon.
He removed his prison garments and [Jehoiachin] ate regularly in his presence the rest of his life.
A regular allotment of food was given him by order of the king of Babylon, an allotment for each day, to the day of his death—all the days of his life.
