Zephaniah



Chapter 1

The word of the L<small>ORD</small> that came to Zephaniah son of Cushi son of Gedaliah son of Amariah son of Hezekiah, during the reign of King Josiah son of Amon of Judah.<br>
I will sweep everything away<br>From the face of the earth<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
I will sweep away man and beast;<br>I will sweep away the birds of the sky<br>And the fish of the sea.<br><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>I will make the wicked stumble,<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br>And I will destroy mankind<br>From the face of the earth<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>
I will stretch out My arm against Judah<br>And against all who dwell in Jerusalem;<br>And I will wipe out from this place<br>Every vestige of Baal,<br>And the name of the priestlings<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. kemarim, a term used only of priests of heathen gods.</i> along with the priests;
And those who bow down on the roofs<br>To the host of heaven;<br>And those who bow down and swear to the L<small>ORD</small><br>But also swear by Malcam;<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Apparently identical with “Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites”; cf. 1 Kings 11.5.</i>
And those who have forsaken the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>And those who have not sought the L<small>ORD</small><br>And have not turned to Him.<br>
Be silent before my Lord G<small>OD</small>,<br>For the day of the L<small>ORD</small> is approaching;<br>For the L<small>ORD</small> has prepared a <sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a slaughter of sinners.</i>sacrificial feast,<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup><br>Has bidden His guests purify themselves.
And on the day of the L<small>ORD</small>’s sacrifice<br>I will punish the officials<br>And the king’s sons,<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Apparently brothers of King Amon, who exercised influence during the minority of King Josiah (2 Kings 22.1).</i><br><sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Apparently references to two customs of heathen worship; cf. 2 Kings 10.22 and 1 Sam. 5.5.</i>And all who don a foreign vestment.
I will also punish on that day<br>Everyone who steps over the threshold,<sup class="endFootnote">-f</sup><br>Who fill their master’s<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., King Josiah’s.</i> palace<br>With lawlessness and fraud.
In that day there shall be<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>A loud outcry from the Fish Gate,<br>And howling from the Mishneh,<sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">A quarter of Jerusalem; cf. 2 Kings 22.14.</i><br>And a sound of great anguish from the hills.
The dwellers of the Machtesh<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">Another quarter of Jerusalem.</i> howl;<br>For all the tradesmen have perished,<br>All who weigh silver are wiped out.<br>
At that time,<br>I will search Jerusalem with lamps;<br>And I will punish the men<br>Who rest untroubled on their lees,<br>Who say to themselves,<br>“The L<small>ORD</small> will do nothing, good or bad.”
Their wealth shall be plundered<br>And their homes laid waste.<br>They shall build houses and not dwell in them,<br>Plant vineyards and not drink their wine.
The great day of the L<small>ORD</small> is approaching,<br>Approaching most swiftly.<br><sup class="footnote-marker">j</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields: “The day of the Lord is faster than a runner, / Fleeter than a warrior”; cf. Ps. 19.6.</i>Hark, the day of the L<small>ORD</small>!<br>It is bitter:<br>There a warrior shrieks!<sup class="endFootnote">-j</sup>
That day shall be a day of wrath,<br>A day of trouble and distress,<br>A day of calamity and desolation,<br>A day of darkness and deep gloom,<br>A day of densest clouds,
A day of horn blasts and alarms—<br>Against the fortified towns<br>And the lofty corner towers.
I will bring distress on the people,<br>And they shall walk like blind men,<br>Because they sinned against the L<small>ORD</small>;<br>Their blood shall be spilled like dust,<br>And their fat<sup class="footnote-marker">k</sup><i class="footnote">Or “marrow”; meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> like dung.
Moreover, their silver and gold<br>Shall not avail to save them.<br>On the day of the L<small>ORD</small>’s wrath,<br>In the fire of His passion,<br>The whole land shall be consumed;<br>For He will make a terrible end<br>Of all who dwell in the land.

Chapter 2

Gather together, gather,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain. Emendation yields: “O straw [Aramaic gel] not gathered in, / Before you are driven like flying chaff”; cf. Ps. 35.5.</i>O nation without shame,
Before the day the decree is born—<br>The day flies by like chaff<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>—<br>Before the fierce anger<br>Of the L<small>ORD</small> overtakes you,<br>Before the day of anger<br>Of the L<small>ORD</small> overtakes you.
Seek the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>All you humble of the land<br>Who have fulfilled His law;<br>Seek righteousness,<br>Seek humility.<br>Perhaps you will find shelter<br>On the day of the L<small>ORD</small>’s anger.<br>
Indeed, Gaza shall be deserted<br>And Ashkelon desolate;<br>Ashdod’s people shall be expelled in broad daylight,<br>And Ekron shall be uprooted.
Ah, nation of Cherethites<br>Who inhabit the seacoast!<br>There is a word of the L<small>ORD</small> against you,<br>O Canaan,<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Or “Phoenicia,” of which Philistia is regarded as an extension southward.</i> land of the Philistines:<br>I will lay you waste<br>Without inhabitants.<br>
The seacoast Cheroth<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> shall become<br>An abode for shepherds and folds for flocks,
And shall be a portion for the remnant of the House of Judah;<br>On these [pastures] they shall graze [their flocks],<br>They shall <sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Change of vocalization yields “rest [them]”; cf. Song of Songs 1.7.</i>lie down<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup> at eventide<br>In the houses of Ashkelon.<br>For the L<small>ORD</small> their God will take note of them<br>And restore their fortunes.<br>
I have heard the insults of Moab<br>And the jeers of the Ammonites,<br>Who have insulted My people<br>And gloated over their country.
Assuredly, as I live<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, the God of Israel—<br>Moab shall become like Sodom<br>And the Ammonites like Gomorrah:<br>Clumps<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> of weeds and patches<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> of salt,<br>And desolation evermore.<br>The remnant of My people shall plunder them,<br>The remainder of My nation shall possess them.
That is what they’ll get for their haughtiness,<br>For insulting and jeering<br>At the people of the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts.
The L<small>ORD</small> will show Himself terrible against them,<br>Causing all the gods on earth to shrivel;<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i><br>And all the coastlands of the nations<br>Shall bow down to Him—<br>Every man in his own home.<br>
You Cushites too—<br><sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “shall be slain by the sword of the Lord.”</i>They shall be slain by My sword.<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup>
And He will stretch out His arm against the north<br>And destroy Assyria;<br>He will make Nineveh a desolation,<br>Arid as the desert.
In it flocks shall lie down,<br>Every <sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>species of beast,<br>While jackdaws and owls roost on its capitals,<br>The great owl hoots in the window,<br>And the raven [croaks] on the threshold.<br>For he has stripped its cedarwork bare.<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup><br>
Is this the gay city<br>That dwelt secure,<br>That thought in her heart,<br>“I am, and there is none but me”?<br>Alas, she is become a waste,<br>A lair of wild beasts!<br>Everyone who passes by her<br>Hisses and gestures with his hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">To ward off a like fate from himself; cf. Jer. 18.16 and note.</i>

Chapter 3

Ah, sullied, polluted,<br>Overbearing<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain. Emendation yields “harlot”; cf. Isa. 1.21.</i> city!
She has been disobedient,<br>Has learned no lesson;<br>She has not trusted in the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>Has not drawn near to her God.
The officials within her<br>Are roaring lions;<br>Her judges are wolves <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>of the steppe,<br>They leave no bone until morning.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
Her prophets are reckless,<br>Faithless fellows;<br>Her priests profane what is holy,<br>They give perverse rulings.
But the L<small>ORD</small> in her midst is righteous,<br>He does no wrong;<br>He issues judgment every morning,<br>As unfailing as the light.<br><br>The wrongdoer knows no shame!
I wiped out nations:<br>Their corner towers are desolate;<br>I turned their thoroughfares into ruins,<br>With none passing by;<br>Their towns lie waste without people,<br>Without inhabitants.
And I thought that she<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “you.”</i> would fear Me,<br>Would learn a lesson,<br>And that the punishment I brought on them<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “her.”</i><br>Would not be <sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “cut off [from] her vision.”</i>lost on her.<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup><br>Instead, all the more eagerly<br>They have practiced corruption in all their deeds.<br>
But wait for Me—says the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>For the day when I arise as an accuser;<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Understanding ‘ad as equivalent to ‘ed, with Septuagint and Syriac.</i><br>When I decide to gather nations,<br>To bring kingdoms together,<br>To pour out My indignation on them,<br>All My blazing anger.<br>Indeed, by the fire of My passion<br>All the earth shall be consumed.
For then I will make the peoples pure of speech,<br>So that they all invoke the L<small>ORD</small> by name<br>And serve Him with one accord.<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “back,” i.e., like beasts of burden.</i>
From beyond the rivers of Cush, My suppliants<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i><br>Shall bring offerings to Me in Fair Puzai.<sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “Zion.” For the thought, cf. Isa. 18.1, 7.</i>
In that day,<br>You will no longer be shamed for all the deeds<br>By which you have defied Me.<br>For then I will remove<br>The proud and exultant within you,<br>And you will be haughty no more<br>On My sacred mount.<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in My holy land; cf. Isa. 11.9; 57.13; 65.25.</i>
But I will leave within you<br>A poor, humble folk,<br>And they shall find refuge<br>In the name of the L<small>ORD</small>.
The remnant of Israel<br>Shall do no wrong<br>And speak no falsehood;<br>A deceitful tongue<br>Shall not be in their mouths.<br>Only such as these shall graze and lie down,<br>With none to trouble them.<br>
Shout for joy, Fair Zion,<br>Cry aloud, O Israel!<br>Rejoice and be glad with all your heart,<br>Fair Jerusalem!
The L<small>ORD</small> has annulled the judgment against you,<br>He has swept away your foes.<br>Israel’s Sovereign the L<small>ORD</small> is within you;<br>You need fear misfortune no more.<br>
In that day,<br>This shall be said to Jerusalem:<br>Have no fear, O Zion;<br>Let not your hands droop!
Your God the L<small>ORD</small> is in your midst,<br>A warrior who brings triumph.<br>He will rejoice over you and be glad,<br>He will shout over you with jubilation.<br>He will <sup class="footnote-marker">j</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain. Emendation yields “renew His love / As in the days of old.”</i>soothe with His love
Those long disconsolate.<sup class="endFootnote">-j</sup><br>I will take away from you <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>the woe<br>Over which you endured mockery.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
At that time I will make [an end]<br>Of all who afflicted you.<br>And I will rescue the lame [sheep]<br>And gather the strayed;<br>And I will exchange their disgrace<br>For fame and renown in all the earth.
At that time I will gather you,<br>And at [that] time I will bring you [home];<br>For I will make you renowned and famous<br>Among all the peoples on earth,<br>When I restore your fortunes<br>Before their<sup class="footnote-marker">k</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “your.”</i> very eyes<br>—said the L<small>ORD</small>.
