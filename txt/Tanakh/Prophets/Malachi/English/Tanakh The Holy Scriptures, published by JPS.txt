Malachi



Chapter 1

A pronouncement: The word of the L<small>ORD</small> to Israel through Malachi.<br>
I have shown you love, said the L<small>ORD</small>. But you ask, “How have You shown us love?” After all—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—Esau is Jacob’s brother; yet I have accepted Jacob
and have rejected Esau. I have made his hills a desolation, his territory <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>a home for beasts<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> of the desert.
If Edom thinks, “Though crushed, we can build the ruins again,” thus said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts: They may build, but I will tear down. And so they shall be known as the region of wickedness, the people damned forever of the L<small>ORD</small>.
Your eyes shall behold it, and you shall declare, “Great is the L<small>ORD</small> beyond the borders of Israel!”<br>
A son should honor his father, and a slave<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Septuagint and Targum add “should reverence”; cf. next part of verse.</i> his master. Now if I am a father, where is the honor due Me? And if I am a master, where is the reverence due Me?—said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts to you, O priests who scorn My name. But you ask, “How have we scorned Your name?”
You offer defiled food on My altar. But you ask, “How have we defiled You?”<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Septuagint “it.”</i> By saying, “The table of the L<small>ORD</small> can be treated with scorn.”
When you present a blind animal for sacrifice—it doesn’t matter! When you present a lame or sick one—it doesn’t matter! Just offer it to your governor: Will he accept you? Will he show you favor?—said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts.
And now implore the favor of God! Will He be gracious to us? This is what you have done—will He accept any of you?<br>The L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts has said:
If only you would lock My doors, and not kindle fire on My altar to no purpose! I take no pleasure in you—said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts—and I will accept no offering from you.
For from where the sun rises to where it sets, My name is honored among the nations, and everywhere incense and pure oblation are offered to My name; for My name is honored among the nations—said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts.
But you profane it when you say, “The table of the Lord is defiled and the meat,<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> the food, can be treated with scorn.”
You say, “Oh, what a bother!” And so you degrade<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> it—said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts—and you bring the stolen, the lame, and the sick; and you offer such as an oblation. Will I accept it from you?—said the L<small>ORD</small>.
A curse on the cheat who has an [unblemished] male in his flock, but for his vow sacrifices a blemished animal to the Lord! For I am a great King—said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts—and My name is revered among the nations.

Chapter 2

And now, O priests, this charge is for you:
Unless you obey and unless you lay it to heart, and do honor to My name—said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts—I will send a curse and turn your blessings into curses. (Indeed, I have turned them into curses, because you do not lay it to heart.)
I will <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>put your seed under a ban,<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> and I will strew dung upon your faces, the dung of your festal sacrifices, and you shall be carried out to its [heap].
Know, then, that I have sent this charge to you that My covenant with Levi may endure—said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts.
I had with him a covenant of life and well-being, which I gave to him, and of reverence, which he showed Me. For he stood in awe of My name.
<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">See Hag. 2.10–13; cf. Lev. 10.8–11, Deut. 33.8, 10.</i>Proper rulings were in his mouth,<br>And nothing perverse was on his lips;<br>He served Me with complete loyalty<br>And held the many back from iniquity.
<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Or: For the lips of a priest are observed; / Knowledge and ruling are sought from his mouth.</i>For the lips of a priest guard knowledge,<br>And men seek rulings from his mouth;<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup><br>For he is a messenger of the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts.
But you have turned away from that course: You have made the many stumble through your rulings;<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">By ruling falsely that an act was licit or an object ritually pure.</i> you have corrupted the covenant of the Levites—said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts.
And I, in turn, have made you despicable and vile in the eyes of all the people, because you disregard My ways and show partiality in your rulings.<br>
Have we not all one Father? Did not one God create us? Why do we break faith with one another, profaning the covenant of our ancestors?
Judah has broken faith; abhorrent things have been done in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned what is holy to the L<small>ORD</small>—what He desires—and espoused daughters of alien gods.
May the L<small>ORD</small> leave to him who does this <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>no descendants<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> dwelling in the tents of Jacob and presenting offerings to the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts.
And this you do <sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “a second time”; Septuagint reads “which I detest”; cf. v. 16.</i>as well:<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup> You cover the altar of the L<small>ORD</small> with tears, weeping, and moaning, so that He refuses to regard the oblation any more and to accept <sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “from your hand.”</i>what you offer.<sup class="endFootnote">-f</sup>
But you ask, “Because of what?” Because the L<small>ORD</small> is a witness between you and the wife of your youth with whom you have broken faith, though she is your partner and covenanted spouse.
Did not the One make [all,] <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>so that all remaining life-breath is His? And what does that One seek but godly folk? So be careful of your life-breath,<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> and let no one break faith with the wife of his youth.
For I detest divorce—said the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of Israel—<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>and covering oneself with lawlessness as with a garment<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>—said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts. So be careful of your life-breath and do not act treacherously.<br>
You have wearied the L<small>ORD</small> with your talk. But you ask, “By what have we wearied [Him]?” By saying, “All who do evil are good in the sight of the L<small>ORD</small>, and in them He delights,” or else, “Where is the God of justice?”

Chapter 3

Behold, I am sending My messenger to clear the way before Me, and the Lord whom you seek shall come to His Temple suddenly. As for the angel of the covenant<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Apparently the messenger of the previous sentence is regarded as Israel’s tutelary angel.</i> that you desire, he is already coming.
But who can endure the day of his coming, and who can hold out when he appears? For he is like a smelter’s fire and like fuller’s lye.
He shall act<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “sit.”</i> like a smelter and purger of silver; and he shall purify the descendants of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, so that they shall present offerings in righteousness.
Then the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem shall be pleasing to the L<small>ORD</small> as in the days of yore and in the years of old.
But [first] I will step forward to contend against you, and I will act as a relentless accuser against those who have no fear of Me: Who practice sorcery, who commit adultery, who swear falsely, who cheat laborers of their hire, and who subvert [the cause of] the widow, orphan, and stranger, said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts.<br>
<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Vv. 6–12 resume the thought of 1.2–5.</i>For I am the L<small>ORD</small>—I have not changed; and you are the children of Jacob—you have not ceased to be.
From the very days of your fathers you have turned away from My laws and have not observed them. Turn back to Me, and I will turn back to you—said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts. But you ask, “How shall we turn back?”
Ought man to defraud<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. qaba‘, a play on the name of Jacob (v. 6); cf. Gen. 27.36.</i> God? Yet you are defrauding Me. And you ask, “How have we been defrauding You?” In tithe and contribution.<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the contributions to the priests from the new grain, oil, and wine; see Num. 18.12.</i>
You are suffering under a curse, yet you go on defrauding Me—the whole nation of you.
Bring the full tithe into the storehouse,<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the public storehouse; see Neh. 13.10–13.</i> and let there be food in My House, and thus put Me to the test—said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts. I will surely open the floodgates of the sky for you and pour down blessings on you;
and I will banish the locusts<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “devourer.”</i> from you, so that they will not destroy the yield of your soil; and your vines in the field shall no longer miscarry—said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts.
And all the nations shall account you happy, for you shall be the most desired of lands—said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts.<br>
You have spoken hard words against Me—said the L<small>ORD</small>. But you ask, “What have we been saying among ourselves against You?”
You have said, “It is useless to serve God. What have we gained by keeping His charge and walking in abject awe of the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts?
And so, we account the arrogant happy: they have indeed done evil and endured; they have indeed dared God and escaped.”
In this vein have those who revere the L<small>ORD</small> been talking to one another. The L<small>ORD</small> has heard and noted it, and a scroll of remembrance has been written at His behest concerning those who revere the L<small>ORD</small> and esteem His name.
And on the day that I am preparing, said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts, they shall be My treasured possession; I will be tender toward them as a man is tender toward a son who ministers to him.
And you shall come to see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between him who has served God and him who has not served Him.
For lo! That day is at hand, burning like an oven. All the arrogant and all the doers of evil shall be straw, and the day that is coming—said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts—shall burn them to ashes and leave of them neither stock nor boughs.
But for you who revere My name a sun of victory shall rise <sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “with healing in the folds of its garments”; others “with healing in its wings.”</i>to bring healing.<sup class="endFootnote">-h</sup> You shall go forth and stamp like stall-fed calves,
and you shall trample the wicked to a pulp, for they shall be dust beneath your feet on the day that I am preparing—said the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts.
Be mindful of the Teaching of My servant Moses, whom I charged at Horeb with laws and rules for all Israel.
Lo, I will send the prophet Elijah to you before the coming of the awesome, fearful day of the L<small>ORD</small>.
He shall reconcile parents with children and children with their parents, so that, when I come, I do not strike the whole land with utter destruction.<br><br><small>Lo, I will send the prophet Elijah to you before the coming of the awesome, fearful day of the L<small>ORD</small>.</small>
