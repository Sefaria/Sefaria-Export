Micah



Chapter 1

The word of the L<small>ORD</small> that came to Micah the Morashtite, who prophesied concerning Samaria and Jerusalem in the reigns of Kings Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah.<br>
Listen, all you peoples,<br>Give heed, O earth, and all it holds;<br>And let my Lord G<small>OD</small> be your accuser—<br>My Lord from His holy abode.
For lo! the L<small>ORD</small><br>Is coming forth from His dwelling-place,<br>He will come down and stride<br>Upon the heights of the earth.
The mountains shall melt under Him<br>And the valleys burst open—<br>Like wax before fire,<br>Like water cascading down a slope.<br>
All this is for the transgression of Jacob,<br>And for the sins of the House of Israel.<br>What is the transgression of Jacob<br>But Samaria,<br>And what the shrines<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “sins.”</i> of Judah<br>But Jerusalem?
So I will turn Samaria<br>Into a ruin in open country,<br>Into ground for planting vineyards;<br>For I will tumble her stones into the valley<br>And lay her foundations bare.
All her sculptured images shall be smashed,<br>And all her harlot’s wealth be burned,<br>And I will make a waste heap of all her idols,<br>For they were amassed from fees for harlotry,<br>And they shall become harlots’ fees again.<br>
Because of this I will lament and wail;<br>I will go stripped and naked!<br>I will lament as sadly as the jackals,<br>As mournfully as the ostriches.
For her<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the nation’s.</i> wound is incurable,<br>It has reached Judah,<br>It has spread to the gate of my people,<br>To Jerusalem.<br>
<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of much of vv. 10–13 uncertain. They may refer to the transfer of part of western Judah to Philistine rule by Sennacherib of Assyria in the year 701 b.c.e.</i>Tell it not in Gath,<br>Refrain from weeping;<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">So that enemies may not gloat; cf. 2 Sam. 1.20.</i><br>In Beth-leaphrah,<br>Strew dust<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. ‘aphar, a play on Beth-leaphrah; vv. 10–15 contain several similar puns.</i> over your [head].
Pass on, inhabitants of Shaphir!<br>Did not the inhabitants of Zaanan<br>Have to go forth naked in shame?<br>There is lamentation in Beth-ezel—<br>It will withdraw its support from you.
Though the inhabitants of Maroth<br>Hoped for good,<br>Yet disaster from the L<small>ORD</small> descended<br>Upon the gate of Jerusalem.
Hitch the steeds to the chariot,<br>Inhabitant of Lachish!<br>It is the beginning<br>Of Fair Zion’s guilt;<br>Israel’s transgressions<br>Can be traced to you!
Truly, you must give a farewell gift<br>To Moresheth-gath.<br><sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “Fair Achzib is.”</i>The houses of Achzib are<sup class="endFootnote">-f</sup><br>To the kings of Israel<br>Like a spring that fails.
A dispossessor will I bring to you<br>Who dwell in Mareshah;<br>At Adullam the glory<br>Of Israel shall set.
<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">A common rite of mourning; cf. Jer. 7.29.</i>Shear off your hair and make yourself bald<br>For the children you once delighted in;<br>Make yourself as bald as a vulture,<br>For they have been banished from you.

Chapter 2

Ah, those who plan iniquity<br>And design evil on their beds;<br>When morning dawns, they do it,<br>For they have the power.
They covet fields, and seize them;<br>Houses, and take them away.<br>They defraud men of their homes,<br>And people of their land.
Assuredly, thus said the L<small>ORD</small>: I am planning such a misfortune against this clan that you will not be able to free your necks from it. You will not be able to walk erect; it will be such a time of disaster.
In that day,<br>One shall recite a poem about you,<br>And utter a bitter lament,<br>And shall say:<br><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>“My people’s portion changes hands;<br>How it slips away from me!<br>Our field is allotted to a rebel.<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “ravager.”</i><br>We are utterly ravaged.”<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>
Truly, none of you<br>Shall cast a lot cord<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">On a piece of land, thus acquiring title to it; cf. Josh. 18.6 and Ps. 16.6.</i><br>In the assembly of the L<small>ORD</small>!<br>
“Stop preaching!” they preach.<br>“That’s no way to preach;<br><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Shame shall not overtake [us].
Is the House of Jacob condemned?<sup>a</sup><br>Is the L<small>ORD</small>’s patience short?<br>Is such His practice?”<br><br>To be sure, My words are friendly<br>To those who walk in rectitude;
But <sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain; emendation yields “you arise as enemies against.”</i>an enemy arises against<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup> My people.<br>You strip the mantle <sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain; emendation yields “off peaceful folk.”</i>with the cloak<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup><br>Off such as pass unsuspecting,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Who are turned away from war.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>
You drive the women of My people away<br>From their pleasant homes;<br>You deprive their infants<br>Of My glory forever.
Up and depart!<br>This is no resting place<br><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Because of [your] defilement.<br>Terrible destruction shall befall.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br>
If a man were to go about uttering<br>Windy, baseless falsehoods:<br>“I’ll preach to you in favor of wine and liquor”—<br>He would be a preacher [acceptable] to that people.<br>
<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Vv. 12–13 may be an example of such “acceptable” preaching.</i>I will assemble Jacob, all of you;<br>I will bring together the remnant of Israel;<br>I will make them all like sheep <sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “in a fold [Arabic s™†rah].”</i>of Bozrah,<sup class="endFootnote">-g</sup><br>Like a flock inside its pen<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>—<br>They will be noisy with people.
One who makes a breach<br>Goes before them;<br>They enlarge it to a gate<br>And leave by it.<br>Their king marches before them,<br>The L<small>ORD</small> at their head.

Chapter 3

I said:<br>Listen, you rulers of Jacob,<br>You chiefs of the House of Israel!<br>For you ought to know what is right,
<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Syntax of vv. 2–3 uncertain.</i>But you hate good and love evil.
You have devoured My people’s flesh;<br>You have flayed the skin off them,<br>And their flesh off their bones.<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Brought down from v. 2 for clarity.</i>And after tearing their skins off them,<br>And their flesh off their bones,<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>And breaking their bones to bits,<br>You have cut it up <sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain; Septuagint and Syriac read “like flesh in.”</i>as into<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup> a pot,<br>Like meat in a caldron.
Someday they shall cry out to the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>But He will not answer them;<br>At that time He will hide His face from them,<br>In accordance with the wrongs they have done.<br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small> to the prophets<br>Who lead My people astray,<br>Who cry “Peace!”<br>When they have something to chew,<br>But launch a war on him<br>Who fails to fill their mouths:
Assuredly,<br>It shall be night for you<br>So that you cannot prophesy,<br>And it shall be dark for you<br>So that you cannot divine;<br>The sun shall set on the prophets,<br>And the day shall be darkened for them.
The seers shall be shamed<br>And the diviners confounded;<br>They shall cover their upper lips,<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">As a sign of mourning; cf. Ezek. 24.17, 22; Lev. 13.45.</i><br>Because no response comes from God.
But I,<br>I am filled with strength by the spirit of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>And with judgment and courage,<br>To declare to Jacob his transgressions<br>And to Israel his sin.<br>
Hear this, you rulers of the House of Jacob,<br>You chiefs of the House of Israel,<br>Who detest justice<br>And make crooked all that is straight,
Who build Zion with crime,<br>Jerusalem with iniquity!
Her rulers judge for gifts,<br>Her priests give rulings for a fee,<br>And her prophets divine for pay;<br>Yet they rely upon the L<small>ORD</small>, saying,<br>“The L<small>ORD</small> is in our midst;<br>No calamity shall overtake us.”
Assuredly, because of you<br>Zion shall be plowed as a field,<br>And Jerusalem shall become heaps of ruins,<br>And the Temple Mount<br>A shrine in the woods.

Chapter 4

<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">For vv. 1–3 cf. Isa. 2.2–4.</i>In the days to come,<br>The Mount of the L<small>ORD</small>’s House shall stand<br>Firm above the mountains;<br>And it shall tower above the hills.<br>The peoples shall gaze on it with joy,
And the many nations shall go and shall say:<br>“Come,<br>Let us go up to the Mount of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>To the House of the God of Jacob;<br>That He may instruct us in His ways,<br>And that we may walk in His paths.”<br>For instruction shall come forth<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., oracles will be obtainable.</i> from Zion,<br>The word of the L<small>ORD</small> from Jerusalem.
Thus He will judge among the many peoples,<br>And arbitrate for the multitude of nations,<br>However distant;<br>And they shall beat their swords into plowshares<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">More exactly, the iron points with which wooden plows were tipped.</i><br>And their spears into pruning hooks.<br>Nation shall not take up<br>Sword against nation;<br>They shall never again know<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Judg. 3.2.</i> war;
But every man shall sit<br>Under his grapevine or fig tree<br>With no one to disturb him.<br>For it was the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts who spoke.
Though all the peoples walk<br>Each in the names of its gods,<br>We will walk<br>In the name of the L<small>ORD</small> our God<br>Forever and ever.<br>
In that day<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>I will assemble the lame [sheep]<br>And will gather the outcast<br>And those I have treated harshly;
And I will turn the lame into a remnant<br>And the expelled<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain; emendation yields “weaklings”; cf. Ezek. 34.4.</i> into a populous nation.<br>And the L<small>ORD</small> will reign over them on Mount Zion<br>Now and for evermore.<br>
And you, O Migdal-eder,<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Apparently near Bethlehem; see Gen. 35.19–21.</i><br><sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Outpost of Fair Zion,<br>It shall come to you:<sup class="endFootnote">-g</sup><br>The former monarchy shall return—<br>The kingship of <sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “the House of Israel”; cf. 5.1–2.</i>Fair Jerusalem.<sup class="endFootnote">-h</sup><br>
Now why do you utter such cries?<br>Is there no king in you,<br>Have your advisors perished,<br>That you have been seized by writhing<br>Like a woman in travail?
Writhe and scream,<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> Fair Zion,<br>Like a woman in travail!<br>For now you must leave the city<br>And dwell in the country—<br>And you will reach Babylon.<br>There you shall be saved,<br>There the L<small>ORD</small> will redeem you<br>From the hands of your foes.
Indeed, many nations<br>Have assembled against you<br>Who think, “Let our eye<br><sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Obscenely gaze<sup class="endFootnote">-g</sup> on Zion.”
But they do not know<br>The design of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>They do not divine His intent:<br>He has gathered them<br>Like cut grain to the threshing floor.
Up and thresh, Fair Zion!<br>For I will give you horns of iron<br>And provide you with hoofs of bronze,<br>And you will crush the many peoples.<br>You<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. -ti serves here as the ending of the second-person singular feminine; cf. Judg. 5.7 and note; Jer. 2.20; etc.</i> will devote their riches to the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>Their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.<br>
Now you gash yourself <sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>in grief.<sup class="endFootnote">-g</sup><br>They have laid siege to us;<br>They strike the ruler of Israel<br>On the cheek with a staff.

Chapter 5

And you, O Bethlehem of Ephrath,<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">The clan to which the Bethlehemites belonged; see 1 Sam. 17.12; Ruth 1.2; 4.11.</i><br>Least among the clans of Judah,<br>From you one shall come forth<br>To rule Israel for Me—<br>One whose origin is from of old,<br>From ancient times.
<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Truly, He will leave them [helpless]<br>Until she who is to bear has borne;<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a ruler, shepherd (v. 3), to deliver Israel from the Assyrians (vv. 4–5).</i><br>Then the rest of his countrymen<br>Shall return to the children of Israel.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
He shall stand and shepherd<br>By the might of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>By the power of the name<br>Of the L<small>ORD</small> his God,<br>And they shall dwell [secure].<br>For lo, he shall wax great<br>To the ends of the earth;
And that shall afford safety.<br>Should Assyria invade our land<br>And tread upon our fortresses,<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Septuagint and Syriac read “soil”; cf. v. 5.</i><br>We will set up over it<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., Assyria.</i> seven shepherds,<br>Eight princes of men,
Who will shepherd Assyria’s land with swords,<br>The land of Nimrod <sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “with drawn blades”; cf. Ps. 37.14; 55.22.</i>in its gates.<sup class="endFootnote">-f</sup><br>Thus he will deliver [us]<br>From Assyria, should it invade our land,<br>And should it trample our country.<br>
The remnant of Jacob shall be,<br>In the midst of the many peoples,<br>Like dew from the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>Like droplets on grass—<br>Which do not look to any man<br>Nor place their hope in mortals.<br>
The remnant of Jacob<br>Shall be among the nations,<br>In the midst of the many peoples,<br>Like a lion among beasts of the wild,<br>Like a fierce lion among flocks of sheep,<br>Which tramples wherever it goes<br>And rends, with none to deliver.
Your hand shall prevail over your foes,<br>And all your enemies shall be cut down!
In that day<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>I will destroy the horses in your midst<br>And wreck your chariots.
I will destroy the cities of your land<br>And demolish all your fortresses.
I will destroy the sorcery you practice,<br>And you shall have no more soothsayers.
I will destroy your idols<br>And the sacred pillars in your midst;<br>And no more shall you bow down<br>To the work of your hands.
I will tear down the sacred posts in your midst<br>And destroy your cities.<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “idols.”</i>
In anger and wrath<br>Will I wreak retribution<br>On the nations<sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “arrogant.”</i> that have not obeyed.

Chapter 6

Hear what the L<small>ORD</small> is saying:<br>Come, present [My] case before the mountains,<br>And let the hills hear you pleading.<br>
Hear, you mountains, the case of the L<small>ORD</small>—<br><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “Give ear, you.”</i>You firm<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> foundations of the earth!<br>For the L<small>ORD</small> has a case against His people,<br>He has a suit against Israel.<br>
“My people!<br>What wrong have I done you?<br>What hardship have I caused you?<br>Testify against Me.
In fact,<br>I brought you up from the land of Egypt,<br>I redeemed you from the house of bondage,<br>And I sent before you<br>Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.<br>
“My people,<br>Remember what Balak king of Moab<br>Plotted against you,<br>And how Balaam son of Beor<br>Responded to him.<br>[Recall your passage]<br>From Shittim to Gilgal<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the crossing of the Jordan; see Josh. 3.1, 14–4.19.</i>—<br>And you will recognize<br>The gracious acts of the L<small>ORD</small>.”<br>
With what shall I approach the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>Do homage to God on high?<br>Shall I approach Him with burnt offerings,<br>With calves a year old?
Would the L<small>ORD</small> be pleased with thousands of rams,<br>With myriads of streams of oil?<br>Shall I give my first-born for my transgression,<br>The fruit of my body for my sins?<br>
“He has told you, O man, what is good,<br>And what the L<small>ORD</small> requires of you:<br>Only to do justice<br>And to love goodness,<br>And <sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Or “It is prudent to serve your God.”</i>to walk modestly with your God;<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup>
<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “And it is worthwhile to revere His name.”</i>Then will your name achieve wisdom.”<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup><br><br>Hark! The L<small>ORD</small><br>Summons the city:<br><sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Hear, O scepter;<br>For who can direct her

Shall he<sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “I”; change of vocalization yields “Will I acquit him.”</i> be acquitted despite wicked balances<br>And a bag of fraudulent weights?—
<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">This verse would read well after “city” in v. 9.</i>Whose rich men are full of lawlessness,<br>And whose inhabitants speak treachery,<br>With tongues of deceit in their mouths.<br>
I, in turn, have beaten you sore,<br>Have stunned [you] for your sins:
You have been eating without getting your fill,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>And there is a gnawing at your vitals;<br>You have been conceiving without bearing young,<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup><br>And what you bore I would deliver to the sword.
You have been sowing, but have nothing to reap;<br>You have trod olives, but have no oil for rubbing,<br>And grapes<sup class="footnote-marker">j</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “new wine.”</i> but have no wine to drink.
Yet <sup class="footnote-marker">k</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “is kept.”</i>you have kept<sup class="endFootnote">-k</sup> the laws of Omri,<br>And all the practices of the House of Ahab,<br>And have followed what they devised.<br>Therefore I will make you an object of horror<br>And <sup class="footnote-marker">l</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., those of the city of v. 9, apparently Samaria.</i>her inhabitants<sup class="endFootnote">-l</sup> an object of hissing;<sup class="footnote-marker">m</sup><i class="footnote">See note at Jer. 18.16.</i><br>And you shall bear the mockery of peoples.<sup class="footnote-marker">n</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “My people.”</i>

Chapter 7

Woe is me!<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">The speaker is feminine (cf. ’elohayikh, v. 10), probably Samaria personified; cf. note l-l at 6.16.</i><br>I am become like leavings of a fig harvest,<br>Like gleanings when the vintage is over,<br>There is not a cluster to eat,<br>Not a ripe fig I could desire.
The pious are vanished from the land,<br>None upright are left among men;<br>All lie in wait to commit crimes,<br>One traps the other in his net.
<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>They are eager to do evil:<br>The magistrate makes demands,<br>And the judge [judges] for a fee;<br>The rich man makes his crooked plea,<br>And they grant it.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>

Trust no friend,<br>Rely on no intimate;<br>Be guarded in speech<br>With her who lies in your bosom.
For son spurns father,<br>Daughter rises up against mother,<br>Daughter-in-law against mother-in-law—<br>A man’s own household<br>Are his enemies.
Yet I will look to the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>I will wait for the God who saves me,<br>My God will hear me.<br>
Do not rejoice over me,<br>O my enemy!<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. feminine, apparently referring to Damascus.</i><br>Though I have fallen, I rise again;<br>Though I sit in darkness, the L<small>ORD</small> is my light.
I must bear the anger of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>Since I have sinned against Him,<br>Until He champions my cause<br>And upholds my claim.<br>He will let me out into the light;<br>I will enjoy vindication by Him.
When my enemy<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. feminine, apparently referring to Damascus.</i> sees it,<br>She shall be covered with shame,<br>She who taunts me with “Where is He,<br>The L<small>ORD</small> your God?”<br>My eyes shall behold her [downfall];<br>Lo, she shall be for trampling<br>Like mud in the streets.
A day for mending your walls<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">To keep out tramplers (end of preceding verse); cf. Isa. 5.5; Ps. 80.13–14.</i>—<br>That is a far-off day.
This is rather a day when to you<br>[Tramplers] will come streaming<br>From Assyria and the towns of Egypt—<br>From [every land from] Egypt to the Euphrates,<br>From sea to sea and from mountain to mountain—
And your<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “the.”</i> land shall become a desolation—<br>Because of those who dwell in it—<br>As the fruit of their misdeeds.<br>

Who is a God like You,<br>Forgiving iniquity<br>And remitting transgression;<br>Who has not maintained His wrath forever<br>Against the remnant of His own people,<br>Because He loves graciousness!
He will take us back in love;<br>He will cover up our iniquities,<br>You will hurl all our<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “their.”</i> sins<br>Into the depths of the sea.
You will keep faith with Jacob,<br>Loyalty to Abraham,<br>As You promised on oath to our fathers<br>In days gone by.
