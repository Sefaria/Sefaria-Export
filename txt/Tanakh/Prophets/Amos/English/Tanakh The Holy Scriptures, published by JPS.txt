Amos



Chapter 1

The words of Amos, a sheepbreeder from Tekoa, who prophesied concerning Israel in the reigns of Kings Uzziah of Judah and Jeroboam son of Joash of Israel, two years before the earthquake.<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">See Zech. 14.5.</i><br>
He proclaimed:<br>The L<small>ORD</small> roars from Zion,<br>Shouts aloud from Jerusalem;<br>And the pastures of the shepherds shall languish,<br>And the summit of Carmel shall wither.<br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>For three transgressions of Damascus,<br>For four, I will not revoke it:<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">I.e, the decree of punishment.</i><br>Because they threshed Gilead<br>With threshing boards of iron.
I will send down<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Lam. 1.13.</i> fire upon the palace of Hazael,<br>And it shall devour the fortresses of Ben-hadad.<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. 2 Kings 13.22–25.</i>
I will break the gate bars of Damascus,<br>And wipe out the inhabitants from the Vale of Aven<br>And the sceptered ruler of Beth-eden;<br>And the people of Aram shall be exiled to Kir<br>—said the L<small>ORD</small>.
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>For three transgressions of Gaza,<br>For four, I will not revoke it:<br>Because they exiled<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they cooperated in the annexation of Israelite territory; cf. Jer. 13.19 with note.</i> an entire population,<br>Which they delivered to Edom.<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “Aram”; cf. Isa. 9.11.</i>
I will send down fire upon the wall of Gaza,<br>And it shall devour its fortresses;
And I will wipe out the inhabitants of Ashdod<br>And the sceptered ruler of Ashkelon;<br>And I will turn My hand against Ekron,<br>And the Philistines shall perish to the last man<br>—said the Lord G<small>OD</small>.
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>For three transgressions of Tyre,<br>For four, I will not revoke it:<br>Because they handed over<br>An entire population to Edom,<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “Aram.”</i><br>Ignoring the covenant of brotherhood.<sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. 1 Kings 5.26; 9.12–13.</i>
I will send down fire upon the wall of Tyre,<br>And it shall devour its fortresses.<br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>For three transgressions of Edom,<br>For four, I will not revoke it:<br>Because he pursued his brother with the sword<br>And repressed all pity,<br>Because his anger raged unceasing<br>And his fury stormed<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Akkadian shamaru and Jer. 3.5.</i> unchecked.
I will send down fire upon Teman,<br>And it shall devour the fortresses of Bozrah.<br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>For three transgressions of the Ammonites,<br>For four, I will not revoke it:<br>Because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead<br>In order to enlarge their own territory.
I will set fire to the wall of Rabbah,<br>And it shall devour its fortresses,<br>Amid shouting on a day of battle,<br>On a day of violent tempest.
Their king and his officers shall go<br>Into exile together<br>—said the L<small>ORD</small>.

Chapter 2

Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>For three transgressions of Moab,<br>For four, I will not revoke it:<br>Because he burned the bones<br>Of the king of Edom to lime.
I will send down fire upon Moab,<br>And it shall devour the fortresses of Kerioth.<br>And Moab shall die in tumult,<br>Amid shouting and the blare of horns;
I will wipe out the ruler from within her<br>And slay all her officials along with him<br>—said the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>For three transgressions of Judah,<br>For four, I will not revoke it:<br>Because they have spurned the Teaching of the L<small>ORD</small><br>And have not observed His laws;<br>They are beguiled by the delusions<br>After which their fathers walked.
I will send down fire upon Judah,<br>And it shall devour the fortresses of Jerusalem.<br>
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>For three transgressions of Israel,<br>For four, I will not revoke it:<br>Because they have sold for silver<br>Those whose cause was just,<br>And the needy for a pair of sandals.
[Ah,] you <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Understanding sho’afim as equivalent to shafim. Emendation yields: “Who crush on the ground / The heads of the poor, / And push off the road / The humble of the land”; cf. Job 24.4.</i>who trample the heads of the poor<br>Into the dust of the ground,<br>And make the humble walk a twisted course!<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br>Father and son go to the same girl,<br>And thereby profane My holy name.
They recline by every altar<br>On garments taken in pledge,<br>And drink in the House of their God<br>Wine bought with fines they imposed.
Yet I<br>Destroyed the Amorite before them,<br>Whose stature was like the cedar’s<br>And who was stout as the oak,<br>Destroying his boughs above<br>And his trunk below!
And I<br>Brought you up from the land of Egypt<br>And led you through the wilderness forty years,<br>To possess the land of the Amorite!
And I raised up prophets from among your sons<br>And nazirites from among your young men.<br>Is that not so, O people of Israel?<br>—says the L<small>ORD</small>.
But you made the nazirites drink wine<br>And ordered the prophets not to prophesy.
<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of verse uncertain; alternatively: “I will slow your movements / As a threshing sledge (cf. Isa. 28.27–28) is slowed / When clogged by cut grain.”</i>Ah, I will slow your movements<br>As a wagon is slowed<br>When it is full of cut grain.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
Flight shall fail the swift,<br>The strong shall find no strength,<br>And the warrior shall not save his life.
The bowman shall not hold his ground,<br>And the fleet-footed shall not escape,<br>Nor the horseman save his life.
Even the most stouthearted warrior<br>Shall run away unarmed<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “naked.”</i> that day<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.

Chapter 3

Hear this word, O people of Israel,<br>That the L<small>ORD</small> has spoken concerning you,<br>Concerning the whole family that I brought up from the land of Egypt:
You alone have I singled out<br>Of all the families of the earth—<br>That is why I will call you to account<br>For all your iniquities.<br>
Can two walk together<br>Without having met?
Does a lion roar in the forest<br>When he has no prey?<br>Does a great beast let out a cry from its den<br>Without having made a capture?
Does a bird drop on the ground—in a trap—<br>With no snare there?<br>Does a trap spring up from the ground<br>Unless it has caught something?
When a ram’s horn is sounded in a town,<br>Do the people not take alarm?<br>Can misfortune come to a town<br>If the L<small>ORD</small> has not caused it?
Indeed, my Lord G<small>OD</small> does nothing<br>Without having revealed His purpose<br>To His servants the prophets.
A lion has roared,<br>Who can but fear?<br>My Lord G<small>OD</small> has spoken,<br>Who can but prophesy?
Proclaim in the fortresses of Ashdod<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Septuagint reads “Assyria.”</i><br>And in the fortresses of the land of Egypt!<br>Say:<br>Gather on the hill<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. plural; but cf. 4.1; 6.1.</i> of Samaria<br>And witness the great outrages within her<br>And the oppression in her midst.
They are incapable of doing right<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>;<br>They store up lawlessness and rapine<br>In their fortresses.
Assuredly,<br>Thus said my Lord G<small>OD</small>:<br>An enemy, all about the land!<br>He shall strip you of your splendor,<br>And your fortresses shall be plundered.
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>:<br>As a shepherd rescues from the lion’s jaws<br>Two shank bones or the tip of an ear,<br>So shall the Israelites escape<br>Who dwell in Samaria—<br>With the leg<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> of a bed or the head<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> of a couch.<br>
Hear [this], and warn the House of Jacob<br>—says my Lord G<small>OD</small>, the God of Hosts—
That when I punish Israel for its transgressions,<br>I will wreak judgment on the altar<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. plural, but cf. “altar” in next line.</i> of Bethel,<br>And the horns of the altar shall be cut off<br>And shall fall to the ground.
I will wreck the winter palace<br>Together with the summer palace;<br>The ivory palaces shall be demolished,<br>And the great houses shall be destroyed<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.

Chapter 4

Hear this word, you cows of Bashan<br>On the hill of Samaria—<br>Who defraud the poor,<br>Who rob the needy;<br>Who say to your<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. “their.”</i> husbands,<br>“Bring, and let’s carouse!”
My Lord G<small>OD</small> swears by His holiness:<br>Behold, days are coming upon you<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>When you will be carried off in baskets,<br>And, to the last one, in fish baskets,
And taken out [of the city]—<br>Each one through a breach straight ahead—<br>And flung on the refuse heap<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
Come to Bethel and transgress;<br>To Gilgal, and transgress even more:<br>Present your sacrifices the next morning<br>And your tithes on the third day;
And burn a thank offering of leavened bread;<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Lev. 7.12–14; where, however, the bread is not to be burned.</i><br>And proclaim freewill offerings loudly.<br>For you love that sort of thing, O Israelites<br>—declares my Lord G<small>OD</small>.
I, on My part, have given you<br>Cleanness of teeth in all your towns,<br>And lack of food in all your settlements.<br>Yet you did not turn back to Me<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
I therefore withheld the rain from you<br>Three months before harvesttime:<br>I would make it rain on one town<br>And not on another;<br>One field would be rained upon<br>While another on which it did not rain<br>Would wither.
So two or three towns would wander<br>To a single town to drink water,<br>But their thirst would not be slaked.<br>Yet you did not turn back to Me<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
I scourged you with blight and mildew;<br>Repeatedly<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> your gardens and vineyards,<br>Your fig trees and olive trees<br>Were devoured by locusts.<br>Yet you did not turn back to Me<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
I sent against you pestilence<br>In the manner of Egypt;<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Alluding to the plagues at the time of the Exodus.</i><br>I slew your young men with the sword,<br>Together with your captured horses,<br>And I made the stench of your armies<br>Rise in your very nostrils.<br>Yet you did not turn back to Me<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>
I have wrought destruction among you<br>As when God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah;<br>You have become like a brand plucked from burning.<br>Yet you have not turned back to Me<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
Assuredly,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “Because you are acting thus toward Me.”</i>Because I am doing that to you,<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup><br>Even so will I act toward you, O Israel—<br>Prepare to meet your God, O Israel!<br>
Behold,<br>He who formed the mountains,<br>And created the wind,<br>And has told man what His wish<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> is,<br>Who turns blackness<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Joel 2.2. Emendation yields “darkness”; cf. 5.8.</i> into daybreak,<br>And treads upon the high places of the earth—<br>His name is the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of Hosts.

Chapter 5

Hear this word which I intone<br>As a dirge over you, O House of Israel:
Fallen, not to rise again,<br>Is Maiden Israel;<br>Abandoned on her soil<br>With none to lift her up.
For thus said my Lord G<small>OD</small><br>About the House of Israel:<br>The town that marches out a thousand strong<br>Shall have a hundred left,<br>And the one that marches out a hundred strong<br>Shall have but ten left.
Thus said the L<small>ORD</small><br>To the House of Israel:<br>Seek Me, and you will live.
Do not seek Bethel,<br>Nor go to Gilgal,<br>Nor cross over<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., into Judah; cf. 1 Kings 19.3.</i> to Beer-sheba;<br>For Gilgal shall go into exile,<br>And Bethel shall become a delusion.
Seek the L<small>ORD</small>, and you will live,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Else He will rush like fire upon<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup> the House of Joseph<br>And consume Bethel<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Septuagint reads “the House of Israel.”</i> with none to quench it.<br>
[Ah,] you who turn justice into wormwood<br>And hurl righteousness to the ground!<br>[Seek the L<small>ORD</small>,]
Who made the Pleiades and Orion,<br>Who turns deep darkness into dawn<br>And darkens day into night,<br>Who summons the waters of the sea<br>And pours them out upon the earth—<br>His name is the L<small>ORD</small>!
<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>It is He who hurls destruction upon strongholds,<br>So that ruin comes upon fortresses!<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>
They hate the arbiter in the gate,<br>And detest him whose plea is just.
Assuredly,<br>Because you <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>impose a tax<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup> on the poor<br>And exact from him a levy of grain,<br>You have built houses of hewn stone,<br>But you shall not live in them;<br>You have planted delightful vineyards,<br>But shall not drink their wine.
For I have noted how many are your crimes,<br>And how countless your sins—<br>You enemies of the righteous,<br>You takers of bribes,<br>You who subvert in the gate<br>The cause of the needy!<br>
Assuredly,<br>At such a time the prudent man keeps silent,<br>For it is an evil time.<br>
Seek good and not evil,<br>That you may live,<br>And that the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of Hosts,<br>May truly be with you,<br>As you think.
Hate evil and love good,<br>And establish justice in the gate;<br>Perhaps the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of Hosts,<br>Will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.<br>
Assuredly,<br>Thus said the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>My Lord, the God of Hosts:<br>In every square there shall be lamenting,<br>In every street cries of “Ah, woe!”<br>And the farm hand shall be<br>Called to mourn,<br>And those skilled in wailing<br>To lament;
For there shall be lamenting<br>In every vineyard, too,<br>When I pass through your midst<br>—said the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>
Ah, you who wish<br>For the day of the L<small>ORD</small>!<br>Why should you want<br>The day of the L<small>ORD</small>?<br>It shall be darkness, not light!
—As if a man should run from a lion<br>And be attacked by a bear;<br>Or if he got indoors,<br>Should lean his hand on the wall<br>And be bitten by a snake!
Surely the day of the L<small>ORD</small> shall be<br>Not light, but darkness,<br>Blackest night without a glimmer.<br>
I loathe, I spurn your festivals,<br>I am not appeased by your solemn assemblies.
If you offer Me burnt offerings—or your meal offerings—<br>I will not accept them;<br>I will pay no heed<br>To your gifts of fatlings.
Spare Me the sound of your hymns,<br>And let Me not hear the music of your lutes.
But let justice well up like water,<br>Righteousness like an unfailing stream.
Did you offer sacrifice and oblation to Me<br>Those forty years in the wilderness,<br>O House of Israel?<br>
<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Vv. 26–27 would read well after 6.14.</i>And you shall carry off your “king”—<br>Sikkuth<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Two Akkadian names applied to Saturn, here deliberately pointed with the vowels of Heb. shiqquṣ, “detestable thing.”</i> and Kiyyun,<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Two Akkadian names applied to Saturn, here deliberately pointed with the vowels of Heb. shiqquṣ, “detestable thing.”</i><br>The images you have made for yourselves<br>Of your astral deity—
As I drive you into exile beyond Damascus<br>—Said the L<small>ORD</small>, whose name is God of Hosts.<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., who is Lord of all the astral bodies.</i>

Chapter 6

Ah, you who are at ease in Zion<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “Joseph,” cf. v. 6, and 5.6, 15, where “Joseph” denotes the northern kingdom.</i><br>And confident on the hill of Samaria,<br>You notables of the leading nation<br>On whom the House of Israel <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Taking ba’ l-as synonymous with ba’ ‘ad; see Isa. 45.24 and note i-i.</i>pin their hopes:<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
Cross over to Calneh and see,<br>Go from there to Great Hamath,<br>And go down to Gath of the Philistines:<br>Are [you] better than those kingdoms,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “Or is your territory larger than theirs?”</i>Or is their territory larger than yours?<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup>
<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Yet you ward off [the thought of] a day of woe<br>And convene a session of lawlessness.<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup>
They lie on ivory beds,<br>Lolling on their couches,<br>Feasting on lambs from the flock<br>And on calves from the stalls.
<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>They hum snatches of song<br>To the tune of the lute—<br>They account themselves musicians<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup> like David.
They drink [straight] from the wine bowls<br>And anoint themselves with the choicest oils—<br>But they are not concerned about the ruin of Joseph.
Assuredly, right soon<br>They shall head the column of exiles;<br>They shall loll no more at festive meals.<br>
My Lord G<small>OD</small> swears by Himself:<br>I loathe <sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">A poetic designation of the northern kingdom.</i>the Pride of Jacob,<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup><br>And I detest his fortresses.<br>I will declare forfeit city and inhabitants alike<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of Hosts.
If ten people are left in one house, they shall die.
<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>And if someone’s kinsman—who is to burn incense for him—comes to carry the remains out of a house,<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup> and he calls to the one at the rear of the house, “Are there any alive besides you?” he will answer, “No, none.” And he will say, “Hush!”—so that no one may utter the name of the L<small>ORD</small>.
For the L<small>ORD</small> will command,<br>And the great house shall be smashed to bits,<br>And the little house to splinters.<br>
Can horses gallop on a rock?<br><sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain; emendation yields “Can one plow the sea with oxen?”</i>Can it be plowed with oxen?<sup class="endFootnote">-f</sup><br>Yet you have turned justice into poison weed<br>And the fruit of righteousness to wormwood.
[Ah,] those who are so happy about Lo-dabar,<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Two towns east of the Jordan recovered for Israel by Jeroboam II (see 2 Kings 14.25). For Lo-dabar, cf. 2 Sam. 9.4, 5; 17.27; for Karnaim, cf.

But I, O House of Israel,<br>Will raise up a nation against you<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>, the God of Hosts—<br>Who will harass you from Lebo-Hamath<br>To the Wadi Arabah.

Chapter 7

This is what my Lord G<small>OD</small> showed me: He was creating [a plague of] locusts at the time when the late-sown crops were beginning to sprout—<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain. The king’s reaping of fodder apparently occurred near the end of the rainy season, and whatever the locust destroyed after that could not be replaced for another year.</i>the late-sown crops after the king’s reaping.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>
When it had finished devouring the herbage in the land, I said, “O Lord G<small>OD</small>, pray forgive. How will Jacob survive? He is so small.”
The L<small>ORD</small> relented concerning this. “It shall not come to pass,” said the L<small>ORD</small>.
This is what the Lord G<small>OD</small> showed me: Lo, my Lord G<small>OD</small> was summoning <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “flaming.”</i>to contend by<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup> fire which consumed the Great Deep and was consuming the fields.
I said, “Oh, Lord G<small>OD</small>, refrain! How will Jacob survive? He is so small.”
The L<small>ORD</small> relented concerning this. “That shall not come to pass, either,” said my Lord G<small>OD</small>.
This is what He showed me: He was standing on a wall <sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Or “destined for the pickax”; meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>checked with a plumb line<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup> and He was holding a plumb line.<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Or “pickax”; meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>
And the L<small>ORD</small> asked me, “What do you see, Amos?” “A plumb line,”<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Or “pickax”; meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> I replied. And my Lord declared, “I am going to apply a plumb line<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Or “pickax”; meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> to My people Israel; I will pardon them no more.
The shrines of Isaac shall be laid waste, and the sanctuaries of Israel reduced to ruins; and I will turn upon the House of Jeroboam with the sword.”<br>
Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent this message to King Jeroboam of Israel: “Amos is conspiring against you within the House of Israel. The country cannot endure the things he is saying.
For Amos has said, ‘Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall be exiled from its soil.’”
Amaziah also said to Amos, “Seer, off with you to the land of Judah! <sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “eat bread.”</i>Earn your living<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup> there, and do your prophesying there.
But don’t ever prophesy again at Bethel; for it is a king’s sanctuary and a royal palace.”
Amos answered Amaziah: “I am not a prophet,<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., by profession.</i> and I am not a prophet’s disciple. I am a cattle breeder<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain; emendation yields “sheep breeder”; cf. the next verse and 1.1.</i> and a tender of sycamore figs.
But the L<small>ORD</small> took me away from following the flock, and the L<small>ORD</small> said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to My people Israel.’
And so, hear the word of the L<small>ORD</small>. You say I must not prophesy about the House of Israel or preach about the House of Isaac;
but this, I swear, is what the L<small>ORD</small> said: Your wife shall <sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “be ravished”; cf. Lam. 5.11.</i>play the harlot<sup class="endFootnote">-h</sup> in the town, your sons and daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be divided up with a measuring line. And you yourself shall die on unclean soil;<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Hos. 9.3 and note.</i> for Israel shall be exiled from its soil.”

Chapter 8

This is what my Lord G<small>OD</small> showed me: There was a basket of figs.<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. qayiṣ, lit. “summer fruit.”</i>
He said, “What do you see, Amos?” “A basket of figs,” I replied. And the L<small>ORD</small> said to me: “The <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. qeṣ.</i>hour of doom<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup> has come for My people Israel; I will not pardon them again.
And the singing women of the palace shall howl on that day—declares my Lord G<small>OD</small>:<br>So many corpses<br>Left lying everywhere!<br>Hush!”<br>
Listen to this, you <sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “who on every new moon devour the needy, and on every sabbath the humble of the land”; cf. v. 5.</i>who devour the needy, annihilating the poor of the land,<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup>
saying, “If only the new moon were over, so that we could sell grain; the sabbath, so that we could offer wheat for sale, <sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Giving short measures of grain, but using oversize weights for the silver received in payment.</i>using an <i>ephah</i> that is too small, and a shekel that is too big,<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup> tilting a dishonest scale,
and selling grain refuse as grain! We will buy the poor for silver, the needy for a pair of sandals.”
The L<small>ORD</small> swears by<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Or “concerning”; cf. 6.8 with note.</i> the Pride of Jacob: “I will never forget any of their doings.”
Shall not the earth shake for this<br>And all that dwell on it mourn?<br>Shall it not all rise like the Nile<br>And surge and subside like the Nile of Egypt?
And in that day<br>—declares my Lord G<small>OD</small>—<br>I will make the sun set at noon,<br>I will darken the earth on a sunny day.
I will turn your festivals into mourning<br>And all your songs into dirges;<br>I will put sackcloth on all loins<br>And tonsures on every head.<br>I will make it<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the earth; cf. vv. 8 and 9d.</i> mourn as for an only child,<br>All<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “the end.”</i> of it as on a bitter day.<br>
A time is coming—declares my Lord G<small>OD</small>—when I will send a famine upon the land: not a hunger for bread or a thirst for water, but for hearing the words of the L<small>ORD</small>.
Men shall wander from <sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Emendation yields “south to west.”</i>sea to sea<sup class="endFootnote">-h</sup> and from north to east to seek the word of the L<small>ORD</small>, but they shall not find it.<br>
In that day, the beautiful maidens and the young men shall faint with thirst—
Those who swear by the guilt of Samaria,<br>Saying, “As your god lives, Dan,”<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">See 1 Kings 12.28–29.</i><br>And “As the way to Beer-sheba lives”<sup class="footnote-marker">j</sup><i class="footnote">See 5.5 with note.</i>—<br>They shall fall to rise no more.

Chapter 9

I saw my L<small>ORD</small> standing by the altar, and He said: <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Strike the capitals so that the thresholds quake, and make an end of the first of them all.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> And I will slay the last of them with the sword; not one of them shall escape, and not one of them shall survive.
If they burrow down to Sheol,<br>From there My hand shall take them;<br>And if they ascend to heaven,<br>From there I will bring them down.
If they hide on the top of Carmel,<br>There I will search them out and seize them;<br>And if they conceal themselves from My sight<br>At the bottom of the sea,<br>There I will command<br>The serpent to bite them.
And if they go into captivity<br>Before their enemies,<br>There I will command<br>The sword to slay them.<br>I will fix My eye on them for evil<br>And not for good.<br>
It is my Lord the G<small>OD</small> of Hosts<br>At whose touch the earth trembles<br>And all who dwell on it mourn,<br>And all of it swells like the Nile<br>And subsides like the Nile of Egypt;
Who built His chambers in heaven<br>And founded His vault on the earth,<br>Who summons the waters of the sea<br>And pours them over the land—<br>His name is the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>
To Me, O Israelites, you are<br>Just like the Cushites<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>True, I brought Israel up<br>From the land of Egypt,<br>But also the Philistines from Caphtor<br>And the Arameans from Kir.
Behold, the Lord G<small>OD</small> has His eye<br>Upon the sinful kingdom:<br>I will wipe it off<br>The face of the earth!<br><br>But, I will not wholly wipe out<br>The House of Jacob<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>.
For I will give the order<br>And shake the House of Israel—<br>Through all the nations—<br>As one shakes [sand] in a sieve,<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">A coarse sieve used for cleansing grain of straw and stones, or sand of pebbles and shells.</i><br>And not a pebble falls to the ground.
All the sinners of My people<br>Shall perish by the sword,<br>Who boast,<br>“Never shall the evil<br>Overtake us or come near us.”<br>
In that day,<br>I will set up again the fallen booth of David:<br>I will mend its breaches and set up its ruins anew.<br>I will build it firm as in the days of old,
<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the House of David shall reestablish its authority over the nations that were ruled by David.</i>So that they shall possess the rest of Edom<br>And all the nations once attached to My name<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup><br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small> who will bring this to pass.
A time is coming<br>—declares the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>When the plowman shall meet the reaper,<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Lev. 26.5.</i><br>And the treader of grapes<br>Him who holds the [bag of] seed;<br>When the mountains shall drip wine<br>And all the hills shall wave [with grain].<br>
I will restore My people Israel.<br>They shall rebuild ruined cities and inhabit them;<br>They shall plant vineyards and drink their wine;<br>They shall till gardens and eat their fruits.
And I will plant them upon their soil,<br>Nevermore to be uprooted<br>From the soil I have given them<br>—said the L<small>ORD</small> your God.
