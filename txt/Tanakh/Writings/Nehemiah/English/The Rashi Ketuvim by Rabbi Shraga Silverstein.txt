Nehemiah



Chapter 1

	The words [written] by Nechemiah the son of Chachalyah: And it was in the month of Kislev, the twentieth year [of the reign of Artachshast (Darius)], and I was in Shushan, the capital city.
	And Chanani, one of my friends, he and [other] men came from Judah, and I inquired of them about the remnant of the Jews, who were left [in Jerusalem] from the [Babylonian] captivity, and about Jerusalem.
	And they answered me [(in the order of my inquiries)]: The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the land are in dire straits and in shame. And the wall of Jerusalem is breached, and its gates burnt in fire [(the Jews having restored only the Temple, but not the city walls)].
	And it was, when I heard these words, I sat and wept, and I mourned for [several] days, and I fasted and prayed before the G-d of Heaven.
	And I said: I beseech You, O L-rd, G d of heaven, the great and awesome G d [viz. Daniel 9:4], keeper of the covenant and lovingkindness to His lovers and to the keepers of His mitzvoth.
	May Your ear be inclined and Your eyes open to hear the prayer of Your servant, which I pray before You this day, day and night, for the children of Israel, Your servants; and (I) make confession for the sins which the children of Israel have sinned against You, and (which) I and my father's house have sinned.
	We have acted corruptly against You, and we have not kept the mitzvoth and the statutes and the judgments which You commanded to Moses Your servant.
	Remember, now, Your charge to Moses Your servant: (If) you are faithless, I will spread you among the peoples,
	but if you return to Me, and keep My mitzvoth and do them, (even) if your cast-off ones be in the end of the heavens, from there I will gather them and bring them to the place wherein I have chosen to repose My name. [(viz. Deuteronomy 30:4)].
	And they are Your servants and Your people that You have redeemed with Your great strength and Your strong hand.
	I beseech you, O L-rd, let Your ear be inclined to the prayer of Your servant [(himself)] and to the prayer of Your servants [(Israel)], who desire to fear Your name. And prosper, I pray You, Your servant this day, and render him [(an object of)] compassion before this man [(Darius)]. (And I was the king's cupbearer.)

Chapter 2

	And it was, in the month of Nissan, the twentieth year of Artachshast [(Darius)] the king, [they brought] wine before him [(in the courtyard)] and I took [(the cup of wine)] and gave it to the king, and I had [never before] been downcast before him [(but always cheerful)].
	And the king said to me: Why are you downcast? This must be badness of heart [i.e., you must be plotting to poison me with the wine]; and I feared greatly [(for my life)].
	And I said to the king: May the king live forever. Why should I not be downcast when the city of the graves of my fathers [(Jerusalem)] is in ruins, and her gates consumed with fire?
	And the king said: What is your request [(and I shall grant it)], and I [(Nechemiah)] prayed before the G-d of heaven [(saying: So be it before the G-d of heaven that you [the king] grant my request)].
	And I said to the king: If it pleases the king, and if your servant is worthy in your eyes, [my request is] that you send me to Judah, to the city of the graves of my fathers and that I rebuild it.
	And the king said to me (the queen sitting at his side): When do you wish to go and when will you return? And it [(my request)] was good before the king, and he sent me [i.e., he permitted me to go], and I gave him a time [(for my return)].
	And I said to the king: If it pleases the king, let them [(your scribes)] give me letters [of authorization from you] to the governors across the river that they escort me [(in safety)] until I come to [Jerusalem in] Judah.
	And [I request that] you send a letter to Asaf, keeper of the king's forests, that he give me timber for roofing the gates of the Temple walls and for the city walls and for the house in which I will live.
	And I came to the governors across the river, and I gave them the king's letters, (and the king had sent with me officers and horsemen [to escort me]).
	And [when] Sanvalat the Choronite and Toviah, the Ammonite slave, heard [why I had come], it grieved them greatly that a man had come to seek the good of the children of Israel.
	And I came to Jerusalem and I stayed there for three days.
	And I arose at night, I and a few men with me, and I told no one what my G-d had placed it in my heart to do with Jerusalem; and there were no beasts with me, but only the beast on which I rode [(so that they could leave without being detected and he could execute what he had in mind)].
	And I went out at night [(with the few men who were with me)] through the Gate of the Valley towards Ein Tanin and to the Dung Gate [in the walls of the city], and I breached [(even more)] the walls of Jerusalem, which were [(already)] breached and whose gates had been consumed by fire.
	And I [wished to] pass on to the Spring Gate and to the King's pool, but there was no room [(in those breaches)] for the beast under me to pass on.
	So I went up the valley at night, breaking the wall [(with the men who were with me)], and I returned and came to the Gate of the Valley, and I returned [(whence I had come)].
	And the [city] officers did not know where I had gone and what I had done, and I had not told (of it) until then to the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officers, and the rest of the functionaries.
	And [(the next day)] I said to them: You see the evil in which we find ourselves, that Jerusalem is in ruins and its gates consumed in fire. Let us go and build the wall of Jerusalem and not be [reduced to] shame anymore.
	And I told them of the hand of my G-d upon me for the good [(i.e., His having granted me favor in the eyes of the king)], and also the words of the king that he had spoken to me. And they said: Let us arise and build! And they strengthened their hands for the good [i.e., for the building of the wall and the towers of the city.]
	And Sanvalat the Choronite and Toviah the Ammonite slave and Geshem the Arab heard, and they mocked and scorned us, saying: What is this thing that you do? Would you rebel against the king!
	And I rejoined: The G-d of heaven, He will prosper us, and we, His servants, will arise and build. As for you, [what business do you have with building the city wall]? You have no share or righteousness or remembrance in Jerusalem!

Chapter 3

	And Elyashiv the high-priest arose with his brother priests and they built the Sheep Gate. They sanctified it [(with the sanctity of the city)], and they set up its doors [(the doors of the gate)]. And they sanctified it until the Tower of the Hundred, until the Tower of Chananel.
	And near him [i.e., near every builder who built the Sheep Gate], the men of Yereicho built [the portion assigned to them]. And near him [i.e., near each of the men of Yereicho], Zakkur the son of Imri built.
	And the Fish Gate was built by the sons of Hassna'ah. They built it and set up its doors, its locks and its bars.
	And near them adding [(to the wall)], were Meremoth, the son of Uriah, the son of Hakotz [and his men]; and near them, adding, were Meshulam, the son of Berechyah, the son of Meshezavel; and near them, adding, was Tzaddok the son of Ba'anah.
	And near them, adding, were the Tekoites. But their wealthy ones did not place their necks under the labor of their L-rd.
	And the Old Gate was restored by Yoyada the son of Paseach and Meshulam the son of Besodyah. They roofed it and set up its doors and its locks and its bars.
	And near them, adding, were Melatyah the Giveonite and Yadon the Meronothite, men of Giveon and Mitzpah, for the seat of the governor from across the river.
	Near him, Uziel the son of Charhaya of the Tzorfim added, and near him, Chananyah of the family of the Rakachim seconded. And they filled up Jerusalem with sand until the Broad wall [(to reinforce it)].
	And near them, Refayah the son of Chur, chief of half the population of Jerusalem, added.
	And near them, Yedayah the son of Charumaf added, near his house, [(the city wall adjoining his house)]. And near him, Chatush the son of Chashavnayah added.
	A second measure [of wall] [(corresponding to that of his upper neighbor [verse 10])] was added by Malkiyah the son of Charim and by Chashuv, the son of the governor of Moav, as well as the Tanurim Tower.
	And near him, adding, were Shalum the son of Halochesh, chief of half the principality of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.
	The Gate of the Valley was added by Chanun and the inhabitants of Zanoach. They built it and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars, and one thousand cubits of the wall, until [(but not including)] the Dung Gate.
	And the Dung Gate was added by Malkiyah the son of Rechav, the chief of the principality of Beth-hakerem. He built it and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars.
	And the Ayin Gate was added by Shalun the son of Kol-chozeh, chief of the principality of Mitzpah. He built it and decked it and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars, and the wall of the pool of Shelach leading to the king's garden until the steps descending from the city of David.
	After him, Nechemiah the son of Azbuk, chief of half the principality of Beth-tzur, added [to the wall] until opposite the graves of David, until the artificial pool, until Beth-hagibborim.
	After him, the Levites added, Rechum the son of Bani. Near him, Chashavyah the chief of half the principality of Keilah added [to the wall] for his principality.
	After him, their brother [Levites] added, Bavai the son of Chenadad, the chief of half the principality of Keilah.
	And Ezer the son of Yeshua, chief of Mitzpah, added near him a second measure [of wall, corresponding with his,] opposite the corner ascent [of the wall] to the weapon supply.
	After him, Baruch the son of Zabbai added a second measure, from the corner to the entrance of the house of Elyashiv the high-priest.
	After him, Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakotz added a second measure from the entrance of the house of Elyashiv until the end of the house of Elyashiv.
	And after him, the priests, the men of the plain, added.
	And after him, Benjamin and Chashuv added opposite their houses [(which were near the wall)]. After him, Azaryah the son of Ma'aseyah the son of Ananyah added opposite his house.
	After him, Binui the son of Chenadad added a second measure, from the house of Azaryah until the corner and until the Pinah [(the corner tower)].
	Pallal the son of Uzzai [added] opposite the corner and the tower projecting from the king's upper house in the prison courtyard. After him, Pedayah the son of Parosh [added].
	And the Nethinim dwelt in the Ofel [and added from their district, which was near the wall] until opposite the Water Gate to the east, as well as the projecting tower.
	After them, the Tekoites added a second measure opposite the great projecting tower and until the wall of the Ofel.
	Above the Horse Gate, the priests added, each opposite his house.
	After them, Tzaddok the son of Immer added opposite his house, and after him, Shemayah the son of Shechanyah, keeper of the eastern gate, added.
	After him, Chananiah the son of Shelemyah and Chanun the sixth son of Tzalaf added a second measure. After them, Meshulam the son of Berechyah added opposite his quarters.
	After him, Malkiyah the son of the Tzorfi added until the house of the Nethinim and the merchants, opposite the Mifkad Gate, and until the ascent of the Pinah.
	And between the ascent of the Pinah until the Sheep Gate [(where the wall had begun [viz. verse 1])], the smiths and the merchants added.
	And it was, when Sanvalet heard that we were building the wall, he was irate and extremely wroth, and he mocked the Jews.
	And he said before his brothers and the host of Shomron [(oppressors of Judah)]. What are these debilitated Jews doing? Will they [(the idolators)] allow them [(to continue to build)]? Will they [eternally] sacrifice [their offerings]? Will they finish [their work] in [one] day [(so that the idolators not halt it)]! Will they resurrect the stones [they are building with] from the piles of earth [where they found them fallen] when they are [completely] burnt!
	And Toviah the Ammonite was at his side, and he said: Even if a wolf go up against what they are building he will breach the wall of their stones!
	[(When I heard their mockery, I prayed)]: Hear, our G-d, for we have been made [(objects of)] shame, and return their insults to their heads, and reduce them to shame in the land of [their] captivity [(when they are exiled)]!
	And do not cover up their transgressions, and do not erase their sins from before You, for they have vented their anger at the builders [(by mocking them)]!
	And we [continued] building the wall, and when [the breaches of] half the wall had been filled, the heart of the people was [inspired] to do [i.e., to complete it].

Chapter 4

	And it was, when Sanvalet and Toviah and the Arabs and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem had been "healed," that the "breached ones" [(the Jews of the city)] had [now] been closed in, they were extremely wroth.
	And they all banded together to come to war against Jerusalem and to render it [(the wall)] a ruin.
	And we prayed to our G-d, and we set up a guard for them [(the builders)] day and night against them [(the invaders)].
	And Judah said [(in fear of the foe)]: The strength of the workers has waned and the earth [(for building)] is much [i.e., there is yet much for us to build], and we shall not be able to build the wall.
	[(Nechemiah says what follows:)] And our foes said: They [(Israel)] will not know [(of our presence)] and they will not see until we come into their midst and we will halt the work.
	And it was, when the Jews who dwelt with them came and told us ten times: From all the places [(where you find yourselves engaged in the work of the wall, assemble when they attack until)] you return upon us [(to fight us)].
	And I positioned beneath that place [(around Jerusalem)] behind the wall [(on the outside)] (and) on the rocks — I positioned the people by [the strongest of] their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
	And when I saw [(the foe approaching)], I arose and said to the nobles, the officers, and the rest of the people: Do not fear them. Remember the great, awesome L-rd, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your homes!
	And it was, when our foes heard that [their intent] was known to us, G-d destroyed their counsel and we all returned to the wall, each to his work.
	And it was, from that day on, that half of my [strong] youths did the work [on the wall] while the [other] half held the spears, the shields, the bows and the armor. And the chiefs backed up all [the tribes of] the house of Judah.
	The builders of the wall and the carriers of the loads, with one hand did their work, and with the other held a weapon.
	And each man built, with his sword tied to his thighs; and the blower of the shofar [(to alert the men in case of an attack)] was [always] at my side.
	And I said to the nobles and to the officers and to the rest of the people: The work is great and wide [spread], and we are separated on the wall, distant, one from the other.
	In the place where you hear the sound of the shofar, there shall you gather to us, (and) G-d shall fight for us.
	And we did the work, and half held the spears, from dawn until dusk.
	Also at that time I said to the people: Let each man and his youth spend the night in Jerusalem — so that the night was for us for guarding, and the day for work.
	And neither I, nor my brethren, nor my youths, nor the men of the watch after me took off our clothes [to sleep] or [to wash them] in water.

Chapter 5

	And the outcry of [the poor of] the people and their wives was great against their brother Jews [(the rich, who refused to feed them)].
	Some of them said [(i.e., they cried out to the rich Jews)]: [With] our sons and daughters we are [too] many [to survive. We will have to sell them] to buy grain in order to eat and live!
	And some said: We will [have to] pawn our fields and our vineyards and our houses to buy grain in (our) hunger!
	And some said: We have [already] borrowed money (on) our fields and vineyards to [pay] the king's taxes [(and we have nothing left to feed ourselves with)]!
	And now, [just as good] as our [rich] brothers' flesh is our flesh! [Just as good as] their sons are our sons! And, behold, we will have to impress our sons and daughters as slaves; and some of our daughters are [already] impressed, and we have not the wherewithal [to redeem them]. And our fields and vineyards [have already been given] to others [for food, and what shall we eat now!]
	And I was greatly troubled when I heard their cries and these things.
	And my heart counseled me, and I quarreled with the nobles and the officers and said to them: You are exacting payment, each of his brother, [(by lending the poor in order to impress their sons and daughters and take their fields, their vineyards, and their houses.)] And I congregated against them a great crowd [(of the poor to cry out against them and shame them.)]
	And I said to them: We have [already] bought back our brother Jews [in captivity] who had been sold to the gentiles, with whatever [money] we had; yet you, too, would sell your brothers [impressed under you, to the gentiles], and [in the end] they would be sold to us [i.e., we would have to buy them back!] And they were [struck] silent [in shame] and they found nothing [to say].
	And I said: This thing that you do is not good [(before the L-rd)]. Would you not pursue the fear of G d in the face of the shame of [i.e., your being shamed by] the gentiles, our foes!
	And I, too, (and) my brethren and my youths are their creditors in money and in grain, and we shall now waive this debt [(and you follow our example!)]
	Return to them, now, as of this day, their fields, their vineyards, their olive orchards, and their houses, and most of the money and the grain and the wine and the oil wherein you are their creditors.
	And they said: We shall return (it) and we shall ask nothing of them. We shall do exactly as you have said. And I called the priests and I beswore them to do as this thing [i.e., to waive their loans].
	I also shook out my hem and said: So shall G d shake out every man who does not fulfill this thing, of his house and of his toil [i.e., his possessions], and thus shall he remain shaken out and empty. And all the congregation said "Amen!" and they praised the L-rd, and the people did according to this thing [i.e., as they had averred.]
	Also, from the day that he [(the king)] charged me to be governor of the land of Judah, from the twentieth year [(of the reign of King Darius, at which time Nechemiah went up from Bavel [viz. chapter 2])] until the thirty-second year of Artachshast [Darius] the king — twelve years — I and my brethren have not eaten the governor's bread [(a perquisite of the collection of taxes for the king)].
	And the governors before me had imposed heavy [taxes] upon the people and had taken from them [for this service to the king] bread and wine, on top of forty silver shekels. And their youths, too, had lorded it over the people. But I did not do so, out of fear of G-d.
	And I also was [constantly] preoccupied with the work of this wall, and we [(I and my co-workers)] did not buy a field [(of the Jews building the wall wherewith to compensate them for their labors, but I paid them from my own funds)], and all of my youths were gathered there over the work.
	And, at my table were the Jews [(of the people)] and the officers, a hundred and fifty men, (aside from those [i.e., the proselytes] who came to us from the nations around us.)
	And, one day's fare was one ox (and) five stuffed sheep; and [an abundance of] fowl was prepared for me. And [every day we drank] enough wine for ten days. And, notwithstanding all this [i.e., all these expenses], I did not request [(from the people)] the governor's bread, for the work [of the wall] was heavy on this people.
	Remember unto me, my G-d, for good, all that I have done with this people.

Chapter 6

	And it was, when it was heard by Sanvalat and Toviah and Geshem the Arab and the rest of our foes that I had built the wall and no breach remained in it, (and) also, (that) up to that time I had not set doors in the gates [(viz. verse 10)],
	that Sanvalat and Geshem sent to me, saying: Go, and we will meet together in Kefirim in the valley of Ono (and [I understood that] they were plotting to do me evil [i.e., to kill me])
	And I sent to them messengers, saying: I am busy with a great project and I will not be able to come down. Why should the work halt? When I complete it, I will come down to you.
	And they sent me in this wise four times, and I returned answer in this wise [i.e., as I had before].
	And Sanvalat sent me in this wise a fifth time by his youth with an open [i.e., an unsealed] letter in his hand.
	In it, such words were written: It has been heard [(by all the gentiles)] and Gashmu [the Arab also] says: You and the Jews are plotting to rebel, wherefore you are building the wall, and you would be their king.
	And you have also set up speakers to proclaim over you in Jerusalem: "There is a king in Judah!" And now, these things will be heard by the king. And now, come, and we will take counsel together.
	And I sent to him, saying: These things that you speak of are not so; you are imagining them.
	For all of them [(the gentiles)] fear us, wherefore they say: Let them leave off the work so that it not be done. And now, assist me [(in building the wall)].
	And I came to the house of Shemayah the son of Delayah the son of Mehetavel [(a false prophet, hired by Sanvalat and his cohorts to frighten Nechemiah into halting the work on the wall)], and he was at home. And he said: Let us meet in the house of G-d, in the midst of the sanctuary, and let us lock the doors of the sanctuary, for they are coming to kill you [(by way of the city gates, which were still without doors, [viz. 1])]; and they are coming to kill you tonight.
	And I said: Shall a man such as I run away [(out of fear)]? And who such as I [(a non-priest)] may come to the sanctuary and live? [viz. Numbers 3:38] I shall not come!
	And I realized that, behold, not G-d had sent him (for he spoke [these things] to me [as being] prophecy) and (that) Toviah and Sanvalat had hired him.
	Because he was hired [(had he spoken thus to me)], so that I should fear and do this [i.e., enter the sanctuary] and sin and enable them to vilify me [(as a sinner)] and shame me.
	Remember, my G-d, Toviah and Sanvalat [to punish them] for these deeds, as well as Noadiah the prophetess and the other prophets who would frighten me [for hire].
	And the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of Elul [(in the twentieth year of King Darius, when Nechemiah had come up from Bavel)], on the fifty-second day [(after building had begun)].
	And when all of our foes heard and all the nations around us saw [(that the city wall had been completed)], they fell greatly in their (own) eyes, [(the fear of the Jews falling upon them)], and they knew that it was from the L-rd that this work had been done.
	Even in those days the nobles of Judah sent letters frequently to Toviah [(a wicked Jew)], and those of Toviah came to them.
	For many in Judah were covenanted with him. For he was a son-in-law of Shechanyah the son of Arach, and Jonathan his [(Toviah's)] son had wed the daughter of Meshulam the son of Berechyah.
	They also told of his prowess, and they told him of my affairs. (Toviah had [always] sent letters to frighten me [(not to build the wall)]).

Chapter 7

	And it was, when the wall had been built, and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers and the singers and the Levites had been installed,
	that I charged Chanani my brother and Chananiah, chief of the capital with [the guarding of the gates of] Jerusalem, for he was a man of truth and feared G-d of yore.
	And I said to them: Let the gates of Jerusalem not be opened until the heat of the day [i.e., midday]. [(While the gates were open, they were to remain standing there, and whoever wished to leave or enter did so at that time.)] And while they were [yet] standing [there], they were to take hold of the doors to close (them). And [("I said to them":)] Station watches (of) the inhabitants of Jerusalem, each in his watch and each opposite his house.
	And the city was spacious and large, and the people few in its midst, and the houses not built up.
	And my G-d put it in my heart to gather the nobles and the officers and the people to trace their genealogies, and I found the book of genealogies of those who had come up first [(with Ezra)], and I found it written there:
	These are the men of the land [(Eretz Yisrael)] who went up from the captivity of the exile, where they were exiled by Nevuchadnezzar king of Bavel. And they returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, each to his city.

	And of the priests, the sons of Chavayah, the sons of Hakotz, the sons of Barzilai [each of whose sons] took of the daughters of Barzilai as a wife, and whose [(Barzilai's)] name was called upon them —
	these [priests], who would trace themselves [to the priesthood] sought their [genealogical] records, and they could not be found, and they were rejected from the priesthood.
	And Hatirshatha [(Nechemiah the son of Chachalyah)] told them that they should not [(as other priests)] eat of the holy of holies [(sin-offerings and guilt-offerings)] until a priest should arise for the urim vetumim [(to all intents and purposes, "until the days of the Messiah")].
	All the congregation together [(including the priests, the Levites, the Nethinim and the other tribes — those counted above being only those of Judah and Benjamin —)] were forty-two thousand and three hundred and sixty.
	Aside from their men-servants and their maid-servants, who numbered seven thousand and three hundred and thirty-seven. And with them were men-singers and women-singers, two hundred and forty-five [(to bring them back to Eretz Yisrael with joy)].
	(Their horses, seven hundred and thirty-six. Their mules, two hundred and forty-five.) Their camels, four hundred and thirty-five. Asses, six thousand and seven hundred and twenty.
	And some of the heads of the fathers' houses contributed to the work [viz. Ezra 2:68-69]. Hatirshatha [(Nechemiah)] gave to the [Temple] treasury one thousand golden darkemonim, fifty basins, and three hundred and fifty priestly tunics [(in which to minister)].
	And some of the heads of the fathers' houses gave to the building fund twenty thousand golden darkemonim and two thousand and five hundred silver manim.
	And what the rest of the people gave — twenty thousand golden darkemonim, two thousand silver manim, and sixty-seven priestly tunics.
	And the priests and the Levites and the gatekeepers and the singers and some of the people [(those of Judah and Benjamin)] and the Nethinim and all of Israel [(those of the other tribes)] dwelt in their cities [(i.e., what had been the cities of their inheritance before they were exiled)]. And the seventh month arrived and the children of Israel were in their cities.

Chapter 8

	And all the people gathered as one man to the square before the Water Gate, and they asked Ezra the scribe to bring the scroll of the Torah of Moses which the L-rd had commanded to Israel.
	And Ezra the priest brought the Torah before the congregation, from man to woman and all who could hear with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month [i.e., Rosh Hashanah].
	And he read in it before the square in front of the Water Gate from daylight until midday before the men, the women, and (the others) who understood. And the ears of all the people were to the Torah scroll.
	And Ezra stood on a wooden platform that they had made for the thing [(the reading of the Torah scroll)]. And there stood next to him: Matithyah, Shema, Anayah, Uriah, Chilkiyah, and Ma'aseyah, on his right; and, on his left, Pedayah, Mishael, Malkiyah, Chusham, Chashbadnah, Zecharyah, and Meshulam.
	And Ezra opened the scroll in the sight of all of the people (for he was [standing] above all of the people). And when he opened it, all of the people stood silent.
	And Ezra blessed the L-rd, the great G d, and all the people answered Amen! Amen! with hands uplifted [in praise of the L-rd]. And they bowed down and prostrated themselves to the L-rd with their faces to the ground.
	And Yeshua, Bani, Sherevyah, Yamin, Akuv, Shabthai, Hodiyah, Ma'aseyah, Kelita, Azaryah, Yozavad, Chanan, Pelayah, and the Levites explained the Torah to the people, the people standing.
	And they read in the explicated scroll of the Torah of G-d with application, and they understood what was written.
	And Nechemiah (Tirshatha) and Ezra the priest, the scribe, and the Levites, the edifiers of the people, said to all the people: This day is holy to the L-rd your G d; do not mourn and do not weep. For all the people wept [(for their remissness in fulfilling the Torah)] when they heard the words of the Torah.
	And he said to them: Go, eat fat things and drink sweet things and send portions to him [i.e., to the poor one] who has no [food] readied. For this day is holy to our L-rd. And do not be sad, for the L-rd's joy is your stronghold.
	And the Levites hushed all the people, saying: Be still, for this is a holy day; do not be sad.
	And all the people went to eat and to drink and to send portions and to make great festivity, for they understood the things whereof they apprised them.
	And on the second day [(of Rosh Hashanah)] there gathered the heads of the fathers' [houses] of all the people (and) the priests and the Levites to Ezra the scribe to probe the words of the Torah.
	And they found it written in the Torah that the L-rd had commanded through Moses that the children of Israel were to dwell in succoth on the festival in the seventh month.
	[And they commanded] that they make heard and proclaim throughout all of their cities and in Jerusalem: "Go out to the mountain and bring olive leaves and olive-tree leaves and myrtle leaves [(for roofing the succah)] and date-palm leaves [(for the lulav)] and leaves of a plaited tree [(hadassim)] to observe Succoth as written."
	And the people went out and brought [(what they had been instructed to bring)], and they made succoth for themselves, each on his roof and in their courtyards and in the courts of the house of G-d and in the square of the Water Gate and in the square of the Gate of Ephraim.
	And all the congregation that had returned from the captivity made succoth, and they dwelt in the succoth. For the children of Israel had not done so from the days of Yeshua the son of Nun until that day. And the joy was very great.
	And he read in the scroll of the Torah of G-d every day [of the festival], from the first day until the last day. And they observed the festival for seven days, and on the eighth day, atzereth, as prescribed [viz. Leviticus 23:26].

Chapter 9

	And on the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of Israel gathered together in fasting and in sackcloth and (with) earth upon them [i.e., upon their heads].
	And the seed of Israel were separated from all of the foreigners [i.e., the idolators, and from their foreign wives (viz. Ezra 9 and 10)], and they arose and made confession for their sins and for the transgressions of their fathers.
	And they stood in their places and read in the scroll of the Torah of the L-rd their G d a quarter of the day, and (another) quarter, they made confession and prostrated themselves to the L-rd their G d.
	And there arose on the ascent of the Levites [(on which they stood when they chanted)] Yeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shevanyah, Buni, Sherevyah, Bani (and) Kenani, and they cried out in a great voice to the L-rd their G d.
	And the Levites said — Yeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Chahashav'nyah, Sherevyah, Hodiyah, Shevanyah (and) Petachyah — Arise and bless the L-rd your G d from the [beginning of] the world until the [end of] the world, and, [(addressing themselves to the Shechinah)], let them [(Israel)] bless the name of Your glory, which is exalted over all blessing and praise [(being their source)].
	You are the L-rd alone. You made the heavens and the heavens of the heavens and all their hosts; the earth and all that is upon it; the seas and all that is in them. And You give life to all, and the host of heaven bows down to you.
	You are the L-rd G d who chose Avram and took him out of Ur-Kasdim and made his name Avraham.
	And You found his heart faithful before You, and You made a covenant with him to give him the land of the Canaani, the Perizi, the Yevussi and the Girgashi to give to his seed. And You fulfilled Your word, for You are righteous.
	And You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and You heard their outcry at the Red Sea.
	And You placed signs and wonders in Pharaoh and in all his servants and in all the people of his land, for You knew that they [(the Egyptians)] devised evil against them [(Israel) viz. Exodus 18:11], and You made Yourself a Name as of this day.
	And You split the sea before them, and they passed over in the midst of the sea on the dry land, and their pursuers You cast into the depths like a stone in mighty waters.
	And with a pillar of cloud You led them by day and with a pillar of fire by night to light them on the way they were to go.
	And You descended on Mount Sinai to speak to them from heaven. And You gave them just judgments and laws of truth, good statutes and mitzvoth.
	And You apprised them of Your holy Sabbath and You commanded unto them mitzvoth and statutes and Torah, by the hand of Moses, Your servant.
	And You gave them bread from heaven in their hunger and water from a rock in their thirst. And You told them to come and inherit the land that You raised Your hand [i.e., that You swore] to give them.
	And they and our fathers sinned wilfully and stiffened their necks and did not heed Your mitzvoth. 
	And they refused to listen and they did not remember the wonders that You had wrought for them. And they stiffened their necks, and they would make a leader for themselves to return to their servitude [of Egypt] in their rebelliousness. But You are a G-d of forgiveness, gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, and You did not forsake them.
	Even though they made for themselves a molten calf and said: "This is your god, who took you up from the land of Egypt"; and they committed great blasphemies.
	Yet You, in Your many mercies, did not forsake them in the desert. The pillar of cloud did not depart from them by day to lead them on the way, and the pillar of fire by night to light them on the way they were to go.
	And You gave them Your goodly spirit to inform them, and You did not keep Your manna from their mouths, and You gave them water in their thirst.
	And You fed them forty years in the desert. They lacked nothing. Their raiment did not wear out and their feet did not swell.
	And You gave them kingdoms and peoples, and You set them apart [(in isolation from the other peoples)]. And they inherited the land of Sichon and the land of the king of Cheshbon and the land of Og, the king of the Bashan.
	And You multiplied their children like the stars of the heavens, and You brought them to the land that you told their fathers to come to and inherit.
	And the children came and inherited the land, and You humbled before them the dwellers of the land, the Canaanites, and You delivered them into their hands, and their kings and the peoples of the land, to do with them as they willed.
	And they conquered fortified cities and fat soil and they inherited houses full of all good (and) hewn-out wells, vineyards, olive yards, and fruit trees in abundance. And they ate and were sated and they fattened and luxuriated in Your great good.
	And they rose up and rebelled against You, and they cast Your Torah behind their backs, and they killed Your prophets who exhorted them to return them to You, and they committed great blasphemies.
	And You delivered them into the hand of their oppressors and they afflicted them. And in the time of their affliction they would cry out to You. And You, in heaven, would hear. And in Your many mercies, You would give them saviors and they would save them from the hand of their oppressors.
	And when (their lot) was eased, they would revert to doing evil before You and You would leave them in the hands of their foes. And they would oppress them and they would again cry out to You. And You, from heaven, would hear. And You would save them in Your mercies many times.
	And You would exhort them to return them to Your Torah. But they acted wilfully and would not heed Your mitzvoth and sinned in Your judgments, which, if a man does them, he lives through them. And they lifted a recalcitrant shoulder and stiffened their necks and would not pay heed.
	And You drew out [Your mercies] to them for many years, and You warned them with Your spirit through Your prophets, but they would not listen.
	And in Your many mercies You did not make an end of them and You did not forsake them, for You are a gracious and merciful G-d.
	And now, our G-d, the great, and mighty, and awesome G-d, Keeper of the covenant and the lovingkindness, let (it) not be little before You, all the suffering that has befallen our kings, our leaders, our priests, our prophets, our fathers, and all Your people, from the days of the kings of Ashur until this day.
	And You are righteous in all [the affliction] that has come upon us. for You have wrought truth and we have been wicked.
	And our kings, our leaders, our priests, and our fathers have not observed Your Torah and have not heeded Your mitzvoth and Your exhortations wherewith You exhorted them.
	And they, in their kingship and in their abundant good which You accorded them and in the broad, fat land that You placed before them did not serve You and did not repent of their wicked deeds.
	Behold, we are servants this day; and the land that You gave our fathers, to eat its fruit and its good — behold, we are servants upon it.
	And its produce adds [luxuries (through the taxes imposed upon us)] to the [gentile] kings that You have placed over us in our sins. And they rule over our bodies and our beasts at their will, and we find ourselves in great distress.

Chapter 10

	And with all this [i.e., notwithstanding all this evil that has come upon us], we are making a covenant and writing it down [(to accept His kingdom over us, so that it serve as witness)], and for the signatories, our leaders, our Levites, and our priests.
	And the signatories [(for the acceptance of the mitzvoth, the majority of our dignitaries)]: Nechemiah-Hatirshatha the son of Chachalyah and Tzidkiyah.

	And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the Nethinim, and all [the proselytes] who had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands unto the Torah of G-d, their wives, their sons, their daughters — all who were possessed of understanding —
	confirmed [the covenant of] their brethren, their dignitaries, and they undertook with oath and vow to walk in the Torah of G d that had been given by the hand of Moses, the servant of G d, and to keep and do all the mitzvoth of the L-rd, our Master, and His mitzvoth and His statutes,
	and not to give our daughters to the people of the land, and not to take their daughters for our sons,
	and not to purchase on Sabbath or holy day from the peoples of the land who bring merchandise and all (kinds of) produce to sell on the Sabbath, and to let the land lie fallow on the seventh year [viz. Exodus 23:11] and [to relinquish] every claim [viz. Deuteronomy 15:2].
	And we took upon ourselves as mitzvoth to give for ourselves a third of a shekel a year [(beyond the prescribed half-shekel [viz. Exodus 30:13])] for the service of the house of our G-d:
	for the show bread and the perpetual oblation and the perpetual burnt-offering and the [offerings for] the Sabbaths, the New Moons, the festivals, and the [communal] (peace-) offerings and sin-offerings to atone for Israel, and for all the [silver] work of the house of our G-d.
	And we cast lots for the offering of wood [for the altar] — the priests, the Levites, and the people — to bring to the house of our G d, the house of [holiness] of our fathers, (to bring it) at set times, year by year, to burn on the altar of the L-rd our G d, as written in the Torah.
	And [we undertook] to bring the first-fruits of our land and the first-fruits of all fruit-trees year by year to the house of our L-rd [(the latter, a rabbinical enactment)]
	and (to bring) the [redemption monies] of our first-born sons and of our beasts [i.e., first-born of asses], as written in the Torah, and the first-born of our cattle and of our flocks, to bring (them) to the house of our G-d, to the priests who serve in the house of our G-d,
	and to bring the first of our dough and our tithes and the fruit of every tree, wine and oil, to the priests, to the chambers of the house of our G-d, and (to bring) the tithe of our land to the Levites, the Levites who take their tithes in all the cities of our work [(in Eretz Israel)].
	And [we undertook that] a priest, a son [i.e., descendant] of Aaron be with the Levites, when the Levites tithed. And the Levites would bring a tithe of the tithe to the house of our G-d to the chambers [(of the priests, [who would not leave the Temple])], to the store-house.
	For to the chambers the sons of Israel and the sons of the Levites would bring the tithe of the grain, the wine, and the oil. And there were found the Temple vessels, and the ministering priests, and the gatekeepers and the singers — so that we not forsake the house of our G-d.

Chapter 11

	And the chiefs of the cities dwelt in Jerusalem, and the rest of the people cast lots to bring one-tenth to dwell in Jerusalem, the holy city, [(to defend it)], and nine-tenths in the (other) cities.
	And the people blessed all those who volunteered to dwell in Jerusalem.

	And Petachyah the son of Meshezavel of the sons of Zerach the son of Judah was a courtier to the king for all the needs of the people.

	And these are the priests and the Levites who went up [from Bavel (viz. Ezra 2:1)] with Zerubavel the son of Shealtiel and Yeshua [the high-priest]: Serayah, Yirmiyah, Ezra.
	Amaryah, Maluch, Chatush.

	And the Levites: Yeshua, Binui, Kadmiel, Sherevyah, Yehudah, Matanyah over huydoth [(types of musical instruments)], he and his brethren.
	And Bakbukyah and Uni, their counterparts, by watches [viz. I Chronicles 24].
	And Yeshua begot Yoyakim, and Yoyakim begot Elyashiv, and Elyashiv begot Yoyada [(All of these were high-priests.)]
	And Yoyada begot Yonathan, and Yonathan begot Yadua.
	And in the days of Yoyakim, [the following] priests were heads of fathers' [houses of their watches]. Of [the watch of] Serayah, Merayah [was head of the father's house]; of Yirmiyah, Chananyah.
	Of Ezra, Meshulam; of Amaryah, Yehonathan.
	Of Melichu, Yonathan; of Shevanyah, Yosef.

	The [following] Levites [viz. 24] were recorded as heads of fathers' [houses in the watches of the Levites] in the days of [the high-priest] Elyashiv, Yoyada and Yochanan and Yadua, as were [also] the [aforementioned] priests, during the reign of Darius the Parsi.
	(The sons of Levi, the heads of the fathers' [houses] are recorded in the book of chronicles until the days of Yochanan, the [grand-] son of Elyashiv.)
	And the heads of the Levites: Chashavyah, Sherevyah, and Yeshua the son of Kadmiel and their brethren alongside them to give praise and thanks according to the charge of David the man of G-d, watch by watch [(the Levites being divided by watches for singing)].
	Matanyah and Bakbukyah, Ovadyah, Meshulam, Talmon, Akuv — watchers. Gatekeepers [were in their] watch [(to guard the Temple gates)] at the thresholds of the gates.
	These [were the gatekeepers] in the days of Yoyakim the son of Yeshua the son of Yotzadak and in the days of Nechemiah the governor and Ezra the priest, the scribe.
	And at the consecration of the wall of Jerusalem [(at its completion)], the Levites were sought out from all of their places to bring them to Jerusalem, to make consecration and joy with thanksgiving and song, (with) cymbals, lyres, and harps.
	And the sons of the singers were gathered together, and (they came) from the plain around Jerusalem and from the cities of the Netofathi.
	And from Beth-hagalil and from the fields of Geva and Azmaveth. For the singers had built themselves cities around Jerusalem.
	And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and [afterwards] they purified the people and the gates and the wall [(that there should be no uncleanliness in the city.)]
	And [(in cleansing the city)] I brought the chiefs of Judah above the wall, and I set up two large thanksgiving loaves, and processions [(leaving the city to encircle it)] to the right, above the wall, to the Dung Gate.
	And there went after them Hoshayah and half the chiefs of Judah.
	And Azaryah, Ezra, and Meshulam.
	Judah and Benjamin and Shemayah and Yirmiyah.
	And of the sons of the priests with trumpets: Zecharya the son of Yonathan the son of Shemayah the son of Matanyah the son of Michayah the son of Zakkur the son of Asaf.
	And his [(Zecharyah's)] brethren — Shemayah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Ma'ai, Nethanel, Judah, and Chanani — with musical instruments of David, the man of G-d, and Ezra the scribe before them.
	And before the Ayin Gate [(they went around the city)], and before them [(i.e., in front of the procession)], they ascended the steps of the city of David on an ascent to the wall, above the house of David, until the Water Gate on the east.
	And the second thanksgiving loaf went opposite [i.e., alongside of the first], and I after it. And half the people were above the wall above the Tannurim Tower until the broad wall.
	And above the Gate of Ephraim and on the old gate and on the Fish Gate and the Chananel Tower and the Tower of the Hundred until the Sheep Gate. And they [i.e., the procession] halted at the Matarah Gate.
	And the two thanksgiving loaves halted at the house of G-d, and I and half the officers with me.
	And the priests — Elyakim, Minyamin, Michayah, Elyoeinai, Zecharyah, Chanyiah — trumpeted [with joy].
	And Ma'aseyah and Shemayah and Elazar and Uzzi and Yehonathan and Malkiyah and Eilam and Azer and Yashmiyu, the singers [also came] with Yizrachyah, their director.
	And they sacrificed on that day a great number of sacrifices and they rejoiced. For G-d had rejoiced them with great rejoicing. And the women and the children, too, rejoiced. And the joy of Jerusalem was heard from afar.
	And men were appointed that day over the storage chambers to store in them terumoth, reishith [(first-fruits)] and ma'asroth from the fields of the cities, the portions of [i.e., prescribed by] the Torah for the priests and the Levites. [(And in those chambers the priests and the Levites would take their respective portions.)] For the joy of Judah was over the priests and the Levites who stood [there rejoicing before the L-rd].
	And they kept the keeping of [the house of] their G-d and the keeping of purity and [they were abetted by] the singers and the gatekeepers, according to the charge of David (to) Solomon his son.
	For [so had it been ordained] or yore in the days of David and Asaf, the chief singers, of prayer and thanksgiving to G-d.
	And all of Israel in the days of Zerubavel and in the days of Nechemiah gave portions to the singers and to the gatekeepers, the portion of the day in its day, and they separated [tithes] to the Levites, and the Levites separated [(from these)] to the sons of Aaron.

Chapter 13

	On that day, the book of Moses was read in the ears of the people, and it was found written in it that an Ammonite or a Moavite may not enter the congregation of G-d [i.e., he may not marry an Israelite woman] forever [viz. Deuteronomy 23:4].
	For they did not go out before the children of Israel with bread and water and because they hired against them Bilam to curse them [viz. Ibid. 5]. And G-d turned the curse into a blessing.
	And it was, when they heard the Torah, that they separated every admixture [of idolators] from Israel.
	And before this, Elyashiv the priest, a kinsman of Toviah [the Ammonite (viz. 2:10)], had placed [(Toviah's belongings)] in a chamber of the house of our G-d.
	And he had made him a large chamber where before they had placed the meal [for meal-offerings], the frankincense, the [Temple] vessels, the tithe of the grain, the wine, and the oil, the gifts of the Levites, the singers, and the gatekeepers, and the terumah of the priests.
	And with all this [i.e., while all this was happening], I was not in Jerusalem. For in the thirty-second year of [the reign of] Artachshast [(Darius)] king of Bavel, I came to the king, and after some time, I asked the king [to permit me to return to Jerusalem].
	And I came to Jerusalem and I realized the evil that Elyashiv had done with Toviah, giving him a chamber in the courts of the house of G-d.
	And it grieved me greatly, and I threw all the vessels of Toviah's house out of the chamber.
	And I ordered that the chambers be purified, and I restored there all the vessels of the house of G-d and the meal and the frankincense.
	And I knew that the portions of the Levites had not been placed (there), wherefore each one ran to his field [i.e., to the fields instead of to the chambers to collect his gifts] — the Levites, the singers, the doers of the work [of the Temple].
	And I fought with the officers and said: Why is the house of G-d forsaken [of priests and Levites, seeking their gifts abroad!]. And I gathered them [the priests and the Levites] and I restored them to their [usual] stations [in the Temple], whither Israel again brought their gifts as in the past].
	And all of Judah brought the tithe of grain, wine and oil to the [Temple] storehouses.
	And I placed over the storehouses Shelemyah the priest and Tzaddok the scribe and Pedayah of the Levites, and, assisting them, Chanan the son of Zakkur the son of Matanyah. For they could be trusted to divide [the gifts equably] among their brethren.
	Remember me, my G-d, for this, and do not erase my lovingkindnesses which I have done in the house of my G-d and in its watches.
	In those days I saw [men] in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath and bringing sheaves and loading them on asses, along with wine, grapes, figs and all [other] burdens, and bringing (them) to Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. And I exhorted [them against this] on their market day.
	And the Tyrian [merchants] who dwelt there brought fish and all [kinds of] merchandise and sold it on the Sabbath to the children of Judah and in Jerusalem!
	And I fought with the nobles of Judah and said to them: What is this evil thing that you are doing, desecrating the Sabbath day!
	Did your fathers not do thus and G-d bring all this evil upon us and upon this city! And you are increasing wrath against Israel by desecrating the Sabbath!
	And it was, as the shadows [were descending upon] the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I ordered that the doors be closed [(so that merchants not enter the city to sell their wares on the Sabbath)], and I ordered that they not be opened until after the Sabbath. And I posted some of my youths at the gates so that no loads enter (there) on the Sabbath day.
	And the merchants and the sellers of all wares slept outside of Jerusalem one or two times [(so that the Jews would open the gates for them and buy from them on the Sabbath)].
	And I warned them, saying: Why do you sleep near the wall? If you do this again, I will punish you! From that time on they did not come on the Sabbath.
	And I charged the Levites [(of the incoming watch)] to purify themselves and come to guard the gates [(before the onset of the Sabbath)] to sanctify the Sabbath day. This, too, remember unto me, my G-d, and be compassionate to me in the abundance of Your lovingkindness.
	Also, in those days, I saw the Jews taking as wives women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moav.
	And, of their children, half [i.e., many] spoke Ashdodian and could not speak the language of Judah, as the language of (all) people.
	And I fought with them and I cursed them and I flogged some of the men and tore out their hair, and I beswore them: If you give your daughters to their sons and if you take their daughters as wives for your sons or for yourselves …
	Did not Solomon king of Israel sin over these [women]? And in (all of) the many nations there was no king such as he. And he was beloved of his G-d. And G-d had made him king over all of Israel — he, too, was caused to sin by foreign wives!
	[And you would take such wives] unto yourselves! Is [such a thing] heard of? To do all of this great evil? To be faithless to our G-d by wedding foreign wives!
	And one of the sons of Yoyada the son of Elyashiv, the high-priest, was a son-in-law to Sanvalat the Choronite [(the oppressor of the Jews [viz. 2:10])], and I drove him away from my presence [(so that he not act as a spy for his father-in-law against Jerusalem)].
	Remember unto them [(Israel) the good that they did)] in rejecting [(the unqualified from)] the priesthood and (from) the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites [viz. 7:64].
	And I cleansed them from all foreign [elements] and I set up watches for the priests and the Levites, each in his function.
	And [I instituted] the bringing of wood [for the altar] at set times, and, [likewise] for the [bringing of] first-fruits. Remember [these things] unto me for good, my G-d.
