Ecclesiastes



Chapter 1


Genesis 4:2 "Hevel"  - Robert Alter translates "hevel" as breath or vapor, something utterly insubstantial and transient, aptly applied to the short life of Hevel, only the forth human in Creation ( after Adam, Eve, and Cain), his life cut short by murder by a brother, his fleeting life span.
