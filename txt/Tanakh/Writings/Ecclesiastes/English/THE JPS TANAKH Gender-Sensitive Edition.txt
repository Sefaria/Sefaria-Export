Ecclesiastes



Chapter 1

The words of Koheleth<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Koheleth </b>Probably “the Assembler,” namely of hearers or of sayings; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 12:9-11" href="Ecclesiastes.12.9-11">12.9–11</a>.</i> son of David, king in Jerusalem.
<span class="poetry indentAll">Utter futility!—said Koheleth—</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Utter futility! All is futile!</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">What real value is there for humankind</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">In all the gains<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote"><b>gains </b>So Rashbam.

<span class="poetry indentAll">One generation goes, another comes,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">But the earth remains the same forever.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The sun rises, and the sun sets—</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And glides<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote"><b>glides </b>So Targum; cf. Bereshith Rabbah on <a class="refLink" data-ref="Genesis 1:17" href="Genesis.1.17">Gen. 1.17</a>.</i> back to where it rises.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Southward blowing,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Turning northward,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Ever turning blows the wind;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">On its rounds the wind returns.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">All streams flow into the sea,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Yet the sea is never full;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">To the place [from] which they flow</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">The streams flow back again.<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote"><b>flow back again </b>According to popular belief, through tunnels; so Targum and Rashi.</i> </span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">All such things are wearisome:</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">No one can ever state them;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">The eye never has enough of seeing,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Nor the ear enough of hearing.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Only that shall happen</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">That has happened,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Only that occur</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">That has occurred;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">There is nothing new</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Beneath the sun!</span>
Sometimes there is a phenomenon of which they say, “Look, this one is new!”—it occurred long since, in ages that went by before us. 
The earlier ones are not remembered; so too those that will occur later will no more be remembered than<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote"><b>will no more be remembered than </b>Lit. “will not be remembered like…” For <i>ʻim</i> meaning “like,” cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 2:16" href="Ecclesiastes.2.16">2.16</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 7:11" href="Ecclesiastes.7.11">7.11</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Job 9:26" href="Job.9.26">Job 9.26</a>.</i> those that will occur at the very end.
I, Koheleth, was king in Jerusalem over Israel. 
I set my mind to study and to probe with wisdom all that happens under the sun.—An unhappy business, that, which God gave mortals to be concerned with! 
I observed all the happenings beneath the sun, and I found that all is futile and pursuit<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote"><b>pursuit </b>Lit. “tending,” from root <i>rʻh</i>, “to shepherd.”</i> of wind:
<span class="poetry indentAll">A twisted thing that cannot be made straight,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">A lack that cannot be made good.</span>
I said to myself: “Here I have grown richer and wiser than any who ruled before me over Jerusalem, and my mind has zealously absorbed wisdom and learning.” 
And so I set my mind to appraise wisdom and to appraise madness and folly. And I learned—that this too was pursuit of wind:
<span class="poetry indentAll">For as wisdom grows, vexation grows;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">To increase learning is to increase heartache.</span>

Chapter 2

I said to myself, “Come, I will treat you to merriment. Taste mirth!” That too, I found, was futile.
<span class="poetry indentAll">Of revelry I said, “It’s mad!”</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Of merriment, “What good is that?”</span>
I ventured to tempt my flesh with wine, and to grasp folly, while letting my mind direct with wisdom, to the end that I might learn which of the two was better for mortals to practice in their few days of life under heaven. 
I multiplied my possessions. I built myself houses and I planted vineyards.
I laid out gardens and groves, in which I planted every kind of fruit tree. 
I constructed pools of water, enough to irrigate a forest shooting up with trees. 
I bought male and female slaves, and I acquired stewards. I also acquired more cattle, both herds and flocks, than all who were before me in Jerusalem. 
I further amassed silver and gold and treasures of kings and provinces; and I got myself male and female singers, as well as the luxuries of commoners—coffers<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote"><b>coffers </b>The Heb. <i>shiddah</i> occurs only here in the Bible; in the Mishnah it designates a kind of chest.</i> and coffers of them. 
Thus, I gained more wealth than anyone before me in Jerusalem. In addition, my wisdom remained with me: 
I withheld from my eyes nothing they asked for, and denied myself no enjoyment; rather, I got enjoyment out of<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote"><b>out of </b>Septuagint and a few Heb. manuscripts have “(in exchange) for”; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 2:24" href="Ecclesiastes.2.24">2.24</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 3:13" href="Ecclesiastes.3.13">3.13</a>, <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 3:22" href="Ecclesiastes.3.22">22</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 5:17" href="Ecclesiastes.5.17">5.17</a>.</i> all my wealth. And that was all I got out of my wealth.
Then my thoughts turned to all the fortune my hands had built up, to the wealth I had acquired and won—and oh, it was all futile and pursuit of wind; there was no real value under the sun! 
<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Sentences transposed for clarity.</i> For what will the man be like who will succeed the one who is ruling<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote"><b>the one who is ruling </b>Change of vocalization yields “me, and who is to rule”; cf. vv. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 2:18-19" href="Ecclesiastes.2.18-19">18–19</a>.</i> over what was built up long ago?<br>My thoughts also turned to appraising wisdom and madness and folly. 
I found that<br><span class="poetry indentAll">Wisdom is superior to folly</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">As light is superior to darkness;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The wise have their eyes in their head,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Whereas fools walk in darkness.</span><br>But I also realized that the same fate awaits them all. 
So I reflected: “The fate of the fool is also destined for me; to what advantage, then, have I been wise?” And I came to the conclusion that that too was futile, 
because the wise, just like<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote"><b>like </b>See note at <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 1:11" href="Ecclesiastes.1.11">1.11</a>.</i> the foolish, are not remembered forever; for, as the succeeding days roll by, both are forgotten. Alas, the wise die, just like<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote"><b>like </b>See note at <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 1:11" href="Ecclesiastes.1.11">1.11</a>.</i> the foolish!
And so I loathed life. For I was distressed by all that goes on under the sun, because everything is futile and pursuit of wind.
So, too, I loathed all the wealth that I was gaining under the sun. For I shall leave it to the man who will succeed me— 
and who knows whether he will be wise or foolish?—and he will control all the wealth that I gained by toil and wisdom under the sun. That too is futile.
And so I came to view with despair all the gains I had made under the sun.
For sometimes a person whose fortune was made with wisdom, knowledge, and skill must hand it on to be the portion of somebody who did not toil for it. That too is futile, and a grave evil. 
For what do mortals get for all the toiling and worrying they do under the sun?
All their days their thoughts are grief and heartache, and even at night their mind has no respite. That too is futile!
There is nothing worthwhile for mortals but to eat and drink and afford themselves enjoyment with their means. And even that, I noted, comes from God. 
For who eats and who enjoys but myself?<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote"><b>myself </b>Some mss. and ancient versions read <i>mimmennu</i>, “by God’s doing.”</i> 
One, namely, who pleases [God] is given the wisdom and shrewdness for enjoyment;<sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote"><b>the wisdom and shrewdness for enjoyment </b>Lit. “wisdom and knowledge and enjoyment.”</i> while one who displeases is given the urge to gather and amass—only for handing on to someone who is pleasing to God. That too is futile and pursuit of wind.

Chapter 3

<span class="poetry indentAll">A season is set for everything, a time for every experience under heaven:<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., all human experiences are preordained by God; see v. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 3:11" href="Ecclesiastes.3.11">11</a>.</i> </span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A time for birthing and a time for dying,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">A time for planting and a time for uprooting the planted;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A time for slaying and a time for healing,<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote"><b>slaying…healing </b>Emendation yields “wrecking…repairing”; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="I Kings 18:30" href="I_Kings.18.30">1 Kings 18.30</a>.</i> </span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">A time for tearing down and a time for building up;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A time for weeping and a time for laughing,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">A time for wailing and a time for dancing;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A time for throwing stones and a time for gathering stones,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">A time for embracing and a time for shunning embraces;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A time for seeking and a time for losing,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">A time for keeping and a time for discarding;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A time for ripping and a time for sewing,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">A time for silence and a time for speaking;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A time for loving and a time for hating;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">A time for war and a time for peace.</span>
What value, then, can those who labor get from what they earn? 
I have observed the business that God gave humankind to be concerned with:
[God] brings everything to pass precisely at its time; [God] also puts eternity in their mind,<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote"><b>puts eternity in their mind </b>I.e., God preoccupies humankind with the attempt to discover the times of future events; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 8:17" href="Ecclesiastes.8.17">8.17</a>.</i> but without people ever guessing, from first to last, all the things that God brings to pass. 
Thus I realized that the only worthwhile thing there is for them is to enjoy themselves and do what is good<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote"><b>what is good </b>I.e., what the author has already concluded (<a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 2:24" href="Ecclesiastes.2.24">2.24</a>) is good.</i> in their lifetime; 
also, that whenever people do eat and drink and get enjoyment out of all their wealth, it is a gift of God.
I realized, too, that whatever God has brought to pass will recur evermore:<br><span class="poetry indentAll">Nothing can be added to it</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And nothing taken from it—</span><br>and God has brought to pass that mortals feel reverence.
<span class="poetry indentAll"><sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of parts of verse uncertain.</i> What is occurring occurred long since,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And what is to occur occurred long since:</span><br>and God seeks the pursued.
And, indeed, I have observed under the sun:<br><span class="poetry indentAll">Alongside justice there is wickedness,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Alongside righteousness there is wickedness.</span>
I mused: “God will doom both righteous and wicked, for there is<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote"><b>there is </b>Shift of a diacritical point yields “[God] has set.”</i> a time for every experience and for every happening.” 
<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of parts of verse uncertain.</i> So I decided, as regards human beings, to dissociate them [from] the divine beings and to face the fact that they are animals.<sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote">Contrast <a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 8:5-6" href="Psalms.8.5-6">Ps. 8.5–6</a>.</i> 
For in respect of the fate of humans and the fate of animals, they have one and the same fate: as the one dies so dies the other, and both have the same lifebreath; humans have no superiority over animals, since both amount to nothing. 
Both go to the same place; both came from dust and both return to dust.
Who knows if the lifebreath of humans does rise upward and if the breath of animals does sink down into the earth?
I saw that there is nothing better for people than to enjoy their possessions, since that is their portion. For who can enable them to see what will happen afterward?

Chapter 4

I further observed<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote"><b>further observed </b>Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 3:16" href="Ecclesiastes.3.16">3.16</a>.</i> all the oppression that goes on under the sun: the tears of the oppressed, with none to comfort them; and their oppressors’ power, with none to comfort them. 
Then I accounted those who died long since more fortunate than those who are still living;
and happier than either are those who have not yet come into being and have never witnessed the miseries that go on under the sun.
I have also noted that all labor and skillful enterprise come from people’s envy of one another—another futility and pursuit of wind!
[True,]<br><span class="poetry indentAll">Fools fold their hands together<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote"><b>fold their hands together </b>I.e., do not work; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Proverbs 6:10" href="Proverbs.6.10">Prov. 6.10</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Proverbs 24:33" href="Proverbs.24.33">24.33</a>.</i> </span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And have to eat their own flesh.</span>
[But no less truly,]<br><span class="poetry indentAll">Better is a handful of gratification</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Than two fistfuls of labor that is pursuit of wind.</span>
And I have noted this further futility under the sun:
the case of a man who is alone, with no companion, who has neither son nor brother; yet he amasses wealth without limit, and his eye is never sated with riches. For whom, now, is he amassing it while denying himself<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote"><b>is he amassing it while denying himself </b>Lit. “am I amassing … myself.”</i> enjoyment? That too is a futility and an unhappy business.
<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">This section consists of a series of observations, each of which is introduced by some slight association with what precedes. The theme of <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 4:4-8" href="Ecclesiastes.4.4-8">4.4–8</a> is resumed with <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 5:9" href="Ecclesiastes.5.9">5.9</a>.</i> Two are better off than one, in that they have greater benefit from<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote"><b>benefit from </b>Emendation yields “hope for”; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 2:20" href="Ecclesiastes.2.20">2.20</a>.</i> their earnings. 
For should they fall, one can raise the other; but woe to someone who is alone and falls with no companion to assist! 
Further, when two lie together they are warm; but how can someone who is alone get warm? 
Also, if someone attacks, two can withstand it. A threefold cord is not readily broken!
Better a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer has the sense to heed warnings.
For the former can emerge from a dungeon to become king; while the latter, even if born to kingship, can become a pauper.<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote"><b>become a pauper </b>Taking <i>rash</i> as a verb; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 34:11" href="Psalms.34.11">Ps. 34.11</a>.</i> 
[However,] I reflected about all the living who walk under the sun with<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote"><b>who walk under the sun with </b>I.e., are contemporaries of.</i> that youthful successor<sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote"><b>that youthful successor </b>Or: “the next youngster,” i.e., whoever comes in line to displace the youth mentioned in v. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 4:13" href="Ecclesiastes.4.13">13</a>.</i> who steps into his place. 
Unnumbered are the multitudes of all those who preceded them;<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote"><b>those who preceded them </b>And so never heard of the gifted youth.</i> and later generations will not acclaim him either.<sup class="footnote-marker">j</sup><i class="footnote"><b>later generations will not acclaim him either </b>For despite his wisdom, he too will be forgotten; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 2:16" href="Ecclesiastes.2.16">2.16</a>.</i> For that<sup class="footnote-marker">k</sup><i class="footnote"><b>that </b>Namely, the advantage of wisdom over folly.</i> too is futile and pursuit of wind.
Be not overeager to go<sup class="footnote-marker">l</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Be not overeager to go </b>Lit. “Guard your foot when it [or, you] would go.”</i> to the House of God: more acceptable is obedience than the offering of fools, for they know nothing [but] to do wrong.

Chapter 5

Keep your mouth from being rash, and let not your throat<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote"><b>throat </b>Heb. <i>leb</i>, lit. “heart,” sometimes designates the organ of speech; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Isaiah 33:18" href="Isaiah.33.18">Isa. 33.18</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Isaiah 59:13" href="Isaiah.59.13">59.13</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 19:15" href="Psalms.19.15">Ps. 19.15</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 49:4" href="Psalms.49.4">49.4</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Job 8:10" href="Job.8.10">Job 8.10</a>.</i> be quick to bring forth speech before God. For God is in heaven and you are on earth; that is why your words should be few. 
Just as dreams come with much brooding, so does foolish utterance come with much speech. 
When you make a vow to God, do not delay to fulfill it. For [God] has no pleasure in fools; what you vow, fulfill. 
It is better not to vow at all than to vow and not fulfill.
Don’t let your mouth bring you into disfavor, and don’t plead before the messenger<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote"><b>the messenger </b>Some ancient versions read “God.”</i> that it was an error, but fear God;<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote"><b>but fear God </b>Moved up from v. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 5:6" href="Ecclesiastes.5.6">6</a> for clarity.</i> else God may be angered by your talk and destroy your possessions. 
<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of verse uncertain. Emendation yields “Much brooding results in dreams; and much talk in futilities”; cf. v. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 5:2" href="Ecclesiastes.5.2">2</a>.</i> For much dreaming leads to futility and to superfluous talk.
If you see in a province oppression of the poor and suppression of right and justice, don’t wonder at the fact; for one high official is protected by a higher one, and both of them by still higher ones. 
Thus the greatest advantage in all the land is his: he controls a field that is cultivated.<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the high official profits from the labor of others; but meaning of verse uncertain.</i> 
A lover of money is never satisfied with money, nor a lover of wealth, with income. That too is futile. 
As one’s substance increases, so do those who consume it; what, then, does the success of its owner amount to but feasting the eyes? 
Workers’<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote"><b>workers’ </b>Some ancient versions have “slaves’.”</i> sleep is sweet, whether they have much or little to eat; but the abundance of the rich doesn’t let them sleep.
Here is a grave evil I have observed under the sun: riches hoarded to the detriment of the owners, 
in that those riches are lost in some unlucky venture; and if they produce children, they have nothing in hand.
Another grave evil is this: The rich<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote"><b>The rich </b>Heb. “He.”</i> must depart just as they came.<sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Another grave evil is this: The rich must depart just as they came </b>Moved up from v. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 5:15" href="Ecclesiastes.5.15">15</a> for clarity.</i> As they came out of their mother’s womb, so must they depart at last, naked as they came. They can take nothing of their wealth to carry with them. 
So what is the good of their toiling for the wind?
Besides, all their days they eat in darkness,<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote"><b>they eat in darkness </b>Septuagint reads “are [spent] in darkness and mourning.”</i> with much vexation and grief and anger.
Only this, I have found, is a real good: to eat and drink and get pleasure with all the gains you make under the sun, during the numbered days of life that God has given you; for that is your portion. 
Also, whenever people are given riches and property by God, and they are also permitted to enjoy them and to take their portion and get pleasure for their gains—that is a gift of God. 
For [such people] will not brood much over the days of their life,<sup class="footnote-marker">j</sup><i class="footnote"><b>the days of their life </b>The thought of which is depressing; see v. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 5:16" href="Ecclesiastes.5.16">16</a>.</i> because God keeps them busy enjoying themselves.

Chapter 6

There is an evil I have observed under the sun, and a grave one it is for mortals: 
that God sometimes grants a man riches, property, and wealth, so that he does not want for anything his appetite may crave, but God does not permit him to enjoy it; instead, a stranger will enjoy it. That is futility and a grievous ill. 
Even if a man should beget a hundred children and live many years—no matter how many the days of his years may come to, if his gullet is not sated through his wealth, I say: The stillbirth, though it was not even accorded a burial,<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote"><b>not even accorded a burial </b>Stillbirths were cast into pits or hidden in the ground in no recognizable graves; cf. v. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 6:4" href="Ecclesiastes.6.4">4</a> end.</i> is more fortunate than he. 
Though it comes into futility and departs into darkness, and its very name is covered with darkness, 
though it has never seen or experienced the sun, it is better off than he— 
yes, even if the other lived a thousand years twice over but never had his fill of enjoyment! For are not both of them bound for the same place? 
<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Proverbs 16:26" href="Proverbs.16.26">Prov. 16.26</a>.</i> All of a person’s earning is for [filling] the mouth, yet the gullet is not sated. 
What advantage then have the wise over the foolish, what advantage have paupers who know how to get on in life?<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote"><b>yet the gullet is not sated. What advantage then have the wise over the foolish, what advantage have paupers who know how to get on in life? </b>Meaning of Heb. uncertain; emendation yields “And if the gullet is not sated, <sup>8</sup>what advantage have the wise over fools, those who know how to get on in life over paupers?”</i> 
<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of first half of verse uncertain.</i> Is the feasting of the eyes more important than the pursuit of desire? That, too, is futility and pursuit of wind.
Whatever happens, it was designated long ago and it was known that it would happen; as for humankind, they cannot contend with the One who is stronger than they are. 
Often, much talk means much futility. How does it benefit a person? 
Who can possibly know what is best for people to do in life—the few days of this fleeting life? For<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote"><b>For </b>Lit. “according to the shadow that”; cf. Qumran Aramaic <i>beṭel</i> and Syriac <i>meṭṭol</i>; and see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 8:13" href="Ecclesiastes.8.13">8.13</a>.</i> who can tell what the future holds for them under the sun?

Chapter 7

<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">The author now offers a number of practical maxims, which, however, he concludes (vv. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 7:23-24" href="Ecclesiastes.7.23-24">23–24</a>) are of limited value.</i> A good name is better than fragrant oil, and the day of death than the day of birth.<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Until the moment of death, people risk forfeiting their good name.</i> 
It is better to go to a house of mourning than to a house of feasting; for that is the end of every mortal, and the living should take it to heart.
Vexation is better than revelry;<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">For empty revelry precludes real happiness; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 2:2" href="Ecclesiastes.2.2">2.2</a>.</i> for though the face be sad, the heart may be glad. 
The wise are drawn to a house of mourning, and the foolish to a house of merrymaking.
It is better to listen to the reproof of someone wise than to listen to the praise of fools.
For the levity<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote"><b>levity </b>Emendation yields “praise” (<i>shbḥ</i>).</i> of the fool is like the crackling of nettles under a kettle.<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">This section, to end of v. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 7:7" href="Ecclesiastes.7.7">7</a>, is apparently a continuation of the thought in vv. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 7:11-12" href="Ecclesiastes.7.11-12">11–12</a> and <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 7:19" href="Ecclesiastes.7.19">19</a>.</i> But that too is illusory;

<span class="poetry indentAll">The end of a matter is better than the beginning of it.</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Better a patient spirit than a haughty spirit.</span>
Don’t let your spirit be quickly vexed, for vexation abides in the breasts of fools.
Don’t say, “How has it happened that former times were better than these?” For it is not wise of you to ask that question.
Wisdom is as good as a patrimony, and even better, for those who behold the sun. 
For to be in the shelter of wisdom is to be also in the shelter of money,<sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote"><b>For to be in the shelter of wisdom is to be also in the shelter of money </b>Emendation yields “For the possessor of wisdom becomes a possessor of money.”</i> and the advantage of intelligence is that wisdom preserves the life of the one who possesses it.
<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">These verses continue the thought of v. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 7:10" href="Ecclesiastes.7.10">10</a>.</i> Consider God’s doing! Who can straighten what has been twisted?

In my own brief span of life, I have seen both these things: sometimes someone good perishes despite their goodness, and sometimes someone wicked endures despite their wickedness. 
So don’t overdo goodness and don’t act too wise, or you may be dumfounded. 
Don’t overdo wickedness and don’t be a fool, or you may die before your time. 
It is best that you grasp the one without letting go of the other, for those who fear God will do their duty<sup class="footnote-marker">k</sup><i class="footnote"><b>do their duty </b>Cf. postbiblical <i>yaṣaʼ yede</i>.</i> by both.

[The secret of] what happens is elusive and deep, deep down; who can discover it? 
I put my mind to studying, exploring, and seeking wisdom and the reason of things, and to studying wickedness, stupidity, madness, and folly. 
Now, I find more bitter than death the woman who is all traps, whose hands are fetters, and whose heart<sup class="footnote-marker">q</sup><i class="footnote"><b>I find more bitter than death the woman who…whose hands…whose heart </b>Or “I find woman more bitter than death; she…her hands…her heart.” Force of Heb. uncertain.</i> is snares.

See, this is what I found, said Koheleth, item by item in my search for the reason of things. 
As for what I sought further but did not find: I found only one [true] human being in a thousand, and among all these I did not find a [truly compatible] woman. 
But, see, this I did find:<sup class="footnote-marker">r</sup><i class="footnote"><b>among all these … this I did find </b>Force of Heb. uncertain.</i> God made human beings plain, but they have engaged in too much reasoning.

Indeed, what is to happen is unknown; even when it is on the point of happening, who can tell? 
No one has authority over the lifebreath—to hold back the lifebreath;<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote"><b>hold back the lifebreath </b>From leaving the body when the time comes; see <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 12:7" href="Ecclesiastes.12.7">12.7</a>; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 104:29" href="Psalms.104.29">Ps. 104.29</a>; <a class="refLink" data-ref="Psalms 146:4" href="Psalms.146.4">146.4</a>.</i> there is no authority over the day of death.

All these things I observed; I noted all that went on under the sun, while people still had authority over others to treat them unjustly. 
And then I saw scoundrels coming from the Holy Site and being brought to burial,<sup class="footnote-marker">k</sup><i class="footnote"><b>coming from the Holy Site and being brought to burial </b>Meaning uncertain; emendation yields “approaching [to minister]. They would come and profane the Holy Site.”</i> while such as had acted righteously were forgotten in the city.<br>And here is another frustration: 
the fact that the sentence imposed for evil deeds is not executed swiftly, which is why people are emboldened to do evil— 
the fact that sinners may do evil a hundred times and their [punishment] still be delayed. For although I am aware that “It will be well with those who revere God since they show reverence, 
and it will not be well with scoundrels, and they will not live long, because<sup class="footnote-marker">l</sup><i class="footnote"><b>because </b>See note at <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 6:12" href="Ecclesiastes.6.12">6.12</a>.</i> they do not revere God”— 
here is a frustration that occurs in the world: sometimes someone upright is requited according to the conduct of the scoundrel; and sometimes the scoundrel is requited according to the conduct of the upright. I say all that is frustration.
I therefore praised enjoyment. For the only good people can have under the sun is to eat and drink and enjoy themselves. That much can accompany them, in exchange for their wealth, through the days of life that God has granted them under the sun.
For I have set my mind to learn wisdom and to observe the business that goes on in the world—even to the extent of going without sleep day and night—
and I have observed all that God brings to pass. Indeed, human beings cannot guess the events that occur under the sun. For humans try strenuously, but fail to guess them; and even if those who are wise should think to discover them they would not be able to guess them.

Chapter 9

That is the sad thing about all that goes on under the sun: that the same fate is in store for all. (Not only that, but people’s hearts are full of sadness, and their minds of madness, while they live; and then—to the dead!) 
For one who is reckoned among<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote"><b>reckoned among </b>Lit. “joined to all.”</i> the living has something to look forward to—even a live dog is better than a dead lion— 
since the living know they will die. But the dead know nothing; they have no more recompense,<sup class="footnote-marker">h</sup><i class="footnote"><b>recompense </b>Emendation yields “hope.”</i> for even the memory of them has died. 
Their loves, their hates, their jealousies have long since perished; and they have no more share till the end of time in all that goes on under the sun.

Let your clothes always be freshly washed, and your head never lack ointment. 
Enjoy happiness with a woman you love all the fleeting days of life that have been granted to you under the sun—all your fleeting days. For that alone is what you can get out of life and out of the means you acquire under the sun.
Whatever it is in your power to do, do with all your might. For there is no action, no reasoning, no learning, no wisdom in Sheol, where you are going.
I have further observed under the sun that<br><span class="poetry indentAll">The race is not won by the swift,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Nor the battle by the valiant;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Nor is bread won by the wise,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Nor wealth by the intelligent,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Nor favor by the learned.</span><br>For the time of mischance<sup class="footnote-marker">j</sup><i class="footnote"><b>time of mischance </b>Euphemism for death.</i> comes to all.<sup class="footnote-marker">k</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the insignificant duration of life renders all successes illusory; cf. <a class="refLink" data-ref="Ecclesiastes 4:15-16" href="Ecclesiastes.4.15-16">4.15–16</a>.</i>
And human beings cannot even know their time. As fishes are enmeshed in a fatal net, and as birds are trapped in a snare, so humans are caught at the time of calamity,<sup class="footnote-marker">l</sup><i class="footnote"><b>time of calamity </b>Euphemism for death.</i> when it comes upon them without warning.
This thing too I observed under the sun about wisdom, and it affected me profoundly. 
There was a little city, with few men<sup class="footnote-marker">m</sup><i class="footnote"><b>men </b>I.e., potential defenders.</i> in it; and to it came a great king, who invested it and built mighty siege works against it. 
Present in the city was a poor wise man who might have saved<sup class="footnote-marker">n</sup><i class="footnote"><b>who might have saved </b>Or “and it was he who saved.”</i> it with his wisdom, but nobody thought of<sup class="footnote-marker">o</sup><i class="footnote"><b>thought of </b>Or “remembered.”</i> that poor man. 
So I observed: Wisdom is better than valor; but<br><span class="poetry indentAll">The wisdom of the poor is scorned,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And their words are not heeded.</span>
<sup class="footnote-marker">p</sup><i class="footnote">These verses constitute a group of loosely connected aphorisms.</i> Words spoken softly by wise men are heeded sooner than those shouted by a lord in folly.<sup class="footnote-marker">q</sup><i class="footnote"><b>sooner than those shouted by a lord in folly </b>Lit. “than the scream of a lord in [the manner of] the fools.”</i> 
Wisdom is more valuable than weapons of war,<sup class="footnote-marker">r</sup><i class="footnote"><b>weapons of war </b>Emendation yields “everything precious.”</i> but a single error destroys much of value.
