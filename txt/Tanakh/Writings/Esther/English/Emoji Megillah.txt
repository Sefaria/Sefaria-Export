Chapter 1

Now it came to pass in the days of 🤴🏽, (this is 🤴🏽 who reigned, from 🇮🇳 as far as 🇪🇹, a 💯 and twenty 7️⃣ provinces)
that in those days, when the king 🤴🏽 sat on the 💺 of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the 🏛️,
in the 3️⃣ year of his reign, he made a 🎉 for all his princes and his servants; the military power of Paras and Maday, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:
when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, namely a 💯 and eighty days.
And when these days were fulfilled, the king made a 🎉 for all the people that were present in Shushan the 🏛️, both for great and small, 7️⃣ days, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace:
there were hangings of white, of fine cotton, and 🔵, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple on silver rods and pillars of marble: the divans were of 🏆 and silver, upon a pavement of alabaster, marble, pearl and precious stone.
And they gave them 🥂 in 🍽️ of 🏆, (the 🍽️ being diverse from 1️⃣ another,) and royal 🍷 in abundance, according to the king’s bounty.
And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his 🏠, that they should do according to every 👨🏽’s pleasure.
Also 🙅🏽‍♀️ the queen made a 🎉 for the women, in the royal 🏠 which belonged to king 🤴🏽.
On the 7️⃣ day, when the ❤️ of the king was merry with 🍷, he commanded Mehuman, Bizzeta, 😇, Bigta, and Avagta, Zetar, and Karkas, the 7️⃣ chamberlains who served in the presence of 🤴🏽 the king,
to bring 🙅🏽‍♀️ the queen before the king with the 👑 royal, to show the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.
But the queen 🙅🏽‍♀️ 🚫 to come at the king’s commandment by his chamberlains: therefore the king was very wrathful, and his anger 🔥 in him.
Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the 🕰️, (for so was the king’s manner toward all that knew law and judgment:
and the next to him was Karshena, Shetar, Admata, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memukhan, the 7️⃣ princes of Paras and Maday, who saw the king’s face, and who sat the 1️⃣ in the kingdom;)
What shall we do to the queen 🙅🏽‍♀️ according to law, because she has not performed the bidding of the king 🤴🏽 by the chamberlains?
And Memukhan answered before the kingand the princes, 🙅🏽‍♀️ the queen has not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the peoples who are in all the provinces of the king 🤴🏽.
For this deed of the queen will be made known to all the women, so as to make their husbands contemptible in their 👁️, when it shall be reported that the king 🤴🏽 commanded 🙅🏽‍♀️ the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.
And the princesses of Paras and Maday, who have heard of the deed of the queen, shall be telling of it today to all the king’s princes. Thus shall there be contempt and wrath in plenty.
If it please the king, let a royal commandment go out from him, and let it be written among the laws of Paras and Maday, so that it be not altered, that 🙅🏽‍♀️ come no more before king 🤴🏽; and let the king give her royal estate to another who is better than she.
And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his kingdom, which is great, all the wives shall give honour to their husbands, both to high and low.
And the saying 😃 the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memukhan:
for he sent 📜 into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to its 📝, and to every people after their language, that every 👨🏽 should bear rule in his own 🏠, and speak according to the language of his people.

Chapter 2

After these things, when the wrath of king 🤴🏽 was appeased, he remembered 🙅🏽‍♀️, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.
Then the king’s servants who ministered to him said, Let fair young virgins be sought for the king:
and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins to Shushan the 🏛️, to the 🏠 of the women, to the custody of Hege the king’s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their 💅 be given them:
and let the 👧🏽 who pleases the king be queen instead of 🙅🏽‍♀️. And the thing 😃 the king; and he did so.
Now in Shushan the 🏛️ there was a certain ✡️, whose name was 👳🏽‍♂️, the son of Ya᾽ir, the son of Shim῾i, the son of Qish, a Binyaminite;
who had been exiled from Yerushalayim with the captivity which had been carried away into exile with Yekhonya king of Yehuda, whom Nevukhadneżżar the king of Bavel had carried away into exile.
And he brought up 🌿, that is, 👸🏽, his uncle’s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the 👧🏽 was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, 👳🏽‍♂️ took her for his own daughter.
So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree were heard, and when many young 👧🏽 were gathered together to Shushan the 🏛️, to the custody of 👨‍🎨, that 👸🏽 was brought also to the king’s 🏠, to the custody of 👨‍🎨, keeper of the women.
And the 👧🏽 😃 him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her 💅, and her appointed rations, and the 7️⃣ maids chosen to be given her, out of the king’s 🏠: and he advanced her and her maids to the best place in the 🏠 of the women.
👸🏽 had not made known her people or her descent: for 👳🏽‍♂️ had charged her that she should not tell.
And 👳🏽‍♂️ walked every day before the court of the women’s 🏠, to know how 👸🏽 did, and what should become of her.
Now when every 👧🏽’s turn was come to go in to king 🤴🏽, after she had been twelve 🌜 under the regulations for the women, (for so were the days of their anointing, namely, six 🌜 with oil of myrrh, and six 🌜 with sweet odours, and with other 💅 of the women;)
this is how the 👧🏽 would come to the king: whatever she desired would be given her to take with her out of the 🏠 of the women into the king’s 🏠:
in the 🌇 she would go, and on the morrow she would return to the 2️⃣ 🏠 of the women, to the custody of Sha῾ashgaz, the king’s chamberlain, who kept the concubines: she would come in to the king no more, unless the king delighted in her, and she were 🗣️ by name.
Now when the turn of 👸🏽, the daughter of Aviĥayil the uncle of 👳🏽‍♂️, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in to the king, she requested nothing but what 👨‍🎨 the king’s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And 👸🏽 obtained favour in the sight of all those who looked upon her.
So 👸🏽 was taken to king 🤴🏽 into his royal 🏠 in the 🔟 🌜, which is the 🌜 Tevet, in the 7️⃣ year of his reign.
And the king 😍 👸🏽 more than all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal 👑 upon her head, and made her queen instead of 🙅🏽‍♀️.
Then the king made a great 🎉 for all his princes and his servants, 👸🏽’s 🎉; and he granted a remission of taxes to the provinces, and gave 🎁, according to the state of the king.
And when the virgins were gathered together the 2️⃣ 🕰️, 👳🏽‍♂️ was sitting at the king’s ⛩️.
👸🏽 had not yet made known her kindred or her people; as 👳🏽‍♂️ had charged her: for 👸🏽 carried out the bidding of 👳🏽‍♂️, just as when she was brought up with him.
In those days, while 👳🏽‍♂️ sat in the king’s ⛩️, two of the king’s chamberlains, Bigtan and Teresh, of those who kept the 🚪, became disaffected, and sought to lay ✋ on the king 🤴🏽.
And the thing became known to 👳🏽‍♂️, who told it to 👸🏽 the queen; and 👸🏽 reported it to the king in 👳🏽‍♂️’s name.
And when inquiry was made of the matter, it was found out; so that they were both hanged on a 🌴: and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the presence of the king.

Chapter 3

After these things king 🤴🏽 promoted 👺 the son of Hammedata the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes who were with him.
And all the king’s servants, who were in the king’s ⛩️, 🙇🏽, and did obeisance to 👺: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But 👳🏽‍♂️ did not bow, or do him obeisance.
Then the king’s servants, who were in the king’s ⛩️, said to 👳🏽‍♂️, ⁉️ dost thou transgress the king’s commandment?
Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he did not hearken to them, that they told 👺, to see whether 👳🏽‍♂️’s words would stand: for he had told them that he was a ✡️.
And when 👺 saw that 👳🏽‍♂️ did not bow or do him obeisance, then 👺 was full of wrath.
But he disdained to lay ✋ on 👳🏽‍♂️ alone; for they had told him the people of 👳🏽‍♂️: so that 👺 sought to destroy all the ✡️ who were throughout the whole kingdom of 🤴🏽, the people of 👳🏽‍♂️.
In the 1️⃣ 🌜, that is, the 🌜 Nisan, in the twelfth year of king 🤴🏽, they cast 🗳️, that is, the lot, before 👺 from day to day, and from 🌜 to 🌜, to the twelfth 🌜, that is, the 🌜 Adar.
And 👺 said to king 🤴🏽, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are different from all people; nor do they keep the king’s laws: therefore it is of no benefit to the king to tolerate them.
If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will weigh out 🔟 thousand talents of silver into the ✋ of those who have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king’s treasuries.
And the king took his 💍 from his ✋, and gave it to 👺 the son of Hammedata the Agagite, the enemy of the ✡️.
And the king said to 👺, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seems 👍 to thee.
Then the king’s scribes were 🗣️ on the thirteenth day of the 1️⃣ 🌜, and it was written according to all that 👺 had commanded to the king’s satraps, and to the governors who were over every province, and to the rulers of every people; to every province according to its 📝, and to every people after their language; in the name of king 🤴🏽 was it written, and sealed with the king’s 💍.
And the 📜 were sent by couriers to all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate, all ✡️, both young and old, little children and women, in 1️⃣ day, namely, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth 🌜, which is the 🌜 Adar, and to take the spoil of them for plunder.
The copy of the 📝, to be given out as a law in every province, was published to all the peoples, that they might be ready for that day.
The couriers went out in haste by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the 🏛️. And the king and 👺 sat down to 🥂; but the 🏙️ of Shushan was in consternation.

Chapter 4

When 👳🏽‍♂️ perceived all that was done, 👳🏽‍♂️ rent his 👘, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the 🏙️, and cried with a 🔊 and a bitter 😭;
and came even before the king’s ⛩️: though none might enter the king’s ⛩️ clothed with sackcloth.
And in every province, wherever the king’s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the ✡️, and fasting, and 😢, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
So 👸🏽’s maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the queen exceedingly distressed; and she sent raiment to 👘 👳🏽‍♂️, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he would not accept it.
Then 👸🏽 🗣️ for Hatakh, 1️⃣ of the king’s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a message for 👳🏽‍♂️, to learn what this was, and ⁉️ it was.
So Hatakh went out to 👳🏽‍♂️, to the broad place of the 🏙️, which was before the king’s ⛩️.
And 👳🏽‍♂️ told him of all that had happened to him, and of the sum of the 💵 that 👺 had promised to 💸 to the king’s treasuries for destroying the ✡️.
Also he gave him a copy of the 📝 of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to show it to 👸🏽, and to declare it to her, and to charge her that she should go in to the king, to make supplication to him, and to entreat him for her people.
And Hatakh came and told 👸🏽 the words of 👳🏽‍♂️.
Again 👸🏽 spoke to Hatakh, and gave him a message for 👳🏽‍♂️;
All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces, do know, that whoever, whether 👨🏽 or 👩🏽, shall come to the king into the inner court, who is not 🗣️, there is 1️⃣ law for him, namely to put him to 💀, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been 🗣️ to come in to the king these thirty days.
And they told 👸🏽’s words to 👳🏽‍♂️.
Then 👳🏽‍♂️ commanded to answer 👸🏽, Do not think in thy ❤️ that thou shalt escape in the king’s 🏠 any more than all the other ✡️.
For if thou dost at all remain 🤐 at this 🕰️, then shall relief and deliverance arise to the ✡️ from elsewhere; but thou and thy father’s 🏠 shall perish: and who knows whether thou art not come to royal estate for such a 🕰️ as this?
Then 👸🏽 bade them return 👳🏽‍♂️ this answer,
Go, gather together all the ✡️ who are present in Shushan, and ⏩ for me, and neither eat nor 🥂 for three days, 🌃 and day: I also and my maidens will ⏩ likewise, and so I will go in to the king, though it is against the law: and if I perish, I perish.
So 👳🏽‍♂️ went his way, and did according to all that 👸🏽 had commanded him.

Chapter 5

Now it came to pass on the 3️⃣ day, that 👸🏽 put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king’s 🏠, over against the king’s 🏠: and the king sat upon his royal 💺 in the royal 🏠, opposite the ⛩️ of the 🏠.
And so it was, that when the king saw 👸🏽 the queen standing in the court, she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to 👸🏽 the golden sceptre that was in his ✋. So 👸🏽 drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.
Then the king said to her, What is thy wish, queen 👸🏽? and what is thy request? it shall be given thee even to half the kingdom.
And 👸🏽 answered, If it seem 👍 to the king, let the king and 👺 come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him.
Then the king said, Cause 👺 to make haste, that he may do as 👸🏽 has said. So the king and 👺 came to the banquet that 👸🏽 had prepared.
And the king said to 👸🏽 during the 🍷 drinking, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to half the kingdom it shall be performed.
Then 👸🏽 answered, and said, My petition and my request is –
if I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and 👺 come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has said.
Then 👺 went out that day joyful and with a glad ❤️: but when 👺 saw 👳🏽‍♂️ in the king’s ⛩️, that he did not stand or stir for him, he was full of 😡 against 👳🏽‍♂️.
Nevertheless 👺 restrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and 🗣️ for his friends, and 👹 his wife.
And 👺 recounted to them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.
👺 said moreover, Even 👸🏽 the queen let no 1️⃣ come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and tomorrow also I am invited to her with the king.
Yet all this avails me nothing, as long as I see 👳🏽‍♂️ the ✡️ sitting at the king’s ⛩️.
Then 👹 his wife and all his friends said to him, Let a gallows be made fifty 📏 high, and tomorrow speak to the king that 👳🏽‍♂️ may be hanged on it: then go in cheerfully with the king to the banquet. And the thing 😃 👺; and he caused the gallows to be made.

Chapter 6

On that 🌃 the king could not sleep, so he commanded the book of records of the chronicles to be brought; and they were read before the king.
And it was found written, that 👳🏽‍♂️ had told of Bigtana and Teresh, two of the king’s chamberlains, the keepers of the 🚪, who sought to lay ✋ on the king 🤴🏽.
And the king said, What honour and dignity have been done to 👳🏽‍♂️ for this? Then the king’s servants that ministered to him said, Nothing has been done for him.
And the king said, Who is in the court? Now 👺 was come into the outer court of the king’s 🏠, to speak to the king about hanging 👳🏽‍♂️ on the gallows that he had prepared for him.
And the king’s servants said to him, Behold, 👺 is standing in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.
So 👺 came in. And the king said to him, What shall be done to the 👨🏽 whom the king delights to honour? Now 👺 💭 in his ❤️, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?
And 👺 answered the king, For the 👨🏽 whom the king delights to honour,
let the royal apparel be brought which the king has worn, and the 🐴 that the king rides upon, and on the head of which a royal 👑 is placed;
and let this apparel and 🐴 be delivered to the ✋ of 1️⃣ of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array the 👨🏽 whom the king delights to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the 🏙️, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the 👨🏽 whom the king delights to honour.
Then the king said to 👺, Make haste, and take the apparel and the 🐴, as thou hast said, and do so to 👳🏽‍♂️ the ✡️, who sits at the king’s ⛩️: let nothing fail of all thou hast spoken.
Then 👺 took the apparel and the 🐴, and arrayed 👳🏽‍♂️, and brought him on horseback through the street of the 🏙️, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done to the 👨🏽 whom the king delights to honour.
And 👳🏽‍♂️ came back to the king’s ⛩️. But 👺 hastened to his 🏠 mourning, and having his head 🙈.
And 👺 told 👹 his wife and all his friends everything that had befallen him. Then his wise men and 👹 his wife said to him, If 👳🏽‍♂️, before whom thou hast begun to fall, be of the seed of the ✡️, then thou shalt not prevail against him, but thou shalt surely fall before him.
And while they were yet talking with him, the king’s chamberlains came, and brought 👺 hurriedly to the banquet that 👸🏽 had prepared.

Chapter 7

So the king and 👺 came to 🥂 with 👸🏽 the queen.
And the king said again to 👸🏽 on the 2️⃣ day at the 🍷 drinking, What is thy petition, queen 👸🏽? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed even to half the kingdom.
Then 👸🏽 the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:
for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to be annihilated. But if we had been sold merely for bondmen and bondwomen, I would have held my tongue, since the affliction would not have ⚖️ the king’s damage.
Then the king 🤴🏽 answered and said to 👸🏽 the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his ❤️ to do so?
And 👸🏽 said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked 👺. Then 👺 was struck with 😱 before the king and the queen.
And the king arising from the banquet of 🍷 in his wrath went into the palace garden: and 👺 stood up to make request for his life to 👸🏽 the queen; for he saw that 👎 was determined against him by the king.
Then the king returned out of the palace garden to the place of the 🍷 drinking; and 👺 was fallen upon the divan whereon 👸🏽 lay. Then the king said, Will he even assault the queen in my own presence in the 🏠? As the word went out of the king’s 👄, they 🙈 👺’s face.
And 😇, 1️⃣ of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty 📏 high, which 👺 has made for 👳🏽‍♂️, who had spoken 👍 for the king, stands in the 🏠 of 👺. Then the king said, Hang him on that.
So they hanged 👺 on the gallows which he had prepared for 👳🏽‍♂️. Then the king’s wrath was 😌.

Chapter 8

On that day king 🤴🏽 gave the 🏠 of 👺 the ✡️’ enemy to 👸🏽 the queen. And 👳🏽‍♂️ came before the king; for 👸🏽 had told him what he was to her.
And the king took off his 💍 which he had taken from 👺, and gave it to 👳🏽‍♂️. And 👸🏽 set 👳🏽‍♂️ over the 🏠 of 👺.
And 👸🏽 spoke once more before the king, and fell down at his 🦶, and 🙏 him with tears to avert the mischief of 👺 the Agagite, and his 🤔 that he had devised against the ✡️.
Then the king held out the golden sceptre towards 👸🏽. So 👸🏽 arose, and stood before the king,
and said, If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his 👁️, let an order be written to revoke the 📜 devised by 👺 the son of Hammedata the Agagite, which he ✍️ to destroy the ✡️ who are in all the king’s provinces:
for how can I endure to see the 👎 that shall befall my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?
Then the king 🤴🏽 said to 👸🏽 the queen and to 👳🏽‍♂️ the ✡️, Behold, I have given 👸🏽 the 🏠 of 👺, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he would lay his ✋ upon the ✡️.
Write also as you please about the ✡️ in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s 💍: but the 📝 which is already written in the king’s name, and sealed with the king’s 💍, cannot be revoked.
Then the king’s scribes were 🗣️ at that 🕰️ in the 3️⃣ 🌜, that is, the 🌜 Sivan, on the twenty 3️⃣ day of the 🌜; and an order was written, according to all that 👳🏽‍♂️ commanded, to the ✡️, and to the satraps, and the governors and princes of the provinces, from 🇮🇳 as far as 🇪🇹, a 💯 and twenty 7️⃣ provinces, to every province according to its 📝, and to every people according to their language, and to the ✡️ according to their 📝, and according to their language.
And he ✍️ in the name of king 🤴🏽, and sealed it with the king’s 💍, and sent 📜 by couriers on horseback, riding on the swift 🐴 used in the royal service, bred from the stud mares:
by these the king granted the ✡️ who were in every 🏙️ to gather themselves together, and to stand up for themselves, to destroy, to slay, and to annihilate any armed force of any people or province that might assault them, with their little ones and women, and to plunder their 👍;
on 1️⃣ day in all the provinces of king 🤴🏽, namely, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth 🌜, which is the 🌜 Adar.
The copy of the 📝 to be given out for a commandment in every province was to be published to all the peoples, and that the ✡️ should be ready by that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.
So the couriers who rode on horseback, riding on the swift 🐴 used in the royal service, went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king’s commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the 🏛️.
And 👳🏽‍♂️ went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of 🔵 and white, and with a great 👑 of 🏆, and with a wrap of fine linen and purple: and the 🏙️ of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.
The ✡️ had 🔆, and gladness, and 😄, and honour.
And in every province, and in every 🏙️, wherever the king’s commandment and his decree came, the ✡️ had 😄 and gladness, a 🎉 and a holiday. And many of the people of the land became ✡️; for the 😨 of the ✡️ fell upon them.

Chapter 9

Now in the twelfth 🌜, that is, the 🌜 Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king’s commandment and his decree drew near to be put into execution, on the day that the enemies of the ✡️ hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the ✡️ had rule over those who hated them;)
the ✡️ gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king 🤴🏽, to lay ✋ on such as sought their hurt: and no 👨🏽 could withstand them; for the 😨 of them fell upon all the peoples.
And all the rulers of the provinces, and the satraps, and the governors, and the royal officials, supported the ✡️; because the 😨 of 👳🏽‍♂️ had fallen upon them.
For 👳🏽‍♂️ was great in the king’s 🏠, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for the 👨🏽 👳🏽‍♂️ grew greater and greater.
Thus the ✡️ smote all their enemies with the stroke of the ⚔️, and with slaughter, and destruction, and did as they 😃 to those who hated them.
And in Shushan the 🏛️ the ✡️ slew and destroyed 5️⃣ 💯 men,
and they also slew
				Parshandata,and
				Dalfon,and
				Aspata,
and
				Porata,and
				Adalya,and
				Aridata,
and
				Parmashta,and
				Arisay,and
				Ariday,and
				Vayzata,
the 🔟
				sons of 👺 the son of Hammedata, the enemy of the ✡️; but they did not lay their ✋ on the plunder.
On that day the number of those who were slain in Shushan the 🏛️ was brought before the king.
And the king said to 👸🏽 the queen, The ✡️ have slain and destroyed 5️⃣ 💯 men in Shushan the 🏛️, and also the 🔟 sons of 👺; what have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what more dost thou request? and it shall be done.
Then 👸🏽 said, If it please the king, let it be granted to the ✡️ who are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according to this day’s decree, and let 👺’s 🔟 sons be hanged upon the gallows.
And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged 👺’s 🔟 sons.
For the ✡️ who were in Shushan gathered themselves together also on the fourteenth day of the 🌜 Adar, and slew three 💯 men at Shushan; but they did not lay their ✋ on the plunder.
But the other ✡️ who were in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together, and stood up for themselves, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy 5️⃣ thousand, (but they did not lay their ✋ on the plunder,)
on the thirteenth day of the 🌜 Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
But the ✡️ who were at Shushan gathered together on the thirteenth of the 🌜, and on the fourteenth of it; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
Therefore the ✡️ of the villages, who dwell in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the 🌜 Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and holiday, and of sending choice portions to 1️⃣ another.
And 👳🏽‍♂️ ✍️ these things, and sent 📜 to all the ✡️ who were in all the provinces of the king 🤴🏽, both near and far,
to enjoin upon them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the 🌜 Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, year by year,
as the days on which the ✡️ rested from their enemies, and the 🌜 which was 🙃 from 😰 to 😄, and from mourning to holiday: that they should make them days of feasting and 😄, and of sending choice portions to 1️⃣ another, and 🎁 to the poor.
And the ✡️ undertook to do as they had begun, and as 👳🏽‍♂️ had written to them;
because 👺 the son of Hammedata, the Agagite, the enemy of all the ✡️, had schemed against the ✡️ to destroy them, and had cast 🗳️, (that is, the lot,) to consume them, and to destroy them;
but when 👸🏽 came before the king, he gave orders in 📝 that his wicked 🤔, which he had devised against the ✡️, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
Therefore they 🗣️ these days Purim after the name of 🗳️. Therefore because of all the words of this 📜, and of what they had 👀 concerning this matter, and what had befallen them,
the ✡️ ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all who joined themselves to them, that they should unfailingly keep these two days according to their 📝, and according to their appointed 🕰️ every year;
and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦, every province, and every 🏙️; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the ✡️, or the memorial of them perish from their seed.
Then 👸🏽 the queen, the daughter of Aviĥayil, and 👳🏽‍♂️ the ✡️, ✍️ with all emphasis, to confirm this 2️⃣ 📜 of Purim.
And he sent 📜 to all the ✡️, to the 💯 and twenty 7️⃣ provinces of the kingdom of 🤴🏽, in words of 🕊️ and truth,
to confirm these days of Purim in their 🕰️ appointed, according as 👳🏽‍♂️ the ✡️ and 👸🏽 the queen had enjoined on them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, with regard to the fastings and the order of lamentation.
And the decree of 👸🏽 confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.

Chapter 10

And the king 🤴🏽 laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the 🏝️ of the 🌊.
And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of 👳🏽‍♂️, to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Maday and Paras?
For 👳🏽‍♂️ the ✡️ was next to king 🤴🏽, and great among the ✡️, and accepted by the multitude of his brethren, seeking the 👍 of his people, and speaking 🕊️ to all his seed.
