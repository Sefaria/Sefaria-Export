Psalms



Chapter 1

Happy is the man who has not followed the counsel of the wicked,<br>or taken the path of sinners,<br>or joined the company of the insolent;
rather, the teaching of the L<small>ORD</small> is his delight,<br>and he studies<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Or “recites”; lit. “utters.”</i> that teaching day and night.
He is like a tree planted beside streams of water,<br>which yields its fruit in season,<br>whose foliage never fades,<br>and whatever <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Or “he does prospers.”</i>it produces thrives.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
Not so the wicked;<br>rather, they are like chaff that wind blows away.
Therefore the wicked will not survive judgment,<br>nor will sinners, in the assembly of the righteous.
For the L<small>ORD</small> cherishes the way of the righteous,<br>but the way of the wicked is doomed.

Chapter 2

Why do nations assemble,<br>and peoples plot<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “utter.”</i> vain things;
kings of the earth take their stand,<br>and regents intrigue together<br>against the L<small>ORD</small> and against His anointed?
“Let us break the cords of their yoke,<br>shake off their ropes from us!”
He who is enthroned in heaven laughs;<br>the Lord mocks at them.
Then He speaks to them in anger,<br>terrifying them in His rage,
“But I have installed My king<br>on Zion, My holy mountain!”
Let me tell of the decree:<br>the L<small>ORD</small> said to me,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Compare 2 Sam. 7.14, and Ps. 89.27 ff.</i>“You are My son,<br>I have fathered you this day.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
Ask it of Me,<br>and I will make the nations your domain;<br>your estate, the limits of the earth.
You can smash them with an iron mace,<br>shatter them like potter’s ware.”<br>
So now, O kings, be prudent;<br>accept discipline, you rulers of the earth!
Serve the L<small>ORD</small> in awe;<br><sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain; others “rejoice with trembling.”</i>tremble with fright,<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup>
<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>pay homage in good faith,<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup><br>lest He be angered, and your way be doomed<br>in the mere flash of His anger.<br>Happy are all who take refuge in Him.

Chapter 3

A psalm of David when he fled from his son Absalom.<br>
O L<small>ORD</small>, my foes are so many!<br>Many are those who attack me;
many say of me,<br>“There is no deliverance for him through God.” <i>Selah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">A liturgical direction of uncertain meaning.</i>
But You, O L<small>ORD</small>, are a shield about me,<br>my glory, He who holds my head high.
I cry aloud to the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>and He answers me from His holy mountain. <i>Selah</i>.
I lie down and sleep and wake again,<br>for the L<small>ORD</small> sustains me.
I have no fear of the myriad forces<br>arrayed against me on every side.<br>
Rise, O L<small>ORD</small>!<br>Deliver me, O my God!<br>For You slap all my enemies in the face;<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “cheek.”</i><br>You break the teeth of the wicked.
Deliverance is the L<small>ORD</small>’s;<br>Your blessing be upon Your people! <i>Selah</i>.

Chapter 4

<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>For the leader; with instrumental music.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> A psalm of David.<br>
Answer me when I call,<br>O God, my vindicator!<br>You freed me from distress;<br>have mercy on me and hear my prayer.
You men, how long will my glory be mocked,<br>will you love illusions,<br>have recourse to frauds? <i>Selah</i>.
Know that the L<small>ORD</small> singles out the faithful for Himself;<br>the L<small>ORD</small> hears when I call to Him.
So tremble, and sin no more;<br>ponder it on your bed, and sigh.<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Others “be still.”</i>
Offer sacrifices in righteousness<br>and trust in the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>
Many say, “O for good days!”<br><sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “Lift up the light of Your countenance upon us”; cf. Num. 6.25 f.</i>Bestow Your favor on us,<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup> O L<small>ORD</small>.
You put joy into my heart<br>when their grain and wine show increase.
Safe and sound, I lie down and sleep,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Or “for You, O Lord, keep me alone and secure.”</i>for You alone, O L<small>ORD</small>, keep me secure.<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup>

Chapter 5

<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>For the leader; on <i>neḥiloth</i>.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> A psalm of David.<br>
Give ear to my speech, O L<small>ORD</small>;<br>consider my utterance.
Heed the sound of my cry,<br>my king and God,<br>for I pray to You.
Hear my voice, O L<small>ORD</small>, at daybreak;<br>at daybreak I plead before You, and wait.<br>
For You are not a God who desires wickedness;<br>evil cannot abide with You;
wanton men cannot endure in Your sight.<br>You detest all evildoers;
You doom those who speak lies;<br>murderous, deceitful men the L<small>ORD</small> abhors.<br>
But I, through Your abundant love, enter Your house;<br>I bow down in awe at Your holy temple.
O L<small>ORD</small>, <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Or “as You are righteous, lead me.”</i>lead me along Your righteous [path]<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>because of my watchful foes;<br>make Your way straight before me.
For there is no sincerity on their lips;<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “mouth.”</i><br>their heart is [filled with] malice;<br>their throat is an open grave;<br>their tongue slippery.
Condemn them, O God;<br>let them fall by their own devices;<br>cast them out for their many crimes,<br>for they defy You.
But let all who take refuge in You rejoice,<br>ever jubilant as You shelter them;<br>and let those who love Your name exult in You.
For You surely bless the righteous man, O L<small>ORD</small>,<br>encompassing him with favor like a shield.

Chapter 6

<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>For the leader; with instrumental music on the <i>sheminith</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> A psalm of David.<br>
O L<small>ORD</small>, do not punish me in anger,<br>do not chastise me in fury.
Have mercy on me, O L<small>ORD</small>, for I languish;<br>heal me, O L<small>ORD</small>, for my bones shake with terror.
My whole being is stricken with terror,<br>while You, L<small>ORD</small>—O, how long!
O L<small>ORD</small>, turn! Rescue me!<br>Deliver me as befits Your faithfulness.
For there is no praise of You among the dead;<br>in Sheol, who can acclaim You?<br>
I am weary with groaning;<br>every night I drench my bed,<br>I melt my couch in tears.
My eyes are wasted by vexation,<br>worn out because of all my foes.
Away from me, all you evildoers,<br>for the L<small>ORD</small> heeds the sound of my weeping.
The L<small>ORD</small> heeds my plea,<br>the L<small>ORD</small> accepts my prayer.
All my enemies will be frustrated and stricken with terror;<br>they will turn back in an instant, frustrated.

Chapter 7

<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i><i>Shiggaion</i> of David,<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> which he sang to the L<small>ORD</small>, concerning Cush, a Benjaminite.<br>
O L<small>ORD</small>, my God, in You I seek refuge;<br>deliver me from all my pursuers and save me,
lest, like a lion, they tear me apart,<br>rending in pieces, and no one save me.
O L<small>ORD</small>, my God, if I have done such things,<br>if my hands bear the guilt of wrongdoing,
if I have dealt evil to my ally—<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain; others “or stripped my foe clean.”</i>I who rescued my foe without reward<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>—
then let the enemy pursue and overtake me;<br>let him trample my life to the ground,<br>and lay my body in the dust. <i>Selah</i>.<br>
Rise, O L<small>ORD</small>, in Your anger;<br>assert Yourself <sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Or “in Your fury against my foes.”</i>against the fury of my foes;<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup><br>bestir Yourself on my behalf;<br>You have ordained judgment.
<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Let the assembly of peoples gather about You,<br>with You enthroned above, on high.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>
The L<small>ORD</small> judges the peoples;<br>vindicate me, O L<small>ORD</small>,<br>for the righteousness and blamelessness that are mine.
Let the evil of the wicked come to an end,<br>but establish the righteous;<br>he who probes the mind and conscience<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “kidneys.”</i> is God the righteous.
<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ibn Ezra and Kimhi; lit. “My Shield is upon God.”</i>I look to God to shield me;<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup><br>the deliverer of the upright.
God vindicates the righteous;<br>God <sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Others “has indignation.”</i>pronounces doom<sup class="endFootnote">-f</sup> each day.
<sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of vv. 13–14 uncertain; an alternate rendering, with God as the main subject, is: 13If one does not turn back, He whets His sword, / bends His bow and aims it; / 14deadly weapons He prepares for him, / and makes His arrows sharp.</i>If one does not turn back, but whets his sword,<br>bends his bow and aims it,
then against himself he readies deadly weapons,<br>and makes his arrows sharp.<sup class="endFootnote">-g</sup>
See, he hatches evil, conceives mischief,<br>and gives birth to fraud.
He has dug a pit and deepened it,<br>and will fall into the trap he made.
His mischief will recoil upon his own head;<br>his lawlessness will come down upon his skull.
I will praise the L<small>ORD</small> for His righteousness,<br>and sing a hymn to the name of the L<small>ORD</small> Most High.

Chapter 8

<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>For the leader; on the <i>gittith</i>.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> A psalm of David.<br>
O L<small>ORD</small>, our Lord,<br>How majestic is Your name throughout the earth,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain; or “You whose splendor is celebrated all over the heavens!”</i>You who have covered the heavens with Your splendor!<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>From the mouths of infants and sucklings<br>You have founded strength on account of Your foes,<br>to put an end to enemy and avenger.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>
When I behold Your heavens, the work of Your fingers,<br>the moon and stars that You set in place,
what is man that You have been mindful of him,<br>mortal man that You have taken note of him,
that You have made him little less than divine,<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Or “the angels.”</i><br>and adorned him with glory and majesty;
You have made him master over Your handiwork,<br>laying the world at his feet,
sheep and oxen, all of them,<br>and wild beasts, too;
the birds of the heavens, the fish of the sea,<br>whatever travels the paths of the seas.
O L<small>ORD</small>, our Lord, how majestic is Your name throughout the earth!

Chapter 9

I will rejoice and exult in You,<br>singing a hymn to Your name, O Most High.<br>
When my enemies retreat,<br>they stumble to their doom at Your presence.
For You uphold my right and claim,<br>enthroned as righteous judge.
You blast the nations;<br>You destroy the wicked;<br>You blot out their name forever.
<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>The enemy is no more—<br>ruins everlasting;<br>You have torn down their cities;<br>their very names are lost.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
But the L<small>ORD</small> abides forever;<br>He has set up His throne for judgment;
it is He who judges the world with righteousness,<br>rules the peoples with equity.
The L<small>ORD</small> is a haven for the oppressed,<br>a haven in times of trouble.
Those who know Your name trust You,<br>for You do not abandon those who turn to You, O L<small>ORD</small>.
Sing a hymn to the L<small>ORD</small>, <sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Or “O You who dwell in Zion.”</i>who reigns in Zion;<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup><br>declare His deeds among the peoples.
<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Order of Hebrew clauses inverted for clarity.</i>For He does not ignore the cry of the afflicted;<br>He who requites bloodshed is mindful of them.<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup>
Have mercy on me, O L<small>ORD</small>;<br>see my affliction at the hands of my foes,<br>You who lift me from the gates of death,
so that in the gates of <sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “the Daughter of Zion.”</i>Fair Zion<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup><br>I might tell all Your praise,<br>I might exult in Your deliverance.
The nations sink in the pit they have made;<br>their own foot is caught in the net they have hidden.
The L<small>ORD</small> has made Himself known:<br>He works judgment;<br>the wicked man is snared by his own devices. <i>Higgaion</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> <i>Selah</i>.
Let the wicked be<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">Others “return to.”</i> in Sheol,<br>all the nations who ignore God!
Not always shall the needy be ignored,<br>nor the hope of the afflicted forever lost.
Rise, O L<small>ORD</small>!<br>Let not men have power;<br>let the nations be judged in Your presence.
<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Strike fear into them,<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup> O L<small>ORD</small>;<br>let the nations know they are only men. <i>Selah</i>.

Chapter 10

Why, O L<small>ORD</small>, do You stand aloof, <br>heedless in times of trouble?
The wicked in his arrogance hounds the lowly—<br><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Or “they (i.e., the lowly) are caught by the schemes they devised.”</i>may they be caught in the schemes they devise! <sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>
<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>The wicked crows about his unbridled lusts;<br>the grasping man reviles and scorns the L<small>ORD</small>.
The wicked, arrogant as he is,<br>in all his scheming [thinks],<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>“He does not call to account;<br><sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “There is no God.”</i>God does not care.”<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup>
His ways prosper at all times;<br>Your judgments are far beyond him;<br>he snorts at all his foes.
He thinks, “I shall not be shaken,<br>through all time never be in trouble.”
His mouth is full of oaths, deceit, and fraud;<br>mischief and evil are under his tongue.
He lurks in outlying places;<br>from a covert he slays the innocent;<br>his eyes spy out the hapless.
He waits in a covert like a lion in his lair;<br>waits to seize the lowly;<br>he seizes the lowly as he pulls his net shut;
he stoops, he crouches,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>and the hapless fall prey to his might.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
He thinks, “God is not mindful,<br>He hides His face, He never looks.”
Rise, O L<small>ORD</small>!<br><sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “Lift Your hand.”</i>Strike at him,<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup> O God!<br>Do not forget the lowly.
Why should the wicked man scorn God,<br>thinking You do not call to account?
You do look!<br>You take note of mischief and vexation!<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>To requite is in Your power.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>To You the hapless can entrust himself;<br>You have ever been the orphan’s help.
O break the power of the wicked and evil man,<br>so that when You <sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">A play on darash, which in vv. 4 and 13 means “to call to account.”</i>look for<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup> his wickedness<br>You will find it no more.<br>
The L<small>ORD</small> is king for ever and ever;<br>the nations will perish from His land.
You will listen to the entreaty of the lowly, O L<small>ORD</small>,<br>You will make their hearts firm;<br>You will incline Your ear
to champion the orphan and the downtrodden,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>that men who are of the earth tyrannize no more.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>

Chapter 11

For the leader. Of David.<br><br>In the L<small>ORD</small> I take refuge;<br>how can you say to me,<br>“Take to <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain; lit. “your hill, bird!”</i>the hills like a bird!<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>
For see, the wicked bend the bow,<br>they set their arrow on the string<br>to shoot from the shadows at the upright.
<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Or “For the foundations are destroyed; what has the Righteous One done?” Or “If the foundations are destroyed, what has the righteous man accomplished?”</i>When the foundations are destroyed,<br>what can the righteous man do?”<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>
The L<small>ORD</small> is in His holy palace;<br>the L<small>ORD</small>—His throne is in heaven;<br>His eyes behold, His gaze searches mankind.
The L<small>ORD</small> seeks out the righteous man,<br>but loathes the wicked one who loves injustice.
He will rain down upon the wicked blazing coals and sulfur;<br>a scorching wind shall be <sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “the portion of their cup.”</i>their lot.<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup>
For the L<small>ORD</small> is righteous;<br>He loves righteous deeds;<br>the upright shall behold His face.

Chapter 12

For the leader; on the <i>sheminith</i>. A psalm of David.<br>
Help, O L<small>ORD</small>!<br>For the faithful are no more;<br>the loyal have vanished from among men.
Men speak lies to one another;<br>their speech is smooth;<br>they talk with duplicity.
May the L<small>ORD</small> cut off all flattering lips,<br>every tongue that speaks arrogance.
They say, “By our tongues we shall prevail;<br>with lips such as ours, who can be our master?”<br>
“Because of the groans of the plundered poor and needy,<br>I will now act,” says the L<small>ORD</small>.<br><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>“I will give help,” He affirms to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>
The words of the L<small>ORD</small> are pure words,<br>silver purged in an earthen crucible,<br>refined sevenfold.
You, O L<small>ORD</small>, will keep them,<br>guarding each <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>from this age<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> evermore.
On every side the wicked roam<br><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>when baseness is exalted among men.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>

Chapter 13

For the leader. A psalm of David.<br>
How long, O L<small>ORD</small>; will You ignore me forever?<br>How long will You hide Your face from me?
How long will I have cares on my mind,<br>grief in my heart all day?<br>How long will my enemy have the upper hand?
Look at me, answer me, O L<small>ORD</small>, my God!<br>Restore the luster to my eyes,<br>lest I sleep the sleep of death;
lest my enemy say, “I have overcome him,”<br>my foes exult when I totter.
But I trust in Your faithfulness,<br>my heart will exult in Your deliverance.<br>I will sing to the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>for He has been good to me.

Chapter 14

<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ps. 53.</i>For the leader. Of David.<br><br>The benighted man thinks,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “There is no God”; cf. Ps. 10.4.</i>“God does not care.”<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>Man’s deeds are corrupt and loathsome;<br>no one does good.
The L<small>ORD</small> looks down from heaven on mankind<br>to find a man of understanding,<br>a man mindful of God.
All have turned bad,<br>altogether foul;<br>there is none who does good,<br>not even one.
Are they so witless, all those evildoers,<br>who devour my people as they devour food,<br>and do not invoke the L<small>ORD</small>?
There they will be seized with fright,<br>for God is present in the circle of the righteous.
You may set at naught the counsel of the lowly,<br>but the L<small>ORD</small> is his refuge.<br>
O that the deliverance of Israel might come from Zion!<br>When the L<small>ORD</small> restores the fortunes of His people,<br>Jacob will exult, Israel will rejoice.

Chapter 15

A psalm of David.<br><br>L<small>ORD</small>, who may sojourn in Your tent,<br>who may dwell on Your holy mountain?
He who lives without blame,<br>who does what is right,<br>and in his heart acknowledges the truth;
<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain; or “who has no slander upon his tongue.”</i>whose tongue is not given to evil;<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br>who has never done harm to his fellow,<br>or borne reproach for [his acts toward] his neighbor;
for whom a contemptible man is abhorrent,<br>but who honors those who fear the L<small>ORD</small>;<br>who stands by his oath even to his hurt;
who has never lent money at interest,<br>or accepted a bribe against the innocent.<br>The man who acts thus shall never be shaken.

Chapter 16

A <i>michtam</i><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> of David.<br><br>Protect me, O God, for I seek refuge in You.
I say to the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>“You are my Lord, <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Others “I have no good but in You.”</i>my benefactor;<br>there is none above You.”<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain; “holy and mighty ones” taken as epithets for divine beings; cf. qedoshim in Ps. 89.6, 8, and ’addirim in 1 Sam. 4.8.</i>As to the holy and mighty ones that are in the land,<br>my whole desire concerning them is that
those who espouse another [god]<br>may have many sorrows!<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup><br>I will have no part of their bloody libations;<br>their names will not pass my lips.
The L<small>ORD</small> is my allotted share and portion;<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “cup.”</i><br>You control my fate.
Delightful country has fallen to my lot;<br>lovely indeed is my estate.
I bless the L<small>ORD</small> who has guided me;<br>my conscience<sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “kidneys.”</i> admonishes me at night.
I am ever mindful of the L<small>ORD</small>’s presence;<br>He is at my right hand; I shall never be shaken.
So my heart rejoices,<br>my whole being exults,<br>and my body rests secure.
For You will not abandon me to Sheol,<br>or let Your faithful one see the Pit.
You will teach me the path of life.<br>In Your presence is perfect joy;<br>delights are ever in Your right hand.

Chapter 17

A prayer of David.<br><br>Hear, O L<small>ORD</small>, what is just;<br>heed my cry, give ear to my prayer,<br>uttered without guile.
My vindication will come from You;<br>Your eyes will behold what is right.
You have visited me at night, probed my mind,<br>You have tested me and found nothing amiss;<br><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>I determined that my mouth should not transgress.
As for man’s dealings,<br>in accord with the command of Your lips,<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br>I have kept in view the fate<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Prov. 1.19; lit. “paths.”</i> of the lawless.
My feet have held to Your paths;<br>my legs have not given way.<br>
I call on You;<br>You will answer me, God;<br>turn Your ear to me,<br>hear what I say.
Display Your faithfulness in wondrous deeds,<br>You who deliver with Your right hand<br>those who seek refuge from assailants.
Guard me like the apple of Your eye;<br>hide me in the shadow of Your wings
from the wicked who despoil me,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Or “from my enemies who avidly.”</i>my mortal enemies who<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup> encircle me.
<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Their hearts are closed to pity;<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br>they mouth arrogance;
now they hem in our feet on every side;<br>they set their eyes roaming over the land.
He is like a lion eager for prey,<br>a king of beasts lying in wait.<br>
Rise, O L<small>ORD</small>! Go forth to meet him.<br>Bring him down;<br>rescue me from the wicked with Your sword,
<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>from men, O L<small>ORD</small>, with Your hand,<br>from men whose share in life is fleeting.<br>But as to Your treasured ones,<br>fill their bellies.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br>Their sons too shall be satisfied,<br>and have something to leave over for their young.
Then I, justified, will behold Your face;<br>awake, I am filled with the vision of You.

Let me exult and rejoice in Your faithfulness<br>when You notice my affliction,<br>are mindful of my deep distress,
and do not hand me over to my enemy,<br>but <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “make my feet stand in a broad place.”</i>grant me relief.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br>
Have mercy on me, O L<small>ORD</small>,<br>for I am in distress;<br>my eyes are wasted by vexation,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>my substance and body too.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
My life is spent in sorrow,<br>my years in groaning;<br>my strength fails because of my iniquity,<br>my limbs waste away.
Because of all my foes<br>I am the particular butt of my neighbors,<br>a horror to my friends;<br>those who see me on the street avoid me.
I am put out of mind like the dead;<br>I am like an object given up for lost.
I hear the whisperings of many,<br>intrigue<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Others “terror.”</i> on every side,<br>as they scheme together against me,<br>plotting to take my life.<br>
But I trust in You, O L<small>ORD</small>;<br>I say, “You are my God!”
My fate is in Your hand;<br>save me from the hand of my enemies and pursuers.
Show favor to Your servant;<br>as You are faithful, deliver me.
O L<small>ORD</small>, let me not be disappointed when I call You;<br>let the wicked be disappointed;<br>let them be silenced in Sheol;
let lying lips be stilled<br>that speak haughtily against the righteous<br>with arrogance and contempt.
How abundant is the good<br>that You have in store for those who fear You,<br>that You do in the full view of men<br>for those who take refuge in You.
You grant them the protection of Your presence<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>against scheming men;<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>You shelter them in Your pavilion<br>from contentious tongues.
Blessed is the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>for He has been wondrously faithful to me,<br>a veritable bastion.
Alarmed, I had thought,<br>“I am thrust out of Your sight”;<br>yet You listened to my plea for mercy<br>when I cried out to You.
So love the L<small>ORD</small>, all you faithful;<br>the L<small>ORD</small> guards the loyal,<br>and more than requites<br>him who acts arrogantly.
Be strong and of good courage,<br>all you who wait for the L<small>ORD</small>.

Chapter 32

Of David. <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>A <i>maskil</i>.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br><br>Happy is he whose transgression is forgiven,<br>whose sin is covered over.
Happy the man whom the L<small>ORD</small> does not hold guilty,<br>and in whose spirit there is no deceit.<br>
As long as I said nothing,<br>my limbs wasted away<br>from my anguished roaring all day long.
For night and day<br>Your hand lay heavy on me;<br>my vigor waned<br>as in the summer drought. <i>Selah</i>.
Then I acknowledged my sin to You;<br>I did not cover up my guilt;<br>I resolved, “I will confess my transgressions to the L<small>ORD</small>,”<br>and You forgave the guilt of my sin. <i>Selah</i>.
Therefore let every faithful man pray to You<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain; others “in a time when You may be found.”</i>upon discovering [his sin],<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>that the rushing mighty waters<br>not overtake him.
You are my shelter;<br>You preserve me from distress;<br>You surround me with the joyous shouts of deliverance. <i>Selah</i>.<br>
Let me enlighten you<br>and show you which way to go;<br>let me offer counsel; my eye is on you.
Be not like a senseless horse or mule<br><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>whose movement must be curbed by bit and bridle;<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br><sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain; for this rendering cf.

Many are the torments of the wicked,<br>but he who trusts in the L<small>ORD</small><br>shall be surrounded with favor.
Rejoice in the L<small>ORD</small> and exult, O you righteous;<br>shout for joy, all upright men!

Chapter 33

Sing forth, O you righteous, to the L<small>ORD</small>;<br>it is fit that the upright acclaim Him.
Praise the L<small>ORD</small> with the lyre;<br>with the ten-stringed harp sing to Him;
sing Him a new song;<br>play sweetly with shouts of joy.
For the word of the L<small>ORD</small> is right;<br>His every deed is faithful.
He loves what is right and just;<br>the earth is full of the L<small>ORD</small>’s faithful care.
By the word of the L<small>ORD</small> the heavens were made,<br>by the breath of His mouth, all their host.
He heaps up the ocean waters like a mound,<br>stores the deep in vaults.<br>
Let all the earth fear the L<small>ORD</small>;<br>let all the inhabitants of the world dread Him.
For He spoke, and it was;<br>He commanded, and it endured.
The L<small>ORD</small> frustrates the plans of nations,<br>brings to naught the designs of peoples.
What the L<small>ORD</small> plans endures forever,<br>what He designs, for ages on end.<br>
Happy the nation whose God is the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>the people He has chosen to be His own.
The L<small>ORD</small> looks down from heaven;<br>He sees all mankind.
From His dwelling-place He gazes<br>on all the inhabitants of the earth—
He who fashions the hearts of them all,<br>who discerns all their doings.<br>
Kings are not delivered by a large force;<br>warriors are not saved by great strength;
horses are a false hope for deliverance;<br>for all their great power they provide no escape.
Truly the eye of the L<small>ORD</small> is on those who fear Him,<br>who wait for His faithful care
to save them from death,<br>to sustain them in famine.
We set our hope on the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>He is our help and shield;
in Him our hearts rejoice,<br>for in His holy name we trust.
May we enjoy, O L<small>ORD</small>, Your faithful care,<br>as we have put our hope in You.

Chapter 34

Of David, <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. 1 Sam. 21.14 ff.</i>when he feigned madness in the presence of Abimelech, who turned him out, and he left.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br>
I bless the L<small>ORD</small> at all times;<br>praise of Him is ever in my mouth.
I glory in the L<small>ORD</small>;<br>let the lowly hear it and rejoice.
Exalt the L<small>ORD</small> with me;<br>let us extol His name together.
I turned to the L<small>ORD</small>, and He answered me;<br>He saved me from all my terrors.
Men look to Him and are radiant;<br>let their faces not be downcast.
Here was a lowly man who called,<br>and the L<small>ORD</small> listened,<br>and delivered him from all his troubles.
The angel of the L<small>ORD</small> camps around those who fear Him<br>and rescues them.
Taste and see how good the L<small>ORD</small> is;<br>happy the man who takes refuge in Him!
Fear the L<small>ORD</small>, you His consecrated ones,<br>for those who fear Him lack nothing.
Lions have been reduced to starvation,<br>but those who turn to the L<small>ORD</small> shall not lack any good.
Come, my sons, listen to me;<br>I will teach you what it is to fear the L<small>ORD</small>.
Who is the man who is eager for life,<br>who desires years of good fortune?
Guard your tongue from evil,<br>your lips from deceitful speech.
Shun evil and do good,<br>seek amity<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Or “integrity.”</i> and pursue it.
The eyes of the L<small>ORD</small> are on the righteous,<br>His ears attentive to their cry.
The face of the L<small>ORD</small> is set against evildoers,<br>to erase their names from the earth.
They<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Viz., the righteous of v. 16.</i> cry out, and the L<small>ORD</small> hears,<br>and saves them from all their troubles.
The L<small>ORD</small> is close to the brokenhearted;<br>those crushed in spirit He delivers.
Though the misfortunes of the righteous be many,<br>the L<small>ORD</small> will save him from them all,
Keeping all his bones intact,<br>not one of them being broken.
One misfortune is the deathblow of the wicked;<br>the foes of the righteous shall be ruined.
The L<small>ORD</small> redeems the life of His servants;<br>all who take refuge in Him shall not be ruined.

Chapter 35

Of David.<br><br>O L<small>ORD</small>, strive with my adversaries,<br>give battle to my foes,
take up shield and buckler,<br>and come to my defense;
ready the spear and javelin<br>against my pursuers;<br>tell me, “I am your deliverance.”
Let those who seek my life<br>be frustrated and put to shame;<br>let those who plan to harm me<br>fall back in disgrace.
Let them be as chaff in the wind,<br>the L<small>ORD</small>’s angel driving them on.
Let their path be dark and slippery,<br>with the L<small>ORD</small>’s angel in pursuit.
For without cause they hid a net to trap me;<br>without cause they dug a pit<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Transferred from first clause for clarity.</i> for me.
Let disaster overtake them unawares;<br>let the net they hid catch them;<br>let them fall into it when disaster [strikes].
Then shall I exult in the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>rejoice in His deliverance.
All my bones shall say,<br>“L<small>ORD</small>, who is like You?<br>You save the poor from one stronger than he,<br>the poor and needy from his despoiler.”<br>
Malicious witnesses appear<br>who question me about things I do not know.
They repay me evil for good,<br>[seeking] my bereavement.
Yet, when they were ill,<br>my dress was sackcloth,<br>I kept a fast—<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain; lit. “my prayer returns upon my bosom.”</i>may what I prayed for happen to me!<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
I walked about as though it were my friend or my brother;<br>I was bowed with gloom, like one mourning for his mother.
But when I stumble, they gleefully gather;<br>wretches gather against me,<br>I know not why;<br><sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>they tear at me without end.
With impious, mocking grimace<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup><br>they gnash their teeth at me.<br>
O Lord, how long will You look on?<br>Rescue me <sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>from their attacks,<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup><br>my precious life, from the lions,
that I may praise You in a great congregation,<br>acclaim You in a mighty throng.
Let not my treacherous enemies rejoice over me,<br>or those who hate me without reason wink their eyes.
For they do not offer amity,<br>but devise fraudulent schemes against harmless folk.
They open wide their mouths at me,<br>saying, “Aha, aha, we have seen it!”<br>
You have seen it, O L<small>ORD</small>;<br>do not hold aloof!<br>O Lord, be not far from me!
Wake, rouse Yourself for my cause,<br>for my claim, O my God and my Lord!
Take up my cause, O L<small>ORD</small> my God, as You are beneficent,<br>and let them not rejoice over me.
Let them not think,<br>“Aha, just what we wished!”<br>Let them not say,<br>“We have destroyed him!”
May those who rejoice at my misfortune<br>be frustrated and utterly disgraced;<br>may those who vaunt themselves over me<br>be clad in frustration and shame.
May those who desire my vindication<br>sing forth joyously;<br>may they always say,<br>“Extolled be the L<small>ORD</small><br>who desires the well-being of His servant,”
while my tongue shall recite Your beneficent acts,<br>Your praises all day long.

Chapter 36

<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “In my heart is.”</i>I know<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> what Transgression says to the wicked;<br>he has no sense of the dread of God,
<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>because its speech is seductive to him<br>till his iniquity be found out and he be hated.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
His words are evil and deceitful;<br>he will not consider doing good.
In bed he plots mischief;<br>he is set on a path of no good,<br>he does not reject evil.<br>
O L<small>ORD</small>, Your faithfulness reaches to heaven;<br>Your steadfastness to the sky;
Your beneficence is like the high mountains;<br>Your justice like the great deep;<br>man and beast You deliver, O L<small>ORD</small>.
How precious is Your faithful care, O God!<br>Mankind shelters in the shadow of Your wings.
They feast on the rich fare of Your house;<br>You let them drink at Your refreshing stream.
With You is the fountain of life;<br>by Your light do we see light.
Bestow Your faithful care on those devoted to You,<br>and Your beneficence on upright men.
Let not the foot of the arrogant tread on me,<br>or the hand of the wicked drive me away.
There lie the evildoers, fallen,<br>thrust down, unable to rise.

Chapter 37

Of David.<br><br>Do not be vexed by evil men;<br>do not be incensed by wrongdoers;
for they soon wither like grass,<br>like verdure fade away.
Trust in the L<small>ORD</small> and do good,<br>abide in the land and remain loyal.
Seek the favor of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>and He will grant you the desires of your heart.
Leave all<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “your way.”</i> to the L<small>ORD</small>;<br>trust in Him; He will do it.
He will cause your vindication to shine forth like the light,<br>the justice of your case, like the noonday sun.
Be patient and wait for the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>do not be vexed by the prospering man<br>who carries out his schemes.<br>
Give up anger, abandon fury,<br>do not be vexed;<br>it can only do harm.
For evil men will be cut off,<br>but those who look to the L<small>ORD</small>—<br>they shall inherit the land.
A little longer and there will be no wicked man;<br>you will look at where he was—<br>he will be gone.
But the lowly shall inherit the land,<br>and delight in abundant well-being.
The wicked man schemes against the righteous,<br>and gnashes his teeth at him.
The Lord laughs at him,<br>for He knows that his day will come.
The wicked draw their swords, bend their bows,<br>to bring down the lowly and needy,<br>to slaughter <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “those whose way is upright.”</i>upright men.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
Their swords shall pierce their own hearts,<br>and their bows shall be broken.
Better the little that the righteous man has<br>than the great abundance of the wicked.
For the arms of the wicked shall be broken,<br>but the L<small>ORD</small> is the support of the righteous.
The L<small>ORD</small> is concerned for the needs<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “days.”</i> of the blameless;<br>their portion lasts forever;
they shall not come to grief in bad times;<br>in famine, they shall eat their fill.
But the wicked shall perish,<br>and the enemies of the L<small>ORD</small> shall be consumed,<br>like meadow grass<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> consumed in smoke.
The wicked man borrows and does not repay;<br>the righteous is generous and keeps giving.
Those blessed by Him shall inherit the land,<br>but those cursed by Him shall be cut off.
The steps of a man are made firm by the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>when He delights in his way.
Though he stumbles, he does not fall down,<br>for the L<small>ORD</small> gives him support.
I have been young and am now old,<br>but I have never seen a righteous man abandoned,<br>or his children seeking bread.
He is always generous, and lends,<br>and his children are held blessed.
Shun evil and do good,<br>and you shall abide forever.
For the L<small>ORD</small> loves what is right,<br>He does not abandon His faithful ones.<br>They are preserved forever,<br>while the children of the wicked will be cut off.
The righteous shall inherit the land,<br>and abide forever in it.
The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom,<br>and his tongue speaks what is right.
The teaching of his God is in his heart;<br>his feet do not slip.
The wicked watches for the righteous,<br>seeking to put him to death;
the L<small>ORD</small> will not abandon him to his power;<br>He will not let him be condemned in judgment.
Look to the L<small>ORD</small> and keep to His way,<br>and He will raise you high that you may inherit the land;<br>when the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.
I saw a wicked man, powerful,<br>well-rooted like a robust native tree.
Suddenly he vanished and was gone;<br>I sought him, but he was not to be found.
Mark the blameless, note the upright,<br>for there is a future for the man of integrity.
But transgressors shall be utterly destroyed,<br>the future of the wicked shall be cut off.
The deliverance of the righteous comes from the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>their stronghold in time of trouble.
The L<small>ORD</small> helps them and rescues them,<br>rescues them from the wicked and delivers them,<br>for they seek refuge in Him.

Chapter 38

A psalm of David. <i>Lehazkir</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i><br>
O L<small>ORD</small>, do not punish me in wrath;<br>do not chastise me in fury.
For Your arrows have struck me;<br>Your blows have fallen upon me.
There is no soundness in my flesh because of Your rage,<br>no wholeness in my bones because of my sin.
For my iniquities have <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “passed over my head.”</i>overwhelmed me;<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>they are like a heavy burden, more than I can bear.
My wounds stink and fester<br>because of my folly.
I am all bent and bowed;<br>I walk about in gloom all day long.
For my sinews are full of fever;<br>there is no soundness in my flesh.
I am all benumbed and crushed;<br>I roar because of the turmoil in my mind.<br>
O Lord, You are aware of all my entreaties;<br>my groaning is not hidden from You.
My mind reels;<br>my strength fails me;<br>my eyes too have lost their luster.
My friends and companions stand back from my affliction;<br>my kinsmen stand far off.
Those who seek my life lay traps;<br>those who wish me harm speak malice;<br>they utter deceit all the time.
But I am like a deaf man, unhearing,<br>like a dumb man who cannot speak up;
I am like one who does not hear,<br>who has no retort on his lips.
But I wait for You, O L<small>ORD</small>;<br>You will answer, O Lord, my God.
For I fear they will rejoice over me;<br>when my foot gives way they will vaunt themselves against me.
For I am on the verge of collapse;<br>my pain is always with me.
I acknowledge my iniquity;<br>I am fearful over my sin;
for my mortal enemies are numerous;<br>my treacherous foes are many.
Those who repay evil for good<br>harass me for pursuing good.
Do not abandon me, O L<small>ORD</small>;<br>my God, be not far from me;
hasten to my aid,<br>O Lord, my deliverance.

Deliver me from all my transgressions;<br>make me not the butt of the benighted.
I am dumb, I do not speak up,<br>for it is Your doing.

Let those who say “Aha! Aha!” over me<br>be desolate because of their frustration.
But let all who seek You be glad and rejoice in You;<br>let those who are eager for Your deliverance always say,<br>“Extolled be the L<small>ORD</small>!”

Chapter 44

For the leader. Of the Korahites. A <i>maskil</i>.<br>
We have heard, O God,<br>our fathers have told us<br>the deeds You performed in their time,<br>in days of old.
With Your hand You planted them,<br>displacing nations;<br>You brought misfortune on peoples,<br>and drove them out.
It was not by their sword that they took the land,<br>their arm did not give them victory,<br>but Your right hand, Your arm, and Your goodwill,<br>for You favored them.
You are my king, O God;<br>decree victories for Jacob!
Through You we gore our foes;<br>by Your name we trample our adversaries;
I do not trust in my bow;<br>it is not my sword that gives me victory;
You give us victory over our foes;<br>You thwart those who hate us.
In God we glory at all times,<br>and praise Your name unceasingly. <i>Selah</i>.<br>
Yet You have rejected and disgraced us;<br>You do not go with our armies.
You make us retreat before our foe;<br>our enemies plunder us at will.
You let them devour us like sheep;<br>You disperse us among the nations.
You sell Your people for no fortune,<br>You set no high price on them.
You make us the butt of our neighbors,<br>the scorn and derision of those around us.
You make us a byword among the nations,<br>a laughingstock<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “a wagging of the head.”</i> among the peoples.
I am always aware of my disgrace;<br>I am wholly covered with shame
at the sound of taunting revilers,<br>in the presence of the vengeful foe.<br>
All this has come upon us,<br>yet we have not forgotten You,<br>or been false to Your covenant.
Our hearts have not gone astray,<br>nor have our feet swerved from Your path,
though You cast us, crushed, to where the <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. tannim = tannin, as in Ezek. 29.3 and 32.2.</i>sea monster<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup> is,<br>and covered us over with deepest darkness.
If we forgot the name of our God<br>and spread forth our hands to a foreign god,
God would surely search it out,<br>for He knows the secrets of the heart.
It is for Your sake that we are slain all day long,<br>that we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.<br>
Rouse Yourself; why do You sleep, O Lord?<br>Awaken, do not reject us forever!
Why do You hide Your face,<br>ignoring our affliction and distress?
We lie prostrate in the dust;<br>our body clings to the ground.
Arise and help us,<br>redeem us, as befits Your faithfulness.

There is a river whose streams gladden God’s city,<br>the holy dwelling-place of the Most High.

Through its citadels, God has made Himself known as a haven.
See, the kings joined forces;<br>they advanced together.
At the mere sight of it they were stunned,<br>they were terrified, they panicked;

as the Tarshish fleet was wrecked<br>in an easterly gale.<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">See 1 Kings 22.49.</i>

Chapter 49

For the leader. Of the Korahites. A psalm.<br>
Hear this, all you peoples;<br>give ear, all inhabitants of the world,

My mouth utters wisdom,<br>my speech<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “utterance of my heart”; on leb, cf. Ps. 19.15.</i> is full of insight.
I will turn my attention to a theme,<br>set forth my lesson to the music of a lyre.<br>
In time of trouble, why should I fear<br>the encompassing evil of those who would supplant me—
men who trust in their riches,<br>who glory in their great wealth?
<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Or “A brother.”</i>Ah, it<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup> cannot redeem a man,<br>or pay his ransom to God;
the price of life is too high;<br>and so one ceases to be, forever.
Shall he live eternally,<br>and never see the grave?
For one sees that the wise die,<br>that the foolish and ignorant both perish,<br>leaving their wealth to others.
Their grave<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Taken with ancient versions and medieval commentators as the equivalent of qibram.</i> is their eternal home,<br>the dwelling-place for all generations<br>of those once famous on earth.
Man does not abide in honor;<br>he is like the beasts that perish.<br>
Such is the fate of those who are self-confident,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>the end of those pleased with their own talk.<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup> <i>Selah</i>.<br>

But God will redeem my life from the clutches of Sheol,<br>for He will take me. <i>Selah</i>.<br>
Do not be afraid when a man becomes rich,<br>when his household goods increase;
for when he dies he can take none of it along;<br>his goods cannot follow him down.
Though he congratulates himself in his lifetime<br>—<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>“They must admit that you did well by yourself”<sup class="endFootnote">-d</sup>—
yet he must join the company of his ancestors,<br>who will never see daylight again.

From Zion, perfect in beauty,<br>God appeared
—let our God come and not fail to act!<br>Devouring fire preceded Him;<br>it stormed around Him fiercely.
He summoned the heavens above,<br>and the earth, for the trial of His people.
“Bring in My devotees,<br>who made a covenant with Me over sacrifice!”
Then the heavens proclaimed His righteousness,<br>for He is a God who judges. <i>Selah</i>.<br>
“Pay heed, My people, and I will speak,<br>O Israel, and I will arraign you.<br>I am God, your God.
I censure you not for your sacrifices,<br>and your burnt offerings, made to Me daily;
I claim no bull from your estate,<br>no he-goats from your pens.
For Mine is every animal of the forest,<br>the beasts on <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>a thousand mountains.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
I know every bird of the mountains,<br>the creatures of the field are subject to Me.
Were I hungry, I would not tell you,<br>for Mine is the world and all it holds.
Do I eat the flesh of bulls,<br>or drink the blood of he-goats?
Sacrifice a thank offering to God,<br>and pay your vows to the Most High.
Call upon Me in time of trouble;<br>I will rescue you, and you shall honor Me.”<br>
And to the wicked, God said:<br>“Who are you to recite My laws,<br>and mouth the terms of My covenant,
seeing that you spurn My discipline,<br>and brush My words aside?
When you see a thief, you fall in with him,<br>and throw in your lot with adulterers;
you devote your mouth to evil,<br>and yoke your tongue to deceit;
you are busy maligning your brother,<br>defaming the son of your mother.
If I failed to act when you did these things,<br>you would fancy that I was like you;<br>so I censure you and confront you with charges.
Mark this, you who are unmindful of God,<br>lest I tear you apart and no one save you.<br>
He who sacrifices a thank offering honors Me,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>and to him who improves his way<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>I will show the salvation of God.”

Have mercy upon me, O God,<br>as befits Your faithfulness;<br>in keeping with Your abundant compassion,<br>blot out my transgressions.
Wash me thoroughly of my iniquity,<br>and purify me of my sin;
for I recognize my transgressions,<br>and am ever conscious of my sin.
Against You alone have I sinned,<br>and done what is evil in Your sight;<br>so You are just in Your sentence,<br>and right in Your judgment.
Indeed I was born with iniquity;<br>with sin my mother conceived me.
<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Indeed You desire truth about that which is hidden;<br>teach me wisdom about secret things.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>
Purge me with hyssop till I am pure;<br>wash me till I am whiter than snow.
Let me hear tidings of joy and gladness;<br>let the bones You have crushed exult.
Hide Your face from my sins;<br>blot out all my iniquities.
Fashion a pure heart for me, O God;<br>create in me a steadfast spirit.
Do not cast me out of Your presence,<br>or take Your holy spirit away from me.
Let me again rejoice in Your help;<br>let a vigorous spirit sustain me.
I will teach transgressors Your ways,<br>that sinners may return to You.<br>
Save me from bloodguilt,<br>O God, God, my deliverer,<br>that I may sing forth Your beneficence.
O Lord, open my lips,<br>and let my mouth declare Your praise.
You do not want me to bring sacrifices;<br>You do not desire burnt offerings;
True sacrifice to God is a contrite spirit;<br>God, You will not despise<br>a contrite and crushed heart.<br>
May it please You to make Zion prosper;<br>rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.
Then You will want sacrifices offered in righteousness,<br>burnt and whole offerings;<br>then bulls will be offered on Your altar.

Your tongue devises mischief,<br>like a sharpened razor that works treacherously.
You prefer evil to good,<br>the lie, to speaking truthfully. <i>Selah</i>.
You love all pernicious words,<br>treacherous speech.
So God will tear you down for good,<br>will break you and pluck you from your tent,<br>and root you out of the land of the living. <i>Selah</i>.
The righteous, seeing it, will be awestruck;<br>they will jibe at him, saying,

at the clamor of the enemy,<br>because of the oppression of the wicked;<br>for they bring evil upon me<br>and furiously harass me.
My heart is convulsed within me;<br>terrors of death assail me.
Fear and trembling invade me;<br>I am clothed with horror.

surely, I would flee far off;<br>I would lodge in the wilderness; <i>selah</i>

O Lord, confound their speech, confuse it!<br>For I see lawlessness and strife in the city;
day and night they make their rounds on its walls;<br>evil and mischief are inside it.
Malice is within it;<br>fraud and deceit never leave its square.<br>
It is not an enemy who reviles me<br>—I could bear that;<br>it is not my foe who vaunts himself against me<br>—I could hide from him;

Cast your burden on the L<small>ORD</small> and He will sustain you;<br>He will never let the righteous man collapse.

because of their sinful mouths,<br>the words on their lips.<br>Let them be trapped by their pride,<br>and by the imprecations and lies they utter.
In Your fury put an end to them;<br>put an end to them that they be no more;<br>that it may be known to the ends of the earth<br>that God does rule over Jacob. <i>Selah</i>.<br>
They come each evening growling like dogs,<br>roaming the city.
They wander in search of food;<br>and whine if they are not satisfied.
But I will sing of Your strength,<br>extol each morning Your faithfulness;<br>for You have been my haven,<br>a refuge in time of trouble.<br>
O my strength, to You I sing hymns;<br>for God is my haven, my faithful God.

O God, when You went at the head of Your army,<br>when You marched through the desert, <i>selah</i>
the earth trembled, the sky rained because of God,<br>yon Sinai, because of God, the God of Israel.
You released a bountiful rain, O God;<br>when Your own land languished, You sustained it.
Your tribe dwells there;<br>O God, in Your goodness You provide for the needy.<br>
The Lord gives a command;<br>the women who bring the news are a great host:
“The kings and their armies are in headlong flight;<br>housewives are sharing in the spoils;
even for those of you who lie among the sheepfolds<br>there are wings of a dove sheathed in silver,<br>its pinions in fine gold.”
When Shaddai scattered the kings,<br>it seemed like a snowstorm in Zalmon.<br>
O majestic mountain, Mount Bashan;<br>O jagged mountain, Mount Bashan;
why so hostile, O jagged mountains,<br>toward the mountain God desired as His dwelling?<br>The L<small>ORD</small> shall abide there forever.<br>
God’s chariots are myriads upon myriads,<br>thousands upon thousands;<br>the Lord is among them as in Sinai in holiness.<br>

In assemblies bless God,<br>the L<small>ORD</small>, O you who are from the fountain of Israel.
There is little Benjamin who rules them,<br>the princes of Judah who command them,<br>the princes of Zebulun and Naphtali.<br>
Your God has ordained strength for you,<br>the strength, O God,<br>which You displayed for us
from Your temple above Jerusalem.<br>The kings bring You tribute.
Blast the beast of the marsh,<br>the herd of bulls among the peoples, the calves,<br>till they come cringing with pieces of silver.<br>Scatter the peoples who delight in wars!
Tribute-bearers shall come from Egypt;<br>Cush shall hasten its gifts to God.<br>

Deliver me, O God,<br>for the waters have reached my neck;
I am sinking into the slimy deep<br>and find no foothold;<br>I have come into the watery depths;<br>the flood sweeps me away.
I am weary with calling;<br>my throat is dry;<br>my eyes fail<br>while I wait for God.
More numerous than the hairs of my head<br>are those who hate me without reason;<br>many are those who would destroy me,<br>my treacherous enemies.<br>Must I restore what I have not stolen?<br>
God, You know my folly;<br>my guilty deeds are not hidden from You.
Let those who look to You,<br>O Lord, G<small>OD</small> of hosts,<br>not be disappointed on my account;<br>let those who seek You,<br>O God of Israel,<br>not be shamed because of me.
It is for Your sake that I have been reviled,<br>that shame covers my face;
I am a stranger to my brothers,<br>an alien to my kin.
My zeal for Your house has been my undoing;<br>the reproaches of those who revile You have fallen upon me.
When I wept and fasted,<br>I was reviled for it.
I made sackcloth my garment;<br>I became a byword among them.
Those who sit in the gate talk about me;<br>I am the taunt of drunkards.<br>
As for me, may my prayer come to You, O L<small>ORD</small>,<br>at a favorable moment;<br>O God, in Your abundant faithfulness,<br>answer me with Your sure deliverance.
Rescue me from the mire;<br>let me not sink;<br>let me be rescued from my enemies,<br>and from the watery depths.

do not hide Your face from Your servant,<br>for I am in distress;<br>answer me quickly.
Come near to me and redeem me;<br>free me from my enemies.<br>

Reproach breaks my heart,<br>I am in despair;<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i><br>I hope for consolation, but there is none,<br>for comforters, but find none.
They give me gall for food,<br>vinegar to quench my thirst.
May their table be a trap for them,<br>a snare for their allies.
May their eyes grow dim so that they cannot see;<br>may their loins collapse continually.
Pour out Your wrath on them;<br>may Your blazing anger overtake them;
may their encampments be desolate;<br>may their tents stand empty.
For they persecute those You have struck;<br>they talk about the pain of those You have felled.
Add that to their guilt;<br>let them have no share of Your beneficence;
may they be erased from the book of life,<br>and not be inscribed with the righteous.<br>
But I am lowly and in pain;<br>Your help, O God, keeps me safe.
I will extol God’s name with song,<br>and exalt Him with praise.
That will please the L<small>ORD</small> more than oxen,<br>than bulls with horns and hooves.
The lowly will see and rejoice;<br>you who are mindful of God, take heart!
For the L<small>ORD</small> listens to the needy,<br>and does not spurn His captives.<br>
Heaven and earth shall extol Him,<br>the seas, and all that moves in them.
For God will deliver Zion<br>and rebuild the cities of Judah;<br>they shall live there and inherit it;

it was You who crushed the heads of Leviathan,<br>who left him as food for <sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Or “seafaring men”; meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>the denizens of the desert;<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup>
it was You who released springs and torrents,<br>who made mighty rivers run dry;
the day is Yours, the night also;<br>it was You who set in place the orb of the sun;
You fixed all the boundaries of the earth;<br>summer and winter—You made them.<br>
Be mindful of how the enemy blasphemes the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>how base people revile Your name.
Do not deliver Your dove to the wild beast;<br>do not ignore forever the band of Your lowly ones.
Look to the covenant!<br>For the dark places of the land are full of the haunts of lawlessness.
Let not the downtrodden turn away disappointed;<br>let the poor and needy praise Your name.
Rise, O God, champion Your cause;<br>be mindful that You are blasphemed by base men all day long.
Do not ignore the shouts of Your foes,<br>the din of Your adversaries that ascends all the time.

Chapter 75

For the leader; <i>al tashḥeth</i>.<br>A psalm of Asaph, a song.<br>
We praise You, O God;<br>we praise You;<br>Your presence is near;<br>men tell of Your wondrous deeds.<br>
“At the time I choose,<br>I will give judgment equitably.
Earth and all its inhabitants dissolve;<br>it is I who keep its pillars firm. <i>Selah</i>.
To wanton men I say, ‘Do not be wanton!’<br>to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up your horns!’”<br>
Do not lift your horns up high<br><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “with arrogant neck you speak.”</i>in vainglorious bluster.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>

There is a cup in the L<small>ORD</small>’s hand<br>with foaming wine fully mixed;<br>from this He pours;<br>all the wicked of the earth drink,<br>draining it to the very dregs.
As for me, I will declare forever,<br>I will sing a hymn to the God of Jacob.<br>
“All the horns of the wicked I will cut;<br>but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.”

Chapter 76

For the leader; with instrumental music.<br>A psalm of Asaph, a song.<br>
God has made Himself known in Judah,<br>His name is great in Israel;
Salem became His abode;<br>Zion, His den.
There He broke the fiery arrows of the bow,<br>the shield and the sword of war. <i>Selah</i>.<br>
You were resplendent,<br>glorious, on the mountains of prey.
The stout-hearted were despoiled;<br>they were in a stupor;<br>the bravest of men could not lift a hand.
At Your blast, O God of Jacob,<br>horse and chariot lay stunned.
O You! You are awesome!<br>Who can withstand You<br>when You are enraged?
In heaven You pronounced sentence;<br>the earth was numbed with fright
as God rose to execute judgment,<br>to deliver all the lowly of the earth. <i>Selah</i>.<br>

Chapter 77

For the leader; on <i>Jeduthun</i>.<br>Of Asaph. A psalm.<br>
I cry aloud to God;<br>I cry to God that He may give ear to me.
In my time of distress I turn to the Lord,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>with my hand [uplifted];<br>[my eyes] flow all night without respite;<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br><br>I will not be comforted.
I call God to mind, I moan,<br>I complain, my spirit fails. <i>Selah</i>.<br>
You have held my eyelids open;<br>I am overwrought, I cannot speak.
My thoughts turn to days of old,<br>to years long past.
I recall at night their jibes at me;<br>I commune with myself;<br>my spirit inquires,
“Will the Lord reject forever<br>and never again show favor?
Has His faithfulness disappeared forever?<br>Will His promise be unfulfilled for all time?
Has God forgotten how to pity?<br>Has He in anger stifled His compassion?” <i>Selah</i>.
And I said, <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>“It is my fault<br>that the right hand of the Most High has changed.”<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br>
I recall the deeds of the L<small>ORD</small>;<br>yes, I recall Your wonders of old;
I recount all Your works;<br>I speak of Your acts.
O God, Your ways are holiness;<br>what god is as great as God?
You are the God who works wonders;<br>You have manifested Your strength among the peoples.
By Your arm You redeemed Your people,<br>the children of Jacob and Joseph. <i>Selah</i>.
The waters saw You, O God,<br>the waters saw You and were convulsed;<br>the very deep quaked as well.
Clouds streamed water;<br>the heavens rumbled;<br>Your arrows flew about;
Your thunder rumbled like wheels;<br>lightning lit up the world;<br>the earth quaked and trembled.
Your way was through the sea,<br>Your path, through the mighty waters;<br>Your tracks could not be seen.
You led Your people like a flock<br>in the care of Moses and Aaron.

Chapter 78

A <i>maskil</i> of Asaph.<br><br>Give ear, my people, to my teaching,<br>turn your ear to what I say.
I will expound a theme,<br>hold forth on the lessons of the past,
things we have heard and known,<br>that our fathers have told us.
We will not withhold them from their children,<br>telling the coming generation<br>the praises of the L<small>ORD</small> and His might,<br>and the wonders He performed.
He established a decree in Jacob,<br>ordained a teaching in Israel,<br>charging our fathers<br>to make them known to their children,
that a future generation might know<br>—children yet to be born—<br>and in turn tell their children
that they might put their confidence in God,<br>and not forget God’s great deeds,<br>but observe His commandments,
and not be like their fathers,<br>a wayward and defiant generation,<br>a generation whose heart was inconstant,<br>whose spirit was not true to God.<br>
Like the Ephraimite bowmen<br>who played false in the day of battle,
they did not keep God’s covenant,<br>they refused to follow His instruction;
they forgot His deeds<br>and the wonders that He showed them.
He performed marvels in the sight of their fathers,<br>in the land of Egypt, the plain of Zoan.
He split the sea and took them through it;<br>He made the waters stand like a wall.
He led them with a cloud by day,<br>and throughout the night by the light of fire.
He split rocks in the wilderness<br>and gave them drink as if from the great deep.
He brought forth streams from a rock<br>and made them flow down like a river.<br>
But they went on sinning against Him,<br>defying the Most High in the parched land.
To test God was in their mind<br>when they demanded food for themselves.
They spoke against God, saying,<br>“Can God spread a feast in the wilderness?
True, He struck the rock and waters flowed,<br>streams gushed forth;<br>but can He provide bread?<br>Can He supply His people with meat?”
The L<small>ORD</small> heard and He raged;<br>fire broke out against Jacob,<br>anger flared up at Israel,
because they did not put their trust in God,<br>did not rely on His deliverance.
So He commanded the skies above,<br>He opened the doors of heaven
and rained manna upon them for food,<br>giving them heavenly grain.
Each man ate a hero’s meal;<br>He sent them provision in plenty.
He set the east wind moving in heaven,<br>and drove the south wind by His might.
He rained meat on them like dust,<br>winged birds like the sands of the sea,
making them come down inside His camp,<br>around His dwelling-place.
They ate till they were sated;<br>He gave them what they craved.
They had not yet wearied of what they craved,<br>the food was still in their mouths
when God’s anger flared up at them.<br>He slew their sturdiest,<br>struck down the youth of Israel.
Nonetheless, they went on sinning<br>and had no faith in His wonders.
He made their days end in futility,<br>their years in sudden death.
When He struck<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “killed.”</i> them, they turned to Him<br>and sought God once again.
They remembered that God was their rock,<br>God Most High, their Redeemer.
Yet they deceived Him with their speech,<br>lied to Him with their words;
their hearts were inconstant toward Him;<br>they were untrue to His covenant.
But He, being merciful, forgave iniquity<br>and would not destroy;<br>He restrained His wrath time and again<br>and did not give full vent to His fury;
for He remembered that they were but flesh,<br>a passing breath that does not return.<br>
How often did they defy Him in the wilderness,<br>did they grieve Him in the wasteland!
Again and again they tested God,<br>vexed<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Or “set a limit to.”</i> the Holy One of Israel.
They did not remember His strength,<br>or the day He redeemed them from the foe;
how He displayed His signs in Egypt,<br>His wonders in the plain of Zoan.
He turned their rivers into blood;<br>He made their waters undrinkable.
He inflicted upon them swarms of insects to devour them,<br>frogs to destroy them.
He gave their crops over to grubs,<br>their produce to locusts.
He killed their vines with hail,<br>their sycamores <sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>with frost.<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup>
He gave their beasts over to hail,<br>their cattle to lightning bolts.
He inflicted His burning anger upon them,<br>wrath, indignation, trouble,<br>a band of deadly messengers.
He cleared a path for His anger;<br>He did not stop short of slaying them,<br>but gave them over to pestilence.
He struck every first-born in Egypt,<br>the first fruits of their vigor in the tents of Ham.
He set His people moving like sheep,<br>drove them like a flock in the wilderness.
He led them in safety; they were unafraid;<br>as for their enemies, the sea covered them.
He brought them to His holy realm,<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Or “hill” with Septuagint and Saadia.</i><br>the mountain His right hand had acquired.
He expelled nations before them,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Inverted for clarity.</i>settled the tribes of Israel in their tents,<br>allotting them their portion by the line.<sup class="endFootnote">-e</sup><br>
Yet they defiantly tested God Most High,<br>and did not observe His decrees.
They fell away, disloyal like their fathers;<br>they played false like a treacherous bow.
They vexed Him with their high places;<br>they incensed Him with their idols.
God heard it and was enraged;<br>He utterly rejected Israel.
He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh,<br>the tent He had set among men.
He let His might<sup class="footnote-marker">f</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Ark; cf. Ps. 132.8.</i> go into captivity,<br>His glory into the hands of the foe.
He gave His people over to the sword;<br>He was enraged at His very own.
Fire consumed their young men,<br>and their maidens <sup class="footnote-marker">g</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “had no nuptial song.”</i>remained unwed.<sup class="endFootnote">-g</sup>
Their priests fell by the sword,<br>and their widows could not weep.<br>
The Lord awoke as from sleep,<br>like a warrior <sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>shaking off<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup> wine.
He beat back His foes,<br>dealing them lasting disgrace.
He rejected the clan of Joseph;<br>He did not choose the tribe of Ephraim.
He did choose the tribe of Judah,<br>Mount Zion, which He loved.
He built His Sanctuary like the heavens,<br>like the earth that He established forever.
He chose David, His servant,<br>and took him from the sheepfolds.
He brought him from minding the nursing ewes<br>to tend His people Jacob, Israel, His very own.
He tended them with blameless heart;<br>with skillful hands he led them.

Chapter 79

A psalm of Asaph.<br><br>O God, heathens have entered Your domain,<br>defiled Your holy temple,<br>and turned Jerusalem into ruins.
They have left Your servants’ corpses<br>as food for the fowl of heaven,<br>and the flesh of Your faithful for the wild beasts.
Their blood was shed like water around Jerusalem,<br>with none to bury them.
We have become the butt of our neighbors,<br>the scorn and derision of those around us.<br>
How long, O L<small>ORD</small>, will You be angry forever,<br>will Your indignation blaze like fire?
Pour out Your fury on the nations that do not know You,<br>upon the kingdoms that do not invoke Your name,
for they have devoured Jacob<br>and desolated his home.
Do not hold our former iniquities against us;<br>let Your compassion come swiftly toward us,<br>for we have sunk very low.
Help us, O God, our deliverer,<br>for the sake of the glory of Your name.<br>Save us and forgive our sin,<br>for the sake of Your name.
Let the nations not say, “Where is their God?”<br>Before our eyes let it be known among the nations<br>that You avenge the spilled blood of Your servants.
Let the groans of the prisoners reach You;<br>reprieve those condemned to death,<br>as befits Your great strength.
Pay back our neighbors sevenfold<br>for the abuse they have flung at You, O Lord.
Then we, Your people,<br>the flock You shepherd,<br>shall glorify You forever;<br>for all time we shall tell Your praises.

Chapter 80

For the leader; on <i>shoshannim</i>, <i>eduth</i>. Of Asaph. A psalm.<br>
Give ear, O shepherd of Israel<br>who leads Joseph like a flock!<br>Appear, You who are enthroned on the cherubim,
at the head of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh!<br>Rouse Your might and come to our help!
Restore us, O God;<br>show Your favor that we may be delivered.<br>
O L<small>ORD</small>, God of hosts,<br>how long will You be wrathful<br>toward the prayers of Your people?
You have fed them tears as their daily bread,<br>made them drink great measures of tears.
You set us at strife with our neighbors;<br>our enemies mock us at will.
O God of hosts, restore us;<br>show Your favor that we may be delivered.<br>
You plucked up a vine from Egypt;<br>You expelled nations and planted it.
You cleared a place for it;<br>it took deep root and filled the land.
The mountains were covered by its shade,<br>mighty cedars by its boughs.
Its branches reached the sea,<br>its shoots, the river.
Why did You breach its wall<br>so that every passerby plucks its fruit,
wild boars gnaw at it,<br>and creatures of the field feed on it?<br>
O God of hosts, turn again,<br>look down from heaven and see;<br>take note of that vine,
the stock planted by Your right hand,<br>the stem<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “son.”</i> you have taken as Your own.
For it is burned by fire and cut down,<br>perishing before Your angry blast.
Grant Your help<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “hand.”</i> to the man at Your right hand,<br>the one You have taken as Your own.
We will not turn away from You;<br>preserve our life that we may invoke Your name.
O L<small>ORD</small>, God of hosts, restore us;<br>show Your favor that we may be delivered.

Chapter 81

For the leader; on the <i>gittith</i>. Of Asaph.<br>
Sing joyously to God, our strength;<br>raise a shout for the God of Jacob.
Take up the song,<br>sound the timbrel,<br>the melodious lyre and harp.
Blow the horn on the new moon,<br>on the full moon for our feast day.
For it is a law for Israel,<br>a ruling of the God of Jacob;
He imposed it as a decree upon Joseph<br>when <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Or “He went forth against.”</i>he went forth from<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> the land of Egypt;<br>I heard a language that I knew not.<br>
I relieved his shoulder of the burden,<br>his hands were freed from the basket.
In distress you called and I rescued you;<br>I answered you from the <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>secret place of thunder<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>I tested you at the waters of Meribah. <i>Selah</i>.<br>
Hear, My people, and I will admonish you;<br>Israel, if you would but listen to Me!
You shall have no foreign god,<br>you shall not bow to an alien god.
I the L<small>ORD</small> am your God<br>who brought you out of the land of Egypt;<br>open your mouth wide and I will fill it.<br>
But My people would not listen to Me,<br>Israel would not obey Me.
So I let them go after their willful heart<br>that they might follow their own devices.
If only My people would listen to Me,<br>if Israel would follow My paths,
then would I subdue their enemies at once,<br>strike their foes again and again.
Those who hate the L<small>ORD</small> shall cower before Him;<br>their doom shall be eternal.
He fed them<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “him,” i.e., Israel.</i> the finest wheat;<br>I sated you with honey from the rock.

Chapter 82

A psalm of Asaph.<br><br>God stands in the divine assembly;<br>among the divine beings He pronounces judgment.
How long will you judge perversely,<br>showing favor to the wicked? <i>Selah</i>.
Judge the wretched and the orphan,<br>vindicate the lowly and the poor,
rescue the wretched and the needy;<br>save them from the hand of the wicked.<br>
They neither know nor understand,<br>they go about in darkness;<br>all the foundations of the earth totter.
I had taken you for divine beings,<br>sons of the Most High, all of you;
but you shall die as men do,<br>fall like any prince.<br>
Arise, O God, judge the earth,<br>for all the nations are Your possession.

Chapter 83

For Your enemies rage,<br>Your foes <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “lift up the head.”</i>assert themselves.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>
They plot craftily against Your people,<br>take counsel against Your treasured ones.
They say, “Let us wipe them out as a nation;<br>Israel’s name will be mentioned no more.”
Unanimous in their counsel<br>they have made an alliance against You—
the clans of Edom and the Ishmaelites,<br>Moab and the Hagrites,
Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek,<br>Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
Assyria too joins forces with them;<br>they give support to the sons of Lot. <i>Selah</i>.<br>
Deal with them as You did with Midian,<br>with Sisera, with Jabin,<br>at the brook Kishon—
who were destroyed at En-dor,<br>who became dung for the field.
Treat their great men like Oreb and Zeeb,<br>all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
who said, “Let us take the meadows of God as our possession.”
O my God, make them like thistledown,<br>like stubble driven by the wind.
As a fire burns a forest,<br>as flames scorch the hills,
pursue them with Your tempest,<br>terrify them with Your storm.
Cover<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “Fill.”</i> their faces with shame<br>so that they seek Your name, O L<small>ORD</small>.
May they be frustrated and terrified,<br>disgraced and doomed forever.
May they know<br>that Your name, Yours alone, is the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>supreme over all the earth.

Chapter 84

How lovely is Your dwelling-place,<br>O L<small>ORD</small> of hosts.
I long, I yearn for the courts of the L<small>ORD</small>;<br>my body and soul shout for joy to the living God.
Even the sparrow has found a home,<br>and the swallow a nest for herself<br>in which to set her young,<br>near Your altar, O L<small>ORD</small> of hosts,<br>my king and my God.
Happy are those who dwell in Your house;<br>they forever praise You. <i>Selah</i>.<br>

O L<small>ORD</small>, God of hosts,<br>hear my prayer;<br>give ear, O God of Jacob. <i>Selah</i>.
O God, behold our shield,<br>look upon the face of Your anointed.<br>
Better one day in Your courts than a thousand [anywhere else];<br>I would rather stand at the threshold of God’s house<br>than dwell in the tents of the wicked.
For the L<small>ORD</small> God is sun<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Or “bulwark,” with Targum; cf. Isa. 54.12.</i> and shield;<br>the L<small>ORD</small> bestows grace and glory;<br>He does not withhold His bounty from those who live without blame.

Turn again, O God, our helper,<br>revoke Your displeasure with us.
Will You be angry with us forever,<br>prolong Your wrath for all generations?
Surely You will revive us again,<br>so that Your people may rejoice in You.
Show us, O L<small>ORD</small>, Your faithfulness;<br>grant us Your deliverance.<br>
Let me hear what God, the L<small>ORD</small>, will speak;<br>He will promise well-being to His people, His faithful ones;<br>may they not turn to folly.
His help is very near those who fear Him,<br>to make His glory dwell in our land.
Faithfulness and truth meet;<br>justice and well-being kiss.
Truth springs up from the earth;<br>justice looks down from heaven.
The L<small>ORD</small> also bestows His bounty;<br>our land yields its produce.
Justice goes before Him<br>as He sets out on His way.

Teach me Your way, O L<small>ORD</small>;<br>I will walk in Your truth;<br>let my heart be undivided in reverence for Your name.
I will praise You, O Lord, my God, with all my heart<br>and pay honor to Your name forever.
For Your steadfast love toward me is great;<br>You have saved me from the depths of Sheol.<br>
O God, arrogant men have risen against me;<br>a band of ruthless men seek my life;<br>they are not mindful of You.
But You, O Lord, are a God<br>compassionate and merciful,<br>slow to anger, abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.
Turn to me and have mercy on me;<br>grant Your strength to Your servant<br>and deliver the son of Your maidservant.

A <i>maskil</i> of Ethan the Ezrahite.<br>
I will sing of the L<small>ORD</small>’s steadfast love forever;<br>to all generations I will proclaim Your faithfulness with my mouth.
I declare, “Your steadfast love is confirmed forever;<br>there in the heavens You establish Your faithfulness.”<br>
“I have made a covenant with My chosen one;<br>I have sworn to My servant David:
I will establish your offspring forever,<br>I will confirm your throne for all generations.” <i>Selah</i>.<br>
Your wonders, O L<small>ORD</small>, are praised by the heavens,<br>Your faithfulness, too, in the assembly of holy beings.
For who in the skies can equal the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>can compare with the L<small>ORD</small> among the divine beings,
a God greatly dreaded in the council of holy beings,<br>held in awe by all around Him?
O L<small>ORD</small>, God of hosts,<br>who is mighty like You, O L<small>ORD</small>?<br>Your faithfulness surrounds You;
You rule the swelling of the sea;<br>when its waves surge, You still them.
You crushed Rahab; he was like a corpse;<br>with Your powerful arm You scattered Your enemies.
The heaven is Yours,<br>the earth too;<br>the world and all it holds—<br>You established them.
North and south—<br>You created them;<br>Tabor and Hermon sing forth Your name.
Yours is an arm endowed with might;<br>Your hand is strong;<br>Your right hand, exalted.
Righteousness and justice are the base of Your throne;<br>steadfast love and faithfulness stand before You.<br>
Happy is the people who know the joyful shout;<br>O L<small>ORD</small>, they walk in the light of Your presence.
They rejoice in Your name all day long;<br>they are exalted through Your righteousness.
For You are their strength in which they glory;<br>our horn is exalted through Your favor.
Truly our shield is of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>our king, of the Holy One of Israel.<br>
Then<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to vv. 4–5; cf. 2 Sam. 7.1–17.</i> You spoke to Your faithful ones in a vision<br>and said, “I have conferred power upon a warrior;<br>I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
I have found David, My servant;<br>anointed him with My sacred oil.
My hand shall be constantly with him,<br>and My arm shall strengthen him.
No enemy shall <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>oppress him,<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>no vile man afflict him.
I will crush his adversaries before him;<br>I will strike down those who hate him.
My faithfulness and steadfast love shall be with him;<br>his horn shall be exalted through My name.
I will set his hand upon the sea,<br>his right hand upon the rivers.
He shall say to Me,<br>‘You are my father, my God, the rock of my deliverance.’
I will appoint him first-born,<br>highest of the kings of the earth.
I will maintain My steadfast love for him always;<br>My covenant with him shall endure.
I will establish his line forever,<br>his throne, as long as the heavens last.
If his sons forsake My Teaching<br>and do not live by My rules;
if they violate My laws,<br>and do not observe My commands,
I will punish their transgression with the rod,<br>their iniquity with plagues.
But I will not take away My steadfast love from him;<br>I will not betray My faithfulness.
I will not violate My covenant,<br>or change what I have uttered.
I have sworn by My holiness, once and for all;<br>I will not be false to David.
His line shall continue forever,<br>his throne, as the sun before Me,
as the moon, established forever,<br>an enduring witness in the sky.” <i>Selah</i>.<br>
Yet You have rejected, spurned,<br>and become enraged at Your anointed.
You have repudiated the covenant with Your servant;<br>You have dragged his dignity in the dust.
You have breached all his defenses,<br>shattered his strongholds.
All who pass by plunder him;<br>he has become the butt of his neighbors.
You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries,<br>and made all his enemies rejoice.
You have turned back the blade of his sword,<br>and have not sustained him in battle.
You have brought <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>his splendor<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup> to an end<br>and have hurled his throne to the ground.
You have cut short the days of his youth;<br>You have covered him with shame. <i>Selah</i>.
How long, O L<small>ORD</small>; will You forever hide Your face,<br>will Your fury blaze like fire?
O remember <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>how short my life is;<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>why should You have created every man in vain?
What man can live and not see death,<br>can save himself from the clutches of Sheol? <i>Selah</i>.
O Lord, where is Your steadfast love of old<br>which You swore to David in Your faithfulness?
Remember, O Lord, the abuse flung at Your servants<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>that I have borne in my bosom [from] many peoples,<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
how Your enemies, O L<small>ORD</small>, have flung abuse,<br>abuse at Your anointed at every step.
Blessed is the L<small>ORD</small> forever;<br>Amen and Amen.

Chapter 90

A prayer of Moses, the man of God.<br><br>O Lord, You have been our refuge in every generation.
Before the mountains came into being,<br>before You brought forth the earth and the world,<br>from eternity to eternity You are God.<br>
You return man to dust;<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Or “contrition.”</i><br>You decreed, “Return you mortals!”
<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>For in Your sight a thousand years<br>are like yesterday that has passed,<br>like a watch of the night.
You engulf men in sleep;<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>at daybreak they are like grass that renews itself;
at daybreak it flourishes anew;<br>by dusk it withers and dries up.
So we are consumed by Your anger,<br>terror-struck by Your fury.
You have set our iniquities before You,<br>our hidden sins in the light of Your face.
All our days pass away in Your wrath;<br>we spend our years like a sigh.
The span of our life is seventy years,<br>or, given the strength, eighty years;<br>but the <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>best of them<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup> are trouble and sorrow.<br>They pass by speedily, and we <sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Or “fly away.”</i>are in darkness.<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup>
Who can know Your furious anger?<br>Your wrath matches the fear of You.
Teach us to count our days rightly,<br>that we may obtain a wise heart.<br>
Turn, O L<small>ORD</small>!<br>How long?<br>Show mercy to Your servants.
Satisfy us at daybreak with Your steadfast love<br>that we may sing for joy all our days.
Give us joy for as long as You have afflicted us,<br>for the years we have suffered misfortune.
Let Your deeds be seen by Your servants,<br>Your glory by their children.
May the favor of the Lord, our God, be upon us;<br>let the work of our hands prosper,<br>O prosper the work of our hands!

Chapter 91

O you who dwell in the shelter of the Most High<br>and abide in the protection of Shaddai—
I say of the L<small>ORD</small>, my refuge and stronghold,<br>my God in whom I trust,
that He will save you from the fowler’s trap,<br>from the destructive plague.
He will cover you with His pinions;<br>you will find refuge under His wings;<br>His fidelity is an encircling shield.
You need not fear the terror by night,<br>or the arrow that flies by day,
the plague that stalks in the darkness,<br>or the scourge that ravages at noon.
A thousand may fall at your left side,<br>ten thousand at your right,<br>but it shall not reach you.
You will see it with your eyes,<br>you will witness the punishment of the wicked.
Because you took the L<small>ORD</small>—my refuge,<br>the Most High—as your haven,
no harm will befall you,<br>no disease touch your tent.
For He will order His angels<br>to guard you wherever you go.
They will carry you in their hands<br>lest you hurt your foot on a stone.
You will tread on cubs and vipers;<br>you will trample lions and asps.<br>
“Because he is devoted to Me I will deliver him;<br>I will keep him safe, for he knows My name.
When he calls on Me, I will answer him;<br>I will be with him in distress;<br>I will rescue him and make him honored;
I will let him live to a ripe old age,<br>and show him My salvation.”

Chapter 92

A psalm. A song; for the sabbath day.<br>
It is good to praise the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>to sing hymns to Your name, O Most High,
To proclaim Your steadfast love at daybreak,<br>Your faithfulness each night
With a ten-stringed harp,<br>with voice and lyre together.<br>
You have gladdened me by Your deeds, O L<small>ORD</small>;<br>I shout for joy at Your handiwork.
How great are Your works, O L<small>ORD</small>,<br>how very subtle<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Or “profound.”</i> Your designs!
A brutish man cannot know,<br>a fool cannot understand this:
though the wicked sprout like grass,<br>though all evildoers blossom,<br>it is only that they may be destroyed forever.<br>
But You are exalted, O L<small>ORD</small>, for all time.<br>
Surely, Your enemies, O L<small>ORD</small>,<br>surely, Your enemies perish;<br>all evildoers are scattered.
You raise my horn high like that of a wild ox;<br>I am soaked in freshening oil.
I shall see the defeat of my watchful foes,<br>hear of the downfall of the wicked who beset me.
The righteous bloom like a date-palm;<br>they thrive like a cedar in Lebanon;
planted in the house of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>they flourish in the courts of our God.
In old age they still produce fruit;<br>they are full of sap and freshness,
attesting that the L<small>ORD</small> is upright,<br>my rock, in whom there is no wrong.

Chapter 93

The L<small>ORD</small> is king,<br>He is robed in grandeur;<br>the L<small>ORD</small> is robed,<br>He is girded with strength.<br>The world stands firm;<br>it cannot be shaken.
Your throne stands firm from of old;<br>from eternity You have existed.
The ocean sounds, O L<small>ORD</small>,<br>the ocean sounds its thunder,<br>the ocean sounds its pounding.
Above the thunder of the mighty waters,<br>more majestic than the breakers of the sea<br>is the L<small>ORD</small>, majestic on high.
Your decrees are indeed enduring;<br>holiness befits Your house,<br>O L<small>ORD</small>, for all times.

Chapter 94

God of retribution, L<small>ORD</small>,<br>God of retribution, appear!
Rise up, judge of the earth,<br>give the arrogant their deserts!
How long shall the wicked, O L<small>ORD</small>,<br>how long shall the wicked exult,
shall they utter insolent speech,<br>shall all evildoers vaunt themselves?
They crush Your people, O L<small>ORD</small>,<br>they afflict Your very own;
they kill the widow and the stranger;<br>they murder the fatherless,
thinking, “The L<small>ORD</small> does not see it,<br>the God of Jacob does not pay heed.”<br>
Take heed, you most brutish people;<br>fools, when will you get wisdom?
Shall He who implants the ear not hear,<br>He who forms the eye not see?
Shall He who disciplines nations not punish,<br>He who instructs men in knowledge?
The L<small>ORD</small> knows the designs of men to be futile.<br>
Happy is the man whom You discipline, O L<small>ORD</small>,<br>the man You instruct in Your teaching,
to give him tranquillity in times of misfortune,<br>until a pit be dug for the wicked.
For the L<small>ORD</small> will not forsake His people;<br>He will not abandon His very own.
Judgment shall again accord with justice<br>and all the upright shall rally to it.<br>
Who will take my part against evil men?<br>Who will stand up for me against wrongdoers?
Were not the L<small>ORD</small> my help,<br>I should soon dwell in silence.
When I think my foot has given way,<br>Your faithfulness, O L<small>ORD</small>, supports me.
When I am filled with cares,<br>Your assurance soothes my soul.<br>
Shall the seat of injustice be Your partner,<br>that frames mischief by statute?
They band together to do away with the righteous;<br>they condemn the innocent to death.
But the L<small>ORD</small> is my haven;<br>my God is my sheltering rock.
He will make their evil recoil upon them,<br>annihilate them through their own wickedness;<br>the L<small>ORD</small> our God will annihilate them.

Chapter 95

Come, let us sing joyously to the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>raise a shout for our rock and deliverer;
let us come into His presence with praise;<br>let us raise a shout for Him in song!
For the L<small>ORD</small> is a great God,<br>the great king of all divine beings.
In His hand are the depths of the earth;<br>the peaks of the mountains are His.
His is the sea, He made it;<br>and the land, which His hands fashioned.<br>
Come, let us bow down and kneel,<br>bend the knee before the L<small>ORD</small> our maker,
for He is our God,<br>and we are the people He tends, the flock in His care.<br>O, if you would but heed His charge this day:
Do not be stubborn as at Meribah,<br>as on the day of Massah, in the wilderness,
when your fathers put Me to the test,<br>tried Me, though they had seen My deeds.
Forty years I was provoked by that generation;<br>I thought, “They are a senseless people;<br>they would not know My ways.”
Concerning them I swore in anger,<br>“They shall never come to My resting-place!”

Chapter 96

<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. 1 Chron. 16.23–33.</i>Sing to the L<small>ORD</small> a new song,<br>sing to the L<small>ORD</small>, all the earth.
Sing to the L<small>ORD</small>, bless His name,<br>proclaim His victory day after day.
Tell of His glory among the nations,<br>His wondrous deeds, among all peoples.
For the L<small>ORD</small> is great and much acclaimed,<br>He is held in awe by all divine beings.
All the gods of the peoples are mere idols,<br>but the L<small>ORD</small> made the heavens.
Glory and majesty are before Him;<br>strength and splendor are in His temple.<br>
Ascribe to the L<small>ORD</small>, O families of the peoples,<br>ascribe to the L<small>ORD</small> glory and strength.
Ascribe to the L<small>ORD</small> the glory of His name,<br>bring tribute and enter His courts.
Bow down to the L<small>ORD</small> majestic in holiness;<br>tremble in His presence, all the earth!
Declare among the nations, “The L<small>ORD</small> is king!”<br>the world stands firm; it cannot be shaken;<br>He judges the peoples with equity.
Let the heavens rejoice and the earth exult;<br>let the sea and all within it thunder,
the fields and everything in them exult;<br>then shall all the trees of the forest shout for joy
at the presence of the L<small>ORD</small>, for He is coming,<br>for He is coming to rule the earth;<br>He will rule the world justly,<br>and its peoples in faithfulness.

Chapter 97

The L<small>ORD</small> is king!<br>Let the earth exult,<br>the many islands rejoice!
Dense clouds are around Him,<br>righteousness and justice are the base of His throne.
Fire is His vanguard,<br>burning His foes on every side.
His lightnings light up the world;<br>the earth is convulsed at the sight;
mountains melt like wax at the L<small>ORD</small>’s presence,<br>at the presence of the Lord of all the earth.
The heavens proclaim His righteousness<br>and all peoples see His glory.
All who worship images,<br>who vaunt their idols,<br>are dismayed;<br>all divine beings bow down to Him.
Zion, hearing it, rejoices,<br>the towns<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Or “women.”</i> of Judah exult,<br>because of Your judgments, O L<small>ORD</small>.
For You, L<small>ORD</small>, are supreme over all the earth;<br>You are exalted high above all divine beings.<br>
O you who love the L<small>ORD</small>, hate evil!<br>He guards the lives of His loyal ones,<br>saving them from the hand of the wicked.
Light is sown for the righteous,<br>radiance<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Others “joy.”</i> for the upright.
O you righteous, rejoice in the L<small>ORD</small><br>and acclaim His holy name!

Chapter 98

A psalm.<br><br>Sing to the L<small>ORD</small> a new song,<br>for He has worked wonders;<br>His right hand, His holy arm,<br>has won Him victory.
The L<small>ORD</small> has manifested His victory,<br>has displayed His triumph in the sight of the nations.
He was mindful of His steadfast love and faithfulness toward the house of Israel;<br>all the ends of the earth beheld the victory of our God.
Raise a shout to the L<small>ORD</small>, all the earth,<br>break into joyous songs of praise!
Sing praise to the L<small>ORD</small> with the lyre,<br>with the lyre and melodious song.

He spoke to them in a pillar of cloud;<br>they obeyed His decrees,<br>the law He gave them.
O L<small>ORD</small> our God, You answered them;<br>You were a forgiving God for them,<br>but You exacted retribution for their misdeeds.<br>

Of David. A psalm.<br><br>I will sing of faithfulness and justice;<br>I will chant a hymn to You, O L<small>ORD</small>.
I will study the way of the blameless;<br>when shall I attain it?<br>I will live without blame within my house.
I will not set before my eyes anything base;<br>I hate crooked dealing;<br>I will have none of it.
Perverse thoughts will be far from me;<br>I will know nothing of evil.
He who slanders his friend in secret I will destroy;<br>I cannot endure the haughty and proud man.
My eyes are on the trusty men of the land,<br>to have them at my side.<br>He who follows the way of the blameless<br>shall be in my service.
He who deals deceitfully<br>shall not live in my house;<br>he who speaks untruth<br>shall not stand before my eyes.
Each morning I will destroy<br>all the wicked of the land,<br>to rid the city of the L<small>ORD</small><br>of all evildoers.

Chapter 102

A prayer of the lowly man when he is faint and pours forth his plea before the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>
O L<small>ORD</small>, hear my prayer;<br>let my cry come before You.
Do not hide Your face from me<br>in my time of trouble;<br>turn Your ear to me;<br>when I cry, answer me speedily.
For my days have vanished like smoke<br>and my bones are charred like a hearth.
My body is stricken and withered like grass;<br><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Others “I forget.”</i>too wasted<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> to eat my food;
on account of my vehement groaning<br>my bones <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “cling to my flesh.”</i>show through my skin.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
I am like a great owl in the wilderness,<br>an owl among the ruins.
I lie awake; I am like<br>a lone bird upon a roof.
All day long my enemies revile me;<br>my deriders use my name to curse.
For I have eaten ashes like bread<br>and mixed my drink with tears,
because of Your wrath and Your fury;<br>for You have cast me far away.
My days are like a lengthening shadow;<br>I wither like grass.<br>
But You, O L<small>ORD</small>, are enthroned forever;<br>Your fame endures throughout the ages.
You will surely arise and take pity on Zion,<br>for it is time to be gracious to her;<br>the appointed time has come.
Your servants take delight in its stones,<br>and cherish its dust.
The nations will fear the name of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>all the kings of the earth, Your glory.
For the L<small>ORD</small> has built Zion;<br>He has appeared in all His glory.
He has turned to the prayer <sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>of the destitute<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup><br>and has not spurned their prayer.
May this be written down for a coming generation,<br>that people yet to be created may praise the L<small>ORD</small>.
For He looks down from His holy height;<br>the L<small>ORD</small> beholds the earth from heaven
to hear the groans of the prisoner,<br>to release those condemned to death;
that the fame of the L<small>ORD</small> may be recounted in Zion,<br>His praises in Jerusalem,
when the nations gather together,<br>the kingdoms, to serve the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>
He drained my strength in mid-course,<br>He shortened my days.
I say, “O my God, do not take me away<br>in the midst of my days,<br>You whose years go on for generations on end.
Of old You established the earth;<br>the heavens are the work of Your hands.
They shall perish, but You shall endure;<br>they shall all wear out like a garment;<br>You change them like clothing and they pass away.
But You are the same, and Your years never end.
May the children of Your servants dwell securely<br>and their offspring endure in Your presence.”

Chapter 103

Of David.<br><br>Bless the L<small>ORD</small>, O my soul,<br>all my being, His holy name.
Bless the L<small>ORD</small>, O my soul<br>and do not forget all His bounties.
He forgives all your sins,<br>heals all your diseases.
He redeems your life from the Pit,<br>surrounds you with steadfast love and mercy.
He satisfies you with good things in <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>the prime of life,<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br>so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.<br>
The L<small>ORD</small> executes righteous acts<br>and judgments for all who are wronged.
He made known His ways to Moses,<br>His deeds to the children of Israel.
The L<small>ORD</small> is compassionate and gracious,<br>slow to anger, abounding in steadfast love.
He will not contend forever,<br>or nurse His anger for all time.
He has not dealt with us according to our sins,<br>nor has He requited us according to our iniquities.
For as the heavens are high above the earth,<br>so great is His steadfast love toward those who fear Him.
As east is far from west,<br>so far has He removed our sins from us.
As a father has compassion for his children,<br>so the L<small>ORD</small> has compassion for those who fear Him.
For He knows how we are formed;<br>He is mindful that we are dust.<br>
Man, his days are like those of grass;<br>he blooms like a flower of the field;
a wind passes by and it is no more,<br>its own place no longer knows it.
But the L<small>ORD</small>’s steadfast love is for all eternity<br>toward those who fear Him,<br>and His beneficence is for the children’s children
of those who keep His covenant<br>and remember to observe His precepts.
The L<small>ORD</small> has established His throne in heaven,<br>and His sovereign rule is over all.<br>
Bless the L<small>ORD</small>, O His angels,<br>mighty creatures who do His bidding,<br>ever obedient to His bidding;
bless the L<small>ORD</small>, all His hosts,<br>His servants who do His will;
bless the L<small>ORD</small>, all His works,<br>through the length and breadth of His realm;<br>bless the L<small>ORD</small>, O my soul.

Chapter 104

Bless the L<small>ORD</small>, O my soul;<br>O L<small>ORD</small>, my God, You are very great;<br>You are clothed in glory and majesty,
wrapped in a robe of light;<br>You spread the heavens like a tent cloth.
He sets the rafters of His lofts in the waters,<br>makes the clouds His chariot,<br>moves on the wings of the wind.
He makes the winds His messengers,<br>fiery flames His servants.
He established the earth on its foundations,<br>so that it shall never totter.
You made the deep cover it as a garment;<br>the waters stood above the mountains.
They fled at Your blast,<br>rushed away at the sound of Your thunder,
—mountains rising, valleys sinking—<br>to the place You established for them.
You set bounds they must not pass<br>so that they never again cover the earth.<br>
You make springs gush forth in torrents;<br>they make their way between the hills,
giving drink to all the wild beasts;<br>the wild asses slake their thirst.
The birds of the sky dwell beside them<br>and sing among the foliage.
You water the mountains from Your<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “His.”</i> lofts;<br>the earth is sated from the fruit of Your work.
You make the grass grow for the cattle,<br>and herbage for man’s labor<br>that he may get food out of the earth—
wine that cheers the hearts of men,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “to make the face shine from oil.”</i>oil that makes the face shine,<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>and bread that sustains man’s life.
The trees of the L<small>ORD</small> drink their fill,<br>the cedars of Lebanon, His own planting,
where birds make their nests;<br>the stork has her home in the junipers.
The high mountains are for wild goats;<br>the crags are a refuge for rock-badgers.<br>
He made the moon to mark the seasons;<br>the sun knows when to set.
You bring on darkness and it is night,<br>when all the beasts of the forests stir.
The lions roar for prey,<br>seeking their food from God.
When the sun rises, they come home<br>and couch in their dens.
Man then goes out to his work,<br>to his labor until the evening.<br>
How many are the things You have made, O L<small>ORD</small>;<br>You have made them all with wisdom;<br>the earth is full of Your creations.
There is the sea, vast and wide,<br>with its creatures beyond number,<br>living things, small and great.
There go the ships,<br>and Leviathan that You formed to sport with.
All of them look to You<br>to give them their food when it is due.
Give it to them, they gather it up;<br>open Your hand, they are well satisfied;
hide Your face, they are terrified;<br>take away their breath, they perish<br>and turn again into dust;
send back Your breath, they are created,<br>and You renew the face of the earth.<br>
May the glory of the L<small>ORD</small> endure forever;<br>may the L<small>ORD</small> rejoice in His works!
He looks at the earth and it trembles;<br>He touches the mountains and they smoke.<br>
I will sing to the L<small>ORD</small> as long as I live;<br>all my life I will chant hymns to my God.
May my prayer be pleasing to Him;<br>I will rejoice in the L<small>ORD</small>.
May sinners disappear from the earth,<br>and the wicked be no more.<br>Bless the L<small>ORD</small>, O my soul.<br>Hallelujah.

Chapter 105

Praise the L<small>ORD</small>;<br>call on His name;<br>proclaim His deeds among the peoples.
Sing praises to Him;<br>speak of all His wondrous acts.
Exult in His holy name;<br>let all who seek the L<small>ORD</small> rejoice.
Turn to the L<small>ORD</small>, to His might;<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Ark; cf. Ps. 78.61; 132.8.</i><br>seek His presence constantly.
Remember the wonders He has done,<br>His portents and the judgments He has pronounced,
O offspring of Abraham, His servant,<br>O descendants of Jacob, His chosen ones.
He is the L<small>ORD</small> our God;<br>His judgments are throughout the earth.
He is ever mindful of His covenant,<br>the promise He gave for a thousand generations,
that He made with Abraham,<br>swore to Isaac,
and confirmed in a decree for Jacob,<br>for Israel, as an eternal covenant,
saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan<br>as your allotted heritage.”<br>
They were then few in number,<br>a mere handful, sojourning there,
wandering from nation to nation,<br>from one kingdom to another.
He allowed no one to oppress them;<br>He reproved kings on their account,
“Do not touch My anointed ones;<br>do not harm My prophets.”<br>
He called down a famine on the land,<br>destroyed every staff of bread.
He sent ahead of them a man,<br>Joseph, sold into slavery.
His feet were subjected to fetters;<br>an iron collar was put on his neck.
Until his prediction came true<br>the decree of the L<small>ORD</small> purged him.
The king sent to have him freed;<br>the ruler of nations released him.
He made him the lord of his household,<br>empowered him over all his possessions,
to discipline his princes at will,<br>to teach his elders wisdom.
Then Israel came to Egypt;<br>Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.<br>
He made His people very fruitful,<br>more numerous than their foes.
<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Or “Their heart changed.”</i>He changed their heart<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup> to hate His people,<br>to plot against His servants.
He sent His servant Moses,<br>and Aaron, whom He had chosen.
They performed His signs among them,<br>His wonders, against the land of Ham.
He sent darkness; it was very dark;<br><sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>did they not defy His word?<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup>
He turned their waters into blood<br>and killed their fish.
Their land teemed with frogs,<br>even the rooms of their king.
Swarms of insects came at His command,<br>lice, throughout their country.
He gave them hail for rain,<br>and flaming fire in their land.
He struck their vines and fig trees,<br>broke down the trees of their country.
Locusts came at His command,<br>grasshoppers without number.
They devoured every green thing in the land;<br>they consumed the produce of the soil.
He struck down every first-born in the land,<br>the first fruit of their vigor.
He led Israel<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “them.”</i> out with silver and gold;<br>none among their tribes faltered.
Egypt rejoiced when they left,<br>for dread of Israel<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “them.”</i> had fallen upon them.<br>
He spread a cloud for a cover,<br>and fire to light up the night.
They asked and He brought them quail,<br>and satisfied them with food from heaven.
He opened a rock so that water gushed forth;<br>it flowed as a stream in the parched land.
Mindful of His sacred promise<br>to His servant Abraham,
He led His people out in gladness,<br>His chosen ones with joyous song.
He gave them the lands of nations;<br>they inherited the wealth of peoples,
that they might keep His laws<br>and observe His teachings.<br>Hallelujah.

Chapter 106

Hallelujah.<br>Praise the L<small>ORD</small> for He is good;<br>His steadfast love is eternal.
Who can tell the mighty acts of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>proclaim all His praises?<br>
Happy are those who act justly,<br>who do right at all times.
Be mindful of me, O L<small>ORD</small>, when You favor Your people;<br>take note of me when You deliver them,
that I may enjoy the prosperity of Your chosen ones,<br>share the joy of Your nation,<br>glory in Your very own people.<br>
We have sinned like our forefathers;<br>we have gone astray, done evil.
Our forefathers in Egypt did not perceive Your wonders;<br>they did not remember Your abundant love,<br>but rebelled at the sea, at the Sea of Reeds.
Yet He saved them, as befits His name,<br>to make known His might.
He sent His blast against the Sea of Reeds;<br>it became dry;<br>He led them through the deep as through a wilderness.
He delivered them from the foe,<br>redeemed them from the enemy.
Water covered their adversaries;<br>not one of them was left.
Then they believed His promise,<br>and sang His praises.
But they soon forgot His deeds;<br>they would not wait to learn His plan.
They were seized with craving in the wilderness,<br>and put God to the test in the wasteland.
He gave them what they asked for,<br>then made them waste away.
There was envy of Moses in the camp,<br>and of Aaron, the holy one of the L<small>ORD</small>.
The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan,<br>closed over the party of Abiram.
A fire blazed among their party,<br>a flame that consumed the wicked.
They made a calf at Horeb<br>and bowed down to a molten image.
They exchanged their glory<br>for the image of a bull that feeds on grass.
They forgot God who saved them,<br>who performed great deeds in Egypt,
wondrous deeds in the land of Ham,<br>awesome deeds at the Sea of Reeds.
He would have destroyed them<br>had not Moses His chosen one<br>confronted Him in the breach<br>to avert His destructive wrath.
They rejected the desirable land,<br>and put no faith in His promise.
They grumbled in their tents<br>and disobeyed the L<small>ORD</small>.
So He raised His hand in oath<br>to make them fall in the wilderness,
to disperse<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Targum, Kimhi.</i> their offspring among the nations<br>and scatter them through the lands.
They attached themselves to Baal Peor,<br>ate sacrifices offered to the dead.
They provoked anger by their deeds,<br>and a plague broke out among them.
Phinehas stepped forth and intervened,<br>and the plague ceased.
It was reckoned to his merit<br>for all generations, to eternity.
They provoked wrath at the waters of Meribah<br>and Moses suffered on their account,
because they rebelled against Him<br>and he spoke rashly.<br>
They did not destroy the nations<br>as the L<small>ORD</small> had commanded them,
but mingled with the nations<br>and learned their ways.
They worshiped their idols,<br>which became a snare for them.
Their own sons and daughters<br>they sacrificed to demons.
They shed innocent blood,<br>the blood of their sons and daughters,<br>whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan;<br>so the land was polluted with bloodguilt.
Thus they became defiled by their acts,<br>debauched through their deeds.
The L<small>ORD</small> was angry with His people<br>and He abhorred His inheritance.
He handed them over to the nations;<br>their foes ruled them.
Their enemies oppressed them<br>and they were subject to their power.
He saved them time and again,<br>but they were deliberately rebellious,<br>and so they were brought low by their iniquity.
When He saw that they were in distress,<br>when He heard their cry,
He was mindful of His covenant<br>and in His great faithfulness relented.
He made all their captors kindly disposed toward them.<br>
Deliver us, O L<small>ORD</small> our God,<br>and gather us from among the nations,<br>to acclaim Your holy name,<br>to glory in Your praise.<br>
Blessed is the L<small>ORD</small>, God of Israel,<br>From eternity to eternity.<br>Let all the people say, “Amen.”<br>Hallelujah.

Chapter 107

“Praise the L<small>ORD</small>, for He is good;<br>His steadfast love is eternal!”
Thus let the redeemed of the L<small>ORD</small> say,<br>those He redeemed from adversity,
whom He gathered in from the lands,<br>from east and west,<br>from the north and from the sea.<br>
Some lost their way in the wilderness,<br>in the wasteland;<br>they found no settled place.
Hungry and thirsty,<br>their spirit failed.
In their adversity they cried to the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>and He rescued them from their troubles.
He showed them a direct way<br>to reach a settled place.
Let them praise the L<small>ORD</small> for His steadfast love,<br>His wondrous deeds for mankind;
for He has satisfied the thirsty,<br>filled the hungry with all good things.<br>
Some lived in deepest darkness,<br>bound in cruel irons,
because they defied the word of God,<br>spurned the counsel of the Most High.
He humbled their hearts through suffering;<br>they stumbled with no one to help.
In their adversity they cried to the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>and He rescued them from their troubles.
He brought them out of deepest darkness,<br>broke their bonds asunder.
Let them praise the L<small>ORD</small> for His steadfast love,<br>His wondrous deeds for mankind;
for He shattered gates of bronze,<br>He broke their iron bars.<br>
There were fools who suffered for their sinful way,<br>and for their iniquities.
All food was loathsome to them;<br>they reached the gates of death.
In their adversity they cried to the L<small>ORD</small><br>and He saved them from their troubles.
He gave an order and healed them;<br>He delivered them from the pits.<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Viz., of death.</i>
Let them praise the L<small>ORD</small> for His steadfast love,<br>His wondrous deeds for mankind.
Let them offer thanksgiving sacrifices,<br>and tell His deeds in joyful song.<br>
Others go down to the sea in ships,<br>ply their trade in the mighty waters;
they have seen the works of the L<small>ORD</small><br>and His wonders in the deep.
By His word He raised a storm wind<br>that made the waves surge.
Mounting up to the heaven,<br>plunging down to the depths,<br>disgorging in their misery,
they reeled and staggered like a drunken man,<br>all their skill to no avail.
In their adversity they cried to the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>and He saved them from their troubles.
He reduced the storm to a whisper;<br>the waves were stilled.
They rejoiced when all was quiet,<br>and He brought them to the port they desired.
Let them praise the L<small>ORD</small> for His steadfast love,<br>His wondrous deeds for mankind.
Let them exalt Him in the congregation of the people,<br>acclaim Him in the assembly of the elders.<br>
He turns the rivers into a wilderness,<br>springs of water into thirsty land,
fruitful land into a salt marsh,<br>because of the wickedness of its inhabitants.
He turns the wilderness into pools,<br>parched land into springs of water.
There He settles the hungry;<br>they build a place to settle in.
They sow fields and plant vineyards<br>that yield a fruitful harvest.
He blesses them and they increase greatly;<br>and He does not let their cattle decrease,
after they had been few and crushed<br>by oppression, misery, and sorrow.
He pours contempt on great men<br>and makes them lose their way in trackless deserts;
but the needy He secures from suffering,<br>and increases their families like flocks.<br>
The upright see it and rejoice;<br>the mouth of all wrongdoers is stopped.
The wise man will take note of these things;<br>he will consider the steadfast love of the L<small>ORD</small>.

Chapter 108

A song. A psalm of David.<br>
<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">With vv. 2–6, cf. Ps. 57.8–12.</i>My heart is firm, O God;<br>I will sing and chant a hymn with all my soul.
Awake, O harp and lyre!<br>I will wake the dawn.
I will praise You among the peoples, O L<small>ORD</small>,<br>sing a hymn to You among the nations;
for Your faithfulness is higher than the heavens;<br>Your steadfastness reaches to the sky.
Exalt Yourself over the heavens, O God;<br>let Your glory be over all the earth!
<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">With vv. 7–14, cf. Ps. 60.7–14.</i>That those whom You love may be rescued,<br>deliver with Your right hand and answer me.<br>
God promised <sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Or “by His holiness.”</i>in His sanctuary<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup><br>that I would exultingly divide up Shechem,<br>and measure the Valley of Sukkoth;
Gilead and Manasseh would be mine,<br>Ephraim my chief stronghold,<br>Judah my scepter;
Moab would be my washbasin;<br>on Edom I would cast my shoe;<br>I would raise a shout over Philistia.
Would that I were brought to the bastion!<br>Would that I were led to Edom!<br>
But You have rejected us, O God;<br>God, You do not march with our armies.
Grant us Your aid against the foe,<br>for the help of man is worthless.
With God we shall triumph;<br>He will trample our foes.

Chapter 109

For the leader. Of David. A psalm.<br><br>O God of my praise,<br>do not keep aloof,
for the wicked and the deceitful<br>open their mouth against me;<br>they speak to me with lying tongue.
They encircle me with words of hate;<br>they attack me without cause.
They answer my love with accusation<br><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Or “but I am all prayer”; meaning of Heb. uncertain, but see v. 7.</i>and I must stand judgment.<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Or “but I am all prayer”; meaning of Heb. uncertain, but see v. 7.</i>
They repay me with evil for good,<br>with hatred for my love.<br>
Appoint a wicked man over him;<br>may an accuser stand at his right side;
may he be tried and convicted;<br>may he be judged and found guilty.
May his days be few;<br>may another take over <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>his position.<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
May his children be orphans,<br>his wife a widow.
May his children wander from their hovels,<br>begging in search of [bread].
May his creditor seize all his possessions;<br>may strangers plunder his wealth.
May no one show him mercy;<br>may none pity his orphans;
may his posterity be cut off;<br>may their names be blotted out in the next generation.
May God be ever mindful of his father’s iniquity,<br>and may the sin of his mother not be blotted out.
May the L<small>ORD</small> be aware of them always<br>and cause their names to be cut off from the earth,
because he was not minded to act kindly,<br>and hounded to death the poor and needy man,<br>one crushed in spirit.
He loved to curse—may a curse come upon him!<br>He would not bless—may blessing be far from him!
May he be clothed in a curse like a garment,<br>may it enter his body like water,<br>his bones like oil.
Let it be like the cloak he wraps around him,<br>like the belt he always wears.
May the L<small>ORD</small> thus repay my accusers,<br>all those who speak evil against me.<br>
Now You, O God, my Lord,<br>act on my behalf as befits Your name.<br>Good and faithful as You are, save me.
For I am poor and needy,<br>and my heart is pierced within me.
I fade away like a lengthening shadow;<br>I am shaken off like locusts.
My knees give way from fasting;<br>my flesh is lean, has lost its fat.
I am the object of their scorn;<br>when they see me, they shake their head.
Help me, O L<small>ORD</small>, my God;<br>save me in accord with Your faithfulness,
that men may know that it is Your hand,<br>that You, O L<small>ORD</small>, have done it.
Let them curse, but You bless;<br>let them rise up, but come to grief,<br>while Your servant rejoices.
My accusers shall be clothed in shame,<br>wrapped in their disgrace as in a robe.<br>
My mouth shall sing much praise to the L<small>ORD</small>;<br>I will acclaim Him in the midst of a throng,
because He stands at the right hand of the needy,<br>to save him from those who would condemn him.

Chapter 110

Of David. A psalm.<br><br>The L<small>ORD</small> said to my lord,<br>“Sit at My right hand<br>while I make your enemies your footstool.”<br>
The L<small>ORD</small> will stretch forth from Zion your mighty scepter;<br>hold sway over your enemies!
<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Your people come forward willingly on your day of battle.<br>In majestic holiness, from the womb,<br>from the dawn, yours was the dew of youth.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br>

The Lord is at your right hand.<br>He crushes kings in the day of His anger.<br>
He works judgment upon the nations,<br>heaping up bodies,<br>crushing heads far and wide.
He drinks from the stream on his way;<br>therefore he holds his head high.

Chapter 111

Hallelujah.<br>I praise the L<small>ORD</small> with all my heart<br>in the assembled congregation of the upright.
The works of the L<small>ORD</small> are great,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>within reach of all who desire them.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>
His deeds are splendid and glorious;<br>His beneficence is everlasting;
He has won renown for His wonders.<br>The L<small>ORD</small> is gracious and compassionate;
He gives food to those who fear Him;<br>He is ever mindful of His covenant.
He revealed to His people His powerful works,<br>in giving them the heritage of nations.
His handiwork is truth and justice;<br>all His precepts are enduring,
well-founded for all eternity,<br>wrought of truth and equity.
He sent redemption to His people;<br>He ordained His covenant for all time;<br>His name is holy and awesome.
The beginning<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Or “chief part.”</i> of wisdom is the fear of the L<small>ORD</small>;<br>all who practice it gain sound understanding.<br>Praise of Him is everlasting.

Chapter 112

Hallelujah.<br>Happy is the man who fears the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>who is ardently devoted to His commandments.
His descendants will be mighty in the land,<br><br>a blessed generation of upright men.
Wealth and riches are in his house,<br>and his beneficence lasts forever.
<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Or “He shines as a light.”</i>A light shines<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> for the upright in the darkness;<br>he is gracious, compassionate, and beneficent.
All goes well with the man who lends generously,<br>who conducts his affairs with equity.
He shall never be shaken;<br>the beneficent man will be remembered forever.
He is not afraid of evil tidings;<br>his heart is firm, he trusts in the L<small>ORD</small>.
His heart is resolute, he is unafraid;<br>in the end he will see the fall of his foes.
He gives freely to the poor;<br>his beneficence lasts forever;<br>his horn is exalted in honor.
The wicked man shall see it and be vexed;<br>he shall gnash his teeth; his courage shall fail.<br>The desire of the wicked shall come to nothing.

Chapter 113

Hallelujah.<br>O servants of the L<small>ORD</small>, give praise;<br>praise the name of the L<small>ORD</small>.
Let the name of the L<small>ORD</small> be blessed<br>now and forever.
From east to west<br>the name of the L<small>ORD</small> is praised.
The L<small>ORD</small> is exalted above all nations;<br>His glory is above the heavens.
Who is like the L<small>ORD</small> our God,<br>who, enthroned on high,
sees what is below,<br>in heaven and on earth?
He raises the poor from the dust,<br>lifts up the needy from the refuse heap
to set them with the great,<br>with the great men of His people.
He sets the childless woman among her household<br>as a happy mother of children.<br>Hallelujah.

Chapter 114

When Israel went forth from Egypt,<br>the house of Jacob from a people of strange speech,
Judah became His <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Or “sanctuary.”</i>holy one,<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br>Israel, His dominion.
The sea saw them and fled,<br>Jordan ran backward,
mountains skipped like rams,<br>hills like sheep.
What alarmed you, O sea, that you fled,<br>Jordan, that you ran backward,
mountains, that you skipped like rams,<br>hills, like sheep?
Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord,<br>at the presence of the God of Jacob,
who turned the rock into a pool of water,<br>the flinty rock into a fountain.

Chapter 115

Not to us, O L<small>ORD</small>, not to us<br>but to Your name bring glory<br>for the sake of Your love and Your faithfulness.
Let the nations not say,<br>“Where, now, is their God?”
when our God is in heaven<br>and all that He wills He accomplishes.

they have hands, but cannot touch,<br>feet, but cannot walk;<br>they can make no sound in their throats.
Those who fashion them,<br>all who trust in them,<br>shall become like them.
O Israel, trust in the L<small>ORD</small>!<br>He is their help and shield.
O house of Aaron, trust in the L<small>ORD</small>!<br>He is their help and shield.
O you who fear the L<small>ORD</small>, trust in the L<small>ORD</small>!<br>He is their help and shield.<br>

Chapter 120

A song of ascents.<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">A term of uncertain meaning.</i><br><br>In my distress I called to the L<small>ORD</small><br>and He answered me.
O L<small>ORD</small>, save me from treacherous lips,<br>from a deceitful tongue!
What can you profit,<br>what can you gain,<br>O deceitful tongue?
A warrior’s sharp arrows,<br>with hot coals of broom-wood.<br>
Woe is me, that I live with Meshech,<br>that I dwell among the clans of Kedar.
Too long have I dwelt with those who hate peace.
I am all peace;<br>but when I speak,<br>they are for war.

Chapter 121

A song for ascents.<br><br>I turn my eyes to the mountains;<br>from where will my help come?
My help comes from the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>maker of heaven and earth.
He will not let your foot give way;<br>your guardian will not slumber;
See, the guardian of Israel<br>neither slumbers nor sleeps!
The L<small>ORD</small> is your guardian,<br>the L<small>ORD</small> is your protection<br>at your right hand.
By day the sun will not strike you,<br>nor the moon by night.
The L<small>ORD</small> will guard you from all harm;<br>He will guard your life.

Chapter 122

A song of ascents. Of David. I rejoiced when they said to me,<br>“We are going to the House of the L<small>ORD</small>.”
Our feet stood inside your gates, O Jerusalem,
Jerusalem built up, a city knit together,
to which tribes would make pilgrimage,<br>the tribes of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>—as was enjoined upon Israel—<br>to praise the name of the L<small>ORD</small>.
There the thrones of judgment stood,<br>thrones of the house of David.
Pray for the well-being of Jerusalem;<br>“May those who love you be at peace.
May there be well-being within your ramparts,<br>peace in your citadels.”
For the sake of my kin and friends,<br>I pray for your well-being;
for the sake of the house of the L<small>ORD</small> our God,<br>I seek your good.

Chapter 123

A song of ascents.<br><br>To You, enthroned in heaven,<br>I turn my eyes.
As the eyes of slaves follow their master’s hand,<br>as the eyes of a slave-girl follow the hand of her mistress,<br>so our eyes are toward the L<small>ORD</small> our God,<br>awaiting His favor.
Show us favor, O L<small>ORD</small>,<br>show us favor!<br>We have had more than enough of contempt.
Long enough have we endured<br>the scorn of the complacent,<br>the contempt of the haughty.

Chapter 124

A song of ascents. Of David.<br><br>Were it not for the L<small>ORD</small>, who was on our side,<br>let Israel now declare,
were it not for the L<small>ORD</small>, who was on our side<br>when men assailed us,
they would have swallowed us alive<br>in their burning rage against us;
the waters would have carried us off,<br>the torrent would have swept over us;
over us would have swept<br>the seething waters.
Blessed is the L<small>ORD</small>, who did not let us<br>be ripped apart by their teeth.
We are like a bird escaped from the fowler’s trap;<br>the trap broke and we escaped.
Our help is the name of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>maker of heaven and earth.

Chapter 125

A song of ascents.<br><br>Those who trust in the L<small>ORD</small><br>are like Mount Zion<br>that cannot be moved,<br>enduring forever.
Jerusalem, hills enfold it,<br>and the L<small>ORD</small> enfolds His people<br>now and forever.
<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>The scepter of the wicked shall never rest<br>upon the land allotted to the righteous,<br>that the righteous not set their hand to wrongdoing.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>

our mouths shall be filled with laughter,<br>our tongues, with songs of joy.<br>Then shall they say among the nations,<br>“The L<small>ORD</small> has done great things for them!”
The L<small>ORD</small> will do great things for us<br>and we shall rejoice.
Restore our fortunes, O L<small>ORD</small>,<br>like watercourses in the Negeb.
They who sow in tears<br>shall reap with songs of joy.
Though he goes along weeping,<br>carrying the seed-bag,<br>he shall come back with songs of joy,<br>carrying his sheaves.

Chapter 127

A song of ascents. Of Solomon.<br><br>Unless the L<small>ORD</small> builds the house,<br>its builders labor in vain on it;<br>unless the L<small>ORD</small> watches over the city,<br>the watchman keeps vigil in vain.
In vain do you rise early<br>and stay up late,<br>you who toil for the bread you eat;<br><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>He provides as much for His loved ones while they sleep.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup><br>
Sons are the provision<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “heritage.”</i> of the L<small>ORD</small>;<br>the fruit of the womb, His reward.
Like arrows in the hand of a warrior<br>are sons born to a man in his youth.
Happy is the man who fills his quiver with them;<br>they shall not be put to shame<br>when they contend with the enemy in the gate.

Chapter 128

A song of ascents.<br><br>Happy are all who fear the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>who follow His ways.
You shall enjoy the fruit of your labors;<br>you shall be happy and you shall prosper.
Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine within your house;<br>your sons, like olive saplings around your table.
So shall the man who fears the L<small>ORD</small> be blessed.<br>
May the L<small>ORD</small> bless you from Zion;<br>may you share the prosperity of Jerusalem<br>all the days of your life,
and live to see your children’s children.<br>May all be well with Israel!

Chapter 129

A song of ascents.<br><br>Since my youth they have often assailed me,<br>let Israel now declare,
since my youth they have often assailed me,<br>but they have never overcome me.
Plowmen plowed across my back;<br>they made long furrows.
The L<small>ORD</small>, the righteous one,<br>has snapped the cords of the wicked.
Let all who hate Zion<br>fall back in disgrace.
Let them be like grass on roofs<br>that fades before it can be pulled up,
that affords no handful for the reaper,<br>no armful for the gatherer of sheaves,
no exchange with passersby:<br>“The blessing of the L<small>ORD</small> be upon you.”<br>“We bless you by the name of the L<small>ORD</small>.”

Chapter 130

A song of ascents.<br><br>Out of the depths I call You, O L<small>ORD</small>.
O Lord, listen to my cry;<br>let Your ears be attentive<br>to my plea for mercy.
If You keep account of sins, O L<small>ORD</small>,<br>Lord, who will survive?
Yours is the power to forgive<br>so that You may be held in awe.<br>
I look to the L<small>ORD</small>;<br>I look to Him;<br>I await His word.
I am more eager for the Lord<br>than watchmen for the morning,<br>watchmen for the morning.<br>
O Israel, wait for the L<small>ORD</small>;<br>for with the L<small>ORD</small> is steadfast love<br>and great power to redeem.
It is He who will redeem Israel from all their iniquities.

Chapter 131

A song of ascents. Of David.<br><br>O L<small>ORD</small>, my heart is not proud<br>nor my look haughty;<br>I do not aspire to great things<br>or to what is beyond me;

Chapter 132

A song of ascents.<br><br>O L<small>ORD</small>, remember in David’s favor<br>his extreme self-denial,
how he swore to the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob,
“I will not enter my house,<br>nor will I mount my bed,
I will not give sleep to my eyes,<br>or slumber to my eyelids<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “eyes.”</i>
until I find a place for the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>an abode for the Mighty One of Jacob.”<br>
We heard it was in Ephrath;<br>we came upon it in the region of Jaar.<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. 1 Sam. 7.1–2; 1 Chron. 13.5–6.</i>
Let us enter His abode,<br>bow at His footstool.

Your priests are clothed in triumph;<br>Your loyal ones sing for joy.
For the sake of Your servant David<br>do not reject Your anointed one.<br>
The L<small>ORD</small> swore to David<br>a firm oath that He will not renounce,<br>“One of your own issue I will set upon your throne.
If your sons keep My covenant<br>and My decrees that I teach them,<br>then their sons also,<br>to the end of time,<br>shall sit upon your throne.”
For the L<small>ORD</small> has chosen Zion;<br>He has desired it for His seat.
“This is my resting-place for all time;<br>here I will dwell, for I desire it.
I will amply bless its store of food,<br>give its needy their fill of bread.
I will clothe its priests in victory,<br>its loyal ones shall sing for joy.
There I will make a horn sprout for David;<br>I have prepared a lamp for My anointed one.
I will clothe his enemies in disgrace,<br>while on him his crown shall sparkle.”

For I know that the L<small>ORD</small> is great,<br>that our Lord is greater than all gods.
Whatever the L<small>ORD</small> desires He does<br>in heaven and earth,<br>in the seas and all the depths.
He makes clouds rise from the end of the earth;<br>He makes lightning for the rain;<br>He releases the wind from His vaults.

By the rivers of Babylon,<br>there we sat,<br>sat and wept,<br>as we thought of Zion.
There on the poplars<br>we hung up our lyres,
for our captors asked us there for songs,<br>our tormentors,<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> for amusement:<br>“Sing us one of the songs of Zion.”
How can we sing a song of the L<small>ORD</small><br>on alien soil?
If I forget you, O Jerusalem,<br>let my right hand wither;<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Others “forget its cunning.”</i>
let my tongue stick to my palate<br>if I cease to think of you,<br>if I do not keep Jerusalem in memory<br>even at my happiest hour.<br>
Remember, O L<small>ORD</small>, against the Edomites<br>the day of Jerusalem’s fall;<br>how they cried, “Strip her, strip her<br>to her very foundations!”
Fair Babylon, you predator,<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">With Targum; others “who are to be destroyed.”</i><br>a blessing on him who repays you in kind<br>what you have inflicted on us;
a blessing on him who seizes your babies<br>and dashes them against the rocks!

Chapter 138

Of David.<br><br>I praise You with all my heart,<br>sing a hymn to You before the divine beings;
I bow toward Your holy temple<br>and praise Your name for Your steadfast love and faithfulness,<br>because You have exalted <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>Your name, Your word, above all.<sup>a</sup>
When I called, You answered me,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>You inspired me with courage.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>
All the kings of the earth shall praise You, O L<small>ORD</small>,<br>for they have heard the words You spoke.
They shall sing of the ways of the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>“Great is the majesty of the L<small>ORD</small>!”
High though the L<small>ORD</small> is, He sees the lowly;<br>lofty, He perceives from afar.
Though I walk among enemies,<br>You preserve me in the face of my foes;<br>You extend Your hand;<br>with Your right hand You deliver me.
The L<small>ORD</small> will settle accounts for me.<br>O L<small>ORD</small>, Your steadfast love is eternal;<br>do not forsake the work of Your hands.

Chapter 139

For the leader. Of David. A psalm.<br><br>O L<small>ORD</small>, You have examined me and know me.
When I sit down or stand up You know it;<br>You discern my thoughts from afar.
<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>You observe<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup> my walking and reclining,<br>and are familiar with all my ways.
There is not a word on my tongue<br>but that You, O L<small>ORD</small>, know it well.
You hedge me before and behind;<br>You lay Your hand upon me.
It is beyond my knowledge;<br>it is a mystery; I cannot fathom it.
Where can I escape from Your spirit?<br>Where can I flee from Your presence?
If I ascend to heaven, You are there;<br>if I descend to Sheol, You are there too.
If I take wing with the dawn<br>to come to rest on the western horizon,
even there Your hand will be guiding me,<br>Your right hand will be holding me fast.
If I say, “Surely darkness <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Rashi, Ibn Ezra; meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>will conceal me,<br>night will provide me with cover,”<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup>
darkness is not dark for You;<br>night is as light as day;<br>darkness and light are the same.
It was You who created my conscience;<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “kidneys.”</i><br>You fashioned me in my mother’s womb.
I praise You,<br>for I am awesomely, wondrously made;<br>Your work is wonderful;<br>I know it very well.
My frame was not concealed from You<br>when I was shaped in a hidden place,<br>knit together in the recesses of the earth.
Your eyes saw my unformed limbs;<br>they were all recorded in Your book;<br>in due time they were formed,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>to the very last one of them.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>
How weighty Your thoughts seem to me, O God,<br>how great their number!
I count them—they exceed the grains of sand;<br>I end—but am still with You.<br>
O God, if You would only slay the wicked—<br>you murderers, away from me!—
<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>who invoke You for intrigue,<br>Your enemies who swear by You falsely.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>
O L<small>ORD</small>, You know I hate those who hate You,<br>and loathe Your adversaries.
I feel a perfect hatred toward them;<br>I count them my enemies.<br>
Examine me, O God, and know my mind;<br>probe me and know my thoughts.
See if I have vexatious ways,<br>and guide me in ways everlasting.

Chapter 140

For the leader. A psalm of David.<br>
Rescue me, O L<small>ORD</small>, from evil men;<br>save me from the lawless,
whose minds are full of evil schemes,<br>who plot war every day.
They sharpen their tongues like serpents;<br>spiders’ poison is on their lips. <i>Selah</i>.<br>
O L<small>ORD</small>, keep me out of the clutches of the wicked;<br>save me from lawless men<br>who scheme to <sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “push my feet.”</i>make me fall.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>
Arrogant men laid traps with ropes for me;<br>they spread out a net along the way;<br>they set snares for me. <i>Selah</i>.<br>
I said to the L<small>ORD</small>: You are my God;<br>give ear, O L<small>ORD</small>, to my pleas for mercy.
O G<small>OD</small>, my Lord, the strength of my deliverance,<br>You protected my head on the day of battle.<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “arms.”</i>
O L<small>ORD</small>, do not grant the desires of the wicked;<br>do not let their plan succeed,<br><sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>else they be exalted. <i>Selah</i>.<br>
May the heads of those who beset me<br>be covered with the mischief of their lips.<sup class="endFootnote">-c</sup>
may coals of fire drop down upon them,<br>and they be cast into pits, never to rise again.
Let slanderers have no place in the land;<br>let the evil of the lawless man drive him into corrals.
I know that the L<small>ORD</small> will champion<br>the cause of the poor, the right of the needy.
Righteous men shall surely praise Your name;<br>the upright shall dwell in Your presence.

Chapter 141

A psalm of David.<br><br>I call You, O L<small>ORD</small>, hasten to me;<br>give ear to my cry when I call You.
Take my prayer as an offering of incense,<br>my upraised hands as an evening sacrifice.
O L<small>ORD</small>, set a guard over my mouth,<br>a watch at the door of my lips;
let my mind not turn to an evil thing,<br>to practice deeds of wickedness<br>with men who are evildoers;<br>let me not feast on their dainties.
<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of vv. 5–7 uncertain.</i>Let the righteous man strike me in loyalty,<br>let him reprove me;<br>let my head not refuse such choice oil.<br>My prayers are still against their<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the evildoers of v. 4.</i> evil deeds.
May their judges slip on the rock,<br>but let my words be heard, for they are sweet.
As when the earth is cleft and broken up<br>our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.
My eyes are fixed upon You, O G<small>OD</small> my Lord;<br>I seek refuge in You, do not put me in jeopardy.
Keep me from the trap laid for me,<br>and from the snares of evildoers.
Let the wicked fall into their nets<br>while I alone come through.

Chapter 142

A maskil of David, while he was in the cave.<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. 1 Sam. 24.3–4.</i> A prayer.<br>
I cry aloud to the L<small>ORD</small>;<br>I appeal to the L<small>ORD</small> loudly for mercy.
I pour out my complaint before Him;<br>I lay my trouble before Him
when my spirit fails within me.<br>You know my course;<br>they have laid a trap in the path I walk.
Look at my right and see—<br>I have no friend;<br>there is nowhere I can flee,<br>no one cares about me.
So I cry to You, O L<small>ORD</small>;<br>I say, “You are my refuge,<br>all I have in the land of the living.”
Listen to my cry, for I have been brought very low;<br>save me from my pursuers,<br>for they are too strong for me.
Free me from prison,<br>that I may praise Your name.<br>The righteous <sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>shall glory in me<sup class="endFootnote">-b</sup><br>for Your gracious dealings with me.

Chapter 143

A psalm of David.<br><br>O L<small>ORD</small>, hear my prayer;<br>give ear to my plea, as You are faithful;<br>answer me, as You are beneficent.
Do not enter into judgment with Your servant,<br>for before You no creature is in the right.<br>
My foe hounded me;<br>he crushed me to the ground;<br>he made me dwell in darkness<br>like those long dead.
My spirit failed within me;<br>my mind was numbed with horror.
Then I thought of the days of old;<br>I rehearsed all Your deeds,<br>recounted the work of Your hands.
I stretched out my hands to You,<br>longing for You like thirsty earth. <i>Selah</i>.<br>
Answer me quickly, O L<small>ORD</small>;<br>my spirit can endure no more.<br>Do not hide Your face from me,<br>or I shall become like those who descend into the Pit.
Let me learn of Your faithfulness by daybreak,<br>for in You I trust;<br>let me know the road I must take,<br>for on You I have set my hope.
Save me from my foes, O L<small>ORD</small>;<br><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i>to You I look for cover.<sup class="endFootnote">-a</sup>
Teach me to do Your will,<br>for You are my God.<br>Let Your gracious spirit lead me<br>on level ground.
For the sake of Your name, O L<small>ORD</small>, preserve me;<br>as You are beneficent, free me from distress.
As You are faithful, put an end to my foes;<br>destroy all my mortal enemies,<br>for I am Your servant.

Chapter 144

Of David.<br><br>Blessed is the L<small>ORD</small>, my rock,<br>who trains my hands for battle,<br>my fingers for warfare;
my faithful one, my fortress,<br>my haven and my deliverer,<br>my shield, in whom I take shelter,<br>who makes peoples<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">So Targum, Saadia; others “my people.”</i> subject to me.
O L<small>ORD</small>, what is man that You should care about him,<br>mortal man, that You should think of him?
Man is like a breath;<br>his days are like a passing shadow.
O L<small>ORD</small>, bend Your sky and come down;<br>touch the mountains and they will smoke.
Make lightning flash and scatter them;<br>shoot Your arrows and rout them.
Reach Your hand down from on high;<br>rescue me, save me from the mighty waters,<br>from the hands of foreigners,
whose mouths speak lies,<br>and whose oaths<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">With Rashi; lit. “right hand.”</i> are false.<br>
O God, I will sing You a new song,<br>sing a hymn to You with a ten-stringed harp,
to You who give victory to kings,<br>who rescue His servant David from the deadly sword.
Rescue me, save me from the hands of foreigners,<br>whose mouths speak lies,<br>and whose oaths<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote">With Rashi; lit. “right hand.”</i> are false.<br>
<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of several phrases in vv. 12–14 is uncertain.</i>For our sons are like saplings,<br>well-tended in their youth;<br>our daughters are like cornerstones<br>trimmed to give shape to a palace.
Our storehouses are full,<br>supplying produce of all kinds;<br>our flocks number thousands,<br>even myriads, in our fields;
our cattle are well cared for.<br>There is no breaching and no sortie,<br>and no wailing in our streets.<br>
Happy the people who have it so;<br>happy the people whose God is the L<small>ORD</small>.

The L<small>ORD</small> rebuilds Jerusalem;<br>He gathers in the exiles of Israel.

Sing to the L<small>ORD</small> a song of praise,<br>chant a hymn with a lyre to our God,
who covers the heavens with clouds,<br>provides rain for the earth,<br>makes mountains put forth grass;
who gives the beasts their food,<br>to the raven’s brood what they cry for.
He does not prize the strength of horses,<br>nor value the fleetness<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">Lit. “thighs.”</i> of men;
but the L<small>ORD</small> values those who fear Him,<br>those who depend on His faithful care.<br>
O Jerusalem, glorify the L<small>ORD</small>;<br>praise your God, O Zion!
For He made the bars of your gates strong,<br>and blessed your children within you.
He endows your realm with well-being,<br>and satisfies you with choice wheat.<br>
He sends forth His word to the earth;<br>His command runs swiftly.
He lays down snow like fleece,<br>scatters frost like ashes.
He tosses down hail like crumbs—<br>who can endure His icy cold?
He issues a command—it melts them;<br>He breathes—the waters flow.
He issued His commands to Jacob,<br>His statutes and rules to Israel.
He did not do so for any other nation;<br>of such rules they know nothing.<br>Hallelujah.

executing the doom decreed against them.<br>This is the glory of all His faithful.<br>Hallelujah.
