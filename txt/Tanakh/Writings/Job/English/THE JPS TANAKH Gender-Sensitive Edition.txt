Job



Chapter 1

There was a man in the land of Uz named Job. That man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil. 
Seven sons and three daughters were born to him; 
his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred jennies, and a very large household. That man was wealthier than anyone in the East.
It was the custom of his sons to hold feasts, each on his set day in his own home. They would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. 
When a round of feast days was over, Job would send word to them to sanctify themselves, and, rising early in the morning, he would make burnt offerings, one for each of them; for Job thought, “Perhaps my children have sinned and blasphemed God in their thoughts.” This is what Job always used to do.
One day the divine beings presented themselves before G<small>OD</small>, and the Adversary<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote"><b>the Adversary </b>Heb. <i>hassaṭan</i>.</i> came along with them. 
G<small>OD</small> said to the Adversary, “Where have you been?” The Adversary answered G<small>OD</small>, “I have been roaming all over the earth.” 
G<small>OD</small> said to the Adversary, “Have you noticed My servant Job? There is no one like him on earth, a blameless and upright man who fears God and shuns evil!” 
The Adversary answered G<small>OD</small>, “Does Job not have good reason to fear God? 
Why, it is You who have fenced him round, him and his household and all that he has. You have blessed his efforts so that his possessions spread out in the land. 
But lay Your hand upon all that he has and he will surely blaspheme You to Your face.” 
G<small>OD</small> replied to the Adversary, “See, all that he has is in your power; only do not lay a hand on him.” The Adversary departed from G<small>OD</small>’s presence.
One day, as his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother, 
a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the jennies were grazing alongside them 
when Sabeans attacked them and carried them off, and put the attendants to the sword; I alone have escaped to tell you.” 
This one was still speaking when another came and said, “God’s fire fell from heaven, took hold of the sheep and the attendants, and burned them up; I alone have escaped to tell you.” 
This one was still speaking when another came and said, “A Chaldean formation of three columns made a raid on the camels and carried them off and put the attendants to the sword; I alone have escaped to tell you.” 
This one was still speaking when another came and said, “Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother 
when suddenly a mighty wind came from the wilderness. It struck the four corners of the house so that it collapsed upon the young people and they died; I alone have escaped to tell you.”
Then Job arose, tore his robe, cut off his hair, and threw himself on the ground and worshiped. 
He said, “Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return there; G<small>OD</small> has given, and G<small>OD</small> has taken away; blessed be G<small>OD</small>’s name.”
For all that, Job did not sin nor did he cast reproach on God.

Chapter 2

One day the divine beings presented themselves before G<small>OD</small>. The Adversary came along with them to present himself before G<small>OD</small>. 
G<small>OD</small> said to the Adversary, “Where have you been?” The Adversary answered G<small>OD</small>, “I have been roaming all over the earth.” 
G<small>OD</small> said to the Adversary, “Have you noticed My servant Job? There is no one like him on earth, a blameless and upright man who fears God and shuns evil. He still keeps his integrity; so you have incited Me against him to destroy him for no good reason.” 
The Adversary answered G<small>OD</small>, “Skin for skin<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Skin for skin </b>Apparently a proverb whose meaning is uncertain.</i>—all that the man has he will give up for his life. 
But lay a hand on his bones and his flesh, and he will surely blaspheme You to Your face.” 
So G<small>OD</small> said to the Adversary, “See, he is in your power; only spare his life.” 
The Adversary departed from G<small>OD</small>’s presence and inflicted a severe inflammation on Job from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. 
He took a potsherd to scratch himself as he sat in ashes. 
His wife said to him, “You still keep your integrity! Blaspheme God and die!” 
But he said to her, “You talk as any shameless woman might talk! Should we accept only good from God and not accept evil?” For all that, Job said nothing sinful.
When Job’s three friends heard about all these calamities that had befallen him, each came from his home—Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They met together to go and console and comfort him. 
When they saw him from a distance, they could not recognize him, and they broke into loud weeping; each one tore his robe and threw dust into the air onto his head. 
They sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights. None spoke a word to him for they saw how very great was his suffering.

Chapter 3

<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote">There are many difficulties in the poetry of Job, making the interpretation of words, verses, and even chapters uncertain.

Job spoke up and said:

<span class="poetry indentAll">I had no repose, no quiet, no rest,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And trouble came.</span>

Chapter 4

Then Eliphaz the Temanite said in reply:
<span class="poetry indentAll">If one ventures a word with you, will it be too much?</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">But who can hold back his words?</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">See, you have encouraged many;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">You have strengthened failing hands.</span>

<span class="poetry indentAll">But now that it overtakes you, it is too much;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">It reaches you, and you are unnerved.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Is not your piety your confidence,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Your integrity your hope?</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Think now, what innocent ever perished?</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Where have the upright been destroyed?</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">As I have seen, those who plow evil</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And sow mischief reap them.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">They perish by a blast from the divine,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Are gone at the breath of God’s nostrils.</span>

<span class="poetry indentAll">The lion perishes for lack of prey,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And its whelps are scattered.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A word came to me in stealth;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">My ear caught a whisper of it.</span>

<span class="poetry indentAll">It halted; its appearance was strange to me;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">A form loomed before my eyes;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">I heard a murmur, a voice,</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">“Can a mortal be acquitted by God?</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Can a man be cleared by his Maker?</span>

Chapter 32

These three men ceased replying to Job, for he considered himself right. 
Then Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was angry—angry at Job because he thought himself right against God. 
He was angry as well at his three friends, because they found no reply, but merely condemned Job. 
Elihu waited out Job’s speech, for they were all older than he. 
But when Elihu saw that the three men had nothing to reply, he was angry.
Then Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite said in reply:<br><span class="poetry indentAll">I have but few years, while you are old;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Therefore I was too awestruck and fearful</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">To hold forth among you.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">I thought, “Let age speak;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Let advanced years declare wise things.”</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">But truly it is the spirit in mortals,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">The breath of Shaddai, that gives them understanding.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">It is not the aged who are wise,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">The elders, who understand how to judge.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Therefore I say, “Listen to me;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">I too would hold forth.”</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Here I have waited out your speeches,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">I have given ear to your insights,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">While you probed the issues;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">But as I attended to you,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">I saw that none of you could argue with Job,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Or offer replies to his statements.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">I fear you will say, “We have found the wise course;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">God will defeat him, not other people.”</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">He did not set out his case against me,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Nor shall I use your reasons to reply to him.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">They have been broken and can no longer reply;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Words fail them.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">I have waited till they stopped speaking,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Till they ended and no longer replied.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Now I also would have my say;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">I too would like to hold forth,</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">For I am full of words;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">The wind in my belly presses me.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">My belly is like wine not yet opened,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Like jugs of new wine ready to burst.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Let me speak, then, and get relief;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Let me open my lips and reply.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">I would not show regard for anybody,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Or temper my speech for the sake of any mortal;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">For I do not know how to temper my speech—</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">My Maker would soon carry me off!</span>

Chapter 33

<span class="poetry indentAll">But now, Job, listen to my words,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Give ear to all that I say.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Now I open my lips;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">My tongue forms words in my mouth.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">My words bespeak the uprightness of my heart;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">My lips utter insight honestly.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The spirit of God formed me;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">The breath of Shaddai sustains me.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">If you can, answer me;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Argue against me, take your stand.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">You and I are the same before God;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">I too was nipped from clay.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">You are not overwhelmed by fear of me;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">My pressure does not weigh heavily on you.</span>

<span class="poetry indentAll">Why do you level the complaint</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">That there is no reply to anyone’s charges?</span>

<span class="poetry indentAll">Then everyone’s understanding is opened,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And God’s signature is left by disciplining them—</span>

Elihu said in reply:

<span class="poetry indentAll">Therefore, men of understanding, listen to me;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Wickedness be far from God,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Wrongdoing, from Shaddai!</span>

<span class="poetry indentAll">Would one who hates justice govern?</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Would you condemn the Just Mighty One?</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Would you call a king a scoundrel,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Nobles, wicked?</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">[God] is not partial to princes;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">The honorable are not preferred to the wretched;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">For all of them are the work of God’s hands.</span>

<span class="poetry indentAll">Thus the cry of the poor is admitted;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">The cry of the needy is heard.</span>

<span class="poetry indentAll">Should [God] requite as you see fit?</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">But you have acted with disdain!</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">You must decide, not I;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Speak what you know.</span>

Chapter 35

Elihu said in reply:
<span class="poetry indentAll">Do you think it just</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">To say, “I am right against God”?</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">If you ask how it benefits you,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">“What have I gained from not sinning?”</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">I shall give you a reply,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">You, along with your friends.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Behold the heavens and see;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Look at the skies high above you.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">If you sin, what do you do to [God]?</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">If your transgressions are many,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">How do you affect [God]?</span>

<span class="poetry indentAll">Your wickedness affects parties like yourself;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Your righteousness, other people.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Because of contention the oppressed cry out;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">They shout because of the power of the great.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">But none says, “Where is my God, my Maker,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Who gives strength in the night;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Who gives us more knowledge than the beasts of the earth,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?”</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Then they cry out, but they are not answered</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Because of the arrogance of evildoers.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Surely it is false that God does not listen,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">That Shaddai does not take note of it.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Though you say, “You do not take note of it,”</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">The case is before [God];</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">So you must wait.</span>

<span class="poetry indentAll">Hence Job mouths empty words,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And piles up words without knowledge.</span>

Chapter 36

Then Elihu spoke once more.
<span class="poetry indentAll">Wait a little and let me hold forth;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">There is still more to say for God.</span>

<span class="poetry indentAll">Who is this who obscures counsel without knowledge?</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Indeed, I spoke without understanding</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Of things beyond me, which I did not know.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Hear now, and I will speak;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">I will ask, and You will inform me.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">I had heard You with my ears,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">But now I see You with my eyes;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Therefore, I recant and relent,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Being but dust and ashes.</span>
After G<small>OD</small> had spoken these words to Job, G<small>OD</small> said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “I am incensed at you and your two friends, for you have not spoken the truth about Me as did My servant Job. 
Now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to My servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. And let Job, My servant, pray for you; for to him I will show favor and not treat you vilely, since you have not spoken the truth about Me as did My servant Job.” 
Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as G<small>OD</small> had told them, and G<small>OD</small> showed favor to Job. 
G<small>OD</small> restored Job’s fortunes when he prayed on behalf of his friends, and G<small>OD</small> gave Job twice what he had before.
All his brothers and sisters and all his former friends came to him and had a meal with him in his house. They consoled and comforted him for all the misfortune that G<small>OD</small> had brought upon him. Each gave him one <i>kesitah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote"><b><i>kesitah</i> </b>A unit of unknown value.</i> and each one gold ring. 
Thus G<small>OD</small> blessed the latter years of Job’s life more than the former. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and one thousand jennies. 
He also had seven sons and three daughters. 
The first he named Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch. 
Nowhere in the land were women as beautiful as Job’s daughters to be found. Their father gave them estates together with their brothers. 
Afterward, Job lived one hundred and forty years to see four generations of children and grandchildren. 
So Job died old and contented.
