Lamentations



Chapter 1

1 How she sits alone, the city which was once great! she became like a widow, though was great amongst the nations; she ruled amongst the countries and became taxed...
2 She shall surely cry at night! Her tears upon her cheeks, she has no one to comfort her from amongst her loved ones; all her friends betrayed her,  they became her enemies.  איבים&lt;-&gt;אוהבים... 
3 Yehuda was exiled in a state of suffering and much work, she sat amongst the nation and couldn't find rest; all her pursuers caught her between the oppressors... 
 The paths of Zion are mourning from the absence of holiday-comers, all her city-square-gates  are desolate, her priests are groaning; her young women aggrieved, and as for her it is bitter... 
Her foes have become the top, heads enemies are at ease, because God grieves her for all her sins; her young children went in captivity before enemy... 
Gone from the daughter of Zion all her splendor; all of her princes have become like gazelles which have not found pasture, they walked without strength before her pursuer...
Jerusalem remembers in the days of her suffering and restlessness all of her treasures that she had before; in her nation falling in the hands of an oppressor and no one helps her, her enemies saw her, they  laughed at her being shut down.... parallels Hoshea 2:13
Jerusalem has sinned, therefor she has become a wanderer; all those who honored her cheapen her for they have seen her nakedness ( vulnerability), also she groaned and she turns back.
