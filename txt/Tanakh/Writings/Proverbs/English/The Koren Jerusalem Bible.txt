Proverbs



Chapter 1

The proverbs of Shelomo the son of David, king of Yisra᾽el;
to know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;
to receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;
to give prudence to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.
A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain to wise counsels:
to understand a proverb, and a figure; the words of the wise, and their riddles.
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.
My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and do not forsake the Tora of thy mother:
for they shall be a graceful garland for thy head, and chains about thy neck.
My son, if sinners entice thee, do not consent.
If they say, Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us lurk for the innocent without cause:
let us swallow them up alive like She᾽ol; and whole, like those who go down into the pit:
we shall find all precious goods; we shall fill our houses with spoil:
throw in thy lot among us; we shall all have one purse:
my son, do not walk in the way with them; restrain thy foot from their path:
for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.
For no heed is taken of the net which is spread in the sight of any bird.
And they lie in wait for their blood; they lurk for their lives.
So are the ways of everyone who is greedy of gain; it takes away the life of its owner.
Wisdom cries aloud in the street; she utters her voice in the squares:
she cries in the chief place of concourse, at the entrances of the gates: in the city she utters her words, saying,
How long, you simple ones, will you love being simple? and how long, O scorners, will you delight in scoffing, and fools hate knowledge?
turn at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit to you, I will make known to you my words.
Because I have called, and you refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;
but you have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:
I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear comes upon you;
when your fear comes like a storm, and your calamity comes like a tempest; when distress and anguish come upon you.
Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they will not find me:
for they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord:
they would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.
Therefore they shall eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.
For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the erring of fools shall destroy them.
But he who listens to me shall dwell safely, and shall be at ease without fear of evil.

Chapter 2

My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and treasure up my commandments with thee;
so that thou incline thy ear to wisdom, and apply thy heart to understanding indeed,
if thou criest after wisdom, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;
if thou seekest her like silver, and searchest for her as for hidden treasures;
then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God.
For the Lord gives wisdom: out of his mouth come knowledge and understanding.
He lays up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a shield to those who walk uprightly,
to keep the paths of justice; and he preserves the way of his pious ones.
Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and justice and equity, every good path:
for wisdom shall enter thy heart, and knowledge be pleasant to thy soul;
discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:
to deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man who speaks perverse things;
who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;
who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the perverseness of the wicked;
whose ways are crooked, and who are underhand in their paths:
to deliver thee from the strange woman, from the alien woman who speaks so smoothly;
who forsakes the friend of her youth, and forgets the covenant of her God.
For her house inclines to death, and her paths to the dead.
None that go to her return, nor do they regain the paths of life:
that thou mayst walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.
For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the innocent shall remain in it.
But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the faithless shall be rooted out of it.

Chapter 3

My son, forget not my Tora; but let thy heart keep my commandments:
For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.
Let not loyal love and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thy heart:
so shalt thou find grace and good understanding in the sight of God and man.
Trust in the Lord with all thy heart; and do not lean upon thy own understanding.
In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
Be not wise in thy own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil.
It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.
Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thy increase:
so shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy vats shall burst with new wine.
My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord; nor be weary of his correction:
for the Lord reproves him whom he loves: even as a father the son in whom he delights.
Happy is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gets understanding.
For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and its gain than fine gold.
She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared to her.
Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand are riches and honour.
Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.
She is a tree of life to those who lay hold on her: and happy are those who hold her fast.
The Lord by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he estab­lished the heavens.
By his knowledge the depths were broken up, and the clouds drop down dew.
My son, let them not depart from thy eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:
so shall they be life to thy soul, and grace to thy neck.
Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.
When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: indeed, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
Be not afraid of sudden fear, nor of the ruin of the wicked, when it comes.
For the Lord shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being caught.
Withhold not good from those to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thy hand to do it.
Say not to thy neighbour, Go, and come back, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.
Do not devise evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwells securely by thee.
Do not strive with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.
Do not envy the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.
For the underhand man is abomination to the Lord: and he shares his counsel with the righteous.
The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked: but he blesses the habitation of the just.
Surely he scorns the scorners: but he gives grace to the humble.
The wise shall inherit honour: but fools shall get shame.

Chapter 4

Hear, you children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.
For I give you good doctrine, forsake not my Tora.
For I was my father’s son, tender and the only one in the sight of my mother.
He taught me also, and said to me, Let thy heart hold fast to my words: keep my commandments, and live.
Get wisdom, get understanding: do not forget it; nor decline from the words of my mouth.
Do not forsake her, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.
The beginning of wisdom is, Get wisdom: therefore use all your means to acquire understanding.
Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she will bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.
She shall give to thy head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she bestow on thee.
Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.
I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in paths of rectitude.
When thou goest, thy steps shall not be confined; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.
Do not enter into the path of the wicked, and do not go in the way of evil men.
Avoid it, do not pass by it, turn from it, and pass on.
For they sleep not, unless they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.
For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
But the path of just men is like the gleam of sunlight, that shines ever more brightly until the height of noonday.
The way of the wicked is like darkness: they know not at what they stumble.
My son, attend to my words; incline thy ear to my sayings.
Let them not depart from thy eyes; keep them in the midst of thy heart.
For they are life to those who find them, and health to all their flesh.
Keep thy heart with the greatest vigilance; for out of it are the issues of life.
Put away from thee a dissembling mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.
Let thy eyes look right on, and let thy eyelids look straight before thee.
Make even the path of thy foot, and let all thy ways be firm.
Do not turn to the right hand or to the left: remove thy foot from evil.

Chapter 5

My son, attend to my wisdom, and bend thy ear to my understanding:
that thou mayst preserve discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.
For the lips of a strange woman drip honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil:
but her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two edged sword.
Her feet go down to death: her steps take hold of She᾽ol.
She is far from measuring her way of life; her paths wander, and she is ignorant.
Hear me now therefore, O children, and do not depart from the words of my mouth.
Remove thy way far from her, and do not come near the door of her house:
lest thou give thy vigour to others, and thy years to the cruel one:
lest strangers be filled with thy strength; and thy labours go to the house of a stranger:
and thou moan when thy end comes, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
and thou say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof!
And I have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor bent my ear to those who instructed me!
I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.
Drink waters out of thy own cistern, and running waters out of thy own well.
So will thy spring be dispersed abroad, and streams of water will flow in the broad places.
Let them be only thy own, and not strangers’ with thee.
Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.
A loving hind and a pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.
And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of an alien?
For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he ponders all his goings.
His own iniquities shall trap the wicked man, and he shall be caught fast in the cords of his sins.
He shall die for want of instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.

Chapter 6

My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast struck thy palms for a stranger,
if thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, caught with the sayings of thy mouth:
do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy neighbour; go, abase thyself, and importune thy neighbour.
Give no sleep to thy eyes, nor slumber to thy eyelids.
Deliver thyself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, and like a bird from the hand of the fowler.
Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:
which having no guide, overseer, or ruler;
provides her bread in the summer, and gathers her food in the harvest.
How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
so shall thy poverty come like a marauder, and thy want like an armed man.
A base person, a wicked man, is one that walks with a crowed mouth,
that winks with his eyes, that taps with his feet, that points with his fingers;
perverseness is in his heart; he devises mischief continually; he sows discord.
Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.
There are six things which the Lord hates, and seven which are an abomination to him:
a proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
a heart that devises wicked thoughts, feet that are swift in running to mischief,
a false witness that breathes out lies, and one that sows discord among brethren.
My son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the Tora of thy mother:
bind them continually upon thy heart, and tie them about thy neck.
When thou walkest, it shall lead thee; when thou liest down, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
For the commandment is a lamp; and Tora is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:
to keep thee from the evil woman, from the smoothness of the tongue of an alien.
Lust not after her beauty in thy heart; nor let her take thee with her eyelids.
For by means of a harlot a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.
Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
Can one walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?
So he that goes in to his neighbour’s wife; whoever touches her shall not go unpunished.
Do not men despise a thief, even if he steals to satisfy his soul when he is hungry?
And if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.
He who commits adultery with a woman lacks understanding: he who does that destroys his soul.
A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
For jealousy is the rage of a man: and he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
He will not regard any ransom; nor will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.

Chapter 7

My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.
Keep my commandments, and live; and my Tora as the apple of thy eye.
Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the tablet of thy heart.
Say to wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:
that they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the alien woman who makes smooth her words.
For at the window of my house I looked out through my lattice,
and beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,
passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,
in the twilight, in the evening, in the blackness of a dark night:
and, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of a harlot, and wily of heart.
(She is noisy and ungovernable: her feet do not remain in her house:
now is she outside, now in the streets, and she lies in wait at every corner.)
So she caught hold of him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said to him,
I have had to sacrifice peace offerings; this day have I paid my vows.
So I came out to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.
I have decked my bed with coverings, with tapestry of Miżrian yarn.
I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us delight ourselves with loves.
For my husband is not at home, he is gone a long journey:
he has taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the full moon.
With her much fair speech she causes him to yield, with the smoothness of her lips she seduces him.
He goes after her at once, as an ox goes to the slaughter, and as a man in chains to the chastisement of a fool;
till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hastens to the snare, and knows not that it is for his life.
Hearken to me now therefore, O you children, and attend to the words of my mouth.
Let not thy heart decline to her ways, do not go astray in her paths.
For she has cast down many wounded: and many strong men have been slain by her.
Her house is the way to She᾽ol, going down to the chambers of death.

Chapter 8

Does not wisdom call? and understanding put forth her voice?
She stands at the top of high places by the way, where the paths meet.
She cries out at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in of the doors.
To you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.
O you simple, understand prudence: and, you fools, be of an understanding heart.
Hear; for I will speak excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be rectitude.
For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing crooked or perverse in them.
They are all plain to him that understands, and right to those who find knowledge.
Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.
For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.
I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, and find knowledge and discretion.
The fear of the Lord is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the sly mouth I hate.
Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.
By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.
By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.
I love those who love me; and those who seek me early shall find me.
Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.
My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my produce than choice silver.
I walk in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of justice:
That I may cause those who love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.
The Lord created me as the beginning of his way, the first of his works of old.
I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, before ever the earth was.
When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.
Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:
while as yet he had not made the earth, or the fields, or the highest part of the dust of the world.
When he established the heavens, I was there: when he drew a circle over the surface of the deep:
when he established the clouds above: when the fountains of the deep became strong:
when he gave to the sea its decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:
then I was by him, as a nurseling: and I was daily his delight, playing always before him;
playing with the universe, his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.
Now therefore hearken to me, O you children: for happy are they who keep my ways.
Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.
Happy is the man who hearkens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.
For whoever finds me finds life, and obtains favour of the Lord.
But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul: all they who hate me love death.

Chapter 9

Wisdom has built her house, she has hewn out her seven pillars:
she has killed her beasts; she has mingled her wine; she has also furnished her table.
She has sent forth her maidens: she calls upon the highest places of the city, Whoever is simple, let him turn in here:
as for him that lacks understanding, she says to him,
Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.
Forsake foolishness, and live; and go in the way of understanding.
He who corrects a scorner brings shame on himself: and he who rebukes a wicked man brings on himself his blemish.
Do not reprove a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.
Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of holy matters is understanding.
For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.
If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself: and if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.
The woman Folly is clamorous: she is simple, and knows nothing.
For she sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city.
Calling out to passers by who are going straight on their ways:
Whoever is simple, let him turn in here: and as for him that lacks understanding, she says to him,
Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.
But he knows not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of She᾽ol.

Chapter 10

The proverbs of Shelomo. A wise son makes a glad father: but a foolish son is the grief of his mother.
Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivers from death.
The Lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he thrusts away the desire of the wicked.
A slack hand causes poverty: but the hand of the diligent makes rich.
He that gathers in summer is a wise son: but a son that sleeps in harvest brings shame.
Blessings are upon the head of the just: but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.
The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.

The mouth of a righteous man is a fountain of life: but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.
Hatred stirs up strifes: but love covers all sins.
In the lips of him that has understanding wisdom is found: but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.
Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the fool brings ruin near.
The rich man’s wealth is his strong city: the ruin of the poor is their poverty.
The wage of the righteous brings life: the gain of the wicked leads to sin.
He that keeps instruction is in the way of life: but he that refuses reproof leads astray.
He who hides hatred uses lying lips, and he that utters a slander, is a fool.
In the multitude of words sin is not lacking: but he who restrains his lips is wise.
The tongue of the just is like choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth.
The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom.
The blessing of the Lord, it makes rich, and he adds no sorrow with it.
It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: and likewise is it to a man of understanding to practise wisdom.
What the wicked dreads shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.
When the storm wind passes, the wicked is no more: but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.
As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to those who send him.
The fear of the Lord prolongs days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.
The hope of the righteous is gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.
The way of the Lord is a stronghold to the upright, but destruction to the workers of iniquity.

The mouth of the just brings forth wisdom: but the perverse tongue shall be cut off.
The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked is crookedness.

The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked comes in his stead.
A hypocrite destroys his neighbour with his mouth: but the just shall be delivered through knowledge.
When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices: but when the wicked perish, there is jubilation.
By the blessing of the upright a city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
He that is void of wisdom despises his neighbour: but a man of understanding holds his peace.
A talebearer reveals secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit conceals the matter.
Where there is no counsel, a people falls: but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.
He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: but he that hates suretyship is safe.
A woman of charm obtains honour: and powerful men obtain wealth.
The merciful man does good to his own soul: but he that is cruel troubles his own flesh.
The wicked man earns wages of deceit: but he that sows righteousness has a sure reward.
He that is firm in righteousness achieves life; but he that pursues evil comes to his own death.
They that are of a crooked heart are an abomination to the Lord: but such as are upright in their way are his delight.
They who join hands for wicked ends shall not go unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.
Like a jewel of gold in a swine’s snout, so is a fair woman without discretion.
The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation of the wicked is wrath.
There is one who gives freely, and yet increases, another spares unjustly, but comes to want.
The liberal soul shall be made rich: and he who waters shall be nourished also himself.
He who holds back corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing shall be upon the head of him who sells freely.
He who diligently seeks good procures favour: but he who seeks mischief, it shall come to him.
He who trusts in his riches shall fall: but the righteous shall flourish like foliage.
He who troubles his own house shall inherit wind: and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.
The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that wins souls is wise.
Behold, the just man shall be recompensed on earth: how much more the wicked and the sinner!

Chapter 12

Deceit is in the heart of those who imagine evil: but the counsellors of peace have joy.
No evil shall happen to the just: but the wicked are filled with mischief.
Lying lips are abomination to the Lord: but they who deal truly are his delight.
A prudent man conceals knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaims his foolishness.

In the way of righteousness is life; and in its path there is no death.

Chapter 13

A wise son hears his father’s instruction: but a scorner does not accept rebuke.

The wisdom of women builds her house: but Folly plucks it down with her hands.
He who walks in his uprightness fears the Lord: but he who is perverse in his ways despises him.
In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them.

As the doors turns on its hinges, so does the slothful upon his bed.
The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; it grieves him to bring it back to his mouth.
The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven men that can give sensible reasons.
He who passes by, and meddles with a strife not his own, is like one who takes a dog by the ears.
As a madman who throws firebrands, arrows, and death,
so is a man who tricks his neighbour, and says, But I was only joking!
Where no wood is, there the fire goes out: so where there is no talebearer, strife ceases.
As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife.
The words of a talebearer are like dainties, and they go down into the innermost parts of the body.
Burning lips and a wicked heart are like an earthenware dish covered with silver dross.
He who hates dissembles with his lips, and lays up deceit within him;
when he speaks fair, do not believe him: for there are seven abominations in his heart.
He whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be revealed before the whole congregation.
The one who digs a pit shall fall into it: and if one rolls a stone, it will return upon him.
A lying tongue hates its victims; and a flattering mouth works ruin.

Chapter 27

Do not boast thyself of tomorrow; for thou knowst not what today may bring forth.
Let another man praise thee, and not thy own mouth; a stranger, and not thy own lips.
A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool’s wrath is heavier than both of them.
Wrath is cruel, and anger is overwhelming; but who is able to stand before envy?
Open rebuke is better than hidden love.
Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are profuse.
The full soul loathes a honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.
As a bird that wanders from her nest, so is a man who wanders from his place.
Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so does the sweetness of a man’s friend by hearty counsel.
Do not forsake thy own friend, and thy father’s friend; nor go into thy brother’s house in the day of thy calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off.
My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him who taunts me.
A prudent man sees the evil, and hides himself; but simpletons pass on, and are punished.
Take his garment when he is surety for a stranger, and take his pledge on behalf of an alien woman.
He that blesses his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.
A continual dripping on a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.
Whoever would hide her hides the wind, like the ointment of his right hand, which betrays itself.
Iron sharpens iron; so one man sharpens another.
He who guards the fig tree shall eat its fruit: so he who waits on his master shall be honoured.
As in water face answers to face, so the heart of man to man.
She᾽ol and Avaddon are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.
The refining pot is for silver, arid the furnace for gold; and a man is tried according to his praise.
Though thou shouldst grind a fool in a mortar among crushed grain with a pestle, yet will his foolishness not depart from him.
Be diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds.
For riches are not forever: and does the crown endure to all generations?
When the grass sprouts forth, and the young grass appears, and the herbs on the mountains are gathered in;
lambs shall provide thy clothing, and goats the price of a field:
and thou shalt have goats’ milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for the maintenance of thy maidens.

Chapter 28

The wicked flee when no man pursues: but the righteous are bold as a lion.
When the land is sinful, its princes are numerous: but when there is a judicious man, knowing what is right, he shall endure.
A poor man that oppresses the weak is like a sweeping rain which leaves no food.
They who forsake Tora praise the wicked: but such as keep Tora contend with them.
Evil men understand not justice: but they who seek the Lord understand all things.
Better is the poor who walks in his uprightness, than he who deals perversely in his ways, though he be rich.
A wise son keeps Tora, but he that is a companion of riotous men shames his father.
He who by usury and unjust gain increases his substance, gathers it for him who will graciously regard the poor.
He who turns away his ear from hearing Tora, even his prayer is abomination.
He who causes the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the innocent shall inherit good.
The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that has understanding searches him out.
When righteous men rejoice, there is great glory: but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.
He that covers up his sins shall not prosper: but whoever confesses and forsakes them shall have mercy.
Happy is the man who fears always: but he who hardens his heart shall fall into mischief.
As a roaring lion, and a hungry bear, so is a wicked ruler over the poor people.
The prince who lacks understanding is also a great oppressor: but the one who hates covetousness shall prolong his days.
A man that is burdened with the blood of any person shall flee to the pit; let none support him.
He who walks uprightly shall be saved: but he who takes crooked paths shall fall suddenly.
He who tills his land shall have plenty of bread: but he who follows after vain persons shall have poverty enough.
A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he who makes haste to be rich shall not go unpunished.
To have respect of persons is not good: for a man will transgress for a piece of bread.
The man of evil eye is eager for wealth: he does not know that want will come upon him.
He who rebukes a man shall find more favour afterwards than he who flatters with the tongue.
He who robs his father or his mother, and says, It is no transgression; he is companion of a destroyer.
He that is of a greedy heart stirs up strife: but he that puts his trust in the Lord shall be made rich.
He who trusts in his own heart is a fool: but he who walks wisely, shall escape.
He who gives to the poor shall not lack: but he who hides his eyes shall have many a curse.
When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.

Chapter 29

He, that being often reproved hardens his neck, shall suddenly be broken, beyond healing.
When the righteous are on the increase, the people rejoice: but when the wicked man bears rule, the people mourn.
He who loves wisdom gladdens his father: but he who keeps company with harlots wastes his substance.
The king by justice establishes the land: but he who exacts gifts overthrows it.
A man who flatters his neighbour spreads a net for his feet.
In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the righteous man sings and rejoices.
The righteous man apprehends the cause of the poor: but the wicked man cannot grasp that knowledge.
Scornful men stir up a city into strife: but wise men turn away wrath.
If a wise man contends with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest.
The bloodthirsty hate the innocent: but the just seek his good.
A fool vents all his anger: but a wise man keeping it in subdues it.
If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked.
The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the Lord gives light to the eyes of both.
The king who faithfully judges the poor, his throne shall be established for ever.
The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself brings shame to his mother.
When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increases: both the righteous shall witness their fall.
Correct thy son, and he will give thee rest; and he will give delight to thy soul.
Where there is no vision, the people become unruly: but happy is he who keeps Tora.
A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understands he will not answer.
Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope for a fool than for him.
He who pampers his servant from a child shall have him become his master at last.
An angry man stirs up strife, and a furious man abounds in transgression.
A man’s pride shall bring him low: but the humble in spirit shall attain honour.
Whoever is partner with a thief is his own enemy: he hears the adjuration of witnesses, but discloses nothing.
The fear of man brings a snare: but he who puts his trust in the Lord shall be protected.
Many seek the ruler’s favour; but a man’s judgment comes from the Lord.
An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked.

Chapter 30

The words of Agur son of Yaqe, the burden. Thus says the man, I am weary, O God, I am weary, O God, and I am consumed:
for I am more brutish than a man, and have not the understanding of a man.
I have not learned wisdom; that I should desire to have the knowledge of the holy.
Who has ascended up into heaven, and come down again? who has gathered the wind in his fists? who has bound the waters in a garment? who has established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son’s name, if thou canst tell?
Every word of God is proven: he is a shield to those who put their trust in him.
Add not to his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.
Two things have I asked of thee; do not deny me them before I die:
remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with my allotted portion:
lest I become sated, and deny thee, and say, Who is the Lord? or lest I be poor, and steal, and violate the name of my God.
Accuse not a servant to his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.
There is a generation that curse their father, and do not bless their mother.
There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet are not washed from their filthiness.
There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.
There is a generation, whose teeth are like swords, and their jaw teeth like knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.
The leech has two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied; four that never say, It is enough.
She᾽ol; and the barren womb; the earth that is never sated with water; and the fire that never says, It is enough.
The eye that mocks at his father, and scorns to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young vultures shall eat it.
There are three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:
the way of the vultures in the air; the way of a snake upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a young woman.
Likewise the way of an adulterous woman; she eats, and wipes her mouth, and says, I have done nothing wrong.
For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four it cannot bear:
for a slave when he becomes king; and a fool when he is filled with food;
for an unloved woman when she is married; and a handmaid that is heir to her mistress.
There are four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise:
the ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their bread in the summer;
the badgers are but a feeble folk, yet they make their houses in the rocks;
the locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;
The lizard clambers up with her hands, and she is in king’s palaces.
There are three things which are stately in their tread; four are comely in their stride:
a lion which is strongest among beasts, and does not turn away for anyone;
a greyhound; a he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up.
If thou hast done foolishly in lifting thyself up, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thy hand upon thy mouth.
Surely the wringing of milk brings forth curd, and the wringing of the nose brings forth blood: so the forcing of wrath brings forth strife.

Chapter 31

The words of king Lemu᾽el, the prophecy, that his mother taught him.
What, my son? and what, son of my womb? and what, son of my vows?
Give not thy strength to women, nor thy ways to those who destroy kings.
It is not for kings, O Lemu᾽el, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes to say, Where is strong drink?
Lest he drink, and forget the decree, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.
Give strong drink to him that is ready to perish, and wine to those of heavy hearts.
Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.
Open thy mouth for the dumb, in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.
Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.
Who can find a woman of worth? for her price is far above rubies.
The heart of her husband safely trusts in her, and he shall have no lack of gain.
She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.
She seeks wool, and flax, and works willingly with her hands.
She is like the merchant ships; she brings her food from afar.
She rises also while it is yet night, and gives food to her household, and a portion to her maidens.
She considers a field, and buys it: with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.
She girds her loins with strength, and she makes her arms strong.
She perceives that her merchandise is good: her candle does not go out by night.
She lays her hands to the distaff, and her palms hold the spindle.
She stretches out her palm to the poor; yea, she reaches forth her hands to the needy.
She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.
She makes herself coverlets; her clothing is fine linen and purple.
Her husband is known in the gates, when he sits among the elders of the land.
She makes garments, and sells them; and delivers girdles to the merchant.
Strength and dignity are her clothing; and she laughs at the time to come.
She opens her mouth with wisdom; and on her tongue is a Tora of steadfast love.
She looks well to the ways of her household, and does not eat the bread of idleness.
Her children rise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her:
many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.
Grace is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised.
Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her deeds praise her in the gates.
