Proverbs



Chapter 1

The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:
<span class="poetry indentAll">For learning wisdom and discipline;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">For understanding words of discernment;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">For acquiring the discipline for success,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Righteousness, justice, and equity;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">For endowing the simple with shrewdness,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">The young with knowledge and foresight.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">—The wise, hearing them, will gain more wisdom;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">The discerning will learn to be adroit;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">For understanding proverb and epigram,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">The words of the wise and their riddles.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The fear of G<small>OD</small> is the beginning<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote"><b>beginning </b>Or “best part.”</i> of knowledge;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Fools despise wisdom and discipline.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">My son, heed the discipline of your father,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And do not forsake the instruction of your mother;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">For they are a graceful wreath upon your head,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">A necklace about your throat.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">My son, if sinners entice you, do not yield;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">If they say, “Come with us,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Let us set an ambush to shed blood,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Let us lie in wait for the innocent</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">(Without cause!)</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Like Sheol, let us swallow them alive;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Whole, like those who go down into the Pit.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">We shall obtain every precious treasure;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">We shall fill our homes with loot.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Throw in your lot with us;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">We shall all have a common purse.”</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">My son, do not set out with them;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Keep your feet from their path.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">For their feet run to evil;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">They hurry to shed blood.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">In the eyes of every winged creature</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">The outspread net means nothing.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">But they lie in ambush for their own blood;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">They lie in wait for their own lives.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Such is the fate of all who pursue unjust gain;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">It takes the life of its possessor.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Wisdom<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Wisdom </b>In Proverbs, wisdom is personified as a woman.</i> cries aloud in the streets,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Raises her voice in the squares.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">At the head of the busy streets she calls;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">At the entrance of the gates, in the city, she speaks out:</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">“How long will you simple ones love simplicity,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">You scoffers be eager to scoff,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">You dullards hate knowledge?</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">You are indifferent to my rebuke;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">I will now speak my mind to you,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And let you know my thoughts.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Since you refused me when I called,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And paid no heed when I extended my hand,</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">You spurned all my advice,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And would not hear my rebuke,</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">I will laugh at your calamity,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And mock when terror comes upon you,</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">When terror comes like a disaster,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And calamity arrives like a whirlwind,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">When trouble and distress come upon you.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Then they shall call me but I will not answer;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">They shall seek me but not find me.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Because they hated knowledge,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And did not choose fear of G<small>OD</small>;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">They refused my advice,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And disdained all my rebukes,</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">They shall eat the fruit of their ways,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And have their fill of their own counsels.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The tranquility of the simple will kill them,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And the complacency of dullards will destroy them.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">But the one who listens to me will dwell in safety,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Untroubled by the terror of misfortune.”</span>

Chapter 2

<span class="poetry indentAll">My son, if you accept my words</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And treasure up my commandments;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">If you make your ear attentive to wisdom</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And your mind open to discernment;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">If you call to understanding</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And cry aloud to discernment,</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">If you seek it as you do silver</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And search for it as for treasures,</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Then you will understand the fear of G<small>OD</small> </span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And attain knowledge of God.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">For G<small>OD</small> grants wisdom;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Knowledge and discernment are by God’s decree.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Ability is reserved for the upright</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And [God] is a shield for those who live blamelessly,</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Guarding the paths of justice,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Protecting the way of those who are loyal.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">You will then understand what is right, just,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And equitable—every good course.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">For wisdom will enter your mind</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And knowledge will delight you.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Foresight will protect you,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And discernment will guard you.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">It will save you from an evildoer’s ways,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">From a man who speaks duplicity—</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Those who leave the paths of rectitude</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">To follow the ways of darkness,</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Who rejoice in doing evil</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And exult in an evildoer’s duplicity,</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">All whose paths are crooked</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And who are devious in their course.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">It will save you from the forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote"><b>forbidden </b>Lit. “strange.”</i> woman,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">From the alien woman whose talk is smooth,</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Who forsakes the companion of her youth</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And disregards the covenant of her God.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Her house sinks down to Death,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And her course leads to the shades.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">All who go to her cannot return</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And find again the paths of life.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">So follow the way of the good</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And keep to the paths of the just.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">For the upright will inhabit the earth,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">The blameless will remain in it.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">While the wicked will vanish from the land</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And the treacherous will be rooted out of it.</span>

Chapter 3

<span class="poetry indentAll">My son, do not forget my teaching,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">But let your mind retain my commandments;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">For they will bestow on you length of days,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Years of life and well-being.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Let fidelity and steadfastness not leave you;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Bind them about your throat,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Write them on the tablet of your mind,</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">And you will find favor and approbation</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">In the eyes of God and human beings.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Trust in G<small>OD</small> with all your heart,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And do not rely on your own understanding.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">In all your ways acknowledge [God],</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And your paths will be made smooth.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Do not be wise in your own eyes;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Fear G<small>OD</small> and shun evil.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">It will be a cure for your body,<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote"><b>body </b>Lit. “navel.”</i> </span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">A tonic for your bones.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Honor G<small>OD</small> with your wealth,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">With the best of all your income,</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">And your barns will be filled with grain,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Your vats will burst with new wine.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Do not reject G<small>OD</small>’s discipline, my son;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Do not abhor such rebuke.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">For whom G<small>OD</small> loves, [God] rebukes,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">As a father the son whom he favors.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Happy is the one who finds wisdom,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">The one who attains understanding.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Her<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Her </b>See note at <a class="refLink" data-ref="Proverbs 1:20" href="Proverbs.1.20">1.20</a>.</i> value in trade is better than silver,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Her yield, greater than gold.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">She is more precious than rubies;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">All of your goods cannot equal her.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">In her right hand is length of days,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">In her left, riches and honor.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Her ways are pleasant ways,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And all her paths, peaceful.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">She is a tree of life to those who grasp her,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And whoever holds on to her is happy.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">
G<small>OD</small>
 founded the earth by wisdom</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And established the heavens by understanding;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">By God’s knowledge the depths burst apart,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And the skies distilled dew.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">My son, do not lose sight of them;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Hold on to resourcefulness and foresight.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">They will give life to your spirit</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And grace to your throat.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Then you will go your way safely</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And not injure your feet.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">When you lie down you will be unafraid;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">You will lie down and your sleep will be sweet.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">You will not fear sudden terror</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Or the disaster that comes upon the wicked,</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">For G<small>OD</small> will be your trust</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And will keep your feet from being caught.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Do not withhold good from those who deserve it</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">When you have the power to do it [for them].</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Do not say to your fellow, “Come back again;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">I’ll give it to you tomorrow,” when you have it with you.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Do not devise harm against your fellow</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Who lives trustfully with you.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Do not quarrel with someone for no cause,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">When they have done you no harm.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Do not envy a lawless man,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Or choose any of his ways;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">For the one who goes astray is an abomination to G<small>OD</small>,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">But the straightforward are intimates.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">
G<small>OD</small>’s curse is on the house of the evildoer,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">But the abode of the righteous is blessed.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">At scoffers [God] scoffs,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">But the lowly are shown grace.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The wise shall obtain honor,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">But dullards get disgrace as their portion.</span>

Chapter 4

<span class="poetry indentAll">Sons, heed the discipline of a father;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Listen and learn discernment,</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">For I give you good instruction;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Do not forsake my teaching.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Once I was a son to my father,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">The tender darling of my mother.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">He instructed me and said to me,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">“Let your mind hold on to my words;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Keep my commandments and you will live.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Acquire wisdom, acquire discernment;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Do not forget and do not swerve from my words.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Do not forsake her<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote"><b>her </b>See note at <a class="refLink" data-ref="Proverbs 1:20" href="Proverbs.1.20">1.20</a>.</i> and she will guard you;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Love her and she will protect you.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The beginning<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote"><b>beginning </b>Or “best part.”</i> of wisdom is—acquire wisdom;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">With all your acquisitions, acquire discernment.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Hug her to you and she will exalt you;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">She will bring you honor if you embrace her.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">She will adorn your head with a graceful wreath;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Crown you with a glorious diadem.”</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">My son, heed and take in my words,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And you will have many years of life.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">I instruct you in the way of wisdom;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">I guide you in straight courses.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">You will walk without breaking stride;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">When you run, you will not stumble.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Hold fast to discipline; do not let go;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Keep it; it is your life.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Do not enter on the path of the wicked;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Do not walk on the way of evildoers.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Avoid it; do not pass through it;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Turn away from it; pass it by.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">For they cannot sleep unless they have done evil;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Unless they make someone fall they are robbed of sleep.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">They eat the bread of wickedness</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And drink the wine of lawlessness.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The path of the righteous is like radiant sunlight,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Ever brightening until noon.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The way of the wicked is all darkness;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">They do not know what will make them stumble.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">My son, listen to my speech;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Incline your ear to my words.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Do not lose sight of them;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Keep them in your mind.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">They are life to those who find them,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Healing for the whole body.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">More than all that you guard, guard your mind,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">For it is the source of life.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Put crooked speech away from you;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Keep devious talk far from you.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Let your eyes look forward,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Your gaze be straight ahead.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Survey the course you take,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And all your ways will prosper.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Do not swerve to the right or the left;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Keep your feet from evil.</span>

Chapter 5

<span class="poetry indentAll">My son, listen to my wisdom;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Incline your ear to my insight,</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">That you may have foresight,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">While your lips hold fast to knowledge.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">For the lips of a forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote"><b>forbidden </b>Lit. “strange.”</i> woman drip honey;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Her mouth is smoother than oil;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Sharp as a two-edged sword.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Her feet go down to Death;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Her steps take hold of Sheol.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">She does not chart a path of life;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Her course meanders for lack of knowledge.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">So now, sons, pay heed to me,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And do not swerve from the words of my mouth.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Keep yourself far away from her;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Do not come near the doorway of her house</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Lest you give up your vigor to others,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Your years to a ruthless one;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Lest strangers eat their fill of your strength,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And your toil be for the house of another;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">And in the end you roar,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">When your flesh and body are consumed,</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">And say,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">“O how I hated discipline,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And heartily spurned rebuke.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">I did not pay heed to my teachers,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Or incline my ear to my instructors.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Soon I was in dire trouble</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Amidst the assembled congregation.”</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Drink water from your own cistern,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Running water from your own well.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Your springs will gush forth</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">In streams in the public squares.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">They will be yours alone,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Others having no part with you.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Let your fountain be blessed:</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Find joy in the wife of your youth—</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A loving doe, a graceful mountain goat.</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Let her breasts satisfy you at all times;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Be infatuated with love of her always.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Why be infatuated, my son, with a forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote"><b>forbidden </b>Or “a stranger.”</i> woman?</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Why clasp the bosom of an alien woman?</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">For everyone’s ways are before the eyes of God,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Who surveys their entire course.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The wicked man will be trapped in his iniquities;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">He will be caught up in the ropes of his sin.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">He will die for lack of discipline,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Infatuated by his great folly.</span>

Chapter 6

<span class="poetry indentAll">My son, if you have stood surety for your fellow,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Given your hand for another,<sup class="footnote-marker">a</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Given your hand for another </b>Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> </span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">You have been trapped by the words of your mouth,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Snared by the words of your mouth.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Do this, then, my son, to extricate yourself,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">For you have come into the power of your fellow:</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Go grovel—and badger your fellow;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Give your eyes no sleep,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Your pupils no slumber.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Save yourself like a deer out of the hand [of a hunter],</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Like a bird out of the hand of a fowler.</span>

<span class="poetry indentAll">How long will you lie there, lazybones;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">When will you wake from your sleep?</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A bit more sleep, a bit more slumber,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">A bit more hugging yourself in bed,</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">And poverty will come calling upon you,<sup class="footnote-marker">b</sup><i class="footnote"><b>calling upon you </b>Meaning of Heb. uncertain.</i> </span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And want, like a man with a shield.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A scoundrel, an evil man</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Lives by crooked speech,</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Winking his eyes,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Shuffling his feet,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Pointing his finger.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Duplicity is in his heart;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">He plots evil all the time;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">He incites quarrels.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Therefore calamity will come upon him without warning;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Suddenly he will be broken beyond repair.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">
G<small>OD</small>
 hates six things—</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And abominates seven:</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A haughty bearing,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">A lying tongue,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Hands that shed innocent blood,</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A mind that hatches evil plots,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Feet quick to run to evil,</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A false witness testifying lies,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And one who incites siblings to quarrel.</span>

<span class="poetry indentAll">When you walk it will lead you;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">When you lie down it will watch over you;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And when you are awake it will talk with you.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">For the commandment is a lamp,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">The teaching is a light,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And the way to life is the rebuke that disciplines.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">It will keep you from an evil woman,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">From the smooth tongue of a forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote"><b>forbidden </b>Lit. “alien.”</i> woman.</span>

<span class="poetry indentAll">The last loaf of bread will go for a prostitute;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">A married woman will snare a person of honor.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Can anyone rake embers into their bosom</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Without burning their clothes?</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Can anyone walk on live coals</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Without scorching their feet?</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">It is the same with the man who sleeps with his fellow’s wife;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">No one who touches her will go unpunished.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A thief is not held in contempt</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">For stealing to appease his hunger;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Yet if caught he must pay sevenfold;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">He must give up all he owns.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">He who commits adultery is devoid of sense;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Only one who would destroy himself does such a thing.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">He will meet with disease and disgrace;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">His reproach will never be expunged.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The fury of the husband will be passionate;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">He will show no pity on his day of vengeance.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">He will not have regard for any ransom;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">He will refuse your bribe, however great.</span>

Chapter 7

<span class="poetry indentAll">A breed whose teeth are swords,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Whose jaws are knives,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Ready to devour the poor of the land,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">The needy among us.<sup class="footnote-marker">c</sup><i class="footnote"><b>us </b>Heb. “humankind.”</i> </span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The leech has two daughters, “Give!” and “Give!”</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Three things are insatiable;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Four never say, “Enough!”:</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Sheol, an infertile womb,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Earth that cannot get enough water,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And fire that never says, “Enough!”</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The eye that mocks a father</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And disdains the homage due a mother—</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">The ravens of the brook will gouge it out,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Young eagles will devour it.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Three things are beyond me;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Four I cannot fathom:</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">How an eagle makes its way over the sky;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">How a snake makes its way over a rock;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">How a ship makes its way through the high seas;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">How a man has his way with a maiden.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Such is the way of an adulteress:</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">She eats, wipes her mouth,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And says, “I have done no wrong.”</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The earth shudders at three things,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">At four that it cannot bear:</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A slave who becomes king;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">A scoundrel sated with food;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">A loathsome woman who gets married;</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">A maidservant who supplants her mistress.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Four are among the tiniest on earth,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Yet they are the wisest of the wise:</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Ants are a folk without power,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Yet they prepare food for themselves in summer;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The badger is a folk without strength,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Yet it makes its home in the rock;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The locusts have no king,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Yet they all march forth in formation;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">You can catch the lizard<sup class="footnote-marker">d</sup><i class="footnote"><b>lizard </b>Or “spider.”</i> in your hand,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Yet it is found in royal palaces.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">There are three that are stately of stride,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Four that carry themselves well:</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The lion is mightiest among the beasts,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And recoils before none;</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><sup class="footnote-marker">e</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning of verse uncertain.</i> The greyhound, the he-goat,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">The king whom none dares resist.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">If you have been scandalously arrogant,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">If you have been a schemer,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">Then clap your hand to your mouth.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">As milk under pressure produces butter,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">And a nose under pressure produces blood,</span><br><span class="poetry indentAll">So patience under pressure produces strife.</span>

Chapter 31

The words of Lemuel, king of Massa, with which his mother admonished him:
