Genesis



Chapter 1

At the dawn of time, the Cosmic Harmony sparked the energies of existence, giving birth to the cosmos and our world.
The world was yet without form and void, with darkness upon the face of the abyss, and the Breath of the Cosmos was stirring over the face of the waters. 
And the Voice of the Cosmos declared, 'Let illumination emerge,' and so illumination was born.
