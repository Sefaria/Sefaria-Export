Verse 23

"Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; wives of Lamech listen to my statement." His wives did not listen to him, as in Isaiah (32) "Carefree women, come, listen to my voice; confident daughters, listen to my statement." And therefore it says "Because I killed a man for my anger and a lad for my bruising." There is cause for his wives to fear him, because he has killed several people. According to another interpretation, he warned them that they are not stronger than the "man" that "I killed" and if they think that he would not hurt them because they are women, behold, he has also killed a child, so he would not hesitate to harm them as well.

<b>And it became a <i>tanin</i></b> In the wilderness, which is a place of snakes, the staff was turned into a snake; but in Mitzrayim, which is a place of <i>taninim</i>, it was turned into a <i>tanin</i>. A <i>tanin</i> [תנין] is a "crocodile" in this language, like in Yechezkel 29:3 "The great crocodile [<i>hatanim</i> התנים] that crouches in the midst of his streams". And he didn't do the second sign in front of Par'oh, to bring his hand out from his breast and behold it was afflicted with tzara'at like snow, because if he had been afflicted with tzara'at they would have removed him from Par'oh's presence, and something like this is in Bereishit 50, that Yosef didn't have permission to come before Par'oh when he was still <i>tamei meit</i> before he had buried his father. [In Bereishit 50:4 Yosef lays a petition before the court of Par'oh rather than going directly to Par'oh]

Verse 2

<b>And strange fire went out from before God and consumed them</b> This is the same fire from <b>and fire went out from before God and consumed on the altar</b> (Vayikra 9:24 - the preceding verse) as it is said in Sifrei Zuta, and so explains the Rambam: that the fire didn't descend specifically to kill Nadav and Avihu. It was just that they weren't careful not to enter at that moment, and when the fire descended it killed them, and it was like an accident. But regardless, they sinned, since they should have paid attention to this since on that day they shouldn't have brought fire of their own accord, even though on other days this was one of their duties to bring it, as it is said above <b>And the sons of Aharon the Priest put fire on the altar</b> (Vayikra 1:7). And so said the Holy Blessed One: <b>"In My close ones I will be made holy"</b> (Vayikra 10:3) - for those who are accustomed to come near Them need to be careful and separated, so that they do not act out of custom, as it says in Yeshayahu 29:13, "<b>[their fear of Me is like] the commandment of men learned by rote</b>". And this is as it says in Sanhedrin 52a, "burning the soul but the body remains [intact]". Measure for measure, for Nadav and Avihu acted seemingly according to halacha, only they didn't pay attention to what the Holy Blessed One required of them at that moment. For this reason, they were burnt within (the seat of the intellect and reason), and their bodies remained externally whole.

Verse: "And Moses heard the people weeping, each one at the entrance of his tent." Commentary: "He understood that they were crying because they desired meat, unlike the will of the Lord." Verse: "And the anger of the Lord was greatly kindled." Commentary: "He was angry with the people." Verse: "And in the eyes of Moses, it was evil." Commentary: "Not evil concerning the people but the wrath of the Lord towards them, as it is stated nearby." Verse: "Why have you dealt ill with your servant." Commentary: "Because once the Lord became angry with the people, it was as if He was angry with Moses, who was responsible for them. Therefore, Moses concluded." Verse: "And I will not see my evil." Commentary: "And he brings a parable." Verse: "Like a nurse carries a suckling." Commentary: "For when a nursing child cries and demands its needs, yet it does not recognize the good, nevertheless, neither the nurse nor the child become angry."
