Chapter 2



The skill of dream interpretation is in the reading of symbols and signs, and their understanding; it is also in their measured adaptation to reality in the correct proportions. For example, on the simple level, Yosef's dreams indicated ambition and are easy to decipher. Yet the important point is that the dreams don't just reveal the fact that Yosef was a "dreamer," but also that he had hidden abilities in this direction. From that perspective, a dream has the possibility of revealing abilities that will be seen in the future. That is why a dream has the status of prophecy.  Sometimes a prediction is not from the ability to see the possible development of the dreamer's characteristics, but rather from a supernatural grasp of that which will happen in the future. In several places, the Gemara says that sometimes a person does not see [something], but "his constellation sees." The first signs of something the materialization of which is approaching are found in reality and a person catches them. Generally these signs are not sufficiently pronounced to register in his conscious mind, but they pierce into his subconscious and surface in his dreams.
