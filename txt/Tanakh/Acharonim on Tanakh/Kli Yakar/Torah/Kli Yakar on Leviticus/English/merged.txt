Kli Yakar on Leviticus



Chapter 1



Verse 1



Verse 2

“Should any person from you bring forward to the Lord an offering” - It begins in singular and finishes in plural “you shall bring forward your offering.”  Rashi’s interpretation that two people may donate an elevation offering in partnership does not satisfactorily address this verse and its neighbor, nor the beginning and the end, for we don’t know the limits of this idea [of partnership]. And it seems to me that the text wanted to warn all those bringing an offering to God not to stumble in the two ways that Cain and Abel stumbled, who were the first people to offer an offering.  For Cain stumbled in that he brought from the lesser and tawdry crops though he planted grain.  Those who err mortally needed to bring the life of an animal in exchange for their life.  And for [cases of] distress, the Holy One Blessed be He allowed for a poor person to bring a grain offering lacking life and offer it as if that person was offering an animal, as Rashi explains on the verse, “Should a person bring forward a grain offering” (Leviticus 2:1). Abel, even though he brought an offering from the choicest of his sheep, nevertheless, he did not do well either for the offering did not emerge from himself and he did not move quickly to do this commandment on his own accord.  Only after he saw Cain offer an offering did he become jealous of him and Abel from an offering as well to match him.

Chapter 2



Verse 1

<b>When a person brings.</b> God says, Who usually brings a meal-offering? A poor man. I consider it as if he has sacrificed his soul (<i>Menachos</i> 104b). For this reason it says in Parshas Tzav (6:9), It must be eaten as matzoh, the bread of poverty that represents a poor man who is lowly by nature, like the matzoh dough which does not rise. This provides a basis for explaining the verses order in this section: The first ones mentioned are the most prone to sin, because anyone who is wealthier or more honorable than others has a greater urge to sin. A proof of this is what it says, If (אשר) a leader sins (4:22); the expression אשר connotes certainty. This is because his leadership role makes him more prone to sin, since his urges are greater than others. Therefore, it mentions first the calf, which is usually brought by a rich man, and afterwards mentions sheep, then birds, and finally the meal-offering that is brought by the poorest of the poor.

<b>It shall be that when he [realizes his] sin and incurs guilt.</b> No sinner considers himself guilty, for every man thinks he is doing the right thing. This is because he rationalizes his actions, imagining that the other fellow owes him money for some reason, or has wronged him in some other dealings, and he decides he has a right to take what was deposited by him for safe-keeping. Therefore, the Torah calls it ואשם — meaning, when he realizes his error and that he has wronged his fellow man and now recognizes he is guilty. He will then certainly set his heart on repentance and return the stolen object. He should not simply pay for the object, but rather should return the object itself.

Verse 3



<b>In his linen garment.</b> The Midrash interprets the verse: “It is the burntoffering (עולה) on its pyre” — anyone who is arrogant (= עולה) is judged with fire. That the עולה atones for arrogance is hinted in the verse (Yechezkel 20:32): “והעלה על רוחכם (lit. that which goes up upon your spirit).”
 The Torah mentions ashes in this context because the rectification for arrogance is ashes, i.e., one should say, “I am dust and ashes,” like Avraham. This causes that he will be elevated to great heights, for anyone who lowers himself is lifted up by Hashem. Thus, the <i>kohein</i> making the atonement wears these two garments: The linen garment, according to his size, and not too big — to hint that one should not behave in a manner beyond his level. Secondly, the linen pants, which atone for the transgression of illicit relations, which he needs if he was arrogant, as Chazal said (<i>Sotah</i> 4b): Anyone who is arrogant is considered as if he transgressed all the illicit relations. The ashes are placed next to the altar, which represents humility.

Verse 9

<b>It must be eaten as matzoh.</b> Hashem has given the <i>kohein</i> a portion from His fire-offerings. Consequently, he must eat it in the Courtyard which contains the altar, where Hashem’s portion is consumed. This teaches that atonement is achieved through the <i>kohein</i>’s eating of the offering just as it is achieved through its being burnt on the altar.  
The <i>kohein</i>’s portion of the meal-offering is always matzoh, which has an aspect of holiness since it is devoid of leaven. Therefore it says, “It must be eaten as matzoh in a sacred place,” which emphasizes that since it is matzoh it must be in a holy place. The Torah compares the meal-offering to the sin-offering and guilt-offering and calls them “holy of holies” (v. 10), as they atone for sin. This is because a completely righteous man who never sinned is called holy, but a baal teshuvah who sinned and returned is called holy of holies, as Chazal said: “A completely righteous person cannot stand in the place where baalei teshuvah stand.” This is why matzoh needs to be eaten in a sacred place, because it is also holy of holies in that it lacks leaven, the symbol of the evil inclination that profanes a human being’s holiness.

<b>An earthenware vessel … must be broken.</b> The means of purifying vessels parallels the way of repentance. Earthenware vessels which have absorbed a lot of prohibited food cannot be purified through water and must be broken, but metal vessels that absorbed only a little can be purified with water. In the same way, some people have become habitual in transgressing and can be purified only by breaking their heart. Others, however, transgressed only a little and need only a slight rectification. Today, when we have no Beis HaMikdash, the way for the unlearned masses to achieve rectification is through breaking their heart, the vessel in which they ‘cooked up’ the sin. For the Torah scholar, though, rectification for any sin can be achieved through Torah study. 
Thus, the Torah specified the laws of purifying vessels here concerning the sin-offering to teach that today, when there are no sacrifices, repentance parallels the purification of vessels.

Verse 11

<b>And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace-offerings which one shall offer to the Lord:</b> It does not state <i>which one shall offer to the Lord</i> with any of the sacrifices besides the peace-offerings, which are desired without iniquity (alluding to Psalms 59:5) — since they are closer to the Lord than all of the sacrifices that come for a sin. And for that reason, it is written adjacently, <i>Whoever shall bring the sacrifice of his peace-offering to the Lord, he shall bring his offering to the Lord [...]. His hands shall bring the fire-offerings of the Lord</i> (Leviticus 7:29–-30). It mentioned, <i>to the Lord</i>, in all of [these verses], since, "These are what I have desired," said the Lord (alluding to Jeremiah 9:23). And look to the right and see (alluding to Psalms 142:5) that it did not mention that the owner should bring the portion for the High One with his hands with any [other] sacrifice. Only [here] with the peace-offerings, his hands shall bring it. That is because anyone who bears the king's anger and wants to atone and to wipe away the anger from his face sends a gift before him with a messenger; in the way that Jacob said , <i>I will appease him with the gift that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face</i> (Genesis 32:20). But someone who brings the king a present as a favor and a show of honor would then bring his gift in his hands, by himself and not with a messenger. And that is the difference between the sin- and guilt-offerings that come from a sinful act, the burnt-offering that comes from a sinful thought, and the peace-offerings. For it is not fitting that his hands should bring those sacrifices which come to remove God's face of anger, may He be blessed, as it appears like brazenness towards the Heavens. Hence he sends them through the priests. But his hands do bring the peace-offerings, which are a favor and a present.
<b>And some explain the verse,</b> <i>Whoever shall bring the sacrifice of his peace-offering to the Lord, he shall bring his offering to the Lord from his peace-offering</i> — that it is fitting that they should bless him and say, "May it be [God's] will that all of his sacrifices that He bring to the Lord should be from his peace-offerings; not from sin-, guilt- and burnt-offerings." But with the burnt-offering, it states, <i>This is the law of the burnt-offering; it is the burnt-offering</i> (Leviticus 6:2). That is to say, it alone should he bring and not repeat his foolishness, to bring another burnt-offering for a sinful thought. Rather, he should only bring peace-offerings that contain peace between him and his Creator.
<b>And from the angle of hinting (remez), it can certainly be explained as the five times that, "This is the law," is mentioned in this parashah are</b> corresponding to the five books of the Torah. For one who occupies himself with them is as if he offered these five types of sacrifices: The burnt-offering, the meal-offering; the sin-offering; the guilt-offering and the peace-offerings. However the induction-offerings were only temporary and not for [all] the generations. And we find in the same way, five [mentions of], "This is the law," in Parashat Metzora. For there too did our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, say, "What is the remedy for evil speech? If he is a Torah scholar, he should occupy himself with Torah, etc." (Arakhin 15b). And if so, the Torah rescues one from evil speech, which causes these five types of tzaraat. So one who occupies himself with the five books of the Torah is rescued from them. In the way that [Yitzchak Arama] explained in the Akeidah, that in each book, the punishment of the sin of speech is mentioned; so too is it with these sacrifices - one who occupies himself with it is similar to one who has offered these five types of sacrifices:
<b>As one who occupies himself with the book of Genesis is similar to someone who offers a burnt-offering.</b> And that is, "This is the law of the burnt-offering," since the law of the burnt-offering is explained there. As Abel offered a burnt-offering from the firstborn of his flock (Genesis 4:4). And likewise with Noah, it is written, <i>and he brought up burnt-offerings on the altar</i> (Genesis 8:20). And likewise, Abraham, <i>and he took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt-offering instead of his son</i> (Genesis 22:13).  And likewise, Jacob, <i>and he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac</i> (Genesis 46:1).
<b>And one who occupies himself with the book of Exodus is as if he offers a meal-offering.</b> As all of the meal-offerings come as matzah (unleavened). And in this book, all the laws of matzah, its instruction and its connection to the Passover sacrifice – such that it is eaten with matzah – are all explained. And it is written, <i>You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with anything leavened</i> (Exodus 34:25). 
<b>And one who occupies himself with the book of Leviticus is as if he offers a sin-offering.</b> Even though all of the sacrifices are explained in this book, the essence of the book is nevertheless the law of the sin-offering. For once the Jewish people sinned with the [golden] calf, which was the beginning of all the sins, God made space for sinners to be able to come to atonement by way of the sacrifice. And alongside this, all of the sacrifices were mentioned since there is an angle of sin in all of them except for the peace-offerings.
<b>And one who occupies himself with the book of Numbers is as if he offers a guilt-offering.</b> As the entire law of the guilt-offering is stated in Parashat Nasso – <i>When a man or woman commits any wrong toward a fellow man, [...] and that person realizes his guilt, etc.</i> And even though the law of the guilt-offering was already stated in Parashat Vayikra (5:14), it is nevertheless repeated there for a matter that is added there, as Rashi explains there. If so, by way of learning this section with the thing that was added, the whole law of the guilt-offering is completed there.
And one who occupies himself with the book of Deuteronomy is as if he offers a peace-offering. As in Parashat Ki Tavo, it states, You are to slaughter peace-offerings and eat there, etc. (Deuteronomy 27:7). And likewise in Parashat Re’eh – all of the laws of the peace-offerings, of lighter holiness, are stated there. As it is stated, and the blood of your sacrifices shall be spilled on the altar of the Lord your God and you shall eat the flesh (Deuteronomy 12:27). And the laws of the peace-offerings were completed there on account of the few things that were added to them. That is why these five [mentions of], "This is the law of," are stated. Since one who occupies himself with each book has a great particular reward, as if he offered that type of sacrifice that is explained in that book. And the knowledgeable among the people will make the many understand (alluding to Daniel 11:33) this precious matter. For it is clear and correct.

Verse 3


<b>Through those that are near me I shall be sanctified.</b> Hashem keeps two extremes with the righteous: One is that He is more exact with the righteous than with their contemporaries, and the second is that He punishes them even for the slightest mistake. Thereby, when the righteous are punished, all those of lesser stature will formulate a <i>kal vechomer</i> — if they were punished, then we, of lesser stature, how much more so! If Hashem would punish an average man or if He would punish a righteous man only for a big sin, people would not be able to learn this <i>kal vechomer</i>. Moshe concluded that Hashem’s message could only reach everyone if Nodov and Avihu were greater than both Moshe and Aharon, as Rashi writes. For if not, those that were greater would say that no punishment will reach them, and only those of lesser stature would take the message to heart, and even those equal to them would not be reproved, as each one will mistakenly think he is greater than his fellow. Consequently, “in the presence of the <i>entire</i> people I will be glorified” can only be fulfilled through someone that everyone admits is the greatest of the generation.

Chapter 11



Verse 1

<b>Saying to them.</b> The phrase “to them” hints at a very precious matter; it comes to exclude the nations of the world, along the lines of what many commentators write about the reason for the forbidden foods. Some thought they are forbidden for the sake of physical health and healing, because these foods cause harmful fluids in the body; this is the reason favored by Ramban. However, this is not so. We know that all the nations of the world eat the flesh of the repulsive creatures and they are nonetheless healthy and fit.  
It must be that these animals are prohibited because they affect the soul’s health; they make the pure soul repulsive and drive away the holy and pure spirit from a human being, causing an intellectual obtuseness and traits of cruelty; and so we find in the <i>Akeidah</i>.

Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>For he chews his cud.</b> Why does the Torah always begin with their sign of purity first? The explanation is because their pure sign adds extra impurity to their impurity, as we find that Chazal compared Esov to a pig that sticks out its hoofs when it lies down to make it appear as if it is kosher, but its innards are full of deceit. This represents anyone whose inside is not like his outside, in the manner of the hypocrites … Therefore, the pig’s split hoof is a sign of impurity because the split hoof can deceive people and make it appear as if it is kosher.

Verse 8

<b>The priest will atone for her, and she will become pure:</b> This atonement is for the ancient sin of Eve, which caused the pain of birth. And on account of that pain, perhaps [the woman who gave birth] threw out [angry] words towards the Heavens, saying, "If this is so, why should I have conception, labor, and suffering?" And the proof is from that which is written [in the previous verse]:  <i>and she will be purified from the source of her blood</i>. [Meaning,] from that source that brought the sin and the menstruation, and that is the sin of Eve. Also, the expression, "her blood," can connote sin, as in the usage: <i>and their blood [guilt] is upon them</i> (Leviticus 20:27).
 
<b>Some say that this atonement is for the oath</b> that she swears at the time of childbirth that she will never again be with her husband (Niddah 31). For this reason, when she gives birth to a boy she [forgets her pain and] regrets making the oath quickly due to the great rejoicing [of the <i>bris</i>], and therefore her atonement comes sooner. When she gives birth to a female, however, she still has pain and does not regret quickly, so her atonement is delayed.

Chapter 13

Verse 2





<b>He shall be brought to Aharon, the <i>kohein</i>.</b> His purification is only by means of a <i>kohein</i> because Aharon’s descendents have three good character traits that are the opposite of these: 1) The sin of <i>lashon hara</i> causes arguments and a separation between fellow men. Therefore he is healed by Aharon, who exemplifies the trait of peace, for Aharon was “a lover of peace who pursued peace.” 2) Similarly, the sin of haughtiness of spirit is rectified by Aharon who was extremely humble, as Chazal said: What is written concerning Moshe and Aharon is even greater than that which is written concerning Avraham, because by Avraham it says, “I am dust and ashes” whereas by Moshe and Aharon it says, “What are we?” 3) Also, Aharon did not have the negative character trait of lust for money, since the <i>kohanim</i> did not have an inheritance in the Land and only had what they were given from “Hashem’s Table” [the Divine Service in the Beis HaMikdash]. Therefore, they perfected the trait of being satisfied with little and were not at all close to the trait of miserliness, in which one’s entire goal is to amass huge sums of money.

<b>His hair shall be grown long.</b> This is to atone for haughtiness of spirit, for he wanted to be the head over everyone else. His garments shall have a tear in them to atone for stinginess, because miserly people generally have torn and patched clothing. He must cover his head down to his upper lip to atone for the sin of the speech he spoke with his lips. He shall call out, “unclean, unclean,” for someone who besmirches others with his speech shall be called unclean as well, for [the reason he besmirched them is that] he certainly found his own faults in them.

Chapter 14



Verse 1



Verse 2



<b>And this is [the meaning of] that which is written, "This shall be the law of the one with <i>tzaraat</i> on the day of his purification":</b> Since on the day when he rejuvenates a good heart within himself and takes on to repent - on that very day he will be brought against his will to the priest, to learn the path of the Lord from him. And the wording, "and he shall be brought," is not talking about moving from one place to another, but is rather speaking about his heart moving from the evil path that he [was on] to the good path. And that is when he takes upon himself to approach the priest and to 'seek Torah from his mouth.' And about this, it stated, "This shall be the law." And afterwards, once he has taken on to have pure thoughts and to be pure of eyes, not to see evilly; then (in the next verse), "And the priest shall go out beyond the camp; and behold the scab has healed" - [this refers to] that iniquity that caused him to have <i>tzaraat</i> - "the <i>tzaraat</i>, from the one with <i>tzaraat</i>," from someone else (as he is no longer ill with it). So it cannot state, "from the one struck." For behold, it is the iniquity that caused him [to do] his deeds. So it must say, "from the one with <i>tzaraat</i>" - to teach that the spiritual cure came to him from the angle that he had <i>tzaraat</i>. For it is the <i>tzaraat</i> that forced him to repentance. But the Holy One, blessed be He, nevertheless accepts his repentance, even though it was done out of necessity. And you will find the lack attached to such a repentance explained later [in] Parashat Vayelekh on the verse, "and many evils and troubles will happen to them" (Deuteronomy 31:17), see there.

<b>When you will come.</b> Why does the Torah specify regarding the eruptions in houses, “when you will come into the land of Canaan” more than any of the rest of the eruptions?  
The answer that seems closest to the truth to me is because the main reason [for <i>tzora’as</i> in houses] is stinginess, as the Sages said (Erachin 16a) based on (v. 35), “Whoever’s house it is, shall come” — “This is one who made the house exclusively for himself.” The reason Hashem gave him a house filled with all good things as an inheritance was to test him — would he give from the possessions of his house to others or not? For, “The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine, says Hashem” (Chaggai 2:8). Anything that a man gives to others is not his own; in actuality, he is giving from the Divine Table. Therefore it says, “When you will come into the land of Canaan that I will give to you for a possession.” It is not by the power of their sword that they will inherit the Land, but rather: “The right hand of Hashem is exalted” — and that is what will give them the inheritance from the nations. There is no place for stinginess, to think that “My strength and the might of my hand that has accumulated this wealth for me” … Therefore, it is only logical that he should give of his possessions to the poor of his people, and if he does not, “I shall put the eruption of <i>tzora’as</i> in the house of the land of your possession.” This means to say, in the house that you consider to be your possession, as if you acquired it with the might of your hand.

Verse 1



<b>Who brought an [unauthorized] offering before Adonoy [בקרבתם לפני ה'].</b> This can be explained as, “In their closeness to Hashem,” for they were extremely close to Hashem. This is why Hashem was exact with them and judged them even for a slight indiscretion, as it says (Tehillim 50:3): “And around Him it storms furiously.” The closer one is to the King, the more careful one has to be with the King’s honor.

<b>Before Hashem you will be purified.</b> Yom Kippur atones only for those who repent and Hashem obligates each man to purify himself from the sole of his foot to the top of his head from all impurity of iniquity before He atones for them. Therefore, it says, “Before Hashem you will be purified” — in the sense that “before” connotes “previous to” … It furthermore cautions about inner repentance in the heart, which is “before Hashem,” for a matter of the heart is revealed only to Hashem. We should not be like the hypocrites that fast and afflict themselves and pray exceedingly so that they will appear to be righteous, and they seem to be a pure generation in human eyes but they do not cleanse themselves from their inner filth. Therefore it says, “before Hashem you shall purify yourself”.
<b>And our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, expounded</b>, it is specifically sins that are <i>before the Lord</i>, meaning between man and the Omnipresent, for which Yom Kippur atones, but not those between man and his fellow. That is why it is stated, <i>and for all the people of the congregation, he is to effect atonement</i> (Leviticus 16:33). That is to say, specifically when they become one grouping to serve God, shoulder to shoulder. Then the Holy One, blessed be He, accepts their repentance. But not at a time when their hearts are divided. And since it is the way of the world that they request forgiveness on Yom Kippur from one another but on the next day, they go back to their rebelliousness, that is why it stated, <i>And Moses congregated</i> (Exodus 35:1). On the day after Yom Kippur, he made them into a congregation, so that they should be like this all the days of the year. And since all matters of arguments come out of business affairs between a man and his fellow, that is why he judged the people on the day after Yom Kippur. And it was through this that they would be one congregation, such that each person come to his place in peace [alluding to Exodus 18:23]. And it is for that reason that this day is called the Sabbath of Sabbaths [<i>Shabbat Shabbaton</i>]. For the neutralization of business affairs and stillness is a great cause of peace. And it doubled the stillness [here], because every person has emotions and actions that are both external and internal. The external occur by way of the creative tools for each type of work, whereas the internal occur as a result of the fat and the blood that are excited by the wants of the desires. And on the Sabbath day, one only rests from the external. But on this holy day, he rests from both of them, since there is also no eating or drinking. That is why it is called the Sabbath of Sabbaths.

<b>Do not defile yourselves in all these [ways].</b> This implies that they should not come to the extreme of evil that the land will be defiled in all these ways. However, afterwards (v. 26) it says they should not do <i>any</i> of the abominations, which implies that even with a few the land will be defiled. It seems that this is why it mentions two types of punishments — being expelled by the land and having their souls cut off. At first it warns that they should not defile themselves by doing all these, for in all these the nations defiled themselves. They reached the extreme that the land was defiled and He judged its iniquities upon it. The land became like a sick person that vomits, and it expelled its inhabitants. Its measure was filled, and the way of a full measure is to spill and expel its contents because it cannot contain more. Therefore, the Torah warns them that the same should not happen to you, for when a catastrophe comes it destroys the good with the bad. And thus they were exiled in “the exile of the craftsmen and the sentries” and that of Yirmiyahu. Afterwards it warns them, “You shall adhere to My statutes … and not do any of these abominations” — you should not do even some of them. All these abominations were done by the people of the land who came before you and they were punished by being expelled. However, if you will do some of them you will not be expelled; you will not be liable the punishment of being expelled, nevertheless, there is another punishment. And that is that “anyone who will do any of these abominations,” even some of them, although judgment does not require that the good and the bad be destroyed as one, nevertheless, at least, “their souls shall be cut off, those that do these things”.

<b>And you shall love your fellow:</b> Our Sages, may their memory be blessed, said that this is a great general principle in the Torah. And in Tractate Shabbat (31a), there is a story about a certain proselyte who said, "Teach me the entire Torah while I stand on one foot." So Hillel taught him the verse, "you shall love your fellow as yourself" - what is hated to you, do not do to your fellow, and the rest is commentary, go and learn. And it would appear that this proselyte was a righteous convert and he was not mocking in jest to say that he teach him the entire Torah while he literally stood on one foot. Rather, he was certainly requesting that he truly organize all of the Torah’s commandments upon one foundation which is the one foot upon which all of the commandments stand. [This was] so that he not come to forgetfulness, which is common for a convert who did not learn anything about the Torah’s commandments from his youth. Hence he requested from him, that he give him a general principle that encompasses all of the Torah. And by way of a metaphor, he said, "while I stand on one foot." And his intention was that he give him something said quickly in a brief expression - and this is both a foundation and one foot. So by remembering this general principle, he would remember all the commandments of God. 
He taught him the verse, “You shall love your fellow as yourself” because the Sages said (Makos 24a): “Chabakuk came and stood them all upon one: ‘A righteous man will live in his faith.’” This does not contradict Hillel’s words, for all the Torah’s commandments are one of two types: One is the commandments between man and Hashem, and the foundation of them all is faith in Hashem. The second is the commandments between man and his fellow man, and the foundation of them all is, “You shall love your fellow as yourself” … On this foundation he stood up for him the commandments between man and his fellow man. Additionally, he taught him the end of the verse as well, “I am Adonoy,” which is the foundation upon which Chabakuk stood all the Torah’s commandments, that is, faith in Hashem.

Verse 1

<b>The sons of Aharon.</b> Don’t we already know that the <i>kohanim</i> are the sons of Aharon? The answer is that Aharon was holy to Hashem; he was the source of the holiness of <i>kehunah</i>. Holiness was drawn from him to his sons as well. However, they were not like him in every way, because they were removed from the source. Therefore, Aharon, the source of holiness, was not permitted to become impure for any relative, even for his father or mother. Each Kohen Godol from his descendants resembles him in every way, because he receives the influence of holiness in essence from Hashem, as it is written (21:12), “For the crown of his Hashem’s anointing oil is upon him.” The sons of Aharon, however, who received holiness through Aharon, have two aspects: In and of themselves they have no holiness, but from the aspect of their being Aharon’s sons they do have holiness. Therefore, their laws are split: From the aspect of their portion of holiness they must not become impure for distant relatives, but since they are somewhat removed from the source of holiness they are permitted to become impure for close relatives. Therefore the Torah repeats the statement; the first statement was said to the <i>kohanim</i> the sons of Aharon, on the side that they are the sons of Aharon it is proper to command them: “Let him not defile himself with the dead.” The phrase, “And you shall say to them,” is a second command to the aspect of their essence, which does not have so much extra holiness. This is alluded to by the word <i>aleihem</i> [to them], as if they were not the sons of Aharon. Therefore, it is proper to command them, “except to his kin to whom he is closely related” — it is permitted for them to become impure for close relatives.

Verse 2





<b>For his mother and his father.</b> It leads with “his mother,” since his mother is not a descendant of Aharon, but [he may become impure for her] only from the aspect that she is like her husband himself, and this is a greater <i>chiddush</i> [novel idea]. Regarding the Kohen Godol, however, it says, “For his father and mother he shall not become impure,” it leads with “his father,” for this is the greater <i>chiddush</i>, since he is from the descendants of Aharon [and yet he still may not become impure]. Alternatively, this can be explained in the way of “not only this, but even this”: It is easier to hear that he should defile himself for his mother because she endured a lot of pain for him, in pregnancy, birth, and raising him, which is not so regarding the father … Furthermore, it is more certain that she is his mother than that he is his father … Additionally, a woman’s disgrace is greater than a man’s disgrace, and that is why it leads with “his mother.” This teaches us that if he has to take care of both of their bodies he is obligated to take care of his mother first.

<b>And you shall bring a new meal-offering.</b> This is a symbol of the day of the Giving of the Torah, for the Torah must be new for a person every day as if he received it today at Har Sinai. The Torah did not mention explicitly that this is the day of the Giving of the Torah, and it did not mention that Rosh Hashanah is the Day of Judgment, either. There is one reason for both. The Torah did not want to limit the Giving of the Torah to one particular day, because every day of the year a person has to feel as if he received the Torah at Har Sinai on that day. The Sages said that the Torah is compared to a nursing woman’s breast — just as every time the infant wishes to nurse he finds a new taste, so too the Torah, every time someone thinks deeply into it he finds a new flavor. Therefore, it is appropriate we should feel every day as if today we received the Torah at Har Sinai. Therefore, the day of the Giving of the Torah is only revealed in the Torah by alluding to the new meal-offering, which teaches that the Torah is a new meal-offering every day. 
<b>And there was chametz in the two breads, which is compared to the evil impulse.</b> For in the wording of our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, [this impulse] is called the leavening in the dough (Berakhot 17a:2). For when the Torah is present, the evil impulse is not able to cause damage - as the Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Kiddushin 30b), "The Holy One, blessed be He, said, 'I have created the evil impulse, I have created an antidote for it" which is the Torah. And were it not for the evil impulse, the Holy One, blessed be He, would not have brought down the Torah from the elevated beings to the lower beings. For it is with this argument that our teacher, Moshe, defeated the angels, when they said in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, "You have a hidden treasure, etc. and you seek to give it to flesh and blood?" So Moshe answered them, "Is there an evil impulse among you, etc." (Shabbat 88b-89a). And he meant to say that there was a need to give the Torah to the lower beings, in order to give them an antidote for the evil impulse that is enmeshed in them, to fill their lackings. That is why, it is stated (Leviticus 23:17),  "You shall bake them leavened."
This is the reason why the Day of Judgment is not mentioned as well, so a person will not go in the stubbornness of his heart and acquire sins all year round, thinking that he will correct his deeds close to the day when Hashem sits on the Throne of Judgment. Rather, he should envision that each and every day Hashem sits on His Throne of Justice and examines His ledger. In this way all his days will be in repentance …

<b>And you shall rejoice before Hashem.</b> Their rejoicing is considered “before Hashem” only when they are united. Since the rejoicing is specifically on this festival, which is the season of gathering the harvest, the time when people are usually very happy, the Torah warns them that their rejoicing should only be before Hashem. It should not be like the merrymaking of worthless folk whose entire aim is (Yeshayahu 22:13): “And behold, joy and happiness, slaying cattle and slaughtering sheep, eating meat and drinking wine.” They cause an increase of arguments within the people of Israel. With a ‘rejoicing’ such as this the two Temples were destroyed and we were exiled, as it says (ibid. 55:12): “For with joy shall you go forth” … However, with <i>peace</i>, when we will be united and there will be peace among us, we will be brought to Eretz Yisrael. [Based on: “For with <i>joy</i> shall you go forth, and with <i>peace</i> shall you be brought”]. “The mountains and the hills” (ibid.) — refers to the highest level [of the Holy Chariot] — “and they were very high, and they were dreadful” (Yechezkel 1:18). “They shall burst into song before you” (Yeshayahu ibid.) — for the people of Israel will give precedence to every holy thing, as they should, and the young men will not jostle their elders as happened in the Sin of the Spies. “And all the trees of the field shall clap hands” (ibid.) — meaning: the four groups of Jews alluded to by the four species of the <i>lulav</i>, which come from the trees of the field. They will clap their hands to rejoice before Hashem.

Verse 1

God said to Moses on Mt. Sinai: What is the connection between Shemittah and Mt. Sinai? etc. The meaning is that when Moses went up Mount Sinai after seven weeks, that Israel counted 49 days from Pesach to Shavuot, then that mountain was sanctified, and forbidden from ploughing and sowing on the 50th day, on which the Torah was given. And this is the length of time of the Jubilee, to call for liberty and freedom to all of Israel, freedom on the tablets, by means of the voice of the shofar of the giving of the Torah. At that moment God told Moses the matter of Shemittah and the Jubilee, saying that through the number 7 and the number 49 I am giving this holiness to all the land of Israel. For this has a similarity and connection with Mt. Sinai from the side of there being an air that makes people wise (B. Baba Batra 158b). And the Torah [in general] is not like the Torah of the land of Israel and Mt. Sinai. Therefore it was appropriate to give also to that land the holiness of Mount Sinai after the number 49 years, and thus with the number 7. Or in order to make a memorial of the standing at Sinai through the calling of liberty and the blowing of the shofar. This joins to all the other reasons that there is to this mitzvah. Therefore it was said on Mount Sinai, and this is the correct meaning.

Verse 2

<b>The land shall be at rest.</b> There are differing opinions about the reason for this mitzvah. Many say that the reason the land should rest is so that it will continue to be fertile for planting, and this is the reason favored by Rambam in Moreh Nevuchim. However, many disagree with him. They say that if the Torah was concerned about the land becoming infertile, why should they be liable exile for not keeping <i>shemittoh</i>? Their punishment would be the natural consequence that the land becomes infertile. Furthermore, this is not “a Shabbos for Hashem” but rather for the land. Additionally, why does it say (26:34): “The land will then be appeased for its Shabbosos”? What does it have to gain that Israel will be exiled from it and non-Jews will settle there? They will work the land incessantly! 
In order to resolve a number of fine details in the language of this <i>parshah</i> I would say that the reason for this mitzvah is to implant the character traits of faith and trust in Hashem in the people of Israel. Hashem was concerned that perhaps when they would come to the land they would work the soil in the natural way, and when they would be successful they would forget Hashem and remove their trust from Him. They would think that ‘their might and the power of their hand have made them this wealth,’ and the world goes along in its natural way. They would think that the land belongs to them; they are the masters and no one else. Therefore, Hashem took them out of the natural way altogether, for within six years the nations of the world plant their fields for two years and let one year lie fallow, so the land will not be weakened. However, Hashem said, “For six years you shall plant your field,” year after year, and I promise you that it will be more and more fertile and will not weaken. Also, there will be a miracle within a miracle. After having sown the fields for six years, if the sixth year would not be weaker, at least it would not be more fertile. But Hashem declares: On the contrary, in the sixth year it will be much more fertile, to the point where it says (v. 21): “I shall command My blessing to you in the sixth year and it will produce [enough] for three years”.

That which it says, "Do not take from him," implies that it is permitted to take from the wealthy. Likewise in Parshat Mishpatim (Exodus 22:24), it states, "If you lend money to My people, to the poor among you... exact no interest from him." Hence the Torah wrote in Deuteronomy 23:21, "Do not take interest from your brother" - do not take interest from anyone who is your brother, and even though the borrower profits from it. For the main reason for the prohibition of interest is because it erodes the trait of trust [in God]. As anyone engaged in business has his eyes lifted towards God, since he is in doubt whether he will make a profit or not. But one who gives with interest has his profit known and designated. So he will rely on his surety and remove his heart from God. And that which the borrower also transgresses the negative commandment is because he causes the creditor to sin and erodes his trait of trust. This is known from [observing] those that lend with interest. As most of them have little faith, and are 'stubborn-hearted and distant from charity' because of their lack of trust in God. This is the reason for the prohibition of interest in every place...
And it mentioned the word, "interest (literally, bite)," [as well as] "increase"; as it is called, "bite," to the borrower, since it is is similar to [the bite of] a snake - in the way that if it bites his heel, it results in a small scratch; but it [then] proceeds to rise and swell to his skull. At first, it is not noticeable until its fever rises and cannot be cured. But to the creditor, it is called increase, as it increases his wealth and property...

Verse 12

(1) And I will walk among you - the explanation of Rashi "I will walk with you in Gan Eden" - his idea is to remove from our holy Torah any and every claimant who says "I have a place to rest" by stating that there is no point in our Torah that affirms a reward for the soul, if so, the only force of mitzvot is to make one inherit the reward for a soul in the world to come, and the practical reality of doing mitzvot is to receive rewards in this world, this world tied up in disgrace. And many were already aroused to doubt - but here are seven different ideas of our sages, and I come to summarize and organize their opinions so as to stop up the mouths that say untruths about our holy Torah.
The first opinion, Ramba"m's, is that all these promises aren't (considered) the main reward, rather all that is mentioned here are things which remove challenges and obstacles that would prevent a person from serving the Holy One, meaning, if you observe My mitzvot I will remove from you everything that prevents, such as wars, sicknesses, hunger, grief so you will be ablt to serve God without any obstacle, but the essence of the reward is of the world to Come and it is not mentioned so a person would serve the Creator for its own sake, and not because of desire of reward or fear of punishment, see Sevefr Hamada (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Teshuvah 9:1)
The second opinion is from Rabbi Avraham ben Ezra, in his commentary to parashat haazinu, and these are his words: "according to my opinion the Torah was given to all and not to one individual, and the things about the World to Come cannot be understood even in its one thousandth, because it is very deep." And in his opinion, since it is hard to picture such a reward, since what is physical cannot grasp what is spiritual, the Torah concealed this very deep issue from the many due to their limited awareness.
The third opinion is Rabbeinu Bechaye's. It is the same of the Ramban's, and this is that all the promises of the Torah are above Nature, since it is not a natural thing for rain to fall at the time when we do a mitzvah, and that rain should cease from the earth when we do not do the will of the Place, Blessed be. However, the soul going up to the place from which it was hewn is a natural thing to the soul and this is not a miracle, and the punishment of excision [karet] in the Torah is that it will be excised from the place it was hewn, and from this we can learn that if the soul does not sin, she returns to her lodge, to the place where her tent was at the beginning (Gen. 13:3) and it seems that on this it is written "Look to the LORD and keep to His way, and He will raise you high that you may inherit the land; when the wicked are cut off, you shall see it" (Ps. 37:34). Meaning, in that excision of the wicked, promised in the Torah, you will see that there is spiritual reward that God will raise you to inherit the land of the living, when the soul goes up to the place from which was hewn, since it is needed to cut off the souls of the evil ones from there.
The fourth opinion - since in those days everyone was lying regarding the Holy Name's Providence, and were contending that everything that happens in the world is of necessity, and not of the will of the Creator, the Holy One wanted to prove that part of Providence is true through those promises, that eyes could see, that those who do the will of their Creator received good with all those goodnesses, and if the promise was spiritual they would still remain in this denial since the one who wants to lie could distance [oneself] from the end, and the essence of this opinion comes from Rabbeinu Nissim's commentary in the parsha of Bereshit and its root is in the Sefer Kuzari (Kuzari 1:110-112): "The anticipations of other religions are grosser and more sensuous than yours" and the friend explained "But none of them are realized till after death, whilst during this life nothing points to them. The Kuzari: May be; I have never seen any one who believed in these promises desire their speedy fulfillment. On the contrary, if he could delay them a thousand years, and remain in the bonds of this life in spite of the hardship of this world, he would prefer it." And this is, in truth, the best explanation, that the Torah is promising something that a person really wants.
The fifth opinion is that before receiving the Torah they were all idolaters and they did all sorts of specific rituals so as to continue the blessings for produce and bring rain on their time and all other bodily success, and when the Holy One of Blessing gave the Torah and prohibited those rituals, God wanted to assure them that through the keeping of the Torah they would receive those promises, and that through the idolatrous rituals they would lack all those, but the life in the world to come was not included in the promises because it was not assured through those rituals either. And this is the opinion of Rav Saadia Gaon, in the Book of Beliefs and Opinions, and also in the Guide for the Perplexed, third part.
The sixth opinion is that after it says "I will walk about in your midst"(Lev. 26:12) and "I will place My Mishkan among you" (Lev. 26:11) this is the clinging of the Shechina on Israel, even in this world where the soul is entangled in the material, that the soul should cling to the Shechina after she is separated from the material, behold, every promise of the fake religions regarding what happens after death the Torah has promised us also in this life of this world, and the prophecy found with us also proves that, and this opinion you will find in the responses of the Friend to the King Kuzari at the end of the first dialogue in his book, and Rabbeinu Nissim also supported this opinion in a new explanation.
The seventh opinion is that all the promises written in the Torah are for the nation in general, since the world is judged according to the majority, and the promise of rain, produce and peace and so on is for the whole people Israel as one, but the reward of the soul in the world to come is not included in the promises for the people in general, rather, it is to every individual, who will be judged according to that individual's deeds, and this is hinted in the mitzvot of honoring parents and in the sending away the mother bird, and this opinion is found in the Book of Principles (R. Joseph Albo) and in the commentary of the Ramban on parashat Ekev (Ramban on Deuteronomy 11:13) on the verse "with all your heart and all your soul" see there. And on those seven ways great words were said regarding our holy Torah, and so our own eyes see the greatness of the love of the Holy One for our patriarchs Avraham, Itzchak and Yaakov. And were their success in this world the end of their success, what would be the difference between Avraham and the evil Nimrod, who was a king in a domed castle, and Avraham just a wanderer from tent to tent and people to people, and also Yitzchak and Yaakov we have no idea what happened to them regarding the real reward, since this reward promised to their descendants is the end of their reward, what is the profit to the master that after their deaths their children will inherit the land, and they would take leave of this world empty despite all their efforts? What profit would be to them, even in a peaceful time in which all kings were successful and reigned in this world, and some even more than others, only if a great goodness comes to the righteous , which is their portion and the inheritance of the patriarchs, and of all their descendants, since there is only one Torah to all.

<b>I will make your heavens like iron and your land like copper.</b> Moshe said the opposite (Devarim 28:23): “And the heavens above your head will be like copper and the earth that is beneath you, iron.” This is because most commentaries agree that this entire rebuke corresponds to the Destruction of the First Temple, and that of Parshas Ki Savo corresponds to the Destruction of the Second Temple. It is known that iron is harder than copper. In the First Temple period, their main sin was towards Heaven, through the worship of the stars and the constellations, as it says (Yirmiyahu 44:18), “But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of heaven.” Therefore, the heavens were as hard as iron, as it says (Iyov 20:27), “The heavens shall reveal his iniquity and the earth shall rise up against him.” During the Second Temple period, however, they did not worship idolatry. Their main evil was in the earth through baseless hatred and disputes among themselves, and the earth was destroyed as in the generation of the flood. Therefore, the earth was harder [like iron] than the heavens [like copper].

<b>The sound of a blown leaf will put them to flight.</b> This is what it says (v. 37): “They will stumble over one other.” This is speaking about discord, which is more common among the people of Israel than any other nation in the world. It says (v. 33): “I will scatter you among the nations.” Israel is scattered as by a winnowing fan, as when a person winnows barley with a fan, and not one of them (the barley grains) clings to the next; so too, the people of Israel are detached from one another even while in the land of their enemies. Although exiles usually console one another, the people of Israel are not that way, for they are scattered and separated even when they are in exile. Each one pushes his fellow man with a strong arm and seeks to depose him from his situation, to incriminate him and fall upon him. Achiyah the Shilonite cursed them in this fashion (Melachim I 14:15): “And Adonoy shall smite Israel as a reed sways in the water.” Each reed is pushed and sways from the wind blowing on it, and in addition to being blown by the wind, each reed pushes the other one. So too, each Jew is pushed by the wind, which refers to the kingdoms … and in addition to gentile nations’ pressure on the Jews, each Jew pushes his fellow into his pit. Therefore, they were compared here to a blown leaf, for the leaf is very fragile and blown around by the wind. Yet despite this, each leaf pushes the other one and hits against it. So too, the Jews strike one another with the whip of their tongue, either by informing against one another to the gentile nations, or with malicious slander in the Jewish neighborhood. The verse refers to this when it says, “the sound (voice) of a blown leaf.” Therefore, it says immediately after, “They will stumble over one other.” 
This is a further allusion to the large amount of profane, false conversation spoken in all the neighborhood streets … for each one rejoices at his fellow man’s misfortune. If he finds the opportunity to speak maliciously about him it is as sweet as honey in his mouth … and in our generation this attribute alone is a sufficient reason for the length of our exile.

<b>I will [then] remember My covenant.</b> It mentions the names of the forefathers here in reverse chronological order because in each generation the people of Israel rely on their forefathers’ merit. Therefore, it mentions them in reverse chronological order, in the style of “not only this, but even this” — not only in the merit of Yaakov who was the latest, and it is obvious that his merit has not yet been used up, but even “My covenant with Yitzchok” who preceded Yaakov, and for many years the people of Israel have already used his merit.  
<b>And I will remember the land.</b> There is a place to judge favorably and say: If the people of Israel sinned, did Eretz Yisrael ever sin? And yet the land was afflicted (Devarim 29:22): “Sulfur and salt all its land was burnt”.
