<b>Also at me was Hashem angry.</b> Moshe mentioned the decree against him here, because one depends on the other. Because of the decree against the spies they were forced to remain in the desert for forty years. As a result of this the time arrived for Miriam to die. Because of her death the well ceased and there was no water. And through this Moshe ended up hitting the rock and being punished.

<b>I pleaded to Hashem.</b> Rashi explains that even though the righteous can claim rewards based on their good deeds, they ask the Almighty only for an undeserved gift. This is difficult to understand, for why would one think that they would ask for reward based on the good deeds that they had already performed? A person can never have any claim that Hashem owes him, because all of the mitzvot that a person does can never be sufficient to pay Hashem back for all the goodness that He does…  
The answer to this question is that when it says that the righteous can claim based on their good deeds it does not refer to those good deeds that they have already performed, but to those good deeds that they will do in the future. For it is understood that no righteous person wants to claim any physical benefit, except in order to be able to fulfill another mitzva… If so, Moshe could have based his request on those good deeds that he would do in the future if Hashem would grant him his request. This is something real.

<b>Look out for yourself and guard your life exceedingly. “</b>Guard yourself” means look after your physical body. It does not add “exceedingly” as it does after the second part of the verse which refers to guarding one’s soul, because one must be even more careful to protect one’s soul than one’s body.

<b>Only your forefathers.</b> The word “only” is to exclude the heavens and the heavenly heavens. Out of all of those, Hashem only desired your forefathers. This is in accordance with the opinion of the kabbalists, who said that the righteous are greater than the acts of heaven and earth. All agree that everything else was only created for the sake of mankind.

<b>Look, I place before you today.</b> “See” is singular. “Before you” is plural. This is what our Sages teach us: A person must always view things as if the entire world is half righteous and half wicked. If he performs a single <i>mitzvah</i> he tips himself and the entire world to the side of merit. Therefore Moshe spoke to every individual, “See” that he should see in his thought that every single action affects all of them.

<b>Judges and officers.</b> The explanation is that this verse is a command to those who have the authority and power to appoint judges, that they should appoint them in order that they will judge. The judges should not show favoritism even to those who appointed them. This is the meaning of the phrase, “appoint for yourself,” as if to say, “over yourself”. It follows <i>a fortiori</i> that the judges should judge all the people justly.

<b>If you will not guard to perform.</b> The prophet Yeshaya is certainly speaking about a generation who fulfill the mitzvos. However they do not do so out of fear of Hashem, but for some other purpose, to achieve a material goal, or out of fear for some person who forces them to act against their will. This causes Hashem’s name to be profaned, for without doubt Hashem examines the hearts and know that they are not acting for the right reason, and He punishes them for their evil thoughts. Those who witness this see them involved in learning Torah and performing mitzvos, and will criticize Hashem’s actions. Therefore our Sages have said: If you see a generation for whom the Torah is not dear to it, gather to yourself (Berachot 63a). The Sages were not speaking about a generation that does not learn Torah at all, but is referring to those who learn but not out of fear of Hashem. Therefore the Torah is not dear to them, as their main goal and priority, but they have some other value and goal… Hashem will find reasons to destroy the wisdom of the wise people of such a generation, because such learning does not create a pleasant spirit before Him.

<b>Life and the good.</b> If it is life that you seek, look towards the good, to do that which is good in the eyes of Hashem. And if you ask, why “good” is not mentioned first, for it is through the good actions that one merits life, the answer is that it comes to warn us not to do that which is good in Hashem’s eyes only in order to live. But rather to live in order to do that which is good. A person should not seek life for material gain, but only in order to spend his life serving his Creator.

<b>Remember world history.</b> Remember that the world was created in six days, and protect it so that it does not become destroyed. <b>Study the generational epochs.</b> This refers to two sets of ten generations; from Adam until Noach, and from Noach until Avraham. Consider that if Hashem is patient, and does not punish immediately, this may lead you to think that there is no Judge and no justice. Perhaps you will decide, as a result, to act wickedly. Know that you are trusting in lies, and understand from those generations who angered Hashem until eventually he destroyed them with the flood, and until Avraham came along and received the reward of all of them.

Verse 39

<b>For it is I! I am the One!.</b> It repeats the word “I” to negate the view of those who say that there are two deities, one who rules over good, and one who rules over evil… The proof of this is that it states, “I put to death and make live … and no one can rescue from My grasp.” If there was another deity with Me, he would save from My hand, and the dead would live, the living would die instantly. From this you can understand and know that there is no other deity Our Sages learned from here the source for the resurrection of the dead in the Torah (Pesachim 68a), as it states, “I put to death and make live.” One might think that this refers to putting one person to death and making another person live, therefore the verse states, “I smite and I will heal.” Just as smiting and healing are referring to the same person , so too death and life refer to the same person. The support for their opinion is that it first states, “put to death” and then “make live”.

<b>And Hoshe’a.</b> He was only named Yehoshua due to Moshe’s prayer that Hashem should save him from the plot of the spies. As long as there were people from that generation alive, he was called by the name Yehoshua. However, once all of that generation had died out, there was no longer a need to call him by that name, and Moshe returned to calling him Hoshe’a.

Verse 48

<b>At the very height of that day.</b> The day of death is called a person’s sunset, but when Moshe died, “His appearance was not dulled and his freshness did not fade.” Therefore it was as if he was still in the middle of his life, and at the height of his day.
