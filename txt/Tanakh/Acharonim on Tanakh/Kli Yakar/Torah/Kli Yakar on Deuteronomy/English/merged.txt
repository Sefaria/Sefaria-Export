Kli Yakar on Deuteronomy



Chapter 1



Verse 1







... And on Tisha b'Av was the incident of the spies and on that day was born the character trait of baseless hatred (Sinat Chinam) within Israel as it is written (Deut. 1:27) “It is out of hatred for us that יהוה brought us out of the land of Egypt, to hand us over to the Amorites to wipe us out." And on this Rashi explained "What is in your own mind about your friend, you imagine is what is in his mind about you" (Sifrei Devarim 24:3). Because they each thought after this (the incident with the spies) that they hated their fellow and thus it made sense to them to think that God hated them as well...

<b>Also at me was Hashem angry.</b> Moshe mentioned the decree against him here, because one depends on the other. Because of the decree against the spies they were forced to remain in the desert for forty years. As a result of this the time arrived for Miriam to die. Because of her death the well ceased and there was no water. And through this Moshe ended up hitting the rock and being punished.

Verse 3

Many say that this verse...has a hint for that time and for the future. This idea of “going around” refers to the many years which the Jewish People will be wandering (in exile). As long as Israel is in exile they are told, “turn to the Tzafon”. The rabbis interpreted this to mean, “If the time of (the nation of) Esau comes, hide yourselves. (ed.- The root of the word for North, Tzafon, can also mean “to hide”)
This idea of hiding means that if a Jewish person in exile finds some small amount of success he should hide it from (the people of) Esau, because there is no nation which is more jealous of Israel than Esau, because in their opinion everything (the Israel has) is stolen from Esau because Jacob our forefather took the blessings from Esau.

<b>I pleaded to Hashem.</b> Rashi explains that even though the righteous can claim rewards based on their good deeds, they ask the Almighty only for an undeserved gift. This is difficult to understand, for why would one think that they would ask for reward based on the good deeds that they had already performed? A person can never have any claim that Hashem owes him, because all of the mitzvot that a person does can never be sufficient to pay Hashem back for all the goodness that He does…  
The answer to this question is that when it says that the righteous can claim based on their good deeds it does not refer to those good deeds that they have already performed, but to those good deeds that they will do in the future. For it is understood that no righteous person wants to claim any physical benefit, except in order to be able to fulfill another mitzva… If so, Moshe could have based his request on those good deeds that he would do in the future if Hashem would grant him his request. This is something real.

<b>Look out for yourself and guard your life exceedingly. “</b>Guard yourself” means look after your physical body. It does not add “exceedingly” as it does after the second part of the verse which refers to guarding one’s soul, because one must be even more careful to protect one’s soul than one’s body.
<b> Another explanation:</b> These two guardings are about the positive commandments and the negative commandments, through which he guards all of the limbs and blood vessels upon which the human abode stands. For our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, already said (Zohar, Vayishlach 170b) that the 248 positive commandments correspond to the 248 limbs and the 365 negative commandments correspond to the 365 blood vessels in a person. As about this is it said, "'Revere God' (Ecclesiastes 12:13) - that is the negative commandments; 'and observe His commandments' - that is the positive commandments; 'for this is all that a person is' - like the number of his limbs and blood vessels." And they also said (Job 15:20), "All of the days of an evil person, he travails with pain (<i>mitchollel</i>)" - meaning [he is] a dead corpse (<i>met challal</i>). For with every sin, he damages one of his limbs or one of his blood vessels. And it appears to me that one can differentiate between the expression, corpse; and the expression, dead - via the same distinction that there is between positive commandments and negative commandments. As dead implies [the body died] on its own, whereas corpse means that it was actively killed. And one who transgresses positive commandments transgresses passively; so behold he damages a limb, and it dies on its own. But one who actively transgresses a negative commandment, behold he actively kills one of his blood vessels and becomes a corpse (<i>challal</i>) and emptied (<i>challul</i>) of the blood within it. And 'the blood is the lifeforce,' so its evacuation from even one blood vessel is more dangerous than the death of a limb. That is why the Torah was more stringent with the punishment of a negative commandment than with a positive commandment. As the damage of the blood vessels is more dangerous than damage to a limb. And about this, it stated, "Guard yourself" - that is the guarding of the limbs. Because they are the essence of a person, their guarding depends upon keeping the positive commandments. "And guard your life exceedingly" - that is the guarding of the blood vessels. Since 'blood is the lifeforce,' and it requires much guarding, that is why it states, "exceedingly"; and this guarding is by way of the negative commandments. And this explanation is correct.
, since they are the essence of a person.....

<b>Only your forefathers.</b> The word “only” is to exclude the heavens and the heavenly heavens. Out of all of those, Hashem only desired your forefathers. This is in accordance with the opinion of the kabbalists, who said that the righteous are greater than the acts of heaven and earth. All agree that everything else was only created for the sake of mankind.

<b>Look, I place before you today.</b> “See” is singular. “Before you” is plural. This is what our Sages teach us: A person must always view things as if the entire world is half righteous and half wicked. If he performs a single <i>mitzvah</i> he tips himself and the entire world to the side of merit. Therefore Moshe spoke to every individual, “See” that he should see in his thought that every single action affects all of them.

“Slaughter from your cattle…as I have commanded you”:  Not at all times, but only periodically, when the desire becomes strong.  And what was said, “just as the gazelle and the deer are eaten, so may you eat them” (Deuteronomy 12:22), and as it said, “When one hunts game of an animal or bird” (Leviticus 17:13), and our Sages said, “the Torah taught proper behavior, that a person should eat meat only on this kind of occasional basis” (Talmud Bavli Chullin 84a 46).  The explanation of the matter is that if people accustom themselves to eating the animals present in the home, ox, sheep, or goat, then all day they will have desire and will accustom themselves to eat it on a daily basis, but they don’t eat it until they hunt game of animals or birds in the forest or desert, where there is danger and great effort to hunt them, then their desire will be calmed, because the eating isn’t worth the great pain and effort.

Verse 10

<b>For because (<i>biglal</i>) of this thing, the Lord will bless you:</b> The Rabbis, may their memory be blessed (Shabbat 151b), learned from the expression, <i>biglal</i>, that  it is a cycle (<i>galgal</i>) that repeats itself in the world. But many wondered about the expression, since <i>biglal</i> is not [related to] <i>galgal</i>, as behold, a [letter], <i>gimmel</i> is lacking [in the former]. And I say that their intention, may their memory be blessed, was to understand <i>biglal</i> as related to the usage, "and they would roll (<i>gallelu</i>) the stone" (Genesis 29:3). And [by this], they wanted to say [that] when poverty goes around among people from this one to that one - as is customary - then "the Lord will bless you," and cause that it not roll over and fall upon (crush) you when it falls on people. And axiomatically, we learn that the thing goes around in the world like a cycle, such that everyone who gives will in the end [also] receive. As that is the trait of everything that exists in all three of the worlds, that everything that gives will come back to [also] take, in the way that we explained above in Parshat Bereshit on the verse, "the sixth day" (Kli Yakar on Genesis 1:31:5). As with everything that exists, the thing moves like a cycle, that each one of them gives and receives, except for God alone - He gives and does not receive.
<b>And it appears that the reason for the thing is</b> that God did not want man to establish himself on the land - he and his seed - forever, in the way that it stated (Leviticus 25:23), "And the land may not be sold forever, as the land is Mine." And if a man would never come to this trait - not he and not his seed - he would establish himself on the land forever, and forget that 'to God is the land (earth).' Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, causes that every man come to this trait, either he or his seed; to know and make known that they are all like strangers upon the land, and [that] to God is the universe and its fullness. And that which it is written after [this] verse to give a reason why it goes around upon people, "Since a destitute person will never be lacking from within the land"(Deuteronomy 15:11), is because [being] within the  land necessitates this matter, as mentioned. "Therefore, I command you: open your hand to your poor," so that they will also give to you or to your seed. But not to both of them, as it is stated (Psalms 37:25), "and I have never seen a righteous man abandoned, and his seed seeking bread" - meaning to say he and his seed, but rather [it can only be] either he or his seed. And with this, this verse does not contradict that which the Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Shabbat 151b) [that] either he or his seed come to be included in this trait. And some say that the lack of a <i>gimmel</i> in the word, <i>biglal</i>, is to say that it follows from the iniquity of refraining from acts of loving-kindness. As the [letter combination] <i>gimmel-dalet</i> [as expounded by] the Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, [means] to give to the poor (<i>gomel dalim</i>) and the lack of a <i>gimmel</i> (which represents giving) to the poor, moves the cycle [forward].

<b>Judges and officers.</b> The explanation is that this verse is a command to those who have the authority and power to appoint judges, that they should appoint them in order that they will judge. The judges should not show favoritism even to those who appointed them. This is the meaning of the phrase, “appoint for yourself,” as if to say, “over yourself”. It follows <i>a fortiori</i> that the judges should judge all the people justly.

<b><i>If a man has a wayward and rebellious son</i>:</b> Our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Sanhedrin 71a:15), "There has never been a wayward and rebellious son, and there will never be one. So why was it written in the Torah? [So that you may] expound and receive reward [for your study of it]." Yet there is nevertheless an obligation incumbent upon us to explain this thing: Why did the Torah write something that does not exist at all? Also, we should reflect upon why <i>and all Israel will hear and be afraid</i> (Deuteronomy 21:21) is stated here amu more than with other specific commandments. And also why is "and they shall not still act wantonly" not written here, as it is in Parashat Shoftim (Deuteronomy 17:13)? But perhaps the reason of the thing is because there has never been a wayward and rebellious son and there will never be one, and the section was only written so that the sons will hear and be afraid and not act like this thing. So that which is written, <i>and all Israel will hear and be afraid</i>, is that they will hear this section and the law that is written in it, and the sons will be afraid to provoke the eyes of the honor of the father and mother [alluding to Isiah 3:8]. And that is why "and they shall not still act wantonly" is not written here. As the word, still [<i>od</i>], indicates something that was done before, which will not still be done. But this is not the case [here], since there never was a wayward and rebellious son at all and this section was only written to impose terror and trepidation on sons.

Chapter 22



Verse 1

The rabbis interpreted (Brachot 19b), with regard to the laws of returning a lost object, it is stated: “You shall not see the ox of your brother or his sheep go astray and ignore them; return them to your brother” (Deuteronomy 22:1). The baraita explains that the seemingly extraneous expression and disregard them must be understood to give license that at times you disregard lost objects and at times you do not disregard them.
For example, a respected elder for whom it is socially inappropriate [to chase after an ox, is exempt from this mitzvah.]  And similarly, someone may be exempt in the manner described by the rabbis (Avot 4:18), "Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says...do not seek to see your friend at the time of their humiliation."  For there is no distinction between physical or financial humiliation, they are equivalent in the circumstance when it is impossible to rescue them [from that humiliation] and return whatever it is that has wandered off.
This is what the text is referring to when it literally says, "Do not see the ox of your friend or the sheep that has wandered off," i.e. when they are so completely astray, that they might as well be submerged in the river.  In such circumstances, [when the text literally says,] "you should ignore them", [it means that] it is necessary for you to conduct yourself as if you had not seen.
Certainly, when the verse says, "you must take it back", it is teaching us that if you have the means to take them back, if they are not so completely astray, but rather it is possible for you [individually] to return that which has wandered away, then you shall return them to your fellow; you are obligated to try to see, in order to rescue them.

<b>If you will not guard to perform.</b> The prophet Yeshaya is certainly speaking about a generation who fulfill the mitzvos. However they do not do so out of fear of Hashem, but for some other purpose, to achieve a material goal, or out of fear for some person who forces them to act against their will. This causes Hashem’s name to be profaned, for without doubt Hashem examines the hearts and know that they are not acting for the right reason, and He punishes them for their evil thoughts. Those who witness this see them involved in learning Torah and performing mitzvos, and will criticize Hashem’s actions. Therefore our Sages have said: If you see a generation for whom the Torah is not dear to it, gather to yourself (Berachot 63a). The Sages were not speaking about a generation that does not learn Torah at all, but is referring to those who learn but not out of fear of Hashem. Therefore the Torah is not dear to them, as their main goal and priority, but they have some other value and goal… Hashem will find reasons to destroy the wisdom of the wise people of such a generation, because such learning does not create a pleasant spirit before Him.

<b>Life and the good.</b> If it is life that you seek, look towards the good, to do that which is good in the eyes of Hashem. And if you ask, why “good” is not mentioned first, for it is through the good actions that one merits life, the answer is that it comes to warn us not to do that which is good in Hashem’s eyes only in order to live. But rather to live in order to do that which is good. A person should not seek life for material gain, but only in order to spend his life serving his Creator.

<b>And it appears that the whole essence of this <i>hakhel</i> (assembly) is on account of repentance.</b> As our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Vayikra Rabba 30:7) that the first day of the Holiday (Sukkot) is called the first [day] of the calculation of iniquities. Therefore they must immediate make preparation towards repentance; and that preparation is is this assembly, in which the king assembles the people and reads from Deuteronomy. For most of the book is words of chastisement for sins and words of submission. And it is already known that the assembly is very necessary for repentance. As by their being assembled, they would be one group and they would turn together to do repent to God in order that the penitents be [considered] a public. As it is specifically during the ten days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur that the Holy One, blessed be He, accepts the repentance of an individual. However during all [the rest] of the days of the year, the Holy One, blessed be He, only accepts the repentance of the community (Rosh Hashanah 18a). And this is the meaning of that which our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, [in Vayikra Rabba], "'And you shall take for yourselves on the first day' (Leviticus 23:40) - and is it the first; is it not the fifteenth [of the month]? Rather it is the first [day] in the calculation of iniquities, etc." But whey did Scripture mention  this matter specifically in the verse that is speaking about the four species; and why did it not mention this in the verse that is speaking about sitting in the sukkah? Rather it is because in the taking of the four species, it hints to all of the four clusters of Jews becoming one group, as explained above in Parashat Emor (Kli Yakar on Leviticus 23:40). And the verse needs to give a good explanation and understanding for why it is specifically on this day that they were commanded to do this commandment that instructs that all of Israel be one group to atone for one another. Rather it is because from Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kippur, the Holy One, blessed be He accepts even the repentance of the individual. Hence they do not yet need to be one group, so that the penitents be [considered] a public. And from Yom Kippur to the holiday of Sukkot, they do not do iniquities, since everyone is occupied with the commandments of the sukkah and the lulav. And 'a commandment drags along [another] commandment.' Hence, generally 'no harm befalls the righteous' until the first day of Sukkot, which is the first [day] of the calculation of iniquities. Hence they need to make a preparation for repentance; and that preparation is that they should all be one, like these four species. And that is why it is stated, "And you shall take for yourselves on the first day" -- to give an enriching reason, why I commanded you about the taking of these four species in a group specifically on this day: Because it is the first day of of the calculation of iniquities. Hence you need to make a preparation towards repentance for all of the days of the year. And this preparation is when you become one group, like these four species. Then God will accept your repentance, since 'Behold, God does not despise the mighty' (see Berachot 8a).
And this is also a reason for this <i>hakhel</i> (assembly). As in addition to the taking of these four species on the first day of the festival, God commanded to make another impression similar to [the impression made by] it, at the end of seven years. Since the seventh year also causes assembly and peace by way of one not planting and growing upon it. And the destitute of His people eat on it, since the [landowners] are not permitted to hold on to their produce on the seventh year as [would usually be the way of] an owner. And without a doubt, this is is a cause of peace, since all disagreements are from the trait of "what's mine is mine" [and] "this one says, 'it is all mine.'" And this is not so [prevalent] on the seventh year, since [even if] in the positive acts, not all are equal, in the negative acts, all are equal, and this is truly the way of peace. And so [too] with the festival of Sukkot, when everyone goes out from a permanent dwelling to a temporary dwelling and sits under the 'Sukkah (hut) of His peace.' Behold, [accordingly] on the first of the intermediate days, the king was commanded to make an impression about peace and this is the matter of <i>hakhel</i>. As all of this is a preparation to repentance, and [so] he reads from Deuteronomy words of exhortation and rebuke. And this is [the meaning of] what they said, "'the men' to learn, etc, 'the youngsters' - why are they coming, to bring reward to those that bring them." Since in the time when Israel repents, they offer supplications in front of Him, may He be blessed, for the forgiving of sin and say, "If not for our sake, then do it for the sake of those weaned from their mothers, who have not sinned." [This is] as it is found in the text of 'Avinu Malkenu' - Have mercy on our sucklings and on our youngsters. And we [also] say, "Do it for those weaned from their mothers, etc." And this is the reward that is given to those that bring them, from the youngsters - that they will say in front of Him, may He be blessed, "Do it for the sake of these youngsters that are brought to the House of God," in the same way as it stated in Joel 2:16, "Collect the people, sanctify the assembly, gather the elders, collect the sucklings, and those that suck the breasts, etc.

Chapter 32



Verse 1

<b>Hearken, O heaven as I declare, let the earth hear my mouth’s sayings:</b> Rashi explained, "Why did he call heaven and earth as witnesses against them? If the Israelites will say, 'We have never accepted the covenant,' who can come and refute them? Therefore he called heaven and earth as witnesses against them - witnesses that endure forever and ever, such that if they should act worthily, etc." According to those books that follow the version, "that endure forever and ever (<i>vaed</i>), such that if they act worthily, etc." - it follows that it is all one reason. But according to the books that follow the version, "And also (<i>veod</i>), such that if they act worthily," it follows that it is two reasons. But (if they are two reasons) there is a difficult with the first reason: And do heaven and earth have a mouth to testify? And it should not be said that there are no words being spoken here besides that if heaven gives its dew and rain and the ground gives its produce when they do the will of God and not give it when they do not do His will, that is the sign that the Israelites accepted the covenant - if so, why did he say, "and also, such that if they acted worthily, etc."? That is the same as the first reason!
And it appears that we can resolve [the difficulty] with this version, based on what our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Shabbat 88a:6), "'The sixth day' (Genesis 1:31) - to say that everything is suspended and waiting until the sixth day of Sivan: If Israel accepts the Torah, it is for the better; but if not, the world will return to chaos and disorder." And it follows that since we see that heaven and earth exist today and that they did not return to being chaos and disorder, it is a sign that the Israelites accepted the Torah. And this is what he wrote that "heaven and earth will testify against them." And what is the testimony that they will testify? "That they exist forever," since their existence gives credible testimony of the Lord that the Israelites have already accepted the Torah. For, if not, they would not be existing and continuing but rather would have already returned to chaos and disorder.
And the reason of the thing, that the existence of heaven and earth is dependent upon the Torah, is because the higher beings and the lower beings are two opposites and require an intermediary to bind them. And that is man who is constructed from matter and form; and this construction is through the Torah. For without the Torah, man would be compared to a beast and he would not have a portion from the higher beings. Hence one who occupies himself with Torah brings peace between the retinue above and the retinue below, so that they not oppose each other - since the intermediary binds them. This is what is written, "May my teaching come down as the rain." As anything poured is a connection. And just like the rain that falls from the heaven to the earth appears as if it connects heaven to the earth - since  all that is poured is similar to a connection - so too is my teaching (<i>likchi</i>), being the Torah that was taken (<i>lekucha</i>) from heaven to the earth, the place through which earth and firmament kiss.

<b>Remember world history.</b> Remember that the world was created in six days, and protect it so that it does not become destroyed. <b>Study the generational epochs.</b> This refers to two sets of ten generations; from Adam until Noach, and from Noach until Avraham. Consider that if Hashem is patient, and does not punish immediately, this may lead you to think that there is no Judge and no justice. Perhaps you will decide, as a result, to act wickedly. Know that you are trusting in lies, and understand from those generations who angered Hashem until eventually he destroyed them with the flood, and until Avraham came along and received the reward of all of them.

I am the One!.</b> It repeats the word “I” to negate the view of those who say that there are two deities, one who rules over good, and one who rules over evil… The proof of this is that it states, “I put to death and make live … and no one can rescue from My grasp.” If there was another deity with Me, he would save from My hand, and the dead would live, the living would die instantly. From this you can understand and know that there is no other deity Our Sages learned from here the source for the resurrection of the dead in the Torah (Pesachim 68a), as it states, “I put to death and make live.” One might think that this refers to putting one person to death and making another person live, therefore the verse states, “I smite and I will heal.” Just as smiting and healing are referring to the same person , so too death and life refer to the same person. The support for their opinion is that it first states, “put to death” and then “make live”.

<b>And Hoshe’a.</b> He was only named Yehoshua due to Moshe’s prayer that Hashem should save him from the plot of the spies. As long as there were people from that generation alive, he was called by the name Yehoshua. However, once all of that generation had died out, there was no longer a need to call him by that name, and Moshe returned to calling him Hoshe’a.

Verse 48

<b>At the very height of that day.</b> The day of death is called a person’s sunset, but when Moshe died, “His appearance was not dulled and his freshness did not fade.” Therefore it was as if he was still in the middle of his life, and at the height of his day.
