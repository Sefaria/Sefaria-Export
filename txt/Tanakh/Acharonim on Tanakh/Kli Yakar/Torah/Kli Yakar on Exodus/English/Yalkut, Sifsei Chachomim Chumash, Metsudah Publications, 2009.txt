<b>He caused the wild animals to depart.</b> The wild animals and the locusts left Egypt after the plague, but the frogs died in Egypt, because Hashem wanted to teach the Jews that someone who is willing to give up his life for a sanctification of Hashem’s Name will be rescued. Therefore, all the frogs died except for those who jumped into the hot ovens. Later in history, Chananyah, Mishael, and Azariah derived that they should be willing to give up their lives for a sanctification of Hashem’s Name from the fact that only these frogs were saved from death.

<b>Vigil (or “guarding”) for Hashem.</b> Afterwards it is written that the night was, “guarded … for all the B’nei Yisrael.” This can be likened to two companions who said to one another, “You hold my lamp and I will hold yours.” The two “lamps” are that of the <i>mitzvah</i> (see Mishlei 6:23) and that of the human soul (see Mishlei 20:27). Thus Hashem told B’nei Yisrael that if they would guard the “lamp” of the Pesach sacrifice, He would guard their souls by not allowing the destroyer to enter their homes.

<b>Moshe took … with him.</b> While the rest of Yisrael were collecting booty, Moshe was occupied with <i>mitzvos</i>. The phrase “with him” hints that Moshe disdained to take from the spoils because unlike the good deed of tending to the dead, it would not go “with him” to the next world. On account of this the Sages (<i>Sotah</i> 13a) apply to him the verse, “One who is wise in heart takes (i.e. acquires) <i>mitzvos</i>” (Mishlei 10:8). Moshe may have chosen this particular <i>mitzvah</i> to engage in at this time to remind B’nei Yisrael of the day of death so that they would be less enthralled by the plunder.

<b>[Which] Your hands established.</b> Every aspect of the Tabernacle was made in according with Hashem’s instructions, as the verse states, “You shall erect the <i>mishkon</i> according to its rules as shown to you on the mountain” (26:30). Therefore it is as if Hashem’s own hands established it. Rashi cites the verse, “My hand also founded the earth and My right hand spanned the heavens” (Yeshayahu 48:13), indicating that heaven and earth were each created with a single hand. He contrasts this with this verse in which it is implied that the Mishkon was fashioned with two hands. The idea is that the hosts of heaven were created with Hashem’s right hand while those of earth were created with His left. But because the Mishkon—the <i>Shechinah’s</i> dwelling place on earth—serves as the intermediary between the two, it was created with both hands. Similarly, Adam was created out of earth from the site of the future Beis Hamikdosh because he, too, serves as an intermediary between the hosts of heaven and those of earth.

<b>A kingdom of <i>kohanim</i>.</b> By accepting the Torah they would become kings even over the <i>kohanim</i>, because a Torah scholar is considered superior to a <i>kohein</i>. Thus the Sages rule that the life of a <i>mamzer</i> who is a scholar takes precedence over that of a <i>kohein gadol</i> who is an ignoramus (<i>Horayos</i> 13a).

Verse 2




<b>Who brought you out.</b> Hashem did not identify Himself as the one who created heaven and earth because there were no witnesses to that event. He also refrained from mentioning that He created human beings since it can be argued that it would have been better for them if they had <i>not</i> been created (see <i>Eiruvin</i> 13b), whereas Hashem wished to mention only the unambiguous good He had done for them.

<b>If you do mistreat him.</b> The verse should have really said “If you mistreat <i>them</i>,” since it is speaking of all three categories mentioned above. It uses the singular to hint that sometimes the mistreating of the orphan alone causes both him and his mother—the widow—to cry out to Hashem. Thus the oppressor incurs a double punishment. Alternatively, since Hashem is the “Father of orphans,” if one mistreats an orphan one mistreats <i>Him</i> as well, so to speak. This causes His attribute of judgment to cry out in heaven at the same time that the orphan cries out on earth.

<b>I will set My meetings with you there.</b> The Divine light radiated outward from the ark affecting everything around it. Thus the Sages say that it actually bore those who appeared to bear it. This is a hint that those who support Torah scholars are actually supported by them.

<b>Make its dishes … and its supports (<i>menakios</i>).</b> The word <i>menakios</i> derives from a root meaning “clean.” The <i>menakios</i> are listed last to indicate that one’s livelihood must be “clean” of any taint of theft and that one must welcome the poor in a way that is “clean” of any taint of disgrace.

And if You do not agree to bear their sin, how can I endure the sight of their destruction?

But whenever he received instruction from God he was required to remove it, in keeping with the Sages’ principle that one who is prone to shame cannot learn (Pirkei Avos 2:5).

<b>All that Ad-noy commanded Moshe.</b> It is never mentioned anywhere that Moshe actually told Betzalel what he was to do. Apparently Betzalel knew through Divine inspiration. That is why it is written that he did “all that Ad-noy commanded Moshe,” and not, “all that Moshe commanded <i>him</i>”.

Verse 2

<b>The <i>mishkon</i> was set up.</b> The passive voice is used here to indicate that it could not be set up by human hands. Nevertheless Hashem told Moshe to make the attempt and it would arise on its own. This was a hint concerning all human endeavor—a person may begin a task but it is Hashem who completes it.
The setting up of the <i>mishkon</i> is mentioned three times—in verses 2, 17 and 18. Some say that this is to foreshadow the three Holy Temples. Thus in two of the verses (2 and 18) the verb appears in active forms, indicating that the B’nei Yisrael would build the first two Temples actively through their merits. In verse 17, by contrast, the passive voice is used, which hints that the construction of the Third Temple would not depend upon human merit. Thus the Sages teach that when the time comes, the redemption will take place even if the generation is entirely guilty..
