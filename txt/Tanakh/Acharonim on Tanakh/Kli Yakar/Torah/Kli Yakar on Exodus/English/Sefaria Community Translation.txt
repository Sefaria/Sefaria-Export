<b>The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, etc.:</b> Some say that the midwives were Egyptians. And it is as if it stated, "the midwives of the Hebrews." For were it not so, what is the novelty in its stating (Exodus 1:17), "But the midwives feared God?" But our Rabbis said (Sotah 11a), "Shifra is Yocheved; Puah is Miriam, etc." Yet it can be [further] examined: As maybe it was the opposite, that Puah was Yocheved and Shifrah was Miriam! And what is Scripture telling us with this, that they changed their names? And it appears to me that Puah is an expression of speech, and that would certainly indicate Miriam, as she was a prophetess. That is like our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Megillah 14a), "'And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took' (Exodus 15:20) - for she would prophesy, 'My mother is destined to bear a son who will deliver the Jewish people.'" And in Parshat Vaera, Rashi explains (Rashi on Exodus 7:1) that <i>nevuah</i> (prophecy) is an expression of speech, formed from the expression, "I will create a <i>niv</i> (expression) of the lips" (Isaiah 57:19). Yocheved is Shifrah, based on her returning to her beauty (<i>shufrah</i>), similar to the beauty of her youth, when she was 130 years old, like that which happened to Sarah. And this miracle was also a sign that a son that would deliver the Jewish people was born to her. For this miracle was not done to her for nothing! And that is why Scripture tells us to look at how foolish the counsel of Pharaoh and all of his magicians was: For he called midwives who called themselves by the names, Shifrah and Puah, which indicate that the redeemer will come from them; and they were the very ones that would give birth to the redemption. So how could they could kill their literal children? Whereas Pharaoh did not notice the change of their names, saying it was nothing. Moreover, Scripture told us their names, since it was an indication that they were not in doubt about the redemption. For there was room for them to be in doubt about it, as it is written in Ezekiel (Ezekiel 20:8), "and I thought to destroy [...] them in the land of Egypt." But these names indicate the birth of the redeemer. And it is for this reason that they did not do that which Pharaoh said to them. As if they were in doubt, perhaps they would have agreed to the decree of Pharaoh. For it is better for [the Jewish children] to die [as] infants than for them to be born into emptiness and confusion, and to be in distress and subjugation for all of their days. 
<b>And that which is written, "but if (<i>im</i>) it is a girl, let her live"</b> - which appears extra - appears to be in order that they will understand, "if (<i>im</i>) it is a boy," as an expression connoting, even though. This is like, "And <i>im</i> the Jubilee occurs" (Numbers 36:4), the understanding of which is, even if the Jubilee occurs. So too can the expression, "<i>im</i> it is a boy," be understood [as], even if it is a boy who is needed for work; nevertheless kill him. [Hence we would think], all the more so a girl. [So it needs to] teach and say, "but if it is a girl, let her live."

Verse 2

<b>And she saw that he was good.</b> That the house was filled with light, as it says <b>"And God saw the light, that it was good"</b> (Bereishit 1:4). And for this reason she hid him, because she was scared that the Mitzrim would see this light, and through the light see the boy also. For this reason she hid him more than all the other boys [were hidden]. And further, [she worried] that they would sense through the excess of light that this [boy] was the redeemer who would bring "from darkness to light, and from subjugation to redemption" (Siddur Ashkenaz, petitionary prayer before returning the Torah to the Ark on a weekday). And perhaps she thought that the light was created with him in order for her to learn from it to conceal him, just like the Original Light which was stored away for the righteous in the future to come (see Rashi on Bereishit 1:14).
And the number of <b>"three months"</b> is an allusion to the light of the Torah, which was stored away until the third month, which is Sivan. This is as we learn from the verse "They lay up sound wisdom for the upright" (Mishlei 2:7) - therefore, she could not hide him further. And see further in the verse of "your sandals from on your feet" (Shemot 3:5), that Moshe was totally lacking in materialism, and he would illuminate from both his parts [i.e. body and soul], and his human body was full of light. And this miracle proves his quality for the future. And it seems that regarding the reality of this light that was born with him, it's written "and she opened it, and saw it; the child" (Shemot 2:6). What is "and she saw it; the child"? Our rabbis of blessed memory said, "she saw God's Presence with him". And God's Presence, who mentioned its name? Rather "and saw it" refers to her finding of the light which is mentioned obliquely in the saying <b>"for he is good"</b> (Shemot 2:2). And this light she saw with the child, because [the particle] את <i>et</i> is used in the place of עם <i>im</i>. And because of this he seemed like an older youth, because they were connected together, the boy and the light. Because of this, it's said "and she saw it", wishing to say: the light to the boy, the light with the boy.

<b>And the children of Yisrael sighed from the labour and cried out</b>. It's a bit difficult to mix them, and to teach "they sighed and cried out from the labour". It seems that the sighing was internal and because of the labour; however, the crying out wasn't dependent on the labour. For they thought that they were worthy of redemption due to their deeds, even without this harsh labour - however, in the eyes of God they were wicked and sinners and unworthy of redemption except due to their labour, as it is written "For I am very angry with the nations... for I was a little angry, but they helped forwards the evil" (Zechariah 1:15). For this reason it's said "their cry for help... went up to God, because of the work" (Shemot 2:23) - that "they helped forwards the evil", as is said.
One can also explain that there were two groups in Yisrael. The good amongst them cried out and prayed to God to save them from the weight of the labour, but the lesser among them didn't pray to God - they cried out like merchants to God, and regarding them it says <b>cried out</b>, and for this reason it didn't combine them together, since it says <b>And the children of Yisrael sighed from the labour</b> - these are the good ones, who prayed to God, for the principal of prayer is in the heart. <b>And cried out</b> - speaks of the lesser ones, who <b>cried out</b> like merchants. For this reason it says <b>"And their call for help ascended to God"</b> (ibid.) - from the groups, those who called for help to God from the labour, their calls for help ascended, but not from the crying group who did not pray.
And some say that this "crying out" was that they said openly to the faces of the Egyptians that it was for the death of the king, as though they mourned him. But the "sighing" was internal, from the labour, for out of fear they couldn't say in front of the Egyptians that they were crying out from labour. And we don't mix them this way.

<b>But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief:</b> This expression is not stated in any of the plagues besides the plague of the frogs. That is because [with] all of the [other] plagues when they were removed, they were completely removed. Not a single trace of them remained after they were removed. If so, it is not such a novelty that Pharaoh stiffened his neck again. For the past does not exist. However, the frogs did not go away completely after the plague was removed. For they did not go away, but rather died and putrefied the land. So he should have given in at least because of the putrid smell that remained from the frogs. So it is about this that it states — like an answer — <i>But when [Pharaoh] saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart</i>. As a putrid smell only does damage in a narrow place. But in a spacious place, the smell is not so overpowering. Hence when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, since the land of Egypt was spacious and the bad smell would not do him damage, he therefore, <i>hardened his heart</i> like at the beginning.

This month shall mark for you the beginning of the months; it shall be the first month of the year for you: Since The Holy One, Blessed be God, showed Moses with His finger the moon in its newness saying "like this you see and shall bless" thus He said this is the beginning of the month. That is to say this newness (of the moon) will be for you the beginning of the months, that every time that you see the newness of the moon in this picture you will have a new month for every month of the year. And after God gave this sign - it was known about all the days of every month of the year to make them new for  every month of the year

<b>Watching (or “guarding”) for Hashem: Afterwards it is written that the night was, “guarded … for all the B’nei Yisrael.” This can be likened to two companions who said to one another, “You hold my lamp and I will hold yours.” The two “lamps” are that of the mitzvah (see Mishlei 6:23) and that of the human soul (see Mishlei 20:27). Thus Hashem told B’nei Yisrael that if they would guard the “lamp” of the Pesach sacrifice, He would guard their souls by not allowing the destroyer to enter their homes. And about this guarding , it stated, "a night of watching for Hashem to bring them out of the Land of Egypt." And corresponding to Israel's guarding the mitzvot, it stated, "watching for all of the Children of Israel throughout their generations."</b>

Our sages  (מנחות לז) explain that you place the Tefilin on the weaker hand, to teach us that Tefilin should be placed on the left hand.  the reason for this is that the intellect and our physicality are problematic for on another; when the one rises, the other falls.  When the physicality of an individual is afflicted, the strength of the intellect waxes.  The reason for the affliction in Egypt is to bring the physicality of the Jewish people into the iron crucible (as mentioned in Deut.) and through that the intellect of the Jew would overcome it.  Both young and old men will attest to this - when a man is young and immature, his physicality is in the ascendancy over his intellect, and when he gets older his intellect has the ascendency over his physicality.  It is for this reason that Solomon (In Ecclesiastes) says "Don't say that your earlier days were better than your later ones because it is not out of wisdom that you ask it" - because at the age of 60 comes wisdom, length of days and understanding.
So it is with the two hands of man, because the left hand is weaker. and it is weak because of its proximity to the heart, which is the source of intellect. (This is therefore the primary example of the intellect controlling the physical forces in man). However, the right hand is next to the liver which is the source of desire.  The liver does not oppose the physical force in any way, because that is the source of its strength.  The place in which the intellect dwells (the heart) makes the hand weak.  Therefore when the verse says: והיה לאות על ידכה it is as if it is says that it should be a sign on your heart, because the heart is the reason that his hand is weak.  Indeed, this is the reason of the Tefilin should be put on the arm, (to remember that the whole purpose of the exodus from Egypt is to teach this concept), and the Shel Rosh should be between the eyes, because the heart and the eyes are the two agents of sin (as seen in the Yerushalmi).  Therefore these two places need something to remind them about the existence of G-d and his capacity, and through that will return from sin.
Another explanation is as follows:  It mentions the weaker hand to teach us that man will not overcome (anything), but that G-d is the one who battles in any war. (Wearing Tefilin on the left weaker hand illustrates that) a man's hand is weak and he is unable to do anything with it unless G-d will help and strengthen his hand.  This is the meaning of the verse in Psalms (תהלים טז ח) I place G-d opposite me always, He will never move from my right hand).  At first, King David was upset that the heart should be on the left hand side, and the liver on the right hand side of a human being.  This would indicate that G-d created man in such a way that his desires should be the main force, and his intellect subservient to his desires.  Afterwards, David states: G-d is opposite me - his right hand supports my left hand.  It is through that I am confident that I will never be moved - that the strength of his desires will never move him from the straight path.  this is because the hand of G-d provides power and energy to the heart (intellect) which is opposite him as he stands in front of G-d.  It is for this reason that he states afterwards: "Therefore my heart rejoices" to see that G-d is supporting my left hand. David ends the psalm stating: the pleasantness of your right hand is eternity" - not in my right hand, because the intellect is supported by the right hand of G-d which is opposite my left hand.  Therefore, G-d commanded us to put on Tefilin, where the name of G-d is engraved on them on the weaker hand, to teach us that the strength of G-d's right hand gives our left hand strength.  This is the meaning of the verse:כי בחוזק יד הוציאנו ה' ממצרים.  G-d's right hand opposite man's left hand took us out of Egypt.  This in turn teaches that no deed is dependent upon man's action, rather with the help of G-d.

"And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him": this verse is juxtaposed to the previous verse "the jews ascended(Egypt) armed. because it states in the midrach Yalkut of this portion that the jews would journey in the desert with two arks, that of the ark of the Shechinah(the tablets of moses) and that of Joseph and the nations of the world would ask , what is the point of having this ark of joseph together with the ark of the coveneant and they would answer,"this one fulfilled what is in this one", for joseph fulfilled all the ten commandments etc.
Another point, because Moses saw that the lord blessed is he, was leading them towards the sea of reeds , and moses thought"lest the sea stop us, it will split in the merit of joseph" the reason we explained above in Parshat Vayeishev

1 AND YOU [MOSES] RAISE UP YOUR STAFF AND STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND OVER THE SEA: In the Midrash (Shemot Rabah 21:9), they said: "Because the Egyptians would say that without the staff, [Moses] wasn't able to do all the miracles that he did, therefore G-d said: "Remove your staff and stretch out your hand because 'raise' is a word often used to mean remove." And I will now give a reason for the matter why, specifically at the Splitting of the Sea of Reeds, G-d commanded Moses to make the staff exemplify what was occurring above [in the Heavens]. For behold,  all the Plagues were brought about through the Finger of G-d therefore down [on Earth] they were brought about through the staff of Moses, because the staff is comparable to a finger. But by the sea, [G-d] smote with the entire Hand. As it says, "And Israel saw the Great Hand etc." Therefore, G-d said to Moses that he should make the staff exemplify this and remove the finger-like staff and stretch out your [Moses's] entire hand, which exemplified the Strong Supreme Hand of God. Therefore, it was said that "Israel saw the Great Hand" and through this they saw that Moses did not act through the power of the staff in all of these great and mighty actions because he needed to stretch out his hand, it modeled the Strong Hand above therefore they [the Israelites] believed in G-d and Moses, His Servant. That they returned from their declarations when they said in the past that through the strength of the staff, [Moses] did all this.
2 AND FROM THIS YOU WILL UNDERSTAND, THAT IN TRUTH, what was the sin of Moses by the Waters of Strife? Because here [by the splitting of the sea] the exact opposite was stated, because here it was stated: "Raise up your staff" which means 'Remove your staff' and "Stretch out your hands" and through this they [the Israelites] came to believe. And there [by the waters of tribulation] it was said: "And he [Moses] raised his hand and he struck the rock with his staff," [which implies] that he removed his hand because he had not done the action with his hand, but rather with his staff, and therefore returned the earlier remarks--[of the Israelites] who said that it was with the power of the staff that he did everything--to their place [i.e. the thoughts were believed again] and with this diminished the belief [of the Israelites] as it is written: "Because you did not [cause them to] believe in me." And this matter will be explained, G-d willing, better in its place in the Section (Chukat 20:8).

Verse 2

(1) They traveled from Rephidim and they came to the Sinai wilderness, and they camped in the wilderness. And Israel camped there opposite the mountain. Look at how many repetitions are written here. What would be missing in the [meaning of the] text if it would have just said, "They traveled from Rephidim and they encamped in the Sinai wilderness opposite the mountain"? Any why does it first say "they camped" [in plural] and then afterward "he camped" [in singular]? First it says, "in the Sinai wilderness," and then it just says, "in the wilderness." And first it refers to the mountain using the name Sinai, and after it just calls it a mountain. And it seems that all of this is proving to us that Bnei Yisrael are not worthy of receiving the Torah until there is peace among them. "The owners of collections that are all stemming from one shepherd." (Ecclesiastes 12:11 - see pshat and parshanut there) All of the paths of Torah are paths of peace. And the result of separation of hearts, where one forbids something and another permits it, is that the Torah becomes 2 Torahs. That is why the [previous] pasuk specifies that that it was in the third month on this day that they came to the Sinai wilderness. It is teaching that this month [of Sivan], which has the astrological sign of twins, is instructing us about attachment and love, that together [the Jews] should be perfect[ly connected] to each other like twins. And then there will be great peace among those who love Torah. And there is also a hint to this in the fact that there are 2 luchot which are like twins to each other, with 5 commandments [on one] parallel to 5 [on the other]. 
(2) Afterwards, it says "they journeyed from Rephidim," which means to say, "from the place in which they fought and had disagreements" since the place was called "Masah uMerivah" [which means "Test and Fighting"], and the letters of רפידי׳׳ם spell פרידי׳׳ם, [which means "separate"]...because of the distance that existed between them.  Our Sages (in the Talmud Sanhedrin 106a) expounded the name to connote רפו ידים "their hands weakened," since one is dependent on the other, since through growing distant from one another, they weakened their grip in the Torah.  When it says that they travelled Rephidim, it means from that place — from that separation between them and they arrived at the Sinai desert, which caused them to join together in unity.  [How so?] Desiring honor and power is the reason for all fighting and all illness.  Through seeing Mount Sinai, the lowliest of all the mountains — and realizing that this was the mountain that the Holy One Blessed Be He desired to rest [His Presence] on — through this they realized that God chooses the humble, and inspired them to choose humility themselves, which is the catalyst for peace.  This is why the Torah relates to them in the plural initially, "they came to the Sinai desert," "they encamped in the desert."  As long as they were [aimlessly] in the desert they remained divided in their minds.  They were not yet of one heart and mind like a single person.  However, as they came to be opposite the mountain, and it was related to them that on this mountain God would descend, then [it switches to the singular] ויחן ישראל — they were like one person with a single heart and mind...

<b>And you shall make the cover:</b> ... And the two keruvim resembled children, to teach that [only] if the teacher is like an angel of God and clean of all sin - like a one-year-old child - they should then seek Torah from his mouth. And he needs to be clean from [sin against] God and from [sin against] man. For the wings were pointed upward to [show] his fulfilling [his obligation] towards the Heavens. And one was looking towards the other [to show] his fulfilling [his obligation] towards the creatures, [and also] teaches about the peace that is given to those that love the Torah. And they were twins together in peace and friendship. (Verse 20:) "The faces of the cherubim being turned toward the cover" -  that the entire endeavor of their attention (literally, faces) be to the Torah in the ark; not like those that are sages in their own eyes and expound for their own glory and not for the glory of the Torah.

<b>You shall make an altar for burning incense:</b> According to that which is apparent, these two altars were arranged to atone for the sinning spirit (<i>nefesh</i>). For the bronze altar comes to atone for the physical portions [of man] and for the body stricken with the stone of sin. And for it do we offer animals coming in its place, since they are similar to the substance of a man. And the design of the altar proves [this]. For its height is similar to the height of an average man, three cubits. And likewise are animals similar to the animal spirit within man, [such that we sacrifice] a spirit in place of a spirit. And it is for this reason that it is stated with the meal offering of a poor person (Leviticus 2:1), "And when a spirit offers." For he does not have the wherewithal in his hand to offer the spirit of an animal in place of his spirit, so he brings an offering of fine flour. Hence, Scripture states, "a spirit" - I (God) count it as if he offered his spirit [nevertheless].

The commentators argued about whether "these" [are the records] applies to the making of the Mishkan mentioned in parshat Vayakhel, or if it applies to what will be mentioned in this parsha. They also wondered why Moshe made an accounting of what he'd done with the silver and copper but not an accounting of what he'd done with the gold?! Therefore "I shall hazard a guess" (lit. "my heart shall imagine") to say: that "these are the records" applies to the making of the Mishkan mentioned before, since they had already completed the labors of the Mishkan in general and specific, and all that they had to do with the silver and copper had already been completely completed, and therefore Moshe was happy that they'd completed the work with silver and copper and was excited to give an accounting to remove himself from any suspicion. And he didn't want to delay until they'd also finished the priestly garments which are mentioned in this parsha to give an accounting of the silver and gold and copper all at once since of all the things mentioned in this parsha, none have any silver or copper. Since the labor with silver and copper was done, he saw fit to give an accounting immediately. But regarding the gold there was no need to yet give an accounting since they had not yet made the priestly garments discussed in this parsha, and those [garments] had gold, and they still needed more gold and there was no way to yet give an accounting of the gold.
And if you say there is still a difficulty: why did [Moshe] not do an accounting of the gold after the priestly garments were finished? An answer to this is: since it says in the midrash (Shemot Rabbah 51:6) brought by Rabbeinu Bachya on this parsha, and this is his language: When Moshe came to give an accounting, 1775 shekels were missing and he forgotten and did not know what he'd done with them. A divine voice cried out: "And [from] THE one thousand and THE seven hundred and seventy five he made hooks for the pillars" (Ex 38:28) to fulfill what is said: "not so my servant Moshe who is the most faithful in my house" (Numbers 12:7). Up until his [Rabbeinu Bachya's] language. It seems that the author of the midrash felt that the two extraneous heh's - as it says "v'et HAelef u'shva HAme'ot" and it should have read: "v'et elef u'shva me'ot" as it says early, "me'at kikar" (38:25) [just "a hundred kikar"] not "HAme'at kikar" ["THE hundred" kikar] with the definitive heh, so why was the definitive heh usd with the words "thousand" and "hundred" in this verse? It must be because Moshe forgot and did not know what he'd done with them [meaning the silver and copper] and Israel was accusing him saying he took them for himself! A divine voice rang out and said, "THE thousand" you are speaking about and THE seven hundred you are saying Moses took - it's not so! Rather he made hooks for the pillars. If so [meaning if that's what happened], after Israel saw that heaven testified for him [Moshe], therefore they no longer wanted to receive an accounting of the gold from him because they said: "If he'd have withheld something for himself from gold - heaven would not have testified for him regarding silver [which is much less valuable], for in the end, he never fulfilled an accounting [for the gold] and a divine voice [nevertheless] called out, "he is faithful in all my house," including regarding the gold! Therefore he didn't give a gold accounting.
There are those who say that even initially they [the people] did not request an accounting from Moshe, but rather Moshe himself wanted to acquit himself, and that is why it says  "which were accounted at the word of Moshe."
