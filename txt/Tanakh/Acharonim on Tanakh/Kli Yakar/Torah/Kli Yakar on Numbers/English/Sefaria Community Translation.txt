Kli Yakar on Numbers



Chapter 1



Verse 1



Verse 2

Even though Rashi translates it as a language of counting.Because in terms of the counting there raised and lifted up on top of all the other nations that don't have hashgacha pratite like a bundle of wheat that didn't go in the way of the head of the granary to give them a number.so to the other nations that don't have hashgacha pratite like it says they only have hashgacha klalite like the animals and wild animals of the land but every person of Israel is led by hashgacha klalite and even one from them is thought of a full bundle and even if one of them falls its viewed as many of them fell.And therefore Hashem a count like the stars like it says to them like an army calling out in his name.So it says here to teach us that the jews are like the stars forever and ever and each one has hashgacha partite But theres a question?The pasuuk says and There is a count to bnei yisroel. It comes to teach us they have a count and after that it says like the sand of the sea that can't be counted or can't be measured.according to the simple explanation there's no contradiction according to hashem of course they have a count like the stars tats are found and you could count them they have a number to show hashem rules over them in every single detail and therefore people can't measure and people can't count people of course they won't be able to the count the potential of a person.

However, there is an ethical place to interpret the words of Rabbi Elazar in another way, and to say that this is why the nazir is called a sinner because if he was an innocent and honest man, he would not feel the need to make an oath and be careful, because who will stop him from separating himself and distancing himself from things that are permitted without this oath? The fact that he felt the need to make a vow to become a nazir is because he knows his own spirit that he can't stop himself. This is why he takes actions and swears against the evil inclination. This causes him pain because anything that you prohibit from yourself via an oath, the evil inclination attacks him the most. It is because of this that he is considered a sinner , as we learned "And when you will cease to vow you will not sin" ( Deuteronomy 22:22 ) This is how the evil inclination provokes and tells him is not enough what the Torah forbade you in the evil inclinations imprisonment and you needed to add to it, because in everything the Torah forbade even though that caused us to be provoked by the evil inclination as it is written that he provokes Israel more than the other nations ( Sukkah)In any case, the two will stand against him - the written Torah, and the oral Torah.

And the reason they begun with meat and ended with fish is that fish points to promiscuity in sexual relations more than the expression "meat", since fish reproduce more than any animal alive, and they were using the word "flesh" as a compromise: "if only we ate meat" actually means "we want to be uninhibited in sexual relations as the other animals, even though we won't be like the fish - at least they did not ask all of it. But in any instance they did say "we remember the fish that we used to eat free in Egypt" (Numbers 11:5): when we were in Egypt all was permitted to us, even as to live like the fish, and now, let us at least be like the other animals, and this is what they mean by "if only we ate meat". And if one listens closely [one can see that] all this is very much like the simple meaning of the text, their intent was to ask for meat, which is the food that most warms a person up, and expands the sexual desires, and this is expressed in the language of "gluttonous craving" [the Hebrew expression is doubled 'they craved a craving'], meaning, they craved for a food that would enhance their sexual cravings. ...

Verse 10

Moses heard the people weeping, every family apart, each person at the entrance of his tent - one cannot say that they gathered by their families, and cried [together] because it says "each person at the entrance of his tent", so it's obvious that [they were crying] due to each families worries, "and the anger of Ad-nai flared and in Moses' eyes it was bad." Precisely now, but before this it was "bad in the ears of Ad-nai" alone, since Moses did not comprehend their intent. And what is written "we remember" has a meaning connected to the past; and "that we used to eat" has a meaning connected to the future, as they said all the time "let's turn our head and return to Egypt" (Numbers 14:4), in that exact moment "we recall the fish" that we will eat when we get there. And what it says "free" it means free from the mitzvot, as I will explain, with God's help, in the portion of Pinchas: it has to do with the gifts [to the Tabernacle] and the ten percents.

The “sin” of hitting was as follows: Chazal teach (Shemot Rabbah 21:9) that at the Splitting of the Sea the Torah says (Shemot 14:16) “And now lift up your staff and outstretch your hand”, this “lifting” is a language of removal, that is to say “Lift up and throw away your staff, outstretch your hand, without the staff.” For the people were murmuring that the staff was the cause for all the miracles through some means of sorcery within the staff, for the people had not seen miracles without this staff. Therefore HaShem instructed Moshe to throw away the staff and remove that doubt from their minds. So when it says (14:31) “Israel saw the Mighty Hand” meaning they saw the miracles that was done by hand, and not through the staff, and therefore “they believed in HaShem and Moshe His servant.” It would seem that until now they were children who did not trust them - they did not believe in HaShem and the prophecy of Moshe His servant because they had reason to assume the staff created miracles.
