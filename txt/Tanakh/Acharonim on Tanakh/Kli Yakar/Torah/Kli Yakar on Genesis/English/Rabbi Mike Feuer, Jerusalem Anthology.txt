to work the ground from where he had been taken – It is not for naught that the verse mentions “from where he had been taken.” I also found written in the midrash (Shachar Tov Tehillim 92) that the first man (Adam HaRishon) settled himself on Mount Moriah, and from where did they learn this? I further found in the words of our Sages (Chullin 60a) that Adam HaRishon offered a young bull with horns and hooves, and where did they find support in the Torah for this? It appears to me that the source for these statements is the verse “from where he had been taken.” That is to say, from the place about which it says “an altar of earth you shall make for Me…” (Shemot 20:21) As the Sages said, ‘the Holy One created him from the place of his atonement, if only that it be an atonement for him!’ (Bereshit Rabbah 14:8) This refers to Mount Moriah to which Gd sent him to work the ground, build an earthen altar from it and offer upon it an offering of atonement; he was taken from that earth and it is the gate through which he passed, as it gave him his thick, coarse substance through whose agency he fell into sin - as is explained above on the verse “…a tree which makes fruit.” (Bereshit 1:11) Therefore in the place which caused his sin, his atonement will be found because that place – that is, that earth – caused him to sin and therefore that earth is obligated to help him to attain atonement through working it into an altar upon which to offer a bull with horns and hooves. This is a correct explanation of the commandment ‘“an altar of earth you shall make for Me,’ because the damage will be fixed through that which caused the sin. Even according to the opinion that Gd gathered dust for the first man from the whole earth this is still the explanation, because the place about which it says “an altar of earth you shall make for Me” is the location of the foundation stone, from which the world was founded. Dust taken from the center of the world is like dust gathered from the whole earth. Through this the difficulty presented by the verse “…the land upon which you are lying to you I will give it and to your seed” is resolved. (Bereshit 28:13) Rashi explains the verse that Gd folded the entire land underneath Ya’akov. According to my explanation we do not have to say this, rather we can say that he lay down on the spot which is the navel of the world and its center - therefore it was as if he lay down on all the land in its entirety.

Verse 1



…and for this reason it did not say at the beginning of this vision, ‘and Gd appeared to him’ but rather only once he (Avraham) had entered the land, because then he was prepared to behold visions of the Divine Presence. Beforehand, when he was still outside the land, he only heard a voice speaking of things. This is because Gd did not appear to him until he came to the land, as is explained shortly. Therefore he called that place the ladder of Tzur (sulma shel tzur) as it says in the Yalkut on this portion (remez 62) that once Avraham arrived at the ladder of Tzur he said ‘let my portion be in this land.’ Who told the author of this midrash that Avraham arrived at the ladder of Tzur? He certainly meant Mount Moriah, because that was the location of the ladder which Yaakov saw standing in the house of Gd (Bet El). Via that ladder souls ascend and descend, and there is the bedrock from which the body is hewn as it says, “…look at the rock whence you were hewn...” (Isaiah 51:1) because from that rock, which is called the foundation stone, the world in general was founded. Also man, who is called a microcosm (olam katan), was fashioned from the place of that rock, which is the also the place of the ladder for the soul as stated. For this reason it says “go to you” (lech l’cha) here and at the binding of Yitzchak, and so too in the verse “…I will go to the mountain of myrrh…” (Shir HaShirim 4:6) and so too “…the rain is over, and gone (to itself – halach lo)” (ShirHaShirim 2:11) it returned to the place of its source, 'because a mist comes up from the land' (compare Bereshit 2:6 and Taanit 9b). The same construction is found in the verse “Now get up and cross (to yourselves) the brook of Zered…” (Devarim 2:13) that is, so too into the land of Israel. And also “I will go (to me) to the great ones…” (Jeremiah 5:5) because there is the dwelling place of the whole ones. This is true of all ‘to me, to him, to you, to them’ (li, lo, lecha, lahem) in the Bible that they should be interpreted so. Therefore Avraham understood from the phrase go you (to yourself – lech lecha) to go to the land of Canaan, even though it was not stated to which land he should head.

It seems to me from all this that one can say, that the Holy One gave the land to Avraham in order that he acquire there two types of benefit. The first is spiritual, and is acquired simply through seeing. The other is physical and is acquired through marking out its boundaries (see Baba Metzia 14b). The spiritual benefit is, that there is the place of the Sanctuary below aligned with the Holy Temple above. There the Lord made a place for His dwelling, and there “was His strengthen hidden.” (Habakuk 3:4) Anyone who gazes upon that holy place is immediately clothed in a spirit of purity and holiness and will see the supernal King  with his eyes. Sight alone is enough in order for one to acquire that perfection in the place which Avraham called “The Lord will see” (Bereshit 22:14), which can be read as will see (yireh) or will be seen (yeira’eh). Just as one comes there to see so to they come to be seen, because immediately upon arrival the Divine Presence sees him and he sees the face of the Divine Presence. In that moment, one becomes influenced and ennobled and cleaves to the radiance of the Divine Presence.  This is almost like the world to come, because there too the righteous sit and take pleasure in the radiance of His Presence. It is not every place in the land where one can merit to this perfection, but rather in the place which is called ‘The Lord sees,’ which is Mount Moriah and Bet El because above it is written “…until Beth El…To the place of the altar that he had made at first…” (Bereshit 13:3-4) and below (28:17) Rashi states that the Holy Temple came out to Bet El to meet him (Yaakov). The commentators explain that from that moment on those two places were connected, the place of the Holy Temple and Bet El, and became one. Therefore it was said here to Avram “Please raise your eyes and see, from the place where you are…” (Genesis 13:14) God indicated directly that this spiritual perfection which is acquired through sight will only be acquired by him from the place which he stood, which was Bet El. This is what is implied by the plain meaning of the verses “And he went on his journeys, from the south and until Beth el.” This is also what is meant by “to the land that I will show you,” (Bereshit 12:1) that I will show you there, for this reason you will see the King in His beauty with your own eyes.

Verse 2

And go (you) to the land of Moriah – It mentioned ‘go you’ meaning go to your essence, because from there the origin of human physicality was taken, from the place of which it is said “An altar of earth you shall make for Me…” (Shemot 20:21) as was explained in the portion of Lech Lecha (Bereshit 12:1). In the word Moriah, the yud hey appears superfluous, because it is said “I will go to the mountain of myrrh (mor)…” (Shir HaShirim 4:6) However, there is the place of the foundation stone, from which two worlds created with the letters yud hey were founded, because the gate of heaven is there, and there the union between the Holy One and Israel is made complete, like the cleaving of a man to his wife between whom the name yud hey mediates, and His beloved said fifteen (songs of praise) parallel to the fifteen (yud hey) steps which came up from the Court of Women. These letters are also a sign of the Holy Temple which would be built there after the fifteen generations from Avraham to Shlomo.
Upon one of the mountains which I will say to you – It says this because the Holy One had not revealed the place where the Holy Temple was to built to any creature, as will be explained below in the portion of Re’eh (Devarim 12:4). Except that Avraham knew this secret and that is why he called the place HaShem yireh (Gd will see) as I will explain on that verse. Another explanation of the phrase ‘which I will say to you’ is that in the future the word of Gd would come to the prophets from there, as it says “…and I will speak with you from atop the ark cover…” (Shemot 25:22) There are those who say that this phrase is referring to Gd’s statement ‘and bring him up to a whole offering.’ It doesn’t say ‘bring him up as’ but rather bring him up to. That is to say, in order to offer a different offering which I will say to you – who will be the offering? Either your son or some other thing.

Verse 11

And he arrived at the place and lodged there because the sun had set. Our Sages said (Chullin 91b) that this was Mount Moriah, as it says about it “…and he saw the place from afar.” (Bereshit 22:4) That place was called ‘the place’ without any specific name. Every place has an identifying name, derived from the name of its owner or its nature, but in this it was separate from all other places – the essence and name of this place was hidden as I explained above in the portion of Vayera (22:14). Therefore it is called simply ‘the place,’ because it has not yet received the name which will distinguish it from all other places.
Another reason why it is called simply ‘the place,’ is because this is the place of the world. This is both because the foundation stone, from which the world was founded, is located there, and that even now the whole world rests on it because from there the Divine abundance pours out to the world. Ya’akov sensed that this would be the place of the Holy Temple when he saw that the sun set upon him before its proper time, because this holy place dims the sphere of the sun and does not require the sun. On the contrary  - the sun needs it, as the Sages taught ‘R’ Avin said, we find that one who wants to make windows makes them wide on the inside and narrow on the outside in order to draw in the light from outside. But the windows of the Holy Temple were wide on the outside and narrow within – why? In order that the light would go out from the Temple and illuminate the world, as it says “…and the earth shone from His glory,” (Yechezkiel 43:2) and it is written “As a Throne of Glory, exalted from the beginning, so is the place of our Sanctuary.” (Yirmiyahu 17:12) See the version of this midrash in Yalkut parshat Tetzaveh 378. This is a proof that the sun does not light the Holy Temple, therefore the light of the sun dimmed immediately upon reaching this holy place, “…and it shall come to pass that at eventide it shall be light,” (Zechariah 14:7) because Gd shined the supernal light from this holy place until He appeared to Yaakov in a vision that night.
There is another hint in what it says in the midrash Yalkut Shimoni 118, that the sun set two hours before its time. Why precisely two hours? There is a hint in this about the future, that so too will Israel’s sun set two years before its time. As Rashi explained in the Torah portion of Va'etchanan (Devarim 4:25) Gd brought the exile two years early, as its says “And the Lord hastened with the evil…” (Daniel 9:14) If this is so, then the Holy Temple which will be built in this place is destined to be destroyed two years before its sun has set. Therefore this hint came to Yaakov through the early setting of the sun, that there would be a sign in his hand that in the future the Holy Temple would be destroyed two years early. Therefore “…and he took some of the stones of the place and placed [them] at his head…” (Bereshit 28:11) They said in the midrash, brought by the Rama in Orach Chaim 555:2, that the pious and holy ones were accustomed to place a stone under their heads when they laid down on the night of Tisha B’Av. He said that they have a support from this verse “…and he took some of the stones…” because Yaakov saw the destruction. And who told the writer of this midrash that Yaakov saw the destruction? Certainly they learned this from the fact that the sun set two hours early, as I said.
and he took some of the stones of the place and placed them at his head  - After it was known to him that this place would be the House of Gd which dims the sphere of the sun, therefor he took some of the stones of the place and set them as a guard to his head in order to show how he cherished their sanctity as it says “For Your servants desired its stones…” (Tehillim 102:15) He took twelve stones parallel to the twelve tribes as it says in the midrash (Bereshit Raba 68:11) that the stones argued, each one saying ‘let the righteous one rest his head on me!’ until they became one stone. This was a hint for the future as the writer of the Guide to the Perplexed wrote, that this is why the Holy One hid this place which would be the location of the Holy Temple and the King’s palace – in order that there not be argument between the tribes, each desiring that holy place to be theirs. Also for the sake of peace, as it says “But only to the place which the Lord your God shall choose from all your tribes…” (Devarim 12:5) And it is written “But only in the place the Lord will choose in one of your tribes…” (Devarim 12:14) How is this? When David purchased the threshing floor from Aravna the Yevusi, he collected the money from all of the tribes, as Rashi explains there (see Shmuel II 24:24). If this is so, then the argument between the stones which ended in their becoming one stone was sign for the future, that so too will be the argument between the crown jewels, the twelve tribes of Gd, that each tribe will say let the righteous One of the world rest His head upon me, referring to the Holy Temple as it says “As a Throne of Glory, exalted from the beginning, so is the place of our Sanctuary.” (Yirmiyahu 17:12) In the end they were made as one stone when David collected the gold from all of them. About this stone it is said regarding the building of the Second Temple “Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you sink to a plain! He will bring out the stone of the main architect, with shouts of grace, grace to it.” (Zechariah 4:7) When it says that He will bring out the stone of the main architect (even rosha) it means the stone which was at the head (rosh) of Yaakov. Bring it out to build the foundation for the Palace of Gd. Yaakov made a bed from it to lie upon in order that it be a sign that this will be 'the bed which is to Shlomo' (Song of Songs 3:7) – the king to whom peace belongs, as Rashi explained in Shir HaShirim on the verse “Behold the bed of Shlomo…”
