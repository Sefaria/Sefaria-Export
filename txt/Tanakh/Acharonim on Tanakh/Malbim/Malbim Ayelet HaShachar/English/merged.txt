Malbim Ayelet HaShachar



Klal 1

<small>These are the laws and the rules, the measurements and the foundations, the statutes and the directions that the sages of the <i>Mishnah</i> received, the traditions of the laws of the Holy Tongue, said to the sons of Israel. The words of the LORD are pure words, guarded and counted, as silver tried in a crucible on the earth, refined seven times<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 12:7.</i>; weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 40:12.</i>. He built a fortified wall for the Torah, a bolt and doors around the wall; the name of the LORD is a strong tower<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 18:10.</i>, the Holy Temple of the King. All glorious is the king's daughter within the palace<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 45:14.</i>; The law of the LORD is perfect<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 19:8.</i>. The tradition and the Oral Torah that was inherited from Sinai - Oral Torah upon the Written Torah it was established; on many waters which depend on rules of logic and phraseology it dwells. The revealed and the hidden, the clarified and the revealed, the Torah and the commandment, the written and the mystical, the reading and the tradition, the expressions and the words, the Written Law and the Oral Law, all of these are connected together, and together they will be complete. The literal meaning and the homiletically interpreted meaning converge and never diverge; none shall want her mate<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 34:16.</i>. And on the Tablets of Testimony which were written by the finger of the Living God upon them and upon them all of the words which the LORD spoke through Moses, from this and from that they were written. And they read in the book, in the Law of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Nehemiah 8:8.</i>. All of the laws and judgements, the generalities and particulars that Moses received from Sinai and passed down generation after generation to the elders, prophets, holy ministers, and through these words the LORD formed a covenant with Israel, all given from one Shepherd to one receiver, one God gave them; one leader uttered them from the mouth of the Master of all creation, blessed be He; also make your ears like auricles and acquire for yourself an understanding heart<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Babylonian Talmud Hagigah 3b.</i> and eyes to see and ears to hear. And perceive with your eyes and with your ears and acquire for yourself an understanding heart and eyes to see and ears to hear. And perceive with your eyes and with your ears; hear and your heart will discern to know and to understand; delve and delve into it, for all is in it; grow old and worn with it; do not budge from it<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Ethics of the Fathers 5:21.</i>.</small><br>The sages of blessed memory agree with the linguists that there is no root in the Holy Tongue that has more than three letters. And they say that four-letter roots are composed of two or three words, and that some of them are derived from other languages.<br><br><i>All words in the Hebrew language are composed of at least one root, which contains the essence of the word’s meaning. Roots are characterized by a sequence of consonants called “radicals”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">N. Bronznick and L. Uveeler, Ha-Yesod Fundamentals of Hebrew, Feldheim Publishers, 1998.</i>.</i>

Klal 2

And according to the great linguists, light shall shine upon their ways<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Job 22:28.</i>, there are irregular verbs which only have a two-letter root. And they say that the roots which consist of one of the vowel letters אהו"י- hollow, quiescent, defective, and geminate – all of these have only two-letter roots.<br><br><i>A regular verb in Hebrew has a three-letter root. But many verbs in Hebrew are irregular, having only two-letter roots. Hollow verbs are verbs in which the second radical is either the letter </i>י<i> or the letter </i>ו<i>. Quiescent verbs are verbs in which one of their radicals loses its vocalization in one tense or another. Defective verbs are verbs that lose a radical in one tense or another. And geminate verbs are verbs that have identical second and third radicals<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">N. Bronznick and L. Uveeler, Ha-Yesod Fundamentals of Hebrew, Feldheim Publishers, 1998.</i>.</i>

Klal 3

“But the path of the righteous is as the light of dawn, that shines more and more”, between the scholars of the ancient tongue, “unto the perfect day”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 4:18.</i>. As Rabbi Solomon Pappenheim and all of the interpreters of the language explain and clarify, all of the language is built from roots of two letters and also from one letter.
And the letters <b>האמנ"תיו</b> that can be found between the letters of a root – before, after, or in the middle – they are affixes, and most roots consist of two words.<br><br><i>According to Rule 3, even roots with three letters can be further decomposed into roots with two letters and one letter. For example, the root בצק (dough) is composed of the two two-letter roots בא and צק, since dough בא בתכונת היציקה (comes with the quality of pouring/casting)<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Kedoshim 54.</i>.</i>

Klal 4

And there are many roots that start with the letter מ, where the important part of the root follows, as <b>מדנים</b> (quarrel) comes from דין (judgement), <b>ממזר</b> (bastard) comes from זר (foreign), <b>ממארת</b> (malignant) has the root <b>ארה</b> (curse). And moreover, <b>מרוח אשך</b> (stones crushed) is from רוח (spirit), <b>מֵאֵן</b> (disagree) is from אין (not), <b>מורך</b> (faintness) is from רכך (soften), etc.
And moreover with nouns where the ת is in the root, it is usually added, as <b>תהום</b> (deep) is from המה,<br><b>תכן</b> (establish) is from כן, etc.
And in many roots, the מ that is in the end is added: <b>צלמון</b> (image) and <b>חרום</b>(maimed), etc.
And in many roots, the נ that is in the middle is added:<br><b>איש</b> (man) becomes <b>אנוש</b>,<br><b>בת</b> (daughter) becomes <b>בנה</b>.
And we find names that have four letters such that the final letter is added, as<b>גבעול</b> (stalk) comes fromגבע (small hill), <b>גנזך</b> (archive) comes from גנז (to store), etc. In particular, ר is found added also at the beginning and in the middle of four letters – <b>רטפש</b> (tender), <b>שרביט</b> (sceptre), <b>שרעיף</b>, <b>שקערורות</b> (hollow streaks).

Klal 5

The letter ת that is added to the beginning of a word to indicate that it is a noun usually teaches about the quantity or the quality. When the noun that has in it a sign that it is a noun and the extra letter נ is added (like <b>תופיני</b>), it sometimes comes to diminish the theme. And the sages of blessed memory observe in the word תופיני (broken pieces)<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:14.</i> two meanings.
And we find that the letter נ when it is added to the noun expands the theme – <b>שבתון</b> (sabbatical), <b>עצבון</b> (sorrow), according to the sages of blessed memory.
When the second and third radicals repeat, it teaches that the matter is strengthened, like <b>ירקרק</b> (greenish) and <b>אדמדם</b> (reddish).<br><br><i>Rabbi Yehuda interprets תופיני to mean they shall be baked when they are still beautiful, while Rabbi Yossi interprets תופיני to mean they should be baked extensively, i.e., more than once<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Babylonian Talmud Menachot 50b.</i>.</i>

Klal 6

The letter <b>מ</b> that is added to the beginning of nouns - like <b>משכן, מושב, מקדש, מרכב, משכב, מקום</b> - indicates a special place for a certain matter. And therefore, they explain when it is written, חוץ למחנה מושבו (without the camp shall his dwelling be)<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:46.</i>, that מושבו (his dwelling) is unclean, since it did not say שבתו. And when it is written לכל מראה עיני הכהן (as far as appears to the priest)<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:12.</i>, but it does not say לכל ראות, it teaches not to rule according to the perceiver, but rather according to the objective appearance.
And moreover, the letter <b>מ</b> indicates the instrument with which the action is performed, like <b>משקל, מקטר, מבטח, מבצר</b>. It means to say the object which is made for weighing, a scale (<b>משקל</b>), or for burning incense (<b>מקטר</b>). And this is what distinguishes them from the nouns <b>שקל, קדש, קיטר, ביטחון, בצרון</b>, which indicate the thing itself. And this is the difference between <b>מכר</b> and <b>ממכר</b> (merchandise); the noun ממכר also includes a gift. And moreover, between <b>מקנה</b> and <b>קנין</b> (acquisition); the noun מקנה emphasizes the action of acquisition, while the noun קנין is a noun representing the abstraction of acquisition, without focusing on the action.

Klal 7

And the declensions of the nouns change until there is no end. And there are distinctions between them in many ways.
From this perspective, we can be content that the noun <b>שְׁבֻעַיִם</b>(two weeks)<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 12:5.</i> is likely from the number שבע (seven) and they interpret it as <i>שבעה כפלים</i> (double seven), which equals ארבעתים (fourteen). And there is also שבוע (week) in feminine, which is written <b>שבועות</b>.

Klal 8

There are many verbs that are used sometimes at the beginning of an action and sometimes in its continuation (like <b>קם, עמד, שכב, חיה, היה</b>):
And therefore, when it repeats ילבש על בשרו... יהיו על בשרו (his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:3.</i>….he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:4.</i>); when it says יהיו (he shall have), it is talking about the continuation of the action and ילבש (shall he put upon) comes in the beginning of dressing. And when it repeats כל מום לא יהיה בו (there shall be no blemish therein)<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 22:21.</i>, it means the formation of a blemish in its beginning, etc.

Klal 9

It is impossible for verbs which have a continuous and proceeding action to come in imperative form with the word יהיה (will be); as for <b>יצמח, יגדל, יפרה</b> – it will not say יהיה צָמֵח or יהיה גָדֵל, but rather say יהיה גָדול (it will be great) - which establishes that it is already absolutely great.
And from this, they learn that when it is written ראשו יהיה פרוע (the hair of his head shall go loose)<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:45.</i>, it does not mean growth of hair, but rather it is talking about revealing the looseness and the hair.

Klal 10

There are verbs which teach that the subject is prepared to do or that the action is prepared to be done:
<b>והקטיר (</b>And the priest shall bring it to the altar, and pinch off its head, and <b>make it smoke</b> on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be drained out on the side of the altar<b>)<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:15.</i> -</b> that it will be proper to make it smoke.
<b>והשורף</b> (<b>And he that burns</b> them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he may come into the camp)<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:28.</i> - that it is prepared to burn.
<b>יאכלנה</b> (Every male among the children of Aaron <b>may eat of it</b>, as a due for ever throughout your generations, from the offerings of the LORD made by fire; whatsoever touches them shall be holy)<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:11.</i> - proper for eating.
<b>כהן המקריב</b> (And every meal-offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is dressed in the stewing-pan, and on the griddle, shall be <b>the priest's that offers it</b>)<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:9.</i> – that he is prepared for this.
<b>וקצרתם</b> (Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When you are come into the land which I give to you, and <b>shall reap</b> the harvest thereof, then you shall bring the sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest to the priest)<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 23:10.</i> – when you will want to reap.
<b>ונמכר</b> (after that <b>he is sold</b> he may be redeemed; one of his brethren may redeem him)<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 25:48.</i> – when he is ready to be sold.
<b>והעמידו</b> (But if he be too poor for your valuation, then <b>he shall be set</b> before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the means of him that vowed shall the priest value him)<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 27:8.</i> – that he shall be able to be set.

Klal 11

Or it will use the verb to teach about the measure, as when it is written:
האוכל מנבלתה (And he that eats of the carcass of it)<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 11:40.</i> – at least the minimum amount to be considered eating.
האוכל בבית והשוכב (And he that lies in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eats in the house shall wash his clothes)<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:47.</i> – at least the minimum amount.
אשר יזה מדמה (and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof)<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:20.</i> – that it will be proper for sprinkling.
And moreover, when it is written בכל קדש לא תגע (she shall touch no hallowed thing)<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 12:4.</i>, it is a warning about eating and it uses the word תגע (touch) to say that the law concerning touching is like the law concerning eating, that both are prohibited to an unclean person.
And moreover, לתנופה לכפר (to be waved, to make atonement for him)<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:21.</i> – if one failed to perform the ritual of waving, the verse ascribes to him a status as if it does not atone; nevertheless, it does atone.

Klal 12

There are perfect tense verbs and imperfect tense verbs. And it is possible to determine with many verbs whether they are perfect or imperfect. And with many commandments, the Torah reveals that a verb is in imperfect tense by repeating the infinitive with the verb, like <b>עזב תעזב, הקם הקים, שלח תשלח</b> – so it means that it will be an imperfect tense verb, which can even be done several times (as will be explained later in rule 38).
And with many commandments, we can know through logic that it is an imperfect tense verb likeאם כסף תלוה (If you lend money)<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 22:24.</i>, וכתבתם על מזוזות (And you shall write them upon the door-posts)<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 11:20.</i>. And when it is written וכסהו (and cover it with dust)<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 17:13.</i>, it is in perfect tense and it means that it is sufficient to cover it only one time. And this is why it is written וכסהו and not ויכסהו (because of rule 44 that is explained later). And when it is written וכסהו with a pronoun, it is clarified later in rule 151.<br><br><i>Unlike most modern languages, verbs in the Biblical Hebrew have only two tenses, perfect and imperfect. Perfect tense is used to express a completed action, while imperfect tense is used to express an incomplete action.</i>

Klal 13

There are many verbs that are designated for a special limb or special noun, and with these verbs we do not need to mention the limb or noun that performs the action of the verb, unless it comes to be precise.
Like<b>וילך ברגליו</b> (and he walked with his feet), <b>וישמע באזניו</b> (and he heard with his ears), <b>וירא בעיניו</b> (and he saw with his eyes) - the noun is superfluous. And it means to say that he walks with his feet and not on a horse, or that he himself hears and sees, not through others.
לבטא בשפתים (swear clearly with his lips)<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:4.</i> - to exclude swearing in his heart.
לא תגיע ידו (if his means suffice not)<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:7.</i> – his own means.
וסמך ידו (And he shall lay his hand)<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:4.</i> - not through an envoy.
במלח תמלח (shall you season with salt)<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 2:13.</i> – not to salt in salt water.<br><br><i>According to the Malbim, there are no truly superfluous words in the Written Torah (Rule 238). Every word in the Torah is there for a reason. Therefore, if the Torah says “he heard with his ears”, there must be a reason why the Torah mentioned the seemingly superfluous “with his ears”. In such an instance, it would be to exclude the possibility that he heard through others.</i>

Klal 14

And there is a difference between when it says ראה בעיניו (see with his eyes) – it is precise in that it means <i>with his own eyes</i>, as it appears to him – and when it says בעיניו (with his eyes) without the verb ראה (see), as in חכם בעיניו (wise in his eyes) - which means that it seems to him that he is such, but he is not.

Klal 15

Verbs that are designated to a specific limb – like <b>ולקח ונתן</b> (take/give) to the hand, <b>דרך רמס הלך</b> (walk on/trample/walk) to the foot, <b>פנה</b> (turn) to countenance - with all of these, the verb must act with that limb. And this explains why the special verbs (like <b>חפן קמץ כרע</b>) are derived from the name of the limb in which the verb acts.
But for verbs that teach about the action of a certain thing, like <b>זרק שפך חלץ כסה</b>, it is not resolved as to what performs the action and we always learn this from the context and from the verb that is next to it.<br><br><i>For example, the verb </i>כרע<i>, which means kneel, is derived from the noun </i>כרע<i>, which means knee, as one kneels with one’s knee. And the verb </i>קמץ<i>, which means grasp a handful of something, is derived from the noun </i>קמץ<i>, which means handful. And the verb </i>חפן<i>, which means to take a handful, is derived from the noun </i>חפן<i>, which means handful.</i>

Klal 16

There are verbs which deal with what a man is commanded to do, even that which he does not do himself. And this applies to all of the work for which the way to do it is through laborers, like building houses, working in the fields, digging holes, etc. And when mentioning these verbs in general business, like general planting (to exclude planting one tree, etc.), it will also be done by means of other people.
And moreover, the verb <b>עשה</b> applies whether he does it himself or it is done through his orders. And there is a difference in this between whether it says in singular לא תעשה לך or it says in plural לא תעשו לכם; when in plural, those who participate in an action will only be by means of other people.

Klal 17

The verbs that are said in plural imperative – we understand them according to their context.
If the way of doing is as a group – it means that it is referring to the public, like ועשו לי מקדש (And let them make Me a sanctuary)<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 25:8.</i> or והבאתם את עומר (you shall bring the sheaf)<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 23:10.</i>.
And those for which the way to do them is for every individual to do it for himself – it is interpreted that it means to say each and every individual; like וכי תזבחו זבח שלמים (And when you offer a sacrifice of peace-offerings)<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 19:5.</i> and ועשו להם ציצית (and bid them that they make them throughout their generations fringes)<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 15:38.</i>.
And from this, there is a disagreement between Rabbi Yehuda and the sages about the verb ונטעתם (and shall have planted)<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 19:23.</i> that is with respect to fruits from the first three years of a tree's life<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Babylonian Talmud Pesachim 23a.</i>.

Klal 18

The commandments that warn the general public and the individuals are precise in that the general public and courts are designated to watch over individuals.
And the commandments that are spoken to the general public in singular are told to the court; like וספרת לך (And you shall number)<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 25:8.</i>. And moreover, it will also come in matters that include the people as a whole, meaning the whole community together.
And see more later in Rule 161 and Rule 163.

Klal 19

There is a difference between the active and passive voice of a verb: The active voice focuses on the subject. And the passive voice focuses on the action being performed, not on the subject, and even that the subject does not perform its action, only that the action is done on its own:
יְמצה (shall squeeze) - intentionally, יִמָצֶה (shall be drained) – on its own.
כנגע ראיתי (I perceived it to be as it were a plague) - intentionally; כנגע נראה לי (There seems to me to be as it were a plague in the house)<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:35.</i> – on its own, accidentally.

Klal 20

And from this, there are several distinctions with respect to the conjugation of the verb and its meaning:
<b>ישרוף</b> (burn) in simple active conjugation – in the moment when he is occupied with burning. <b>יִשָרף</b> (burn) in simple passive conjugation – precisely when the object is burned.
<b>אכל</b> (eat) in simple active conjugation – precisely the size of an olive (or larger), since less than this is not called אכילה with respect to the subject, only טעימה (tasting). <b>יֵאָכל</b> (eat) in simple passive conjugation – anything that is eaten, since it is called אכילה with respect to the object.
<b>וראהו הכהן</b> (and the priest shall look)<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:3.</i> – it is strict about how it will be seen, and it needs to be seen as one. <b>וביום הֵראות</b> (But whensoever raw flesh appears in him)<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:14.</i> – it is only strict in that it is seen, even if it is not seen as one.

Klal 21

And also, there is a distinction between whether it has an active voice conjugation or a passive voice conjugation: יֵאָכל (be eaten), in passive voice, means that one is obligated not to feed others forbidden food. And moreover, it comes to prohibit for benefit, and it means to say <i>even if it is eaten by him</i>. יעשה מלאכה בהם (And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, <b>wherewith any work is done</b>, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the evening; then shall it be clean)<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 11:32.</i> – and not where the work is done with others.

Klal 22

And also, imperatives in passive voice teach that one is under no circumstances exempt; when commanding the subject in active voice, he will sometimes be exempt if he has no control over the situation or if he is in a situation that makes him exempt. This is not true when something is commanded to be done and it does not focus on the subject and its context.
As they interpret – <b>תיעשה</b> (shall be made) – even on Sabbath and when unclean. <b>ישלם</b>(he will pay) - knowingly, <b>ישולם</b> (it will be paid) - against his will, etc.

Klal 23

And all verbs for which it is impossible for them to be without a subject – the one language will be in active and passive, <b>מלוה לוה</b>(to lend/to borrow), <b>מכה מוכה</b> (to hit/to be hit), <b>רוצח נרצח</b> (to murder/to be murdered). And if the language is unusual between them – it is depicted that one is without its associate: As with <b>נותן לוקח</b> (give/take) - it is depicted as taking without necessarily giving.
And moreover, קונה מוכר (sell/acquire) is depicted as acquiring without necessarily being sold. And this is the difference between the verb <b>כרה</b> (buy) and the verb <b>קנה</b> (acquire): <b>כרה</b> is only from the seller with a price. And <b>קנה</b> can be through any manner - קונה שמים וארץ (Maker of heaven and earth)<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 14:19.</i>. אשת המת קניתי (the wife of the dead)<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Ruth 4:5.</i>.

Klal 24

There is a difference between <b>הנפעל</b> (simple passive) and <b>הבינוני פעול</b> (passive participle): <b>הנפעל</b> indicates that the action occurs in a limited time, whereas <b>הבינוני פעול</b> belongs with the nouns, not with the verbs (as the opinion of the ancients was that the infinitive, the active participle, and the passive participle enter into “the gate of the nouns”), and only indicates that the action is found in the participle itself, not that it applies in a limited time.
<i>Rava</i> uses this to prove that when it is written ונעלם ממנו (it being hidden from him that he is unclean)<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:2.</i> and not והיא עלומה ממנו, it is necessary that it was known to him in the beginning that he was unclean; that with this, the hiddenness applies in a limited time. And even though <i>Abaye</i> disputes his <i>Rava’s</i> words from where it is written ונעלמה מעיני כל חי (Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living)<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Job 28:21.</i> – there is a difference in this between a passive verb which indicates that some other entity performed the action (that then the action applies from the time that the other entity started the action) and a passive verb which does not have any other entity performing the action (that then the changing must apply on its own - that at first he knows and afterwards it is hidden from him).<br><br><i>Leviticus 5:2 says,</i>או נפש אשר תגע בכל דבר טמא או בנבלת חיה טמאה או בנבלת בהמה טמאה או בנבלת שרץ טמא ונעלם ממנו והוא טמא ואשם<i> (or if any one touch any unclean thing, whether it be the carcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean swarming things, and be guilty, it being hidden from him that he is unclean), using </i>ונעלם ממנו<i> for “it being hidden from him”. Rava uses these words to argue that since </i>ונעלם<i> is a passive verb, it is necessary that it was known to him in the beginning that he was unclean; that with this, the hiddenness applies in a limited time.</i><br><br><i>Then Abaye uses the following verse to dispute Rava’s argument: Job 28:20-21 says,</i>והחכמה מאין תבוא ואי זה מקום בינה. ונעלמה מעיני כל חי ומעוף השמים נסתרה<i> (Whence then comes wisdom? And where is the place of understanding? Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air), using ונעלמה מעיני כל חי for “it is hid from the eyes of all living”. Abaye’s claim is that the hiddenness from all living in this verse does not apply in a limited time, even though it uses the passive verb ונעלמה. However, this verse is different than Leviticus 5:2 in that in this verse, the passive verb ונעלמה (hid) indicates that some other entity performed the action, namely God, as God hides wisdom and understanding from the eyes of all living, while in Leviticus 5:2, the passive verb </i>ונעלם<i> (hidden) does not have some other entity performing the action of hiding. Hence, the two cases are fundamentally different, so according to the Malbim, Abaye has not disproven Rava’s claim<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 309.</i>.</i>

Klal 25

<b>בנין הכבד</b> (intensive conjugation) sometimes informs of the opposite of the meaning of the verb, as <b>ודִשנו</b> את המזבח (And they shall take away the ashes from the altar)<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 4:13.</i>.
And also it informs of the persistence of the action - <b>שׁוֹבֵר מְשׁבֵּר, מוֹלִיד מְיַלֵּד</b> – according to Rabbi Solomon Yitzchaki (<i>Rashi</i>).<br><br><i>The word <b>ודִשנו</b> means “fertilize”, but in Numbers 4:13, </i><b>ודִשנו</b> את המזבח<i> means “take away”.</i>

Klal 26

And the ancient linguists called the conjugations <b>פֻּעַל</b> and <b>הָפְעַל</b><br>"בנינים שלא נזכר שם פועלם" (conjugations in which the subject is not mentioned), because these conjugations do not always indicate the subject, only the action alone, without focusing on the subject. And moreover, this is the understanding of the sages of blessed memory.<br><br><i>Linguists today call</i> <b>פֻּעַל</b> <i>conjugation “passive voice intensive”, while they call</i> <b>הָפְעַל</b> <i>conjugation “passive voice causative”.</i>

Klal 27

And the word <b>הוֹדַע</b> (known) in או <b>הוֹדַע</b> אליו חטאתו (if his sin, which he has sinned, be known to him)<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:28.</i> is composed of three verb conjugations:
When there is a חולם vowel <b>וֹ</b> after the ה, it indicates that it is in the active voice causative conjugation, like<b>הוֹרִיד</b> (to lower) and <b>הוֹשִיב</b> (to seat).
And the פתח vowel under the ד indicates that it is in the passive voice causative conjugation, like <b>הוּרַד</b> (to be lowered) and <b>הוּשַב</b> (to be seated).
And when the preposition <b>אל</b> comes afterwards – it only comes in reflexive conjugation like <b>בהתודע</b> יוסף אל אחיו (Joseph made himself known to his brethren)<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 45:1.</i> (but after the verb ידעin causative conjugation form, active or passive, it always uses the prefix <b>ל</b>) – it indicates that it is in reflexive conjugation, which is composed of active and passive voice causative conjugation.
And the sages of blessed memory interpret in this word <b>הוֹדַע</b> the foreignness of all of the meanings that are within it. Active voice causative conjugation is indicative of the action of the subject, passive voice causative conjugation is indicative of no subject, and reflexive conjugation is indicative of the action on itself.

Klal 28

And moreover,<b>בנין התפעל</b> (reflexive conjugation) teaches about three things:
1) that one performs the action on itself.
2) about performing a similar action.
3) about the persistence of the action.
And the sages of blessed memory interpret these three things about the word והתגלח (then he shall be shaven)<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:33.</i> (instead of וגלחו). And all of this is according to Rule 212 explained below.<br><br><i>Leviticus 13:33 says, </i>והתגלח ואת הנתק לא יגלח והסגיר הכהן את הנתק שבעת ימים שנית<i> (then he shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up him that has the scall seven days more), using the word </i>והתגלח<i> for “then he shall be shaven”. The sages interpret this word to mean that:</i><br><br><i>He shaves himself.</i><br><br><i>It does not have to be with a razor. It just has to look as if he shaved with a razor.</i><br><br><i>That he is to always shave, even in times when he might think he does not have to shave, like when he takes a vow to become a </i>נזיר<i> (a religious ascetic)<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Tazria 131.</i>.</i>

Klal 29

The conjugation <b>הָפְעַל</b> (passive voice causative) comes in two ways: when the ה has a קמץ vowel underneath it, like <b>הָפְקַד</b> (punished), and when the ה has a שורק vowel underneath it, like <b>הֻמְלַחְתְּ</b> (become salty).
And there is a difference between them: The verb with a שורק teaches about the action of the subject. And the verb with a קמץ teaches that it is done on its own or it indicates the continuation of the action which does not focus on the subject anymore.

Klal 30

According to the <i>Radak</i> (Rabbi David Kimhi), verbs with four letters, like<b>בונן קומם שובב</b>, are pronounced with a צירי (long-a sound, as in “pay”) when they come without a repeated letter, and are pronounced with a פתח (short-a sound, as in “cat”) when they come with a repeated letter. And this is the opinion of Rabbi Elia Levita. And according to Rabbi Abraham ben Meir Ibn Ezra, regardless of whether they come with or without a repeated letter, the פתח and צירי are distinguished between active and passive intensive conjugation in that when they are in active intensive conjugation, they both will have a צירי, and when they are in passive intensive conjugation, they both will have a פתח.
And just as the Medieval commentators disagree about this, there is a similar disagreement between the sages of the <i>Talmud</i> about the verb <b>תעוננו</b>, whether its root is <b>עון</b> or <b>עונן</b>.

Klal 31

According to the <i>Radak</i>, any root in which the first radical is the letter י is defective and quiescent (see Rule 2). And he considers the root <b>יקף</b> (to round) to be defective. And Rabbi Elia Levita disagrees with him and writes that its root is <b>נקף</b>; he holds that it would only be defective if the second radical were the letter צ. And moreover Rava and Rav Ashi disagree about this in <i>Babylonian Talmud Makkot 20b</i> with respect to the prohibition of rounding one’s temples<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 19:27.</i>. The <i>Radak</i> holds the opinion of Rava, while Rabbi Elia Levita holds the opinion of Rav Ashi.

Klal 32

The infinitive of a simple passive voice verb will not be associated with the word את. And when it is written ביום המשח אותו (in the day when he is annointed)<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:13.</i>, there is a homiletical interpretation. And moreover, whenever the word את comes after a verb in reflexive conjugation, the linguists are perplexed, while the sages of blessed memory will give a homiletical interpretation.<br><br><i>Throughout Ayelet Hashachar, the Malbim gives rules as to how the Torah is supposed to be written, but also often gives examples of these rules being broken. And whenever these rules are broken, the Malbim will say that the sages of blessed memory give a דרוש (homiletical interpretation). Rule 32 is the first example of this in Ayelet Hashachar.</i><br><br><i>Leviticus 6:13 says,</i> זה קרבן אהרן ובניו אשר יקריבו ליהוה ביום המשח אתו עשירת האפה סלת מנחה תמיד מחציתה בבקר ומחציתה בערב <i>(This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed: the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half thereof in the evening), where המשח (he is anointed) is associated with the word אותו, contradicting Rule 32. The homiletical interpretation is that the word אותו is there to teach that two high priests may not be anointed together<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Tzav 41.</i>.</i>

Klal 33

After a transitive verb comes the word את, not the prefix letter מ. And when it is written החתים בשרו מזובו (his flesh be stopped from his issue)<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 15:3.</i>, there is a homiletical interpretation.<br><br><i>A </I>פועל יוצא<i> (transitive verb) is a verb that acts on an object. An intransitive verb is a verb that does not act on an object.</i><br><br><i>When Leviticus 15:3 says, </i>וזאת תהיה טמאתו בזובו רר בשרו את זובו או החתים בשרו מזובו טמאתו הוא<i> (And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his uncleanness), it uses the prefix letter </i>מ<i> before “his issue” in </i>החתים בשרו מזובו <i>(his flesh be stopped from his issue) instead of the word </i>את<i>, contradicting Rule 33. The homiletical interpretation is that </i>בשרו<i> (his flesh) is the subject and reason for it being stopped from his issue, and nothing else<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Metzora 122.</i>.</i>

Klal 34

And there is a difference betweeen whether a geminate verb contains all of the letters in its root or if its middle letter becomes swallowed with a דגש (diacritic dot), like <b>יחל יחלל. יסב יסובב. צמת צמיתות. כרת כריתות</b>, etc. Whenever the last letter is repeated, it teaches about the advantage of the action or its repetition.<br><br><i>Leviticus 22:2 says,</i> דבר אל אהרן ואל בניו וינזרו מקדשי בני ישראל ולא יחללו את שם קדשי אשר הם מקדשים לי אני יהוה <i>(Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, which they hallow unto Me, and that they profane not My holy name: I am the LORD), using the word יחללו for “profane”. The last letter of יחל is repeated, so it means several desecrations<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Emor 65.</i>.</i><br><br><i>Leviticus 25:23 says,</i> והארץ לא תמכר לצמתת כי לי הארץ כי גרים ותושבים אתם עמדי <i>(And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is Mine; for you are strangers and settlers with Me), using the word לצמתת for “in perpetuity”. The last letter of צמת is repeated, so it is interpreted to include that which is given as a gift<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Behar 59.</i>.</i>

Klal 35

And there is a difference between the verb<b>כֵהָה</b> (the plague be dim)<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:56.</i> and the noun <b>כֵהֶה</b> (darkness): The noun teaches that it is dimmed absolutely, while the verb teaches that it is swayed towards the action and it means to say that it is dimmed slightly.
And moreover, when it is written זאת תורת היולדת (This is the law for her that bears)<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 12:7.</i> (as an active participle), it is implied that she is still involved in childbirth; this is the difference between the subject and the adjective <b>יולדה</b>, which teaches that she was found in this state long ago. And they learn from this that she gives birth to many newborns.
And moreover, there is a difference between <b>רבוע</b> (square) – that it is an adjective which indicates that it is square and <b>מרובע</b> (square) – that it teaches about the position that is made in the act of mating. And this is what the sages of blessed memory mean when they say: <b>מי כתיב מרובע? רבוע כתיב</b> (Is it written <b>מרובע</b>? It is written <b>רבוע</b>)<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Babylonian Talmud Zevachim 62b.</i>.

Klal 36

For every past or future tense verb – a direct object can be derived from it, and when the verb is mentioned, it is not necessary to mention the noun. And any place where the direct object is added onto the verb, like <b>יקריב קרבן</b> (bring a sacrifice) or <b>ידור נדר</b> (swear an oath) etc., the sages of blessed memory will give a homiletical interpretion. And it must be that the concept of the noun will contradict the concept of the verb, since the noun indicates a matter that was already in existence and was already called by the noun, while the verb teaches that the noun now comes into existence.
Thus, they explain several times that the noun that is added to the verb teaches that it was already a reality before the action - <b>יומת המת</b> (shall he that is to die be put to death)<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 17:6.</i> – from the beginning, <b>יקריב קרבן</b> (bring an offering) – that his holy dedication precedes his offering, etc.

Klal 37

And moreover, whenever a verb is added onto a noun from the same root, there are reasons:
As when they interpret when it repeats <b>חטאתו אשר חטא</b> (his sin, which he has sinned)<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:3.</i> and in Rule 316, there are on this nine interpretations for its nine repetitions.
And moreover, when it interprets <b>טומאתו</b> (his uncleanness)<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:3.</i> – his own uncleanness. <b>אשר יטמא</b> (be wherewith he is unclean)<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i> – that he receives uncleanness from another place.
And moreover, <b>על שגגתו</b> (concerning the error)<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:18.</i> – it focuses on the unintentional. <b>אשר שגג</b> (which he committed)<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i> – it focuses on the subject.
And moreover, <b>את הגזלה</b> (that which he took)<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:23.</i> – even that which his father took. <b>אשר גזל</b> (by robbery)<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i> – that he stole it himself.
And there is a difference between the noun <b>המשכב</b> (bed)<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 15:4.</i> and the verb <b>אשר ישכב</b> (whereon he lies)<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>.

Klal 38

And moreover, when the infinitive of a verb comes before the verb, it comes to teach that the action can be done in any manner, even several times.
As is interpreted when it is written, <b>אשֹם אָשַם</b> (It is a guilt-offering - <b>he is certainly guilty</b> before the LORD)<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:19.</i> – all types of guilt.
<b>האכל יאכל</b> (And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings <b>be at all eaten</b> on the third day, it shall not be accepted)<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:18.</i> –several eatings.
<b>דרש דרש</b> (And Moses <b>diligently inquired</b> for the goat of the sin-offering, and, behold, it was burnt)<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 10:16.</i> – several inquiries.

Klal 39

And sometimes an infinitive comes before a verb to indicate an obligation in a statement, that it is a mistake to think that it only means it is optional. For instance, when imperatives are restricted against a warning (as will be explained later in Rule 228).<br><br><i>Leviticus 6:23 says, </i>וכל חטאת אשר יובא מדמה אל אהל מועד לכפר בקדש לא תאכל באש תשרף<i> (And no sin-offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place, shall be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire).</i><br><br><i>And Leviticus 10:18 says, </i>הן לא הובא את דמה אל הקדש פנימה אכול תאכלו אתה בקדש כאשר צויתי<i> (Behold, the blood of it was not brought into the sanctuary within; you should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded).</i><br><br><i>This is an example of an imperative that is restricted against a warning. The warning </i>לא תאכל<i>, in Leviticus 6:23, is not to eat the sin offering when the blood of it was brought into the holy place. The imperative </i>אכול תאכלו<i>, in Leviticus 10:18, is that one must eat the sin offering when the blood of it was not brought into the holy place<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Shemini 57.</i>.</i>

Klal 40

And the infinitive before a verb that comes with a negation:
It sometimes teaches that the verb was proper to be, but was not; <b>בוש לא יבושו</b> (they are not at all ashamed)<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 6:15.</i> <b>בכה לא תבכה</b> (you shall weep no more)<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 30:19.</i>.
And it sometimes teaches that the verb means <i>precisely</i>; <b>ואכול לא תאכלוהו</b> (but you shall in no wise eat of it)<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:24.</i> - but benefit is permitted.<br><br><i>Jeremiah 6:15 uses the language <b>בוש לא יבושו</b> when it says,הבישו כי תועבה עשו גם בוש לא יבושו גם הכלים לא ידעו לכן יפלו בנפלים בעת פקדתים יכשלו אמר יהוה (They shall be put to shame because they have committed abomination; yea, they are not at all ashamed, neither know they how to blush; therefore they shall fall among them that fall, at the time that I punish them they shall stumble, says the LORD), meaning that they should be ashamed, but they are not.</i><br><br><i>Isaiah 30:19 uses the language <b>בכה לא תבכה</b> when it says,כי עם בציון ישב בירושלם בכו לא תבכה חנון יחנך לקול זעקך כשמעתו ענך (For, O people that dwell in Zion at Jerusalem, you shall weep no more; He will surely be gracious to you at the voice of your cry, when He shall hear, He will answer you), meaning that they should weep, but they will not weep.</i>

Klal 41

The letter <b>ו</b> that comes at the beginning of a verb in past tense – sometimes it connects and sometimes it reverses the past to the future. And the linguists give a rule of thumb that if it comes after a future tense verb, the <b>ו</b> reverses (the past to future), and if it comes after a past tense verb, the <b>ו</b> connects.
And there are places where if it is viewed with respect to the primary insight of the expression, it will speak in future tense, but if it is viewed with respect to the particular verb that comes before it in the expression, a past tense verb will come before it. And because of this ambiguous language, the sages of blessed memory will always interpret in it also the second meaning, that it is not a reversing <b>ו</b>, but a connecting <b>ו</b>.
Like השעיר אשר עלה עליו הגורל לה' <b>ועשהו</b> חטאת (the goat upon which the lot fell for the LORD, and offer him for a sin-offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:9.</i> – they interpret the pronoun inעשהו to be referring to the lot, that the lot is to be offered for a sin-offering, and it is because of this that the verb is in past tense, like the verb עלה that is before it.
And moreover when it is written ועשה את דמו כאשר עשה לדם הפר <b>והזה</b> אותו (and do with his blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it)<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:15.</i>, the verb והזה is in past tense like the verb עשה that is before it.
And moreover, when it is written in the chapter about the affliction of houses ובא הכהן וראה והנה פשה (then the priest shall come in and look; and, behold, if the plague be spread)<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:44.</i>, it is a ו that connects.
And moreover, when it is written <b>והעלה</b> הכהן את העולה (And the priest shall offer the burnt-offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:20.</i>.

Klal 42

A future tense verb can come in two ways, if there is a prefix ו.
a) A past tense verb reverses to future tense through the ו at the beginning of the words, like <b>וסמך ושחט</b> (And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it)<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 3:2.</i>.
b) A future tense verb with the ו that connects, like <b>ואעשך</b> לגוי גדול <b>ואברכך</b> (And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you)<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 12:2.</i>.
And there is a difference between them: The future tense with a reversing ו is talking about the past relative to a future time; it means to say that it speaks about a matter that will be finished and completed at a time in the future. But the future tense with a ו that connects intends to say that it will become active in the future – not that it will be finished and completed. Thus, this future usually comes with respect to revealing intent, seeking, and indicating the beginning of the action and its continuation. And a future tense verb with a ו that reverses establishes the completion and termination.
And this is the foundation that the sages of blessed memory used for several great interpretations. And so when it writes וטמא עד הערב וטהר (and it shall be unclean until the evening; then it shall be clean)<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 11:32.</i>, there is an inconsistency in the language, and they interpret this to mean that it was already clean from a certain matter.<br><br><i>The key to understanding Rule 42 is to understand the difference between perfect and imperfect verbs. (See Rule 12 for the definition of a perfect verb and an imperfect verb.) When the Malbim speaks about past tense and future tense verbs throughout his commentary on the Scripture, he is actually speaking about perfect and imperfect tense verbs, since verbs in the Torah have only two tenses, perfect and imperfect. According to Rule 42, a </i>ו<i> that reverses or connects does not change its status as a perfect or imperfect tense verb; it can only change whether the verb is to be interpreted as taking place in the future or in the past.</i><br><br><i>In the instance of <b>וסמך ושחט</b>, it is not really two past tense verbs with a </i>ו<i> that reverses the tense to the future, but two perfect tense verbs that will be finished and completed some time in the future. And in the instance of </i><b>ואעשך</b> לגוי גדול <b>ואברכך</b><i>, it is not really two future tense verbs with a </i>ו<i> that connects, but two imperfect tense verbs which will become active in the future.</i>

Klal 43

And sometimes the past tense verb will have already been done previously.
ונמצה דמו (and the blood thereof shall be drained out)<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:15.</i> – long ago before it was offered.
ויתן אל החושן את האורים (and in the breastplate he put the Urim)<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 8:8.</i> – long ago.
וירד מעשות (and he came down from offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 9:22.</i> – and he had already come down.
והעלה (shall offer)<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:20.</i> – already.
And moreover, it appears to Rabbi Elazar that when it is written ויאמר ה' אל משה (and the LORD said to Moses)<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:2.</i>, it means <i>and he had already said previously</i>.

Klal 44

And there are instances in the Scripture where a past tense verb comes instead of a future tense verb:
ומולדתך אשר הולדת אחריהם (And your issue, that you beget after them)<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 48:6.</i>.
אל פתח אהל מועד לא הביאו (What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that kills an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that kills it without the camp, <b>and has not brought it to the door of the tent of meeting</b>, to present it as an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD, blood shall be imputed unto that man; he has shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people)<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 17:3-4.</i>. הביאו should be in future tense, but it is unable to say יביאו, since this would imply that it is talking about after the slaughter.

Klal 45

<b>ויבוא עתיד במקום עבר</b> (When future tense comes instead of past tense):<b></b>
To teach about the present or the permanence: אשר ישכב עליו הזב (whereon he that has the issue)<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 15:4.</i> it means to say <i>routinely</i>.
Or to teach that the matter still stands. Therefore, it said אשר יהיה בעורו שחין(And when the flesh has in the skin thereof a boil)<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:18.</i>, that some of the boils still exist.
Or it comes to teach about the thought of the subject, אם האכל יאכל (And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings be at all eaten)<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:18.</i> - that the thought is to eat.

Klal 46

And in a conditional statement, the custom of the language is that the first verb that is next to the word כי is to come in future tense, and the verbs that come after it - whether they come to clarify the subject or restrict it with a division – they are to come in either past tense or present tense, according to the intention of the speaker. And any place where it deviates from this rule, the sages of blessed memory will give a homiletical interpretation.
As when it is written, אם הכהן המשיח יחטא (if the anointed priest shall sin)<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:3.</i>, אשר נשיא יחטא (When a ruler sins)<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:22.</i>, they interpret it to mean that he will not bring a sacrifice for his sins committed before being anointed.
And when it is written ואם כבש יביא (And if he bring a lamb)<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:32.</i> and moreover when it is written אם על תודה יקריבנו (If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving…)<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:12.</i>, they interpret that if one set aside his offering and it was lost and then he set aside a different one in its place and afterwards the first one was found, one might think that he is required to offer both. However, the words יביאנה (he shall bring it) and יקריבנו (he shall offer it) teach that one is only required to offer one.
And when it is written אשר יזה מדמה (and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof)<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:20.</i>, it means that it is precise - if not yet sprinkled.
ואם האכל יאכל (And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings be at all eaten)<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:18.</i>, it is talking about the thought.

Klal 47

Any place where it uses the singular noun<b>נפש</b> (soul) or <b>איש</b>(man), it is referring to an individual, not a community.
And the noun <b>נפש</b> can also be of an idol worshipper or a woman. And moreover, a <b>נפש</b> can also be of an animal.

Klal 48

In a place where a singular masculine noun comes, it needs an amplificatory expression to include women, as when it is written הגר (that sojourns)<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:29.</i> it needs to include women. And moreover, with the noun כהן (priest)<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:16.</i>, it does not include a כהנת (female priest) at all, according to the <i>Sifra</i>. And moreover, in a place where it is written in masculine gender, as when Rabbi Yehuda deduces that the law against sterilization does not apply to a female from where it is written משחתם בהם (because their corruption is in them)<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 22:25.</i> in masculine.
However, with the name of a type/species, women are also included.

Klal 49

And whenever any species/type comes in singular – the custom of the language is to add on the prefix letter ה, which teaches about all of the species/type. And if it comes on a proper noun, then the ה will be a definite article.
And from this, the sages of blessed memory conclude that the noun <b>האזרח</b> (home-born) is a species/type name in all of the Scripture, except when האזרח is written with respect to סוכה (booths)<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 23:42.</i>; there is a law that Moses received at Mount Sinai that there it is a noun with the status of a verb.<br><br><i>A definite article is a word that is used with a noun to indicate that the noun is specific. In English, the word “the” is the only definite article. In Hebrew, the prefix </i>ה<i> is the only definite article.</i><br><br><i>Leviticus 16:29 says,</i>והיתה לכם לחקת עולם בחדש השביעי בעשור לחדש תענו את נפשתיכם וכל מלאכה לא תעשו האזרח והגר הגר בתוככם<i> (And it shall be a statute for ever to you: in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict your souls, and shall do no manner of work, the home-born, or the stranger that resides among you), using the noun האזרח to mean home-born. The </i>ה<i> is interpreted to mean that האזרח is a species/type name, indicating that it includes homeborn women as well as men<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Acharei Mot 74.</i>.</i><br><br><i>There are laws that Moses received at Mount Sinai, which have no reference in the Scripture, but were nevertheless transmitted orally since the time of Moses. One such law is the interpretation that in Leviticus 23:42, האזרח is a noun with the status of a verb.</i>

If the name of a species comes without a ה, it teaches about many members of the species, not about all of the members of the species.<br><br><i>For example, Genesis 32:6 says ויהי לי שור וחמור (And I have oxen, and asses) without the prefix </i>ה<i> on שור and חמור, indicating that it is talking about many but not all of the members of the species.</i>

Klal 51

And there is a difference between when it will speak about the name of a species (including the individuals of the species) without the letter ה<a dir="ltr"> </a>(<b>בקר וצאן הקריבו</b>) and when it will speak with the letter ה and the word <a dir="rtl">מן</a> - (<b>מן הבהמה מן הבקר ומן הצאן</b>), that then it always comes to limit, because the letter מ means <i>part of</i>.<br><br><i>For instance, Leviticus 1:14 says, </i>ואם מן העוף עלה קרבנו ליהוה והקריב מן התרים או מן בני היונה את קרבנו<i> (And if his offering to the LORD be a burnt-offering of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtle-doves, or of young pigeons), using the language</i> מן העוף <i>for “of fowls” instead of</i> עוף <i>(fowl) This indicates that not all fowls are valid offerings. For instance, it comes to exclude any fowl that is missing a limb<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 71.</i>.</i>

Klal 52

A noun in construct state<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">Construct state is a grammatical structure that is common in Semitic languages like Hebrew in which two consecutive nouns indicate possession or modification of the first noun by the second noun. For instance, when the noun זבחי (sacrifices) is placed before the noun תודה (thanksgiving), it means “sacrifices of thanksgiving”.</i> does not speak about plural things in singular; rather it will say זבחי תודה (sacrifices of thanksgiving), זבחי שלמים (sacrifices of peace). And thus, when it says על <b>זבח</b> התודה (with the sacrifice of thanksgiving)<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:12.</i> – it adds the construct זבח so that one will not err and think that תודה is the name of a type of offering.

Klal 53

There is a difference between species names and collective nouns: Species names can come in plural and in singular, but collective nouns never come in singular, like the collective nouns, <b>חטה</b> (wheat), <b>שעורה</b> (barley), <b>פשתה</b> (flax), <b>ענב</b> (grapes).
And moreover, the noun <b>שֵעָר</b> (hair) is a collection of hairs and in construct state is שער ראשו- <i>the hair of his head</i>, but <b>שערה</b> (hair) is a singular noun (and the noun <b>שַעַר</b> with a פתח vowel refers to hair that is not typical). And from this, the sages of blessed memory teach that שֵעָר is never less than two hairs.

Klal 54

The verb usually comes in singular with respect to the name of a species. And we also find it in plural, particularly in places where it is possible to make a mistake and think it is a singular noun.

Klal 55

And moreover, with a collective noun – <b>עדה</b> (congregation), <b>מחנה</b> (camp), etc. – the verb that is before it will come in singular and sometimes in plural - <b>ותשא</b> כל העדה (And all the congregation lifted)<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 14:1.</i>, <b>ויבואו</b> כל העדה (And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came)<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 20:1.</i>. And there is a distinction: Whenever it is speaking about them as a whole, the verb will come in singular, and whenever it is speaking about each individual, it will come in plural.

Klal 56

And the names of metals do not come in plural, for instance <b>כסף נחושת ברזל</b> (silver, copper, iron). And they say about the verse כי יתן איש אל רעהו כסף או כלים (If a man deliver to his neighbour money or stuff to keep)<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 22:6.</i> <i>מה כלים שנים אף כסף שנים</i> (just as כלים is plural, so too כסף must be plural)<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Babylonian Talmud Shevuot 39b.</i>.
And the custom of the language is to say <b>חלב</b> השלמים (fat of the peace offerings) in singular. And when it says <b>חלבי</b> השלמים (fat of the peace offerings)<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:5.</i> – it is in plural, meaning a diversity of fats of all types of the sacrifices, and it uses the language שלמים (peace offerings) because their laws are explained in detail through the laws of שלמים.

Klal 57

And the noun <b>קשקשת</b> (fish scales)<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 11:9.</i> according to the anonymous first opinion (in <i>Sifra</i>) is a singular noun, likeצנצנת (jar). And according to Rabbi Yehuda, it is a collective noun, while the singular form of the noun is קשקש – he reasoned that if it were a singular noun, it would have been written in plural as קשקשות, not קשקשים.
And there are nouns that will always come in plural, for example <b>ערבי נחל</b> (willows of the brook). And see more in chapter 33; for nouns <b>צאן כבשים עזים</b> (sheep, lamb, goats), etc., there are many rules pertaining to this matter.

Klal 58

Nevertheless, when it comes with the collective noun נר (lamp) in singular and it uses the verb in singular - יערך אותו (Aaron and his sons shall set it in order)<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 27:21.</i> – the sages of blessed memory explain that when this is written again<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 24:2.</i>, it comes for a homiletical interpretation, that it means the one western lamp. And when נר is written in singular<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 27:20.</i>, there is a homiletical interpretation with respect to the fact that it does not say נרות (lamps).
And ידו (his hands)<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:21.</i> with respect to ordination means <i>his hands</i>, and it comes in singular to inform of the power, and they learn this from the fact that it is written as ידו but is supposed to be read as ידיו.

Klal 59

Sometimes the adjective precedes the noun being modified - <b>שני תולעת</b> - <b>תולעת שני</b>,<b>עמים רבים</b> - <b>רבים עמים</b>. And moreover <b>שופר תרועה, אחד קדוש, משנה כסף</b> . Therefore, whenever two nouns come with an adjective in-between them, it is impossible to determine whether the adjective is relevant to the first noun or the second noun.
Like אביב קלוי באש גרש (corn in the ear parched with fire, even groats of the fresh ear)<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 2:14.</i> – one can either interpret it as אביב קלוי or one can interpret it as קלוי גרש, and that it means to say גרש קלוי; however, the rule of the language is that the adjective needs to be next to the noun that it modifies and the words that come to clarify the adjective must come at the end, so when it says קלוי באש, it is impossible to say that it is modifying the word גרש, that if so, it would have written גרש קלוי באש.
And moreover, when it is written <b>על חלת לחם חמץ</b> (With cakes of leavened bread)<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:13.</i>, it is impossible to interpret it as <i>לחם חלה</i> (where <i>לחם</i> is modified by <i>חלה</i>), since חמץ is right after לחם; if so, it would have written לחם חלה חמץ.

Klal 60

Nevertheless, the sages of blessed memory explain through homiletical interpretation the reason for the ordering of words; the noun being modifed precedes the adjective, according to the rules. As when it is written את בשר ערלתו (the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised)<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 12:3.</i> – (it is proper to say את ערלת בשרו – the foreskin of his flesh), they interpret this to mean the flesh that is on the foreskin - even if there is a bright spot, it should be cut.

Klal 61

And whenever two nouns are in construct state – the first noun will be the primary.
<b>גחלי אש</b> (coals of fire) – the noun גחלים (coals) is the primary, and the noun אש (fire) modifies the noun גחלים (coals); that it will be burning, and that the fire requires the coals in order to exist.
And there is a difference between <b>שני תולעת</b> and <b>תולעת שני</b>, as when it says תולעת שני, the noun שני (scarlet) clarifies the noun תולעת (worm) and excludes worms of the color black. And when it says שני תולעת, the noun תולעת (worm) modifies the noun שני (scarlet) and excludes scarlet that is made from another thing. And there is a difference between them: תולעת שני – the noun תולעת is the main noun and one is able to dye with all blood of the worm, and שני תולעת - the noun שני is the main noun and one is only able to dye with the scarlet blood that is in a worm, not with black blood that is in it.

Klal 62

Construct state will only be with a noun, not with a verb or another part of speech. The word <b>אשר</b> is an exception to the rule. And the sages of blessed memory gave support to this when it is written כל ימי אשר הנגע בו (All the days wherein the plague is in him)<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:46.</i>.

Klal 63

The adjectives which express attributes of a man come without the word איש (like <b>צדיק, חכם, חסיד, עור, פסח</b> – righteous man, wise man, pious man, blind man, crippled man). And whenever it adds איש צדיק or איש עור – it always comes with a special meaning, and it means to be precise that he is a distinguished and special man or that a matter depends on the man, etc.<br><br><i>For instance, when it says in Genesis 6:9, נח איש צדיק (Noah was in his generations a man righteous), the word איש teaches that he was famous and known to be righteous<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Acharei Mot 56.</i>.</i><br><br><i>And when it says in Leviticus 21:18, </i>איש עור<i> (blind man), the word איש teaches that it includes men whose eyes are not blind; nevertheless, the man is blind. For instance, if there are white spots on the cornea or water is constantly dripping from the eye<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Emor 46.</i>.</i>

Klal 64

Any place where a singular noun comes, it is not necessary to say the number אחד (one) with it. And any place where the number אחד comes with a singular noun (like <b>איל אחד</b> - one ram, <b>כבש אחד</b> - one he-lamb, <b>לוג אחד</b> - one <i>log</i>, a biblical measure of volume, etc.) there will be a homiletical interpretation.
And sages of blessed memory explain that this will occur in a place where there is a mistake as to what to learn, for example: There is a logical reason as to why it could be more than one. Or it comes to exclude one-half. Or it comes to teach that it will be a special one and the best in its type. Or to teach that each one will be special and distinguished from its associate. Or it clarifies that the noun is a name of a type, as with עד אחד (one witness) where עד is the name of a type.

Klal 65

And moreover, whenever it says <b>אחת מכל</b>, (like ועשה <b>אחת מכל</b> מצות השם - and does through error any one of all the things which the LORD his God has commanded not to be done<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:22.</i>), the word אחת is superfluous; the letter מ in the wordמכל already implies “any one of” (like אשר יעשה מכל התועבות - For whosoever shall do any of these abominations<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 18:29.</i>). And it is always homiletically interpreted that there is an obligation with respect to each and every one of the things that God has commanded.<br><br><i>Leviticus 4:22-23 says,</i>אשר נשיא יחטא ועשה אחת מכל מצות יהוה אלהיו אשר לא תעשינה בשגגה ואשם. או הודע אליו חטאתו אשר חטא בה והביא את קרבנו שעיר עזים זכר תמים<i> (When a ruler sins, and does through error any one of all the things which the LORD his God has commanded not to be done, and is guilty: if his sin, wherein he has sinned, be known to him, he shall bring for his offering a goat, a male without blemish). The word אחת is there to teach that for each sin, the ruler is obligated to bring a sin-offering.</i>

Klal 66

And ordinary plural is never less than two. Thus, any place where it says a plural noun with an imperative verb, it is unnecessary to say the number שנים (two), as presumably it meant two. And thus, any place where it says <b>שני כבשים</b> (two lambs), <b>שתי תורים</b> (two turtle-doves), <b>שתי שעירים</b> (two goats), etc., – the sages of blessed memory explain that it must be in a place where one could make a mistake as to what it is actually teaching: Either logic dictates that it could be more than two, or the number two comes to teach that they should both be alike.

Klal 67

And the sages of blessed memory had a rule in language that there is a difference between the number <b>שנים</b> - <b>שתים</b> (two) as an ordinary cardinal number and <b>שני</b> - <b>שתי</b> (second) as a construct cardinal number: Whenever it says שני כבשים (two he-lambs) or שני שעירים (two he-goats) – it is precise in that they must be alike in all respects. And whenever it says שנים כבשים (two he-lambs), it is not precise that they must be alike in all respects.

Klal 68

And the name of a number comes in two forms, ordinary cardinal (<b>שנים, שלושה, ארבעה</b>) (two, three, four) and construct cardinal (<b>שני, שלושת, ארבעת</b>) (two of, three of, four of). And the grammarians call the first type <i>מספר המחובר אל המתואר</i> <i>(a number that is connected to that which it modifies)</i>. And they call the second type <i>מספר המופשט מן המתואר</i> <i>(a number that is abstracted from that which it modifies)</i>. And they searched for the difference between these two forms, but they could not find one.
And I found that usually the number will come in construct cardinal if it is a known number - whether it is known on its own or through other ways of knowing (for instance, if it was already mentioned; if in its place, if in another place), or there is a reference to another number through which one knows it. And this was also the opinion of the sages of blessed memory.

Klal 69

And also the number <b>אחד</b> (one) will come in construct cardinal declension and ordinary cardinal declension - <b>אֶחָד</b>. <b>אַחַד</b> – when it comes in construct cardinal declension, the letter מ will sometimes come after it - כנפש <b>אַחַד</b> מהם (as the life of one of them)<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">1 Kings 19:2.</i>, and sometimes the definite article ה will come after it - <b>אַחַד</b> ההרים(one of the mountains)<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 22:2.</i>.
And the grammarians write that <b>אֶחָד</b> and <b>אַחַד</b> are of two declensions:
<b>אֶחָד</b> is of <i>heavy</i> declension like <b>סַבָּל</b> ,<b>שַבָּת</b> ,<b>גחָל</b> ,<b>פֶּחָם</b>.
And <b>אַחַד</b> is of <i>light</i> declension like <b>נַחַש</b> ,<b>שַחַת</b>.
And indeed, sometimes the noun אַחַד is not a declension on its own, but only a noun that comes in construct state that is derived from the noun אֶחָד. And this is when the definite article ה comes afterwards like אַחַד העם (one of the people),אחד ההרים (one of the mountains). Only if the prefix מ comes afterwards will it not come in construct state, and then it will definitely be of light declension.
And with this stand the differences between <b>אֶחָד</b> of heavy declension and <b>אַחַד</b> of light declension: When אֶחָד comes, it intends to exclude duality, and it means to say “one and not two”. And with the noun אַחַד, it does not intend to exclude duality, only that it is a noun that indicates generality, and it means to say “any one that will be”. And for the noun אַחַד in which the definite article ה comes afterwards and is derived from heavy declension and comes in construct state, its rule is like that of the nouns שלושת (third), ארבעת (fourth) that I mentioned in the previous rule, which come to indicate that it is a known number. And thus, when it says אַחַד ההרים, it means to say it is a known mountain, which is Mount Moriah; אחד העם (one of the people) – is the king, etc.

Klal 70

And with the number <b>אַחַת</b> in feminine – which is never found with the declension <b>אֶחָת</b> – there is another difference between when the prefix מ comes after it and when the definite article ה comes after it:
If the intention of the speaker is to refer to the general and it means to say <i>any one that will be</i> – the word אחת will be next to the definite article ה or it will come in construct stateהנה הוא נחבא באחת הפחתים (Behold, he is hid now in some pit)<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">2 Samuel 17:9.</i>, יתנו לי מקום באחת ערי הממלכה (let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country)<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">1 Samuel 27:5.</i>.
But if the intention is to emphasize the unity and to eliminate the multiplicity, the prefix מwill come afterwards - ואנקמה נקם אחת משתי עיני (that I may be this once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes)<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Judges 16:28.</i>.

Klal 71

And if it mentions the number two or three and afterwards mentions minute details through the words <b>אחד אחד</b> (one…one…) – then the two numbers will come identically; whether with the definite article ה [<b>האחד...האחד</b>] or without the ה, [<b>אחד..אחד</b>]. And moreover, all ordinal numbers will come identically – whether as <b>ראשון שני שלישי</b> (first, second, third) or as <b>הראשון השני השלישי</b> (the first, the second, the third).
And if one אחד comes with the letter ה and another אחד comes without the letter ה, it is peculiar and there will be a homiletical interpretation.

Klal 72

And there is in this a rule:
If it mentions <b>אחד..אחד</b> from the point of view that both are one pair and this is known by the total number שנים – it will say both of them with the definite article ה. Like ויתנו לנו <b>שנים פרים</b> ויבחרו להם <b>הפר האחד</b> ואני אעשה את <b>הפר האחד</b> (Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under; and I will dress the other bullock)<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">1 Kings 18:23.</i>.
And if it will not say it from this point of view, it will say אחד...אחד without the letter ה.

Klal 73

It is not the custom of the language to say the word אחת (one) without the thing which it is counting; as it will always say <b>פעם אחת</b> (one time) (unless it is in a place where the thing which it is counting is known through the noun or the verb that accompanies it).
And when it is written וכפר אהרן על קרנותיו אחת בשנה (And Aaron shall make atonement upon the horns of it once in the year)<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 30:10.</i>, the language is peculiar. And they interpret the word אחת to go with the verbוכפר , and that it means to say <i>וכפר אחת</i> (And make atonement once).

Klal 74

However, if the noun which is modified is mentioned in general – it does not need to mention it again as a particular. Like במסילות אשר אחת עולה בית אל ואחת גבעתה (in the highways, of which one goes up to Beth-el, and the other to Gibeah, about thirty men of Israel)<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Judges 20:31.</i>, and it does not say מסילה אחת (the other highway).
And when it is written ונתן..גורלות גורל אחד..וגורל אחד (And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats: one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for Azazel)<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:8.</i>, it mentions the noun that is modified twice, and there is a homiletical interpretation.<br><br><i>Leviticus 16:8 says, </i>ונתן אהרן על שני השעירם גורלות גורל אחד ליהוה וגורל אחד לעזאזל<i> (And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats: one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for Azazel). The reason why it repeats the word גורל, which means “lot”, is so that one will not misunderstand and think that he should place the lot of the LORD and the lot of Azazel on one goat and the lot of the LORD and the lot of Azazel on the other goat<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Acharei Mot 23.</i>.</i>

Klal 75

Anything that comes only as a cardinal number and not an ordinal number does not have to be consecutive. For example, if it says בניתי את הבית <b>עשר שנים</b> (I built the house for ten years), they do not have to be ten consecutive years.
And in a place where it is strict on being consecutive, there will come in it a special teaching.

Klal 76

The grammarians wrote that for a number less than ten, the noun with it will be counted in plural, and for a number greater than ten, the noun with it will be counted in singular.
And after investigation, I saw that although with a number less than ten their words are correct, with a number greater than ten, their rule is not credible. And we find: <b>שנה שנים</b> (year, years), <b>איש אנשים</b> (man, men), <b>אמה אמות</b> (mother, mothers).
And according to the sages of blessed memory, there was a rule for this, that in all of the Scripture, whenever something is counted (with a number greater than ten) in singular – it teaches that all of the things that are counted are similar to one another.

Klal 77

Numbers with three digits – sometimes the noun which is counted is repeated with every digit (<b>מאה שנה ועשרים שנה ושבע שנים</b> - a hundred and seven and twenty years)<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 23:1.</i>. And sometimes not.
And the sages of blessed memory interpret that any place where the noun that is counted is repeated, it comes to compare the noun in a certain matter, in accordance with Rule 144 regarding nouns that are repeated.
Indeed, when the noun <b>מְאַת</b> (hundred of) as a construct cardinal has with it numerals representing tens and ones and the name <b>מְאַת</b> comes before these other numerals – that which is counted must be repeated, since a noun that is in construct state must come right after its corresponding noun without a break.<br><br><i>Genesis 25:7 says, ואלה ימי שני חיי אברהם אשר חי מאת שנה ושבעים שנה וחמש שנים (And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, a hundred seventy-five years), using the words מאת שנה ושבעים שנה וחמש שנים for “a hundred seventy-five years”, where the noun which is counted שנה (year) is repeated, in accordance with Rule 77.</i>

Klal 78

And there is a difference between whether the number is at the beginning of an expression or whether it comes at the end:
If the number comes after the verb, it will sometimes be <i>up to but not including.</i>
But if the number precedes it – as with שבעת ימים מצות תאכלו (Seven days shall you eat unleavened bread)<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 12:15.</i>, שבעת ימים תהיה בנדתה (she shall be in her impurity seven days)<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 15:19.</i> – it needs seven full days, and we do not say <i>part of the day is like all of it</i>.

Klal 79

The ordinal numbers <b>ראשון</b> (first),<b>שני</b> (second),<b>שלישי</b> (third) are only correct with things in which one precedes its successor in time or in place, not with things that are completely separate.
And thus, when it is written כאשר שרף את הפר הראשון (as he burned the first bullock)<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:21.</i>, it is interpreted that it was the first to be sacrificed.

Klal 80

And we find several times the ordinal number without the noun that it is modifying, in particular in a place where the noun that it modifies was already said in the beginning, like ויחטאהו כראשון (and offered it for sin, as the first)<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 9:15.</i>.
And when it is written כאשר שרף את הפר הראשון (as he burned the first bullock)<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:21.</i>, there is a homiletical interpretation.<br><br><i>Leviticus 4:21 says,</i>והוציא את הפר אל מחוץ למחנה ושרף אתו כאשר שרף את הפר הראשון חטאת הקהל הוא <i>(And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bullock; it is the sin-offering for the assembly). Why did it mention the word </i>הפר<i>, meaning the bullock, a second time, when it could have just said </i>הראשון<i>, meaning the first? This is to teach that the bullock comes first and not the idolatry goats<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 255.</i>.</i>

Klal 81

The ordinal number [<b>ראשון שני שלישי</b>] (first, second, third) always comes after the noun phrase that it modifies. And when it is written פר שני בן בקר (another young bullock)<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 8:8.</i>, it is peculiar; it should have been written פר בן בקר שני. And the sages of blessed memory interpret this to mean that it will be in its second year, because through the grammar, it is proper to say <b>שְנִיִי</b> (second), like a third or a fourth. And they rely on the fact that it comes out of the noun שנה, like the declensions <b>כֶלִי חֵצִי</b>.
And nevertheless, the custom is that the number comes immediately before the noun that it modifies like ועשרון אחד סולת. And when it is written ועשרון סולת אחד (and one tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil)<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:21.</i>, there is a homiletical interpretation.

Klal 82

Any place where it mentions a certain number and afterwards an ordinal number referring to days – it always means counting consecutive days, not the day of the month.<b>שבעת ימים</b> יהיה עם אמו, <b>ביום השמיני</b> תתנו לי (seven days it shall be with its dam; on the eighth day you shall give it Me)<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 22:29.</i>.
And when it intends to refer to the day of the month, it will always say באחד לחדש (first day of the month) or בשני לחדש (second day of the month).

Klal 83

Due to the elegance of the language, whenever it mentions the day of the month:
If it is a number less than ten, it will not mention the word יום (day); it will only say באחד לחודש (on the first of the month) or בחמישה לחודש (on the fifth of the month).
And for numbers greater than or equal to ten, the word יום (day) comes - בארבעה עשר <b>יום</b> (on the fourteenth day), בחמישה עשר <b>יום</b> (on the fifteenth day). And the sages of blessed memory give a reason for this.

Klal 84

And there is a difference between when it says <b>בשנה השביעית</b> שבת שבתון (in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land)<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 25:4.</i> and when it says <b>ובשביעית</b> יצא לחופשי (and in the seventh he shall go out free)<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 21:2.</i>, without the word שנה (year): Any place where it adds the noun שנה, we count according to the Hebrew calendar, beginning on <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>.<br><br><i>Exodus 21:2 says, </i>כי תקנה עבד עברי שש שנים יעבד ובשבעת יצא לחפשי חנם<i> (and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing) without the noun שנה (year). Because of this, the years are counted according to the day in which the Hebrew servant was purchased.</i><br><br><i>Leviticus 25:4 says, </i>ובשנה השביעת שבת שבתון יהיה לארץ שבת ליהוה שדך לא תזרע וכרמך לא תזמר<i> (But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a sabbath to the LORD). Because it says the word שנה, we count according to the Hebrew calendar, beginning on the first of the month of Tishrei, Rosh Hashanah.</i>

There is a difference between ordinal numbers [<b>ששי רביעי חמישי</b>](sixth, fourth, fifth) and fractional numbers [<b>שלישית רביעית חמישית</b>] (one-third, one-fourth, one-fifth): Ordinal numbers will be counted <i>from outside</i> of that which comes before it, while a fractional number will always be <i>from within</i>. Indeed, this is precisely the breaking of a whole number, but if it says ויסף חמישיתו עליו (and shall add the fifth part thereto)<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:16.</i> – then the fifth part is added to the whole and it is <i>from without</i>.<br><br><i>The words מלגאו (from within) and מלבר (from without) are used here in a way that apparently has no counterpart in English.</i><br><br><i>If one counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, the number 5 is considered to be “from outside of 4”. And if one computes one third of 12, one gets 4, which is considered to be “from within 12”.</i><br><br><i>And when Leviticus 5:16 says, ואת אשר חטא מן הקדש ישלם ואת חמישתו יוסף עליו ונתן אתו לכהן והכהן יכפר עליו באיל האשם ונסלח לו (And he shall make restitution for that which he hath done amiss in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt-offering, and he shall be forgiven), it means that if the principal is 100 zuz, then he must add 25 extra zuz to this, since 25 is one-fifth of 125 and 125 zuz minus 25 zuz equals 100 zuz. In this case, it is considered to be “from without”. “From within” would mean to add 20 extra zuz to the principal of 100 zuz, since one-fifth of 100 is 20.</i>

Klal 86

When it is written <b>וחמישיותיו</b> (fifth part)<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:24.</i>, it is composed of singular and plural. And just like it, <b>עצתך</b> (your counsels), <b>זנותיכם</b> (your strayings), <b>תהלתיך</b> (your praises), etc. This is because an abstract noun normally comes in singular, unless for example a man praises time and time again (plural <b>תהלתיך</b>) or a man advises time and time again (plural <b>עצתך</b>). And moreover, with respect to <b>וחמישיותיו</b> when one only adds one fifth, it will be in singular. And when adding a fifth of a fifth if one admits to owing the fifth, it will be plural. And this is according to the opinion of the sages of blessed memory, that one adds a fifth of a fifth, but not according to Rabbi Abraham ben Meir Ibn Ezra, whose opinion is that one pays two fifths.<br><br><i>Leviticus 5:24 says,</i> או מכל אשר ישבע עליו לשקר ושלם אתו בראשו וחמשתיו יסף עליו לאשר הוא לו יתננו ביום אשמתו <i>(or any thing about which he has sworn falsely, he shall even restore it in full, and shall add the fifth part more thereto; unto him to whom it appertains shall he give it, in the day of his being guilty).</i>

Klal 87

There is a difference between the noun <b>מחצית</b> (half) and the noun <b>חצי</b> (half). מחצית is a thing that is carefully divided by a person into two equal parts, but חצי means divided in half on its own, or it is a specific measurement with no current need to be divided, or it is not carefully divided into two equal parts.<br><br><i>An example of “divided in half on its own” is </i>חצי הלילה<i> (half of the night). An example of “a specific measurement with no current need to be divided” is </i>חצי האמה<i> (half of a cubit).

There is a difference between<b>ארבעים יכנו</b> (forty stripes he may give him)<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 25:3.</i> and <b>שלש פעמים</b> תכה את ארם (you shall smite Aram but three times)<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">2 Kings 13:19.</i>: ארבעים יכנו is all in one occurrence, while שלש פעמים is in three separate occurrences.

For most nouns and verbs, there is a precise meaning if we are to assume they come to be completely precise. Nevertheless, sometimes they come in their broad meaning, and they usually make sense if they come in their precise meaning or in their broad meaning. And sometimes the Torah clarifies things through certain superfluous words, etc. And several times, the noun is repeated to teach something. As when it repeats the noun <b>זכר</b> (male) to exclude the androgynous, because its broad meaning includes it. And it repeats <b>בבקר בבקר</b> (every morning)<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:5.</i> to mean <i>precisely morning</i>. And it depends on the majority usage of that noun; with the nouns זכר and בוקר, since they usually come in their broad meaning, we can presume that they come in their broad meaning.
And there are verbs that are usually used in the precise way, and through repeating the noun or the verb they are known to come in their broad meaning. As when it repeats the noun <b>קציר</b> (harvest) and the noun <b>שדה</b> (field). And moreover, with the nouns <b>בני ישראל</b> (children of Israel), <b>אדם</b> (man), <b>חצר אהל מועד</b> (courtyard of the Tent of Meeting), <b>ימים ונחלים</b> (seas and rivers), <b>בהמה</b> (animal) - they usually come in their precise meaning, and they need to have an amplificatory expression for them to come in their broad meaning.
And with the nouns <b>מזבח</b> (altar), <b>לידה</b> (delivery of a baby), <b>קרבן</b> (sacrifice) – I explained that they come in their broad meaning most of the time they are used in the Scripture and that there needs to be a special reason for one to conclude that they come in the precise meaning.

And we find several times that the Torah talks about one thing <i>for example</i>:
Like <b>תנור וכירים</b> יותץ (whether oven, or range for pots, it shall be broken in pieces)<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 11:35.</i>.
And moreover, with respect to the topic of plagues, any place where it uses the noun <b>בהרת</b> (bright spot) or <b>שאת</b>(rising), it means <i>for example</i>.
And moreover, the noun <b>בשר חי</b> (raw flesh); <b>שער שחור</b> (black hair).
And moreover, <b>חלבי השלמים</b> (fat of the peace-offerings).
And moreover, when it says at first a simple expression אשר יבוא עליו מים יטמא (that on which water comes, shall be unclean)<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 11:34.</i>, and afterwards the conditions are stipulated אשר ישתה בכל כלי (and all drink in every such vessel that may be drunk shall be unclean)<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>, we know that when it is written אשר ישתה, it means <i>for example</i>.
And moreover, with respect to warnings, we find that it uses as an example לא תקלל חרש (You shall not curse the deaf)<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 19:14.</i>, and the same applies for everyone.
And sometimes, it clarifies that the way of example comes, as when it is written בהמתך לא תרביע כלאים (You shall not let your cattle gender with a diverse kind)<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 19:19.</i>, and it adds את חוקותי תשמרו (You shall keep My statutes)<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>, to teach that it does not mean precisely cattle, and it does not mean precisely his cattle.
And we find that the Torah gives a warning <i>for example</i> to teach an explanation of a warning that comes in another place in the Torah. As when it gives a warning against eating a sacrifice outside of its time<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 19:5-7.</i>, so too the law applies against eating outside of its place, and it comes <i>for example</i> to clarify that which is written alone לא יחשב (neither shall it be imputed to him)<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:18.</i> - in other words, something that is similar to outside of its time - outside of its place.

Klal 91

And we find many times that the Torah uses the noun through which an action is done not to be precise, but <i>for example</i>. (like <b>והכה את רעהו באבן או באגרוף</b> (and one smite the other with a stone, or with his fist)<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 21:18.</i>, <b>כי יכה את עין עבדו בשבט</b> (And if a man smite his bondman, or his bondwoman, with a rod)<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 21:20.</i>, <b>לא תשחית את עצה לנדוח עליו גרזן</b> (you shall not destroy the trees thereof by wielding an axe against them)<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 20:19.</i>) and sometimes the noun comes precisely (like <b>והרים בקומצו</b> (And he shall take up therefrom his handful)<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:8.</i> and <b>והזה באצבעו</b> (and sprinkle it with his finger)<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:14.</i>).
And thus, when Rabbi Ishmael says that in three places, the law supersedes the Scripture<i>וכסהו בעפר</i> (cover it with dust)<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 17:13.</i>, <i>תער</i> (there shall no razor come upon his head)<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 6:5.</i>,<i>ספר</i> (bill of divorce)<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 24:1.</i>, מרצע (leper)<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:9.</i>, he means to say that the law is impossible to determine from the Scripture but only from the tradition, and the sages focus on these matters from the context of the Scripture.
And there is in this a difference between whether the noun precedes the verb – then it comes precisely, for instance, בעפר יכסהו, בתער יגלח, במרצע ירצע ,ספר יכתב - and when the verb comes first - then we are unable to determine if the noun comes precisely or <i>for example</i>.<br><br><i>Babylonian Talmud Sotah 16a says that Rabbi Ishmael says that in three places, the tradition supersedes the Scripture. The Malbim interprets Rabbi Ishmael as meaning that in each of these verses, the verb precedes the noun, so it is impossible to determine from the Scripture whether the noun comes precisely or for example. And the tradition is that in each of these verses, the noun comes for example<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Acharei Mot 120.</i>.</i>

Klal 92

And this is precisely in a place where it is possible to interpret that the noun through which the action is done comes <i>for example</i>. But in a place where the noun is right after the verb, like <b>ושרף באש</b> (and burn with fire)<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:12.</i>, and we do not know whether the noun <b>באש</b> comes in its precise meaning and it is precisely fire or it comes in its broad meaning and it includes even a wick of lead as a subcategory of fire, it will be the opposite. Whenever it says ושרף באש in which the noun באש comes to clarify the verb ושרף, it means precisely with fire. (Because the rule is that a noun that comes to clarify the verb always comes in its precise meaning.) But whenever it says באש תשרף (it shall be burnt with fire), the verb תשרף comes to clarify the noun באש – then it comes to include all types of burning that comes through fire. And moreover, it talks about this in the <i>Babylonian Talmud Pesachim</i> <i>75</i>.

Klal 93

And any place where the Scripture speaks in a way of division – as with the noun that comes after the word <b>אם</b> (if) which teaches about the division – the noun will never come in its precise meaning.
As when they interpret <b>אם עולה</b> (If his offering be a burnt-offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:3.</i> – to include an exchange. <b>אם כבש</b> (If he bring a lamb for his offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 3:7.</i> – to include a Passover offering.
And moreover, <b>אם נדר או נדבה</b> (But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a freewill-offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:16.</i>.
<b>אם בהרת</b> (And if the bright spot be white)<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:4.</i>.
And moreover, the noun איש (man) that comes after the word אם which comes as a condition – it will come in its broad meaning.
And moreover, the noun which comes after the word <b>או</b> that indicates the division – it also will not be precise and will include all that enter within the scope of the division, as is explained below in Rule 214.

Klal 94

And sometimes, it uses a noun as a novelty:
As when it is written וכל חטאת אשר יובא מדמה (And no sin-offering, whereof any of the blood is brought)<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:23.</i>, it means <i>even a sin offering</i>, and all the more so other types of offerings.
And moreover, when it is written עור העולה (the skin of the burnt-offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:8.</i>.
And moreover, when it is written את כספך לא תתן בנשך ובמרבית לא תתן אכלך (You shall not give him your money upon interest, nor give him your victuals for increase)<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 25:37.</i>, it uses both of them as novelties.
And moreover, when it is written נדבה תעשה אותו ולנדר לא ירצה (that may you offer for a freewill-offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted)<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 22:23.</i>, it means נדבה and <i>a fortiori </i>a נדר, and לנדר and <i>a fortiori </i>a נדבה.

Klal 95

And every place where a category name comes in construct state with a proper noun – like <b>זבח שלמים, זבח תודה, קרבן מנחה</b> etc., - there will always be a homiletical interpretation; and in most cases, <b>זבח שלמים</b> will also mean another slaughter that is similar to a peace-offering and<b>קרבן מנחה</b> will mean a sacrifice that is similar to a meal-offering: It intends to say that it does not speak about peace offerings as proper nouns (that they are peace offerings) but only as comprehensive categories (that they are slaughters and sacrifices) and that also for another type of slaughter and sacrifice this law applies.

Klal 96

There are many nouns in which when connected together create an intermediate concept. Like <b>מהומת מות</b>(deadly discomfiture), <b>מצרי שאול</b> (straits of the nether-world),<b>חרדת אלוקים</b> (terror from God). And moreover, the noun קול (voice) if it is connected to another noun afterwards - <b>קול פחדים</b> (sound of terrors), <b>קול מלחמה</b> (voice of war) – it will mean a voice that is similar to war. And moreover, ושמעה קול אלה (he hears the voice of adjuration)<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:1.</i> includes even an oath that is not an adjuration. And also on this foundation, many interpretations are understood from the compound nouns that I mentioned in the previous rule.

Klal 97

The Hebrew indicates the conditional of an expression in one of five ways:
1) With the word <b>כי</b> (if/when) - כי תקנה עבד עברי (If you buy a Hebrew servant)<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 21:2.</i>.
2) With the word <b>אם</b> (if) - אם תקריב מנחת ביכורים (And if you bring a meal-offering of first-fruits)<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 2:14.</i>.
3) With the word <b>אשר</b> (when) - אשר נשיא יחטא (When a ruler sins)<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:22.</i>.
4) The typical verb with the definite article הthat has the meaning of <a dir="rtl">אשר</a> - <b>המקריב</b> את זבח שלמיו להשם (He that offers his sacrifice of peace-offerings to the LORD)<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:29.</i>.
5) The infinitive with the prefix letter ב or <a dir="rtl">כ</a> - <b>בבואכם</b> אל הארץ (When you come into the land)<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 15:18.</i>.

Klal 98

There is a difference between the word <b>כי</b> and the word <b>אם</b>: The word כי comes at the beginning of the expression as a condition, while the wordאם comes in the specific divisions.
For example,אדם כי יקריב מכם קרבן...אם עולה קרבנו...ואם מן הצאן...ואם מן העוף (when any man of you brings an offering…if his offering be a burnt-offering…and if his offering be of the flock …and if his offering to the LORD be a burnt-offering of fowls)<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:2, 1:3, 1:10, 1:14.</i> – from this, the structure of a section is known so that any place where it begins with the word כי, it is a new topic, and whenever the word אם is said afterwards, they are the particulars of the section.<br><br><i>Leviticus 1:2 says,</i>דבר אל בני ישראל ואמרת אלהם אדם כי יקריב מכם קרבן ליהוה מן הבהמה מן הבקר ומן הצאן תקריבו את קרבנכם<i> (Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When any man of you brings an offering to the LORD, you shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd or of the flock), using the word כי for “when”.</i><br><br><i>Then Leviticus 1:3 says,</i>אם עלה קרבנו מן הבקר זכר תמים יקריבנו אל פתח אהל מועד יקריב אתו לרצנו לפני יהוה<i> (If his offering be a burnt-offering of the herd…), using the word אם for “if”.</i><br><br><i>And Leviticus 1:10 says, </i>ואם מן הצאן קרבנו מן הכשבים או מן העזים לעלה זכר תמים יקריבנו<i> (And if his offering be of the flock, whether of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-offering …), using the word אם for “if”.</i><br><br><i>And Leviticus 1:14 says, </i>ואם מן העוף עלה קרבנו ליהוה והקריב מן התרים או מן בני היונה את קרבנו<i> (And if his offering to the LORD be a burnt-offering of fowls…), using the word אם for “if”.</i><br><br><i>We see from this that the word כי comes at the beginning of the expression as a condition, while the wordאם comes in the specific divisions.</i>

Klal 99

And when it is written in the chapter that talks about provisional guilt offerings,<b>ואם</b> נפש <b>כי</b> תחטא (And if any one sin)<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:17.</i>, it is peculiar in language, that in addition to the fact that the word אם (if) is not correct (since it is a topic on its own and not a part of the previous section), the word כי which comes afterwards is very peculiar. And Rabbi Akiva learns from this that if one is uncertain whether he misused consecrated property, he should bring a provisional guilt offering; that with this comes the word אם to show that it is separate from the previous expressions<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:15-16.</i>, which talk about misused consecrated property. And afterwards, since it is an expression in and of itself, the word כי also comes.

Klal 100

And the reason for this is because the word אם (if) is a word of division. This is not the case with the word כי (when), which is similar to the word כאשר (when), that points out that it is a certainty; thus, it comes at the beginning of the expression and section. And the word אם comes in the particulars of the divisions. And in any place where the word אם comes, there will be a division, an uncertainty, and a possibility.
And when it is written ואם תקריב מנחת ביכורים (And if you bring a meal-offering of first-fruits to the LORD)<sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 2:14.</i>, it is peculiar in language, as it should say וכי תקריב. (Since also according to Rabbi Abraham Ben Meir Ibn Ezra, one cannot say that it is divided from the previous statement, because there is a rule that the word which is the foundation of the division is always right after the word אם – whether it is a noun or a verb – as it would have said ואם מנחת ביכורים תקריב.) And the sages of blessed memory explain that the word אם falls on a matter that has in it a possibility from the perspective of time; since in the future, the grain offering might be suspended (through exile) and subsequently be restored, and similarly for the Jubilee Year.<br><br><i>Leviticus 2:14 says, </i>ואם תקריב מנחת בכורים ליהוה אביב קלוי באש גרש כרמל תקריב את מנחת בכוריך<i> (And if you bring a meal-offering of first-fruits to the LORD, you shall bring for the meal-offering of your first-fruits corn in the ear parched with fire, even groats of the fresh ear), using the words </i>ואם תקריב מנחת ביכורים<i> for “And if you bring a meal-offering of first-fruits”. The foundation of the division appears to be </i>מנחת ביכורים<i> (meal-offering of first-fruits), since various other types of meal-offerings are referred to in Leviticus 2:1-13; hence, it appears that it should have said </i>ואם מנחת ביכורים תקריב<i>. The last sentence of Rule 100 explains otherwise<sup class="footnote-marker">205</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah ‘HaMitzvah Vayikra 148.</i>.</i>

Klal 101

The words<b>אם...אם</b> do not mean the same thing as בין...בין. And when it is writtenאם זכר אם נקבה (whether male or female)<sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 3:1.</i>, there is a homiletical interpretation.<br><br><i>Leviticus 3:1 says, </i>ואם זבח שלמים קרבנו אם מן הבקר הוא מקריב אם זכר אם נקבה תמים יקריבנו לפני יהוה<i> (And if his offering be a sacrifice of peace-offerings: if he offer of the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD), using the words אם זכר אם נקבה with the meaning of בין זכר בין נקבה (whether male or female). The homiletical interpretation is that</i>אם זכר<i> means any male, including the offspring, while </i>אם נקבה<i> means any female, including a substitute<sup class="footnote-marker">207</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah ‘HaMitzvah Vayikra 159.</i>.</i>

Klal 102

And in a conditional statement for which there are several hypotheses – the word אם will not come between any of the hypotheses before the conclusion. And when it is writtenאם לא יגיד (if he do not utter it)<sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:1.</i>, it is an exception to this rule, and there is a homiletical interpretation.<br><br><i>Leviticus 5:1 says,ונפש כי תחטא ושמעה קול אלה והוא עד או ראה או ידע אם לוא יגיד ונשא עונו (And if any one sin, in that he hears the voice of adjuration, he being a witness, whether he has seen or known, if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity), using the word אם in “if he do not utter it”, contradicting Rule 102. This is to teach that the condition אם לא יגיד is a new condition that is separate from the preceding conditions and that anyone who does not utter it shall bear his iniquity<sup class="footnote-marker">209</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 294.</i>.</i>

Klal 103

And there is a difference between the word <b>כי</b> that is in the beginning of a conditional statement and the word <b>אשר</b>: The word כי is a conditional conjunction, while the word אשר is a word that comes at the beginning of a phrase. And any place for which the conclusion of a conditional statement is an action that is independent of the subject – the word כי will come. And any place in which the conclusion involves the subject again, the word אשר will come, likeאשר יאכל כל דם ונכרת (Whosoever it be that eats any blood, that soul shall be cut off)<sup class="footnote-marker">210</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:27.</i>.
And any place that deviates from this rule and the wordאשר comes instead of כי, the sages of blessed memory will interpret the action in the conclusion to involve the subject. As when they interpret אשר יצוד ציד חיה ושפך את דמו וכסהו בעפר (that takes in hunting any beast or fowl that may be eaten, he shall pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust)<sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 17:13.</i> – <i>the one who slaughters covers</i>; and in this, the conclusion involves the subject.

Klal 104

And also, there is a difference between the word אשר when it indicates an attribute of a subject and the word כי when it indicates a future action:
And so any place where it wants to clarify that a matter is only applicable from here and onward – such as with צרעת (leprosy) and זיבה (issue), that the צרעת or זיבה that is before the speaking does not have a status of “unclean” – the word כי will come instead of אשר everywhere. And in a place where it means to say that even if this attribute were present long ago the judgement will be applicable – as when it is written אשר יהיה בו מום (Whosoever he be of your seed throughout their generations that has a blemish)<sup class="footnote-marker">212</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 21:17.</i> – the word אשר will be used.<br><br><i>Leviticus 12:2 says, דבר אל בני ישראל לאמר אשה כי תזריע וילדה זכר וטמאה שבעת ימים כימי נדת דותה תטמא (Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: If a woman be delivered, and bear a man-child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of the impurity of her sickness shall she be unclean), using the word כי. According to Rule 104, this indicates that if a woman delivers a boy before Moses tells this law to the children of Israel, the law will not apply<sup class="footnote-marker">213</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Tazria 2.</i>.</i>

Klal 105

And when it is written אשר נשיא יחטא (When a ruler sins)<sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:22.</i>, the word אשר comes in place of the word אם. And there is a difference between them in that when the word אשר comes with the meaning of אם, it indicates that He wants the matter to be true, as when it is writtenאת הברכה <b>אשר</b> תשמעו..והקללה <b>אם לא</b> תשמעו (the blessing, if you shall listen to the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day; and the curse, if you shall not listen to the commandments of the LORD your God)<sup class="footnote-marker">215</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 11:27-28.</i>.<br><br><i>If the word אשר comes when God wants the matter to be true, then why does it come in the verse Leviticus 4:22, which says </i>אשר נשיא יחטא ועשה אחת מכל מצות יהוה אלהיו אשר לא תעשינה בשגגה ואשם<i> (When a ruler sins, and does through error any one of all the things which the LORD his God has commanded not to be done, and is guilty)? Does God want a ruler to sin? The answer is no, God does not want a ruler to sin, but if a ruler does sin, God wants him to bring an offering, which he is commanded to bring in the next verse. And this is why the Torah uses the word אשר in this verse<sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 257.</i>.</i>

Klal 106

And the typical verb with a definite article ה that comes at the beginning of a conditional expression – the ה will have the meaning of אשר (that/which), only that it also indicates that even though it is a conditional ה, it is also a definite article. But the word אשר indicates that it is indefinite.<br><br><i>Leviticus 6:2 says,צו את אהרן ואת בניו לאמר זאת תורת העלה הוא העלה על מוקדה על המזבח כל הלילה עד הבקר ואש המזבח תוקד בו (Command Aaron and his sons, saying: This is the law of the burnt-offering: it is that which goes up on its firewood upon the altar all night unto the morning; and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning thereby), using the language העלה על מוקדה for “that which goes up”.

Klal 107

And all four of these words and prefixes teach about permission, not about obligation, except for the fifth prefix – the ה which accompanies the infinitive – it will come in one of three ways:
1) Sometimes it indicates the persistence of time, like בבואם אל אוהל מועד (when they go into the tent of meeting)<sup class="footnote-marker">218</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 30:20.</i>.
2) To instruct about the frequency - בבואכם אל הארץ (when you come into the land)<sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 15:18.</i>.
If the action of the circumstance is a necessity, whether from nature or from an obligation in the Torah.<br><br><i>There is probably a typographical error here. The Malbim clearly meant the the prefix letter ב or כ, not the prefix letter ה. See Rule 97.</i>

Klal 108

And in all of the Book of Leviticus and the Book of Numbers, whenever it talks about commandments between man and God – the noun always precedes the word כי (the conditional conjunction) that comes afterwards - <b>אדם כי</b> יקריב (When any man of you brings)<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:2.</i>. This is not so with the chapter of Statutory Laws (in the Book of Exodus) and Book of Deuteronomy where it talks about laws between man and man – it will always say כי יכה איש (And if a man smite)<sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 21:26.</i> or כי ישאל איש (And if a man borrow)<sup class="footnote-marker">222</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 22:13.</i>.

Klal 109

And the rule of the language is that the word אשר (which is called a <i>הכינוי המצרף</i> - literally <i>a connecting pronoun</i>) always needs to be written next to the noun that connects to it without break - והאבן הזאת אשר שמתי מצבה יהיה בית אלוקים (and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house)<sup class="footnote-marker">223</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 28:22.</i>. And any place that is an exception to this rule is a word which implies reason, not connection. Or the sages of blessed memory will explain and answer through a homiletical interpretation like המזבח סביב אשר פתח אהל מועד (round about against the altar that is at the door of the tent of meeting)<sup class="footnote-marker">224</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:5.</i> – they explain that the word סביב (round about against) modifies the word המזבח (the altar).

Klal 110

And it is not the way of the Scripture to repeat the word אשר, unless the second אשר limits the first אשר and comes without the letter ו. Like <b>אשר</b> יגור בתוכם‏ <b>אשר</b> יעלה עולה או זבח (that sojourn among them, that offer a burnt-offering or sacrifice)<sup class="footnote-marker">225</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 17:8.</i>.
And besides this, the word אשר only comes on the first condition, likeאשר היא מפרסת פרסה ושסע איננה שוסעת (which parts the hoof, but is not cloven footed, nor chews the cud)<sup class="footnote-marker">226</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 11:26.</i>. And from this, it is proven that when it is written הכהן <b>אשר</b> ימשח אותו <b>ואשר</b> ימלא את ידו (And the priest, who shall be anointed and who shall be consecrated to be priest in his father's stead)<sup class="footnote-marker">227</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:32.</i>, the letter ו means <i>or</i>. And it is interpreted <i>או אשר</i> (or that), that with this comes the word אשר repeated, likeאשר ישחט במחנה או אשר ישחט חוץ למחנה (that kills an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that kills it without the camp)<sup class="footnote-marker">228</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 17:3.</i>.

Klal 111

It is the custom of the language such that in a definitive statement, the verb will always precede the noun. [<b>וידבר ה', וילך אברהם</b>, וכדומה]. (And God spoke, and Abraham went).
And any place where the noun precedes the verb, it intends to clarify a certain limitation that is placed upon the noun - הכהן ומלק (the priest shall bring it to the altar, and pinch off its head)<sup class="footnote-marker">229</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:15.</i> – the priest himself.
Or it will mean a certain inconsistency and contrast between this noun and the noun before it, as when it is written ואת אשמו יביא (And he shall bring his forfeit to the LORD)<sup class="footnote-marker">230</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:25.</i> – it means a certain contrast between the law of the guilt offering and the law of the one-fifth payment.
Or it will mean a certain limitation in order to make things precise. ואל בני ישראל תאמר (Moreover, you shall say to the children of Israel)<sup class="footnote-marker">231</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 20:2.</i> – to exclude idol worshippers.

Klal 112

And moreover, in a sentence that is said by way of contrast and inconsistency with the sentence that comes before it, if the foundation of the inconsistency is the obligation and the difference in obligation is between the nouns, then the noun will come first - לנכרי תשיך ולאחיך לא תשיך (To a foreigner you may lend upon interest; but to your brother you shall not lend upon interest)<sup class="footnote-marker">232</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 23:21.</i>.
And moreover, whenever the noun comes first, as in קרבן ראשית תקריבו (As an offering of first-fruits you may bring them)<sup class="footnote-marker">233</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 2:12.</i> and it does not say והקרבתם קרבן ראשית – this clarifies that it is not commandment on its own, but only a statement which indicates that the previous sentence does not apply to קרבן ראשית (an offering of first-fruits).

Klal 113

And moreover, if an expression comes by way of division and the foundation of the division is between the nouns – the noun that is the foundation of the division will always come first. And from this, it is proven that when it is written וכלי חרש אשר תבושל בו (But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken)<sup class="footnote-marker">234</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:21.</i> in which the noun כלי חרש is first, it is clarified that it is a division from that which precedes it – he washes the garment, and he breaks the earthen vessel.<br><br><i>See Rule 114 for an explanation.</i>

Klal 114

And expressions only come by way of division if they are alike in one matter (in the noun or in the verb) and different in another matter. And the sentences will never be fully divided, whether with a noun or with a verb.
And from this, it is proven that when it is written וכלי חרש אשר תבושל בו (But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden)<sup class="footnote-marker">235</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>, it means <i>אשר תבלע בו</i> (wherein it is sodden) - that according to this, the garment and the earthenware vessel are similar in the verb, and differ only between the nouns; that a soiled garment shall be washed and a sodden earthenware vessel shall be broken. Not so if it would have meant תבושל (cooking) literally, as then they would also differ in the verb and not come by way of a division at all and it would be proper that the verb comes first, as with all expressions that stand on their own.<br><br><i>Leviticus 6:20-21 says,</i>כל אשר יגע בבשרה יקדש ואשר יזה מדמה על הבגד אשר יזה עליה תכבס במקום קדש. וכלי חרש אשר תבשל בו ישבר ואם בכלי נחשת בשלה ומרק ושטף במים<i> (Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy; and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, you shall wash that whereon it was sprinkled in a holy place. But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken; and if it be sodden in a brazen vessel, it shall be scoured, and rinsed in water), using the word </i>בגד<i> for “garment” and the words </i>כלי חרס<i> for “earthen vessel”.</i><br><br><i>In both sentences, the noun comes before the verb; therefore, the two sentences come by way of division between </i>בגד<i> and </i>כלי חרס<i>. Hence, by Rule 114, they must be alike in the verb. The only way in which this is possible is if the word </i>תבושל<i> is interpreted as “sodden”<sup class="footnote-marker">236</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Tzav 68.</i>.</i>

Klal 115

And moreover, the noun can be first in order to inform of a connection between two sentences. And this will be in a place where the noun which is the subject in the second sentence is the direct object in the sentence that precedes it. Like וימכור את בכורתו ליעקב...ויעקב נתן לעשו (And he sold his birthright to Jacob… and Jacob gave Esau)<sup class="footnote-marker">237</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 25:33-34.</i> or בכל כוחי עבדתי את אביכן...ואביכן התל בי (with all my power I have served your father...and your father has mocked me)<sup class="footnote-marker">238</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 31:6-7.</i>.

Klal 116

Sometimes the noun comes first to teach that the verb does not come precisely and that the noun alone is primary. (שדך לא תזרע (you shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed)<sup class="footnote-marker">239</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 19:19.</i> – the warning about the field is primary, not the sowing – also when one is not sowing, only maintaining, it is prohibited.) And if the verb comes first, sometimes the noun does not come precisely.
And moreover, the noun will precede the verb in the conclusion of a conditional statement -מן הבהמה תקריבו (you shall bring your offering of the cattle)<sup class="footnote-marker">240</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:2.</i> מלחם אביה תאכל (she may eat of her father's bread)<sup class="footnote-marker">241</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 22:13.</i>.

Klal 117

And all of this is with respect to expressions that are organized and consecutive, one after another in time. But when it comes to talk about a matter that already happened before that time – the noun will always precede the verb. As when <i>Rashi</i> interprets the verse והאדם ידע (And the man knew)<sup class="footnote-marker">242</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 4:1.</i> and וה' פקד את שרה (And the LORD remembered Sarah)<sup class="footnote-marker">243</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 21:1.</i> and ואל משה אמר (And to Moses He said)<sup class="footnote-marker">244</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 24:1.</i>.
And moreover they interpret את חקותי תשמרו (You shall keep My statutes)<sup class="footnote-marker">245</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 19:19.</i> – statutes that were from the beginning.

Klal 118

And for verbs that come with one subject – it is the custom of the language for the noun to come in between the two verbs, like ויגדל הילד ויגמל (And the child grew, and was weaned)<sup class="footnote-marker">246</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 21:8.</i>.
And in a place where the noun comes after two verbs – this is unusual in the language, and the sages of blessed memory will always interpret the two verbs adjacent to one another to be alike in a certain matter or that they occur at the same time.

Klal 119

In an expression in which the subject and the object are mentioned explicitly – the object will never precede the subject, and there will always be a homiletical interpretation when this rule is violated, as when the sages of blessed memory interpret when it is written,כאכל קש לשון אש (as the tongue of fire devours the stubble)<sup class="footnote-marker">247</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 5:24.</i>, אבנים שחקו מים (The waters wear the stones)<sup class="footnote-marker">248</sup><i class="footnote">Job 14:19.</i>, and when it is written ויקרא אל משה..השם (and the LORD called to Moses, and spoke to him)<sup class="footnote-marker">249</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:1.</i>.

Klal 120

Two verbs which act on one direct object – if the two actions are consecutive – the direct object will come after the two verbs. And if not, then the direct object will come in between the two verbs.

Klal 121

Two nouns that come one after another – whether they are subjects or objects – presumably their order is precise, and the first will precede the second in deed or in merit.

Klal 122

And whenever two nouns come in one place in a certain order and in another place the latter precedes to the former, it comes to teach that both are equal; nevertheless, there will be a reason for the whole organization.

Klal 123

Any place where two verbs come and the direct object follows afterwards – presumably the last verb acts on the direct object.

Klal 124

And all prepositions that come as an adverb after the direct object to limit the place – they will not limit the subject, only the direct object.
ושחט את בן הבקר לפני (And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD)<sup class="footnote-marker">250</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:5.</i> – and not the killer before the LORD.
וזרקו את הדם על המזבח (and dash the blood round about against the altar)<sup class="footnote-marker">251</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i> – and not the dasher of the blood against the altar.

Klal 125

And there is a difference between whether the verbs are next to one another by way of a verb (like כי יחטא ועשה - when he sins and does) or the second verb comes by way of an infinitive connected to the first through one of the four prefixes <b>בכל"ם</b> (like תחטא בעשותה) – then there will be a connection between the two verbs, and the first will depend on the infinitive as either an effect from a cause or through a connection in time. Like וקדשת את המזבח <b>בכפרך</b> (and you shall do the purification upon the altar when you make atonement for it)<sup class="footnote-marker">252</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 29:36.</i> and<b>בבואם</b> אל אוהל מועד ירחצו מים (when they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water)<sup class="footnote-marker">253</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 30:20.</i>.

Klal 126

And a verb that is connected with another verb through the prefix ב that is used with an infinitive – then the verb that comes as an infinitive is usually previous in time to the verb that is connected with it, as when it is written במשוך היובל המה יעלו בהר (when the ram's horn sounds long, they shall come up to the mount)<sup class="footnote-marker">254</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 19:13.</i> – it means they shall come up to the mount after the ram’s horn sounds long. Or it will teach that it was <i>this</i> and in time it will be <i>this</i>.

Klal 127

The prefix letter ל that is used with the infinitive in most cases teaches about the preparation of a matter - ויצאו <b>ללכת</b> ארצה כנען (and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan)<sup class="footnote-marker">255</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 11:31.</i>. When referring to the instrument with which one performs an action, the prefix ב is proper. And when it is written לבטא בשפתים (clearly with his lips)<sup class="footnote-marker">256</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:4.</i>, it was proper to say בביטוי שפתים, and there is a homiletical interpretation.<br><br><i>Leviticus 5:4 says,או נפש כי תשבע לבטא בשפתים להרע או להיטיב לכל אשר יבטא האדם בשבעה ונעלם ממנו והוא ידע ואשם לאחת מאלה (or if any one swear clearly with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly with an oath, and it be hid from him; and, when he knows of it, be guilty in one of these things), using לבטא בשפתים for “clearly with his lips”. If it had used the language בביטוי שפתים instead, one might have thought that it was also referring to someone who utters an oath but did not mean it in his heart; the language לבטא בשפתים teaches otherwise<sup class="footnote-marker">257</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 311.</i>.</i>

Klal 128

The infinitive with the prefix ל – sometimes teaches about the thought alone and sometimes teaches about the thought and the deed, like להרגו בערמה (to slay him with guile)<sup class="footnote-marker">258</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 21:14.</i> – <i>and slay him</i>; לשכב את בת יעקב (because he had wrought a vile deed in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter)<sup class="footnote-marker">259</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 34:7.</i> – <i>and lying with</i>.
And from this, a disagreement develops between Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon when it is written לכפר בקדש (to make atonement in the holy place)<sup class="footnote-marker">260</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:23.</i>, whether it means that it is a real atonement or it means that he wants to make an atonement.
And when it is written לא תקרבו לגלות ערוה (None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness)<sup class="footnote-marker">261</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 18:6.</i>, there is a disagreement as to whether approaching is also prohibited or it only prohibits לגלות (to uncover), which is the opinion of Rabbi Eleazar ben Pedat.

Klal 129

And sometimes the infinitive comes without a pronoun - לבלתי <b>עשות</b> מחוקות התועבות (that you do not any of these abominable customs)<sup class="footnote-marker">262</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 18:30.</i>, <b>בהפך</b> את הערים (when He overthrew the cities)<sup class="footnote-marker">263</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 19:29.</i>; therefore, whenever it comes with a pronoun, <b>בעשותה</b> אחת (in doing any of the things)<sup class="footnote-marker">264</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:27.</i>, <b>בשבתך בביתך</b> (when you sit in your house)<sup class="footnote-marker">265</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 6:7.</i> – there will be a homiletical interpretation.<br><br><i>Leviticus 4:27 says, </i>ואם נפש אחת תחטא בשגגה מעם הארץ בעשתה אחת ממצות יהוה אשר לא תעשינה ואשם<i> (And if any one of the common people sin through error, in doing any of the things which the LORD has commanded not to be done, and be guilty). The infinitive </i>בעשתה<i> (in doing) has a pronoun in order to indicate that the verse is only talking about a person who sins on his own, not a person who sins on account of a Jewish court mistakenly telling him to sin<sup class="footnote-marker">266</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 278.</i>.</i>

Klal 130

The infinitive with the letter ל that is connected to a verb teaches a diminution and a boundary: לא <b>תלמד לעשות</b> (you shall not learn to do)<sup class="footnote-marker">267</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 18:9.</i> – <i>but you may learn to teach</i>. And moreover, it will come to limit the first verb: כי <b>תחל לזנות</b> (if she profanes herself by playing the harlot)<sup class="footnote-marker">268</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 21:9.</i>, do not interpret it to mean that she profanes herself with any profanity other than harlotry.

Klal 131

The Scripture only adds an adjective to a noun when necessary. And any adjective which modifies a noun that is recognized without it is superfluous, and there will be a homiletical interpretation.

Klal 132

And moreover, any place where two adjectives come to modify one thing, we can conclude that one adjective is not enough (like <b>עבד עברי</b> Hebrew servant, <b>מזבח הזהב</b> golden altar, <b>עגל מסכה</b> molten calf). And in a place where one is enough, the other will be superfluous. Thus, when it is written, ולקח הכהן המשיח מדם הפר (And the anointed priest shall take of the blood of the bullock)<sup class="footnote-marker">269</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:5.</i>, they interpret משיח (anointed) to mean “high”; that if it were literal, then the noun משיח would be enough alone. On the contrary, when it is written אם הכהן המשיח יחטא (if the anointed priest shall sin)<sup class="footnote-marker">270</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:3.</i>, the noun משיח is not enough, since one could err and interpret this to mean that he is the king.
And moreover, any place where an adjective is superfluous, there will be a homiletical interpretation.

Klal 133

And moreover, if the ordinal number of an object comes, then another specifier (of the object) is not necessary. And if another specifier comes, the ordinal number is not necessary. And if both come, there will be a homiletical interpretation, as when it is written, ויקרב את האיל השני איל המילואים (And the other ram was presented, the ram of consecration)<sup class="footnote-marker">271</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 8:22.</i>.<br><br><i>When Leviticus 8:22 says</i>ויקרב את האיל השני איל המלאים <i>(And the other ram was presented, the ram of consecration), it says the ordinal number השני (the other) in order to teach that it was necessary that there be two rams<sup class="footnote-marker">272</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Tzav 183.</i>.</i>

Klal 134

And moreover, if the special pronoun <b>אשר</b> (that/which) is added, it must add new information about that which was mentioned first. And if not, then it is superfluous, and the word אשר will indicate the reason. And the same applies for every superfluous word; as with any place where it says <b>מבשר הזבח</b> (of the flesh of the sacrifice), the word בשר is superfluous.

Klal 135

And any place where it explains the reason at the end of a statement (like <b>עולה היא, מנחה היא, חטאת היא, ק" ק היא, צרעת היא, מספחת היא, שבת היא, יוה"כ היא</b> etc.), there will always be two homiletical interpretations which address the following issues:
a) About the superfluous words - in all of these places, it is clarified in the details that it is talking about the laws of a burnt offering or a gift offering or leprosy etc., so why does it add this information a second time?
b) The word <b>היא</b> is also superfluous, since in many places it drops the word <b>היא</b> (like קודש קודשים מאישי השם, אשה להשם, שבת שבתון מקרא קודש).
And the homiletical interpretations of the sages of blessed memory can be divided into many types:
Sometimes, it is interpreted that it means to say <i>עולה היא</i> - even if it misses a certain detail, it is nevertheless a burnt offering, while the word הוא informs of the opposite – precisely as was specified. And there is an amplification and a restriction – that it amplifies a thing and restricts a thing.
And sometimes they interpret that it comes to say that the judgement that is said is not a special judgement in this place alone; rather, it is a general judgement with respect to burnt and gift offerings, and the same applies for every burnt offering and for every gift offering. But the word הוא informs of the opposite – only here and nowhere else – and there is an amplification and a restriction.

Klal 136

It is because of the elegance of the language that it will not repeat a noun each time: After it is mentioned the first time, if it is a subject, all of the predicates will imply it. And if it is a direct object, it will be implied to through a pronoun (like <b>ושחט אותו</b> - and slaughter it, <b>והזה עליו</b> - and sprinkle upon it, <b>ושחטו</b> - and slaughter it). And this is a rule in all languages. Thus, any place where a noun is repeated unnecessarily, whether it is a subject or an object – there will always be a homiletical interpretation. And these homiletical interpretations will be in several ways.

Klal 137

Sometimes they interpret the repetition of a noun to mean <i>precisely the same noun</i>, not some other thing that one might mistakenly think it is.
As when it is written מסולת המנחה (of the fine flour of the meal-offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">273</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:8.</i> – not another meal-offering that gets mixed up with it.
את הפר (the bullock)<sup class="footnote-marker">274</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:4.</i> – not something exchanged for it.
על ראש הפר (upon the head of the bullock)<sup class="footnote-marker">275</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:15.</i> – to exclude goats brought for idol worship.
מדמה (of the blood thereof)<sup class="footnote-marker">276</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:20.</i> – and not of the sauce.

And moreover, there are four interpretations for the four extra times the noun <b>הזב</b> (has the issue)<sup class="footnote-marker">277</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 15:4.</i> is mentioned, in order to exclude four things.<br><br><i>When הזב is mentioned four times in Leviticus 15:4, 15:6, 15:8, and 15:9, they appear to be superfluous. But the reason for these repetitions is to teach that the Torah means precisely הזב and not four other things that one might mistakenly think fall within the scope of these four sentences<sup class="footnote-marker">278</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Metzora 130.</i>.</i>

Klal 138

And many times, the sages of blessed memory interpret that a repeated noun is not the first noun literally.
As when they interpret <i>והקריבו את הדם, וזרקו את הדם</i> (And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD; and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall present the blood, and dash the blood)<sup class="footnote-marker">279</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:5.</i> – even if it is spilled from the vessel onto the floor. Perhaps even if it is spilled from the neck of an animal onto the floor? The word <i>הדם</i> teaches otherwise. It means to say that since it does not say וזרקוהו with a pronoun, it is implied that it is another noun, that it is not the blood that was dashed, which is the blood in the vessel. However, the custom of the language is such that the new noun that was not mentioned should come without a definite article ה (and as I explained it, the ה indicates the noun that was already mentioned and known) and hence it is proven that from one perspective, it is blood that was mentioned – that it was received in a vessel, and from another perspective it is different blood, since it was spilled from the vessel.
And moreover, the sages interpret like this when it is written, ראש העולה (head of the burnt-offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">280</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:4.</i>.
והפשיט את העולה (And he shall flay the burnt-offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">281</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:6.</i>.
ואש המזבח (the fire of the altar)<sup class="footnote-marker">282</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:2.</i> – another altar.
עור העולה (skin of the burnt-offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">283</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:8.</i> – even if it is not a burnt-offering of a man.
ושרפת את הנותר (you shall burn the remainder)<sup class="footnote-marker">284</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 29:34.</i> – all of the remainder.
והיה במקום השחין (and in the place of the boil)<sup class="footnote-marker">285</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:19.</i> – another boil.
והנה אין בבהרת (and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot)<sup class="footnote-marker">286</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:26.</i> – another bright spot.
נרפא הנתק (the scall is healed)<sup class="footnote-marker">287</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:37.</i> – another scall.
כי פשה הנגע (if the plague be spread)<sup class="footnote-marker">288</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:51.</i> – another plague.

Klal 139

And like this, they interpret as well that the repeated noun will come to include another thing that is similar to it.
As they interpreted והבאת את המנחה (And you shall bring the meal-offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">289</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 2:8.</i> – to include all of the meal offerings.
וסמך על ראש הפר (and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the bullock)<sup class="footnote-marker">290</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:4.</i> – to include the bullock of <i>Yom Kippur</i>.
על דם הפר (blood of the bullock)<sup class="footnote-marker">291</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:7.</i>.
חלב פר החטאת (fat of the bullock of the sin-offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">292</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:8.</i>.
ועשה לפר (Thus shall he do with the bullock)<sup class="footnote-marker">293</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:20.</i>.
ראש השעיר (head of the goat)<sup class="footnote-marker">294</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:24.</i>.
ושחט את החטאת (and kill the sin-offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">295</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:29.</i> – to include all sin offerings.
על ראש החטאת (upon the head of the sin-offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">296</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>.
פר חטאת (the bullock of the sin-offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">297</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:27.</i>.
And also these explanations are understood with respect to the previous rule, that the noun that is repeated is not literally the first noun, that if so it would not have repeated it for no reason and it would have been indicated through a pronoun.
And moreover, when it is written ויצא הכהן..וראה הכהן (And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look)<sup class="footnote-marker">298</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:3.</i> – they interpret this to be another priest.
ויצק על כף הכהן (and pour it into the palm of his own left hand)<sup class="footnote-marker">299</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:15.</i> – the palm of another priest.
And ובת איש כהן (And the daughter of any priest)<sup class="footnote-marker">300</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 21:9.</i>.
And moreover, when it begins with a new topic, the repeated noun is different. That from this, it is proven that when it is written ושור או שה אותו ואת בנו (And whether it be cow or ewe, you shall not kill it and its young both in one day)<sup class="footnote-marker">301</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 22:28.</i> – it is speaking about unconsecrated animals.

Klal 140

And sometimes it will repeat the noun to divide an expression or to make another sentence. And it will be that if a certain condition is mentioned first and it wants to teach that <i>ex post facto</i> the condition is unnecessary, the noun will be repeated so that the verb will be read with the noun afterwards as a statement on its own that does not depend on the previous statement.
Like אביב קלוי באש גרש כרמל תקריב את מנחת בכוריך (you shall bring for the meal-offering of your first-fruits corn in the ear parched with fire, even groats of the fresh ear)<sup class="footnote-marker">302</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 2:14.</i>. The noun מנחת בכוריך (the meal-offering of your first-fruits) is added, so that it is read when it is written תקריב את מנחת בכוריך as a separate and independent expression, to say even if the condition אביב קלוי באש גרש כרמל is not satisfied, one should nevertheless bring a meal-offering of his first-fruits.
And moreover when it is written את אזכרתה (the memorial-part)<sup class="footnote-marker">303</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 2:2.</i>.

Klal 141

And sometimes it is necessary to repeat the noun, since two nouns come and if it speaks with a pronoun, one will not know which noun the pronoun refers to.
Like ומראה הנגע (And the priest shall look upon the plague in the skin of the flesh; and if the hair in the plague be turned white, and the <b>appearance of the plague</b> be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is the plague of leprosy; and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean)<sup class="footnote-marker">304</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:3.</i>, that if it would have said ומראהו (appearance of it) with a pronoun, it would be misleading, since one could interpret it to mean the white hair.
And it said והנה הנגע עמד בעיניו (and behold if the plague stay in its appearance)<sup class="footnote-marker">305</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:5.</i> - do not interpret it to mean the bright spot (that was mentioned in the previous sentence).
And moreover it says פרוח תפרח הצרעת וכסתה הצרעת (if the leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of him)<sup class="footnote-marker">306</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:12.</i> - do not interpret it to mean the rising (that was mentioned in the previous sentence).

Klal 142

And sometimes it repeats the noun for other teachings.
As with respect to quarantine, with any first quarantine, it says והסגיר את הנגע (then the priest shall shut up him that has the plague)<sup class="footnote-marker">307</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:4.</i>, since the plague will remain anyway when he will need a second quarantine.
And when it is written אשר יגע במשכבו (And whosoever touches his bed)<sup class="footnote-marker">308</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 15:5.</i>, there is a homiletical interpretation.
וכי ירוק...בטהור (And if he that has the issue spit upon him that is clean)<sup class="footnote-marker">309</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 15:8.</i>.<br><br><i>Leviticus 13:4 says,</i>ואם בהרת לבנה הוא בעור בשרו ועמק אין מראה מן העור ושערה לא הפך לבן והסגיר הכהן את הנגע שבעת ימים<i> (And if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white, then the priest shall shut up him that has the plague seven days), using the words והסגיר את הנגע for “then the priest shall shut up him that has the plague”. The word הנגע (the plague) is superfluous, since it could use the word </i>והסגירו<i> and the reader would understand that the pronoun means “the plague”, from the previous verse. This is to teach that it is only talking about the first seven days of quarantine<sup class="footnote-marker">310</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Tazria 59.</i>.</i>

Klal 143

And sometimes it is repeated in order to teach that the noun is precise:
ואת החלב אשר עליהן (and the fat that is on them)<sup class="footnote-marker">311</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 3:4.</i> – and not the meat.
וראה את הנגע (And the priest shall look upon the plague)<sup class="footnote-marker">312</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:3.</i> - that his eyes should be on the plague itself.
על המטהר מן הצרעת (And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy)<sup class="footnote-marker">313</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:7.</i> – and not him that is to be cleansed from the uncleanness of a dead body.
ולקח למטהר (to take for him that is to be cleansed)<sup class="footnote-marker">314</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:4.</i> – for all that is to be cleansed.
עצים על האש (and lay wood in order upon the fire)<sup class="footnote-marker">315</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:7.</i> – and not fire upon wood.
And moreover, a noun that is repeated several times or in another place will come precisely:
As it explains when it is written three times והנותרת מן המנחה (But that which is left of the meal-offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">316</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 2:3.</i>.
And three times לפני אהל מועד (before the tent of meeting)<sup class="footnote-marker">317</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 3:8.</i>.
And two times מנחה חדשה (new meal-offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">318</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 23:16.</i>.

Klal 144

Or it is repeated in order to compare the two mentions of the noun to each other.
ונמצה על קיר המזבח (And the priest shall bring it to the altar, and pinch off its head, and make it smoke on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be drained out on the side of the altar)<sup class="footnote-marker">319</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:15.</i> – המזבח (altar) is repeated in order to compare המזבח with respect to smoke to המזבח with respect to draining; just as smoke is above, so is draining. And it is clarified later in Rule 159 and Rule 160.

Klal 145

And sometimes it is repeated to teach that it is not according to its simple meaning. But rather, if that noun usually comes in its broad meaning – it is repeated to teach that it comes in its precise meaning. And if it usually comes in its precise meaning – it is repeated to teach that it comes in its broad meaning.

Klal 146

And notice that the sages of blessed memory in all of the chapter about ritual impurity give interpretations for the superfluous nouns and repetitions in the section about the afflictions of clothes:
The noun <b>בגד</b> is repeated there eight times.
The noun <b>עור</b> and the noun <b>שתי וערב</b> are both repeated seven times.
The noun <b>פשתים וצמר</b> is repeated three times.
And the sages of blessed memory give homiletical interpretions, and the number of homiletical interpretations equals the number of superfluous words, in the wisdom and spirit of God. And the Law of God is perfect, restoring the soul<sup class="footnote-marker">320</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 19:8.</i>.

Klal 147

And a noun that comes twice and needs to come in construct state – it comes the first time in construct state and the second time with the definite article ה, since in the beginning, it clarifies its nature through construct state and afterwards it is already known, so it comes with a definite article, and never the reverse.
Thus, ועלתה יבמתו אל <b>הזקנים</b> וקראו לו <b>זקן עירו</b> (then his brother's wife shall go up to the gate to the elders, and say: ‘My husband's brother refuses to raise up to his brother a name in Israel; he will not perform the duty of a husband's brother to me.’ Then the elders of his city shall call him)<sup class="footnote-marker">321</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 25:7-8.</i> is not in accordance with the rules of the language. And from this, the sages of blessed memory are forced to conclude that when it is written זקני עירו (elders of his city) it is intended to mean other elders that are in the city.
And the same applies when it comes the first time with the letter ה and the second time without the letter ה - it will be another noun.
And when it is written והבשר כל טהור יאכל בשר (And the flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire. And as for the flesh, every one that is clean may eat thereof)<sup class="footnote-marker">322</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:19.</i>, it is peculiar in language, and there is a homiletical interpretation.
And moreover, it is proven that when it is written והנותר בשמן (And the rest of the oil)<sup class="footnote-marker">323</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:18.</i>, it is not a definite article ה, in which it would definitely remain; rather it is a conditional ה – <i>if it remains</i> - since in the previous verse, it says ומיתר השמן(and of the rest of the oil)<sup class="footnote-marker">324</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:17.</i> without a ה – that it is not for certain that it remains and all the more so it is not correct to place a definite article on נותר in the next verse.

Klal 148

And also, in a place where it is necessary to repeat the second noun for reasons that were said before – it will only repeat the particular noun, not any category noun that is attached to it. And if both are repeated, there will be a special homiletical interpretation. As when they interpret:
את מנחת ביכוריך(meal-offering of your first-fruits)<sup class="footnote-marker">325</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 2:14.</i>,
על זבח התודה (with the sacrifice of thanksgiving)<sup class="footnote-marker">326</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:12.</i>,
זבח תודת שלמיו (sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving)<sup class="footnote-marker">327</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:13.</i>.

Klal 149

Sometimes the noun is repeated for calling - אברהם אברהם (Abraham Abraham) משה משה (Moses Moses) or to teach a law - איש איש (any man).
And any place where the verb is mentioned alone at the beginning and afterwards is mentioned with a noun, at the beginning was an impersonal subject.<br><br><i>Leviticus 1:5 says,ושחט את בן הבקר לפני יהוה והקריבו בני אהרן הכהנים את הדם וזרקו את הדם על המזבח סביב אשר פתח אהל מועד (And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD; and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall present the blood, and dash the blood round about against the altar that is at the door of the tent of meeting), in which the verb is mentioned alone at the beginning and afterwards the verb is mentioned with a noun. According to Rule 149, this means that the noun at the beginning was an impersonal subject, implying that the killing of the bullock does not have to be done by a priest<sup class="footnote-marker">328</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 35.</i>.</i>

Klal 150

Any places where it refers to the object through a pronoun, it will come in one of two ways:
Sometimes, they will refer to it through a pronoun alone - <b><a dir="rtl">והקריבו, ושחטו, והקטירו, והקטירם, והביאה.</a></b>
And sometimes, they will refer to it through a pronoun that is attached to the word את - <b><a dir="rtl">ושחט אותו, והקריב אותם, והקטיר אותם.</a></b>
And all who believe in the holiness of our Torah and the splendor of the Holy Tongue understand that it is impossible that this matter will be by accident in accordance with the will of its Author. So if it is able to indicate the pronoun through the letter ו alone, then why does it add the word את?
And the sages of blessed memory considered and researched and found homiletical interpretations in every place where the pronoun is attached to the word את. And they summarized the interpretation in every place with one rule: Any place where it refers to the direct object in an ordinary way – it will do so only through a pronoun. And any place where it means to be precise that the direct object comes precisely – then it will indicate it through a pronoun that is attached to the word את.
And this will be through two ways: 1) If it means to say that the verb extends to all of the direct object itself and not to part of it. 2) If it intends to restrict it so that the verb does not extend to any other object, only to the direct object itself.
And both these ways are found when it is repeated <b>ונתח אותה לנתחיה</b> (and cut it into its pieces)<sup class="footnote-marker">329</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:6.</i> and <b>ונתח אותו לנתחיו</b> (And he shall cut it into its pieces)<sup class="footnote-marker">330</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:12.</i>, with respect to a burnt offering of a sheep and a cow. And they interpret that the first <i>אותה</i> teaches that it should cut it into its pieces, not its pieces into pieces. And the second <i>אותו</i> teaches that it should be <i>kosher</i> and not invalid.

Klal 151

Two verbs which come one after the other in a manner where the second verb completes and finishes the action of the first verb – if the direct object is mentioned after the first verb – the second verb will come alone without a pronoun and without the word את.<br>ולקח הכהן מדם החטאת <b>ונתן</b> (And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it)<sup class="footnote-marker">331</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:34.</i>. והרים את אזכרתה <b>והקטיר</b> (And the priest shall take off from the meal-offering the memorial-part thereof, and shall make it smoke)<sup class="footnote-marker">332</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 2:9.</i>.
And thus, any place where it deviates from this rule and a pronoun or the word אותו comes afterwards – the sages of blessed memory will interpet it to be for a certain restriction. And if the word אותו comes, the sages of blessed memory will usually interpret it for two restrictions. 1) From the extra pronoun. 2) From the fact that the pronoun is attached to the word את (as is mentioned in the preceding rule). And see interpretations like these with respect to<b>והשליך אותה</b> (and cast it beside the altar)<sup class="footnote-marker">333</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:16.</i>, <b>והקטיר אותו</b> (and the priest shall make it smoke)<sup class="footnote-marker">334</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:17.</i>, <b>והביאה</b> (And he shall bring it)<sup class="footnote-marker">335</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 2:2.</i>.
And moreover, when three verbs that come one after another where the last two complete the first – it is proper that the last two verbs come without a pronoun. Likeויעש גדי עיזים..ויוצא אליו..ויגש (And Gideon went in, <b>and made ready a kid</b>, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal; the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, <b>and brought it out to him</b> under the terebinth, <b>and presented it</b>)<sup class="footnote-marker">336</sup><i class="footnote">Judges 6:19.</i>. And when it is written והבאת את המנחה אשר יעשה מאלה ליהוה והקריבה אל הכהן והגישה אל המזבח (And you shall bring the meal-offering that is made of these things to the LORD; and it shall be presented to the priest, and he shall bring it to the altar)<sup class="footnote-marker">337</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 2:8.</i> with a pronoun, there is a homiletical interpretation.

Klal 152

And moreover, any place where the pronoun is superfluous – there will be a homiletical interpretation.
And there is a difference between <b>לנתחים</b> (to pieces) <b>למשפחות</b> (for families) and when it says it with a pronoun <b>לנתחיו</b> (to its pieces) <b>למשפחותיו</b> (for his families) - that whenever there is a pronoun, it means to say <i>all</i> of the pieces or families that are found.<br><br><i>Leviticus 1:6 says,והפשיט את העלה ונתח אתה לנתחיה (And he shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces). According to Rule 152, this means all of the pieces that are found in a bullock<sup class="footnote-marker">338</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 47.</i>.</i>

Klal 153

A <b>כינוי הנסתר</b> (hidden pronoun) sometimes comes with the letter נ with a diacritic dot - <b>יפקדֶנוּ יפקדֶנָה</b>. And sometimes, it comes without the letter נ, only the pronoun alone <b>יפקדוֹ יִפְקְדָה</b> or with the letter <a dir="rtl">ה</a> - <b>יפקדהוּ</b>.
And there is a rule in this: Any place where the absolute future comes – the pronoun comes with the letter נ. And in a place where the absolute future does not come, only the revealing of one’s will and desire, and moreover when a future tense verb comes with the prefix letter ו that reverses, and moreover in a place where the direct object pronoun is not intended to be precise – the letter ה or the letter ו will come alone.

Klal 154

The grammarians write that sometimes the verb will be repeated in order to beautify the poetic phrases. But this is not the opinion of the sages of blessed memory since according to them, for any repetition, even in statements that are poetic phrases, there are always reasons and interpretations. And all the more so with regard to legal standings, in which it is impossible that there will be any repeated or superfluous words. And the verb that is repeated will always have a reason for the repetition and there will be a homiletical interpretation. And the homiletical interpretations may also be able to be divided into several components, as we clarified in Chapter 15 with respect to nouns that are repeated.

Klal 155

Sometimes, the verb is repeated to teach us that it comes in a manner of precision and not with an agent - as when it repeats <b>יזה</b> (sprinkled)<sup class="footnote-marker">339</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:20.</i>, to teach that it means precisely blood that was proper for sprinkling, etc.

Klal 156

And sometimes a verb is repeated as an imperative to teach that the commandment can be done in any manner - and this will be if conditions are mentioned the first time the verb comes; in this case, the second time the verb comes will teach that even if the conditions that were mentioned are not satisfied, the commandment will nevertheless be considered to be fulfilled <i>ex post facto</i>.
When it is written ושרף אותו על עצים באש...על שפך הדשן ישרף (and burn it on wood with fire; where the ashes are poured out shall it be burnt)<sup class="footnote-marker">340</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:12.</i> – even though there are no ashes.
וטמאה שבעת ימים וכו' תטמא (then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of the impurity of her sickness shall she be unclean)<sup class="footnote-marker">341</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 12:2.</i> – even in the nights.
על כל שערו יגלח (all his hair he shall shave off)<sup class="footnote-marker">342</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:9.</i>.
Or if I could use logic to conclude that the verb only applies under a certain condition – the verb is repeated to say that it can be done in any manner, as when they interpret that וזרקו (dash)<sup class="footnote-marker">343</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1.</i> is repeated by a flock to teach <i>even in the absence of flesh</i>.
And moreover, any place where it says a verb with a condition and afterwards it is mentioned a second time without a condition – the condition is not necessary <i>ex post facto</i>.

Klal 157

And sometimes the verb is repeated, in order to teach that the second verb is different than the first:
As when it is written, כל האוכל...<b>יטמא</b> וכל משקה...<b>יטמא</b> (All food therein which may be eaten, that on which water comes, shall be unclean; and all drink in every such vessel that may be drunk shall be unclean)<sup class="footnote-marker">344</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 11:34.</i>, it means that each uncleanness is different.
And it repeats the verb <b>ונעלם</b> (hidden)<sup class="footnote-marker">345</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:2-3.</i> to differentiate between it being hidden from him that he was unclean and it being hidden from him that he entered the sanctuary.
And it repeats <b>וצוה הכהן</b> (And the priest shall command)<sup class="footnote-marker">346</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:4-5.</i> to teach that the second imperative will be precisely for the priest.

Klal 158

And sometimes the verb is repeated to divide an expression into two sentences.
As when it is written על הכליות יסירנה (which he shall take away hard by the kidneys)<sup class="footnote-marker">347</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 3:3-4.</i>, the verb יסירנה is added so that the expression is not continued with the verb והקריב, only that it is divided into two.
And it repeats the verb ילבש על בשרו (shall he put upon his flesh)<sup class="footnote-marker">348</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:3.</i> to divide the expression.
And it adds או מכל אשר ישבע (or any thing about which he has sworn falsely)<sup class="footnote-marker">349</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:24.</i> to divide between the principal, an added fifth, and a guilt offering.
And moreover, so it should be read as a topic in and of itself.
And all repeated sentences come precisely. And moreover, a warning that is repeated twice or three times – each time will teach about a distinct theme.

Klal 159

And sometimes the verb is repeated two times in two sentences, where one verb was enough, in order to compare the two sentences to each other. As when it is written אשר ישכב עליו הזב יטמא..ואשר ישב עליו יטמא (Every bed whereon he that has the issue lies shall be unclean; and every thing whereon he sits shall be unclean)<sup class="footnote-marker">350</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 15:4.</i> to compare the two words ישכב and ישב. And it was already explained that a noun may be repeated in order to compare. (See Rule 144.)
And moreover <b>המתואר כפול</b> (the noun being modified is repeated) in order to compare:
When it is writtenופשט את בגדיו ולבש בגדים אחרים (And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments)<sup class="footnote-marker">351</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:4.</i> – it compares garments that are put off with garments that are put on.
וחלצו אבנים..והביאו אבנים אחרות (they take out the stones… And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones)<sup class="footnote-marker">352</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:40-42.</i>.
And moreover, ושלושים יום ושלושת ימים (three and thirty days)<sup class="footnote-marker">353</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 12:4.</i>, מאת שנה ועשרים שנה(a hundred and seven and twenty years)<sup class="footnote-marker">354</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 23:1.</i> – the noun that is counted is repeated to compare.
גורל אחד..וגורל אחד (one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for Azazel)<sup class="footnote-marker">355</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:8.</i>.
And moreover, the subject is repeated: ולקח הכהן..ונתן הכהן(And the priest shall take…, and the priest shall put it upon…)<sup class="footnote-marker">356</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:14.</i> – just as he puts it upon by himself, he takes it by himself.
Also, a superfluous verb is written in order to compare with it another verb that is written there:
That שחיטה (kill)<sup class="footnote-marker">357</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:4-5.</i> is superfluous with a bullock in order to compare laying his hand upon the head of the bullock with killing the bullock.
The word תמים (without blemish)<sup class="footnote-marker">358</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:3.</i> is written with all of the sacrifices in order to teach that just as if it were to have a blemish it would be unacceptable, so too if it is not as indicated in the topic of sacrifices it is unacceptable.

Klal 160

And this is one of the foundations of comparison, היקש: Whenever two words are connected in the Scripture with one warning, it implies that there is a similarity between each other. And for those words which are not similar, the Scripture will never connect them together as one.
כל חלב וכל דם לא תאכלו (you shall eat neither fat nor blood)<sup class="footnote-marker">359</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 3:17.</i> – it compares blood to fat.
כסף או כלים (money or stuff)<sup class="footnote-marker">360</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 22:6.</i> – just as כלים is in plural…









כל שאור וכל דבש (for you shall make no leaven, nor any honey)<sup class="footnote-marker">361</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 2:11.</i> – it compares leaven to honey.

Klal 161

The Scripture will sometimes speak to the public and sometimes to the individual. And also within one topic, it will sometimes mix up plural with singular. And none of this is by accident. And all of the commandments and warnings which come in plural – they are precise in that it is to be interpreted as a warning to the public.
And commandments which come to the public in second person – it usually means the community:
Like לא תעלו עליו קטורת זרה (You shall offer no strange incense thereon)<sup class="footnote-marker">362</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 30:9.</i>.
המנחה אשר תקריבו (No meal-offering, which you shall bring to the LORD, shall be made with leaven)<sup class="footnote-marker">363</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 2:11.</i>.
קרבן ראשית תקריבו (As an offering of first-fruits you may bring them to the LORD)<sup class="footnote-marker">364</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 2:12.</i>.
זבחי שלמיכם (sacrifices of your peace-offerings)<sup class="footnote-marker">365</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:32.</i>.
All of these are interpreted to mean <i>the public</i>, because they come in plural.
And when it is written יהיה לכם לעושה בשגגה (you shall have one law for him that does aught in error)<sup class="footnote-marker">366</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 15:29.</i> in singular and plural, it means the individual and the public. And moreover, when it is written אבן שלמה יהיה לכם (Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall you have)<sup class="footnote-marker">367</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 19:36.</i> and in another place אבן שלמה יהיה לך (A perfect and just weight shall you have)<sup class="footnote-marker">368</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 25:15.</i>.
And moreover, with respect to commandments that speak to individuals and address everyone - they were a warning to the court.

Klal 162

All of the work of the sacrifices is written about in plural - <b>והקריבו וזרקו</b> (sacrifice and sprinkle) – since there were many priests.
But when it breaks this rule and says וערכו עצים (and lay wood)<sup class="footnote-marker">369</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:7.</i> and וערך הכהן (and the priest shall kindle wood on it every morning; and he shall lay the burnt-offering in order upon it)<sup class="footnote-marker">370</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:5.</i> – it is precise in that when it is offered at dusk (as is talked about in Leviticus 1:7), it requires two pieces of wood for two priests, and when offered at dawn (as is talked about in Leviticus 6:5), one priest is enough.
And moreover, when it is written with respect to the offering of the herd וערכו הנתחים (And Aaron's sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces)<sup class="footnote-marker">371</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:8.</i> and the offering of the flock וערך, <i>Sifra</i> gives a homiletical interpretation that six priests offer up the lamb.
And moreover, when it is written with respect to a peace offering of a herd or a flock והקטירו (burn incense), or with respect to a peace offering of a goat והקטירם, they interpret והקטירו to mean each one individually and והקטירם to mean <i>as one</i>.
And moreover, in the chapter about afflictions of houses, all verbs that come in singular mean that it is obligatory only for the owner. And when a verb comes in plural, it is also obligatory for the neighbors.
And it is always written ושחט (and kill), and in Leviticus 7:2 it says ישחטו את האשם (they kill the guilt-offering) – from here, it is implied that two kill.
And ישחטו את העולה (they kill the burnt-offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">372</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:2.</i> – from here, they derive that a communal burnt-offering is killed in the north.
And moreover, they give homiletical interpretations when it is written sometimes באבן (with a stone) and sometimes באבנים (with stones)<sup class="footnote-marker">373</sup><i class="footnote">Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 43a.</i>.

And moreover, any place where singular language comes on a plural noun or plural language comes on a singular noun, the sages are precise and apply homiletical interpretations.
As they give homiletical interpretations when it is written אל בני אהרון וקמץ (And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons)<sup class="footnote-marker">374</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 2:2.</i>.

And sometimes it will write a superfluous verb to reveal that the noun that is said at the beginning in plural does not mean <i>precisely</i>:
As when it says והקריבו (shall offer/bring it)<sup class="footnote-marker">379</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:15, 12:7.</i>, it is superfluous, in order to reveal that one dove or pigeon is enough.
And moreover, when it is written שרץ טמא (unclean swarming things)<sup class="footnote-marker">380</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:2.</i>, it is superfluous, to teach that the verb ונעלם (hidden) is referring to it, since it comes in masculine.<br><br><i>Leviticus 1:14-15 says,</i>ואם מן העוף עלה קרבנו ליהוה והקריב מן התרים או מן בני היונה את קרבנו. והקריבו הכהן אל המזבח ומלק את ראשו והקטיר המזבחה ונמצה דמו על קיר המזבח<i> (And if his offering to the LORD be a burnt-offering of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtle-doves, or of young pigeons. And the priest shall bring it to the altar, and pinch off its head, and make it smoke on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be drained out on the side of the altar).</i><br><br><i>And Leviticus 12:6-7 says,</i>ובמלאת ימי טהרה לבן או לבת תביא כבש בן שנתו לעלה ובן יונה או תר לחטאת אל פתח אהל מועד אל הכהן. והקריבו לפני יהוה וכפר עליה וטהרה ממקר דמיה זאת תורת הילדת לזכר או לנקבה<i> (And when the days of her purification are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtle-dove, for a sin-offering, to the door of the tent of meeting, to the priest. And he shall offer it before the LORD, and make atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood. This is the law for her that bears, whether a male or a female).</i><br><br><i>Both verses use the word </i>והקריבו<i> for “bring it/offer it”. The pronoun “it” is singular, which indicates that one dove or pigeon is enough.</i><br><br><i>Leviticus 5:2 says,</i>או נפש אשר תגע בכל דבר טמא או בנבלת חיה טמאה או בנבלת בהמה טמאה או בנבלת שרץ טמא ונעלם ממנו והוא טמא ואשם<i> (or if any one touch any unclean thing, whether it be the carcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean swarming things, and be guilty, it being hidden from him that he is unclean), using the superfluous noun phrase שרץ טמא (unclean swarming things). It is there to teach that the phrase </i>ונעלם ממנו<i> “it being hidden from him” is referring to it exclusively, since the verb ונעלם (hidden) comes in masculine and the noun phrase שרץ טמא comes in masculine, while the noun phrases “carcass of an unclean beast” and “carcass of unclean cattle” come in feminine<sup class="footnote-marker">381</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 303.</i>.</i>

And the custom of the language is that a noun indicating generality and the noun that comes next to it will come in singular, while the verb will come in plural.<b>כי מכרו מצרים איש שדהו</b> (For the Egyptians sold every man his field)<sup class="footnote-marker">382</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 47:20.</i>. <b>לקטו ממנו איש לפי אכלו</b> (Gather you of it every man according to his eating)<sup class="footnote-marker">383</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 16:16.</i>, etc. And this is the sign that the noun indicates generality. And whenever the noun indicating generality is <b>איש</b> (man), it will not exclude a woman. But nevertheless, whenever the Scripture uses this language, the matter must apply to everyone together and also apply to everyone individually.

Klal 166

A verb that comes with two subjects will sometimes come in singular and sometimes in plural. <b>ויצא</b> נח ובניו ואשתו (And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife)<sup class="footnote-marker">384</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 8:18.</i>. <b>ויבוא</b> משה ואהרן (And Moses and Aaron went)<sup class="footnote-marker">385</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 9:23.</i>. <b>ויקברו</b> אותו יצחק וישמעאל בניו (And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him)<sup class="footnote-marker">386</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 25:9.</i>. <b>ויקחו</b> שמעון ולוי איש חרבו (that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword)<sup class="footnote-marker">387</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 34:25.</i>.
And there is in this a rule that any place where two subjects are equal in rank and in the action – the verb will come in plural. And any place where one of the subjects is primary in rank or is first or is the primary in the action – the verb will come in singular.<br><br><i>Consider the Torah passages mentioned above:</i><br><br><i>Genesis 8:18 – </i>ויצא נח ובניו ואשתו ונשי בניו אתו<i> (And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him).</i><br><br><i>Leviticus 9:23 – </i>ויבא משה ואהרן אל אהל מועד ויצאו ויברכו את העם וירא כבוד יהוה אל כל העם<i> (And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out, and blessed the people; and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people).</i><br><br><i>Genesis 25:9 – </i>ויקברו אתו יצחק וישמעאל בניו אל מערת המכפלה אל שדה עפרן בן צחר החתי אשר על פני ממרא<i> (And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre).</i><br><br><i>Genesis 34:25 –</i>ויהי ביום השלישי בהיותם כאבים ויקחו שני בני יעקב שמעון ולוי אחי דינה איש חרבו ויבאו על העיר בטח ויהרגו כל זכר<i> (And it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city unaware, and slew all the males).</i><br><br><i>In the first two passages mentioned, the verbs are in singular, indicating that the subject that is first mentioned is primary. And in the last two passages mentioned, the verbs are in plural, indicating that the subjects are all equal in the context of the passages.</i>

Klal 167

And the opinion of the rabbis is that for this reason, sometimes the word <b>או</b> (or) comes to divide the subjects, even when the verb comes in singular, like ונפל שמה שור או חמור (and an ox or an ass fall therein)<sup class="footnote-marker">388</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 21:33.</i> and כי יצוד ציד חיה או עוף ושפך את דמו (that takes in hunting any beast or fowl that may be eaten, he shall pour out the blood thereof)<sup class="footnote-marker">389</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 17:13.</i>: Even with the verb ונפל and the pronoun of דמו in singular, one could err and think that it refers to the two subjects together and that one needsשור וחמור as one (and יצוד ציד חיה ועוף), in which the singular verb refers to the plural.
And Rabbi Yehuda disagrees with this and gives a logical argument that in these instances, the word או is not necessary to divide, since it is known to divide through the verb in singular voice, and the word או will come with a homiletical interpretation.

Klal 168

A plural noun that is associated with two subjects or two objects is understood sometimes as one for each one and sometimes as two for each one. As with ולבני אהרן תעשה כתנות (And for Aaron's sons you shall make tunics)<sup class="footnote-marker">390</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 28:40.</i>, one could interpret it as meaning make two tunics for each one or one could interpret תעשה כתנות as meaning one tunic for each one. And Rabbi Yossi and the sages disagree about this in the Jerusalem Talmud, while Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon disagree about this in the <i>Gemara</i>, in several places.

Klal 169

And when one judgement is mentioned about several matters – the predicate will come in plural. And if it comes in singular, it teaches that they may be combined with one another.
As when they give a homiletical interpretation for אך מעין ובור יהיה טהור (Nevertheless a fountain or a cistern wherein is a gathering of water shall be clean)<sup class="footnote-marker">391</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 11:36.</i>.
והיה בעור בשרו לנגע (and it become in the skin of his flesh the plague of leprosy)<sup class="footnote-marker">392</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:2.</i> – it teaches that all are combined together.<br><br><i>Leviticus 13:2 says,</i>אדם כי יהיה בעור בשרו שאת או ספחת או בהרת והיה בעור בשרו לנגע צרעת והובא אל אהרן הכהן או אל אחד מבניו הכהנים<i> (When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, or a scab, or a bright spot, and it become in the skin of his flesh the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons the priests), using the singular verb </i>והיה<i> for “and it become”.

And all of the prohibited actions which are said as negative commandments on their own are not combined, like fat and blood, left-overs and abominations, but if it mentions several prohibitions and it repeats them and includes all of them with one warning – they may be combined together. As when it repeats and includes unclean types when it is written טמאים הם לכם (Of their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch; they are unclean to you)<sup class="footnote-marker">394</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 11:8.</i>, this is to teach that they may be combined together.<br><br><i>Leviticus 11:8 says,</i>מבשרם לא תאכלו ובנבלתם לא תגעו טמאים הם לכם <i>(Of their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch; they are unclean to you) after prohibiting the eating of several unclean animals individually.

Klal 171

And sometimes the Scripture separates matters that are identical in their laws which would have been possible to include as one statement for two sections, in order to teach that each one is a topic on its own and that they cannot be combined together. As when it separates boils<sup class="footnote-marker">396</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:18-23.</i> and burning<sup class="footnote-marker">397</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:24-28.</i>, for this reason.<br><br><i>The laws pertaining to boils and burning are identical, even though the Torah writes about them in two different sections. This is to teach that each is a topic on its own and that they cannot be combined together, meaning that if a person has a boil half the size of a split bean and a burning half the size of a split bean, even though they add up to one split bean, the law still does not apply in such a case; the law only applies for a boil the size of at least one split bean or for a burning the size of at least one split bean<sup class="footnote-marker">398</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v”HaMitzvah Tazria 111.</i>.</i>

And moreover, the part of the Scripture where it elaborates וכל מנחה אשר תאפה בתנור וכל נעשה במרחשת וכולי (And every meal-offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is dressed in the stewing-pan, and on the griddle, shall be the priest's that offers it)<sup class="footnote-marker">399</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:9.</i> and it prolongs every detail (and does not say it in a brief and general way, like וכל המנחות לכל בני אהרן יהיו), it is this way in order to teach that a priest may not receive a share of meal-offerings in exchange for another share of meal-offerings. And through the superfluous words and their repetitions, we learn through the ways of the scholars that a priest may not receive a portion of an animal offering of one type in exchange for a portion of an animal offering of another type.

It is not the way of the Scripture to talk about a situation until a certain point and then switch to another situation. And when it stops talking about one who has issue lying in a bed and then starts talking about one who has issue sitting<sup class="footnote-marker">400</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 15:6.</i>, there is a homiletical interpretation.<br><br><i>Leviticus 15:6 says, </i>והישב על הכלי אשר ישב עליו הזב יכבס בגדיו ורחץ במים וטמא עד הערב<i>(And he that sits on any thing whereon he that has the issue sat shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening), changing the situation from </i>משכב<i> (lying in a bed) in the previous verses to</i>מושב <i>(sitting), and thus breaking Rule 173<sup class="footnote-marker">401</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Metzora 134.</i>.</i>

The sages of blessed memory are always precise about distinguishing between masculine and feminine in grammar.
When it is written פחתת היא (it is a fret)<sup class="footnote-marker">402</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:55.</i> in feminine, it is implied that it cannot refer to the plague.
And when it changes gender and says ולא ישאו עליו חטא (lest they bear sin for it)<sup class="footnote-marker">403</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 22:9.</i>, it should have written עליה (so it can refer to the noun משמרתי). This is so that one will not err and think that it refers to a carcass or food ritually unfit for eating, which comes in the previous sentence. And also it comes in feminine language for the purpose of a homiletical interpretation.
<i>Leviticus 13:55 says,</i>וראה הכהן אחרי הכבס את הנגע והנה לא הפך הנגע את עינו והנגע לא פשה טמא הוא באש תשרפנו פחתת הוא בקרחתו או בגבחתו<i> (And the priest shall look, after that the plague is washed; and, behold, if the plague have not changed its colour, and the plague be not spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it in the fire; it is a fret, whether the bareness be within or without), using the words </i>פחתת היא<i> for “it is a fret”. Since </i>פחתת היא<i> is in feminine, it cannot refer to </i>הנגע<i> (the plague), which is in masculine<sup class="footnote-marker">404</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Tazria 172.</i>.</i><br><br><i>Leviticus 22:9 says, </i>ושמרו את משמרתי ולא ישאו עליו חטא ומתו בו כי יחללהו אני יהוה מקדשם<i> (They shall therefore keep My charge, lest they bear sin for it, and die therein, if they profane it: I am the LORD who sanctify them), using the words ולא ישאו עליו חטא for “lest they bear sin for it”. The word משמרתי (My charge) in feminine alludes to the Sanctuary, which comes in masculine. Since the pronoun of עליו comes in masculine, it cannot refer to a carcass or food ritually unfit for eating, which is in the previous sentence, since they come in feminine. Therefore, it must be referring to the Sanctuary<sup class="footnote-marker">405</sup><i class="footnote">Ibn Ezra Commentary on Leviticus 22:9.</i>.</i>

Klal 175

In a place that begins with the noun <b>נפש</b> (soul) – the verb or two verbs (that come consecutively after it) must come in feminine. And verbs that come after <b>נפש</b> as a consequence or in the conclusion of a conditional statement will come in masculine, unless it is a verb that is typically used with the noun <b>נפש</b> (for instance, the verb <b>אכילה</b> (eating), <b>חטא</b> (sin), <b>טומאה</b> (uncleanness), <b>כרת</b> (cut off)); then they will also come afterwards in feminine.

Klal 176

And whenever one verb pertains to two subjects or direct objects, masculine and feminine – when one is the primary - the gender of the verb will be of the same gender as that of the primary noun, even if it is feminine. Like ותכתב אסתר המלכה ומרדכי (Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote down)<sup class="footnote-marker">406</sup><i class="footnote">Esther 9:29.</i> and ותשר דבורה וברק (Then sang Deborah and Barak)<sup class="footnote-marker">407</sup><i class="footnote">Judges 5:1.</i>. And it usually comes in masculine gender, because males are usually the primary.<br><br><i>In the two verses of the Scripture quoted, the verb is feminine, since the primary subject is female, in accordance with Rule 176.</i>

Klal 177

And there is a difference between a matter that depends on deeds and actions – then it usually comes in masculine singular, because usually the male is the primary part of the action – and an attribute that is found in a subject – then the male and female are equal and the verb will be in plural, like ואיש או אישה כי יהיו בעור בשרם בהרות (And if a man or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, even white bright spots)<sup class="footnote-marker">408</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:38.</i>.

Klal 178

And whenever the nouns<b>פר</b> (bull) <b>פרה</b> (cow), <b>עגל</b> (male calf) <b>עגלה</b> (female calf), etc., are mentioned, where the gender is indicated by whether there is a suffix ה - it is unnecessary to clarify that it will be male or female (only if it mentions the noun <b>בקר</b> (cattle) or <b>צאן</b> (sheep), where the gender is not indicated). And if it does clarify that it will be male or female, there will be a homiletical interpretation.

Klal 179

In conditional statements, the definite article ה will not come on the subject when it uses the word כי (or any word that means <i>if</i>) - <b>וכהן</b> כי יקנה נפש (But if a priest buy any soul)<sup class="footnote-marker">409</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 22:11.</i> אשר <b>נשיא</b> יחטא (When a ruler sins)<sup class="footnote-marker">410</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:22.</i>. (Unless it comes on the subject with the phrase word <b>אשר</b> - <b>האיש אשר</b> יעשה בזדון - And the man that does presumptuously<sup class="footnote-marker">411</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 17:12.</i>).
And the reason for this is that if the subject is also a proper noun, after it speaks about it in a possible way and in a possible time, it is nevertheless impossible to individualize it. For example, even though הנשיא is a proper noun, it is not possible to say אם <b>ה</b>נשיא יחטא, because in times of the future, there will be many leaders and we will not able to individualize which ones will sin. And when it writes אם <b>הכהן המשיח</b> יחטא (if the anointed priest shall sin)<sup class="footnote-marker">412</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:3.</i>, there is a homiletical interpretation.
However, whenever it talks afterwards about the subject in a way of decision – the definite article ה will come according to its rules.<br><br><i>Leviticus 4:3 says,</i>אם הכהן המשיח יחטא לאשמת העם והקריב על חטאתו אשר חטא פר בן בקר תמים ליהוה לחטאת<i> (if the anointed priest shall sin so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him offer for his sin, which he has sinned, a young bullock without blemish to the LORD for a sin-offering), using the words הכהן המשיח for “the anointed priest” with the definite articles </i>ה<i>, thus breaking Rule 179. The homiletical interpretation is that this indicates that he is the high priest<sup class="footnote-marker">413</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 202.</i>.</i>

Klal 180

And there is a difference between the adjective <b>משיח</b> (annointed) and the adjective <b>נשיא</b> (leader): The adjective נשיא is a title, and one is not called this when his leadership is over. This is not so with the adjective משיח, as one is called this even after it has expired.

Klal 181

It is from the rules of rhetoric that one should not find anything twisted and contorted in language, so also in the language of the <i>Mishnah</i>, it is strict in that it will not use contorted language - as it says in the <i>Babylonian Talmud Sotah 14b</i>, <i>מעלהו ומקטירו בכלי שרת. בכלי שרת מקטיר להו?! אימא מעלהו בכלי שרת להקטירו</i> (He brings it up and burns it in the service vessel. Does he really burn it in a service vessel? Rather say he brings it up to the altar in a service vessel in order to burn it). Thus, any place where the Medieval commentators interpret the Scripture to be contorted, the sages of blessed memory will interpret it in a way in which the words will make sense.
And this is if it is interpreted by way of the simple meaning, according to the order of the Scripture. As when it says אשר צוה לתת להם ביום משחו (which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that they were anointed)<sup class="footnote-marker">414</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:36.</i>. According to the Nachmanides, the writing is contorted, while the sages of blessed memory interpret it as a commandment that was not given to them until the day they were anointed.
Or they will explain by way of a homiletical interpretation a second meaning that is according to the order of the Scripture. As with a word that does not come in the right place, they explain the matter according to that which is written without the contorted language. For example, a word that belongs with the subject of an expression and it is proper for it to come near it but it is relocated and written after the object – they clarify it as if it is part of the object of the expression.
As when they interpret אדם כי יקריב מכם (When any man of you brings an offering to the LORD)<sup class="footnote-marker">415</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:2.</i>, it is proper to say אדם מכם כי יקריב, and it is interpreted to mean “A man who brings will be from you” – not an apostate. And there in <i>Torah Or</i>, I brought many like these.
And moreover, when it is written וזבחו זבחי שלמים לה' אותם (and sacrifice them for sacrifices of peace-offerings to the LORD)<sup class="footnote-marker">416</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 17:5.</i>, and the <i>Radak</i> noted in <i>Michlol </i>that it is contorted, while the sages of blessed memory give a homiletical interpretation.
Or they separated the statement into two. As when it is written אל פתח אוהל מועד יקריב אותו לפני השם (he shall bring it to the door of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before the LORD)<sup class="footnote-marker">417</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:3.</i>.
And also in other ways, they investigated and interpreted the Scripture according to its rules.

Klal 182

And moreover, whenever the order changes and a verse does not come in a way that is proper – the commentators will explain through their homiletical interpretations the reasons for its order.
And moreover, when it is said ורחץ את בשרו (and he shall bathe his flesh)<sup class="footnote-marker">418</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticcus 16:24.</i>, it does not come in the right place.

And moreover, in the sentence ובא אהרן אל אוהל מועד (And Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting)<sup class="footnote-marker">419</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:23.</i>, it is proven that it does not come in the right place, and there is a reason for this.

And moreover, if it considers several things and does not consider them according to their order and precedence:

And it changes the order for wearing clothes<sup class="footnote-marker">421</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 8 and Exodus 29.</i>.

And there is an order to all of the words that are found in a sentence. And there are in this rules and laws as to which word should come first. For example, when a noun precedes a verb and when a verb precedes a noun, we explained their rules in Chapter 12. And when a noun of secondary importance comes first and the reverse. And moreover, each and every word that comes in a sentence.
And after all of these rules, everything is founded on one rule, that the custom of the language is such that the word which is more important will always precede the word that is less important; whether it is a noun, a verb, or another part of speech, whether it is a subject, a predicate, or a preposition, etc. And when we wrote until here about this – as with the order of precedence of an adjective and a noun (Rules 59 and 60), nouns in construct state (Rule 61), and numbers (Rule 78, Rule 92, Rule 109, Rule 119, Rule 120, Rule 121) – all is founded upon this rule. And moreover, in it is many details, as we clarified.
And moreover, with respect to the order of the chapters in the Scripture, it is proper that the first in merit and study will come first. And a chapter from which the following chapter is learned – it is this way due to this law of precedence. And when the section about the anointed priest precedes the section about the congregation of Israel, there is a homiletical interpretation.<br><br><i>In Leviticus 4, the section about the anointed priest precedes the section about the congregation of Israel. This contradicts Rule 184, since the section about the anointed priest says לאשמת העם (so as to bring guilt on the people), indicating that the section about the congregation of Israel should come before the section about the anointed priest. The homiletical interpretation is that if the bullock of the high priest and the bullock of the congregation are both awaiting sacrifice, the bullock of the high priest takes precedence<sup class="footnote-marker">424</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 240.</i>.</i>

Whenever it mentions two nouns or topics – the noun that is primary in the expression will come first.

The main noun always precedes the noun which modifies it and is joined with it - <b>שרי אשת אברהם</b> (Sarai, wife of Abraham), <b>לוט בן אחיו</b> (Lot, son of his brother). And the noun which modifies the main noun never precedes the main noun, except in three places:

3) In a place where it means to be especially precise with the adjective: ועיני אחי בנימין (and the eyes of my brother Benjamin)<sup class="footnote-marker">432</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 45:12.</i> – he means to say <i>he is my true brother</i>.

In a place where the verb, the subject, and a preposition/pronoun that indicates the object are mentioned (like <b>אותי</b>, <b>עליו</b>, <b>לא</b>, <b>אליו</b>) – sometimes the subject comes first and sometimes the preposition/pronoun will come first.<a dir="rtl"><b>והקטיר אותו הכהן</b> - <b>והקטיר הכהן אותו</b>; <b>וכפר עליו הכהן</b> - <b>וכפר הכהן עליו</b>.</a>
And none of this is accidental. Only in a place where the preposition/pronoun comes first does it mean to be precise with the preposition/pronoun, like <b></b> <i>עליו</i>(upon him) - and not על חברו (upon his friend), etc. And moreover, when it is written אשר יפול מהם אל תוכו (whereinto any of them fall)<sup class="footnote-marker">433</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 11:33.</i> and והזה עליו מן הדם (And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger)<sup class="footnote-marker">434</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:19.</i>, the preposition/pronoun precedes the noun – so it comes to be precise.

Klal 188

The condition or the adjective that is found with the subject itself – the superfluous parts of the expression will come first. והאיש <b>אשר הוא טהור</b> וחדל לעשות הפסח (But the man that is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbear to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people; because he brought not the offering of the LORD in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin)<sup class="footnote-marker">435</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 9:13.</i>; האיש <b>אשר יטמא</b> ולא יתחטא (But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD; the water of sprinkling has not been dashed against him: he is unclean)<sup class="footnote-marker">436</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 19:20.</i>.
And when it is said ונפש כי תחטא ושמעה קול אלה <b>והוא עד</b> (And if any one sin, in that he hear the voice of adjuration, he being a witness, whether he has seen or known, if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity)<sup class="footnote-marker">437</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:1.</i>, it is an exception to the rule, as it should have written והוא עד ושמע קול אלה, and there is a homiletical interpretation.<br><br><i>When Leviticus 5:1 says, ונפש כי תחטא ושמעה קול אלה והוא עד או ראה או ידע אם לוא יגיד ונשא עונו (And if any one sin, in that he hears the voice of adjuration, he being a witness, whether he has seen or known, if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity), the clause והוא עד (he being a witness) does not come first in the expression in order to teach that it is necessary that he be singled out by the claimant to testify as a witness<sup class="footnote-marker">438</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 297.</i>.</i>

Klal 189

And sometimes the indirect object will come before the direct object. And sometimes it will come afterwards. <b>ותלד ליעקב בן</b> (and bore Jacob a son)<sup class="footnote-marker">439</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 30:5.</i> and <b>ותלד בן ליעקב</b> (and bore a son to Jacob).
And also this is dependent on the emphasis of the speech; the important and new information will always come first.

Klal 190

And in a place where the direct object is known from the verb and it only comes to clarify the verb – it will always come afterwards, since there is nothing new with it.וינגע ה' את פרעה נגעים (And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues)<sup class="footnote-marker">440</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 12:17.</i>;לא תשיך לאחיך נשך (You shall not lend upon interest to your brother)<sup class="footnote-marker">441</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 23:20.</i> – except in a place where the action is attributed to God - then the direct object will always come before the name of God. And the sages of blessed memory clarify that the reason for this is so that one should not mention the God’s Name for no reason.

Klal 191

After the wordאם (if) which indicates a division – the word that is the foundation of the division will always be right after it, whether it is a noun, a verb, or another part of speech.
For example:
Concerning the five types of sins, the noun comes firstאם הכהן המשיח יחטא...אם כל עדת ישראל ישגו...אשר נשיא יחטא...ואם נפש אחת תחטא (if the anointed priest shall sin…And if the whole congregation of Israel shall err…When a ruler sins… And if any one of the common people sin)<sup class="footnote-marker">442</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:3, 4:13, 4:22, 4:27.</i> - because the theme of the division is the differences between the sinners.
And when it is written ואם תחתיה תעמוד הבהרת (But if the bright spot stay in its place)<sup class="footnote-marker">443</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:23.</i>,אם לא מצאה ידו די השיב (But if he have not sufficient means to get it back for himself)<sup class="footnote-marker">444</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 25:28.</i> – the word that the division depends on comes first.
ואם פרוח תפרח הצרעת (And if the leprosy break out abroad)<sup class="footnote-marker">445</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:12.</i> ואם העלם יעלימו עם הארץ (And if the people of the land do at all hide)<sup class="footnote-marker">446</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 20:4.</i> – the verb comes first.

Klal 192

And if there is a category division and subordinate to it is a species division – then within the category division, the category will precede the species: אם עולה קרבנו מן הבקר (If his offering be a burnt-offering of the herd)<sup class="footnote-marker">447</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:3.</i>, ואם זבח שלמים קרבנו אם מן הבקר(And if his offering be a sacrifice of peace-offerings: if he offer of the herd)<sup class="footnote-marker">448</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 3:1.</i>.
And within a species division, the species will come first: ואם מן הצאן קרבנו לעולה (And if his offering be of the flock, whether of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">449</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:10.</i>.

Klal 193

And nevertheless, the custom of the language is that the name of a category comes at the end and the verb (or the noun that comes in place of the verb) precedes it - <b>קרבנו לעולה</b> (his offering for a burnt-offering), <b>קרבנו לזבח שלמים</b> (his offering for a sacrifice of peace-offerings). And when it is written ואם מן העוף עולה (And if his offering to the LORD be a burnt-offering of fowls)<sup class="footnote-marker">450</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:14.</i>, it deviates from this rule and there is a homiletical interpretation.<br><br><i>Leviticus 1:14 says, </i>ואם מן העוף עלה קרבנו ליהוה והקריב מן התרים או מן בני היונה את קרבנו<i> (And if his offering to the LORD be a burnt-offering of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtle-doves, or of young pigeons), using the language ואם מן העוף עלה קרבנו ליהוה for “And if his offering to the LORD be a burnt-offering of fowls”. This verse is not in accordance with Rule 193, as it should have said ואם מן העוף קרבנו לעולה. This is to teach that it is only talking about fowls that are offered as burnt offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">451</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 70.</i>.</i>

Klal 194

And moreover, a verb that is already mentioned in an expression and is repeated will come at the end. And if it comes early, there will be a homiletical interpretation.
As when it is written, זכר תמים <b>יקריבנו</b> אל פתח אוהל מועד <b>יקריב אותו</b> לרצונו לפני השם (he shall offer it a male without blemish; he shall bring it to the door of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before the LORD)<sup class="footnote-marker">452</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:3.</i>, it should have written לרצונו לפני ה' יקריב אותו. From this, the sages interpret new information with respect to the verb יקריב, and it means to say that he is forced to bring it.

Klal 195

Rule 195 is missing from the text of <i>Ayelet Hashachar</i>.

Klal 196

And moreover, in the conclusions of conditional statements, the most important word will come first. Therefore, if the verb that comes in a conclusion already comes in the hypothesis, it will come later. אדם כי <b>יקריב</b> קרבן..מן הבהמה <b>תקריבו</b>...אם עולה קרבנו זכר תמים <b>יקריבנו</b> (When any man of you brings an offering to the LORD, you shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd or of the flock. If his offering be a burnt-offering of the herd, he shall offer it a male without blemish)<sup class="footnote-marker">453</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:2-3.</i>.
And when it is said ואם מן העוף קרבנו..<b>והקריב</b> מן התורים (And if his offering to the LORD be a burnt-offering of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtle-doves, or of young pigeons)<sup class="footnote-marker">454</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:14.</i>, this is the opposite of the rules of the language, as it should have said מן התורים יקריב, and there is a homiletical interpretation.<br><br><i>Leviticus 1:14 says, </i>ואם מן העוף עלה קרבנו ליהוה והקריב מן התרים או מן בני היונה את קרבנו<i> (And if his offering to the LORD be a burnt-offering of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtle-doves, or of young pigeons), using the word והקריב for “he shall bring”. The reason why והקריב comes at the beginning of the conclusion of the conditional statement is to teach that two can bring it in partnership<sup class="footnote-marker">455</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 73.</i>.</i>

Klal 197

And it is the custom of the language that the subject should precede the remaining portions of the expression.
And when it is written, ואם האכל יאכל... המקריב אותו (And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings be at all eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted; neither shall it be imputed to him that offers it)<sup class="footnote-marker">456</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:18.</i> – it should have said, ואם המקריב אותו... יאכל, and there is a homiletical interpretation.
And moreover, when it is written וכלי חרס אשר יפול מהם אל תוכו כל אשר בתוכו יטמא ואותו תשברו (And every earthen vessel whereinto any of them falls, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean, and it you shall break)<sup class="footnote-marker">457</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 11:33.</i>, it should be the reverse – אותו תשבורו וכל אשר בתוכו יטמא; the law with respect to the vessel itself should come first and then afterwards the law with respect to whatever is in it. And from this, it is proven that אותו תשבורו means permission, and the fact that כל אשר בתוכו comes first implies that there is an obligation to break it if one wants it clean, which one is given permission to do.

Klal 198

And moreover, it is proper to indicate the place and afterwards indicate the condition of the place or a teaching with a certain perspective from the place.
Thus, when it is written <b>מחוץ לפרוכת העדות באהל מועד</b> (Without the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting)<sup class="footnote-marker">458</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 24:3.</i>, it is not proper. It should have written it as it said in Exodus 27:21<b>באהל מועד מחוץ לפרוכת</b> (In the tent of meeting, without the veil which is before the testimony). And the sages of blessed memory homiletically interpret when it is written באהל מועד (tent of meeting) that this expression extends to העדות (the testimony), and it means to say that God's Presence testifies in the tent of meeting.
And moreover, when it is written אל מקום טהור אל שפך הדשן (to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out)<sup class="footnote-marker">459</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:12.</i>, it comes out of order and it is proper in reverse, and there is a homiletical interpretation.

Klal 199

The custom of the Scripture is to always speak as <i>לא זו אף זו</i> (not only this, but also this), meaning that a matter which has in it something novel about its associate will say so in the end so that the latter adds new information to the former, but never the reverse.
And the sages of blessed memory give great homiletical interpretations from this principle.<br><br><i>See Rule 281 for an example.</i>

Klal 200

However, if two words are found in the Scripture where one is superfluous since it is implied from its associate <i>a fortiori</i> and it only comes to teach the meaning of its associate – then the noun that teaches will come at the end, even though the first noun is more of a novelty, and so it will speak as <i>זו ואין צורך לומר זו</i> (this and it is unnecessary to say this).
Like תושב ושכיר (a sojourner and a hired servant)<sup class="footnote-marker">460</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 12:45.</i>, in which the שכיר comes to teach about the תושב. And moreover, אל הקדש פנימה (into the sanctuary within)<sup class="footnote-marker">461</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 10:18.</i>, אל הקדש מבית לפרוכת (into the holy place within the veil)<sup class="footnote-marker">462</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:2.</i>.

Klal 201

Sometimes the order is reversed according to the causes and their effects:
As לא תגנבו (You shall not steal), and by that לא תכחשו (neither shall you deal falsely), and by that לא תשקרו (nor lie one to another)<sup class="footnote-marker">463</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 19:11.</i>.<br><br><i>Leviticus 19:11 says, </i>לא תגנבו ולא תכחשו ולא תשקרו איש בעמיתו<i> (You shall not steal; neither shall you deal falsely, nor lie one to another). The order is this way because if one steals, in the end he will deny it, and if he denies it, in the end he will lie<sup class="footnote-marker">464</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Kedoshim 26.</i>.</i>

Klal 202

It is the way of the Scripture to mention the law first and afterwards the reason:
As with all of the laws of sacrifices, it always says the reason at the end: <a dir="rtl"><b>עולה היא, מנחה היא, חטאת היא, ק"ק היא.</b></a>
And moreover with the laws of leprosy, it always mentions the law first and afterwards the reason: <b>וטהרו הכהן מספחת היא, וטמאו הכהן נגע צרעת היא</b> (then the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is a scab…then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy)<sup class="footnote-marker">465</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:6, 13:20.</i>.
And in a place where there is an exception to the rule and the reason precedes the law, the sages of blessed memory will give a homiletical interpretation. Usually they will explain that it is not a reason, only a condition.

Klal 203

And any place where it speaks about the subjects by way of general and particular – the particulars of the subjects will come at the end of the expression.
כי אם לפני ה' אלוקיך תאכלנו, במקום אשר יבחר ה' אתה ובניך וכולי (but you shall eat them before the LORD your God in the place which the LORD your God shall choose, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your man-servant, and your maid-servant, and the Levite that is within your gates…)<sup class="footnote-marker">466</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 12:18.</i>.
אתם ניצבים היום כולכם וכולי ראשיכם שבטיכם וכולי (You are standing this day all of you before the LORD your God: your heads, your tribes, and your officers, even all the men of Israel)<sup class="footnote-marker">467</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 29:9.</i>.
And in accordance with this, it clarifies when it is writtenיין ושכר אל תשת אתה ובניך אתך בבואכם אל אוהל מועד (Drink no wine nor strong drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the tent of meeting, that you die not; it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations)<sup class="footnote-marker">468</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 10:9.</i>, this is not in accordance with the rules of the language; it is proper that the particulars אתה ובינך אתך come at the end of the expression. And from this, the sages of blessed memory learn to split the statement into two; when it is written, אתה ובניך אתך, it is the end of the sentence, and when it is written בבואם אל אוהל מועד, it is another sentence.

Klal 204

And it is from the elegance of the language that any place where it mentions good and evil and it means <i>absolute</i> good and evil – the good will precede the evil. And when it is writtenלהרע או להיטיב (to do evil, or to do good)<sup class="footnote-marker">469</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:4.</i>, we learn that it is speaking about <i>relative</i> good and evil.
And it is the custom of the language when mentioning two conditions to mention first the condition which it is desired in His eyes, that it should be so.<br><br><i>As an example of relative evil, in HaTorah v’HaMitzvah the Malbim talks about fasting – relative to a person, it is not necessarily evil, but relative to a person’s body, it is evil<sup class="footnote-marker">470</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 312.</i>.</i>

Klal 205

The words which teach about time will always come at the end of an expression - לשרת לפני הארון <b>תמיד</b> (to minister before the ark continually)<sup class="footnote-marker">471</sup><i class="footnote">1 Chronicles 16:37.</i>, לא ידון רוחי באדם <b>לעולם</b> (My spirit shall not abide in man for ever)<sup class="footnote-marker">472</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 6:3.</i>.
And when it is written <b>אש תמיד</b> תוקד (fire shall be kept burning continually)<sup class="footnote-marker">473</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:6.</i>, it is proper that the word תמיד should come at the end, and there is a homiletical interpretation.<br><br><i>Leviticus 6:6 says, </i>אש תמיד תוקד על המזבח לא תכבה<i> (Fire shall be kept burning upon the altar continually; it shall not go out), with the word תמיד (continually) not coming at the end, which is against Rule 205. The reason for this is that the words </i>אש תמיד<i> have a double meaning - אש שהיא תמיד (fire that is always), so that the word </i>תמיד<i> modifies the word </i>אש<i> (fire)<sup class="footnote-marker">474</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Tzav 6.</i>.</i>

Klal 206

A noun that is in construct state with many:
Sometimes, the noun comes with everything in construct state: בפרי בטנך ובפרי אדמתך (in the fruit of your body, and in the fruit of your cattle, and in the fruit of your land)<sup class="footnote-marker">475</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 28:11.</i>, בכור שור בכור כשב בכור עז (the firstling of an ox, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat)<sup class="footnote-marker">476</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 18:17.</i>.
And sometimes it comes with everything at once like: מעשר דגנך תירושך ויצהרך (the tithe of your corn, of your wine, and of your oil)<sup class="footnote-marker">477</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 14:23.</i>.
And the sages of blessed memory had a rule for this in that any place where the themes are separate – the noun will come in construct state each time.

Klal 207

And moreover, the word <b>כל</b> (all) sometimes comes repeated with each noun and sometimes not. And it also depends on a rule, as it appears to me: Any place where the nouns are separate from one another – the word <b>כל</b> will be repeated with each and every one. And if some are subordinate to others – the word <b>כל</b> will only come on the first.

Klal 208

And moreover, it is the custom of the language that a preposition that corresponds to many nouns will come repeated with each noun. וישע ה' <b>אל</b> הבל <b>ואל</b> מנחתו (And the LORD had respect to Abel and to his offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">478</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 4:4.</i> <b>את</b> שם <b>ואת</b> חם <b>ואת</b> יפת (Shem, Ham, and Japheth)<sup class="footnote-marker">479</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 6:10.</i> בבקר <b>ו</b>בצאן <b>ו</b>ביין <b>ו</b>בשכר (for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink)<sup class="footnote-marker">480</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 14:26.</i>.
And nevertheless, we find many times where the preposition is dropped from one of the nouns. ויעשו בני ישראל ככל אשר ציוה ה' <b>את משה ואהרן</b> (And the children of Israel went and did so; as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron)<sup class="footnote-marker">481</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 12:28.</i>, בפר בן בקר לחטאת ואיל אחד לעולה (with a young bullock for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">482</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:3.</i>.
And the sages of blessed memory had a rule for this:
Any place where a preposition is repeated – it teaches that each is a topic in and of itself. And any place where a preposition is not found to correspond to one of them – it teaches that it is of secondary importance.
Or we are forced to conclude that the nouns do not all come with one preposition.
Or we are forced to conclude that there is only a preposition where a noun has another meaning.

Klal 209

Any place where a pronoun is added, even though the pronoun can be inferred from the conjugation of the verb – there will be a homiletical interpretation and an interpretation that the pronoun comes in its precise meaning.
Like <b>הוא מקריב , הם מקריבים , והוא לא ידע</b> – with all of these, it excludes anything else (other than <b>הוא</b> and <b>הם</b>).
And moreover when it says <b>ושמרתם אתם</b> (You therefore shall keep My statutes)<sup class="footnote-marker">483</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 18:26.</i>,<b>אתם תירשו</b> (you shall inherit their land)<sup class="footnote-marker">484</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 20:24.</i>, it comes to be precise with the word אתם.
And moreover when it says יין ושכר אל תשת אתה ובניך (Drink no wine nor strong drink, you, nor your sons with you)<sup class="footnote-marker">485</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 10:9.</i>, the word אתה is superfluous, and there is a homiletical interpretation.

Klal 210

And moreover, any place where it repeats the pronoun with the object - ולאחותו..לה יטמא (and for his sister a virgin, that is near to him, that has had no husband, for her may he defile himself)<sup class="footnote-marker">486</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 21:3.</i>, ובאחיכם..לא תרדה בו (but over your brethren the children of Israel you shall not rule, one over another, with rigour)<sup class="footnote-marker">487</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 25:46.</i>, באש תשרפנו את אשר בו הנגע (you shall burn that wherein the plague is with fire)<sup class="footnote-marker">488</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:57.</i> – there will always be a homiletical interpretation, and one can find them in this book.
And moreover, it may repeat the preposition <b>ממנו – מן</b>. Like והקריב <b>ממנו..מכל</b> קרבן(And of it he shall present one out of each offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">489</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:14.</i> and <b>ומאחיכם..מהם</b> תקנו.
And moreover, any place where the word <b>והוא</b> comes, it teaches the opposite and that it is a contradiction.
And if two different prepositions come, like ושחט אותה לחטאת (and kill it for a sin-offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">490</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:33.</i>, the prefix ל of the direct object pronoun is only for explaining it to mean <i>for the sake of a sin-offering</i>.
And in a place where a direct object is mentioned before a passive verb – usually it will not come back to it through a preposition prefix after the verb; and when does come back to it, it means that it is to be interpreted precisely - העיר אשר בחרת בה (toward the city which You have chosen)<sup class="footnote-marker">491</sup><i class="footnote">1 Kings 8:44.</i> and וכלי חרס אשר יגע בו הזב (And the earthen vessel, which he that has the issue touches)<sup class="footnote-marker">492</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 15:12.</i>.

Klal 211

And two nouns that come related to one another for which one comes after the other, sometimes both are drawn to the verb, like שודד מבית מבוא (for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in)<sup class="footnote-marker">493</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 23:1.</i>, וכל מעשר הארץ מזרע הארץ מפרי העץ(And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD'S)<sup class="footnote-marker">494</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 27:30.</i>. And thus, also in a place where one is drawn onto its associate, like ועשה מאחת מהנה (Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: If any one shall sin through error, in any of the things which the LORD has commanded not to be done, <b>and shall do any one of them</b>)<sup class="footnote-marker">495</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:2.</i>, the sages of blessed memory interpret it to mean<i>ועשה מאחת ועשה מהנה</i> - “and shall do any one…and shall do of them”.

Klal 212

And moreover, any place where the meaning of the language carries two interpretations, they will interpret it also according to the second interpretation, as the Torah is not written in a language like this for a vain purpose, and it is thus understood with respect to any theme that one is able to understand from it.
For example, there is a difference between the comparative that comes with the letter מ (אחיו הקטן יגדל <b>ממנו</b> - his younger brother shall be greater than he)<sup class="footnote-marker">496</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 48:19.</i>, and the superlative that comes with with the letter ה (היפה <b>בנשים</b> - fairest among women<sup class="footnote-marker">497</sup><i class="footnote">Songs of Songs 1:8.</i>) (unless the letter מ comes on the word כל - גבוה מכל העם - he was higher than any of the people)<sup class="footnote-marker">498</sup><i class="footnote">1 Samuel 9:2.</i>. Thus, when it is written הגדול מאחיו (highest among his brethren)<sup class="footnote-marker">499</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 21:10.</i>, it should have said הגדול באחיו. The letter מ gives it a second meaning - <i>גדלהו משל אחיו</i> (if he does not have personal wealth, he should be made great from the property of his brethren)<sup class="footnote-marker">500</sup><i class="footnote">Babylonian Talmud Horayot 9a.</i>.
And all the more so, any place where there exists a distortion or a shifting from the rules of the language, a second homiletical interpretation will also be given, as is written about above several times.

Klal 213

When dividing something into categories, it is necessary that the division be complete and all-inclusive. For example, if it is desired to distinguish between types of men according to their skin color, it will be said, <i>מין האדם לפי צבעו. יש לבנים ביותר, לבנים אדמדמים, אדום בוהק, שחורים כגחל, שקערורים אדמדמים, שקערורים ירקרוקים, וכדומה</i> (Type of man according to his skin color - there are extremely white, reddish white, shiny red, coal black, reddish dim, greenish dim, etc.) Indeed, one could do this using only extreme skin types; for example, <i>יש אנשים שחורים ואנשים לבנים</i> (there are black people and white people), and the remainder of types will fall into one of these two main categories.
And moreover, it is customary for the Torah to talk in terms of division into categories. For example, it divides (for the topic of absorption with respect to a sin offering) between an earthenware vessel and a brazen vessel, and the remainder of vessels fall into one of these two categories<sup class="footnote-marker">501</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Tzav 67.</i>. And when dividing between sacred foods that are eaten for one day and those that are eaten for two days, it uses תודה ושלמים (thanksgiving for one day and peace offerings for two days)<sup class="footnote-marker">502</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Tzav 112.</i>. And the remainder of types fall into one of these two categories. And moreover, a daily offering. And a recognized sign that the intention of the Torah is to make an all-inclusive division is when it uses the name of a category with the name of a type – for instance, כלי חרס, כלי נחושת, כלי עץ, זבח תודה, זבח שלמים (an earthenware vessel, a brazen vessel, a wooden vessel, a thanksgiving offering, a peace offering).

Klal 214

And moreover, the word <b>או</b> (or) indicates a division between types. And when it says או בגד או עור (or raiment, or skin)<sup class="footnote-marker">503</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 11:32.</i> and moreover או עור או פסח (a blind man, or a lame)<sup class="footnote-marker">504</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 21:18.</i> etc., it comes to make an all-inclusive division, and anything similar to raiment or skin is included with בגד ועור.

Klal 215

And the Scripture only speaks with separate conditional statements when they are mutually exclusive, but in a place where it is depicted that everything is done as one and the Scripture means to inform of each and every judgement – it will not separate them by way of division through the word אם; it will only inform of their judgements in the form of an absolute statement, not by way of a conditional statement.
For example, מכל הבהמה הטהורה תקח לך שבעה שבעה ומן הבהמה אשר לא טהורה וכולי (Of every clean beast you shall take to you seven and seven, each with his mate; and of the beasts that are not clean two [and two], each with his mate)<sup class="footnote-marker">505</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 7:2.</i>.

Klal 216

And it is proper that the divisions will be mutually exclusive.
Thus, when it is written ועשה לפר כאשר עשה לפר החטאת (Thus shall he do with the bullock; as he did with the bullock of the sin-offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">506</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:20.</i> it is not accurate, as both bullocks are of the sin-offerings, and there is a homiletical explanation.
And moreover, when it says ואם נפש אחת תחטא (And if any one of the common people sin)<sup class="footnote-marker">507</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:27.</i>.
And moreover, when it says וזה לכם הטמא בשרץ השורץ על הארץ(And these are they which are unclean to you among the swarming things that swarm upon the earth)<sup class="footnote-marker">508</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 11:29.</i> – it implies that there are swarming things in the water.

Klal 217

And sometimes a division of an expression will have two איברים (limbs) (it means to say that each division includes two things), and then such a division will also only have one noun; thus, the two things will be included with this one noun.<br><br><i>Leviticus 7:9-10 says,</i>וכל מנחה אשר תאפה בתנור וכל נעשה במרחשת ועל מחבת לכהן המקריב אתה לו תהיה וכל מנחה בלולה בשמן וחרבה לכל בני אהרן תהיה איש כאחיו<i> (And every meal-offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is dressed in the stewing-pan, and on the griddle, shall be the priest's that offers it. And every meal-offering, mingled with oil, or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as well as another).</i><br><br><i>Here are the two divisions, each with two </i>איברים<i>:</i><br><br><i>A) </I>וכל נעשה במרחשת ועל מחבת<i> (and all that is dressed in the stewing-pan, and on the griddle).</i><br><br><i>B) </I>וכל מנחה בלולה בשמן וחרבה<i> (And every meal-offering, mingled with oil, or dry)<sup class="footnote-marker">509</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Tzav 90.</i>.</i>

Klal 218

If a category is mentioned and afterwards it distinguishes between its types – we can be certain that the rest of the things that are not mentioned in the Scripture are the same for all of these types.

Klal 219

And for an expression that comes with several types and in each type there are details that are found in only one type and details that are found in more than one type, and one detail is found explicitly in one type but is ambiguous in the remainder of types (it does not clarify that it is the opposite in the remainder of types) – we learn that whenever one detail is mentioned explicitly in many types, it is thus the rule that these types share in the other detail that is only mentioned explicitly in one of them.<br><br><i>Leviticus 7:12 says,</i> אם על תודה יקריבנו והקריב על זבח התודה חלות מצות בלולת בשמן ורקיקי מצות משחים בשמן וסלת מרבכת חלת בלולת בשמן<i> (If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour soaked).</i><br><br><i>There are three types:</i><br>1) חלות מצות בלולת בשמן<i> (unleavened cakes mingled with oil).</i><br>2) ורקיקי מצות משחים בשמן<i> (and unleavened wafers spread with oil).</i><br>3) וסלת מרבכת חלת בלולת בשמן<i> (and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour soaked).</i><br><br><i>It uses the word</i> חלות <i>for “cakes” in the first and third types; however, the first and third types are different in that the third type is</i> מורבכת <i>(soaked) but not the first type, and the third type has </i>סולת<i> (fine flour) but is ambiguous in the first type. Hence, </i>סולת<i> must also apply in the first type, according to Rule 219<sup class="footnote-marker">510</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Tzav 103.</i>.</i>

Klal 220

In any place where there is a division that is not dependent on the actions of a person, but only on a matter that is a reality – it will use the word that indicates that it is a reality, <b>הוא</b> - אם בן הוא ואם בת היא (if it be a son, then you shall kill him; but if it be a daughter, then she shall live)<sup class="footnote-marker">511</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 1:16.</i>.
And when it is written ואם נקבה תלד (But if she bear a maid-child)<sup class="footnote-marker">512</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 12:5.</i>, it comes to teach that one does not need to know the nature of the thing clearly; it can even have an indeterminate gender or be a hermaphrodite.

Klal 221

And the word which indicates division is the word <b>אם</b> (if). But when it is written נגע צרעת כי תהיה באדם (When the plague of leprosy is in a man)<sup class="footnote-marker">513</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:9.</i> and does not say <b>ואם שאת</b> (and if there is a rising) – it is clarified that it is not a division from the previous statement, and it is only an expression in and of itself.<br><br><i>Leviticus 13:8-9 says,</i>וראה הכהן והנה פשתה המספחת בעור וטמאו הכהן צרעת הוא. נגע צרעת כי תהיה באדם והובא אל הכהן<i> (And the priest shall look, and, behold, if the scab be spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is leprosy. When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought to the priest), using the word </i>כי<i> for “when” instead of </i>אם<i>. This is to indicate that verse Leviticus 13:9 has nothing to do with the previous verse, Leviticus 13:8, i.e., it is an expression in and of itself, a new topic.</i>

Klal 222

And any division that is established between subjects or objects, but not between verbs – it will speak by way of a verb, not by way of a noun, like ואם משדה אחוזתו יקדיש (And if a man shall sanctify to the LORD part of the field of his possession)<sup class="footnote-marker">514</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 27:16.</i>, ואם בית אישה נדרה (And if a woman vowed in her husband's house)<sup class="footnote-marker">515</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 30:11.</i>.
And therefore, when it is written ואם מן הצאן קרבנו (And if his offering be of the flock)<sup class="footnote-marker">516</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:10.</i> and ואם זבח שלמים קרבנו (And if his offering be a sacrifice of peace-offerings)<sup class="footnote-marker">517</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 3:1.</i>, it is proper to sayואם מן הצאן מקריב. And this is the reason why the word קרבנו is given a homiletical interpretation.<br><br><i>Leviticus 1:10 says, </i>ואם מן הצאן קרבנו מן הכשבים או מן העזים לעלה זכר תמים יקריבנו<i> (And if his offering be of the flock, whether of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-offering, he shall offer it a male without blemish), using the word קרבנו for “his offering” instead of the verb מקריב (offer), contradicting Rule 222. The homiletical interpretation is that the word קרבנו is there to exclude offerings that were stolen<sup class="footnote-marker">518</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 61.</i>.</i>

Klal 223

In a place where two nouns are mentioned and for each noun there is a special imperative, we sometimes find them <i>giving of each other</i>:
Like לא תעבוד בבכור שורך ולא תגוז בכור צאנך (you shall do no work with the firstling of your ox, nor shear the firstling of your flock)<sup class="footnote-marker">519</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 15:19.</i>, that the same applies in which one is prohibited from fleecing the ox and forcing one’s sheep to work, and it uses the fact that it is normal for an ox to work and for one to fleece a sheep.
And moreover, when it says לגר אשר בשעריך תתננו או מכור לנכרי (you may give it to the stranger that is within your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it to a foreigner)<sup class="footnote-marker">520</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 14:21.</i>, it is logical to Rabbi Meir that it uses the fact that the normal way is to give to a stranger and to sell to a foreigner; and thus, it is also the reverse.
And moreover, if it uses with each one a novelty, as it does with interest and increase<sup class="footnote-marker">521</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 25:36.</i>.
Indeed, in a place where it does not speak in the normal way, as when it says בכל קדש לא תגע ואל המקדש לא תבוא (she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary)<sup class="footnote-marker">522</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 12:4.</i>, they say that in the Temple, touching is permitted, that if it were not so, it would have written בכל קדש ובמקדש לא תגע (she shall touch no hallowed thing or the sanctuary) and moreover, we find it in this language many times, in which it comes precisely.
And Rabbi Yehuda gives a rule for this – any place where it repeats one condition in two sentences – it means that with the repeated conditions, each one by itself is precise and they do not <i>give of each other</i>.

Klal 224

If it warns about two things where one is implied through an <i>argumentum a fortiori</i> from the other, we are forced to conclude that it warns about the one with a more severe warning. Like יין ושכר אל תשת (Drink no wine nor strong drink)<sup class="footnote-marker">523</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 10:9.</i> and אל הקודש מבית לפרוכת (into the holy place within the veil)<sup class="footnote-marker">524</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:2.</i>, etc.

Klal 225

In all of the chapter about afflictions, whenever two conditions come, one will come as a condition and one will come as a novelty.<br><br><i>Leviticus 13:4 says,</i>ואם בהרת לבנה הוא בעור בשרו ועמק אין מראה מן העור ושערה לא הפך לבן והסגיר הכהן את הנגע שבעת ימים<i> (And if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white, then the priest shall shut up him that has the plague seven days). The first condition is “And if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh”. And the second condition is “and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white”. In this case, the second condition comes as a novelty and means <b>even if the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white</b>, he should be quarantined, in accordance with Rule 225<sup class="footnote-marker">525</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Tazria 64.</i>.</i>

Klal 226

Two sentences that are linked by cause and effect through the word <b>כי</b>, where one sentence is the reason for its associate – they must be talking about the same matter, and it will only warn in the sentence that is effect when it warns in the sentence that is the cause.<br><br><i>Leviticus 7:23-25 says,</i> דבר אל בני ישראל לאמר כל חלב שור וכשב ועז לא תאכלו. וחלב נבלה וחלב טרפה יעשה לכל מלאכה ואכל לא תאכלהו. כי כל אכל חלב מן הבהמה אשר יקריב ממנה אשה ליהוה ונכרתה הנפש האכלת מעמיה<i> (Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: You shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat. And the fat of that which dies of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of beasts, may be used for any other service; but you shall in no wise eat of it. For whosoever eats the fat of the beast, of which men present an offering made by fire to the LORD, even the soul that eats it shall be cut off from his people), linking the sentences by cause and effect via the word כי. Thus, by Rule 226 Leviticus 7:23-24 and Leviticus 7:25 must be talking about the same matter, the prohibition of eating fat<sup class="footnote-marker">526</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Tzav 141.</i>.</i>

Klal 227

The word <b>לא</b> (not) sometimes means a negation and sometimes means a warning. That is, whenever it is in a place where one might think it is a commandment, it could mean that it is a negation, as לא יבדיל (but shall not divide it asunder)<sup class="footnote-marker">527</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:8.</i> means <i>it is not necessary</i> to divide, that one might think it is a commandment to divide the sin offering of the bird apart. As when Maimonides writes in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> Chapter 8.
And moreover, an imperative sometimes means permission. And Rabbi Ishmael and Rabbi Akiva disagree about this<sup class="footnote-marker">528</sup><i class="footnote">Babylonian Talmud Sotah 3a.</i> when it says לה יטמא (for her may he defile himself)<sup class="footnote-marker">529</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 21:3.</i>, לעולם בהם תעבודו (of them may you take your bondmen for ever)<sup class="footnote-marker">530</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 25:46.</i>, וקנא את אשתו (and he be jealous of his wife)<sup class="footnote-marker">531</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 5:14.</i>.
And thus, two statements that come one after another where the first is a warning and the second is an imperative that contradicts the warning – it is not a commandment, only permission. Like שלש שנים יהיה לכם ערלים..ובשנה החמישית תאכלו את פריו (three years shall it be as forbidden to you…But in the fifth year may you eat of the fruit thereof)<sup class="footnote-marker">532</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 19:23-25.</i>.

Klal 228

And moreover, any place where one might think it is prohibited to do a certain action and the action comes as an imperative – one should interpret it to mean that it is optional. Hence, in this way any place where it wants to teach that it is a commandment, the imperative will be repeated. Or the infinitive will be repeated before the verb to teach that it is an obligation, like אכול תאכלו אותה בקדש (you should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded)<sup class="footnote-marker">533</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 10:18.</i>.

Klal 229

And any place where it comes to impose a condition on the previous negation, it will indicate the condition with the words <b>כי אם</b> (לא אשלחך כי אם ברכתני – I will not let you go, except you bless me<sup class="footnote-marker">534</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 32:27.</i>). And with this, it is not the custom to mention the verb again. And when it does repeat the verb, it comes to teach one not to err in thinking that it means that it is optional (reversing the warning that precedes it), but that it is an obligation. Or it is repeated for a special imperative.<br><br><i>Leviticus 21:1-3 says,ויאמר יהוה אל משה אמר אל הכהנים בני אהרן ואמרת אלהם לנפש לא יטמא בעמיו. כי אם לשארו הקרב אליו לאמו ולאביו ולבנו ולבתו ולאחיו. ולאחתו הבתולה הקרובה אליו אשר לא היתה לאיש לה יטמא (And the LORD said unto Moses: Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron, and say unto them: There shall none defile himself for the dead among his people; except for his kin, that is near unto him, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother; and for his sister a virgin, that is near unto him, that has had no husband, for her may he defile himself), repeating the word יטמא for “defile”. According to Rule 229, this is to teach that it is an obligation for a priest to defile himself for his close kin<sup class="footnote-marker">535</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Emor 8.</i>.</i>

Klal 230

And there is a difference between the word <b>כי</b> (when it is used as “rather”) and the words <b>כי אם</b> (only if):
Any place where it comes to impose a condition on the previous negation – that it will not be in any manner except in this manner – the words כי אם will come. [The word אם is used with the condition, and it usually means <i>לא יהיה הדבר רק אם יהיה בו תנאי זה</i> <i>(the matter will only be if this condition will be)</i>, like יאכל מן הקדשים כי אם רחץ בשרו במים (יאכל) לא (and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water)<sup class="footnote-marker">536</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 22:6.</i>. And also in a place where the condition is not mentioned explicitly: לא ירשך זה כי אם אשר יצא ממעיך (This man shall not be your heir; but he that shall come forth out of your own bowels shall be your heir)<sup class="footnote-marker">537</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 15:4.</i> – it means to say that inheritance should not be elucidated in any manner other than to his own children.]
But the word כי is never connected with the previous.

Klal 231

Any place where it makes an analogy between one matter and another matter, the Torah will not mention explicitly that the law applies for both matters. And when the Torah does mention that the law applies for both matters explicitly, the analogy is superfluous, and there will be a homiletical interpretation.
And it is not the way of the Scripture to deduce the law for the previous from the law for the subsequent, only the law for the subsequent from the law for the previous.

Klal 232

And there are many ways in which the sages interpret the Scripture. And most are through superfluous language or modified language, etc. And most can be found in the rules that we have written.
Also, they use Rabbi Ishmael’s 13 rules of Biblical Exegesis<sup class="footnote-marker">538</sup><i class="footnote">https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/hermeneutics</i>:
And the matters of<i>גזירה שוה </i>(verbal analogy) and <i>בנין אב</i> (inductive inference) are not as compelling as the rules that are mentioned here, since they are founded in the language of the Scripture itself; thus, Maimonides calls them דברי סופרים (words of the scribes). Nevertheless, we have always tried to also bring <i>גזירה שוה</i> and <i>בנין אב</i> closer to common sense.
And moreover, the matter of <i>כלל ופרט</i> (general and particular) is never distant from the plain meaning.
And aבכלל המוסף על הפרט (general adds to the particular).
And ושני כללות הסמוכים זה לזה (two generalizations that are adjacent to one another).
And if the particulars are known from the general alone, it will be superfluous and will come for a homiletical interpretation. As when it says מן הצאן מן הכבשים ומן העזים (And if his offering be of the flock, whether of the sheep, or of the goats)<sup class="footnote-marker">539</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:10.</i>.
And moreover, after it mentions the particulars – a general rule will be superfluous, and there will be a homiletical interpretation.
And for a specific that is after a general, it is not the custom for it to come with a connecting ו.
And moreover, whenever something is learned from its context, it is logical that an ambiguous text is to be understood from an unambiguous text that is adjacent to it. As when it teaches not to steal in the <i>Ten Commandments</i>, it means kidnapping, since “do not murder” is adjacent to it and since in Leviticus 19-20, it talks about stealing money, etc.

Klal 233

And moreover, whenever two passages of the Scripture contradict one another:
If there is a deciding verse, we interpret according to it.
And if not, then the sages of blessed memory will place an interpretation on a theme in which both may occur together.
And sometimes, there are disagreements about which passage is more important.

Klal 234

And there are many great rules in the ways of moral conduct, but there are no places here. For here, I only come to clarify the rules established in the ways of the language and logic, that the ideas which the sages of blessed memory infer through these rules are similar to the words that are written down explicitly and they are actual words of Torah, for they are compelled to be within the literal meaning of the Scripture. And also, any place where the sages of blessed memory infer ideas that are not mentioned in Scripture at all, like the three quarantines of a house that is afflicted, and all of the laws that come from tradition – we can see, praises to God, their foundations in the language of the Scripture itself.

Klal 235

And also any place that is known to deviate from the plain meaning and they say their words by way of an אסמכתא (support), we clarified that we do not deviate right or left from the simple plain meaning. As when the sages teach that there is no אונאה (fraud) with respect to land, Nachmanides writes that this is the opposite of the Scripture. And moreover, with the prohibition of work activity during the weekdays of a festival, etc.<br><br><i>An </i>אסמכתא<i> “denotes the use of a biblical text merely as a ‘support’ for a halakhah without suggesting that the halakhah is thus actually derived from this exegesis”</i><sup class="footnote-marker">540</sup><i class="footnote">https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/asmakhta</i>.

Klal 236

Indeed, when it says several times (in the Talmud) <i>מדרבנן וקרא אסמכתא בעלמא</i> (it is by rabbinic law and the verse is cited as a mere support), it is an interpretation, not a proof from the language nor from a basic rule, and the sages rely upon it in a distant way. And it was clarified by us that it was this way because sages of blessed memory did not have the power to decree or to establish a matter that is the opposite of what comes explicitly in the Torah. And when the adjucators of Jewish Law wanted to issue their decrees, they were forced to prove that there is nothing explicitly in the Torah that is the opposite of their decrees and that the Written Law tolerates another interpretation that is in agreement with their decrees.<br><br><i>See Rule 235 for a definition of אסמכתא.</i>

Klal 237

And when the sages say that an amplificatory expression after an amplificatory expression comes to restrict and a restrictive expression after a restrictive expression comes to amplify, this is founded upon the wisdom of logic, and there are in this several rules. However, all of the places where I found this rule in <i>Sifra</i> are based upon one foundation - it is known in logic that whenever two nouns come one after the other, the second noun restricts the first, and if the scope of the second noun includes more than the first, it comes to amplify; and whenever the order is reversed, it comes to restrict (as when we wrote in Rule 266 about the difference between בני אהרן הכהנים (Aaron’s sons, the priests) and הכהנים בני אהרן (the priests, Aaron’s sons)).
And if a third noun comes after it – it comes to restrict the second noun. And if the second noun restricts – the third noun comes to restrict it, that it will not restrict anything. And if it comes to amplify – the third noun comes to restrict it, that it will not amplify anything.

Klal 238

The law of God is perfect<sup class="footnote-marker">541</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 19:8.</i>. Just as there is nothing missing, so too it is impossible that anything in it is superfluous. And any place where it is seen that the language is long and there are superflous words, the sages of blessed memory in their wisdom fixed this perception and clarified why it needed to be so long. And it was either to teach that the law is also applicable in other places, to safeguard from mistakes, to teach a second meaning, or to continue the expression and explain it according to the tradition.
And there are in this many different ways. And we already explained above several rules pertaining to this in various sections:
As with a gerund that is added onto the predicate. And an infinitive that is added. (Chapter 4)
A number that is superfluous. (Chapter 8) (Chapter 9 - Rule 77, Rule 80)
And a category name that is added. (Rule 95)
And an adjective that is added. (Chapter 14)
And a noun that is repeated. (Chapter 15)
And a verb that is changed in its conjugation. (Chapter 17)
And besides these, any place where there is superfluous language, there will be a homiletical interpretation. And these are the foundations of the tradition.











And all the more so, if contradictory words are added, as when it is written מדוע לא אכלתם את החטאת במקום הקדש (Wherefore have you not eaten the sin-offering in the place of the sanctuary)<sup class="footnote-marker">542</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 10:17.</i> – and they really do not eat at all anywhere.
And moreover, any repeated language like ישוב...ונהפך(the raw flesh again be turned into white)<sup class="footnote-marker">543</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:16.</i>, etc.

Klal 239

And several times, it adds a special expression to teach that it is an all-inclusive topic in every place.
As when it adds כל חלב להשם (all the fat is the LORD'S)<sup class="footnote-marker">544</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 3:16.</i>.
והקריב את אשר לחטאת ראשונה (who shall offer that which is for the sin-offering first)<sup class="footnote-marker">545</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:8.</i>.
And moreover in the chapter about afflictions, it lengthens, repeats, and adds completely superfluous expressions in order to teach that the laws apply with respect to all types of plagues and quarantines.<br><br><i>Leviticus 3:16 says, </i>והקטירם הכהן המזבחה לחם אשה לריח ניחח כל חלב ליהוה<i> (And the priest shall make them smoke upon the altar; it is the food of the offering made by fire, for a sweet savour; all the fat is the LORD'S), using the language כל חלב להשם for “all the fat is the LORD’s”. This is to include the fat in the prohibition of illegal use of holy property<sup class="footnote-marker">546</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 188.</i>.</i><br><br><i>Leviticus 5:8 says, </i>והביא אתם אל הכהן והקריב את אשר לחטאת ראשונה ומלק את ראשו ממול ערפו ולא יבדיל<i> (And he shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin-offering first, and pinch off its head close by its neck, but shall not divide it asunder), using the language </i>והקריב את אשר לחטאת ראשונה<i> for “who shall offer that which is for the sin-offering first”. This is to teach that this law applies to all sin offerings that are accompanied by burnt offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">547</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 331.</i>.</i>

Klal 240

And any place where it says <b>יכבס בגדיו</b> (shall wash his clothes) and it adds <b>וטמא עד הערב</b> (and be unclean until the even), there will be a homiletical interpretation.
And moreover, when it says וטמא עד הערב <b>וטהר</b> (and be unclean until the even; then shall he be clean)<sup class="footnote-marker">548</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 17:15.</i>, the word <b>וטהר</b> is superfluous for a homiletical interpretation.
And in every place, it will say <b>ימול</b> (circumcise) alone, except when it says <b>ימול בשר ערלתו</b> (the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised)<sup class="footnote-marker">549</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 12:3.</i> for a homiletical interpretation.
And in every place, it will say <b>ורחץ במים</b> (bathe in water), but in eight places it says<b>ורחץ במים את בשרו</b> (bathe his flesh in water), and all of this is for homiletical interpretations.
And it is not mentioned anywhere ואחרי כן יבוא אל המחנה (and afterward he may come into the camp); except with sending the <i>Azazel </i>(scapegoat)<sup class="footnote-marker">550</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:26.</i> and with a heifer<sup class="footnote-marker">551</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 19:7.</i> and with bullocks<sup class="footnote-marker">552</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:28.</i> that are burned. And there is a reason.<br><br><i>In the three places where the Torah says </i>ואחרי כן יבוא אל המחנה<i> (and afterward he may come into the camp), it does so right after it says that he must wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water. This is so that one will not err and think that the command to wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water is only an edict from the King that has nothing to do with his uncleanness<sup class="footnote-marker">553</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Acharei Mot 66.</i>.</i>

Klal 241

And with several commandments, the Torah clarifies that they apply to a proselyte, but many commandments do not clarify this.
And moreover with many commandments, it is written <b>לדורותיכם</b> (for your generations) to indicate that they are applicable for all generations, but many commandments come without this word and do not clarify this.

Klal 242

Repeated sections – the sages of blessed memory homiletically interpret all words in the second section as if they were repeated in the first section.
Like the section about a burnt offering of a flock<sup class="footnote-marker">554</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:10.</i>; it could have been included in the earlier section about a burnt offering of the herd<sup class="footnote-marker">555</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:3.</i>, and they homiletically interpret that for all that is written with respect to an offering of a flock in the first section, it means to say it as if it were repeated <b>זכר זכר</b> and <b>תמים תמים</b>. And moreover, all repetitions that are in both the section about a burnt offering of a herd and the section about a burnt offering of a flock are interpreted homiletically.
And this is the great root of the Oral Law and is profound. Through this come many laws, no number to them, in the Written Law.
For example, with five types of sins, it explains what is written there four times מכל מצוות ה' אשר לא תעשינה (in any of the things which the LORD has commanded not to be done)<sup class="footnote-marker">556</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:2, 4:13, 4:22, 4:27.</i> for four homiletical interpretations.
And when it is written קרנות (horns)<sup class="footnote-marker">557</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:7, 4:18.</i> two times with respect to a sin offering in the interior of the tent of meeting.
And when it is written יסוד מזבח העולה (base of the altar of burnt offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">558</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:7, 4:18, 4:25.</i> three times with respect to a sin offering in the exterior of the tent of meeting.
And when it is written in the section about the sin-offering for the anointed priest, the sin-offering for the assembly, and in Leviticus 6:4 three times<sup class="footnote-marker">559</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:12, 4:21, 6:4.</i> מחוץ למחנה, it has three homiletical interpretations.
And when it is written about a sin offering in the exterior of the tent of meeting three times<sup class="footnote-marker">560</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:24, 4:29, 4:33.</i> and a guilt offering for leprosy one time<sup class="footnote-marker">561</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:13.</i>, four times it says to kill it in the place where they kill the burnt-offering to teach four things.
And when it is written three times וכפר עליו הכהן (the priest shall make atonement for him)<sup class="footnote-marker">562</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:26, 4:31, 4:35.</i> and three times וכפר ונסלח (make atonement and be forgiven)<sup class="footnote-marker">563</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>, there are three homiletical interpretations.




























And furthermore, I already mentioned many like these in the rules that are mentioned in the preceding chapters. And in the chapter about leprosy of garments, בגד (garment) is written eight times, עור (skin) is written seven times, and שתי וערב (warp and woof) is written seven times. And with all of those that I considered came homiletical interpretations of the <i>Sifra</i>, the number of interpretations equaling the number of repetitions, never more and never less.
And the way of the <i>Sifra</i> is to always explain all of the homiletical interpretations of a word the first time the word appears. For example, the first time when it is written על העצים אשר על האש (upon the wood that is on the fire)<sup class="footnote-marker">564</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:8.</i>, it homiletically interprets it four times. And the first time when it is written ירחץ במים (wash with water)<sup class="footnote-marker">565</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:9.</i>, it homiletically interprets it two times. And the commentaries of <i>Sifra</i> maintain that it derives all of the homiletical interpretations from the same word. For example, when it is written על העצים אשר על האש (upon the wood that is on the fire)<sup class="footnote-marker">566</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:8.</i> it homiletically interprets it four times. And they were very much pressed to remove these homiletical interpretations, but it was not possible. And they based most of their interpretations on the letters ה and the ו, etc. It seemed as if the foundations of the tradition were built on cobwebs. And the truth is that the <i>Sifra</i> will never make an interpretation anywhere more than once. And when there are many homiletical interpretations of one word, we can be certain that this word is repeated in a topic or a narrative or the Torah such and such times equal to the number of homiletical interpretations. And the <i>Sifra</i> always collects and organizes them the first time the word appears.

Klal 243

And moreover, the sages of blessed memory homiletically interpret the language changes that are found in a topic and also set the number of homiletical interpretations to equal the number of language changes.
For example, in the chapter about burnt offerings and peace offerings, it comes nine times with the language הקרבה instead of הבאה, six times with a pronoun and three times without a pronoun. And they interpret that this is for nine types of mixtures, that six are not offered as a sacrifice and three are offered as a sacrifice.
And moreover, the word דם (blood) comes three times and three times דמו (its blood) with a pronoun. And it is interpreted that three types of mixtures are offered as a sacrifice and three types are not offered. (Because the pronoun excludes mixtures).
And for all of the times in which the Torah talks about סמך (to lay), it is written וסמך את ידו except for three times, where it is written וסמך ידו for three homiletical interpretations.
And three times it writes על ראש with a טפחא (tipkhah - the Aramaic name for a particular cantillation note) on the word על, for three interpretations.
And moreover in six places where it considers a sin offering and a burnt offering of a bird, there are language changes for each one, for a total of six homiletical interpretations.
And also, it was customary that they said all of their homiletical interpretations at one time with the first word that they chanced upon, and the number of homiletical interpretations was equal to the number of changes in language.

Klal 244

And the <i>Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 3b</i> teaches that according to Rabbi Yoshiya three judges are needed, since it is written אלהים (court) three times in the Scripture. And Rabbi Yonatan says ראשון תחילה נאמר ואין דורשין תחילות (The first instance of the word אלהים is stated first, and one does not derive tallies by counting the first mention of a word). And the Talmud continues<br>נימא בדורשין תחילות קמפלגי. לא. דכולי עלמא אין דורשין תחלות. אמר לך ר' יאשיה אם כן נימא "ונקרב בעל הבית אל השופט". מאי "אל האלהים". שמע מינה למנינא<br>(Let us say that Rabbi Yoshiya and Rabbi Yonatan disagree with regard to whether one derives tallies from the first mention. No, actually everyone holds that one does not derive tallies from the first mention. Rabbi Yoshiya could have said to you “If it is true that one does not derive tallies by counting the first mention, then let it say in Exodus 22:7, ונקרב בעל הבית אל השופט – using the word השופט (judge) instead of האלהים. Why does it say אל האלהים? Conclude from this that the word האלהים was chosen to mean <i>for the tally</i>.”)
And when we are meticulous with all of the homiletical interpretations of the <i>Sifra</i> that were mentioned, we can see that they are in agreement with the method of the <i>Gemara</i> - that in every place in which the first mention of a word is needed for its own right, the first mention is not homiletically interpreted (only that which comes afterwards is homiletically interpreted). And any place where there is a certain change in the language, the first mention is also homiletically interpreted. For example, when it says הקרבה in place of הבאה, etc., it also interprets its first mention. And when one examines our commentary in all places where the previous two rules are applicable, one will find this to be true.

Klal 245

And it is known that the author of an anonymous passage of <i>Sifra</i> is Rabbi Yehuda, and he provides homiletical interpretations for juxtapositions of verses in the Torah only when the interpretations are evident from the context or the verse is extraneous (as one finds in the <i>Babylonian Talmud Berachos 21a and Yevamos 4a</i>). And moreover, one does not find homiletical interpretations like these in <i>Sifra</i>.
Except for the sentence Leviticus 23:3 about the Sabbath, that falls between two verses about appointed seasons.
And the sentence Leviticus 23:22 about not wholly reaping the corner of one’s field, which is off-topic.
And the sentence, Leviticus 19:20 about a designated bondmaid, which is out of place.
And the homiletical interpretation that is made with respect to juxtapositions of verses in Leviticus 19-20 are the words of Rabbi Nechemia.
And the topic of <i>מקרא נדרש לפניו</i> (a verse is interpreted in reference to the clause that immediately precedes it). And the topic of <i>גורעים ומוסיפים ודורשים</i> (subtract, add, and homiletically interpret), and it is according to the ways of grammar and language.<br><br><i>גורעים ומוסיפים ודורשים is a way of homiletically interpreting the Torah through subtracting letters from one word and adding them to another word.</i>

Klal 246

In order to explain the Scripture, the sages of blessed memory use all of the methods that linguists and philologists use.
Like parenthetical expressions, parallel hemistiches, and ellipsis.
And that sometimes it changes the grammar for the sake of pairing the words, as Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra writes, etc.

Klal 247

And moreover, the direction of their words is always with the <i>Baal HaTaamim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">567</sup><i class="footnote">The Baal HaTaamim was an otherwise anonymous person to whom some Rishonim and Acharonim refer. https://mishpacha.com/all-the-right-notes-the-two-trops-for-the-ten-commandments/#_edn9</i>.
And in a place where a קמץ vowel comes without an אֶתְנַחְתָּא (pause) at the end of the chapter, there will be a slight pause, according to their commentaries.
And see the depth of their wisdom when they interpret ורחץ במים (bathe in water)<sup class="footnote-marker">568</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 15:16.</i> (with respect to a man who has a seminal emission) to mean <i>in the waters of a ritual bath</i>, but they do not interpret it as such for the ten times where it is written ורחץ במים previous to it. This is because for all of them (except a seminal emission), there is a טעם מפסיק (pause) with the word במים.
And any place where there is a difference between how a word is written and how it is pronounced, they will interpret both of them:
As when they explain אשר לו חומה (that is in the walled city)<sup class="footnote-marker">569</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 25:30.</i> – לא is with the letter א.
נסכה (and the drink-offering thereof shall be of wine)<sup class="footnote-marker">570</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 23:13.</i> - ונסכו.
ידו (his hands)<sup class="footnote-marker">571</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:21.</i> – ידיו.
And the pronunciation will always be according to the plain meaning, while the way a word is written will be according to a homiletical interpretation. And with respect to <b>שערה</b> (hair)<sup class="footnote-marker">572</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:4.</i>, Rabbi Shimon interprets it according to how it is written, while the sages interpret it according to how it is pronounced.
And moreover, they make interpretations based on whether a word is with a vowel or without a vowel - <b>לוא</b> יגיד (if he do not utter it)<sup class="footnote-marker">573</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:1.</i>.

Klal 248

And the sages of blessed memory explain any <b>המלות המושאלות</b> (metaphoric words) with respect to the topic from which they are borrowed:
Like <b>על פי</b> (through) and <b>על דבר</b> (because of) – they explain them from the topic of speech.
והקמות את המשכן <b>כמשפטו</b> (And you shall rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion thereof)<sup class="footnote-marker">574</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 26:30.</i> – from the topic of law and judgement, etc.
And with <b>בשמות המשותפים</b>(homonyms) they show connections, like the noun <b>פרד</b> (mule) because it is sterile and thus separate. And moreover, <b>ערב</b> (evening), since it is mixed up in appearance, etc.

Klal 249

<i>Introduction to the 365 rules that follow</i>:<br><b>והשמות הנרדפים</b> (synonymous nouns): There is to each a special fence in which with respect to these fences a myriad of homiletical interpretations were built. And moreover, with <b>הלשונות השוות</b> (similar languages), one sees after investigation that there are in them a difference between when it uses one language and when it uses another language. And we already began investigating this and discovered many of these hidden in plain view in the Scripture. And in the preface to the Book of Isaiah which we published, we established that the name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous run into it, and is set up on high<sup class="footnote-marker">575</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 18:10.</i> in the phraseology of the Scripture, to see that for each and every word there is a special fence, and to enlighten in the spirit of God.
And here, I have researched, interpreted, and organized the rules that are found in <i>Sifra</i> and have found 365 comprehensive rules (besides the rules which were taken from the words of the sages of blessed memory that are not topics in this composition at the present; that here, I will only speak of the rules that are needed to understand the words of <i>Sifra</i>, and that which <i>Sifra</i> has taken from words of the sages of blessed memory.) And here I am going to organize for you these rules, clarifying the boundaries between similar languages and their differences and the differences between the synonymous nouns, verbs, and other parts of speech. And with the 248 rules which we made clear until now about the grammar of the language, we came up with 613 rules. And they are 613 bright, shining, brilliant, sparkling lights on the horizon of the language. To enlighten all from darkness and to open eyes, with which no small matter or great matter is found from all of the myriad of homiletical interpretations that are clarified in <i>Sifra</i> that is not built upon these rules, or linguistics and its foundations.
<b>אדם – איש</b> (man): According to the grammarians, feminine language cannot be derived from masculine language with respect to nouns. And from this, one can recognize with respect to the names of living things which is a noun and which is an adjective (see rule 276) – the word <b>אדם</b> (man), in which the noun אדמה (ground) cannot be derived from it, is a noun, while the word <b>איש</b> (man), in which the noun אשה (woman) can be derived from it, is an adjective. And through this stand several differences between these two names.

Klal 250

The noun <b>אדם</b> (person) includes male and female, while the noun <b>איש</b> (man) excludes a woman, unless an amplificatory expression comes.

Klal 251

A human can be called by the noun <b>אדם</b> (person) from the moment of his birth, while the noun <b>איש</b> excludes a child.

Klal 252

The noun <b>אדם</b> (person) is unique to human beings alone. And the noun <b>איש</b> (man) in its broad meaning also includes animals and angels, etc.

Klal 253

The noun <b>איש</b> (man) comes to link the modifier to the word that it modifies (איש צדיק - righteous man, איש תם – whole-hearted man) and to link the property to the buyer ( עבד איש- servant of a man, עולת איש - burnt offering of a man). This is not so with the noun <b>אדם</b>. And in the place where it says אדם בליעל (a base person)<sup class="footnote-marker">576</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 6:12.</i>, it is a special exception.<br><br><i>According to the Midrash of Proverbs, an אדם בליעל is a person who speaks loshon hora (evil speech)<sup class="footnote-marker">577</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 10.</i>.</i>

Klal 254

The noun <b>איש</b> (man) comes to indicate an impersonal subject - וישאלו איש לרעהו (and they asked each other of their welfare)<sup class="footnote-marker">578</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 18:7.</i> - it is interpreted that they asked <i>אחד לרעהו</i> <i>(each other)</i>. And moreover, it applies to laws - איש מבית ישראל (What man soever there be of the house of Israel)<sup class="footnote-marker">579</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 17:3.</i>. This is not so with the noun <b>אדם</b>. And when it is written אדם מכם (When any man of you brings)<sup class="footnote-marker">580</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:2.</i>, there is a homiletical interpretation.<br><br><i>Leviticus 1:2 says,</i>דבר אל בני ישראל ואמרת אלהם אדם כי יקריב מכם קרבן ליהוה מן הבהמה מן הבקר ומן הצאן תקריבו את קרבנכם<i> (Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When any man of you brings an offering to the LORD, you shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd or of the flock), using the wordאדם to for “man” as an impersonal subject instead of the word </i>איש<i>. The homiletical interpretation is that the word אדם is used in order to indicate that proselytes are also included in the verse<sup class="footnote-marker">581</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 10.</i>.</i>

Klal 255

The noun <b>אדם</b> (man) sometimes refers to all human beings, and the sages of blessed memory will homiletically interpret it to mean Adam, the first man.

Klal 256

The noun <b>אדם</b> (man) in its precise meaning only refers to an Israelite who is observant in the Torah and its commandments. And moreover, it teaches about his deeds from the perspective that he is a man with free will and intelligence.

Klal 257

And thus, in a place where the noun <b>איש</b> (man) comes to connect an adjective to that which it modifies, it will not exclude an אשה (woman).
And moreover, in a place of attribution of property.
And moreover, in a place that indicates an impersonal subject.
And moreover, in a place that comes to indicate the general – it will not exclude an אשה.
And this will be recognized: 1) Through the context, like איש מכם.
2) Or through a verb that comes after it in plural.
3) Or through repeating <b>איש איש</b>.
And with this, a child is also included. And the reason for this is that any place where the noun איש is written, there is to say that it comes to indicate precisely the gender, איש ולא אשה (man and not a woman) (in particular in a place where this is proven from the fact that the noun אדם does not come). But with all of these that were mentioned, it is not possible to write the name אדם (as was discussed in rules 253 and 254). And with this, there is to say that the noun will not come to indicate the gender but only to establish a connection between the adjective and that which it modifies or to indicate the general, etc., so it will not exclude a woman.
However, for a child, it is understood that also with a noun that comes to indicate attribution of property, it will exclude him.<br><br>האיש המטהר <i>(the man that is to be cleansed) is an example in which the noun איש (man) comes to connect the adjective to that which it modifies<sup class="footnote-marker">582</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Metzora 43.</i>. </i>איש עבד <i>(slave of a man) is an example in which the noun איש (man) comes to give attribution of property<sup class="footnote-marker">583</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Tzav 87.</i>.</i>

Klal 258

Whenever the noun <b>אדם</b> (man) comes <i>versus</i> the noun <b>בהמה</b> (animal), it comes in its broad meaning and idol worshippers are also included.
And moreover, in a place where it refers to all of the species - for example, if it is written <b>האדם</b>, the prefix ה teaches that it is referring to all of the species.

Klal 259

The noun <b>נפש</b> (soul) includes adults and children, male and female.
And the noun <b>נפש</b> comes <i>versus</i> the physical body.
And with respect to a dead body, it is referring to the blood.
But the noun <b>נפשות</b> never comes in plural when referring to dead bodies.

Klal 260

Any place where it is written <b>דבר אל בני ישראל</b> (speak to the children of Israel), it comes to exclude idol worshippers, unless there is an amplificatory expression somewhere to include them.

Klal 261

In its precise meaning, בני means sons, and not daughters and not proselytes.
And any place where it is written <b>בני ישראל</b> (children of Israel), it needs an amplificatory expression to include women and proselytes, or else the Torah will clarify there explicitly that the law also applies to a proselyte.

Klal 262

And moreover, any place where the noun <b>בן</b> or <b>בנים</b> (son/sons) comes, it will always be precise that it is a child, unless it is in a place where logic dictates that it comes in its broad meaning.
And when the noun <b>בן</b> or <b>בת</b> comes in construct state with another noun, it sometimes has a different meaning, like בן חיל (hero), בת חיל (heroine), בת בליעל (wicked woman). Therefore, it needs to be written בת איש כהן (And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the harlot, she profanes her father: she shall be burnt with fire)<sup class="footnote-marker">584</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 21:9.</i>; if it had written בת כהן, one could make a mistake and think that she herself has some portion in the priesthood unless she profanes herself.

Klal 263

And there is a difference between the noun <b>בן</b> (son) and the noun <b>זרע</b> (seed):
The noun זרע (seed) includes also grandchildren. And the noun בן includes only sons.
And the nounזרע in its precise meaning includes only <i>kosher</i> descendants.
And with respect to animals, the name בן (son of) is only ascribed to the mother.

Klal 264

Any place where it says <b>אהרן ובניו</b> (Aaron and his children), and it is a commandment which applies for all generations - it means the high priest, who stands in place of Aaron, and the regular priests, who stand in place of his sons, unless it is a commandment that was given in the desert to Aaron alone.

Klal 265

And any place where it says <b>אהרן הכהן</b> (Aaron the priest) and it is a commandment which applies for all generations, the commandment is directed at a regular priest, since the adjective הכהן (the priest) is superfluous and it comes to say that it is directed at Aaron only because he is a priest, not because he is Aaron who has his special merits. But when it says <b>בני אהרן הכהן</b> (sons of Aaron the priest), it is because of the merits of his high priesthood.

Klal 266

And it sometimes uses the words <b>בני אהרן</b> (sons of Aaron) and sometimes <b>כהנים</b> (priests) and sometimes <b>בני אהרן הכהנים</b> (sons of Aaron, the priests) and sometimes<b>הכהנים בני אהרן</b> (the priests, sons of Aaron). And we clarified that any place where it says <b>בני אהרן הכהנים</b>, it comes to exclude those with a physical defect, since whenever it says <b>בני אהרן</b>, they include offspring of a forbidden marriage with a priest and priests with physical defects. And the noun <b>כהנים</b> in its precise meaning does not include those with a physical defect, and in its broad meaning also includes those with a physical defect. And when it comes to clarify the name<b>בני אהרן</b>, it comes in its precise meaning, but when it says <b>הכהנים בני אהרן</b>, the words <b>בני אהרן</b> come to clarify that the noun <b>כהנים</b> comes in its broad meaning and also includes those with a physical defect.

Klal 267

There is a difference between the noun <b>קהל</b> (assembly) and the noun <b>עדה</b> (congregation), as there is a difference between מקהיל (assemble) and מיעד (appoint):
מקהיל gathers men through a voice and trumpets (and this is what distinguishes it between <b>אסף</b> and <b>קבץ</b> (collection), which also include a collection of things which have no intelligence), but מיעד is with an invitation to convene at a time.
And moreover, <b>קהל</b> is a gathering of the multitudes, while <b>עדה</b> is a gathering of the people in which their elders are in charge.
And moreover, for this reason the noun <b>עדה</b> refers to the Sanhedrin alone. And in particular, whenever they are mentioned together as synonyms, it will always use the noun <b>עדה</b> for the Sanhedrin. And also, the Sanhedrin are of the <b>קהל</b> when there are no rulers at that time.

Klal 268

There is a difference between <b>עדה</b> (congregation) and <b>עדת ישראל</b> (congregation of Israel): <b>עדת ישראל</b> means only the great <i>Sanhedrin</i>. And the noun <b>עדה</b> alone also includes a lesser <i>Sanhedrin</i>.<br><br><i>The Jewish Supreme Court, called the “great Sanhedrin”, consisted of 71 judges. Each lower court, called a “lesser Sanhedrin”, consisted of 23 judges.</i>

Klal 269

And there is a disagreement regarding the noun <b>קהל</b> (assembly) as to whether even one tribe of Israel can be called a <b>קהל</b> or only the majority of Israel.

Klal 270

The noun <b>עם</b> (people) in its broad meaning includes all individuals of the people, and in its precise meaning does not include priests and Levites at all. For instance, when it says<b>עם הקהל</b> (people of the assembly), the noun עם comes to modify the noun קהל, which includes everyone – with this עם, it comes in its precise meaning, and priests and Levites are excluded. But when it comes alone, עם sometimes comes in its broad meaning and everyone is included.
And when it wants to distinguish between the dignitaries and the multitudes, it calls the multitudes with the name <b>עם הארץ</b>.

Klal 271

And all of this is when the noun <b>עם</b> (people) comes by itself, that then it also comes when referring to a collection of individuals. But when it says <b><a dir="rtl">עם ה׳</a></b> and moreover <b>עמך</b> with a pronoun referring to God – it includes all of the people with their priests.
And moreover, sometimes the noun <b>ישראל</b> (Israel) comes <i>versus</i> the noun <b>בני אהרן</b> (sons of Aaron). But when it says <b>עמך בית ישראל</b> (Your people, the house of Israel) – it also includes priests.
And <b>עמיו</b> (His people) is plural for respect, like אדוניו (his master). And its plural is <b>בעממיך</b> (your peoples) with a repeating of the letter <b>מ</b>.

Klal 272

The noun <b>מחנה</b> (camp) refers to the people when they rested in a field and refers to Israel as long as they dwelt in the desert. And there is the whole camp and parts of the camp, since every tribe is called a <b>מחנה</b>. And after they established the Tabernacle, there were three camps – priests, Levites, and Israelites. And any place where it says <b>מחוץ למחנה</b>, it is explained according to its context.
And there is a difference between <b>מחוץ לעיר</b> (outside of the city) and <b>מחוץ למחנה</b> (outside of the camp): <b>מחוץ למחנה</b> is precisely in a place that is considered a מחנה according to Torah Law, for instance, Jerusalem or a walled city.

Klal 273

For the noun <b>גר</b> (stranger), the essence of the word is that one lives in a land, near or far, that is not his own. And the Canaanites who accepted upon themselves the seven commandments of Noah are called <b>גר תושב</b>, while anyone who comes from afar and converts to Judaism is called a <b>גר צדק</b>. And both of them can be called by just the name <b>גר</b>.
And it is always learned from its context whether it means a <b>גר צדק</b> or a <b>גר תושב</b>.
Or through the repeating of the noun <b>גר</b> twice, once for a <b>גר צדק</b> and once for a <b>גר תושב</b>.
Or through היקש (analogy), etc.

Klal 274

And there is a difference between <b>הגר בתוככם</b> and <b>הגר אתכם</b> (the stranger that resides among you): The language <b>הגר אתכם</b> comes on someone who converted now, while the language <b>הגר בתוככם</b> teaches that he was converted this many days ago. And moreover, the language <b>גר בישראל</b> (convert in Israel) teaches that he converted long ago.

Klal 275

The noun <b>זקן</b> sometimes means old people and sometimes means leaders of the people and their sages. And there is a rule in this: Any place where the noun זקן is not in construct state and is without a pronoun and is without the definite article ה, it is usually understood as old in years (unless it is in a place where there is proof that it refers to wisdom, as with the repeating of the language מפני שיבה תקום והדרת פני זקן – “You shall rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man”, as we explained)<sup class="footnote-marker">585</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 19:32.</i>. But any place where it comes with a pronoun or is in construct state or is with the definite article ה, it is intended to mean esteemed and superlative in wisdom, except when it speaks of the elders of idol worshippers or of evil Israelites, since then they are the elders only according to the people.

Klal 276

With names of living things, one is able to distinguish between the name it is called from the day it is born – in which its feminine gender cannot be derived from its masculine gender (like <b>גמל שפן חזיר שור ושה</b>, and <b>ארנבת יונה חסידה</b>, which are said for a male and for a female) - and the adjective specifying whether it is adult, which can be found in feminine gender (like <b>פר פרה, כשב כשבה, לביא לביאה</b>):
The noun <b>כבש</b> (lamb) is in its first year, and after its first year, it is called an <b>איל</b> (hart). And when the sages of blessed memory say that also a newborn is called an <b>איל</b>, this is in the language of man, but in the language of the Torah, it is an adjective denoting power and growth. And moreover the name <b>שעיר</b> (goat).
But <b>צאן</b> (flock) is a species name, and thus it adds ואם מן הצאן..כשבה או שעירה (from the flock, a lamb or a goat)<sup class="footnote-marker">586</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:6.</i> to teach that one that is deaf or dwarfish is also <i>kosher</i>.

Klal 277

And moreover, the nouns <b>עגל - פר</b> (male calf - bull) are used according to whether he is an adult; in the beginning, he is an עגל and afterwards, he becomes a פר. And it is in the second year according to Rabbi Eliezer and in the third year according to the sages.

Klal 278

And there is a disagreement with respect to when one says <b>עגל בן בקר</b> (bull-calf) and <b>פר בן בקר</b> (young bullock):
There are some who say that for an עגל בן בקר – the word בן is like בן חיל (hero); an עגל that is a בקר, meaning that it becomes an adult in its second year according to the sages. And פר בן בקר – the word בן indicates <i>young</i> like בני יונה (young pigeons), בני נשר (young vultures), and it is in its third year.
And there are some who say a בן בקר – is an עגל from the בקר species, since עגל is found with respect to other species like <b>גדי, עיר, כפיר עופר</b>, and the Torah never mentions sacrifices of a פר alone, only sacrifices of a פר בן בקר.

Klal 279

<b>כבש כבשים</b> (lamb/sheep); there are fourteen times in the Torah where the letter <b>ש</b> precedes the letter <b>ב</b> in this word. And I explained that <b>כשב וכשבים</b> tends to be more of a species name and another species name will always come next to it, like בקר בכשבים ובעיזים (of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats)<sup class="footnote-marker">587</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 22:19.</i>. And in a place where it does not come with this meaning, it will come from the perspective of the strength of its body and its fat tail, and it will come to include the fat tail.

Klal 280

<b>וכבשים ועזים</b> (sheep and goats) and morevover <b>תורים ובני יונה</b> (turtledoves and young pigeons) – the name of these species do not come in singular, because they are adjectives, as it appears to me. Not so with a noun, as when it says ויהי לי שור וחמור צאן(And I have oxen, and asses and flocks)<sup class="footnote-marker">588</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 32:6.</i>.<br><br><i>When the Torah says <b>וכבשים ועזים</b>, the Malbim considers them to be adjectives for the noun צאן (flock). And when the Torah says <b>תורים ובני יונה</b>, the Malbim considers them to be adjectives for the noun עוף (bird)<sup class="footnote-marker">589</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 77.</i>.</i>

Klal 281

<b>תורים ובני יונה</b> (turtledoves or of young pigeons)<sup class="footnote-marker">590</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:14.</i> are two separate families of this species. The יונה (pigeon) is domestic; the תור (turtledove) is not. The תור is a bird that migrates but not the יונה.
And בני יונה are the young of the species, like בן ראמים, בני צאן, בני נשר. And since it is always written תורים ובני יונה and it never reverses the order – this implies that תורים (turtledoves) are adults and בני יונה (young pigeons) are young.<br><br><i>According to Rule 199, the way of the Scripture is to always speak in such a way that if it mentions two things, the novelty will always be mentioned second. So since the Scripture always mentions </i>תורים <i>before</i> בני יונה<i>, it must mean that </i>בני יונה<i> is the novelty. Suppose that </i>תורים<i> (turtledoves) were to include young turtledoves. Then </i>בני יונה<i> (young pigeons) would not be a novelty, a contradiction. Hence, </i>תורים<i> must include only adults whenever it is mentioned with </i><a dir="rtl">בני יונה</a><sup class="footnote-marker">591</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 74.</i>.

Klal 282

According to the sages of the <i>Gemara</i>, there is a difference between <b>עוף</b> and <b>צפור</b> (bird): <b>עוף</b> is a category and includes the clean and the unclean, while צפור only includes the clean (unless it says <b>צפור שמים</b> or <b>צפור כנף</b>). And there is a disagreement about this in <i>Sifre</i> and in the <i>Jerusalem Talmud</i>. And according to <i>Sifra</i>, <b>צפור</b> is also a category.

Klal 283

The noun <b>חיה</b> (animal) and the noun <b>בהמה</b> (animal) are sometimes used as the name of a category and sometimes as the name of a species:
That is, the noun <b>חיה</b> sometimes will include all living creatures which are on land, even a bird.
And sometimes, it will include a <b>חיה</b> and <b>בהמה</b> alone.
And sometimes it will be a special name for creatures of the desert.
And moreover, the noun <b>בהמה</b> as a category name will also include the <b>חיה</b>. And sometimes it is a special name for an animal that dwells alone. And any place where the noun בהמה comes <i>versus</i> the noun אדם, it is the name of a category. And all is according to the context of the Scripture - that from the context, it is understood whether it is the name of a category or the name of a species.

Klal 284

The human being, even though it says <b>נפש חיה</b> (living soul)<sup class="footnote-marker">592</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 2:7.</i> about him, he is not called a חיה (a human being is not called according to his superficial appearance, according to Maimonides in the <i>Laws of Forbidden Foods, Mishnah Torah</i>).
And sea creatures are called a <b>חיה אשר במים</b>. And the language <b>נפש חיה אשר במים</b> (living creatures that are in the waters)<sup class="footnote-marker">593</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 11:10.</i> also includes creatures of the sea that have the appearance of a human.
And the language בהמה also includes creatures of the sea, since it needed to sayמכל הבהמה אשר על הארץ (among all the beasts that are on the earth)<sup class="footnote-marker">594</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 11:2.</i>.

Klal 285

The noun <b>בהמה</b> (beast) and moreover the noun <b>חיה</b> (living thing) include also hybrids. And if they come as category names, they include also hybrids of a חיה and a בהמה together.

Klal 286

The noun בהמה (animal) in its precise meaning means after the animal exits the womb to the air of the world, and in its broad meaning includes a fetus in the womb of its mother. For example, whenever it saysכל הבהמה (any animal), it includes also the fetus.

Klal 287

The noun <b>אהל מועד</b> (tent of meeting) sometimes means precisely the Tent of Meeting that was in the desert and sometimes comes <i>for example</i> and the same applies with respect to the Temple that was built afterwards. And the rule in this is that anywhere in which it comes only to indicate the place – it will come <i>for example</i>. But if it comes because of the holiness of the place, then it will be possible to err and think that it means precisely the Tent of Meeting, that its holiness is different than the holiness of the Temple, so it will need an amplificatory expression to include the Temple.<br><br><i>Leviticus 6:23 says, וכל חטאת אשר יובא מדמה אל אהל מועד לכפר בקדש לא תאכל באש תשרף (And no sin-offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place, shall be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire). The words אהל מועד (tent of meeting) indicate only the tent of meeting, while לכפר בקדש (to make atonement in the holy place) is an amplificatory expression to include also the Temple, in accordance with Rule 287<sup class="footnote-marker">595</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Tzav 74.</i>.</i>

Klal 288

The phrase <b>חצר אהל מועד</b>(court of the tent of meeting) in its precise meaning does not include the Temple chambers that were built on unconsecrated ground but were open to consecrated ground.

Klal 289

There is a difference between <b>משכן</b> (Tabernacle) and <b>אהל מועד</b> (Tent of Meeting): <b>משכן</b> comes with respect to its structure, that it is made to be carried and to be a dwelling place in its time of resting. And the noun <b>אהל מועד</b> refers to its purpose, that it is designated for the Divine Presence there.
And thus, the noun <b>משכן</b> is used in any place where it speaks about its structure or about journeys, while the noun <b>אהל מועד</b> is used in any place where it speaks about the services and the sacrifices.

Klal 290

The noun <b>מזבח</b> (altar) includes the body of the altar, its roof, its walls, and its foundation. And also the ramp is included in <b>מזבח</b> in its broad meaning. But when it describes its parts like the קיר המזבח (wall of the altar), etc., the ramp is not included in the word <b>מזבח</b>.
However, when it says <b>אל המזבח</b> (and not <b>על המזבח</b>) – also the ramp is included. And moreover, it even teaches that it is close to it but not upon it.

Klal 291

<b>ירך המזבח</b> (side of the altar) – the nouns <b>פנים</b> (face), <b>אחור</b> (back), <b>כתף</b> (shoulder), <b>שכם</b> (shoulder), <b>צד</b> (side), <b>ירך</b> (thigh) are borrowed from the body of a human to the altar, which had no limbs.
And with respect to a house, there is a difference between 1) a house in which its length is greater than its width and has before it a courtyard; then the courtyard is called a <b>פנים</b>, the two sides are called כתפי הבית, the parts of the house that are close to the west are called ירכתי הבית, and the western side is called an אחור.
And 2) a house with a square shape; then its western side is called a ירך.
And the altar had its ramp in the south. The southern side of the altar was called פני המזבח, while its northern side was called הירך.

Klal 292

There is a difference between the nouns <b>קדם</b> and <b>מזרח</b> (east): The noun <b>מזרח</b> indicates the sunrise, while the noun <b>קדם</b> indicates that the direction is first in advantage or in place. And since the sun rises in the east, the east is called <b>קדם</b>.
And moreover the noun <b>קדם</b> is used to describe the eastern side of houses and cities, because in ancient times, their openings were to the east. Thus, in a place where it needs to clarify that the eastern side is first, it will say <b>קדמה מזרחה</b> (eastward, toward the sun-rising). And moreover, the noun <b>קדם</b> is not correct with respect to a house where there is no opening to the east.

Klal 293

There is a difference between the nouns <b>עבר . צד . צלע . קצה . סוף . פאה . שפה</b>:
<b>צלע</b> (side) pertains to physical objects that have length, width, and depth. And the most important thing about the noun <b>צלע</b> is the sides.
<b>קצה</b> (end) comes on a surface, and for a square they are the extremities of the four corners.
<b>פאה</b> (corner) comes to indicate the direction of a certain thing.
<b>צד</b> (side) comes on a thing that is alongside another thing.
<b>עבר</b> (beyond) comes on a thing that is extended in length and passes from end to end.
<b>סוף</b> (end) is the opposite of the noun ראשית (beginning), and they refer to the two ends of one length.
<b>שפה</b> (edge) comes on a thread that encircles an object around and around.

Klal 294

There is a difference between <b>פתח</b> (entrance) and <b>דלת</b> (door): The space where one enters is called a <b>פתח</b>, while that which obstructs and locks the space is called a <b>דלת</b>. If a curtain is spread out there, it will say <b>מסך פתח</b> המשכן (screen of the door of the Tabernacle).
Thus, when it is written ושחטו פתח אהל מועד (and kill it at the door of the tent of meeting)<sup class="footnote-marker">596</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 3:2.</i>, it means that the entrance must be open; it does not mean <i>נגד הפתח</i> (against the door), since it is also written לפני אהל מועד (before the tent of meeting)<sup class="footnote-marker">597</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 3:8, 3:13.</i>.

Klal 295

There is a difference between <b>חצרים</b> (villages) and <b>ערי הפרזי</b> (unwalled towns): <b>חצרים</b> are villages in the field where the workers of the land live. And <b>ערי הפרזי</b> are cities in which there is no wall, cities of at least three courtyards, each containing two houses.
And the language <b>עיר חומה</b>(walled city) is not found anywhere in the Hebrew Bible, only<b>עיר מוקף חומה</b> (city surrounded by a wall). Thus, when it is written בית מושב עיר חומה (dwelling-house in a walled city)<sup class="footnote-marker">598</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 25:29.</i>, it means that it was sanctified with the holiness of a walled city.

Klal 296

It is the custom of the language to indicate a connection in time through the prefix ב added to the infinitive - <b>בבואם</b> אל אהל מועד או <b>בגשתם</b> (when they go in to the tent of meeting, or when they come near)<sup class="footnote-marker">599</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 28:43.</i>. And sometimes, it indicates it through the word <b>בעת</b>.
However, if it indicates it through the word <b>ביום</b>, it will be in one of two ways:
1) It means to say that it is precisely on that day, not another day.
2) It comes in its precise meaning – precisely day, and it excludes the night.
And moreover, any place where the word יום is mentioned with the number - יום הראשון , יום השביעי – it will exclude the night.

Klal 297

And there is a difference between <b>עת</b> (time) and <b>יום</b> (day), in that the word <b>עת</b> is said about any portion of time, whether they are times of the year or time overall, while the word <b>יום</b> indicates only a day.

Klal 298

And there is a difference between the word <b>עת</b> (time) and the words <b>כל ימי</b>/<b>כל הימים</b> (all of the days): Whenever it intends to indicate the continuation in time of a certain matter, it will indicate it with the wordsכל ימי / כל הימים. And whenever it intends to indicate when a certain matter with a special characteristic comes in time, it will indicate it with the word <b>עת</b>.

Klal 299

And there is a difference between <b>עת</b>and <b>מועד</b> (time): The word <b>עת</b> indicates a point in time where one is obligated to a certain matter according to the order of nature, while the word <b>מועד</b> indicates a point in time where one is restricted by religion or by agreement.

Klal 300

And there is a difference between <b>יום</b> (day) and <b>בקר</b> (morning): The noun יום is said about all of the day, while the noun בקר is said about the time of waking up early in the morning.
And <b>בין הערבים</b> (dusk) is sometimes from the sixth hour on and sometimes close to evening. And there is a difference between <b>ערב</b> (evening) and <b>בין הערבים</b> (dusk): The noun ערב when it comes <i>versus</i> בוקר divides the daytime into two halves, but the noun ערב when it comes <i>versus</i> the noun יום is literally night. And with this it needs to say בין הערבים to indicate that it is in the afternoon. But when the noun בין הערבים comes <i>versus</i> בוקר, it is close to darkness, since the afternoon is indicated with the word ערב.

Klal 301

And any place where a time is repeated to teach “every” – it will either come without a preposition prefix or the preposition prefix will come only on the first noun, not the second.
And thus, when it is written <b>בבקר בבקר</b>, <b>יום ביום</b>, <b>חדש בחדש</b>, <b>שנה בשנה</b>, the sages of blessed memory do not interpret them as teaching “every”.

Klal 302

Whenever it says <b>יום ביום</b>, it means according to the theme of the day, and it is close with דבר יום ביומו (the duty of every day required)<sup class="footnote-marker">600</sup><i class="footnote">2 Chronicles 8:13.</i>. Only when it says<b>ביומו</b> (on its day) does it mean precisely on that same day and that it does not get postponed for another day. And the same with <b>שבת בשבתו</b> (every Sabbath)<sup class="footnote-marker">601</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 28:10.</i>.

Klal 303

And when it says <b>שנה בשנה</b> (As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him)<sup class="footnote-marker">602</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 25:53.</i>, it means that one is able to enter from the middle of a calendar year to the following calendar year. And this is distinguished from <b>שנה שנה</b>, without the prefix, which comes to teach inclusion and means <i>in all of a year</i>.

Klal 304

And when it says <b>בבקר בבקר</b> (every morning)<sup class="footnote-marker">603</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:5.</i>, the sages of blessed memory interpret this to mean that the second noun בוקר clarifies the first: The noun בוקר in its broad meaning will mean before noon (that from then onwards begins the afternoon and evening), and in its precise meaning will mean literally the time of waking up early in the morning, so it means that <i>this</i> בוקר (the first noun) is <i>בבוקר</i> (the second noun), meaning the time of waking up early in the morning.

Klal 305

And moreover, whenever it says <b>ביום ביום</b> (every day), it means that this day will be in the daytime, not in the morning, because the noun יום in its broad meaning includes all of the day and in its precise meaning means <i>versus</i> morning and begins after midday. And whenever it is written ביום ביום, it means to say that it will be in the daytime, not in the morning.
And when it is written <b>ביום השבת ביום השבת</b> יערכנו (Every sabbath day he shall set it in order)<sup class="footnote-marker">604</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 24:8.</i>, they interpret ביום השבת יערכנו to be the beginning of a new statement.<br><br><i>Leviticus 24:7-8 says,</i>ונתת על המערכת לבנה זכה והיתה ללחם לאזכרה אשה ליהוה. ביום השבת ביום השבת יערכנו לפני יהוה תמיד מאת בני ישראל ברית עולם<i> (And you shall put pure frankincense with each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial-part, even an offering made by fire to the LORD. Every sabbath day he shall set it in order before the LORD continually; it is from the children of Israel, an everlasting covenant), using the words </i>ביום השבת ביום השבת<i> יערכנו for “Every Sabbath day he shall set it in order”. The Malbim is saying in Rule 305 that the sages homiletically interpret the first </i>ביום השבת<i> to be part of verse Leviticus 24:7, while the second </i>ביום השבת<i> is the beginning of verse Leviticus 24:8<sup class="footnote-marker">605</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Emor 229.</i>.</i>

Klal 306

There is a difference between <b>ביום אחד</b> (in one day)<sup class="footnote-marker">606</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 22:28.</i> and <b>ביום ההוא</b> (on the same day)<sup class="footnote-marker">607</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 22:30.</i>. <b>ביום ההוא</b> means the day with the night coming afterwards, while <b>ביום אחד</b> is precisely the day and the night that was before it, as it was when the world was created.
And any place where it says <b>ממחרת</b> (the morrow)<sup class="footnote-marker">608</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:16.</i>, it is precisely the day that is afterwards and not the night at all.

Klal 307

When it says <b>כל הלילה</b> (all of the night) – sometimes it means all of the night literally and sometimes it means part of the night (so when it really means “all of the night”, it is necessary to add כל הלילה עד הבוקר - all of the night until the morning). And the rule in this is that if the emphasis of the expression and its new information is about the start time or that it does not stop in the meantime – possibly it is referring to the start time and it is necessary to clarifyעד הבקר (until the morning).

Klal 308

And moreover, the verb <b>לון</b> (sleep overnight) sometimes means part of the night, so it needs to add עד הבקר (until morning) for it to mean <i>all of the night</i>. And in a place where one cannot make a mistake and think that it means only part of the night, it will add עד הבקר in order to indicate that it does not mean many lodgings, since we find that the verb <b>לון</b> can refer to many nights in a row.

Klal 309

The word <b>תמיד</b> (always) means that the matter will be without interruption. And there is תמיד that is definite without stopping a second, and there is ordinal תמיד which occurs at a special point in time and does not change, like every morning or every Sabbath.
And this is the difference between <b>תמיד</b> (always) and <b>כל הימים</b> (all of the days): <b>כל הימים</b> means that the matter will not be interrupted during a specific time period, while it does not indicate that it is תמיד, not definite תמיד and not ordinal תמיד. And תמיד means that it is permanent, while it does not mean that it will not be interrupted during a specific time period.

Klal 310

There is a difference between ordinary <b>שנה</b> (year), which is always calculated with respect to the calendar year starting with Rosh Hashanah, and <b>בן שנתו</b> (one year-old), in which the year begins on one date and ends on the same date of the following year.

Klal 311

<b>מלאת הימים</b> (And when the days of her purification are fulfilled)<sup class="footnote-marker">609</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 12:6.</i> teaches that the time that is restricted to a certain matter will be completed in the end.
And any place where the noun <b>ימים</b> (days) comes with respect to a year, it means a year that begins at one time and ends at the same time of the following year.

Klal 312

There is a difference between whether <b>טמא</b> (uncleanness) comes on the uncleanness of a corpse - then no prefix will come afterwards - and whether it comes on the uncleanness of the soul – then the prefix ב will come afterwards and it is referring to uncleanness that is the opposite of holiness, as when it refers to immorality and disgusting acts, like ויטמאו במעשיהם (Thus were they defiled with their works)<sup class="footnote-marker">610</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 106:39.</i>. Or from a topic that is sick and disgusting, like prohibited foods.
And any place where the prefix ב comes on the uncleanness of a corpse, there will be a homiletical interpretation.
And sometimes the prefix ל comes on the uncleanness of a corpse, and then it means to say that one may defile oneself for the same thing, like לאביו ולאמו וכו' יטמא (for his mother, and for his father… may he defile himself)<sup class="footnote-marker">611</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 21:2-3.</i>.

Klal 313

The language <b>טומאה</b> (unclean) and <b>שקץ</b> (disgusting) that is said with respect to types of unclean meat is there in order to prohibit also the sauce and gravy that comes out of them.

Klal 314

And the uncleanness of a corpse is never attributed to a people as a whole, only uncleanness that is the opposite of holiness or uncleanness of a consecrated object. For instance, the Torah will say that idol worshippers defile sacred property and the Temple, making them unclean. And whenever the Scripture talks about topics which attribute uncleanness to a people as a whole, they will only come with respect to idol worship, immorality, and murder.
And the language זנות (immorality) which comes with respect to a people as a whole always comes with respect to the idol worship.

Klal 315

The nouns which come in degrees like <b>קודש, חול, טמא, טהור</b> (holy, secular, unclean, clean) – there are in them several levels.
For example, קדשי הקדשים (Holy of Holies) has a holiness just above קדשים קלים (offerings of a lesser sanctity) and קדשים קלים has a holiness just above תרומה (donations), and תרומה just above מעשר (tithes), where the lower level is profane compared with the higher level. And moreover, stringent uncleanness is more profane than lenient uncleanness, and lenient uncleanness is clean compared with it. And it is always necessary to focus on topics in the Scripture from the perspective of the level in which it is speaking.
And moreover, the noun <b>זר</b> (foreign) – is a preposition and is said in reference to something else.

Klal 316

And there are in this certain boundaries also within the language itself:
With uncleanness that exits one’s body, it will talk about a man who is unclean by way of a noun, not by way of a verb. As when it says with respect to men who are unclean as a result of a urethral secretion and women who are unclean as a result of intermenstrual bleeding טמא הוא טמאה היא (he is unclean, she is unclean). And moreover in Leviticus 15:2 (where it does not attribute uncleanness to the action of the priest in intensive conjugation וטִמאו הכהן – the priest shall pronounce him unclean), it says טמא הוא (his issue is unclean).
It will only speak by way of a verb if it speaks words concerning men who are unclean as a result of a urethral secretion or women who are unclean as a result of intermenstrual bleeding or a law in which one remains unclean after ritual immersion.

Klal 317

Something that is in and of itself unclean, which can never acquire cleanness, will always be mentioned by name and will never be in construct state with the adjective or the noun טומאה (unclean) (as with <b>מי הנדה</b> - water of sprinkling, <b>שכבת זרע</b> – flow of seed, <b>ותהי נדתה עליו</b> - and her impurity be upon him, <b>כי יגע באדם</b>). And when the noun טומאה is in construct state (like <b>בטומאת אדם</b>) – it will be uncleanness of a dead body or there will be in it a certain restriction.

Klal 318

Any place where the verb טמא (unclean) comes as a future imperative verb (like <b>יטמא</b> - shall be unclean or <b>וטמא עד הערב</b> – and be unclean until the evening) – it makes it unclean to anyone else. But when it comes as a noun <b>טמא הוא</b> (it is unclean) – sometimes it means unclean to anyone else and sometimes it means that it is invalid but not unclean and that it is unclean in the sense that it is sick and disgusting or the opposite of holiness. And Rabbi Akiva introduces this rule.

Klal 319

And nevertheless, when it says <b>יטמא</b> (shall be unclean) as a verb, it is usually referring to first-grade uncleanness, not the <i>father of uncleanness</i>, unless it clarifies his uncleanness explicitly, like יכבס בגדיו, יטמא שבעת ימים (shall wash his clothes…he shall remain unclean seven days)<sup class="footnote-marker">612</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 15:22-24.</i> or through some other proclamation.<br><br>אב הטומאה<i>, which means “the father of uncleanness” is the highest level of uncleanness besides the uncleanness of a corpse. </i>ראשון לטומאה<i>, which translates into “first-grade uncleanness”, is the uncleanness which comes from touching “the father of uncleanness”.</i>

Klal 320

And moreover, the topic of טהרה (cleanness):
In the Scripture, there is טהור (clean) in reference to חולין (nonconsecrated food), טהור in reference to תרומה (donations), and טהור in reference to קודש (sacred things).
And there is טהור in reference to not conferring uncleanness onto a bed or a seat or garments.
And there is טהור in reference to not conferring uncleanness onto clay vessels, etc.

Klal 321

And moreover, the noun <b>קדש</b> (holiness) is a noun of degree as it appears to me and is understood from its context.
As they learn when it is written ולא יאכל מן הקדשים כי אם רחץ בשרו במים (and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water)<sup class="footnote-marker">613</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 22:6.</i> it speaks about tithes and when it is writtenובא השמש וטהר ואחר יאכל מן הקדשים (And when the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he may eat of the holy things)<sup class="footnote-marker">614</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 22:7.</i> it speaks about donations.
And when it is written וכל זר לא יאכל קדש (There shall no common man eat of the holy thing)<sup class="footnote-marker">615</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 22:10.</i>, it is speaking about the boundary offerings.
When it says אל הקדש מבית לפרכת (into the holy place within the veil)<sup class="footnote-marker">616</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:2.</i>, it is the Temple, and when it says את הקדש את אהל מועד (for the holy place, and the tent of meeting)<sup class="footnote-marker">617</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:20.</i>, it is the Holy of Holies.
And with the noun <b>קדש</b> alone, Rabbi Yehuda and the sages disagree whether all of the Temple is called <b>קדש</b>.
And moreover, when it is written ואכלתם אותם במקום קדוש (And you shall eat it in a holy place)<sup class="footnote-marker">618</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 10:13.</i>, it means <i>by the altar</i>.
And when it says וחטאה בשגגה מקדש השם (and sin through error, in the holy things of the LORD)<sup class="footnote-marker">619</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:15.</i>, it means holy things specially designated for God.
And when it is written במקום קדוש (holy place)<sup class="footnote-marker">620</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:9.</i>, במקום טהור (clean place)<sup class="footnote-marker">621</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 10:14.</i>, Abaye and Rava disagree.

Klal 322

And we find <b>קדש קדשים</b> (most holy)<sup class="footnote-marker">622</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:22.</i> where it means <i>holy like all holy things</i>, and it includes offerings of a lesser sanctity.
And the proper language is always <b>קדשי השם</b> (holy things of the LORD), and when it is written קדשי בני ישראל (holy things of the children of Israel), it comes to exclude idol worshippers.

Klal 323

And we find the language טהרה (cleanness) with respect to the ceasing of physical uncleanness<sup class="footnote-marker">623</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 15:13.</i>.<br><br><i>There are two types of cleanness, physical and spiritual. Most of the time when the Torah talks about cleanness, it means spiritual cleanness. However, when Leviticus 15:13 says,</i>וכי יטהר הזב מזובו<i> (And when he that has an issue is cleansed of his issue), it is talking about physical cleanness<sup class="footnote-marker">624</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Metzora 146.</i>.</i>

Klal 324

And moreover,<b>לפני השם</b> (before the LORD) is said about any place which has no equal. Sometimes, it means the Inner Sanctuary. And sometimes the Temple. And it sometimes refers to all of the Temple, and sometimes the east side of the altar, and sometimes its north side, and sometimes its west side, and sometimes the eastern gate of the Temple Court, and sometimes all of Jerusalem.
And I clarified that in holiness there are many levels, and any place called <b>לפני השם</b> has a higher level of holiness, and it is interpreted everywhere according to its context. And this is clarified in my book <i>Torah Ohr</i> at length.
And any place where it says לפני השם, it excludes a private altar.

Klal 325

And there is a difference between the language <b>טמא</b> (unclean) and the language <b>וטומאתו עליו</b> (having his uncleanness upon him)<sup class="footnote-marker">625</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:20.</i>: טומאתו עליו is not correct when referring to uncleanness of flesh that cannot be corrected through immersion in a ritual bath.
And the language <b>טמא נפש</b> and <b>טומאת נפש</b> (uncleanness of the dead) – it is referring primarily to the blood.

Klal 326

Touching with respect to uncleanness is always expressed as the clean touching the unclean, since being clean imposes the obligation to keep one’s distance from the unclean and never the reverse.
And when it says the reverse וכל אשר יגע בו הזב (And whomsoever he that has the issue touches)<sup class="footnote-marker">626</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 15:11.</i>, the sages of blessed memory explain that it means there is a movement, that we find the verb נגע referring to moving a thing from its place.
And moreover, with respect to holiness, it is proper to say that the holy touches the profane, since the holy needs to be cautious with the profane. And when it says the reverse וכל אשר יגע בבשרה (Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy)<sup class="footnote-marker">627</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:20.</i>, they are forced to explain that it enters inside of it, that touching is about being attached to something else.

Klal 327

There are several differences between <b>דיבור</b> and <b>אמירה</b> (speech):
<b>אמירה</b> is never without reference to another; any place where the verb אמר comes, it means<i>אמור לפלוני</i> (speaking to another). But <b>דיבור</b> can also be without reference to another.
And thus, the sages of blessed memory interpret the word לאמר to mean <i>לאמר לזולת</i> (to speak to another), and furthermore there are several teachings with respect to the word לאמר.

Klal 328

<b>הדיבור</b> (speech) is like a category, and it includes all types of speech – <b>אמירה</b> (talking), <b>עניה</b> (answer), <b>שאלה</b> (question), <b>ציוי</b> (command), <b>הגדה</b> (telling).

Klal 329

And thus, when it says <b>דבר ואמרת</b>, it indicates with the wordדבר that it is dealing with ordinary speech, and with the word ואמרת it indicates what he will say to him in details.
And from this, Rabbi Yehuda reasons that any place where it saysדבר לאמר , a prohibition that is inferred from a positive commandment has the status of a positive commandment.

Klal 330

But when it says <b>אמור ואמרת</b>, it is repeated language, and there will be a homiletical interpretation. And according to the sages of blessed memory, it indicates a law that was taught to Moses at Mount Sinai with no foundation in the Written Law.

Klal 331

And <b>הדיבור</b> (speech) can refer to one word alone, but <b>אמירה</b> (expression) refers only to expressions that can be understood.

Klal 332

The word <b>דבר</b> (speak) indicates an expansion of matters in a way of interpreting, lengthening, and expanding one’s words. Thus, with this it indicates what God spoke with Moses mouth to mouth, namely the teaching of the Oral Law and the specifics of the laws at length. And <b>באמירה</b> (saying/expression) indicates the Written Law according to the language in which it was spoken to Moses.
And according to this, it includes proselytes from ואמרת אליהם (and say to them)<sup class="footnote-marker">628</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 15:2.</i>, through what I explained at length.<br><br><i>Leviticus 15:2 says, </i>דברו אל בני ישראל ואמרתם אלהם איש איש כי יהיה זב מבשרו זובו טמא הוא<i> (Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When any man has an issue out of his flesh, his issue is unclean), using the language דברו אל בני ישראל ואמרתם אליהם for “Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them”. The extra words ואמרתם אליהם</i> <i>(and say to them) are there to include proselytes<sup class="footnote-marker">629</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Metzora 119.</i>.</i>

Klal 333

And therefore, we only find וידבר ה' לאמר (And the LORD spoke … saying) with respect to Moses, since he was the Prophet of the Torah, unlike the rest of the prophets.
And any place where it says וידבר..לאמר, it means that it is a commandment for all generations.

Klal 334

In a place where <b>דיבור</b> and <b>אמירה</b> (speech) come but it is not to another entity, it will be האמירה בלב (speaking with the heart), but not so with דיבור - it will only be so when it is explicit like ודברתי אני עם לבי (and I spoke with my heart).

Klal 335

And all verbs that refer to speech can also refer to speaking to one’s heart.
And דיבור (speech) and אמירה (expression) can be through an intermediary.

Klal 336

The word <b>דבר</b> (speak/speech) sometimes indicates a theme or essence, like על דבר שרי (because of Sarai)<sup class="footnote-marker">630</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 12:17.</i>. And the sages of blessed memory always explained this according to its primary meaning from the theme of pronounced speech, from which it is borrowed. As such are the ways with all metaphoric words (as in Rule 248).<br><br><i>The primary meaning of the word דבר is pronounced speech. The Torah often borrows the word דבר to indicate a theme or essence.</i>

Klal 337

The word <b>דְבַר</b> (matter) sometimes teaches about a complete matter and sometimes teaches about part of a matter. And there is in this a difference between whether it comes as a sentence which obliglates or it comes as a sentence which prohibits. And from this perspective, the word דבר comes as an amplificatory expression.<br><br><i>HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 244 talks about Rule 337 in more detail.</i>

Klal 338

The language <b>זה הדבר</b> (this is the matter) does not come anywhere with respect to commandments that apply for all generations. And when it comes in this way with respect to slaughtering outside of the camp<sup class="footnote-marker">631</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 17:2.</i> and the heads of the tribes<sup class="footnote-marker">632</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 30:2.</i>, it comes for a גזירה שוה (verbal analogy).<br><br><i>Leviticus 17:2 says, </i>דבר אל אהרן ואל בניו ואל כל בני ישראל ואמרת אליהם זה הדבר אשר צוה יהוה לאמר<i> (Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them: This is the thing which the LORD has commanded, saying), saying </i>זה הדבר<i> for “This is the thing”.</i><br><br><i>Numbers 30:2 says, </i>וידבר משה אל ראשי המטות לבני ישראל לאמר זה הדבר אשר צוה יהוה<i> (And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying: This is the thing which the LORD has commanded), saying </i>זה הדבר<i> for “This is the thing”.</i><br><br><i>Leviticus 17:7 says, </i>ולא יזבחו עוד את זבחיהם לשעירם אשר הם זנים אחריהם חקת עולם תהיה זאת להם לדרתם<i> (This shall be a statute for ever to them throughout their generations).</i><br><br><i>The sages make a</i>גזירה שוה <i>(verbal analogy) that since it said </i>זה הדבר<i> in Leviticus 17 pertaining to slaughtering outside of the camp and it applies for all generations, when it says </i>זה הדבר<i> in Numbers 30:2, it must also apply for all generations<sup class="footnote-marker">633</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Acharei Mot 88.</i>.</i>

Klal 339

<b>הדיבור</b> (speaking) when it is done with another can be connected with the prepositions <b>עם</b>, <b>את</b>, <b>אל</b>, or with the prefix <b>ל</b>. But <b>האמירה</b> (saying) can only be connected with the preposition <b>אל</b> or the prefix <b>ל</b>. And the reason for this is because when <b>הדיבור</b>is connected with the prepositions <b>עם</b> or <b>את</b>, the <b>דיבור</b> (speaking) is shared between the two speakers, both exchanging speech with each other. But this is not correct with <b>האמירה</b>, because of that which was explained in Rule 327.

Klal 340

And there is a difference between <b>דיבר אתו</b> and <b>דיבר עמו</b> (speak with him): With<b>דיבר אתו</b>, one begins and he is the primary, while with <b>דיבר עמו</b>, the one who is secondary responds and the primary acknowledges his answer, as is written with בדברי עמך (when I speak with you)<sup class="footnote-marker">634</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 19:9.</i>. And see Rule 579 for the difference between <b>אתו</b> and <b>עמו</b>.

Klal 341

דיבור (speech) that has the letter ב afterwards - it is speech of complaint and not said with respect. And from this, they say it is <i>severe speech</i>.

Klal 342

Any <b>לי</b> (for me) or <b>לו</b> (for him) that is next to דיבור (speak) means <i>for the sake of him</i>, according to <i>Rashi</i>.

Klal 343

There is a difference between when the verb אמר comes with the word אל afterwards and the prefix ל afterwards: And the rule goes according to Rabbi Solomon Pappenheim.<br><br><i>According to Rabbi Solomon Pappenheim, when </i>אמר<i> comes with </i>אל<i> afterwards, it is referring to extensive and intelligent speech. Not so when the prefix letter </i>ל<i> comes afterwards<sup class="footnote-marker">635</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Shemini 28.</i>.</i>

Klal 344

There is a difference between <b>מגיד</b> and <b>אומר ומספר</b> (tell):
<b>מגיד</b> informs of a matter that is not known to the person hearing it and that he wants to know it, since the matter pertains to him.
On the contrary, <b>אומר</b> can also be with respect to a matter that is not news.
<b>מספר</b> can also be with respect to a matter for which there is no purpose in hearing the information.

Klal 345

The verb <b>בטה</b> (utter clearly) refers to severe speech that one’s soul speaks in a time of enthusiasm to do evil or to do good with a vow or with an oath.

Klal 346

The verb <b>פלא</b> (clearly uttered) teaches about clear speech in a matter that requires judgement of an idea or a thought.<br><br><i>For instance, Leviticus 22:21ואיש כי יקריב זבח שלמים ליהוה לפלא נדר או לנדבה בבקר או בצאן תמים יהיה לרצון כל מום לא יהיה בו (And whosoever brings a sacrifice of peace-offerings to the LORD in fulfilment of a vow clearly uttered, or for a freewill-offering, of the herd or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein) uses פלא when talking about the fulfilment of a vow, which requires judgement of an idea or a thought.</i>

Klal 347

There is a difference between <b>הציוי</b> (command) and <b>הדיבור</b>/<b>והאמירה</b> (speak): <b>הציוי</b> is only with matters in which one is being controlled and the command is forcing someone to do something; it is incorrect to use <b>הציוי</b> if one is not doing it because he is being commanded and he is really doing it on his own, for his own benefit.

Klal 348

Nevertheless, we also find with respect to commandments the language דיבור ואמירה (speech and expression). Thus, any place where it uses the language ציוי (command), it will be in one of three ways:
1) when it indicates quickness.
2) or it indicates repetition.
3) or it indicates that it is a commandment for all generations.
But the sections in the Torah which begin with the language צו את בני ישראל (command the children of Israel) require that these three conditions be satisfied together.

Klal 349

There is a difference between צוה (command) in which afterwards comes the word את and צוה in which afterwards comes the prefix ל: The ל afterwards teaches that the one being commanded is to do it for his own sake. And it is not correct to apply the word צוה to oneself, only to others.

Klal 350

Ordinary <b>כפרה</b> (atonement) means with blood that is spilled. And any place where the atonement is not with blood - it will elaborate לכפר על נפשותיכם (to make atonement for your souls).
And we also find כפר with words that are a confession.<br><br><i>Numbers 31:50 says,</i> ונקרב את קרבן יהוה איש אשר מצא כלי זהב אצעדה וצמיד טבעת עגיל וכומז לכפר על נפשתינו לפני יהוה<i> (And we have brought the LORD'S offering, what every man has gotten, of jewels of gold, armlets, and bracelets, signet-rings, ear-rings, and girdles, to make atonement for our souls before the LORD). In this case, the atonement was not with blood, so it had to elaborate “to make atonement for our souls”, in accordance with Rule 350<sup class="footnote-marker">636</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 32.</i>.</i>

Klal 351

The verb <b>כפר</b> (atone) is, according to Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, derived from the noun כופר (ransom), which teaches redemption. And according to the sages of blessed memory, it comes from the topic of cleanliness.

Klal 352

Whenever atonement is for the sake of others, the word <b>עליו</b> (upon it) is written afterwards, and whenever atonement is for the sake of oneself, the word <b>בעד</b> – as in וכפר בעדו (shall make atonement for himself)<sup class="footnote-marker">637</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:11.</i> - is written afterwards.

Klal 353

The word כפרה is never found with respect to a burnt offering, only with respect to sin and guilt offerings. And whenever it is written about burnt offerings לכפר עליו (to make atonement for him) – there will be a homiletical interpretation.

Klal 354

There is a difference between the meaning of <b>וכפר עליו על חטאתו</b> and <b>וכפר עליו מחטאתו</b> (make atonement for him as concerning his sin): When it says על חטאתו - it indicates that He removes the sin itself, while when it says וכפר מחטאתו – it indicates that He removes the attribution of the sin from the sinner.
And thus, in a place where the atonement does not refer to the sin, it is proper for the prefix letter מ to come.

Klal 355

Nevertheless, when it says<b>מחטאתו</b> (from his sin) and <b>מזובו</b> (for his issue), the sages of blessed memory interpret the letter מ to mean <i>some of</i> always (as is written in Rule 606), and it means to say that it atones for only some of the matter.

Klal 356

Forgiveness of sin can be said in many ways. And there is a difference between the language <b>סליחה</b> (forgiveness) and other ways of saying it:
The language סליחה teaches that the sin has passed as if it never was a reality at all.
On the contrary, with the words <b>מעביר עון</b> (removes the iniquity) – it is still in a different place; and moreover <b>נושא עון</b> (pardons the iniquity) – God carries it; <b>תם עונך</b> (The punishment of your iniquity is accomplished)<sup class="footnote-marker">638</sup><i class="footnote">Lamentations 4:22.</i> – it was a reality in the past.
But העון הנסלח is as if the sin never existed at all.
And thus, the language סליחה is never found from man to man, because a man is not able to forgive a person in such a way, as if the sin never existed.

Klal 357

<b>הכפרה</b> (atonement) is associated with the sacrifice that is brought, but <b>הסליחה</b> (forgiveness) is associated with the one who forgives. Nevertheless, in a place where forgiveness comes in passive voice and afterwards comes the word לו or לכם - <b>ונסלח לו</b> – it will always be through an atonement and an expense that precedes it.<br><br><i>Leviticus 4:26 says, </i>ואת כל חלבו יקטיר המזבחה כחלב זבח השלמים וכפר עליו הכהן מחטאתו ונסלח לו<i> (And all the fat thereof shall he make smoke upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin, and he shall be forgiven). In this verse, the expense and atonement precedes the words </i>ונסלח לו<i> (and he shall be forgiven), in accordance with Rule 357<sup class="footnote-marker">639</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 277.</i>.</i>

Klal 358

Any place where it says <b>וכפר ונסלח</b> (make atonement and be forgiven) (and placement of blood is mentioned in the chapter, so there is no need to say <b>וכפר</b> with respect to the sprinkling of the blood) - then the verb וכפר will be superfluous, since סליחה belongs in the category of כפרה, and it will always come with a homiletical interpretation.
And the sages will interpret that it teaches that it atones even when one misses a certain detail in the sprinkling.
On the contrary, any place where it does not clarify that there is to be a placement of blood, the wordכפר with respect to the sprinkling of the blood will be necessary for the matter itself.

Klal 359

It is not the way of the Scripture to mention the name of the sacrifice which atones near the word כפר. And when it is written, וכפר באיל האשם (and the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt-offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">640</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 5:16.</i>, there is a homiletical interpretation.<br><br><i>Leviticus 5:16, which saysואת אשר חטא מן הקדש ישלם ואת חמישתו יוסף עליו ונתן אתו לכהן והכהן יכפר עליו באיל האשם ונסלח לו (And he shall make restitution for that which he has done amiss in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt-offering, and he shall be forgiven), mentions the name of the sacrifice which atones, the ram of the guilt-offering, near the word יכפר, thus breaking Rule 359. The homiletical interpretation of this is that if he does not bring the ram of the guilt-offering, he will not fulfill his obligation, as opposed to if it had only said the word יכפר, in which he could fulfill his obligation through bringing money instead of a ram<sup class="footnote-marker">641</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 357.</i>.</i>

Klal 360

<b>הרצון</b> (will) comes with two meanings: a) from the theme of appeasement like כי נרצה עונה (that her guilt is paid off)<sup class="footnote-marker">642</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 40:2.</i> b) from the theme of desire.
And there is a difference between <b>חפץ</b> (desire) and <b>רצון</b> (will): <b>חפץ</b> is through the tendency of the soul. On the contrary, רצון is from the free will of the mind and is clean from all tendencies of the soul. And one can conceive of a man who רצה a certain object but does not חפץ it, and vice versa.<br><br><i>רצון is an intellectual desire, while חפץ is an emotional or physical desire. For example, one can </i>רצה<i> to eat only kosher food for the reason that the Torah says to only eat kosher food, but one may still חפץ non-kosher food because he desires the taste.</i>

Klal 361

And thus, one is able to command with respect to one’s רצון (will) but not one’s חפץ (desire). And commanding or requesting with the verb חפץ is not found anywhere, only with the verb רצה.
Nevertheless, it is only possible to command a person with respect to his own רצון, not with respect to the רצון of others.
<b>נרצה</b> is never found in passive voice (on commanding one’s desire) with respect to the one who wills, only with respect to a matter that is willed.

Klal 362

And there is a difference between when the noun <b>רצון</b> (desire) comes alone or when the verb <b>רצה</b> (desire) comes alone, and when after <b>רצה</b> comes the word <b>לו</b> or <b>לכם</b>: any place where it says לא ירצה alone, the sacrifice is completely invalid. And any place where it saysלא ירצה לכם (it shall not be accepted for you) – it means that He wants the offering to fulfill the obligation of the owner, that they are desired and valid slaughters, but they are not offerings that fulfill the obligation of the owner. Or whenever it says, ונרצה לו (it shall be accepted for him), it means that the offering fulfills the obligation of the owner.
The language לא ירצה will only fall on animals consecrated for the altar, not on items consecrated for Temple maintenance.

Klal 363

<b>חטא עון פשע</b> (sin): The verb <b>חטא</b> is spoken with respect to the tendency from the way that is proper and it includes unintentional and intentional sins, anything that was not done due to atheism or heresy. And thus, it is necessary to say כי תחטא בשגגה (If any one shall sin through error)<sup class="footnote-marker">643</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:2.</i>, in order to indicate that the sin is unintentional.
But if the three nouns come in their precise meaning, and all the more so when they are mentioned together, it indicates with the noun <b>חטא</b> that it is an unintentional sin, with the noun <b>עון</b> a distortion of the mind so that it is an intentional sin, and with the noun <b>פשע</b> that he has a rebellious and abhorrent soul.
And according to this, <b>עון</b> is the opposite of unintentional sin, <b>פשע</b> is the opposite of unwilling sin, and <b>חטא</b> is the opposite of uncertainty that one sins.

Klal 364

The prefix <b>ל</b>, <b>ב</b>, or <b>מ</b> coming after the verb חטא (sin):
When the prefix <b>ל</b> comes after חטא, it indicates the entity that one sins against.
When the prefix <b>ב</b> comes after חטא, it indicates the manner in which one sins.
When the prefix <b>מ</b> comes after חטא, it indicates that sin is in part of the matter.
When the word <b>על</b> comes after חטא, it indicates the cause of the sin.

Klal 365

The verb <b>אשם</b> (guilt) indicates the punishment that comes as a result of the sin. And it sometimes comes on the punishment itself and sometimes comes on the sin in the sense that one recognizes that he is obligated a punishment.
And thus, it will only come on five things - robbery, illegal use of holy property, abuse of a betrothed maidservant, religious asceticism, and leprosy – as Nachmanides clarifies the reason for this. And when it uses the noun <b>אשם</b> for an adjustable guilt offering twice – this comes to imply that its law is like that of a guilt offering.

Klal 366

There is a difference between <b>שגה</b> (with a ה at the end) and <b>שגג</b> (with a repeating <b>ג</b>): שגה is a mistake in consideration, that he errs because of consideration or sense, etc. And שגג is an unintentional sin in deed. And this will be:
If through error in consideration, like eating prohibited fat that seems to him to be permissible to eat.
Or without consideration, for example when prohibited fat becomes confused for permissible fat.
<b>השגיאה</b> is attributed to the Sanhedrin, while <b>השגגה</b> is attributed to the masses.

Klal 367

The verb <b>שגה</b> (err) that comes before the prefix ב or מ:
If the action indicates that he did it by שגיאה (mistake) – the letter ב will come after it, likeלמה תשגה בני בזרה (Why then wilt you, my son, be ravished with a strange woman)<sup class="footnote-marker">644</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 5:20.</i>.
And if the action indicates that he did not do it by שגיאה – the letter מ will come after it, like סלית כל שוגים מחוקיך (You have made light of all them that err from Your statutes)<sup class="footnote-marker">645</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 119:118.</i>.

Klal 368

There is a difference between the language <b>בשגגה</b> (unintentionally) or <b>בבלי דעת</b> (without knowledge) and the language <b>ולא ידע</b> (and he does not know): An accidental sin in the time of his deed is indicated with the words בשגגה or בבלי דעת, but the words ולא ידע indicate that he does not know a deed that someone else had done or a deed that he had already done, or it indicates that he does not know how it will be done.

Klal 369

There is a difference between the language <b>שגיאה</b> (error) and the language <b>הפלאה</b> (wonder), and the language <b>העלמה</b> (hidden):
In a time of one seeking and investigating to know something but he is unable to know it, it will use the language <b>הפלאה</b>.
And in a time of one studying a matter and a false statement comes up in his perusal opposite of the truth, it will use the language <b>שגיאה</b>.
And on the hidden, in general it will use the language <b>העלמה</b>, that <b>העלמה</b> includes all that he does not know about a certain matter, for whatever reason.

Klal 370

And any place where it depends on it being hidden from the eyes (like <b>ונעלם מעיני</b> אשה - and it be hid from the eyes of her husband<sup class="footnote-marker">646</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 5:13.</i>), it is implied that there were eyes to see the matter.
And when it says about the rule ונעלם מעיני הקהל (the thing being hid from the eyes of the assembly)<sup class="footnote-marker">647</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:13.</i>, it hints to the <i>Sanhedrin</i>, that they are the eyes of the general public.

Klal 371

The language <b>הקרבה</b> (sacrifice) comes on the delivery (like והקריב את הכל) and it is from the theme of <b>קרב</b> (come close) that it is synonymous with <b>נגש</b> (approach). And it also comes on the spilling of blood. And the sages of blessed memory explain that it also refers to sacred property, from the theme of sacrifice.
And when it is written והקריבו הכהנים (and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall present the blood)<sup class="footnote-marker">648</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:5.</i>, it means receiving, from the theme of <i>close</i> and <i>within</i>.

Klal 372

We do not find the language הקרבה (sacrifice) used with respect to something that is not a sacrifice in and of itself but only comes to fix a sacrifice.
And when it is written תקריב מלח (you shall offer salt)<sup class="footnote-marker">649</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 2:13.</i>, it comes to teach that its law is like the law for sacrifices in that it takes precedence over the Sabbath and uncleanness.
It says וזאת תורת זבח השלמים אשר יקריב (And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace-offerings)<sup class="footnote-marker">650</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:11.</i>; although, it does not speak about the laws of a sacrifice at all. This is to teach that the law for the bread is like the law for sacrifices.

Klal 373

With respect to bringing a sacrifice, it will use the language <b>הקרבה</b> (offer a sacrifice), or <b>לקיחה</b> (take), or <b>הבאה</b> (bring), in that they made it holy and took it and brought it.
And whenever it indicates that he made a sacrifice by himself, it will use the language <b>עשיה</b> (offering). And moreover, whenever it speaks about all of the particulars of his offerings, it will use the language <b>עשיה</b>.
And whenever it uses the language <b>הבאה</b> with the sheaf offering and the language <b>עשיה</b> with a he-lamb that is with it, there will be a homiletical interpretation.

Klal 374

And there is a difference between whether the language עשיה (offering) comes on a living creature – that then it means he will sanctify it or present it – and when the language עשיה comes on the sacrifice like ועשה את החטאת(offer the sin-offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">651</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:19.</i>, that then it means he will do all of his actions and its details for the sake of the sin-offering.

Klal 375

Any place where it talks about bringing a sacrifice from his house, it will use the language <b>הבאה</b> and not the language <b>הקרבה</b>, unless it talks about the service of sacrifice that is in the Temple Court or bringing its blood and its limbs to the altar. And any place where the language הקרבה comes on the bringing of a sacrifice, there will be a homiletical interpretation.

Klal 376

We only find in the book of Torah the verb <b>העלאה</b> (raise) used to describe a burnt offering when it is done on a private altar or a new altar. But when it is done on an altar in the Holy Temple, it will use the language עשיה or הקרבה or הקטרה.
And when it is written והעלה את העולה (And the priest shall offer the burnt-offering and the meal-offering upon the altar)<sup class="footnote-marker">652</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:20.</i>, there is a homiletical interpretation.
And there is a difference between <b>נדר</b> (vow) and <b>נדבה</b> (donation), in that with a <b>נדר</b>, one says, “behold, it is upon me”, while with a <b>נדבה</b> one says, “behold, here it is”. And also a <b>נדבה</b> describes a sacrifice that comes through the giving of the heart. And both are used whether for sacrifices on the altar or for items consecrated for Temple maintenance.<br><br><i>Leviticus 14:20 says, והעלה את העולה (And the priest shall offer the burnt-offering and the meal-offering upon the altar), using the verb <b>העלאה</b> (raise) to describe a burnt offering done in the Holy Temple, which is against Rule 376. The homiletical interpretation for this is that this teaches that the sacrifice will still be valid even if it is not slaughtered for the sake of Heaven<sup class="footnote-marker">653</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Metzora 61.</i>.</i>

Klal 377

There is a difference between <b>שחט</b>, <b>טבח</b>, <b>זבח</b> (slaughter):
<b>טבח</b> and <b>זבח</b>indicate the status of a living creature after it is slaughtered; only <b>זבח</b> indicates that it is for a special need, for instance for the need of a celebratory event, invited guests, or a sacrifice. And <b>טבח</b> only indicates that it is prepared for food. And it is different from other nouns which teach about the death of living creature in that <b>טבח</b> is for the needs of the public, while <b>זבח</b> is for the needs of an individual.
And <b>שחט</b> indicates the quality of the slaughter through a known method, from the neck, etc., from the laws of <i>kosher</i> slaughter.

Klal 378

There is a difference between <b>זריקה , שפיכה , נתינה , הזיה</b> (that are mentioned with respect to placement of the blood of the sacrifices):
<b>זריקה</b> (sprinkle) and <b>שפיכה</b> (pour) are from a vessel, a lot at one time; <b>שפיכה</b> is from above to below in one place, while <b>זריקה</b> is to the side or from below to above.
<b>הזיה</b> (spray) and <b>נתינה</b> (giving) are by hand and a little. Only <b>הזיה</b> is at a distance, that from this it sprays by means of his hand or through a bunch of hyssop, while <b>נתינה</b> is with a finger unhurriedly.

Klal 379

<b>יציקה</b> is synonymous with <b>שפיכה</b> (pouring), only that <b>יציקה</b> teaches that he pours frugally to a unique center.

Klal 380

And there is <b>הזיה</b> (sprinkling) also from the body of a bird. And there is a difference between it and <b>מצה</b> (squeezing): <b>הזיה</b> grasps the body of the bird, goes up and down, and the blood sprays on its own, while <b>מצה</b> squeezes between his fingers.

Klal 381

After the verb <b>הזה</b> (sprinkle) always comes the prefix <a dir="rtl">מ</a> - והזה מן (sprinkle from), except when it is written והזה אותו על הכפורת (and sprinkle it upon the ark-cover)<sup class="footnote-marker">654</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:15.</i>, that indicates that he will only sprinkle above once: The מ indicates that the sprinkling gets divided drop by drop, while the wordאת indicates that the sprinkling is all at once.

Klal 382

And there is a difference between <b>מצץ</b>, <b>מצה</b>, <b>מיץ</b>:
<b>מצץ</b> (suck) sucks in one’s mouth matter that has moisture in it.
<b>מיץ</b> (juice) is the squeezing of a beverage that is absorbed in a certain substance.
<b>מצה</b> (squeeze) teaches about the extract that is solidified at the brim of a vessel.

Klal 383

The verb <b>חִטֵא</b> (offer it for sin) in intensive conjugation teaches that one removes the sin and the disadvantage, and it comes with respect to dashing of the blood. And moreover, it refers to sprinkling of the ash of a cow in that it removes the disadvantage of the uncleanness.
And any place where the verb חטא is found with a pronoun, the pronoun will refer to the object that accepts the sprinkling and the cleanness. And moreover, it means “clean oneself” when it is in reflexive conjugation.
But in three places, the pronoun refers to the sin offering itself, and they interpret it to mean that it is made with the blood, as is from the law of sin offerings.
And we find that the sages of blessed memory explain that when it is written וכל חטאת אשר יובא מדמה (And no sin-offering, whereof any of the blood is brought)<sup class="footnote-marker">655</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:23.</i> and moreoverמדם חטאת הכפורים (with the blood of the sin-offering of atonement)<sup class="footnote-marker">656</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 30:10.</i> that חטאת is a noun derived from the verb חטא in intensive conjugation, and it means <i>sprinkled blood</i>.<br><br><i>Three places in the Torah, the pronoun that comes with the verb </i>חטא<i> refers to the sin offering itself<sup class="footnote-marker">657</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Tzav 59.</i>:</i><br><br><i>Leviticus 6:19 says, </i>הכהן המחטא אתה יאכלנה במקום קדש תאכל בחצר אהל מועד<i> (The priest that offers it for sin shall eat it; in a holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting), using המחטא אותה for “that offers it for sin”.</i><br><br><i>Leviticus 9:15 says, </i>ויקרב את קרבן העם ויקח את שעיר החטאת אשר לעם וישחטהו ויחטאהו כראשון<i> (And the people's offering was presented; and he took the goat of the sin-offering which was for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first), using </i>ויחטאהו<i> for “and offered it for sin”.</i><br><br><i>2 Chronicles 29:24 says,</i>וישחטום הכהנים ויחטאו את דמם המזבחה לכפר על כל ישראל כי לכל ישראל אמר המלך העולה והחטאת<i> (and the priests killed them, and they made a sin-offering with their blood upon the altar, to make atonement for all Israel; for the king commanded that the burnt-offering and the sin-offering should be made for all Israel), using ויחטאו for “and they made a sin-offering”.</i>

Klal 384

<b>המשליך</b> (throw/cast) is from a distance. (Also associated with this verb is the concept of despair and leaving.) If it is placed quietly on the ground, it will say <b>מניח</b> or <b>משים</b> or <b>נותן</b>.
And when <i>Tosafot<sup class="footnote-marker">658</sup><i class="footnote">Babylonian Talmud Meilah 11b.</i></i> says that ordinary השלכה (throwing/casting) means at least twenty <i>amos</i>, it is only talking about when the priest casts away the crop of a bird with its feathers<sup class="footnote-marker">659</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 1:16.</i>.

Klal 385

The verb <b>יצק על</b> (pour upon) teaches that he pours upon the whole. But the verb <b>נתן על</b> (put thereon) will sometimes mean upon part of it<sup class="footnote-marker">660</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 2:1.</i>.

Klal 386

There is a difference between <b>ונתן</b> and <b>וישם</b> (put/place); נתינה requires some minimum amount to be placed.
Furthermore, there is a difference between them in that the verb נתינה focuses on the placement with it and is borrowed from the language נתינה (giving) that is restricted to the opposite of the language לקיחה (taking) to mean anything which is given in a certain place that one rests there. But the verb שימה focuses on the quality of the placement, if there was a certain order and arrangement or a connection with the place, or with respect to the object that is placed - that one was careful in its placement.

Klal 387

When preparing an obstacle before one’s friend without the friend’s knowledge, it will use the verb <b>שימה</b> (place), and when preparing an obstacle before someone through bad advice, it will use the verb <b>נתינה</b>.

Klal 388

All gifts of the priesthood that are inside the Holy Temple are gifts ascribed to God or to a priest, while gifts within the limits are ascribed to the owners.<br><br><i>Deuteronomy 18:3-4 says,</i>וזה יהיה משפט הכהנים מאת העם מאת זבחי הזבח אם שור אם שה ונתן לכהן הזרע והלחיים והקבה. ראשית דגנך תירשך ויצהרך וראשית גז צאנך תתן לו<i> (And this shall be the priests' due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw. The first-fruits of your corn, of your wine, and of your oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep, shall you give him), ascribing the gifts to the owners.</i>

Klal 389

And there is a difference between <b>חלקם</b> (their portion)<sup class="footnote-marker">661</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:10.</i> and <b>נתתי לכם</b> (I have given to you): החלק means all that is a portion for him, even if it never touches his hand. And when it is written נתתי אותה (I have given it)<sup class="footnote-marker">662</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>, it means that it has arrived into the hand of the one who merits it.

Klal 390

On matters which come from decrees of God, it will not use the language נתינה (give), unless they are for good or for a good purpose. And if the languageנתינה is associated with matters that are evil, the intention will be for informing of the fulfillment of some promise. And it attributesנתינה to God in matters that He arranges within Nature.<br><br><i>Leviticus 26:31 says, ונתתי את עריכם חרבה והשמותי את מקדשיכם ולא אריח בריח ניחחכם (And I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours), using the language נתינה to inform of the fulfillment of a promise.</i><br><br><i>Leviticus 26:3-4 says,אם בחקתי תלכו ואת מצותי תשמרו ועשיתם אתם. ונתתי גשמיכם בעתם ונתנה הארץ יבולה ועץ השדה יתן פריו (If you walk in My statutes, and keep My commandments, and do them; then I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield her produce, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit). This is an example of attributingנתינה to God in matters that He arranges within Nature.</i>

Klal 391

And there is a difference between the language <b>נתינה</b> (giving) when the prefix ל of acquisition comes after it – it teaches that one transfers or gives an object to his friend to be his or to be in his possession - and when the prefix ל does not come after it and all the more so when it comes in a sentence in which the predicate is negated - it will be from the theme of abandonment.

Klal 392

The language <b>לקיחה</b> (taking) will come according to its context. Usually, it will be without an intermediary. And with respect to things that are taken in the hand, there is a disagreement as to whether <b>לקיחה</b> can refer to taking them through some other means.
And <b>לקיחה</b> that is said about a human is when one’s heart is pulled through good words.

Klal 393

לקיחה (taking) for which the prefix letter מ comes afterwards indicates the place that one takes from or the portion that one takes from the whole.
And if he takes the whole thing, the word את will come afterwards.

Klal 394

Taking from one’s friend comes in two ways – taking possession and taking from one giving willingly. And with both ways, there is a difference between whether <b>ממנו</b> or מ comes afterwards or the word <b>מאתו</b> comes afterwards:
The language of taking with possession is indicated with the word <b>מאתו</b>, that he takes an object that is in the domain of his friend, and the language of taking from his friend giving willingly is indicated with the word <b>מאתו</b>, that he gives it to him with good will. And the word מאתו does not come if it is taken without the will of the owner.
And the language <b>הנחה</b> (placing) is used sometimes with complete abandonment and sometimes with incomplete abandonment.

Klal 395

The verb <b>נתח</b> (cut) comes on the division that is made of an animal with a special order; if it is a division of its big limbs when it is butchered, or a division of the limbs from big to small when it is cooked.

Klal 396

The verb <b>ערך</b> (prepare) is the arrangement that is made for a certain matter with a special focus on a certain specific purpose. Like עריכת מלחמה (preparing for a war) and ערך השולחן (setting the table).

Klal 397

With respect to meal-offerings of fine flour, meal-offerings of a sinner, and <i>Sotah</i> (a woman accused of adultery), it writes <b>וקמץ</b> (grasp)<sup class="footnote-marker">663</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 2:2.</i>, because he grasps a handful, and it is written about them <b>מלוא קומצו</b> (his handful)<sup class="footnote-marker">664</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>. But with respect to a meal-offering of a stewing-pan and in Leviticus 6:8, it is written <b>והרים בקומצו</b> (And he shall take up therefrom his handful), since a baked meal-offering did not involve a handful but was only taken up with three of his fingers.

Klal 398

There is a difference between the noun <b>זכר</b> (remembrance) and the nouns <b>אזכרתה</b> and <b>זכרון</b> (memorial) which may commemorate anything, good or bad.
<b>אזכרתה</b> (memorial-part)<sup class="footnote-marker">665</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i> that is with respect to a meal-offering includes the frankincense as well as the meal-offering.

Klal 399

There is a difference between <b>נוצה</b> (plume), <b>כנף</b> (wing), and <b>אבר</b> (limb).
The <b>נוצה</b> includes the feathers that are on all of the body.
The <b>כנף</b> and <b>אבר</b> refer to the limb that makes flight possible; the above joint which is connected to the feathers is called an אבר, and the feathers combined with it is called a כנף.

Klal 400

There is a difference between <b>היקף</b> and <b>סביב</b> (surround): The verb <b>היקף</b> refers specifically to a complete surrounding, but the verb <b>סביב</b> also refers to an incomplete surrounding. If it wants to indicate that it will be a complete surrounding, the word will be repeated - <b>סביב סביב</b>, or it will use it as a verb, like וסבותם את העיר הקף (And you shall compass the city, all the men of war, going about the city once)<sup class="footnote-marker">666</sup><i class="footnote">Joshua 6:3.</i>.
And the word סביב is correct if it will be surrounding with four sacrifices or with two dashings of blood from a vessel on two diagonally opposite corners of the altar.

Klal 401

The verbs <b>דלק , בער , יצת</b> (ignite/burn) indicate the quality of lighting and burning while kindling a light and igniting it or strengthening a fire with wood. And several languages come with respect to this.
But the verb <b>שרף</b> (burn) indicates the burning of the object itself and also comes on objects having no light clinging to them and are only burned via wood and the like.
And there is a particular difference between <b>שרף</b> (burn) and <b>אכל</b> (consume): The verb <b>אכל</b> indicates the action of the fire itself when it consumes and destroys the physical matter, while the verb <b>שרף</b> indicates the action of the person who causes the burning of the wood.

Klal 402

And the verb <b>שרף</b> (burn) includes all melting of matter and grinding. Like משרפות מים (burning water) or משרפות סיד (burning lime). And moreover, the burning of a body that dies through the hand of Heaven. And thus, it says ישרף באש (burn with fire)<sup class="footnote-marker">667</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:12.</i>.

Klal 403

The verb <b>יקד</b> (burn) indicates a great bonfire. And when it is written תוקד לא תכבה (shall be kept burning thereby, it shall not go out)<sup class="footnote-marker">668</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:5.</i> – the words לא תכבה are superfluous, since this is known from the verb תוקד – and the words are there in order to teach that it is a negative commandment.
And there is a difference between the verb <b>דלק</b> (light) and the verb <b>העלה</b> (bring to light): The verb העלה indicates the flame going up, while דלק indicates the beginning of the lighting.

Klal 404

The verb <b>אפה</b> (bake) and the noun <b>מאפה</b> (pastry) include all types of baking, even that which is baked in a frying pan or in a deep fryer, unless it addsאשר תאפה בתנור (that is baked in the oven).

Klal 405

The noun <b>תנור</b> (oven) in its precise meaning refers to a clay vessel that is made into a certain form in which a light is lit and it bakes in it the bread. And in its broad meaning, it also includes a stove or anything similar to it which strengthens the light inside of it.

Klal 406

There is a difference between <b>תנור</b> (oven) and <b>כירים</b> (stove): <b>כירים</b> only cooks what is resting on the fire and in the pot that is placed upon it for cooking. And it is called כיר from the language of fire. And the name for pairs <b>כירים</b> is used when there is space for two pots resting. And the name <b>כירים</b> is not used before the heating. But the noun <b>תנור</b> can also be used before the heating.
And moreover, the name <b>כלי חרש</b> (earthenware vessel) cannot be used until it is heated with a light through its creator. And thus, it is also called <b>כלי יוצר</b> (pottery) and before this it is called חומר (material) or טיט (mortar).

Klal 407

There is a difference between the noun <b>לחם</b> and the noun <b>חלה</b> (bread): The noun <b>לחם</b> includes anything that is food for a human, while the noun <b>חלה</b> specifies the form of the bread and its round shape; the root <b>חל</b> teaches about the roundness. And any place where it is written<b>חלת לחם</b> , it means round bread.
And there is another difference, in that the noun חלה can also be before it is baked but after it is made with its round shape.
And when it is written על חלת לחם חמץ (with cakes of leavened bread)<sup class="footnote-marker">669</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:13.</i>, it is impossible to interpret it to mean <i>לחם חלה</i> (round bread), since the noun חלה precedes חמץ. With this, we are forced to conclude that the noun לחם modifies the noun חלה, and it means to say that it needs the חלה to be לחם, meaning baked in an oven.

Klal 408

When the noun לחם (bread) comes with respect to a sacrifice, in its precise meaning it refers to a routine sacrifice, like that which comes with respect to a routine feast. And in its broad meaning, it also refers to a feast and a sacrifice that is occasional.

Klal 409

Ordinary <b>לחם</b> (bread) in its precise meaning is made of wheat, while <b>קלוי</b> (toast) can also be from barley. And when it says <b>לחם וקלוי</b>, it is known that also the noun <b>לחם</b> comes in its broad meaning and even includes bread made of barley.

Klal 410

The noun לחם (bread) does not come in plural, but its adjectives come in plural.
And the noun לחם sometimes comes in masculine and sometimes comes in feminine. And when it is written והיתה ללחם לאזכרה ואכלוהו (that it may be to the bread for a memorial-part …. and they shall eat it)<sup class="footnote-marker">670</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 24:7-9.</i>, the pronoun והיתה refers to the gift-offering, since the noun לחם comes in masculine.<br><br><i>Leviticus 24:7-9 says,ונתת על המערכת לבנה זכה והיתה ללחם לאזכרה אשה ליהוה. ביום השבת ביום השבת יערכנו לפני יהוה תמיד מאת בני ישראל ברית עולם. והיתה לאהרן ולבניו ואכלהו במקום קדש כי קדש קדשים הוא לו מאשי יהוה חק עולם (And you shall put pure frankincense with each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial-part, even an offering made by fire to the LORD. Every sabbath day he shall set it in order before the LORD continually; it is from the children of Israel, an everlasting covenant. And it shall be for Aaron and his sons; and they shall eat it in a holy place; for it is most holy to him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, a perpetual due).</i><br><br><i>The verb ואכלוהו in the last verse means “and they shall eat it”, where “it” comes in masculine; thus, “it” must refer to </i>לחם<i>. And the pronoun והיתה in the first verse, which means “that it may be”, comes in feminine; thus, “it”must refer to the gift-offering<sup class="footnote-marker">671</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Emor 232.</i>.</i>

Klal 411

There is a difference between <b>פת</b> and <b>לחם</b> (bread): <b>לחם</b> is whole and is called by several particular names, according to its form - <b>ככר לחם</b> (loaf of bread), <b>חלה</b> (bread used on Sabbath and festivals), <b>רקיק</b> (biscuit), <b>מצה</b> (unleavened bread). But <b>פת</b> is not whole.

Klal 412

There is a difference between <b>פתת</b> and <b>פרס</b> (break): <b>פרס</b> is broken from the bread and is not connected to it. <b>פתת</b> is when it changes its form through folding into two, even when the parts are connected.

Klal 413

There is a difference between <b>פתת ופרס</b> and <b>פרר</b> (crumble), in that <b>פרר</b> is crumbled into little pieces smaller than olives.

Klal 414

There is a difference between <b>חמץ</b> and <b>שאור</b> (leaven): <b>שאור</b> leavens the dough, and the dough that is leavened from it is called <b>חמץ</b>.
And there is a difference between <b>חמץ</b> and <b>חומץ</b>: <b>חומץ</b> includes things like חומץ יין ובוסר (vinegar, wine, unripe fruits), but the noun <b>חמץ</b> and מחמצת refer only to the dough that is leavened.

Klal 415

<b>קליות - נקודים</b> (scorched).
According to Rabbi Meir, both are in fire, only קליות is with a little flicker, while נקודים is with a great bonfire.
And according to the sages, קליות is scorched in a vessel that is called a קלל and is called קליות after the vessel. And it is written קלוי באש (parched with fire)<sup class="footnote-marker">672</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 2:14.</i>, because it was the perforated vessel.

Klal 416

There is a difference between the verb <b>קרא</b> (call) that precedes the letter <b>ל</b> – then the one who is called is far away from the caller – and the verb <b>קרא</b> that precedes the word <b>אל</b> – then the one who is called is before the caller and the caller invites him to hear speech.

Klal 417

<b>קריאה</b> (exclamation) - its main theme is that it is done in close proximity. And in a place that is remote, it will be a calling of a name like סורו טמא קראו למו (‘Depart! Unclean!’ men cried to them, 'Depart, depart, touch not'; yea, they fled away and wandered; men said among the nations: 'They shall no more sojourn here')<sup class="footnote-marker">673</sup><i class="footnote">Lamentations 4:15.</i>, or from the theme of announcement.

Klal 418

And there is a distinction with respect to proclaiming/calling something, in that when קרא (proclaim/call) pertains to proclaiming something where afterwards the word את comes – it indicates that the proclaiming is primary. And when afterwards the prefix ל comes – it indicates that the calling is secondary to the actual name that the entity is called, which is primary.<br><br><i>Leviticus 23:4 says, אלה מועדי יהוה מקראי קדש אשר תקראו אתם במועדם (These are the appointed seasons of the LORD, even holy convocations, which you shall proclaim in their appointed season). By Rule 418, since אתם comes after תקראו, the proclaiming of the appointed seasons is primary.</i><br><br><i>Genesis 1:5 says, ויקרא אלהים לאור יום ולחשך קרא לילה (And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night). By Rule 418, since the prefix ל comes after the verb ויקרא, the calling is secondary to the actual name that light and darkness are called, Day and Night, which are primary<sup class="footnote-marker">674</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Emor 141.</i>.</i>

Klal 419

The concept of <b>ההודאה</b> (admission) is the opposite of heresy and is a matter which one publicizes orally and is the nature of a man to evade.
And this or one admits praise of his friend.
Or he admits praises of God (since it is the way of man to depend on nature for everything).
Or admit disgrace upon himself; and from this, it is a type of confession of sins.

Klal 420

There is a difference between <b>מכחיש</b> (deny the truth) and <b>מכחד</b> (conceal the truth):
<b>מכחד</b> conceals a matter from one’s friend and is usually carried out by not doing or saying anything. And it is linked with the matter itself and is always found with respect to hidden matters.
But <b>מכחיש</b> will say something that is opposite of the truth.

Klal 421

And there is a difference between <b>כחש</b> (lie/falsehood) when it comes with the prefix ב afterwards and when it comes with the prefix ל afterwards:
<b>המחכש בחברו</b> tells to his friend in his face a matter which his friend claims against him, and he says the opposite.
<b>והמכחש לחברו</b> says a falsehood that his friend does not contradict.
Thus, when an Israelite <b>כחש</b> (lies) against God, it comes with the prefix ב afterwards, because His signs and wonders answer the falsehood in their faces; and to a Gentile, it comes with the prefix ל afterwards.
<b>כחש</b> (falsehood) and <b>כחד</b> (concealing the whole truth) that do not have any prefix after them are distinguished in that <b>כחד</b> is with a matter that is not known, while <b>כחש</b> is with a matter that is known.

Klal 422

And there is a difference between <b>כחש</b> and <b>שקר</b> (falsehood), in that <b>שקר</b> is used also in a matter where it is impossible to know that it is false.

Klal 423

And there is a difference between <b>נשבע לשקר</b> and <b>נשבע על שקר</b> (false oath): שבועת שקר (false oath) always comes with the prefix ל, except when the word על comes after it; then it means <i>for the sake of</i>, to indicate that the matter was sworn for the sake of falsehood.

Klal 424

There is a difference between <b>עד</b> and <b>עונה</b> (witness): One is called an <b>עונה</b> from the perspective that he gives testimony in court, and it comes before the prefix ב. And one is called an <b>עד</b> from the perspective that he is designated and is valid as a witness and from the perspective that he warned the accused. And it only means that he is valid as a witness, and he is called an <b>עד</b> even if he does not give testimony before the court.

Klal 425

There is a difference between <b>מעל</b> and <b>בגד</b> (fraud): <b>בגד</b> is when one lies to his friend in private, while <b>מעל</b> is when one lies in public. And they are analogous with the words מעיל (coat) and בגד (garment), as a בגד is worn on the inside while a מעיל is worn on the outside.

Klal 426

There is a difference between <b>לא תשיג</b> and <b>לא תגיע ידו</b> (his means suffice not), just as there is a difference between השגה and הגעה: <b>השגה</b> (obtain/achieve) is an action done in the act of acting and is associated with the word את which obtains the matter. And <b>ההגעה</b> (arrive) is actually the action and is associated with the word אל which comes to the matter. And thus, it always uses the language השגה to talk about lack of attainment. And when it uses the language הגעה, it is saying that he reaches the matter but nevertheless still does not have it, since he is poor and needs to sell it.
And with respect to a woman giving birth, it uses <b>לא תמצא ידה</b> (And if her means suffice not)<sup class="footnote-marker">675</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 12:8.</i>, since her husband brings the sacrifice for her and she neither משגת nor מגעת, but only מוצאת (finds) through her husband.

Klal 427

The noun <b>מד</b> (garment) is distinguished from <b>בגד שמלה</b> (garment) in what it teaches about the garment, that <b>מד</b> means that it is intended to fit.
And the noun <b>בגד</b> always comes in masculine. And when it is written על הבגד אשר יזה עליה (upon any garment, you shall wash that whereon it was sprinkled in a holy place)<sup class="footnote-marker">676</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 6:20.</i>, it comes to teach that it does not come in its precise meaning, only its broad meaning, which includes all clothes, even clothes that are not made of wool or linen.<br><br><i>Leviticus 6:20 says, </i>כל אשר יגע בבשרה יקדש ואשר יזה מדמה על הבגד אשר יזה עליה תכבס במקום קדש<i> (Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy; and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, you shall wash that whereon it was sprinkled in a holy place), using feminine language, </i>אשר יזה עליה<i> (whereon it was sprinkled). According to the Malbim, this implies that the masculine noun </i><b>בגד</b><i> comes in its broad meaning<sup class="footnote-marker">677</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Tzav 65.</i>.</i>

Klal 428

There is a difference between <b>דשן</b> (fertilizer) and <b>אפר</b> (ash):
The noun <b>דשן</b> refers in the Scripture only to oily substances that are burned, where the fire removes the fertilizer and the fat. (And there is a difference between <b>דשן</b> (fertilizer) and <b>שמן</b> (oil): <b>דשן</b> teaches about the natural moisture of the roots of living things, while the <b>דשן</b> of the altar is slippery and is given this moisture through the fire.)
But the name <b>אפר</b> includes all that is burned. And when it refers to fertilizer that is burned, it is called <b>דשן</b> as soon as the fire dominates it. But with the noun <b>אפר</b>, it is not called this until it is made as dust.

Klal 429

<b>היציאה</b> (exit) is always beyond a barrier, or in one way or another a logical barrier, or that which exits from one’s body to outside.
And when it says <b>ויצא אל</b> פתח הבית (go out to the door of the house)<sup class="footnote-marker">678</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:38.</i>, it means under the doorpost. But when it says <b>ויצא מן</b> הבית (go out of the house)<sup class="footnote-marker">679</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>, it means that he exited completely.

Klal 430

Partial <b>ביאה</b> (put) is not called ביאה. And moreover, when it is written במים יובא (it must be put into water)<sup class="footnote-marker">680</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 11:32.</i>, it teaches that it means all at one time, not portion after portion.

Klal 431

<b>יציאה וביאה</b> (going and coming) and moreover <b>הוצאה והובאה</b> will be from the point of view of the speaker. And when it focuses on movement from the speaker – it will use the language יציאה. And when it focuses on what goes towards the speaker, it will use the language ביאה. Until then, in one domain it may sometimes use יציאה and sometimes use ביאה.

Klal 432

The language <b>שיבה</b> (return) teaches that someone or something returns to the place or to the theme in which he/she/it was at first. And there is in this a point of view with respect to the language and intention of the speaker.

Klal 433

The verb <b>ישב</b> (continue) is taken from the topic of ישיבה (dwelling) to talk about anything that is placed in one state and lingers there.

Klal 434

And there is a difference between <b>קרב</b> and <b>נגש</b> (approach): <b>קרב</b> is when the two are equal, while <b>נגש</b> is when the small is before the great and in any place where there is trouble or fear.
<b>מקריב</b> and <b>מגיש</b> regarding a sacrifice are distinguished in that מקריב teaches about a routine sacrifice, whileמגיש teaches about a nonroutine sacrifice.

Klal 435

There is a difference between <b>עמד</b> and <b>ניצב</b> (stand): <b>עמד</b> is only the opposite of sitting, while<b>ניצב</b> teaches that one strengthens oneself by standing in that place.

Klal 436

There is <b>הליכה</b> (walking) in activity, and there is ethical or logical הליכה. And logical, ethical, and poetic הליכה will usually be in intensive conjugation –<b>אהלך</b> (I may walk in Your truth)<sup class="footnote-marker">681</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 86:11.</i>. And if it comes in simple conjugation with respect toהליכת הנפש (walking of the soul) -he wants to walk in this way regularly.
And the language <b>מתהלך</b> (wandering) in reflexive conjugation means walking here and there in order to hike or to wander before or by another subject.

Klal 437

<b>פנה</b> (face) means that one sets his face to a certain matter. And sometimes it will be to do a deed and sometimes it will only be to watch.
And with respect to God – when He sets His face for good, the word <b>אל</b> (towards) is used - ופניתי אליכם (and I will have respect to you)<sup class="footnote-marker">682</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 26:9.</i>; and for evil, the prefix <b>ב</b> is used - ונתתי פני בכם (And I will set My face against you)<sup class="footnote-marker">683</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 26:17.</i>.

Klal 438

The verb <b>פנה</b> (to empty/clear/cast out) in intensive conjugation indicates the moving of someone or something which has the potential to do damage to some other place.
And there is a difference between <b>מפנה</b> and <b>מבער</b>, in that <b>מפנה</b> expels to another side, while <b>מבער</b> removes from the world.

Klal 439

There is a difference between <b>שלח</b> (send) in simple conjugation and <b>שילח</b> (send away) in intensive conjugation, in that any sending away with the purpose of returning comes in simple conjugation, while any sending away without coming back comes in intensive conjugation, as with a funeral or a divorce. And any <b>שילח</b> in intensive conjugation in which the place to which it is sent is not mentioned will be immediate as the object goes out from its domain.

Klal 440

There is a difference between <b>פרש ידיו</b> and <b>נשא כפיו</b> (raising/spreading out his hands): <b>פרש ידיו</b> is for prayer, while <b>נשא כפיו</b> is for the priestly blessing.

Klal 441

There is a difference between <b>נזר</b> and <b>נסג</b> (abstinence) in that the <b>נזר</b> abstains from the matter because of asceticism and holiness, whether in reality or whether through one’s imagination.

Klal 442

The verb <b>דמם</b> (silence) is distinguished from <b>מחריש שותק</b> (silence) in that <b>דמם</b> teaches that it is an interruption from speech.

Klal 443

There are two types of <b>כיבוס</b> (washing):
1) Remove the stain; And this is done through scrubbing thoroughly in the place of the stain.
2) In a place where there is no stain, in which one must do ritual immersion in order to become spiritually clean.
And the verb <b>כבס</b> and moreover the verb <b>רחץ</b> (wash) always come in the Scripture with respect to the object which removes the stain and not with respect to the stain that is removed. However, in the chapter about afflictions, it sometimes refers to the washing of the affliction and it sometimes refers to the washing of the garment. And they are:
1) In places where the affliction does not depart through washing – the washing is ascribed to the affliction as it is not able to be ascribed to the garment, since the garment is not washed, not through the instruction to remove the stain (since the affliction does not depart) and not through the instruction which comes with water (since it does not wash all of the garment). And with this, the verb <b>הֻכַבֵס</b> always comes composed of simple and reflexive conjugation, since it is not really washed.
2) But in places where the affliction departs, the washing is ascribed to the garment.

Klal 444

Any place where it says <b>רחץ במים</b> (bathe in water), it means in the water of a ritual bath.
And when it says <b>ירחצו מים</b> (without the prefix letter <b>ב</b>) – it means the water of a sink, except when it is written ורחץ במים (And he shall bathe his flesh in water)<sup class="footnote-marker">684</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 16:24.</i>, in which case it alludes to the water of a sink, for a reason that is clarified there.

Klal 445

The verb <b>מרק</b> (polish) is used when talking about scrubbing and shining.
And it is different from <b>מרט</b> (polish), as <b>מרט</b> polishes from a body of iron. And <b>מרק</b> is the removal of the rust that is on its face, and it is enough in cold water.
And it is different from <b>שוטף</b> (wash), as <b>שוטף</b> is the removal of the water from the outside, while <b>מרק</b> is from within.
And sometimes <b>מרק</b> is with heat.

Klal 446

There is a difference between <b>קריעה</b> (tearing) and <b>פרימה</b> (unraveling): קריעה includes any place and any manner in which one tears, while פרימה is a tearing of the edge, that one tears the fringe.
And nevertheless, in a place where the direct object or the wordאותו (it) is mentioned (like <b>ויקרע את</b> בגדיו - and he tore his clothes, <b>וקרע אותו</b> - and he tore it), it is a complete tearing.
And there is a distinction between nouns that come with tearing and uprooting, whether they come alone (then its intended meaning is tearing and uprooting the object) or whether the prefix מ comes afterwards - וקרע מן (and tore from) – then it means that one tears and uproots the object from something that is attached to it.

Klal 447

And moreover, there is a difference between when the verb <b>סר</b> (depart) comes alone – that sometimes it will mean depart from this side to this side – and when it says <b>וסר מן</b> (depart from) - that it means to say that it departs completely.
And the verb <b>מסיר</b> (remove) is only correct with respect to two separate things that are only stuck together as neighbors, not if one object is split into two parts – that then it will use verbs <b>כורת ,חותך</b> etc.

Klal 448

There is a distinction in the language <b>שבירה נפוץ נתץ הרס</b> (to break):
The verb <b>שבר</b> is only correct in a matter of detachment, that it breaks into two, or with an instrument that is broken until it is no longer functional. And moreover, with an object that is composed of one material.
And if a vessel breaks into small pieces, it will use the language <b>נפוץ, הדק, כתית</b>.
But <b>נתץ והרס</b> are only used with respect to an object that is connected together through building. ההורס only damages the shape of the structure, while הנותץ also damages its material. And נותץ also depicts the parts that are smashed and left resting in their places, but ההורס depicts the parts moving from their places.

Klal 449

There is a difference between the verb <b>כלה</b> (finish/complete) when it is connected with a noun and when it is connected with a verb: When it is connected with a noun, it teaches that one is completely finished. And when it is connected with a verb, it teaches that one is finished performing the action, although the matter is not necessarily finished, like כאשר כלו להרוג (when Israel had made an end of slaying)<sup class="footnote-marker">685</sup><i class="footnote">Joshua 8:24.</i> – it does not indicate that all of the people were slayed, only that the action which caused them to be slayed was completed.
And when it is connected with a verb, it is usually connected with the letter ל, and sometimes is connected with the letter מ. And there is a difference between them: When it is connected with the letter ל, it indicates that the subject was immediate in finishing (or the action was immediately finished when the word את comes afterwards), and when it is connected with the letter מ, it only indicates that the subject was immediate in finishing at the time when he was able to finish and that he finished with the intention of stopping from whatever he was doing.

Klal 450

Several times, the verb <b>כלה</b> (finish/complete) comes on the completion of an action. And when it is written לא תכלה פאת שדך (you shall not wholly reap the corner of your field)<sup class="footnote-marker">686</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 19:9.</i>, it comes to teach about a portion from a portion, that it is enough to leave any amount in the corner.<br><br><i>If it had said לא תכלה שדך (you shall not wholly reap your field), it would mean that one has to leave a portion of the field for the poor and for the stranger. The word פאת teaches that one is not allowed to wholly reap the corner of his field, that one must leave a portion from the corner of his field, a portion from a portion<sup class="footnote-marker">687</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Kedoshim 15.</i>.</i>

Klal 451

There is a difference between <b>חלב</b> and <b>שומן</b> (fat): <b>חלב</b> is distinguished from meat, both in its nature and in its matter. And they will not get mixed together, since חלבis spread out loosely and has a membrane that can easily be peeled. And it will cluster on the sides as well. And the Torah explicitly restricts it from being sacrificed and being eaten.
And as a borrowed word, it will also call the fat of the tail fat of a sheep <b>חלב</b>, in that it is the <i>best</i>. And any place where the noun <b>חלב</b> comes where it means it is the best, it will come with a pronoun or in construct state. And the tail fat is called <b>חלב</b> for the purpose of a homiletical interpretation. Thus, with types of sin offerings, it is written כחלב זבח השלמים (as the fat of the sacrifice of peace-offerings)<sup class="footnote-marker">688</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 4:26.</i>.

Klal 452

In any matter in which milk is considered to have the same status as flesh, as with unclean animals, whenever the milk is combined with the flesh, it is included on its behalf - except with clean animals, in which the Scripture treats them separately.
And there is a disagreement as to whether נבלה (carcass) belongs in the category of חלב(animal fat).<br><br><i>According to Rule 452, unforbidden quantities of unclean animals may be combined with one another to form a forbidden quantity, for instance milk from a camel and meat from a rabbit. This is not necessarily true for clean animals.</i>

Klal 453

There are different ways to use the noun <b>דם</b> (blood): If it comes in construct state or with a pronoun referring to the living (like דם האדם, דם נקי, דמך על ראשך) then it means the blood that the life depends upon. But when it says <b>דם</b> alone, it means all blood that will be and even blood that is extracted and blood of the skin and the flesh.

Klal 454

The noun <b>שרץ</b> (swarming thing) refers to the movement, and the inferior living creatures which are called by this name are only distinguished from plants through their movement.
However, the verb <b>שוֹרֵץ</b> (swarm) refers to excessive procreation, and thus it addsהשרץ השורץ על הארץ (swarming thing that swarms upon the earth)<sup class="footnote-marker">689</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 11:41-42.</i> – it means to say that it fertilizes and increases there. On the contrary, when it is written השרץ הרומש על הארץ (swarming thing that moves upon the earth)<sup class="footnote-marker">690</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 11:44.</i>, it means even if it does not fertilize and increase.

Klal 455

The noun <b>נבלה</b> (carcass) refers to the obscene and the repulsive, and does not mean the bones and the hard parts which are not disgusting.
And it also refers to one limb that falls off of a living creature. And precisely, if it is similar to death of a living creature, for example a limb which is not replaceable or the flesh of tendons and bones. And moreover, מיתה (death) is correct when referring to one limb.

Klal 456

There is a difference between <b>הבהמה הנאכלת</b> and <b>הבהמה אשר היא לאכלה</b> (beast of which you may eat): The language הבהמה הנאכלת addresses whether it is permitted or prohibited, while the language אשר היא לאכלה means an animal that was prepared for eating, not only that it is permitted.
And there is a difference between <b>עוף טהור</b> (clean fowl) and <b>עוף אשר יאכל</b> (fowl which may be eaten), that אשר יאכל adds that it cannot have torn flesh, etc.<br><br><i>In order for meat to be kosher, it is not enough that the animal that was slaughtered was a kosher animal. The animal had to be slaughtered and prepared for eating according to the laws of kashrut. The distinction of the language that is discussed in this rule addresses this issue.</i>

Klal 457

There is a difference between <b>אכילה</b> (eating) and <b>טעימה</b> (tasting) in that אכילה is never used when the volume of that which is eaten is less than the volume of an olive.

Klal 458

And there is a disagreement as to whether אכילה (eating) belongs in the category of הנאה (benefit).
And when it is written <b>יֵאָכל</b> (eaten) in passive voice, it means the prohibition of הנאה (benefit), according to all opinions.

Klal 459

When something is permissible for benefit, it uses the language <b>לכם</b> (for you) or a pronoun, as in <b>קצירכם</b> (your harvest), etc.
And the language <b>יעשה למלאכה</b> does not include using for benefit.<br><br><i>Leviticus 11:10 says,</i>וכל אשר אין לו סנפיר וקשקשת בימים ובנחלים מכל שרץ המים ומכל נפש החיה אשר במים שקץ הם לכם<i> (And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that swarm in the waters, and of all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are a detestable thing unto you), using the word לכם for “to you”. This means that they are permissible for benefit, according to Rule 459<sup class="footnote-marker">691</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Shemini 81.</i>.</i><br><br><i>Leviticus 7:24 says, </i>וחלב נבלה וחלב טרפה יעשה לכל מלאכה ואכל לא תאכלהו<i> (And the fat of that which dies of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of beasts, may be used for any other service; but you shall in no wise eat of it), using the words </i>יעשה לכל מלאכה<i> for “may be used for any other service”. This does not include using for benefit, according to Rule 459<sup class="footnote-marker">692</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Tzav 139.</i>.</i>

Klal 460

Whenever the noun <b>כף</b> (palm) comes alone, it means the palm of the hand. It always comes alone (except for three places), but <b>כף רגל</b> (palm of the foot) always comes in construct state. And thus, the sages of blessed memory infer that when it says כל הולך על כפיו (whatsoever goes upon its paws)<sup class="footnote-marker">693</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 11:27.</i>, this is a monkey.
And there is a difference between <b>רגל</b> (foot) and <b>כף רגל</b> (palm of the foot): כף רגל indicates the bottom of the foot, while <b>רגל</b> indicates all of it.<br><br><i>Since in Leviticus 11:27, </i>כל הולך על כפיו<i> (whatsoever goes upon its paws), the word כפיו (its paws) comes alone, by Rule 460 it must mean the palms of one’s hands. Then since the only animal that goes upon the palms of its hands is a monkey (its feet are also considered hands, since they can also grab things), it must be talking about a monkey<sup class="footnote-marker">694</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Shemini 103.</i>.</i>

Klal 461

There is a difference between the verb <b>שבת</b> (rest) and the verbs <b>חשך , מנע , חדל</b> (stop) that are synonymous with it: The verb <b>שבת</b> always teaches that it is an interruption from a matter that one was occupied with until now or that the matter that one was occupied with until now was cancelled from existence. Not so for the other verbs, as they indicate preventing or ceasing in the <i>future</i>.

Klal 462

There is a difference between <b>בו</b> and <b>בתוכו</b> (inside it): Whenever it says <i>ששם דבר <b>בדבר</b></i> (there is something in something) the thing does not have to be inside. But when it says <i>שיושם <b>בתוך</b> דבר</i> (placed inside something) – if it is referring to the vessel, it will be surrounded by three sides, while if it is referring to things that are grouped together, the word תוך will mean at the midpoint.
And this is what differentiates <b>תוך</b> and <b>קֶרב</b> - the word קרב is not strict in that it will be at the midpoint or surrounded all around. And the word <b>קֶרב</b> comes from the perspective of water inside the stomach or food inside one’s cavities. But <b>תוך</b> is not correct with this, since there is no barrier and no midpoint in it.

Klal 463

The verb <b>כסה</b> (cover) in its precise meaning is connected with the nouns <b>בגד שלמה</b> (outfit), etc. And in its broad meaning, it includes anything that wraps around another thing.
And there is a difference between <b>ויכס שק</b> (and covered him with sackcloth)<sup class="footnote-marker">695</sup><i class="footnote">Jonah 3:6.</i> and <b>מתכסים בשקים</b> (covered with sackcloth)<sup class="footnote-marker">696</sup><i class="footnote">2 Kings 19:2.</i> in that whenever <b>כסה</b> has the prefix ב after it, it means that he covered himself around and around.

Klal 464

There is a difference between <b>ראשון</b> (first) and <b>קדמון</b> (ancient): <b>קדמון</b> is roughly late, not necessarily first. And from this perspective, <b>קדמון</b> is sometimes not to be taken as absolutely ancient.

Klal 465

There is a difference between <b>פה</b> (mouth) and <b>שפה</b> (lip): <b>שפה</b> is the exterior of the mouth. And the word <b>פה</b> indicates words of חכמה (wisdom), while שפה indicates words of דעת (knowledge).<br><br><i>The difference between </i>חכמה<i> and </i>דעת<i> according to Rashi is that </i>חכמה<i> is what one hears from others and learns, while </i>דעת<i> is Divine inspiration. Also, Rashi defines </i>תבונה<i> (understanding) as comprehension of a matter with one’s intellect based on what he has already learned<sup class="footnote-marker">697</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi’s Commentary on the Torah, Exodus 31:3.</i>.</i>

Klal 466

There is a difference between <b>נשאר</b> and <b>נותר</b> (remain): <b>נשאר</b> indicates that it remains intentionally, while <b>נותר</b>indicates that it remains of its own accord but not intentionally.
And from this, the difference furthermore stands in that <b>נשאר</b> was not joint with the whole, while <b>נותר</b> was joint with the whole.<br><br><i>Leviticus 10:12 says, </i>וידבר משה אל אהרן ואל אלעזר ואל איתמר בניו הנותרים קחו את המנחה הנותרת מאשי יהוה ואכלוה מצות אצל המזבח כי קדש קדשים הוא<i> (And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons that were left: 'Take the meal-offering that remains of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar; for it is most holy). The word </i>הנותרים<i> was used for “that were left”and not the word הנשארים, since Eleazar and Ithamar remained alive of their own accord but not intentionally<sup class="footnote-marker">698</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Shemini 41.</i>.</i>

Klal 467

The noun <b>מים</b> (water) includes all waters in the world, even water in vessels, unless the noun <b>מים</b> comes <i>versus</i> ארץ (land); then it is only talking about water that is on land.
<b>ימים</b> (seas) and <b>נחלים</b> (rivers) come as proper nouns.
And in its precise meaning, the word <b>ימים</b> are the great spaces that God created on the third day of Creation (and according to Rabbi Yehuda, it was only the Mediterranean Sea) and <b>נחלים</b> (rivers) are also deep places that attract and flow.
And in its broad meaning, the noun נחלים also includes bodies of water that attract but do not flow. And the noun ימים also includes bodies of water that flow but do not attract.

Klal 468

There is a difference between <b>עין</b> and <b>מעין</b> (spring) – The <b>עין</b> is found in a valley before the water gushes out, while <b>מעין</b> indicates water gushing to the outside.
And there is a difference between <b>מעין</b> (spring) and <b>באר</b> (well). A <b>באר</b> is deep but not a <b>מעין</b>.
And there is a difference between <b>באר</b> and <b>בור</b> (pit). The <b>בור</b> – water is collected. The <b>באר</b> – its water flows out. And the linguists use <b>בור</b> in the language of excavation in rocks or in hard land, and <b>באר</b> in the language of digging and mining.

Klal 469

There is a difference between <b>מקור</b> (source) and <b>מבוע</b> (spring): <b>מקור</b> is the place where a spring of water which extends deep in the ground begins, while <b>מבוע</b> indicates the flow of the source to the outside.

Klal 470

The language <b>הבדלה</b> (differentiation) applies to similar matters which are distinguished with a tiny difference, and it does not apply to completely separate matters.
And there is a difference between <b>להבדיל</b> (to distinguish) and <b>להורות</b> (to indicate): <b>להבדיל</b> is from the senses, while <b>להורות</b> is theoretical.

Klal 471

There is a difference between <b>הוראה</b> and <b>לימוד</b> (instruction):
The מלמד habituates his students – if with leadership or with a certain wisdom, while the מורה teaches him the matter once.
The לימוד will sometimes be with words that come from the heart of the teacher and his ideas, while the מורה only teaches matters found in reality or what he received from his rabbis or from books.

Klal 472

<b>לידה</b> (childbirth) in its broad meaning includes even when a baby is born via a caesarian section, but when it says תזריע וילדה, it indicates that the baby is born in the natural way.

Klal 473

The Hebrew indicates the division between a male and a female (as long as it talks in the sense of one’s offspring) with the nouns <b>בן</b> (son) and <b>בת</b> (daughter). And with respect to the nouns <b>זכר</b> (male) and <b>נקבה</b> (female), this only indicates that it is talking about adults, or that it is not in the sense of the fathers who begot them, or that they are not human.

Klal 474

The noun <b>בן</b> (son) indicates that the fetus completed its months of gestation, while the noun<b>זכר</b> (male) includes even a stillborn.

Klal 475

In the chapter about נגעים (plagues), it sometimes uses <b>בעור בשרו</b> (in the skin of his flesh) and sometimes uses just <b>בעור</b> (in the skin). And עור בשרו includes places that are not proper for hair. And any place where it talks about white hair, it will use בעור בשרו to teach that even in places which do not grow hair, it is unclean.

Klal 476

<b>בהרת</b> (bright spot) is the shiny appearance and includes all hues. And thus, it has to say בהרת לבנה (white bright spot) to indicate a white color.
And <b>השאת</b> (rising) looks swollen, since it is not shiny.
And <b>הספחת</b> (scab) is secondary to <b>בהרת</b> and <b>השאת</b>.<br><br><i>Leviticus 13:2 says,</i>אדם כי יהיה בעור בשרו שאת או ספחת או בהרת והיה בעור בשרו לנגע צרעת והובא אל אהרן הכהן או אל אחד מבניו הכהנים<i> (When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, or a scab, or a bright spot, and it become in the skin of his flesh the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons the priests), using the words </i>בהרת<i> for a bright spot, </i>שאת<i> for a rising, and </i>ספחת<i> for a scab.</i>

Klal 477

The nouns <b>שאת</b> (rising) and <b>בהרת</b> (bright spot) indicate a change in appearance, while the noun <b>נגע</b> (plague) indicates the suffering. And the nouns שאת ובהרת only indicate uncleanness when it says the noun נגע (plague) or the noun צרעת (leprosy).

Klal 478

Sometimes it mentions the noun <b>נגע</b> (plague), and sometimes the noun <b>צרעת</b> (leprosy), and sometimes <b>נגע צרעת</b> (plague of leprosy). And there is a rule in this:
The noun נגע indicates the diseases that produce white hair, and thus this noun is mentioned in the chapter which talks about white hair.
And the noun צרעת indicates the diseases that produce raw flesh and is mentioned in the chapter which talks about raw flesh.
And thus, the noun נגע refers to a bright spot in that its way is to produce white hair, while the noun צרעת refers to a rising in that its way is to produce raw flesh.
And any place where it is not this way and it mentions the noun צרעת instead of the noun נגע – it comes to teach that its law is like the law for raw flesh, that its size must be at least the size of a split bean.

Klal 479

When it is written <b>מספחת היא</b> (it is a scab)<sup class="footnote-marker">699</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:6.</i>, the sages interpret it to mean <i>like a scab</i>.
And when it is written <b>בשר חי</b> (raw flesh)<sup class="footnote-marker">700</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:14.</i>, the sages interpret it to mean raw flesh that returns confers uncleanness.
And when it is written <b>צרבת</b> (scar)<sup class="footnote-marker">701</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:23.</i>, the sages interpret it to mean that its place must be compact and distinct.
And when it is written <b>צהוב</b> (yellow)<sup class="footnote-marker">702</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:30.</i>, the sages interpret it to mean like gold.
And when it is written <b>דק</b> (thin)<sup class="footnote-marker">703</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>, the sages interpret it to mean thin, shriveled, and short.

Klal 480

There is a difference between <b>עין</b> when it is teaching about the color of the plague and <b>מראה</b> (appearance): עין indicates the color alone, and מראה indicates all of the details that are seen in it.
<b>מראה הנגע</b> (appearance of the plague) is not the matter as it really is, only the appearance to the eye.

Klal 481

The verb <b>הפך</b> (reverse) is only used with respect to a change - a change in place and situation, character and quality. And we find it both as an intransitive verb and a transitive verb. And when it is an intransitive verb, it means that it acts on itself, that it reverses itself. And it only comes on an entity that has free-will.

Klal 482

And whenever the verb הפך (turn) is used with respect to a change in quality, the prefix letter ל will come afterwards – for example <b>נהפך ללבן</b> (turned to white). And when it comes without the prefix letter ל afterwards, for example <b>נהפך לבן</b> (turned white) – it teaches that it was not changed completely, only partially.

Klal 483

The word <b>כהה</b> (dim) refers to an object that is weakened in its strength. And with respect to plagues, it means dim in appearance. And it is depicted as that which is weak in appearance, either completely or slightly, from an intense appearance to a dim appearance.
And when it is written והנה כֵהָה הנגע (behold, the plague be dim)<sup class="footnote-marker">704</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:56.</i>, it is with a verb, not with the noun כֵהֶה; this teaches that it is slightly weak.

Klal 484

And there is a difference between <b>הפך הנגע את עינו</b> (if the plague have not changed its colour)<sup class="footnote-marker">705</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:55.</i> and <b>כהה הנגע</b>(if the plague be dim)<sup class="footnote-marker">706</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:6.</i>: כהה is weakened from a strong appearance to a weak appearance, while הפך עינו is to a different appearance, like from reddish to greenish.

Klal 485

<b>עמוק</b>, <b>שפל</b>, <b>פחתת</b> (low):
<b>עמוק</b> (deep) is from all sides.
<b>שפל</b> (low) is from one side.
<b>פחתת</b> (fret) means that the plague sinks into the depth of the garment.
And moreover, when it is written about the plagues in the walls of a house with <b>שקערורות</b> (hollow streaks)<sup class="footnote-marker">707</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticcus 14:37.</i>, it is from the theme of sinking into the depth of the stones.

Klal 486

<b>תחת</b> (under) and <b>מטה</b> (down) - תחת is a preposition which refers to something that is below that which is on top of it, butמטה will be said in terms of itself.
And when the word תחת refers to a place, it indicates the place which rests under that which is standing.

Klal 487

And there is a difference between <b>תחתיו</b> and <b>במקומו</b> (in its place): <b>במקומו</b> includes a large boundary that is unique to a certain thing, but <b>תחתיו</b> is only the place that is under it.
And the word תחתיו may refer to a thing that is on the side of something, while being lower than it.<br><br><i>Genesis 29:26 says, ויאמר לבן לא יעשה כן במקומנו לתת הצעירה לפני הבכירה (And Laban said: 'It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the first-born’), using the language במקומנו for “our place”. This means the whole city<sup class="footnote-marker">708</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Tazria 108.</i>.</i>

Klal 488

And there is a difference between <b>על דם האשם</b> (upon the blood of the guilt-offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">709</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:17.</i> and <b>על מקום דם האשם</b> (upon the place of the blood of the guilt offering)<sup class="footnote-marker">710</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:28.</i>: על מקום (upon the place) is the place where it first was, even if it is not now. And it was called על מקום only when it was ready to be there but not before then.

Klal 489

The noun and verb <b>פרח</b> (noun: flower, verb: bloom) is used primarily when talking about a seedling. And it is different than <b>ציץ</b> (bud) which indicates the sprouting of the material carrying its fruit and its sproutlings, which is sometimes before the blooming and sometimes after it. And this meaning is borrowed to describe anything which sprouts very slowly. And this is when it says ואם פרוח תפרח הצרעת וכסתה (And if the leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover)<sup class="footnote-marker">711</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:12.</i>; it means to say that it sprouts very slowly.

Klal 490

And we find פרח to be synonymous with <b>התעופפות</b> (flying). And the difference between them is that the verb <b>התעופפות</b> refers to all types of flying, while the verb פרח refers only to flying from below to above.

Klal 491

So the verb <b>פרח</b> (blossom) is not correct with respect to birth of a body itself, only its fruit and growth. And thus, in a place where the verb פרח refers to the birth of a plague, the sages of blessed memory interpret it to mean its spread. And in a place where they are unable to explain it as such, they will borrow its interpretation from the topic of buds of flowers and their varieties.
And the language <b>פשה</b> (spread) can be found on a plague that returns, and there is a homiletical interpretation<sup class="footnote-marker">712</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:44.</i>.

Klal 492

There is a difference between <b>ראש</b> (head) and <b>קדקד</b> (top of the head): The noun קדקד refers to the upper side of the head, and the verb that is derived from it ויקדו (nod) is the bending of the top of the head downward, as in the verb כריעה (kneel) which refers to the bending of the כרעים (knees). But the noun ראש (head) includes all of the head.
And we find that כי ימרט ראשו (And if a man's hair be fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is he clean)<sup class="footnote-marker">713</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:40.</i> refers to the back of his head alone – and there is a homiletical interpretation.

Klal 493

The words <b>נתק</b>and <b>קרחת</b> (baldness) are different:
<b>נתק</b> refers only to part of the head, while <b>קרחת</b> refers also to all of the head.
<b>נתק</b> is only through Heaven, while <b>קרחת</b> can be through Heaven or through man.
When <b>קרחת</b> comes from Heaven and it affects part of the head, it is different than <b>נתק</b> in that for <b>נתק</b> there is a possibility of being healed, but for <b>קרחת</b> through Heaven there is no possibility of being healed.

Klal 494

The noun <b>שפתים</b> (lips) always comes in plural, since they come in pairs. And the noun <b>שפם</b> (upper lip) comes in a time in which one’s lips are restrained from speaking, for example in a time of mourning.

Klal 495

The words <b>בדד</b> and <b>גלמוד</b>(alone): An inhabitant is גלמוד if he is distant from everyone. Not so for an inhabitant who is בדד, which can also be depicted as עם לבדד ישכן (a people that shall dwell alone)<sup class="footnote-marker">714</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 23:9.</i>.

Klal 496

There is a difference between <b>ארז - ברוש, ארזים – ברושים</b> (cedar and cypress) and <b>עץ ארץ , עצי ארזים , עצי ברושים</b> (wood of land, cedar wood, cypress wood): Any place where it says עץ ארז ועצי ברושים, it means trees that are cut. But the noun<b>ארז-ארזים</b> (cedar) comes whether the wood is cut or is still connected to the tree. And when it refers to cutting, it means whole cedars while they are still connected to the tree.

Klal 497

The noun <b>דל</b> (poor) teaches about the reduction of a certain matter from that which it was, in either body, money, or honor, etc. And it is depicted in <i>Sifra</i> as someone becoming poor relative to when he was previously very wealthy, although he is not really poor. And when it adds <b>ואין ידו משגת</b> (and his means suffice not)<sup class="footnote-marker">715</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:21.</i>, it means <i>completely poor</i>. And it is depicted in <i>Sifra</i> that ואין ידו משגת for another reason; thus, it says דל ואין ידו משגת (he be poor, and his means suffice not)<sup class="footnote-marker">716</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>.<br><br><i>According to Sifra, when it says ואין ידו משגת, it could mean that he has the means, but they are not readily available. Thus, it adds the word </i>דל<i> so that it means he is completely poor. And according to Sifra, when it says </i>דל<i>, it could mean that he is not really poor, just poorer than he once was. Thus, it adds the words ואין ידו משגת so that it means he is completely poor. Hence, both</i>דל <i>and </i>ואין ידו משגת<i> are needed as conditions in Leviticus 14:21<sup class="footnote-marker">717</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Metzora 63.</i>.</i>

Klal 498

The words <b>רר , רק , זב , נטף , נזל</b>:
The noun <b>רר</b> (drool) and the noun <b>רק</b> (spit) refer to the saliva that drips from the mouth. And it is called <b>רק</b> in a time when it is emptied and expelled with force, while <b>רר</b> drips on its own.
And <b>רר</b> is different from <b>זב</b> (drip), in that <b>רר</b> means dripping from the body alone, while <b>זב</b> includes any moist matter that drips and flows.
And <b>זב</b> is distinguished from <b>הנוזל</b> and <b>ניגר</b> (flow) in that <b>זב</b> comes in little drops, while הנוזל והניגר come in abundance.
Nevertheless, the drops of <b>זב</b> and <b>רר</b> are close to one another, while the drops of נוטף (dripping) stop one after another.

Klal 499

And there is a difference between <b>ירק</b> (with a resting first radical) and <b>רקק</b> (with repeated last two radicals): <b>ירק</b> is designated for saliva that exits from the mouth, and רקק includes also drool, mucus, and phlegm.
And with respect to the special verbs for spilling and disposing and the verb רק, the word עליו always comes afterwards. And the prefix letter ב that comes afterwards is only correct when it is in conjunction with יד (hand).

Klal 500

<b>מחתה</b> (censer) and <b>מקטרת</b> (pipe): with a <b>מחתה</b>, one stirred the fire, and with a <b>מקטרת</b>, one burned incense on the coals that were given from the מחתה. And sometimes, incense was burned on the מחתה.

Klal 501

The words <b>עשן</b> (smoke) and <b>ענן</b> (cloud): עשן andקיטור (smoke) come from boiling rain, while ענן is a special name for vapor that goes up and comes together as one (when it is scattered, it is called <b>ערפל</b> - fog). And these words are borrowed for the theme of incense when there is an herb going up as smoke and for the cloud that is created during the time when the Presence of Glory is revealed.

Klal 502

<b>העינוי</b> (suffering) comes on any matter of pain that one will feel through the subjugation of the powers of one’s soul. And in any place where העינוי is ascribed to the soul, it will always will be through the lack of eating and drinking. And העינוי will be according to the temperament of the man; there can be light suffering and difficult suffering. And העינוי is the same for all humans in precisely the lack of food and drink.

Klal 503

The verb and noun <b>ציד</b> (hunt):
In its precise meaning, it only refers to that which is hunted through a trap.
And in its broad meaning, it includes preparation of food and necessities in general.

Klal 504

There is a difference between <b>עפר</b> (dirt) and <b>אדמה</b> (earth) with respect to detachment from the earth: It will say the nounאדמה when talking about a clods of earth attached together as a whole, while the noun עפר is about the morsel and the eroded. In its precise meaning, it means only the dirt of the ground, and in its broad meaning, it also includes crushed stones, bricks, and clay.

Klal 505

<b>קציר</b> (harvesting) in its precise meaning is only with a sickle. And with respect to detachment, it will say <b>משרש</b> and <b>עוקר</b> (uproot). And with respect to cutting off stalks, it will say <b>מולל</b> (crush), <b>קמל</b> (wither), etc.
And in its broad meaning, the noun <b>קציר</b> refers to all techniques of harvesting.
<b>קציר</b> alone refers to grains, but also with respect to legumes, it uses the particular languageקציר הארץ (harvesting the land) and קציר שדה (harvesting the field).

Klal 506

The noun <b>שדה</b> (field) in its precise meaning is a field of only seeds. And in its broad meaning, it also includes a place of trees.
השדה is in the middle, between a city and a desert; and thus, it is used to speak by way of metaphor for any intermediate matter, as it does with a private altar<sup class="footnote-marker">718</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 17:5. There it refers to a private altar with the language על פני השדה (in the open field).</i> (which is in the middle, between the Temple in Jerusalem and the Tabernacle in the desert), in the learning of the <i>Mishnah</i> (which is in the middle, between the Scripture and the <i>Gemara</i>), about a young girl who is engaged (who is in the middle, between a single girl and a married woman): The young girl who is engaged is referred to with the noun שדה opposite of the poetic language to call a woman with the noun אהל (tent) or the noun בית (house); thus, the sages of blessed memory interpret וישב מחוץ לאהלו (but shall dwell outside his tent)<sup class="footnote-marker">719</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:8.</i> to be about permitted relations.

Klal 507

There is a difference between <b>לקט</b> (collect in simple conjugation) and <b>ליקט</b> (collect in intensive conjugation):
Collection that is with difficulty because everything is spread out comes in intensive conjugation.
And also the sages of blessed memory explain that <b>לקט</b> (collection) for others comes as a transitive verb.

Klal 508

The noun <b>עוללות</b> (gleanings) is borrowed from <i>infants/toddlers</i> to mean small clusters of grapes, i.e., gleanings. And the noun <b>אשכולות</b> (clusters) is borrowed from <i>wine</i> to mean men of great virtue.
The verb <b>בצר</b> (to pick grapes) is used with <b>אשכולות</b> and the verb <b>עולל</b> (glean) is used with <b>עוללות</b>. And there are two concepts associated with <b>עוללות</b>: The concept of taking the gleanings and the concept the minutia and the delay, since the gleanings are collected in the end.

Klal 509

There is a difference between leaving gifts for the poor with the language <b>נתינה</b> (give) and leaving unharvested produce in the corners of the field with the language <b>עזיבה</b> (leave) in that there is no need to give the produce that is left unharvested, only to place it before them while they are left to waste.
And moreover, there is a difference between <b>עזיבה</b> and <b>הוצאה</b>, in that <b>עזיבה</b> is not clean from straw and chaff.

Klal 510

Planting of trees is found with the language <b>נטיעה</b>, <b>זריעה</b>, <b>שתילה</b> (planting), and there is a difference between them:
The verb נטע comes when one places seed in the ground (unless one attaches a sapling to a tree).
And the verb זרע (sowing) refers to the layering of hybrids of two different species.
The verb שתל specifies a tree that one uproots from its place and plants in another place.

Klal 511

There is a difference between <b>עץ מאכל</b> (tree for food) and <b>עץ פרי</b> (fruit tree): <b>עץ מאכל</b> means that it will be special for eating, not for a fence or for beams of wood.
And there is a difference between <b>פרי</b> (fruit) and <b>תבואה</b> (grain): <b>פרי</b> also includes fruit while still in the status of growth, but תבואה is finished growing.

Klal 512

The name <b>הויה</b> (The Tetragrammaton, the Hebrew word for God which is derived from the verb “to be”) is called such, because He brings into being everything. And the name <b>אלקים</b> (God) is called such, from the forces that He limits with measurement and restriction. And thus, the name הויה represents mercy, while the the name אלקים represents judgement.
And the name אלקים that comes with a pronoun representing Israel teaches about special Divine Providence. And the name אלקים is not found with a singular pronoun, except when it refers to a prophet or a king.

Klal 513

<b>חוקים</b> (statutes) are general laws for which there is no reason. And וחוקי ה' (statutes of God) usually include commandments between man and God. And <b>המשפטים</b> (laws) are laws between man and his fellow man, and there are reasons for them.
And the noun חוקים is also used to refer to homiletical interpretations from the perspective that interpretations in the Oral Law are based on the rules of language and their statutes.
And moreover, the noun חוקים refers to the laws of the nature which limit God in His world.

Klal 514

There is a difference between <b>זכירה</b> and <b>פקידה</b> (remembrance): <b>פקידה</b> is through an inspection of actions.

Klal 515

<b>קדושה</b> (holiness) means: 1) refraining from secular matters. 2) Rising above the ways of nature and the material.
And there are many levels to <b>קדושה</b>.

Klal 516

There is a difference between <b>ירא</b> (fear) when the word את comes afterwards and <b>ירא</b> when the letterמ comes afterwards: <b>ירא את</b> is referring to the thing itself that one fears. And <b>ירא מן</b> is referring to the cause of the fear.<br><br><i>1 Samuel 14:26 says, ויבא העם אל היער והנה הלך דבש ואין משיג ידו אל פיו כי ירא העם את השבעה (And when the people were come unto the forest, behold a flow of honey; but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath), using the words כי ירא העם את השבעה for “for the people feared the oath”. This is an example of referring to the thing itself that one fears, namely the oath.</i><br><br><i>Deuteronomy 5:5 says,אנכי עמד בין יהוה וביניכם בעת ההוא להגיד לכם את דבר יהוה כי יראתם מפני האש ולא עליתם בהר לאמר (I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to declare to you the word of the LORD; for you were afraid because of the fire, and went not up to the mount—saying), using the words כי יראתם מפני האש for “for you were afraid because of the fire”.

Klal 517

There is a difference between <b>משפט</b> (law) and <b>צדק</b> (justice): <b>משפט</b> is according to the letter of the law, while <b>צדק</b> focuses on the matter at hand and the ones being judged according to the needs of the time, place, and what is right, etc.
And when the noun צדק comes to modify the noun משפט, it means that the law will not deviate from justice and truth.

Klal 518

The verb <b>עשק</b> (oppress), according to the sages of blessed memory, refers primarily to additions and excess. And it is used when one withholds the wages of a hired worker by saying to him that the money that he wants as his wages is more than what he is owed, and from this the employer becomes accustomed to all types of withholding wages of hired workers.

Klal 519

There is a difference between a <b>שכר</b> and <b>פעולה</b> (laborer):
The noun פעולה focuses on the particulars of the labor that one performs, while the nounשכר focuses on the payment alone.
Or for example,שכר focuses on one’s wages for a period of time, and it focuses according to what is stipulated with it; the craftsman accepts for the sake of his labor and the salaried employee according to a fixed payment.
And there are more differences in thatשכר only refers to who gets paid, not what is worked on through a middleman. But <b></b> פעולהrefers also to what gets worked on through a middleman.

Klal 520

The noun<b>חרש</b> (deaf and mute person) refers to two things, not hearing and not speaking.
And moreover, the noun <b>עור</b> (blind person) refers to two things, blindness of the eye and blindness of the heart. And opposite blindness of the heart comes the verb <b>פקח</b> (open). And thus, the phraseעור עיניו (blind in his eyes) is used several times to exclude blindness of the heart.
And the nounעור (blind person) also includes blindness in one eye. And moreover, the noun<b>פסח</b> (cripple) – can also mean cripple on one foot; unless it explains: את עיני צדקיהו עור (and put out the eyes of Zedekiah)<sup class="footnote-marker">721</sup><i class="footnote">2 Kings 25:7.</i>, והוא פסח על שתי רגליו (and he was lame on both his feet)<sup class="footnote-marker">722</sup><i class="footnote">2 Samuel 9:13.</i>.
<b>והצולע</b> (lame) - his thigh was collapsed, and he goes on one limp. And a פסח skips. And both can also be from birth. But <b>נכה רגלים</b> (crippled legs) is precisely through being beaten.

Klal 521

<b>הוד</b> and <b>הדר</b> (splendor) – The word הדר is a special exterior beauty which refers to anything that is magnificent in its species. And הוד refers to the interior essence which makes the thing beautiful in its appearance.
<b>נשיאת פנים</b> (respect) is when He spares a certain disaster or evil matter, and He passes over it.

Klal 522

There is a difference between the verb <b>יכח</b> (rebuke) if it comes with the prefix letter ל or the word <b>עם</b> (with), or the word <b>את</b> afterwards:
<b>יכח לפלוני</b> and <b>יכח עם פלוני</b> are rebuke through reason. And <b>יכח עם פלוני</b> – both of them argue together and exchange their words with one another.
But <b>יכח את</b> is close to the theme of מוסר (rebuke), that he rebukes him about a particular sin that he made.

Klal 523

And there is a difference between <b>מוסר</b> and <b>תוכחה</b> (reproof): <b>מוסר</b> compels one to be chastised, with either whips or words, and it comes from great to small, and it is usually about the future. And <b>תוכחה</b> is usually with proof/evidence and is usually about the past.

Klal 524

<b>נקם</b> and <b>נטר</b> (vengeance/bearing a grudge): <b>נקם</b> is with action, while <b>נטר</b> is in the heart.
And there is a difference between <b>נוטר</b>, ל<b>שומר</b>, and <b>נוצר</b> (guard) - נוטר is only with words of reason.

Klal 525

The words <b>שונא ,אויב ,צר</b> (hate/enemy):
<b>השנאה</b> has concealed hatred.
<b>האויב</b> is his revealed enemy, but does not cause actual harm.
<b>הצר</b> does cause actual harm.

Klal 526

The verb <b>אהב</b> (love) is always linked with את. And when it is written ואהבת לרעך כמוך (you shall love your neighbour as yourself)<sup class="footnote-marker">723</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 19:18.</i>, it means he would love for his friend to attain whatever he wants to attain for himself. And this is the difference between the word את, which teaches about the essence of the action and the letter ל, which teaches about the attainment of the matter.<br><br><i>It is impossible for a person to love his neighbor as he loves himself. However, it is possible for a person to love for his neighbor to attain whatever he wants to attain for himself. This is why the Torah uses the letter ל in Leviticus 19:18 when commanding a person to love his neighbor as himself<sup class="footnote-marker">724</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Kedoshim 45.</i>.</i>

Klal 527

The verb <b>בקר</b> (investigation) comes on the origin of the matter, to know its nature and its character. And there is logical ביקור in which they investigate a person getting hit in court and inform of his sin through a reading.
And ביקור is not correct with respect to an investigation as to whether a matter is real; it is only correct with respect to the study of a matter that is known to be real.

Klal 528

The verb <b>נאף</b> (adultery) only applies to a married woman (it comes from אף כי קנאה חמת גבר - For jealousy is the rage of a man<sup class="footnote-marker">725</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 6:34.</i>).
And for the woman, the verb <b>נאף</b> and the verb <b>זנה</b> apply. נאף is with respect to copulation and זנה is with respect to inviting herself to be invalidated or to make herself available. And thus, with respect to the male, the verb זנה is never used anywhere; only with respect to involving himself with idol worship.
And there is a difference between <b>נאף</b> in simple conjugation and <b>מנאף</b> in intensive conjugation, in that <b>מנאף</b> means that one causes someone else to commit adultery.

Klal 529

There is a difference between <b>שכב אותה</b> and <b>שכב עמה</b> (lie with her): <b>שכב עמה</b> includes lying down even in an unnatural way, while <b>שכב אותה</b> indicates lying down precisely in the natural way. And any place where it speaks in a way of modesty, it will use the language שכב עמו.
And with respect to lying with a male, the language שכב את is not correct, and from this the sages of blessed memory conclude that when it is written את זכר לא תשכב (You shall not lie with mankind, as with womankind)<sup class="footnote-marker">726</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 18:22.</i>, it is a warning against lying down with another male in the passive way.

Klal 530

There is a difference between <b>הערה</b> (made naked) and <b>גילה</b> (uncover): העראה is an attachment to the place of the nakedness. Thus, with respect to a menstruating woman, it does not use the language <b>גילה</b>, only the language <b>הערה</b>, as she is permissible to him. And also with a sister of a father, it says הערה to teach that for both of them, the prohibition of העראה applies as soon as the intercourse is finished.
In all places, the language <b>ביאה</b> (copulation) and <b>קריבה</b> (closeness) with a woman come before the word אל. But when it is written with respect to the law of a childless widow awaiting Levirate marriage יבמה <b>יבוא עליה</b> (her husband's brother shall go in to her)<sup class="footnote-marker">727</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 25:5.</i>, it teaches that it is forced.
And the verb <b>רבע</b> (mate) is only found with respect to pairing of two things that are not of the same species, and the sages of blessed memory interpret it to mean pairs of animals in general.
And an explanation of the noun <b>שכבת זרע</b> (flow of seed) – See above citations.
For <b>נדה , דוה , זבה</b>, see the above citations.

Klal 531

The noun <b>מזימה</b> (conspiracy/plot) is derived from the verb <b>זמם</b> (conspiring), which can sometimes be for good and sometimes for evil. And the noun <b>זימה</b> (lewdness) in particular specifies the immersion of one’s thoughts into sin and immorality. And in the Torah, this noun is only found with respect to the profanity of one’s daughter with immorality<sup class="footnote-marker">728</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 19:29.</i> and the uncovering the nakedness of a woman and her daughter<sup class="footnote-marker">729</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 18:17.</i>.
And matters of immorality come in the Scripture in a special language– <b>תועבה</b> (abomination), <b>זימה</b> (lewdness), <b>חסד</b> (shameful), etc., and each one is needed for a special homiletical interpretation.
And all immorality uses the language <b>שכיבה</b> (lying down), and lying with one’s sister or the wife of one’s brother uses <b>לקיחה</b>. And there is a reason for this in accordance with its simple meaning. And with respect to uncovering the nakedness of a woman and her mother, it also uses <b>לקיחה</b>, and there is something special to learn from this.<br><br><i>Leviticus 20:14 says, </i>ואיש אשר יקח את אשה ואת אמה זמה הוא באש ישרפו אתו ואתהן ולא תהיה זמה בתוככם<i> (And if a man take with his wife also her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.), using the verb </i>יקח<i> for “take”. This is to teach that the man is liable only because he married a woman and then lay with her daughter. But if he had forced or seduced a woman and then lay with her daughter, the verse would not pertain to him<sup class="footnote-marker">730</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Kedoshim 110.</i>.</i>

Klal 532

The language <b>לקיחה</b> (taking) a woman is used whether it is talking about betrothal or marriage. But when it says <b>לקח לאשה</b> with the prefix <b>ל</b>, it is only talking about betrothal that is the beginning of the <b>לקיחה</b>, not about entering the wedding canopy after betrothal. And moreover, this language is correct with respect to a levirate marriage, since that is also the beginning of <b>לקיחה</b>.
And moreover, it uses the language <b>קנה</b> (acquire) and <b>קנין</b> (acquisition) with respect to marriage to a woman. And this is the difference between the verb <b>קנה</b> and the verb <b>כרה</b> (buy): The verb <b>כרה</b> comes only on that which is acquired through selling, while the verb <b>קנה</b> includes all types of acquisition of something that will be his.

Klal 533

And there is a difference between <b>קנין</b> or <b>מקנה</b> (acquisition) when written alone and <b>מקנת כסף</b> or <b>קנין כסף</b> (acquisition of money): <b>קנין</b> includes anything that is in his possession, even for a period of time, whileקנין כסף indicates what is his without a doubt.

Klal 534

There is a difference between the noun <b>כלה</b> and <b>אשת הבן</b> (daughter-in-law), as one only uses the noun <b>אשת הבן</b> when the son is alive, while the noun <b>כלה</b> can also be used after the son dies.
And the noun <b>כלה</b> is correct also if his daughter-in-law is a servant or a Gentile. Not so with<b>אשת הבן</b>, as it is only used when the woman is married with aקידושין (sanctification).

Klal 535

And there is a difference between the noun <b>דוד</b> (uncle) and the noun <b>אחי האב</b> (brother of the father): The noun <b>דוד</b> only means the paternal brother of his father, while the noun <b>אחי האב</b> also includes the maternal brother of his father.

Klal 536

And the noun <b>שאר</b> (kin) is synonymous with <b>בשר</b> (flesh). And its main idea is <i>something similar</i> and that it melts into the flesh of man, that from this it comes on the flesh that is prepared for human consumption and on the food itself. Also, the concept of קורבה (kin) is synonymous with it.
And there is a difference between <b>שארו</b> (his kin) alone and <b>שאר בשרו</b> (near of kin to him): <b>שאר</b> alone only comes when referring to an immediate relative (and they are his wife and the remainder of relatives that are mentioned with respect to the uncleanness of priests). But<b>שאר בשרו</b> also includes non-immediate relatives.

Klal 537

And there is a difference between <b>קרוב לו</b> and <b>קרוב אליו</b> (close to him): For whoever is standing facing close, it will say קרוב אליו, and for whoever is not facing close, it will say קרוב לו. And thus, the language קרוב לו comes to describe one’s sense of being. And moreover, it comes to describe one’s distant relatives.

Klal 538

All forms of the death penalty administered by a Jewish court are mentioned explicitly in the Torah. And the death penalty by sword is a law that was given to Moses at Mount Sinai and is hinted to in the text, according the Maimonides. And any place where it is written alone <b>מות יומת</b> (shall surely be put to death), it means through strangulation.
And there is a difference between <b>מיתה</b> (death) and the rest of terminologies for death (like <b>הכאה</b> (beating), <b>הריגה</b> (manslaughter), etc.) in that the word <b>מיתה</b> does not indicate how one dies.
And any place where it is written <b>דמיהם בם</b> (their blood shall be upon them), it is referring to death by stoning. And this comes from the plural דמיהם (their blood), and from the language בו (upon him).<br><br><i>There are four types of death penalty that may be given by a Jewish Court, stoning, strangulation, burning, and death by sword. Stoning is the most severe type of death penalty and is the only type of death penalty which involves blood exiting from many places of the body. This is why the language </i><b>דמיהם בם</b><i> in plural indicates death by stoning<sup class="footnote-marker">731</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Kedoshim 103.</i>.</i>

Klal 539

And there is a difference between <b>רגם אותו</b> and <b>רגם בו</b> (stone him), in that <b>רגם בו</b> teaches the way of vengeance and hatred. And we only find this language with respect to a person who “blesses” God<sup class="footnote-marker">732</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 24:16.</i>.

Klal 540

And it is the way of the Scripture to say מות יומת (he shall surely be put to death) before it specifies the type of death penalty, like מות יומת..עם הארץ ירגמוהו (he shall surely be put to death…the people of the land shall stone him)<sup class="footnote-marker">733</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 20:2.</i>. And with respect to a daughter of a priest who commits harlotry, it simply says באש תשרף (she shall be burnt with fire)<sup class="footnote-marker">734</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 21:9.</i>, because it is not necessary to say she is liable to the death penalty, as a female Israelite would also be liable to the death penalty; it only needs to explain the manner in which she should die.

Klal 541

One who is pregnant is never called a <b>נערה</b> (girl).
And if she is an adult who was damaged by a piece of wood, there is a disagreement among the sages as to whether she can be called a <b>בתולה</b> (virgin).

Klal 542

There is a difference between <b>מלאכה</b> and <b>עבודה</b> (work) – any work that a man occupies himself with to do for a special purpose is called <b>מלאכה</b>. And when there is an extra effort and toiling, it is called <b>עבודה</b>. And it is usually agriculture (or that which has a similar level of toiling) or work that is usually done through servants.
And on the Sabbath and the Day of Atonement, <b>מלאכה</b> is prohibited. And on holidays,מלאכת אוכל נפש (work for the purpose of eating) is permitted, and only מלאכת עבודה (servile work) is prohibited. And there is ordinary <b>מלאכה</b> (work) and <b>מלאכת מחשבת</b> (skillful work).

Klal 543

And in several places, it says regarding festivals, <b>כל מלאכת עבודה</b> לא תעשו (you shall do no manner of servile work), and when it says <b>כל מלאכה</b> לא תעשו (no manner of work shall be done in them)<sup class="footnote-marker">735</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 12:16.</i>, it needs to make an exception, אך אשר יאכל לכל נפש הוא לבדו יעשה לכם (save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you)<sup class="footnote-marker">736</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>. And only in Deuteronomy 16:8 does it say regarding festivals, לא תעשה מלאכה (you shall do no work) – however, there it is precise and it does not say לא תעשה <b>כל מלאכה</b> (you shall not do any manner of work) (as is always written regarding Sabbath), only מלאכה (manner of work). It means to say there are manners of work that are prohibited, for example those that are not done for the need of eating.
And there is a reason why it changes the noun and says מלאכה, and this is to give the difference between festivals and the weekdays of the festival. ביום השביעי עצרת לא תעשה מלאכה (in the seventh day is a holy convocation; you shall do no manner of servile work)<sup class="footnote-marker">737</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 23:8.</i> - it means to say even light work that is not done for the sake of eating. And during the weekdays of a festival light work is completely permitted, and also servile work is only partially prohibited.

Klal 544

And this is the reason why the seventh day of Passover and the eighth day of the Feast of Tabernacles are called <b>עצרת</b> and not the first day of Passover, the Feast of Tabernacles, and the Feast of Weeks: The last days of the festival are called עצרת, since during the weekdays of the festival before them, some creative activity is also prohibited, while on <i>Yom Tov</i> one needs to עצר (halt) from all creative activity.<br><br><i>The holiday of Passover has seven days. On the first day, all creative activity is prohibited. And then from the second day to the sixth day, called Chol HaMoed, only some creative activity is prohibited. Finally, on the seventh day, all creative activity is prohibited. This is called </i>עצרת.<br><br><i>Similarly, the Feast of Tabernacles has eight days. On the first day, all creative activity is prohibited. And then from the second day to the seventh day, called Chol HaMoed, only some creative activity is prohibited. Finally, on the eighth day, all creative activity is prohibited. This too is called </i>עצרת.

Klal 545

The noun <b>חג</b> (holiday) is used for the holiday offerings that were sacrificed in the days of the appointed times; it means to say שלמי שמחה (peace-offerings of joy). Thus, New Year’s Day and the Day of Atonement are not called by the name חג anywhere.<br><br><i>On New Year’s Day and the Day of Atonement, God did not command the Israelites to bring up peace-offerings of joy, only on Passover, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles. Therefore, the word </i>חג<i> does not pertain to New Year’s Day or the Day of Atonement.</i>

Klal 546

And the noun <b>שבת</b> (Sabbath) refers to the stopping of creative activity, and also can refer to <i>Yom Tov</i> (holiday). And the linguists, whose ways are to designate names for every matter, indicate the appointed times with the name חג or מועד (holiday) or with particular names -פסח, שבועות, סוכות (Passover, Feast of Weeks, Feast of Tabernacles). And one is unable to indicate the day after the first of Passover with the name מחרת החג או המועד (the day after the holiday or the appointed time), since this falls out during the seven days of the holiday, or with the name מחרת הפסח since this always means <i>מחרת שחיטת הפסח</i> (the day after the Passover offering) that is on the 15th of <i>Nissan</i>. Thus, the Torah is forced to indicate it with the nameמחרת השבת (the day after the Sabbath)<sup class="footnote-marker">738</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 23:15.</i>.
And we also find שבת to refer to a week.<br><br><i>Leviticus 23:15 says </i>וספרתם לכם ממחרת השבת מיום הביאכם את עמר התנופה שבע שבתות תמימת תהיינה<i> (And you shall count to you from the morrow after the day of rest, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the waving; seven weeks shall there be complete), using the language </i>ממחרת השבת<i> for “the morrow after the day of rest” and using the word </i>שבתות<i> for “weeks”.</i>

Klal 547

There is a difference between <b>כרת</b> (cut off) and <b>אבדון</b> (lost): That which is <b>אבדון</b> (lost) is only a change in place. This is not so for <b>כרת</b>.

Klal 548

<b>נותק</b> and <b>כורת</b> (detached/cut off) - <b>כורת</b> can also mean partially cut off. <b>נותק</b> is when something is completely cut off.

Klal 549

Ordinary <b>שמן</b> (oil) means olive oil. And when it is written with respect to the <i>Menorah</i>, שמן זית (olive oil)<sup class="footnote-marker">739</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 24:2.</i>, there is a homiletical interpretation.
And ordinary שמן that is mentioned with respect to thanksgiving offerings<sup class="footnote-marker">740</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:12.</i> is a <i>log</i> (a Biblical measure of liquid volume).<br><br><i>When the Torah says </i>שמן זית<i> (olive oil) with respect to the Menorah, the word </i>זית<i> (olive) is superfluous, since according to Rule 549, even if the Torah only had said </i>שמן<i>, it would still mean olive oil. The homiletical interpretation is that the extra word </i>זית<i> is there to indicate that the olives should be so ripe that oil drips from them while they are still attached to the tree<sup class="footnote-marker">741</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Emor 210.</i>.</i>

Klal 550

When it is written מכה נפש בהמה <b>ישלמנה</b> (And he that smites a beast mortally shall make it good)<sup class="footnote-marker">742</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 24:18.</i>, it is in a peculiar language, because the verb שלם (pay) should not have a pronoun referring to the thing which causes the obligation of payment. And the sages of blessed memory give a homiletical interpretation.<br><br><i>The pronoun of the word </i><b>ישלמנה</b><i> refers to the thing which causes the obligation of payment, namely the beast that one smites mortally. The homiletical interpretation is that the word <b>ישלמנה</b> should be interpreted as meaning “make it good”, meaning that the one who smites the beast mortally shall compensate the owner of the beast whatever he owes<sup class="footnote-marker">743</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Emor 247.</i>.</i>

Klal 551

The verb <b>גלח</b> (shave) in its precise meaning is with a razor. And in its broad meaning, it includes any type of shaving, even with scissors, only that it will be like a razor. If the roots of the hair remain, it will use the language <b>גזז</b> (cut). And the language<b>השחתת השער</b> (destroying the hair) also includes the roots of the hair, but not the language <b>גלוח</b>.

Klal 552

The words <b>גדד</b>and <b>שרט</b> (pick/scratch):
<b>שרט</b> is a light nick in his flesh and is done with the hand.
<b>גדד</b> is a deep slit that goes to the tendon and is done with an instrument.
<b>וכתובת קעקע</b> (tattoo): According to <i>Rashi</i>, the <b>כתובת</b> is with ink and the <b>קעקע</b> is with a needle. And according to Maimonides, the <b>כתובת</b> is the scratching and the <b>קעקע</b> is the filling with the ink.

Klal 553

The primary meaning of the noun <b>מדה</b> (measurement) is about the measurement of a quantity of anything physical. And with respect to the measurement of a vessel, it comes with a query: from measuring its length, width, and height, how much will the vessel hold?
<b>כול</b> (comprehend) - And the main idea of this special verb is about measuring everything וכל בשליש עפר הארץ (and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure)<sup class="footnote-marker">744</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 40:12.</i>.
<b>מדה</b> (measure) – its main idea is measuring the ground.
<b>משקל</b> (weight) – it is through a balance or a scale and weight stones.
<b>משורה</b> (measuring cup) – there are in it several ideas.
<b>איפה</b> (ancient measure of volume) is a measurement of solids, and <b>הין</b> (liquid unit) is a measurement of liquids.
And there is a difference between <b>אבן שלמה</b> (perfect weight) and <b>אבן צדק</b> (just weight). <b>אבן צדק</b> is with respect to the meting out of justice.

Klal 554

There is a difference between <b>גאל</b> and <b>פדה</b> (redeem): The concept of <b>גאל</b> is associated with a concept of closeness.
And the noun <b>אחוזה</b> (possession) is only found with respect to land.

Klal 555

There is a difference between <b>חִזק</b> (strengthen) in active voice intensive conjugation and <b>מחזיק</b> (grab) in active voice causative conjugation: <b>חִזק</b> in active voice intensive conjugation indicates that he gives strength to the weak; And with active voice causative conjugation, it teaches that he grabs onto his friend with strength. And if the prefix letter ב is after it, it teaches that he grabs on without letting go.

Klal 556

There is a difference between <b>גשם</b> and <b>מטר</b> (rain): <b>גשם</b> is natural in that it comes from the steam that evaporates from the land, while <b>מטר</b> is from Divine Providence, which comes from Heaven.

Klal 557

And there is a difference between <b>חלופין</b> and <b>תמורה</b> (exchange): <b>חלופין</b> is in the sense of the object – that this object passes and another object comes in its place. And <b>תמורה</b> is in the sense of the person, and it comes also about one’s sense of being - כבודם בקלון אמיר (I will change their glory into shame)<sup class="footnote-marker">745</sup><i class="footnote">Hosea 4:7.</i>.

Klal 558

And there is a difference between <b>כוס</b> and <b>חלק</b> (portion/inheritance)<sup class="footnote-marker">746</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 16:5.</i>: <b>כוס</b> is the portion that was ready long ago, and from this comes the noun <b>מכסת</b> (worth)<sup class="footnote-marker">747</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 27:23.</i>.
And the language <b>נפילה בחרב</b> (fall by the sword) comes with the prefix ב. And when it is written ונפלו לחרב (and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword)<sup class="footnote-marker">748</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 26:8.</i>, it means the enemies shall fall before you by their own swords.
And the verb <b>לא שמע</b> (not listen) in which the word אל comes afterwards teaches that he does not believe or accept his words. And <b>לא שמע לו</b> teaches that he believes him, but nevertheless refuses to listen.

Klal 559

<b>מחשבה</b> (thought) as a passive voice verb teaches that the thoughts are peculiar and not typical. And an example of this is when it is written המקריב אותו לא יחשב (neither shall it be imputed to him that offers it)<sup class="footnote-marker">749</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 7:18.</i>; it is impossible to interpret it as <i>לא יחשב לו לזכות</i>(neither shall it be imputed to him for a merit), since if it is to be interpreted in this way, the merit would have to be next to <i>לא יחשב לו</i>, as it is with ויחשבה לו צדקה (and He counted it to him for righteousness)<sup class="footnote-marker">750</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 15:6.</i>.

Klal 560

It is not the custom of the language to ascribe רפואה (healing) to the wound, but to a human being who is being healed. And when ascribing רפואה to the wound, it means that the person is not yet healed, only that the wound is gone. And when it is written נרפא נגע הצרעת מן הצרוע (if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper)<sup class="footnote-marker">751</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 14:3.</i>, there is no example of this found in the rest of the Scripture – and there is a homiletical interpretation.

Klal 561

And it is not the custom of the language to say that a man is <i>תחת המכסה</i> (under the covering). It should say, <i>המכסה הוא על האדם</i> (the covering is on the man); as it is proper to say that the secondary is on the primary, not that the primary is under the secondary. And from this, it is proven that when it is written הנוגע בכל אשר יהיה תחתיו (And whosoever touches any thing that was under him)<sup class="footnote-marker">752</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 15:10.</i>, it is referring to the saddle.
And moreover when it is written נגע צרעת כי תהיה באדם (When the plague of leprosy is in a man)<sup class="footnote-marker">753</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:9.</i>, it was proper to say אדם כי יהיה בו נגע צרעת, and there is a homiletical interpretation.
And it is typical for the language to say יצא לחפשי (he shall go out free)<sup class="footnote-marker">754</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 21:2.</i> or לחפשי ישלחנו (he shall let him go free)<sup class="footnote-marker">755</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 21:26.</i>. And the language <b>חופשה</b> לא ניתן לה (nor was freedom given to her)<sup class="footnote-marker">756</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 19:20.</i>, is talking about a bill of release.<br><br><i>According to the sages of blessed memory, the reason why Leviticus 13:9 says</i>נגע צרעת כי תהיה באדם<i> (When the plague of leprosy in a man) instead of אדם כי יהיה בו נגע צרעת is to teach that the law applies even when the plague is all over a man<sup class="footnote-marker">757</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Tazria 70.</i>.</i>

Klal 562

The word <b>שָם</b> (there) indicates only the place or the vessel in the sense that it is a place which holds something inside of it.

Klal 563

The word <b>אצל</b> (beside) always teaches about the close proximity of one thing to another thing.

Klal 564

The word <b>לעומת</b> (opposed to) is different than the rest of its synonyms in that it indicates one position that is limited against another position.
Not so with the language <b>נגד</b> (against), as it does not indicate something that is limited against a narrow position, only against a general space.
And the word <b>מול</b> (facing) indicates the area adjacent to something, something that is close to it and “sees” it.<br><br><i>Exodus 25:27 says, </i>לעמת המסגרת תהיין הטבעת לבתים לבדים לשאת את השלחן<i> (Close by the border shall the rings be, for places for the staves to bear the table), using the word לעומת for “close by”.</i><br><br><i>Genesis 31:37 says, </i>כי מששת את כל כלי מה מצאת מכל כלי ביתך שים כה נגד אחי ואחיך ויוכיחו בין שנינו<i> (Whereas you have felt about all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my brethren and your brethren, that they may judge betwixt us two), using the word נגד for “before”.</i><br><br><i>Leviticus 5:8 says, </i>והביא אתם אל הכהן והקריב את אשר לחטאת ראשונה ומלק את ראשו ממול ערפו ולא יבדיל<i> (And he shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin-offering first, and pinch off its head close by its neck, but shall not divide it asunder), using the word ממול for “close by”.</i>

Klal 565

The word <b>והנה</b> (and behold) always teaches that it is a new matter.<br><br><i>An example of והנה is Leviticus 13:5, which saysוראהו הכהן ביום השביעי והנה הנגע עמד בעיניו לא פשה הנגע בעור והסגירו הכהן שבעת ימים שנית (And the priest shall look on him the seventh day; and, behold, if the plague stay in its appearance, and the plague be not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days more).</i>

Klal 566

The word <b>עוד</b> (more) implies that it was already so in the beginning.
And there is a difference between <b>עוד</b> and <b>שנית</b> (more): In a place where it is not precise about the number or about the things which are counted, it will use the word עוד. But in a place where it is precise, it will use the word שנית.

Klal 567

The word <b>עד</b> (until) will sometimes mean<i>עד ועד בכלל</i> (up to and including) and sometimes mean <i>not including</i>. But in a place where it indicates two boundaries - <b>מן...עד</b> (from…until) – it means <i>including</i> the two boundaries. And there is a disagreement about this in the <i>Gemara<sup class="footnote-marker">758</sup><i class="footnote">Babylonian Talmud Arakhin 18a.</i></i>.

Klal 568

There is a difference between the demonstrative pronouns <b>הזה</b> (this) and <b>ההוא</b> (that): The pronoun ההוא indicates that something is distant and not before us, while the pronoun הזה indicates that it is close and before us.
And any place where the pronoun הזה comes in which it is not close, the sages of blessed memory will give a homiletical interpretation that either it was close or that הזה is there to restrict. And moreover, they do this with the pronouns<b>זאת</b> (this) and <b>אלה</b>(these).

Klal 569

And in any place where it says <b>זאת תורת</b> (this Teaching), it will introduce many things under a general teaching or a general statute, and it means to say that it is teaching generalities, not particulars.
1) That is, it will include many judgements and laws within it.
2) Or that a particular judgement is applicable to many things.
3) Or both of these.
And the sages of blessed memory will always clarify and explain it in this way.

Klal 570

Any place where an imperative expression begins with the word <b>זה</b> (this), it is proper for the imperative verb to come without the word <b>אשר</b>. Like זה תאכלו..וזה לא תאכלו (This you may eat…And this you may not eat). And if the word אשר does come, like זאת החיה אשר תאכלו (these are the living things which you may eat)<sup class="footnote-marker">759</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 11:2.</i>, it teaches that the imperative already preceded it in a general way, and it is coming to clarify the imperative.

Klal 571

There is a difference between <b>אחר</b> and <b>אחרי</b> (after): The word <b>אחר</b> teaches the consecutiveness of the matter after a matter preceding it, while the word <b>אחרי</b> teaches that preceding it were various matters and many times.
And there is a difference between <b>אחר</b> and <b>אחר כן</b> and <b>אחרי כן</b>:
The word <b>אחר</b> means <i>after one matter</i>.
The word <b>אחר כן</b> is after many matters which were mentioned in a topic and pertain to the matter.
The word <b>אחרי כן</b> teaches after many matters which were not mentioned in a topic and do not pertain to that matter.

Klal 572

The words <b>אחר</b> and <b>אחרים</b> (other) always indicate that there is no relationship between the previous and that it is distinguished from it - like אלקים אחרים (other gods) or איש אחר (another man).

Klal 573

The word<b>על</b>
can be used with the meaning of the word <i>עם</i> (with),
with the meaning of the word <i>אצל</i> (at),
with the meaning of the word “because”,
with the meaning of the word <i>אחר</i> (another) or <i>מלבד</i> (apart from),
and with the meaning of the word <i>אל</i> (to).
And there will always be a homiletical interpretation.

Klal 574

And there is a disagreement as to whether <b>על</b> (upon) can mean <i>nearby</i> or not.
And sometimes it clarifies that it means <i>literally</i> through repeating the word <b>עליו</b> or through this word coming with a cantillation note, since most of the time it comes with a hyphen.
And sometimes the word עליו is superfluous, and it comes to be precise that it means <i>intentionally</i> or to exclude something else.

Klal 575

And there is a difference between the word <b>על</b> (when its context indicates that it means <i>apart from</i>) and <b>מלבד</b> (apart from): The noun that is after the wordעל is usually the first or the primary, while the noun after the word מלבד is secondary.

Klal 576

And there is a distinction with respect the word <b>מלבד</b> (apart from):
If a verb comes on a secondary matter that is mentioned right after the word מלבד – then if it is a past tense verb, the secondary matter was done before the primary matter.
And if it is a future tense verb, the secondary matter is to be done after the primary matter.
And if a verb comes on a primary matter, it will be the same situation in reverse.<br><br><i>Genesis 26:1 says,ויהי רעב בארץ מלבד הרעב הראשון אשר היה בימי אברהם (And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham). In this verse, the secondary matter is the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. Since the verb היה (that was) is in past tense, the secondary matter happened before the primary matter, in accordance with Rule 576.</i>

Klal 577

There is a difference between the language <b>מלבד הרעב הראשון</b> (beside the first famine)<sup class="footnote-marker">760</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 26:1.</i> and the language <b>לבד מערי הפרזי</b> (beside the unwalled towns)<sup class="footnote-marker">761</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 3:5.</i>: Any place where it is possible to err and think that a matter is included in a statement, but it means to say that it is not included in the statement – it will say <b>לבד מן</b>. But in a place where it is impossible to err and think that a matter is included a statement and it only intends to inform that it is מלבד (in addition to), which says that it was more of a particular matter – it will say the word מלבד.<br><br><i>Genesis 26:1 says,</i>ויהי רעב בארץ מלבד הרעב הראשון אשר היה בימי אברהם וילך יצחק אל אבימלך מלך פלשתים גררה<i> (And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar), using the word <b>מלבד</b> (beside) to inform that the famine in the land in the days of Isaac was in addition to the first famine that was in the days of Abraham.</i><br><br><i>Deuteronomy 3:5 says, </i>כל אלה ערים בצרות חומה גבהה דלתים ובריח לבד מערי הפרזי הרבה מאד<i> (All these were fortified cities, with high walls, gates, and bars; beside the unwalled towns a great many), using the word <b>לבד</b> (beside) to say that one should not err and think the Torah is including the unwalled towns<sup class="footnote-marker">762</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Emor 190.</i>.</i>

Klal 578

There is a difference between <b>והלאה</b> (and thenceforth) and <b>ומעלה</b> (and upward): When it says ומעלה, it does not include that day. And when it says והלאה – it means also including that day.<br><br><i>The Malbim is referring to the following:</i><br><br><i>Leviticus 22:27 says,</i>שור או כשב או עז כי יולד והיה שבעת ימים תחת אמו ומיום השמיני והלאה ירצה לקרבן אשה ליהוה<i> (When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; but from the eighth day and thenceforth it may be accepted for an offering made by fire to the LORD), and uses the word </i>והלאה<i> (and thenceforth), so it includes the eighth day.</i><br><br><i>Also Leviticus 27:7 says, </i>ואם מבן ששים שנה ומעלה אם זכר והיה ערכך חמשה עשר שקל ולנקבה עשרה שקלים<i> (And if it be from sixty years old and upward: if it be a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels), and uses the word </i>ומעלה<i> (and upward), so it does not include the sixtieth year.</i>

Klal 579

The words <b>אתו</b> and <b>עמו</b> (with him/it) each mean that what is taught to be found in one matter can also be found in the second matter; however, there is a slight difference between them: The word עמו teaches that both matters are alike and combined. But the word אתו joins also with the word את which teaches about the direct object, and teaches that one acts upon the other and that the second is acted upon from it and is secondary to it.

Klal 580

When the word <b>כל</b> comes in a sentence which obligates, it will obligate all. And when the sentence prohibits, it will prohibit all. And the “all” will come in one of two ways:
If it is a category or type that is obligated or prohibited, it will be for all members of the type or category.
If it is an individual that is obligated or prohibited, it will be for all parts of that individual.
And the sages always interpreted the word כל to be an amplificatory expression.

Klal 581

And when it says <b>כל אלה</b> (all of these), there is a distinction: If the word אלה tends to some – the wordכל will mean <i>all</i>. And if the word אלה teaches about all of it, כל will mean <i>any</i>.
And moreover, the word כל that comes with a noun: If the meaning of the noun is about all – the word כל that comes with it will mean <i>any</i>. And if the meaning of the noun is about some – the word כל will mean <i>all</i>.<br><br><i>Leviticus 18:24 says, אל תטמאו בכל אלה כי בכל אלה נטמאו הגוים אשר אני משלח מפניכם (Defile not you yourselves in any of these things; for in all these the nations are defiled, which I cast out from before you). The first time the words בכל אלה (in any of these) come, the אלה teaches about all, so the כל means “any”, in accordance with Rule 581<sup class="footnote-marker">763</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Acharei Mot 147.</i>.</i>

Rule 582 is referring to the question as to whether this verse means each and every member of the Sanhedrin errs in judgement or only the majority of the Sanhedrin errs in judgement.</i>

The word <b>כל</b> (all/each) never refers to a number less than three.

For all words and chapters that are connected with the connecting prefix ו, there will be a certain connection between one and the other - even in a chapter that begins with the word כי. And all the more so, the conditional divisions that are indicated with the word אם (as was written above in Chapter 11). And with this, they say that<i>וי"ו מוסיף על ענין ראשון</i> (the וadds something to the first topic).
And sometimes it will connect the topics that are at the beginning of a chapter through the letter ו in order to compare them with one another.

Klal 586

And moreover, any place where the prefix ו is written in the middle of a chapter, it is for topics which are connected and relevant to one another.

Klal 587

And the word <b>או</b> (or) teaches about the disjunction, while the word <b>יחדיו</b> (together) teaches about the conjunction.
And the letter<b>ו</b> sometimes means “and” and sometimes means “or”. And Rabbi Isaiah and Rabbi Yonasan disagree about מכה אביו ואמו (And he that smites his father, or his mother shall surely be put to death)<sup class="footnote-marker">765</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 21:15.</i>. And I explained the matter at length that with a simple imperative, everyone agrees that the<b>ו</b> means “and”, and with a simple warning, everyone agrees that the<b>ו</b> means “or”. And they only disagree about conditional statements like מכה אביו ואמו.

Klal 588

And any place where it is known from the context that the letter ו means “or” – it is proper for it to be written with the letter ו. And whenever the wordאו is written, it is superfluous and there will always be a homiletical interpretation.

Klal 589

The grammarians write that there is an instance of the word <b>או</b> (or) where it means <i>אם</i> (if). And this opinion is not in agreement with the opinion of the sages of blessed memory, in which every word has a special meaning on its own. And they interpret it to mean “or if”.
And moreover, when it is written או כי ישוב הבשר החי (But if the raw flesh again be turned into white)<sup class="footnote-marker">766</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:16.</i>, Rabbi Avraham ibn Ezra and the commentators are challenged – the sages of blessed memory explain that it comes to inform that it is not an absolute condition but only a possibility and that they mean to say <i>anytime</i> it is turned into white; this is the meaning of the word או, that it comes to inform of a division or a possibility.<br><br><i>Leviticus 13:12-17 says, </i>ואם פרוח תפרח הצרעת בעור וכסתה הצרעת את כל עור הנגע מראשו ועד רגליו לכל מראה עיני הכהן. וראה הכהן והנה כסתה הצרעת את כל בשרו וטהר את הנגע כלו הפך לבן טהור הוא. וביום הראות בו בשר חי יטמא. וראה הכהן את הבשר החי וטמאו הבשר החי טמא הוא צרעת הוא. או כי ישוב הבשר החי ונהפך ללבן ובא אל הכהן. וראהו הכהן והנה נהפך הנגע ללבן וטהר הכהן את הנגע טהור הוא.<i> (<b>And if</b> the leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that has the plague from his head even to his feet, as far as appears to the priest; then the priest shall look; and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that has the plague; it is all turned white: he is clean. But whensoever raw flesh appears in him, he shall be unclean.

Klal 590

The scope of the word <b>גם</b> (also) is to add in any place. And thus, the sages say whenever the word <b>גם</b> comes repeated, they come to amplify.
The word <b>אף</b> (even) always teaches about a matter that is a novelty relative to the preceding matter.

Klal 591

The word <b>אך</b> indicates a limitation in the second sentence; it means to say in the sentence where the word אך comes. And nevertheless, it is different than the word <b>רק</b>, which excludes a matter from the previous sentence.<br><br><i>Deuteronomy 12:15-16 says,</i>רק בכל אות נפשך תזבח ואכלת בשר כברכת יהוה אלהיך אשר נתן לך בכל שעריך הטמא והטהור יאכלנו כצבי וכאיל. רק הדם לא תאכלו על הארץ תשפכנו כמים<i> (Notwithstanding you may kill and eat flesh within all your gates, after all the desire of your soul, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which He has given you; the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the gazelle, and as of the hart. Only you shall not eat the blood), using the word </i>רק<i> to mean “only”. Here, blood is excluded from the previous sentence as being permissible to eat.</i><br><br><i>Leviticus 11:3-4 says,</i>כל מפרסת פרסה ושסעת שסע פרסת מעלת גרה בבהמה אתה תאכלו. אך את זה לא תאכלו ממעלי הגרה וממפריסי הפרסה את הגמל כי מעלה גרה הוא ופרסה איננו מפריס טמא הוא לכם<i> (Whatsoever parts the hoof, and is wholly cloven-footed, and chews the cud, among the beasts, that may you eat. Nevertheless these shall you not eat of them that only chew the cud, or of them that only part the hoof: the camel, because he chews the cud but parts not the hoof, he is unclean to you), using the word </i>אך<i> to mean “nevertheless”, which is used to teach that one cannot eat of any type of animal which does not satisfy all of the criteria listed in the first sentence. The camel does not satisfy all of these criteria, since it does not have split hooves, even though it chews its cud<sup class="footnote-marker">768</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Shemini 68.</i>.</i>

A warning about the consequence of an action is sometimes indicated with the word <b>פן</b> (lest) (ולא תגעו בו פן תמותון - neither shall you touch it, lest you die<sup class="footnote-marker">769</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 3:3.</i>) and sometimes with the word <b>לא</b> – (ושמרתם..ולא יהיה קצת). And after investigation, one finds that the word פן is usually correct with a warning not to do something, while the word לא comes with a warning that one is obligated to do something. And if the consequence of the action obligates on its own – it will use the word לא. And if it does not obligate on its own, it will use the word פן.<br><br><i>An example of the consequence of an action obligating on its own is if one is about to die and he is given a way to avoid death by performing a certain action. Then it will use the word </i>לא.<br><br><i>And an example of the consequence of an action not obligating on its own is if one does not do as he is commanded, he will die.

Klal 593

The word <b>לכם</b> (to/for you, plural) teaches about the benefit (as mentioned in Rule 459) or about the need for an item. Or it comes to exclude others.<br><br><i>Leviticus 11:8 says,</i>מבשרם לא תאכלו ובנבלתם לא תגעו טמאים הם לכם <i>(Of their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch; they are unclean to you), using the word </i>לכם<i> for “to you”. According to Sifra, this implies that they are permitted for benefit.</i><br><br><i>Leviticus 11:38 says,</i>וכי יתן מים על זרע ונפל מנבלתם עליו טמא הוא לכם <i>(But if water be put upon the seed, and aught of their carcass fall thereon, it is unclean to you), using the word </i>לכם<i> for “to you”. According to Sifra, this implies that anything that is for one’s needs will be unclean.</i><br><br><i>Leviticus 25:6 says,</i>והיתה שבת הארץ לכם לאכלה לך <i>(And the sabbath-produce of the land shall be for food for you) using the word </i>לך<i> for “for you”. According to Sifra, this implies “but not for others”.</i>

Klal 594

When reflexive verbs come with the word [ <b>לו , לך , לכם , להם</b> ], it teaches that the action will be toward itself and not toward another.<br><br><i>Leviticus 15:13 says,וכי יטהר הזב מזובו וספר לו שבעת ימים לטהרתו וכבס בגדיו ורחץ בשרו במים חיים וטהר (And when he that has an issue is cleansed of his issue, then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes; and he shall bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean).

Klal 595

In order to say “with them”, the Torah says <b>בם</b> or <b>בהם</b> (in/with them). And the word בהם denotes more than the word בם, as it teaches that it is to be disseminated throughout.

Klal 596

The word <b>והיה</b> (and it shall be) that comes in a conditional statement about the future usually connects the latter expression to the previous expression, in particular through cause and effect. And in a place where it does not come in this way, the sages of blessed memory explain that it teaches about the frequency, that it is to be done immediately.

Klal 597

The prefix letter ל that is after the word והיה in a place that does not indicate the changing of one thing to another teaches that it has been established to such and such matter.<br><br><i>Leviticus 13:2 says,</i>אדם כי יהיה בעור בשרו שאת או ספחת או בהרת והיה בעור בשרו לנגע צרעת והובא אל אהרן הכהן או אל אחד מבניו הכהנים<i> (When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, or a scab, or a bright spot, and it become in the skin of his flesh the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons the priests), using the word והיה for “and it become” and the word לנגע for “the plague”. This means that the plague of leprosy has been established to be in the skin of his flesh, in accordance with Rule 597<sup class="footnote-marker">772</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Tazria 41.</i>.</i>

Klal 598

The word <b>ויהי</b> (and there was) teaches that whatever action that was written was done.<br><br><i>Genesis 1:3 says, ויאמר אלהים יהי אור ויהי אור (And God said: 'Let there be light.' And there was light), using the word ויהי to teach that God’s action of creating light was done.</i>

Klal 599

The pronoun<b>ההוא</b> (that) always comes to makes things precise. And it is interpreted that one’s sin cannnot be unwilling, unintentional, or mistaken; or it comes to limit.<br><br><i>When Leviticus 7:20 says,</i>והנפש אשר תאכל בשר מזבח השלמים אשר ליהוה וטמאתו עליו ונכרתה הנפש ההוא מעמיה<i> (But the soul that eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, that pertain to the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his people), it uses the language </i>הנפש ההוא<i> (that soul).

The conjunction letter <b>ו</b> – it is the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ben Meir Ibn Ezra and the <i>Radak</i> that it is like the prefix letter <b>ف</b> (pronounced <i>fe)</i> in Arabic (which can mean “and” or “so” or “then”). And the opinion of the <i>Radak</i>’s father in the book <i>Sefer HaGilui</i> is that it alludes to a missing word.

And there is an instance in the Scripture in which the prefix <b>ו</b> clarifies.
And there is an instance in the Scripture in which the prefix <b>ו</b> compares - ומחית בשר חי (and there be quick raw flesh in the rising)<sup class="footnote-marker">778</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:10.</i>.
And there is an instance in the Scripture in which the prefix <b>ו</b> is missing.<br><br><i>Leviticus 10:8-9 says,</i>וידבר יהוה אל אהרן לאמר יין ושכר אל תשת אתה ובניך אתך בבאכם אל אהל מועד ולא תמתו חקת עולם לדרתיכם<i> (And the LORD spoke to Aaron, saying: Drink no wine nor strong drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the tent of meeting, that you die not; it shall be a statute forever throughout your generation), using the words </i>יין ושכר אל תשת<i> for “Drink no wine nor strong drink”. The prefix </i>ו<i> clarifies that they should not drink wine as one drinks a strong drink, by way of intoxication.</i><br><br><i>Leviticus 13:10 says, </i>וראה הכהן והנה שאת לבנה בעור והיא הפכה שער לבן ומחית בשר חי בשאת<i> (And the priest shall look, and, behold, if there be a white rising in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising), where it uses the language </i>הפכה שער לבן<i>for “turned the hair white” and the prefix ו comes on ומחית בשר חי (and there be quick raw flesh in the rising). In this case, the prefix </i>ו<i> compares – just as “turned the hair white” implies enough space for at least two hairs, so too “quick raw flesh in the rising” implies enough space for at least two hairs.</i><br><br><i>Leviticus 6:13 says,</i>זה קרבן אהרן ובניו אשר יקריבו ליהוה ביום המשח אתו עשירת האפה סלת מנחה תמיד מחציתה בבקר ומחציתה בערב <i>(This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to the LORD in the day when he is anointed: the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half thereof in the evening), using the words מנחה תמיד for “a meal-offering perpetually”. However, it is interpreted as </i>ומנחה תמיד<i>; the prefix </i>ו<i> is missing.</i>

Klal 605

There is a difference between the prefix <b>ל</b> and the the word <b>על</b>: The ל teaches division, while the word על teaches combination. עגלה על שני הנשיאים ושור לאחד (a wagon for every two of the princes and for each one an ox)<sup class="footnote-marker">779</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 7:3.</i>.<br><br><i>Numbers 7:3 says,</i>ויביאו את קרבנם לפני יהוה שש עגלת צב ושני עשר בקר עגלה על שני הנשאים ושור לאחד ויקריבו אותם לפני המשכן<i> (And they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen: a wagon for every two of the princes, and for each one an ox; and they presented them before the tabernacle). The word על teaches that every two of the princes share a wagon (combination), while the prefix ל teaches that each prince gets one ox (division).</i>

Klal 606

There is a difference between <b>את</b> and the prefix <b>מ</b>, in that the מ teaches <i>part of</i> (as is mentioned above in Rule 355, Rule 364, and Rule 393).

Klal 607

According to the grammarians, the prefix letter ב can be found in place of the letter מ. But the sages of blessed memory disagree.
And when it is written ושרף את הבגד...בצמר (And he shall burn the garment…of wool)<sup class="footnote-marker">780</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:52.</i> they interpret the letter ב to mean <i>composed of</i>.

For the Torah will not switch one prefix letter for another prefix letter, according to the opinion of the sages.

Klal 608

And moreover, there is an instance in the Scripture where the word <b>את</b> replaces <b>עם</b> - ואת הנתק לא יגלח (but the scall shall he not shave)<sup class="footnote-marker">782</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:33.</i>. And according to the sages of blessed memory, there is also a teaching with respect to the word את.<br><br><i>The words</i>ואת הנתק <i>actually mean “around the scall”, since it could not possibly mean “the scall”, where there is no hair<sup class="footnote-marker">783</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Tazria 133.</i>.</i>

Klal 609

There is a difference between <b>לא</b> and <b>אין</b> (not): The word לא negates the action, while the word איננו negates the modifier from the modified.
Therefore, there is a difference between ושערה לא הפך לבן (and the hair thereof be not turned white)<sup class="footnote-marker">784</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:4.</i> and ושער לבן אין בו (behold, there be no white hairs therein)<sup class="footnote-marker">785</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 13:21.</i>: אין בו means it is not found at all, while לא הפך negates the action alone; there is hair, only that it does not turn white.

Klal 610

And the <i>Radak</i> already wrote that the word לא falls on an individual man, while the word אין falls on man in general. However, we do find the word אין also on an individual man - אין יוסף בבור (Joseph was not in the pit)<sup class="footnote-marker">786</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 37:29.</i> and אין האיש בביתו (For my husband is not at home)<sup class="footnote-marker">787</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 7:19.</i>. And we explained that there are two derivations associated with the word אין – one geminate אֵין and the other hollow אַיִן. And any place where the word אין comes on the negation of a particular matter, it is geminate.
And moreover, with a singular pronoun, it is איננּו איננּי, where the letter נ always has a diacritic dot. But with a plural pronoun, there is no diacritic dot, since it is hollow, and it negates the general.
(And the difference between the geminate word אֵין and the word לא is, as we wrote in the previous rule, that the word אין negates the subject of the expression, comes next to the subject, and is the opposite of יש, while the word לא negates the predicate.)
Nevertheless, the word אין that comes alone is usually hollow, and it negates the general.

Klal 611

And from the word <b>אין</b>, the word <b>מאן</b> (refuse) is derived, according to the sages of blessed memory, just as from the word <a dir="rtl"><b>הן</b></a>, <b>ותהינו</b> לעלות ההרה (and deemed it a light thing to go up into the hill-country)<sup class="footnote-marker">788</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 1:41.</i> is derived.
And there is a difference between <b>מאן</b> and <b>לא אבה</b> (refuse): מאן is oral and he says אין, while <b>לא אבה</b> is in the heart.

Klal 612

The word <b>את</b> that is used to indicate a direct object will usually be missing. And the sages of blessed memory give interpretations for the wordאת in the Scripture several times. And after investigation, I found that in several places where the direct object is known through for instance a definite article ה or a pronoun, and moreover in a place where the direct object is a noun – the word את will usually come. And in a place where the direct object is unknown – it usually will come without the word את, and when the word את does come, there will be a homiletical interpretation.
And moreover, in a place where the direct object is known but is missing the word את, there will be a homiletical interpretation. And it will always say יכבס בגדיו (he shall wash his clothes), except with a house which is afflicted, where it will say יכבס את בגדיו. This is because whenever one washes clothes, the clothes were not necessarily worn, only afflicted, so the pronoun in בגדיו is not precise; thus, it will be missing the word את. But a house that is afflicted only makes the clothes that were worn unclean, so the the pronoun will be precise; thus, it is written את.

Klal 613

And in a place where it is proper for the word את or any preposition to be but it is missing, there will be an explanation, as is desired. And thus, when it is written three times וסמך ידו (and he shall lay his hand) without the word את, the sages give three homiletical interpretations, as if it were written וסמך בידו. And the same applies for all situations like this.<br><br><i>There are three places in the Torah where it is written וסמך ידו without the word </i>את:<br><br><i>Leviticus 1:4 – </i>וסמך ידו על ראש העלה ונרצה לו לכפר עליו<i> (And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him).</i><br><br><i>Leviticus 3:2 – </i>וסמך ידו על ראש קרבנו ושחטו פתח אהל מועד וזרקו בני אהרן הכהנים את הדם על המזבח סביב<i> (And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tent of meeting; and Aaron's sons the priests shall dash the blood against the altar round about).</i><br><br><i>Leviticus 4:24 – </i>וסמך ידו על ראש השעיר ושחט אתו במקום אשר ישחט את העלה לפני יהוה חטאת הוא<i> (And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt-offering before the LORD; it is a sin-offering).</i><br><br><i>In each of these cases, it means to lay his own hand and to not do it through an intermediary<sup class="footnote-marker">789</sup><i class="footnote">Malbim, HaTorah v’HaMitzvah Vayikra 28.</i>.</i>
