Verse 1



Verse 2

Her term of service is over. Her time was over, like "Wait until this week is over", and bounds the term of service which is a limited and set amount of time
Expiated. Like "That it may be acceptable in his behalf, in expiation for him."
Double. There is a difference between "Double" (כפלים) and "Double portion" (פי שנים), "Double portion" the multiplication of the quantity makes a difference. But "Double" the quantities will be folded in half, from the idea of "and fold over the sixth cloth", and folded is the language of change, and here it wants to say that the amount of time has folded in half, and suffered the rate of anguish in half the amount of time, and because of this their punishments were folded and doubled, until all her sins were accounted for, double in everything, double in the value, and there is a Bet (ב) in בכל (for all) which means double the value, like the Bet in "Let him sell it to me, at the full price" (בכסף), and see what I wrote (Job 11:6)

Verse 3

In the desert, in the wilderness. I explained the difference (above) 35:1.
A road, a highway. (35:8) and between Lord and our God I explained the difference above and in the whole book.

Verse 4

"The rugged ground". Isolated, and it is from the topic of the ambush 'but the far end of it was on the west.' (Joshua 8:13), which fenced the circular road that surrounded the counterpart with deception or action with slyness, and thus the place they were at was called ridges, which are raised humps attached together (from 'The breastpiece shall be held in place' (Exodus 28:28)), until you have to go around and encircle the road, which is a place of rugged ground.

To Zion, to Jerusalem – Zion refers to the stronghold of Zion and represents the kingship, the Temple and the Sanhedrin. Jerusalem was the dwelling place of the masses and represents the gathering of the people and the like, as I wrote above.

Verse 1

“for your light has come” The commentators were astounded by this usage because they thought when speaking of the sunrise, the Hebrew language employs the terms ‘rising’ or ‘going out’ while ‘coming’ implies sunset in all cases. But they did not check this matter well, because this is true only in reference to the body of the sun, when the speaker describes it as coming out from its place beyond the eastern horizon and heading toward its destination at the western. Then its 'coming’ is the moment it reaches  its destination in the west. This is not so when speaking of the light, whose purpose is achieved when its rays touch that which is illuminated, then it has come to its place. “Your light” refers to the light which comes of itself, and the rising of the glory of Gd is the light of prophecy - they will shine upon you until they are as the light of the sun upon the moon, as I wrote elsewhere (see Isaiah 60:19). On this it says “…and kings by the brilliance of Your shine,” (Isaiah 60:3) because ‘shine’ refers to the light of the moon as I mentioned above (verses 13 and 14, and 19 below).
