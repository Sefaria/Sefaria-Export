Verse 20

<b>And God said, "Let the waters swarm":</b> The Creation went from one level to another, the inanimate, that which grows [plant life], that which is alive [animal life], and the speaking (human life). And everything that [came] first was a preparation for that which [came] after it. So after He arranged the luminaires, without which it would have been impossible for life to exist [as mentioned above on verse 14], He gave the word for the creation of animals. And it is known that even when they went up the ladder of stages, a creature did not climb [from what was before it] by jumps, but rather through stages. So it is found that coral is between the inanimate and that which grows; the polyp [sea anemones or zooids] is between that which grows and that which is alive; and monkeys [primates] are between that which is alive and the speaking. And likewise with each level, it arose from the lower to the higher, as I have written; such that with the creation of that which grows, it ascended from grasses to herbs, and from [herbs] to trees. And so was it with the creation of animals, such that scientists have divided animals into six groupings: 1) worms; 2) the hovering or crawling [insects]; 3) fish; 4) marine life that lives in the water and on land [amphibians]; 5) birds; and 6) mammals. And the first two groups are not mentioned in Scripture, since they are positioned between that which grows and that which is alive. As worms are close to that which grows, so [that] their reproduction is without male and female. The majority of the hovering are also born from vermin and crawl like worms, their skins change several times until they surround themselves in an envelope, turn into a winged hoverer, procreate and die. But they do not have blood, but a white liquid instead; [so] it is understood that it is the transition between that which grows and that which is alive. Hence the creation story begins with the four last groupings, such that He commanded that "the waters swarm [<i>yishretzu</i>] with swarms [<i>sheratzim</i>] of creatures." And Ramban explained [both] the noun and the verb as being about their running and their movement. But Rabbi Yitzchak Abarbanel explained it as about their procreation. And I have already explained in my book, HaTorah VeHamitzvah (Shemini, Sections 80 and 109), that the noun, <i>sheretz</i>, appears about the movement and the swarming, but the verb, <i>sharatz</i>, is usually used regarding the excessive reproduction that is found with swarming creatures, as I wrote there based on the reason of the sages, may their memory be blessed. And here [too], it appears with the understanding of excessive reproduction, such that the waters should produce animals that live and reproduce in the water. And that includes the grouping of the fish and the grouping of the water animals [amphibians]. For even though the water animals also go up on the dry land, most of them lay their eggs in the water. As those that reproduce on the land are not associated with the water animals concerning [their categorization for] impurity and purity, as I wrote there in the book, HaTorah VeHamitzvah. And birds are [also] to swarm, since they are positioned between these two groupings and the grouping of mammals. For they are [also] warm-blooded and have lungs, whereas the earlier ones are cold-blooded and do not have lungs, but a balloon-like sac instead. And hence the sages, may their memory be blessed, said that fish and grasshoppers do not require slaughter – for grasshoppers are below fish, since they are from the buzzing ones – whereas birds require slaughter of one [tube]. As they were created from the mud, meaning the blending of water, dirt and air. And hence it stated, <i>let the waters swarm</i> for their watery part; and <i>let them fly upon the earth</i>, for their earthly part; and <i>over the firmament of the skies,</i> for their airy part which is the one that is dominant with them.

<b>They heard the voice.</b> Before the sin they were able to communicate with Hashem directly, as Moshe did, without the assistance of the imagination. Therefore their prophecies were accompanied by no sensory perceptions, either audible or visual. That is why they experienced no fright, unlike later prophets. Now, however, their physical natures had become dominant and their prophecies were cloaked in more tangible garb.

HE NAMED HIM NOACH, SAYING "THIS ONE WILL CONSOLE US" - I have explained in my commentary on Isaiah that the sense of the verb N-CH-M is the change of attitude; this is consistent with the idea of consoling mourners, as the mourner’s attitude changes from grief to happiness; this is also consistent with the idea of regret, as it says here, this “one will make us regret” – from now on we will refrain from our useless activities that have no positive effect for the benefit of humankind, and thereby, we will also find rest from our evil and the land which is cursed as the result of our evil ways. Similarly, it is written in Haggai, “you have sown much and reaped little – be mindful of the way that you have been behaving” and as I explained there. By way of regretting ones evil ways, and resolving to change them, the curse will also be changed to a blessing and there will be relief, as in Isaiah 13, “on the day when God will relieve you from your sadness, your anger, and your toil.”

Chapter 6



Verse 1


<b>Daughters were born to them.</b> Where polygamy is the rule many more girls are born than boys.

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>His days shall be.</b> Hashem saw that their long life spans were not to their benefit because after years of struggle the body inevitably defeated the soul, dragging it down to its own level.

Verse 4

<b>The Nephilim</b>: Now we shall explain, that which is written, <i>And the sons of God/the gods saw the daughters of man</i> (Genesis 6:2). Who were the sons of God/the gods? These were the ones who said they were the sons of God/the gods and fell from heaven. And legends like these existed in those days and also afterward. For it is well-known that in all of the stories of the ancient nations, they told stories that the sons of the gods from heaven came to the earth and ruled over their country. They came and ruled over it and married the daughters of man, such that heroes, strong men, ministers, and rulers arose from these unions. This is, as the reader can find in the chronicles of the origin stories of Egypt, China, and Greece beginning from gods and demi-gods who walked upon the tall mountains and their lands in the early days. And they tell wonderous and heroic deeds about them, and they made them into idols by erecting monuments and altars for them and serving them with abominable rituals. For they told stories about their idols that included murder, sexual immorality, and all the bad traits, to the point that all their worshippers imitated them with their worship, such as the idol whose worship was with sexual immorality and the idol who they worshipped with human sacrifice. And these rituals continued until the middle of the Roman Empire. So all the more were they found in full swing in the days of Moses. And all the stories of the chronicles of Egypt began with the idols, the sons of the gods that fell from heaven to earth in the days of antiquity. Hence our teacher Moses, peace be upon him, informed us that these Nephilim, the giants and the tyrants that the nations said about, in their stories, that they fell from heaven, were around in those days and also afterward. As giants and terrible strong men existed then, who said about themselves that they were the sons of the gods that fell from heaven, and that is why they called them, Nephilim, since they fell [<i>naflu</i>] to earth. So people began to worship them, and this continued afterward. And these were the sons of the gods that had intercourse with the daughters of men and had children from them, such that the children were also considered idols, given that they believed that they were born from the sons of divine beings. However, you should know that all of the stories and legends upon which the idolatrous priests built up idolatry, and their stories about their idols and their mythology, are all falsehood and deception. Can a person make a god when they are not God [alluding to Jeremiah 16:20]? Rather, <i>they were the heroes of old, the men of renown</i>. As they would attribute divinity to any hero who arose in those days or to one who made a name for himself with his wisdom and his deeds, and they would say that he fell from heaven and would tell wondrous stories and much nonsense about him. And the source of all these stories began with the flood and onward. And that was the root of the corruption of man, the strange and foreign worship, and the false beliefs and nonsense, for which God saw fit to shorten the days of man, that they should see that they are people and mortal, and not gods. 


Verse 5

<b>Adonoy saw.</b> Hashem saw that even reducing their life spans to 120 years did not cause them to repent. This was because their sins were the result of ideology as well as appetite.

Verse 6



Verse 7



Verse 8

<b>But Noach found favor.</b> If Noach had remained among his contemporaries he too would have been corrupted. Thus Hashem destroyed the entire generation only to save him. If, on the other hand, there had been no righteous person the world would have been spared, for Hashem only performs cruel acts if they will produce a positive result.

Verse 3

Any creeping thing that lives will be for you to eat. For in the day of Adam, people's bodies were strong and the fruits had not yet been damaged and they could sustain a person like meat could. But, after the deluge, when food was damaged, and man was to be scattered to the edges of the land and far off isles for at that point hot and cold (weather) were introduced, so meat was needed for the maintenance of his health. Also, after they all lived through the actions of Noah who provided for them in the ark, they were like his acquisitions and in his possession. Also, because man originally wasn't on the level of "speaker" - only of "living" so only "growing" things were permitted to him. There was no difference between him and animals except that animals were given green vegetation to eat and man was given vegetation that produce seed, meaning fruit. Now, man was elevated to the level of "speaker." Just as there is no wrongdoing in the "living" consuming the "growing" for it is elevated in this manner as it become part of the body of the "living"thing, so too there is no wrongdoing if a "speaker" eats something "living" and it is elevated to become part of the body of the "speaker. This is what is meant by "like the green vegetation, I have given you all." Meaning: just as I prepared food for the animals to eat of the green vegetation [as is written: "and to all the animals of the field, all green vegetation for eating] because it elevates it to the level of "living," so too I have given you all, that you should eat all seed producing vegetation since you are also "living" beings and you should eat animals since you are "living speakers" and anything more lowly is fit to be the sustenance of that which is greater than it.

Verse 1


<b>Ninety-nine years old.</b> Since Yitzchak was to be holy from the womb and the progenitor of a holy nation, he was conceived after his father reached extreme old age when his physical nature was ebbing and his spiritual nature at its peak.

Verse 2

<b>I will give My covenant.</b> Hashem’s earlier covenant with him (15:18) was unilateral, but this one was “<i>between</i> Me and you,” imposing obligations upon both parties. Thus Avraham was also obliged to do his part to perfect creation, starting with his own body.

Verse 3

...This is the first time that the name, Elokim, is mentioned in God's speaking to Abraham. As we find that the name, Elokim, is attached to His creatures: "Elokei Avraham"; "Elokei Yitschak", Elokei Yisrael" - which is something that we do not find with the other names [of God]. As [this aspect of God] is diffused into the entire creation; such that from this angle, He is called Elokei HaOlam (the God of the world). And this is the name, Elokim, that is mentioned in the story of creation, in which he implanted the laws of nature... And there is [this aspect of God] that descends upon any man that is prepared for it, based on his preparation, like the forefathers... upon whom He had [this aspect] dwell upon in a different way that was elevated from [how this aspect] is found in nature...

<b>There is no fear of Elokim.</b> He informed him that even culture and refinement are no guarantee that a person’s passions will not overcome his intellect, leading him to commit the basest crimes. The only attribute that can be trusted to prevent him from sinning is fear — in particular fear of Heaven. <b>In this place.</b> There can be no fear of Heaven without belief in Providence.

Verse 12



Verse 13

<b>And it came to pass.</b> This is the third time, so that you should not think that I did this only in this place because I considered them to be wicked and sinful people. For when God caused me to wander from my father's house, He commanded me, saying, <b>'The Lord commanded me to leave my father's house and to go from place to place, like a wanderer on a path that has no specific location.'</b> Similarly, I am always prepared to change my location according to the commandment of God. And in places where the people are wicked and sinful, I said to her, <b>'In every place that we will come to, when we arrive at a new place, before we become acquainted with the nature and character of the people, you shall say of me, 'He is my brother.'</b> Thus, it turns out that I did not denigrate this land more than any other, for this is my constant practice.

Chapter 21



Verse 1

<b>Questions:</b> The repetition of, "And the Lord took account of, etc. and the Lord did etc." (Genesis 21:1). The question of the Ran, that he named him on the day of his birth and not on the day of his circumcision. That which is written (Genesis 21:5), "And Avraham was one hundred years old," is extra; as we already knew this from that which it stated a year before [Yitzchak] was born, after the circumcision of Avraham, that he was ninety-nine years old! That which is written (Genesis 21:7), "Who would have declared to Avraham, that Sarah will nurse children" - what did it want with this?
<b>And the Lord took account of Sarah:</b> I have already explained in Ayelet HaShachar that when the noun precedes the verb, it indicates that the thing was earlier than this. So [here] it means to say that still before Avimelekh took her, she was already pregnant from Avraham. And that is according to the opinion of Rabbi Chama in the Midrash that she gave birth in seven truncated months. For that is why, at the time Avimelekh took her, her fetus was not noticeable. But if she gave birth in nine months, they would say that she became pregnant from Avimelekh and that she gave birth in seven truncated months. But the opinion that says she gave birth in nine month reasons that God took account of Sarah after the story with Avimelekh, and that the story with Avimelekh was ten or eleven months before her giving birth. So they would have known  [this way] also that she did not get pregnant from Avimelekh. And that which the noun comes before the verb (making it past perfect) is to teach the connection of the deed [that was mentioned before it]: That by way of his praying for Avimelekh, the Lord took account of Sarah - like the matter that they said (Bava Kamma 92a), "Whoever prays for his fellow, when he himself also is in need of that very thing, will be answered first." <b>And the Lord took account:</b> There is a distinction between saying (<i>amirah</i>) and speaking (<i>dibbur</i>), as I wrote at length in the book, HaTorah VeHaMitzvah (Leviticus 3). As speech also signifies the explanation of the things. And there is a distinction between remembered (<i>zakhar</i>) and took account of (<i>pakad</i>). As taking account of, is always to do some thing for [the other]. So first God said, in Parashat Lech [Lecha] (Genesis 17:19), "Indeed, your wife Sarah will bear you a son." And that is called saying. But it was [only] fulfilled when He took account of her to have her conceive. And afterwards (Genesis 18:14), He spoke and explained through an angel and limited "the time that I will return to you," that it would be on Pesach of the next year. And about this it stated, "and the Lord did to Sarah as He had spoken."

Verse 2

<b>And she conceived:</b> This verse explains the previous verse - that which is written, "And the Lord took account of Sarah as He had said," since, "Sarah conceived and gave birth." And that which is written, "and the Lord did to Sarah as He had spoken," since it was, "at the set-time of which God had spoken." And likewise did it say in the Midrash (Bereishit Rabbah 52:13), "I, the Lord, have spoken and I have done' (Ezekiel 37:14) - where did He speak? 'At the set time I will return to you' (Genesis 18:14). 'And I have done' - as it is written, 'and the Lord did to Sarah as He had spoken.'" And it comes out like Rabbi Yehudah [Rabbi Nechemiah] (Bereshit Rabbah 53:5): "'And the Lord took account of Sarah as He had said' - that which He had said in an utterance. 'And the Lord did to Sarah as He had spoken' - that which He had spoken to her though an angel."

Verse 3

<b>And he called:</b> Behold, God commanded Avraham, "your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will name him Yitzchak" (Genesis 17:19) - and he had to implement this immediately on the day that he was born; and He commanded him to circumcise him on the eighth day. So Avraham implemented, "And he called his son's name," immediately; and he circumcised, "when he was eight days old" (Genesis 21:4). And about both of them, it stated, "as the Lord had commanded him." And it stated, "that was born to him, to which Sarah had borne to him" - as it was written, "your wife Sarah will bear you a son" - that is to say, a son who will be the heart and treasure that will be descended from you. As this could only be from the righteous woman, Sarah. 

Verse 4



Verse 5

<b>Avraham was one hundred years old:</b> Since at the time that it was announced to Avraham that he would father a son, he fell "on his face and laughed and said in his heart, 'Can a hundred year old man have children'" (Genesis 17:17). And he laughed with joy about the miracle that He would do to him; so God told him that he should call him Yitzchak based on this laughter (<i>tzchok</i>). And afterwards when Sarah heard of the announcement, she also laughed with joy, as she went back to her youthfulness and would bear a child in the natural way; whereas Avraham would remain in his old age and require a miracle - as I wrote in  my commentary there. According to this, it can be said that that which Avraham called the name of this son Yitzchak was because "Avraham was one hundred years old when his son Yitzchak was born to him." As he laughed and rejoiced about this - "can a hundred year old man have children?" And he was commanded to call him Yitzchak based on this. But about this, Sarah said (Genesis 21:6) that "God made for me" the main laughter and miracle - he made a greater miracle for me, to the point "that anyone who hears," will not laugh about the miracle of Avraham. Rather he "will laugh for me," about the miracle that was done for me. And she explained the thing - that even though I went back to my youthfulness, and based on this, the birth was in the natural way, nevertheless...

Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>Who declared to Avraham that Sarah would nurse children?</b> Since that which Avraham fathered [a child] in his old age - he was promised about that from God. And God said to him that he would father a son from me; so this is not a wonder, that the word of God would materialize. But that which I am nursing children and have milk to nurse, there was no promise about that at all. Who declared and forecast this miracle? Is it not that this was not announced, not by God and not by an angel? So why was this miracle done, once I have already "borne him a son in his old age," and God's promise already materialized? And why should this miracle be prolonged also after the birth, that an old woman should have milk in her breasts to nurse children? As this miracle is superfluous, since I could have given him to a wet-nurse. So in that case, God did this miracle only for laughter and joy; so that the whole world would laugh and rejoice about this miracle.

Verse 8

<b>And the child grew:</b> [So] that you do not say that he was born a weakling from the elderly people - as he grew. And do not say that he was weaned because she did not have milk in order to nurse, since he was not weaned until he grew. As the miracle of the milk continued until he grew like one [fit to be] weaned from his mother. <b>And Avraham made a great banquet:</b> He did not make a banquet at the time of the circumcision, since the circumcision was a commandment specific to him and the circumcised members of his household. So he only made a small banquet before them. But at the time of the weaning, he made a great banquet for the great ones of the generation, as the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said.

Verse 9

<b>Questions:</b> Why did Sarah request that he should drive out Yishmael; and, in particular, what was the sin of the maidservant? And why did God agree to this, on account of, "for it is through Yitzchak that your seed will be called" (Genesis 21:12); and why should he drive him out because of this? That which is written, "and she sat across from him" (Genesis 21:16) twice. That which is written (Genesis 21:17), "there where he is," has no explanation.
<b>And she saw:</b> And then at the time of the banquet, Sarah saw that Yishmael was laughing and scorning about this banquet. But it did not explain what [the cause of] the laughter was, but only hinted [by] that which was written, "that she had born to Avraham" - that he said, like the mockers of the generation, that Sarah got pregnant from Avimelekh and that only he was born from Avraham. And Sarah recognized that his mother had incited him to this laughter, since that which the son of Sarah was preferred to her son was bad in her eyes. And based on that, it called him, "the son of Hagar the Egyptian," and did not call him by the name, Yishmael. It was because she saw that his mother had incited him to [do] this.

Verse 10

<b>And she said:</b> That is why she requested that he drive out the maidservant, who incited him, and also drive out her son with her. Since she thinks that he should inherit equally with Yitzchak - or that he has an advantage over Yitzchak, according to her mockery. But the truth is that he will not inherit, from the perspective that he is the son of the maidservant; as the offspring of a maidservant is [considered to have a status] like her. And he would not inherit with him, from the perspective that [Yitzchak] was his son, the son of the lady; and from the perspective that he was Yitzchak, who was born by a miracle and is the heart and the treasure.

Verse 11

<b>And it was bad:</b> Sarah began that he should drive out the maidservant, since she thought that the main love of Avraham was for his concubine, and he loved his son along with her, as well. But Scripture testifies that the essence of what was bad in the eyes of Avraham was "on account of his son."

Verse 12

<b>And he said:</b> Based on this, God said to him, "Do not let it be bad in your eyes concerning the youth and concerning your maidservant." Since the main thing that was bad in your eyes was concerning the youth - and due to him, it was also bad in your eyes concerning your maidservant, as she is the mother of the youth - from this, it is understood that you consider him to be like your son. Therefore "listen to the voice (<i>bekol</i>) of Sarah" (it has been explained with me that listening <i>bekol</i> is to do like her words) - that if you think that he is your son who will inherit you like Yitzchak, it is a mistake. For it is only "through (lit., in) Yitzchak that your seed will be called" - as the heart and the treasure is only in Yitzchak, meaning in Yaakov who will be born from him. And the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Nedarim 31a), "'In Yitzchak,' and not all of Yitzchak." And they said that one who makes a vow [not to benefit] from the seed of Avraham is permitted [to benefit from] the seed of Yishmael and Esav, since they are not called by the name of Avraham but rather by the name of Yishmael and Esav. And if you are concerned about sending him away from you, lest he die of hunger or that which is similar, I promise you - even though he is the son of the maidservant and is not related to you but only to her, nevertheless - "I will make him into a nation," from the perspective "that he is your seed."  

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b>And he got up early:</b> It recounts the righteousness of Avraham, that he got up early in the morning to implement the commandment of God. Such that he did not give silver and gold into her hand. Rather, "he took bread," since Sarah had said (Genesis 21:10), "drive out this maidservant." And there is a difference between, "drive out," and "send away": With the sending away of slaves, it is written (Deuteronomy 15:13), "you shall not send them away empty." For sending away is with goodness, but driving out is with a strong hand and with anger. And he gave [it] himself to Hagar, and not through an agent, since his mercy was not moved at all. <b>He placed it on her shoulder:</b> Such that he did not allow her to eat in his house and go afterwards; rather he placed [it] on her shoulder. <b>And the child:</b> After he placed [it] on her shoulder, he sent her away with the child, to show her that the main expulsion was hers, because she incited the child to laugh. And on account of her, he is also sending away the child. And he did this so that the child would not be be disgusting in her eyes. <b>And she went and strayed:</b> As he did not send one of his servants to show her the way; sending her without accompaniment, which was not like his way even with guests who were strangers. As he would walk with them to send them away. For he kept the commandment of God.

Verse 15

<b>And she cast (<i>tashlech</i>):</b> [Casting] is about leaving and abandoning, as [in], "for You have picked me up and cast me (<i>tashlicheni</i>)" (Psalms 102:11). And it explains the casting - "and she went and sat across from him." And after she heard there also the voice of the youth yelling out, she sat even further away across from him.

Verse 16



Verse 17

<b>And He heard:</b> This is [along the lines of], "Though my father and mother have abandoned me, the Lord will take me in" (Psalms 27:10). "As God has heard the voice of the youth (meaning that He accepted his prayer, as that is the definition of listening which is followed by [the word,] God) there where he is" - meaning to say that in the place in which the youth was, a well of water was found there. And it can also be explained that it means to say [that] since God was found there, He was looking over him him and available to save him.

Verse 18

<b>Get up:</b> Hence, "Get up and lift the youth," while he is still sick. And afterwards, "grasp him with your hand," and  he shall be 'a staff in hand and a hoe for burial' (a source of support in her old age).

Verse 19

<b>And He opened (<i>Vayifkach</i>):</b> The definition of the verb, <i>pakach</i> is revealing knowledge that one did not know previously, like the Rambam writes in the Guide [for the Perplexed]. As the well was also there at the beginning; it is just that she had not paid attention to see it. But now she saw it. 

Verse 20

<b>And God was with:</b> He had God's providence over him, so that he would grow, and He saved him from the danger of the wilderness and from bad animals. "And he dwelled in the wilderness," fulfilling that which was written (Genesis 16:12), "And he will be a wild man," as he was a man of the wilderness. "And he was an archer" - so that which was written, "and his hand will be against all," was fulfilled. "He dwelt in the Wilderness of Paran" (Genesis 21:21) - so that which was written, "and in the presence of all his brothers shall he reside," was fulfilled; as he would wander from one wilderness to another wilderness. And the nature of [this] root was implanted afterwards in his children. <b>And his mother took for him a wife from the land of Egypt:</b> 'Every raven [sticks] to its type.'

<b>I am a foreigner (or “sojourner”) and a resident.</b> A sojourner does not usually purchase a family burial plot because he does not intend on remaining. Conversely, a resident does not need to buy one because he possesses his own land. Avraham, however, has been a sojourner until now but would like to become a resident. That is why he is seeking to purchase a plot.

Verse 5

<b>In the choicest of our grave sites.</b> Because you are so respected you may have the best grave in the public cemetery, or else you may request the private plot of anyone in town. But it is against our custom to allow a sojourner to acquire a plot of his own.

And she removed her widow's weeds. To show that she doesn't want to be obligated to yibbum, after she was not given to Shelah even after he grew up, from this she was freed from the obligation of yibbum.

Verse 3

And his master saw - He didn't pay attention to the successes that were natural, but he did pay attention to the successes that were providential: "he saw that Ad-nai was with him". And we have an indication that we should make a distinction between these two types of success. The natural success is brought to those who succeed through issues that are obviously successful in nature, such as one sells something that is searched for, and obviously succeeds, but this won't happen if he chooses to sell things that can't be sold well. But the providential success is actually the opposite, that if he can't have luck, and chooses things that are bad and cannot bring success, despite all this the things are changed to being good through providence against nature. And Yosef had those two different types of success, natural and providential. His master recognized "that Ad-nai was with him", through seeing "that all that he does" - that he succeeded even things that he did that were not naturally successful, because "Ad-nai lent him success" - [meaning] God transformed into success what was "in his hand" through Ad-nai and His providence.
